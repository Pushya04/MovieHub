"Great songs and a good villain make ""Aladdin"" a Disney classic.","This movie has three elements that are important for an animated Disney movie: Great songs, a good villain and a great sidekick.The songs and music in general are just great and very memorable. Jafar is a great villain mainly because he is voiced by Jonathan Freeman who has got a good and scary voice. But what is maybe the best element of the movie is Robin Williams as the blue genie. The blue genie is like a jokemachine that once it is started can't stop again and keeps you laughing.The story is good and the pace is high. ""Aladdin"" is not too short and it's not too long, it's not too immature and it's not too mature, it's a perfect movie for the entire family with a wonderful love story (even though it's no ""Beauty and the Beast"") and good animations with some good looking early computer effects.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Fantastic!,"Magic, adventures, laughs, love... This film has everything mixed, and the result is quite good! The film is about the classic tale of ""Aladdin and the magic lamp"", so the story is well known by everybody. Despite it is for children, the quality of the characters is very good, the story, though predictable and typical, results interesting and, which is more important, it males us to spend a good hour and a half. The songs (typical in Disney) never are boring, and are surprisingly well mixed with images. In addition, action scenes are well ended and most characters are very charismatic. Aladdin is sympathetic form the beginning and most secondary characters are simply perfect. The ""acting"" of the Genius is superb in his strangeness and absurd, and Yafar is well remembered as one of the ""best"" bad ones of the history of cinema. It exhales an immense aura of evilness hardly ever seen in a movie... To sum up, one of the best (maybe the best) Disney film made, which everything to have a nice afternoon with your children or just spending a nice time laughing and remembering when you were a child.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Hilarious,"I think this is one of the funniest films that Disney has ever done. This is due entirely to Robin William's brilliant voice of the Genie. He is wonderful in this role. I think the animation is pretty fair although I dislike the ""generic"" people that Disney's shop is putting out these days. They all share the same basic facial structure and eyes, so there is not much difference between any of the characters. It's not like Sleepy, Doc and Sneezy, who all looked very different. Still, this is a great and funny film. It is totally clean and not very violent so it is appropriate for every member of the family. Give this one a try and you'll have a great time watching it!",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
This film is so good!,"I grew up watching this film and along with Beauty and the Beast and Cinderella it is one of my favourite Disney films. I love it! Robin Williams is so good in it. He's hilarious. This film isn't just for kids but for the whole family. I think I was about 5 when I first saw it and at 14 I still watch it and so do my parents. I haven't seen the sequels because I heard that Robin Williams wasn't in them and decided that they wouldn't be as good without him. He was made for the part. The songs are amazing. I love singing along to ""A Whole new World"". I'm hoping to get the soundtrack soon. I also love the film because I have the same name as the princess in it! I would definitely recommend it to everyone. You're never too old to watch a classic Disney film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Great movie!,"Simply a classic. The movie Aladdin is hilariously told with many many MANY funny moments. The genie his an all-time high in this classic film about a street rat and a princess. A great movie for young kids, but even adults will love the wonderfully amusing lines throughout the story.The songs in the movie are well-known and catchy. I even had a guy since one of them to a girl at a school dance! Everyone recognizes them, and it is our duty to make sure the next generations continues to appreciate such a wonderful work of art.A great movie for the entire family to sit down and watch together, it's good sometimes to take a blast to the past and enjoy some of those good ol' movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
"Robin Williams,  Great Songs Make This One Of The Best Animated Films Ever","I can think of three quick reasons why this has remained one of the best animated movies ever: 1 - Very good, very catchy songs that still sound good 15 years later; 2 - excellent, colorful visuals; 3 - the unique humor of Robin Williams, who seems to spout a joke-a- second. In fact, you have to pay close attention to hear Williams' lines because they come so fast and furious. Actually, at times they are too fast. You hardly have time to laugh or digest what he just said when another line hits you. Williams' genie character doesn't appear on screen until after the first third of the film is over.Without all those jokes - and the great visuals that go with those gags (things popping up like Saturday morning cartoons), this would just be a routine Disney animated film. Part of the normal Disney fare includes a hero who is a good guy but a liar and a heroine who is the typical wasp-waisted beauty who is rebellious against the rules of the day. The villain is an ""Oil Can Harry"" mustached dastardly employee of the king who desires king-like powers. His scenes, however, are tempered with humor thanks to his New York City-sounding obnoxious parrot, who provides most of the movie's slapstick humor.Maybe the best attribute of this film is simply how fast it moves, meaning it's very, very entertaining.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
great fun,"This movie was the biggest film of '92, and it's easy to see why-a lotta fun, as a terrific Robin Williams performance carries it to heights it otherwise would not have gone to. Great animation, fine songs, a decent plot--what is there not to like? I will admit some of the Arab characters seemed to be stereotyped-but no more so than in Mulan or Tarzan or whatever; animation seems to stereotype Everything.A great movie, ***1/2 outta ****, a fave then and now.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
S10 Reviews: Aladdin (1992),"Disney animation strikes pay dirt again with ""Aladdin"". Aladdin is an orphaned ""street rat"" who, with his cheeky monkey Abu takes what they need to survive the harsh reality of their situation. All with a song in his heart. But Aladdin gets mixed up in a nefarious plot by Jafar (and his hilariously funny foul-mouth parrot Iago) the adviser to the sultan. Like most of the cinematic madmen Jafar has hatched up a glorious scheme to bring the world to its knees but there is a catch. A person pf pure spirit is the only one who can grab a mystical lamp which is the heart of his plan. When things go wrong for Jafar (thanks to that quick monkey) Aladdin discovers the secret of the lamp and the comic hilarity that lay inside. Aladdin gets three wishes from the *ahem* Genie in the bottle (voiced by the perfectly cast Robin Williams) and Al's life will never be the same. Will Aladdin fulfill his deepest desires or will he rescue the princess and take a magic carpet ride into the sunset? ""Aladdin"" is a beautiful melding of computer generated and standard animation that paved the way for Disney's best feature (The Lion King). Wonderfully magical story with some seriously crazy comedians at work, ""Aladdin"" is great fun for the whole family.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Vintage Robin Williams,"I did not care to see this movie, but I was such a big Robin Williams that I rented it long after it stopped playing in the theaters. From the first few scenes I was spellbound by the voices and the script.I can still mimmick nearly all of the Genie's themes as well as see myself play Aladdin in a live action version of this movie with Paula Abdul as Jasmine and John De Lancie as Jafar. Jasmine in this movie has the same sexual innocence as Ariel the Little Mermaid and Krysta of Fern Gully. The songs are infectious, especially ""Friend Like Me"" and ""A Whole New World."" The whole movie is one big roller coaster ride augmented by the raucous wit of Robin Williams and his own talent for mimmicry and improvisation.

Forever a favorite of mine ...,"I will never forget the first time I watched ""Aladdin"", I was with a group of friends waiting in the airport for the plane that would take us from Orlando to Paris at the time when ""Aladdin"" was the 'big thing' in the USA while some previews of ""The Lion King"" were starting to screen. ""Aladdin"" will forever be associated to that wonderful week I spent in Disneyland, and it's only fitting if the movie is my favorite Disney film, slightly edging-out ""The Jungle Book"".I know I can get all rational in this review, analyzing what makes ""Aladdin"" such an appealing film and using the expected words of 'Disney Renaissance' and a comparison with the glorious Best Picture nominee predecessor. I can also talk about the animation, the music, the extraordinary multi-vocal performance of Robin Williams as Genie but I don't feel like getting rational. I love the film for personal reasons that are essentially due to the excellent timing of this film in its penetration of my pre-adolescent life. ""Aladdin"" took a forever cherished place as one of the last treasures that enriched my childhood even playing a pivotal role in the way I would start enjoying cartoons.""Kid's day in the USA!"" was the motto of the week that was celebrating the 65th birthday of Mickey Mouse, and for a kid who never traveled outside his country, going to Disneyland was the most unexpected destination, the most extraordinary trip I would never have dared to dream of. This is when I discovered ""Aladdin"", through the 'Prince Ali' fanfare endlessly performed during the parades, through the films' images aired on TV; something was strangely attracting me to the film. And I guess the fact that I knew the story helped a lot: I grew up with a French cartoon from 1969, titled 'Aladin and the Magic Lamp' recorded in an 80's videocassette, a movie I can recite (and sing) by heart, and there was also an obscure Manga 'Aladdin' film we watched at school before the summer holidays.Needless to say I was already familiar with the story, and seeing it translated into Disney language was something I was excited to see. Would they talk about Aladdin's deceased father Mustapha? Would he live with his mother? What kind of roles would Genie play? Well one thing matters apart from these questions: I knew the story and I could understand the film even if I didn't speak English at that time  it wouldn't have helped me anyway because the airport was very noisy, so I just sat on my luggage, eating some candies, and I could understand who was who and what was everyone's scheme: obviously, Aladdin wanted to be a prince to marry the princess and Jafar to marry the princess to become the prince, and between them, the Genie would come to fulfill their dreams. So, I saw the film and I loved it.And for one year, before I would see it again, the music of 'Pince Ali' and 'A Whole New World' was the musical remembrance of that magical week in Disney World. And when I saw it again, it took another dimension: I finally understood the subtleties of the stories, I learned all the songs after repetitive viewings, and for months and months, I was transported by the 'Prince Ali' parade and its climactic conclusion and the romantic 'A Whole New World' and its beautiful opening, when Jasmine jumps on the carpet and the zoomed-out Rajah looks smaller and smaller, watching from the balcony. I saw the film so many times during my pre-teen years that I would never forget the first sensations it immersed me into, with an unexpected awkward one.I must confess that Jasmine was one of my first movie crushes and my idea of the ideal woman as a kid, I don't know why but the way she looked during the 'love at first sight moment' hypnotized me and the moment where I always melt occurs in the carpet ride, when Aladdin gives her the apple, when you understand that she understood who the Prince Ali is, there are no words to describe how incredibly sexy she looks at that very moment. The crush didn't last of course, and as I grew older and was disappointed with the 'Return of Jafar' sequel and the TV series, my interest for ""Aladdin"" declined and it was reduced to 'kid's stuff I used to like'.And then 10 years later, as a student, I saw the film again on my computer, eating a pizza, and something magical happened when the 'Whole New World' music started during the closing credits, my heart was inundated by a nostalgic torrent, so immense that I couldn't stop crying because it reminded me of the privileged place the movie occupied once in my heart. The magic was back, and whenever I was spending a good time with friends, we were having fun listening to these old Disney songs, and the clip of 'A Whole New World' was a must-see  and how glad I was to discover that I wasn't the only one who 'liked' Jasmine.I feel so concerned by this film and so deeply attached to it, that I don't want to spoil this review with critical or ecstatic reviews, the film is just thrilling, romantic, adventurous, and features certainly the greatest cast of supporting characters without it being the counterpart of a dull hero or heroine, there's not a single minute of the film that seems pointless and wasted and certainly not with a character like Genie. That's the best I could do to rationally 'explain' my love for ""Aladdin"".But maybe because loving a film can also depend on external factors that influence your judgment, in the case of ""Aladdin"", everything contributed to make this my favorite Disney film ... for sentimental reasons yes, but who ever said they were wrong?",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
IMHO,"This movie is one of the better Disney animated films in recent years. Cute story, fun, light, entertaining and a catchy score to boot this is actually quite tolerable. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Not very timeless.,"I believe this is the first of the more recent full-length animated feature films to lose the ""Disney touch."" For some good points first, the animation is great and story had potential, about a poor street urchin named Aladdin who meets a princess in disguise, the palace-fatigued Jasmine, on the streets. They fell in love with each other afterward, but the only problem is that Princess Jasmine can only marry a prince according to palace standards. Thrown in the mix is the evil vizier Jafar, who wants to control the land, and the slapstick Genie of the Lamp. And, the music is great - ""A Whole New World"" is breathtaking and ""One Jump Ahead"" is very catchy.However, I do not believe the screenplay/story is very captivating, lacking the charm and uniqueness that was found in previous films like ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Little Mermaid."" The movie was told in a way that resembles a teenage-bop love story. Some of the characters, particularly that of the Genie, was very over-the-top. Robin Williams did a very overzealous voice acting job for the character and he seemed too comedic and nonsensical. He made too many modern-day references, considering this movie is supposed to be set in ancient times. And, the character of Aladdin took on too much of a ""surfer dude"" personality - not very genuine.Overall, I'll admit I'm probably in the minority, at least on IMDb, for negatively critiquing this movie. But, ""Aladdin"" ranks as one of my least favorite movies from Disney.Grade D+",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
My favorite animated movie.,"From start to finish, Aladdin is timeless classic! Very funny, very exciting and intense, amazing visuals, and excellent pacing! The story is also amazing, as are the characters. Holy crap do the characters in this movie rock! They all play a very important role in the movie. You have Aladdin and Abu as two fearless adventurers/thieves, Jasmine as one of the best and most charming Disney princesses of all time, Jafar as the highly cunning, intelligent, and awesome sorcerer and one of the best Disney villains of all time, Iago, who has to be the best henchman of any villain in any movie (he and Jafar are the best together), and of course, the Genie. From his design to his style to pretty much everything there is about him, he absolutely steals the show! From the moment he appears during the movie, he is just seems so much like the the star of the movie. Robin Williams as the Genie is one of the best performances in any animated movie. Aladdin is such an awesome movie that I can't give it anything other than 10 out of 10",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Aladdin is a beautifully constructed film. that is for me one of Disney's best!,"Aladdin is a brilliant movie. Sure, it isn't as good as Beauty and the Beast, but I think it is definitely one of my favourite Disney movies. It is beautifully constructed, with some of the best animation sequences of recent times. The music score is just delightful. How can I ever forget the animated sequence to ""A Whole New World?"" Perfect. Jafar is one of Disney's finest villains, voiced with relish by Jonathan Freeman. Unfortunately, like Shere Kahn, he was another Disney villain that was ruined by a DTV sequel. Aladdin and Jasmine's romance is so believable, and while people have said they are bland, they do appeal to you soon enough. And for me Jasmine along with Esmeralda is one of the sexiest female Disney characters. I actually found it hard to tell what was computer animated, whereas there have been some movies that make a mess of that. I want to guess what is computer animated. The best aspect of this movie, is a hilarious performance from Robin Williams as the Genie If he hadn't ad-libbed so many of his lines, the script could have won an Oscar- that said his genie was a perfect match and fitted with the story very well. Some people say the movie starts off slow. But with the songs and animation, that really isn't an issue. The movie also spawned the best DTV sequel, the King of Thieves. 10/10.

A whole new world. A new fantastic point of view...,"The 31st animated Disney classic is one of Disney's best known movies. It also takes us to a whole new world, a new fantastic point of view. This one takes place in Saudi Arabia. I've always liked this movie.""Aladdin"" is very entertaining and great fun. It is hilarious, creative, imaginative and romantic. It isn't a faultless movie, but it's a little difficult not to like it.I'll start by talking about the characters. The blue Genie is, without a doubt, the most amusing, hilarious, imaginative and genial Genie ever created. Robin Williams steals the show as the Genie's voice. With his incredible talent to do voices, he's hilariously awesome and fantastic as the Genie's voice (and also as the voice of the enigmatic merchant that appears at the beginning, who happens to be an interesting character).Iago is the funniest character of this movie, along with the Genie. Nobody better than Gilbert Gottfried to voice the sarcastic parrot. Iago is simply hilarious! He's rude, grumpy, sarcastic, hungry for power, malicious, obnoxious and foul-tempered. He has an irritating voice but in a funny way, as well as a great talent to perfectly mimic other characters's voices. However, deep down inside he has a heart. I also love his hate for crackers. I don't see why does he hates crackers so much, but that also makes him so funny! Besides, a parrot with teeth?? lol!Jafar is a great villain. Although often calm and humorous (for example, he keeps calling ""Prince Abooboo"" to ""Prince Ali""), he also represents the worst and most ambitious kind of villain and he is one of the most dangerous Disney villains. And he does possess a snake-like tone of voice sometimes.Princess Jasmine, what can I say? Have you ever seen a more beautiful Disney princess? She's just gorgeous! Despite her strong and challenging personality, I like her anyway.The Sultan is a funny dude. The Magic Carpet is lovable, one of my favorite characters from the movie. Aladdin himself is a nice guy, poor but kind-hearted (although dishonest, immature and selfish sometimes).Abu is funny mostly because of his vocal sounds, very Donald Duck-like. The Cave of Wonders is an amazing character. It is a giant tiger's head with an absolutely fantastic and brutal deep-throat voice.""Aladdin"" is a festival of magic, special effects, bombastic humor and jokes.By the way, I absolutely love the song ""A Whole New World"". The version sung by Aladdin and Jasmine is great, but the original version of Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle is better, deeper and more romantic and classic. It's a very romantic and joyful song, which is always a pleasure to listen. ""Arabian Nights"" is a nice song as well...I'd only wish that ""Aladdin"" hadn't become a victim of its own success. It inspired 2 sequels and several stories with these characters.This should definitely be on Top 250.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

"Lots of color and pep, good songs but derivative elements...","Sultan's daughter must marry a prince in three days or be forced to wed her father's version of a concierge, who drips with disdain and evil; meanwhile, young rogue Aladdin and his pet monkey have been allowed into a hallowed cave of treasures where they rescue a manic genie from a magic lamp. Presented in the much-missed, regrettably vanquished hand-drawn era of animation, ""Aladdin"" has in-jokes and borrowed jokes to spare (it pilfers mostly from ""Sleeping Beauty"", not to mention ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""). In fact, the movie doesn't seem to have much spirit of its own apart from Robin Williams and his vocal hamming (which was seen as a tour-de-force in its time). There are funny bits and pieces, beautiful designs and scene transitions, and the romance between the young people comes off well. It is a tad screechy and a little staid, with illogical rewrites to the Aladdin legend which do nothing but prolong the inevitable; however, the Disney magic is in evidence and the songs are fine.

The Clements/Musker Team,"""Aladdin"" is brought to us by the same team who made ""The Little Mermaid."" So, of course, this movie leaves me a little baffled. There are some things I like and some things I don't.ANIMATION: The best thing about the animation is the color of the look of Arabia. I didn't see this movie until last December; before I saw it, I heard about how great the colors and the lights were. Everything pops, it's bright, and it's great.SONGS/MUSIC: Sadly, this was the last Disney film to have Howard Ashman's work in it; he passed away before ""Beauty and the Beast"" was completed. Fortunately, he left us some really good songs in this movie, along with Alan Menken and Tim Rice. Not every song in this film is memorable, but they almost are. Of course everyone knows and loves ""A Whole New World,"" which both does sound nice and contributes greatly to the movie; we really see our main characters fall in love. My favorite song is ""Friend Like Me."" Not only are the lyrics, music, and animation great, but Robin Williams gets just as animated as the animation.ROMANCE: I mentioned our main characters' romance a bit earlier, and, again, you believe they're in love. Though, have you noticed this is the same romance we had in ""The Little Mermaid?"" The protagonist sees their romantic interest and falls in love. They save their life and admires them, but the two of them are kept apart for some reason. Then our protagonist has to take on a new form/identity to get their romantic interest to fall in love with them, the villain eventually tests their relationship, but they wind up being together again in the end...Huh. I don't see the downside in disliking their relationship, though. It still seems genuine. At least Aladdin has more time with Jasmine before he becomes a prince than Ariel did with Eric before she became human.CHARACTERS: Most of the characters are OK. Aladdin, Jasmine, and the Sultan are OK. Iago and the Magic Carpet are a little annoying, but they're not that bad. In my opinion, the Genie - again, voiced by Robin Williams - is the best character! When I was watching this last December I said to myself, ""This film is OK, but why was it a hit during the Disney Renaissance?"" Then the Genie came on the screen. He is the most entertaining thing in this movie! Robin Williams puts so much energy and passion in playing this role. I like that the Genie isn't just a funny, pop-culture referencing character; he actually has development to him. That makes him both likable and relatable. I don't like Abu, I think he's too annoying and too selfish. The character I can't figure out is the villain, Jafar. People have said he's one of the greatest Disney villains...Really? I'm glad you see that, but I don't. To me, he's not consistent. Based on what I saw of Jafar in the beginning of the movie, I didn't expect him to be the type who would dress as a crazy old man or have witty remarks with a parrot. That's not to say that Jafar can't be funny, but did you really think the guy we saw in the beginning of the movie would speak as he did throughout the movie? Not only that, but his power is weak! Did you notice the Sultan did not fall under Jafar's spell when he tried to hypnotize him before the ""Prince Ali"" number? Why? What made him come out the spell so easily? He did it TWICE! Jafar's victims can decide when they'll be hypnotize? And why is his evilness so obvious, yet so hidden from everyone else? Out of all the times he's hypnotized the Sultan, NO ONE NOTICED?! Aladdin realized something was wrong the first time he saw it happen - no one else in the palace ever saw it?!STORY: The story is OK, I guess. One thing bothered me, though: in the beginning, Jasmine tells the Sultan she doesn't want to be forced to be married, she wants to marry for love (Blah, blah, blah, we've heard it before). At the end of the movie when Aladdin and Jasmine come together, the Sultan decides to let them marry. ""Am I Sultan, or am I Sultan,"" he asks. ""From this day forth, the Princess will marry whomever she deems worthy."" WHY IN THE CRUD DIDN'T HE DO THAT BEFORE!??! He could have stopped this whole thing from happening...MUCH LIKE ARIEL IN ""The Little Mermaid!!!"" Gosh! What's up with the Clements/Musker team?CONCLUSION: I couldn't go into too much detail, but you get the gist of it. There are some things I really like, some things I'm indifferent to, and some things I don't like. Overall, I still like this movie, though. I surprisingly find myself attracted to how entertaining this movie is, even the weird Jafar moments. I like it, and hopefully you will too. BOOYIKA!",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Aladdin is a fine children's cartoon.,"Aladdin is one of the many Disney Classics. Like the others, Aladdin has songs, detailed animation, and a good versus evil setting. It is pretty predictable, and has a main character who usually falls in love with some pretty girl.One of Aladdins many strong points was the talented voice acting of Robin Williams. The ability to portray so many different and silly characters that the genie does is one of the best parts in the movie. It is similar to how Eddie Murphy got to play Mushu in Mulan.Something else remarkable about this film was the storyline. The storyline starts off with Jafar (the villain) trying to find the Magic Lamp which will give him three wishes. Jafar finds the Cave of Wonders, in which the lamp is hidden. However, the cave won't let just anybody in. The only person who can enter the cave is a ""street rat"" named Aladdin. Meanwhile, Aladdin is stealing a loaf of bread and running away from the guards. Of course, this means a song would be involved. So, while singing a-long with the guards, Aladdin is stealing a loaf of bread because he has no money. Another plot that is happening at this time, is Jasmine's story. Jasmine has to marry a prince, but doesn't seem to like any of the ones her father picked out for her. The three character's quests and stories later merge together to make the main storyline.However, in the storyline there is one small flaw. How come Aladdin is the only person who can enter the Cave of Wonders? That's what I have been wondering. Is it just to make a storyline?Anyways, ignoring that detail, I wanted to say that it seems like Aladdin has a little something for everyone. It has action for the little boys. Girls may like the romance. Little children will probably like the singing and the fact that it's a cartoon. Finally, dads will probably enjoy the fact that Robin Williams is doing the voice acting in this film. (My dad does anyways, and requested to put that in there.)

"Not that good, actually...","I don't consider this a Disney ""classic."" I consider it the exact point where Disney started going downhill, and they have yet to come back up (with the exception of ""The Lion King,"" which was great). It is worth noting for the early computer animation, and the excellent voice work by Robin Williams, Gilbert Gottfried, Frank Welker, and Jonathan Freeman, but on the whole, this is nothing but a big Saturday morning cartoon. For one thing, the 2-D artwork is absolute crap. The characters look like they're off of cereal boxes, and even the backgrounds are shoddy. The animation is technically very good, but good animation isn't all that impressive if the characters are crudely drawn to begin with. Compare this to stuff like, say, ""Pinocchio"" to see the huge difference in effort and talent on the artists' part.For another thing, the songs in this one are horrible. Sure, the tunes are catchy, but has anyone taken time to listen to those LYRICS? ""Arabian nights/ Like Arabian days/ More often than not/ Are hotter than hot/ In a lot of good ways."" Wow, incredible. And how about this moving line: ""Would they see a poor boy? No siree. They'd find out there's so much more to me."" Seriously... ""no siree""!? I can't believe people get paid to write junk like that.Add the fact that Aladdin and Jasmine, our main characters, are bland and unlikeable, and you have a really bad movie.

The genie tends to overwhelm in the 2nd half of the movie, and the ugly character flaws, continual lying of the protagonist (not telling the princess who he really is - which also shows he can't read people b/c clearly she likes the street urchin), are bared for the audience to see in the 2nd half of the movie, which is why I am not rating this an 8 or 9.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

One of Disney's weaker recent efforts,"`Aladdin' caused a few ripples of shock in animation circles.  It seemed that Disney had started to pick up some tricks from Warner Brothers, like the rapid-fire topical references and Hollywood-star-of-the-day caricature. Most people were pleased.  It's orthodoxy in animation circles that the Warner Brothers style is a great one, much more lively than Disney's.I beg to differ.  Warner Brothers cartoons are under-characterised, talky, brash WITHOUT being energetic, and they don't age well.  They fail to be comic despite the fact that every other virtue is sacrificed for comedy's sake.  I wish it to be said that none of this applies to the very fine efforts of Chuck Jones.  SOME of his cartoons are masterpieces.  But some - the Pepe Le Pew series, for example - are dreadful; and what has happened here, I think, is that he has been poisoned by the Warner Brothers style. So too has `Aladdin' been poisoned.  In another decade everyone will have forgotten why Robin Williams was meant to be so funny and we will watch the genie only for Eric Goldberg's animation - which is technically superb, but a bit too literal, and too willing to follow Williams's lead.There are a couple of other flaws in `Aladdin' that will become more obvious as the years roll.  For one thing, the computer generated images just don't fit the other images.  (The Cave of Wonders is a visual debacle, which is sad, considering how good the rest of the art direction is.)  More importantly, Aladdin isn't an appealing hero.  Get this for shallow: he refuses to free the genie from servitude in order to perpetuate a deceit practised on Jasmine because of a crisis of confidence that, so far as one can tell from the opening song, he doesn't really feel.Of course we all know the film was a huge success, and it's not hard to see why: it offered the best character animation in the world, expertly staged songs, an uncynical look at an old story - all of the usual things, with a luscious princess thrown in.  Like ALL of Disney's recent animated films it's easy to enjoy.  But consider the other two of these films worked on by the team of Musker and Clements: `The Little Mermaid' and `Hercules'. `Aladdin', as much fun as it is, clearly lacks the heart of the former and the energy and technical brilliance of the latter, without offering a value-for-money trade off.  But don't let this stop you watching it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
I'm losin' to a rug!,"In most cases, ""Aladdin"" would just be another Disney cartoon. But Robin Williams as the Genie gives it everything that it needs! Whether it's his monologue when Aladdin first releases him, his Jack Nicholson imitation, or anything else, you're in for something hilarious. Approximately as funny as the Genie are Aladdin's pet monkey Abu, and villain Jafar's parrot Iago. Abu basically exists to spout out a bunch of ""ack"" sounds that only Aladdin can understand, while Iago basically exists to make sarcastic remarks and get injured. With these three, who needs Aladdin's relationship with Jasmine?! Even the Sultan provides a chuckle now and then.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
"Umm... no, thank you.","This movie was being hyped up the wazoo in all the newspapers in its day by critics all proclaiming that it deserved to do better than BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. Why they all thought that, I honestly had (and still have) no idea.I wanted to enjoy this movie. I really did. But when it came out in theatres, I found it only merely passable as ""Saturday morning cartoon"" entertainment and haven't been able to enjoy it since.After doing such huge leaps of art and faith which finally reached a powerful zenith with BEAST, which deserved to win Best Picture that year and was every bit as deserving of all its praise... what does The New Disney do next? An ""over the top"" cartoony film, a movie given over almost entirely to Robin Williams, and also... in all honesty... the beginning of the end.I had at first thought that this movie would be a brief ""detour"" for the studio in terms of comedic and artistic style, but everything in this movie has been rehashed by Disney so many times in an attempt to copy its success to the point of on-the-nose-predictable formula that it's safe to say ALADDIN completely destroyed the Disney tradition of lyrically beautiful animated films from the mouse house for good. We would never get another BEAUTY AND THE BEAST ever again.Want to feel alone in the world? Try saying you are unimpressed with ALADDIN. Try saying you don't like its songs. Try saying you think its animation looks cheap and unappealing. Try pointing out that there's no point to the nararrator at the film's beginning if he's never brought back to wrap things up. And, the biggest offense of all, try saying that you were un-wowed by Robin Williams' performance here despite the fact that you had usually enjoyed his work up to this point.I didn't care for all of Genie's modern-day references in a story that I had loved dearly as a child. I didn't like the self-conscious humour of everything else in it, either. And I also didn't like the sloppy inconsistencies in the art direction regarding the character designs.Now to be fair, maybe my disappointment had to do with the fact that The Denver Post's reviewer actually gave away the entire dramatic climactic surprise of this movie with the phrase ""My favourite part is..."" (I later wrote in a complaint to him at the paper saying, ""Thanks a heap for giving away the whole surprise ending in one sentence""). That might have taken all the tension out of the finale and such for me. That may be, but, given my reaction to the rest of the movie as a whole, I doubt it.I'm sorry, don't mean to step on anyone's toes, but I honestly just don't care for it that much.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

THoughts on this movie,"Just watched this recently, on the new-and-improved DVD which features a restored print, and it looks spectacular. The story is slightly shallower than the best of Disney's films, but this is balanced by the sheer lunacy of Robin Williams' bad, blue Genie. Whoever first thought of putting Robin Williams in a Disney flick should get a Pulitzer, or a Nobel, or something. The comic timing of his riffs combined with the comic timing of the animators transform the Genie from a ""Deus Ex Machina"" into the soul of ""Aladdin."" I have a tiny issue with the fact that the most recent VHS and DVD prints of the movie have bowed to pressure from activist groups and altered a line in the opening song. The original line was, ""...where they cut if your ear if they don't like your face/It's barbaric, but hey, it's home."" The revised line reads, ""...where the land is immense and the heat is intense/It's barbaric, but hey, it's home."" Protesters claimed the original line perpetuated a negative stereotype of Arab countries and peoples. But...but...but marketplaces and cities in Arabian countries still cut the hands off convicted thieves. And there's even a scene in the film which threatens to relieve the princess of an appendage. They're not being negative; they're being accurate. And, oh yeah, IT'S A CARTOON. But that's just my opinion.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

"Disney's greatest villain? (Well, one of the main contenders.)","Two people, from very different backgrounds fall in love, one has nothing, forced to steal to feed the poor, the other, wealthy and privileged, in their way, a villain named Jafar.It's been a while since I last watched this, I came here after recently watching the live action remake.It's one of the very best Disney movies of all time, made in the early 90's, a golden time for Disney in my humble opinion, the time of Beauty and The Beast and The Lion King, glorious.The visuals are stunning, it's a beautiful looking film, it's so bright and vibrant, it holds a massive appeal for the whole family.Aladdin is a great central character, he's fun, he's charming, he's from the school of hard knocks, he also does good, but for me the two most memorable characters, The Genie and Jafar.Jafar is one of the best Disney villains, he really is an evil, menacing force, Jonathan Freeman nails it.Robin Williams does a phenomenon job, what a talent, much missed.

Excellent animation - let's hope they keep making 'flat' (traditional) animation as well as the 3D computer-generated pictures.Don't get me wrong, this is worth a watch. Really.

Jafar is among the best Disney villains ever, voiced with pure villainy by Jonathan Freeman, and his parrot sidekick Iago is a perfect scene-stealer. Aladdin and Jasmine are very likeable and believable, but the best performance in the movie is by Robin Williams as the Genie.

Disney's second best,"This one is another example of the Disney guys' ability of traducing even the darkest stories to the screen. Aladdin is originally one of those dark stories with complicated language and plot, but directors Clements and Musker look beyond the obstacle and, once again, produce a great animated movie for children and adults. This film is wonderful. From the beginning, when a mysterious merchant sings one of the greatest ""onde upon a time"" songs ever, passing from the romantic moment, you are so fascinated with colors, camera movements and great voices, you can't take you eyes off of the screen. Incredible characters, a strong villain, good songs and breath-taking soundtrack and scenes, it has everything a Disney classic needs to be great. And this great would not be so great if Robin Williams wasn't the genie. What a talented guy. Jonathan Freeman as Jafar is not far behind, he helps the making of the best Disney villain. The characters animation is soft and beautiful, uninterested, the way the directors like. No matter the climax concludes with a (kind of) inexpressive phrase, it's only a minimum detail, and minimum details is for Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale (Beauty and the Beast), who seem to only care about that. Clements and Musker are a lot of steps ahead because they are the ones who inherited Walt Disney's magic. Let's hope they stay active for a good time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Sweet Arabian Skins,"This, to my mind, is a terrific concoction.It has no story to speak of. Oh, there's some motion and noise but they are only there to give us something to look at while the three main notions, all of which are magically competent.There are the songs. Disney can do this extremely well. At least they can recognize strong talent, manage and exploit it well. These songs by themselves carry the whole thing. This is not a cinematic experience, it is a musical one. You could enjoy this as well and perhaps even better by just listening.The second component is Robin Williams. There seem to be parallel contradictory histories about whether he was extemporizing or not. It hardly matters. He has narrative energy that at the time was unmatched. It's faded now.And the third thing? Well, this third thing has increased tremendously since 9-11. I saw this with ""Man on Wire.""Disney is the absolute expert at character design, so long as the characters are women. For some reason, male characters are not as rich and mineable. This project was the result of them building a map of female characteristics and structuring projects around them. Why this is so novel is that it is likely the last American film to have an Arab beauty in my lifetime. Now that Arabs are politically demonized by the bushies, it becomes impossible to treat these women as human and therefore appealing.Here we have a snapshot from the era before that became impossible. Of course, at the time it was essentially and insulting stereotype: exotic, superflat belly dancer tummy and ""orientally"" kinetic real end. There actually was at the time a Disney real end specialist.

The Blue Genie,"Two decades on and the animation looks nothing special, the story is rather so-so with the typical Disney flourishes but the Robin Williams voiced Genie is still infectious and makes the movie stand out.Williams is the heart and soul of this film, his free wheeling manner with rapid fire patter and impressions provided a new benchmark for guest star vocals in cartoons. You almost feel that Williams was ad libbing.The songs with 'A friend like me' and 'A whole new world' are endlessly hummable, the film has enough pizazz with despicable villains, animal or bird sidekicks but it reaches a higher gear whenever the genie turns up.Its nice to know Aladdin will in the future enchant a new generation of kids and these kids will hear the hilarity of Robin Williams humour through his characterisation of the genie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Disney's Aladdin meets Robin Williams' Genius,"It starts out as the usual raucous and routine Disney animated feature but over thirty minutes in a blue genie appears and as if by magic the film already very good is transformed into something special. Robin Williams and his manic vocal interaction with the cartoonery is sure fine looking, and still crazy after all these years: imho it was his best film.The old story of a poor street urchin who falls in love with a rich Princess, attains a magic lamp and the genie within who grants him three wishes; the rest is mythology. There are some nice atmospheric scenes and songs, with the plot holding up well with the sight and sound gags at many times running at the rate of one a second. So Pay Attention! The characterisations of Jafar and the Sultan from The Thief Of Bagdad are perfect, while Gilbert Gottfried also has a tour de force performance as the voice for Iago the brash parrot. There's the occasional dark moment which may scare the very young and me but it all adds up to a wonderful family film for children of all ages from 2 to 102.

Surprised by all the positive comments,"I found this Disney re-working to be an incredibly pedestrian affair, with the animation itself the only truly laudable aspect of the whole affair. The story is changed from the tale of old, and although I don't have a problem with that, the Americanisation of the character Aladdin and the endless spewing of anachronistic pop-culture references by Robin William's hyper-kinetic Genie give the film a plastic, manufactured feel.If Robin William's manic style of delivery isn't your cup of tea you're going to hate this film. While his character is intensely annoying, he does at least lift the film from the lethargic mire into which it had settled before he makes his belated entrance. The story is boring and predictable, the jokes weak and the songs mostly forgettable. The film's uneasy blending of modern-day materialistic preoccupation and Arabian Knights mythology doesn't work, and its sniffy dismissal of foreign cultures and positive assertion of Western aspirations borders on racism.

One of Disney's Best and Williams is outstanding,"There was a period during the early 90's where it appeared that Disney could do no wrong. Many of Disney's modern classics such as The Lion King and Beauty And The Beast were released during this period, and Aladdin can stand proudly alongside those two masterpieces.The main reason for this is Robin Williams' outstanding turn as the genie, which must surely rank as one of the best voice-over performances ever. Williams' genie steals every single scene he is in, thanks to the boundless energy and enthusiasm he brings, and he is big reason why adults will enjoy the movie just as much as their children. Apparently, Williams improvised a huge amount of the material and it is obvious from the moment Aladdin meets the big blue guy that we are in for something special. The nature of the character allows Williams to play around with impersonations, voices and in one or two scenes, some real emotional depth as well.He is undoubtedly the star of the show but that's not to say that the genie is the only good thing about Aladdin; the animation is fantastic, with one scene in which Aladdin must escape from a crumbling cave on his magic carpet being a particular highlight. We also have, in Jafar, one of Disney's most despicable and diabolical villains and many of the songs will have you tapping your feet and humming along. Like most of Disney's animated fare, the story is pretty straightforward and involves Aladdin trying to rescue his beloved Princess Jasmine from the evil clutches of Jafar, with the genie being his ace in the hole. It serves its purpose and manages to throw a few surprises in along the way, but the main attraction here is the genie, and he does not disappoint.One of Disney's, and Williams', finest hours.

Arguably the most influential and imitated film of the Disney Renaissance.,"In the Middle Eastern kingdom of Agrabah, the sultan's (Douglas Seale) trusted adviser and Grand Vizier, Jafar (Jonathan Freeman) works controls the Sultan through powers of suggestion and seeks to gain even more power by obtaining a magic lamp from The Cave of Wonders, but the cave will only allow one specific person to enter a ""diamond in the rough"". The sultan meanwhile is distracted by his willful daughter Princess Jasmine (Linda Larkin) who has rejected every suitor and by law must be married by her next birthday. Jasmine eventually leaves the castle disguised as a commoner and is saved by Aladdin (Scott Weinger) an orphaned thief who steals in order to eat and while projecting a cocky attitude also possesses a kind heart and the two form a friendship. Jafar soon learns the ""diamond in the rough"" is Aladdin and sends the guards to capture him despite Jasmine's attempts to dissuade the guards. Jafar disguises himself as an old prisoner and tells Aladdin of the Cave of Wonders which possesses immense treasure and promises it could be what he needs to see Jasmine again with Aladdin having fallen for her. While Aladdin obtains an old lamp from the Cave per the deal with the old man a combination of a sprung trap and Jafar's betrayal leaves him trapped. Aladdin rubs the lamp and unleashes a Genie (Robin Williams) who tells him he is his new master and is entitled to three wishes.The origins of Aladdin began with lyricist Howard Ashman who pitched a musical on Aladdin and the Magic Lamp from One Thousand and One Nights. The studio was initially dismissive of the project and was removed from active development with Ashman and writing partner Alan Menken going on to score the films The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast in the interim. Linda Woolverton who wrote Beauty and the Beast then refined Ashman and Menken's treatment which was soon chosen by Little Mermaid directors Ron Clements and John Musker as their next project passing on Swan Lake and King of the Jungle (which would become Lion King). The movie is notable for Robin Williams performance as The Genie which rather unusual for an animated film was tailored towards Williams' ability to ad-lib and his real life personality became not only a defining aspect of the character, but also the film itself (with some legal fallout that's a whole other story). Upon release the film was critically acclaimed and also a massive financial success as it was bolstered by a massive marketing campaign and ended up the top grossing film of 1992. The film still holds up as not only a showcase for impressive Disney animation, but also as a showcase for Robin Williams' talents as a comedian with these two coming together to create a solid musical adventure.The movie has a feel of older Arabian Nights movies such as 7th Voyage of Sinbad or The Thief of Baghdad if you filtered them through the glitz and glamour of Las Vegas, it's a strange combination when you step back and look at it because aside from the contemporary settings in Oliver & Company, Disney's animation division was typically focused on keeping things a least somewhat timeless in their approach and Aladdin sees more contemporary references and gags than had previously been attempted. I think that energized and contemporary style was what really resonated with people in this movie with Robin Williams and the attempt to make Aladdin look like Tom Cruise was so different and unique from what Disney had done before and it's a style that would maybe become a tad overindulged in the years following Aladdin's release with various Disney films and imitators trying (and mostly failing) to capture the same level of success with that style which would also lay the groundwork for the ""ironic"" takes on this material such as the Shrek films.The movie being more of an adventure film, there's some solid action on display in the chase and fight scenes with a magic carpet chase in the Cave of Wonders capturing the sensation of flight using a mixture of traditional animation overlayed on CGI or a climactic battle involving a giant cobra that harkens back to the creatures of Ray Harryhusen. Aladdin was one of the first films to be written by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio and you can see their love of classic Hollywood swashbucklers on display in Aladdin that would lead them to refine their style in other such projects like The Mask of Zorro or the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise with the mixture of high adventure and witty banter. The musical score by Alan Menken, the late Howard Ashman, and Tim Rice who took over for Ashman after his death are all well integrated into the story. The songs are very memorable with Ashman's Arabian Nights, Friend Like Me, and Prince Ali and Rice's One Jump Ahead and Prince Ali all well incorporated into the story and make for amusing character moments as well as furthering along the story.Aside from Robin Williams' scene stealing performance as The Genie, the film also features a likable set of characters and performances. Scott Weinger does well playing the likable scoundrel Aladdin who's only a thief by necessity but has a good heart beneath his cocky exterior, Linda Larkin's Jasmine is good as the ""princess in a gilded cage"" who while not on the same level as Belle or Ariel does show herself to possess both a fair amount of cunning and intelligence when called for it. But like any adventure story, it's only as good as its villains and we have some good ones. Jonathan Freeman's take on Jafar as a conniving power hungry schemer who manipulates the gullible sultan is the perfect mixture of his performance that alternates being sinister and deadpan funny but the addition of Gilbert Gottfried as Iago his parrot makes the two an enjoyable duo you love to hate.Aladdin is a solid effort from Disney animation and it's understandable why with how successful it was it became a trendsetter for animation whose legacy still endures (for better or worse). With rousing adventure, catchy songs, beautiful animation, and a scene stealing performance from Robin Williams as the Genie, Aladdin still holds up all these years later.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Some might commend this movie for being the first one with out an extremely pale Disney princess, but making her skin slightly darker doesn't change the fact that she's an even more out of touch brat.

One of Disney's best,"In this Disney family animation, street thief Aladdin runs into the princess and falls in love with her, but she can only marry a prince.It has been some years since we have seen a classic 2D animation as we enter a stage in film where everything is about visual effects rather than the narrative, and thankfully we have these wonderful films to look back on with a good solid plot, which is funny, strong and consistent throughout, and which is proper entertainment for the whole family.With brilliant characters with their own issues on their shoulders does the film achieve depth and variety for viewers, such as Aladdin wishing for more, Jafar wishing for power and Jasmine wishing for love. And its through these goals does the film become inspirational and enjoyable, and the one character who breaks all the boundaries is the genie.Robin Williams (Good Will Hunting) is the only person who could have made the genie what he is with a simply outrageous performance as the blue hero, with great magic, catchphrases and sing a longs. Easily the funniest character in Disney history in my personal opinion, the Genie has great charisma in helping others with his own personal life a sweet and soft moment for the film.There have been numerous times when I have watched this film and not noticed something different and it somehow seems to get better with every watch.Though does run on a few clichés there is no question that it does so in a very sophisticated and sentimental way which makes it feel more real and believable.The situations used and the ideology of good vs evil make the plot intense and exciting throughout. The use of magic was a very powerful device and makes the story even more special and brilliant.The film also has a terrific Oscar winning music score, which includes the outstanding song ""A whole new world"" which is possibly one of the best used songs in animation history.With a magical tale, great characters and a beautiful music score, Aladdin is a fantastic family animation and one of Disney's best.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
One of the best animated movies ever.,"One of my favorite Disney Classics, I remember as a child this was the movie that made me truly love Robin Williams, his portrayal of the Genie was hilarious. The movie has a great message and I remember as a kid not really understanding it completely, but as an adult, I truly appreciate that I was being bombarded with messages like the one this one presents. Also, Jafar is an extremely intimidating antagonist and the character is done to perfection, especially the whole snake sequence...still gives me the creeps.Love this movie and will definitely watch it again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

A massive highlight for Disney,"To be honest, even as a kid I didn't really like Disney films all that much - but there was one exception to that rule; and that was Aladdin. Maybe it was the characters, maybe it was the plot, or maybe it was simply the massive amount of fun that the film is; but something clicked then. And, upon seeing the film again as an adult; I can say that, despite the bar being raised for animation by the likes of Toy Story, Aladdin has lost none of what made it great upon release  and the fact that I enjoyed this film as much as my younger sister shows that Aladdin is fun for all ages. Because of the fact that animation has largely moved to 3D, there doesn't seem to be a lot of classic animation about; and that's a shame if you ask me, because I'd rather watch animation like this. The plot is, of course, based upon the classic story of 'Aladdin'; only it's been spruced up by all of the classic Disney elements. The characters are all overdone, there are lots of songs and there's lots of humour; but the classic yarn about a street urchin happening upon a magic genie lamp remains intact.Critics raved about how well done the characters in Finding Nemo were, but Disney's best characters can be seen in this film. It's amazing how well thought-out they are, and while their motivations are mostly simple - all of the characters behave as you would expect them to do, and it's easy to get carried along with the emotional ride as well as enjoying all the songs and stuff. Speaking of the songs - they definitely give the movie most of it's highlights. I'm not a fan of musicals, but the songs here are extremely catchy and the images put in with them make the film memorable. I hadn't seen this flick for around eight years, but I still knew what was coming in most scenes just because the movie is so memorable. Of all the classic yarns, Aladdin is definitely one of; if not the, best as it has everything; lust for power, rags to riches, a romance, magic and more. The way that it's told will mean that younger children will enjoy it without bothering with the story, while the themes carry Aladdin through into a movie that can be enjoyed by older kids and adults. As mentioned, I don't like Disney much; but I make an exception for this film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

You ain't never had a friend like him.,"'Aladdin (1992)' is enhanced greatly by the presence of Robin Williams, who brings his big blue character to life with charming gusto. Though the genie is always entertaining to watch, he isn't the only enjoyable thing about the affair. In fact, it's generally quite a bit of fun. It has several likeable characters, an effectively dastardly villain and a decent message, to boot. It also has one of the strongest soundtracks in Disney's repertoire. It's a great animated affair that deserves to be remembered as fondly as it is. It puts its remake to shame. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Overestimated,"And here we come to the second worst Disney film, only topped by 'the little mermaid'. The music is fine. Disney, you know? But the animation cannot be actually be called beautiful or the like, and the story is hasty and has no substance, the villain a stereotype, and the ending, as the whole story, predictable.I guess the only good thing is the genie, and Iago and the flying carpet perhaps. You see, the minor characters are to a certain degree funny and amiable, if you can call genie a minor character, but Aladdin, Jasmin and Jafar are shallow and kind of boring.Therefore four out of ten stars (quite clement), paying tribute to genie and the music.",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
"One of my favorite films, and I'm not any sort of Disney enthusiast","Aladdin the street urchin (voiced by Scott Weinger) finds a magical lamp that unleashes the power of the blue Genie (voiced by Robin Williams) who grants him three wishes. Unfortunately the evil Jafar plans on using the genie to his own will and wreaks havoc on Aladdin's newly-found life (he wishes to become a sultan in the hopes of earning the love of his life, Princess Jasmine).This is simply a wonderful story with bold animation and a truly terrific vocal performance by Robin Williams. It's the movie's adult humor -- such as the Ah-nuld and Woody Allen impersonations done by Williams -- that make it equally enjoyable for all ages. When this was released in 1992 I was fascinated and used to watch it all the time; now, as an adult, I still enjoy the film for many different reasons, while still managing to appreciate the utter joy of the story.Yes, it's a bit politically correct with Princess Jasmine's strong will against her father and the representation of certain ""careful stereotypes"" (Disney is careful not to come across as racist and in the process cast Americans to do the voices!) but I like it this way. Without Williams the film would be a total bore, to be honest. With him, it's one of the greatest films ever made, which is something I thought I'd never write.5/5",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
"One of my childhood favourites, and still impressive now!","This was one of many Disney flicks that I watched as a kid in the '90s, but I watched it more than most of the others (if not all of them). From what I remember, I enjoyed every Disney animated feature I saw in those days to a certain extent (with the exception of ""Pocahontas""), but for a while, I was pretty much obsessed (I don't know whether that's too strong a word or not) with ""Aladdin""! Since rediscovering animated family films about a year ago, I have seen ""Aladdin"" again twice, and have found that it's still very enjoyable!Aladdin is a street urchin in the city of Agrabah, who has to steal food in order to eat. His only friend is a monkey named Abu. However, his life is about to change. Jafar, the secretly evil grand vizier of the good Sultan, wants to get the lamp from the Cave of Wonders, so he can get the power he longs for! The vizier learns that the only one who can get this lamp from the cave is the ""Diamond in the Rough,"" which he discovers is Aladdin! Meanwhile, Princess Jasmine, the Sultan's daughter, is tired of being pressured by her father to marry, so she runs away in disguise, and goes to the marketplace, where Aladdin sees her and quickly falls in love. These two factors are about to lead Aladdin on a life-changing adventure, where he has a lot to learn!There are several things that make ""Aladdin"" memorable. One of these things is the amazing animation, probably some of the best I've ever seen! The movie also has a memorable bunch of songs, starting with ""Arabian Nights"" at the beginning, followed by the likes of ""One Jump Ahead"", ""Friend Like Me"", ""Prince Ali"", and the Oscar-winning ""A Whole New World"". We certainly can't forget the humour, starting during the opening scene, with the merchant who introduces the story, followed by so many other funny (sometimes hilarious) scenes, sometimes slapstick (like in the ""One Jump Ahead"" sequence). The Genie, voiced by comedian Robin Williams, is a huge part of the humour, acting like a maniac and doing many impressions! Iago, voiced by Gilbert Gottfried, another comedian, is also notable. Aside from all that, ""Aladdin"" is an excellent adventure overall! In brief, this is one memorable film for animation fans of all ages!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Las Agrabah,"With Beauty and the Beast receiving a best picture Oscar nomination, Disney's appeal was at a high and they were eager to build on their acclaim. Aladdin was the perfect film for this and took a very different approach for the studio, but they didn't forget what had made the previous few films so successful. It took an old-fashioned, solidly set-up story and gave it a much more modern feel with broader humour. You'd think that this would clash, yet it works brilliantly and gives the film a unique edge. It's a fine balancing act and I'm not sure many other Disney films could have carried it off, but this is one where nearly everything tried works no matter how madcap it may be.The film focuses on street urchin Aladdin and the princess Jasmine, both being fed-up with their lives and wishing for something else. After a chance meeting with the princess, Aladdin is roped into finding a lamp for sorcerer Jafar only to keep it and unleash a Genie that gives him three wishes which he uses to try to win over Jasmine. At its core it's a story about two people wanting different things and connecting because of that, just with a lot of comedy and many obstacles put in their way. It's nothing complicated, yet it's a storyline that people can easily get behind and they want to see the arc that both people go through. The romance takes up most of it, but enough time is given to develop Jafar and even the Genie's own dilemma.Aladdin and Jasmine aren't the most interesting characters, but they are very likable and as a result always keep your interest. Aladdin is street smart and Jasmine is adventurous, but both are very warm and easy to like individuals. The Genie is what most people remember and he kind of is the star here. Most of that is down to Robin Williams, whose witty improvisations and mile-a-minute comedic stylings are just brilliant here. Genie is just such a fun character as a result, with a numerous jokes of all kinds and he makes pop culture references that are genuinely funny. The Sultan is enjoyably absent-minded, while the characters that don't talk like Aladdin's monkey Abu and the Magic Carpet do provide some funny moments.Another positive is the villain and Jafar is just fantastic. His menacing design looks great, he manages the difficult task of being sinister whilst also having subtle comedic moments and Jonathan Freeman's eloquently dark voice works to perfection. Not only that but his motivations make sense and his grudge towards Aladdin is set-up excellently. Gilbert Gottfried as his Parrott Iago also offers some good laughs. The animation is truly outstanding. I picture a lot of beautiful reds and golds when I think of this film, it is always very visually appealing and the landscape designs just look lovely. The animation on the Genie is very impressive just by how fast it is and a lot of the movements here flow well despite the rapid speed most of it goes at. It also lends itself to some very effective tense moments, I think the climax in general is superb.The music is very good. All the songs here have very catchy melodies and are memorable, from the serene 'A Whole New World' to the energetic 'Friend Like Me'. None of them get in the way of story and the work well with the animation. The romance impressed me as well because there was a believable bond between Aladdin and Jasmine, they do have chemistry and you do get drawn into their struggle. There are some clichés hanging over some areas, but I don't think they affect things too much. As said the comedy is very modern and filled with pop culture references. Some people might fine this distracting, but like I said I think it gives a different twist on the formula.On the whole I'm a big fan of Aladdin. The ways and means by which they tell this story are very out of the box, but I think that is a big part of its appeal. This is a fresh take on a story that could have been quite dull and as a result is does place it aside as something very different for the studio. As said I really liked the main characters, I thought Jafar was an excellent villain and Robin Williams is simply a whirlwind of comedy. The animation is as impressive as ever and I don't think there is a song here that isn't at least good. I'd have to say that this is easily one of Disney's most entertaining pieces.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

A very popular disney-classic,"**As usual tons of spelling mistakes**This is a high-listed disney of mine. It is a very wellmade and entertaining version of the tale of Aladdin.

Suprise me again. If you liked ''Aladdin'' as a disney-film keep away from the two sequels ''Return of Jafar'' and ''Aladdin and the fourty thieves'' (might be the wrong title, in that case all bad on me) made for video.

Very good...but Jasmine?,"Everybody seems to love Disney's ""Aladdin""...and it is a wonderful film. However, one aspect of it bothered me long ago and still does....Jasmine. Think about it for a moment. Her people are poor, hungry and being oppressed. However, at the same time, she's living in complete luxury...nearly all of her wishes being granted. However, despite that, she wants to run around Baghdad pretending she's poor and hanging out the 'little people'! Doesn't this sound a bit like Queen Marie Antoinette? Such a selfish and annoying girl...in an otherwise enjoyable Disney cartoon. This and Aladdin's propensity to lie, lie, lie make it a film that is problematic and I just didn't enjoy it as much as many viewers. Still, it is worth seeing...with lovely animation and catchy songs....despite an annoying Disney princess.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Stay true to yourself!,"Because everyone has different backgrounds and traditions, life is more exciting than it would be if we were all the same. Aladdin was willing to present himself as a king in order to captivate Princess Jasmine. To keep up his facade, he had to keep on lying, which made him fall farther in a hole. Princess Jasmine simply wanted to be with someone true and who didn't demand anything from her, so he was hesitant to admit the truth until it was revealed unexpectedly. It would have been better if the truth had come from him since once trust has been betrayed, it can be challenging to recover it. Thankfully, he was able to win her back.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

A Magical Carpet Ride Through Time: Revisiting Aladdin (1992),"Aladdin, the 1992 Disney animated classic, remains a delightful and enchanting adventure that has stood the test of time. This vivid and colorful masterpiece transports viewers to the mythical city of Agrabah, where we embark on an unforgettable journey alongside the lovable street urchin, Aladdin.From the very beginning, the film captivates its audience with breathtaking animation and an immersive world that feels truly magical. The vibrant colors and intricate details of Agrabah are nothing short of awe-inspiring, creating an atmosphere that rivals even the most imaginative of fairy tales.One of the film's most unforgettable aspects is its remarkable cast of characters. Aladdin, with his heart of gold and unyielding determination, is a relatable protagonist whose dreams and aspirations resonate with viewers of all ages. Meanwhile, Jasmine, the fiercely independent and strong-willed princess, breaks away from the stereotypical damsel in distress, offering a refreshing and empowering female character.However, it is the Genie, brilliantly voiced by the late Robin Williams, who steals the show. His boundless energy, rapid-fire wit, and unparalleled comedic timing inject the film with a dose of humor and heart that is simply unparalleled. The Genie's presence elevates Aladdin to a whole new level, solidifying the film's status as a timeless classic.The music in Aladdin, composed by the legendary Alan Menken, features some of Disney's most iconic and memorable tunes. Songs like ""A Whole New World,"" ""Friend Like Me,"" and ""One Jump Ahead"" are not only catchy and entertaining but also serve to further develop the characters and drive the story forward.The story itself, a tale of love, adventure, and self-discovery, is filled with valuable life lessons and important themes that remain relevant today. Aladdin teaches us the importance of being true to oneself, the power of friendship, and that love transcends societal boundaries and expectations.In conclusion, Aladdin (1992) is a magical, enchanting, and heartwarming film that continues to delight audiences more than three decades after its release. With its remarkable animation, memorable characters, and iconic soundtrack, this Disney classic is a true testament to the power of storytelling and the enduring appeal of a tale as old as time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Last Great Disney,"Aladdin was in my opinion one of the last Disney's great adventures, the last being The Lion KIng......... after that it all went downhill. The stories stopped being interesting, the music became average. To me, it seems like that magical something these animated movies used to have, simply disappeared. But Aladdin puled it off............ the story, although changed a bit, was still entertaining and the music made sense. Aladdin was likable, nice and funny, and the evil Jaffar was a classic villain we expect to find in a story like this. I've seen this movie a thousand times. When it came out I was about 13. My parents bought the tape and my brother, sister and I watched it almost every other day .... it was fun then .... sometimes you realize that things you liked so mush when you were a kid are not as good when you grow up, but Aladdin still is :)",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
magic carpets and genie shenanigans,"Aladdin is basically every underdog's dream-going from street rat to living in a palace. You can't help but root for him. The whole magic lamp thing with Genie granting wishes? Total fantasy goals. And let's be real, Robin Williams as Genie steals the show. His voice acting makes the character hilarious, unpredictable, and full of heart. Genie's over-the-top, shape-shifting antics keep the energy up throughout the movie.The whole ""A Whole New World"" scene with Jasmine on the flying carpet is pure magic. It's one of those moments that gives you chills, especially with the stunning visuals of them soaring over Agrabah. The movie also gives you a solid message-it's not about where you come from but who you are as a person that matters. Aladdin might start off poor, but he's got the heart of gold, and that's what wins him Jasmine in the end. Classic underdog story with epic tunes that still hit even today.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

"Good work, though it is starting to look dated.","I hadn't seen this one in some 4 or 5 years and decided to revisit it... Unfortunately it doesn't hold up well over time, as a lot of the ""pop culture"" references are already outdated.  (Remember when Arsenio had his own show? Remember when Jack Nicholson was thin?) A lot of Genie's impressions of Golden Age actors and TV stars, and even the more recent ones, are showing their age and will probably be wholly obsolete within another 10 or 15 years.  As I watched this movie again I found that the funniest moments were those that didn't exploit the ""present day"" to get their point across.   Iago saying ""NOT!""?.. Ugh.  Does that smack of the early 90s or what?   (Very unpleasantly reminiscent of Little John's ""That's a Gas!"" in Robin Hood..) This will not be one of those timeless movies your grandkids will like 30 years from now, and that's a shame because they could have made it funny *without* branding it with ""1992"".  .. Still, it's enjoyable for a romp nowadays, especially among young adults who actually *remember* when ""Not"" was the height of fashion. (And, by the way, it wouldn't surprise me a bit if the Disney suits decided to just edit that out in future releases of this film...) It's a very colorful movie, too, action packed and almost neon-bright, with CGI that's obvious and glaring and even *more* fun for the people old enough to remember when CGI first came on the scene in animated films.. And later when everybody was so excited about the Ballroom Scene in Beauty and the Beast?  And then everybody started using CGI everywhere and they didn't even bother to blend it in with the rest of the movie because people were so excited about it that they didn't care that it looked obvious?  Remember that?   Yeah, it was right around 1992, wasn't it..?The animation in 'Aladdin' is nice, but it's another one of those examples of how much LESS energy is put into Disney's yearly releases, as compared to earlier films like Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, etc.. Even in 'The Jungle Book' and '101 Dalmatians', both of which are handpainted and ""sketchy-looking"", you can see the difference in quality without even trying.  Hands down, they just took the time to put in more drawings per second, to yield much smoother action.  Some moments in Aladdin look positively cartoony...With Genie especially, the drawings sometimes get a little too loose for comfort.Some saving graces in 'Aladdin,' though, are the songs and the delightful Magic Carpet, who manages to be funny and quirky-cute without saying a word... (Mercifully so, as the writers would probably have him yakking more damning but wannabe-funny '92isms if only he had a mouth.  ""Carpet's in the HOUSE, Yo!  On the floor!""  Ugh.  (Shudders.)  Carpet is a curious character to find in a movie like ""Aladdin,"" exactly because his charming mannerisms are a relaxed and timeless joy amid the frantic pace and pop-reliant humor of the rest of the film.   I'd wager that, in the future, he and Abu will garner more of the adoration as Genie's shtick starts to go gray.  And please.. PLEASE!!  No more Jim Cummings!!  Please make it stop!",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

The story is good, Robin Williams is outstanding, Pixar blew me away with the back drop, and the supporting cast Disney until after this movie was famous for rocked. Abu and carpet were predictably better written for than the main cast, and Gilbert was made to play Iago. The movies only downfall that I can think of was its love song - the typical Disneyesque cheese "" A Whole new World"". It takes a bottle of Drano and a toilet brush to get that song out of your head. A true animated classic to show your kids and grandkids. Too bad Disney thought 3 outstanding movies (Mermaid, Beauty and Beast, and Aladdin) were enough and started dealing out the slop it is known for today (at least until Pizar came along and stole the show).",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Aladdin!,"Watched this Disney's optimal animation in its BluRay form, a stock-in-trade family crowd- pleaser which has been engineered with an impeccable technique and what's more impressive, it oozes an unceasing force of genuineness to edify both children and adults, no condescending doctrine nor feckless naivety, and Robin Williams' voice-performance as the Genie is a great bonus and plays a big part in the film's classic status among its genre.To enumerate Genie's potpourri of imitations alone could be cogent enough to showcase the finesse both for the animators and the voice cast, Robin Williams is deadly hilarious, the motormouthed omnipotent servant, massively steals the thunder from everyone else. But it is not a pejorative remark to other players, on the contrary, it has the most effervescent ensemble including a usually trite class-defying mutual attraction between a princess with a lower-status prince charming. Jafar and Iago pair is another hoot apart from Genie, laughters galore!The plot line entwines pretty much in Disney's safe pattern, a romantic encounter, an abrupt departure, a reunion under the pretense as a legitimate suitor, fighting the evil enemy and happy forever ending, while it really pushes Aladdin to the edge of the cliff since Jafar's invincibility seems to be unbreakable, and the eleventh hour turnover is nothing less than a satisfactory one.2D animation surely has been largely outcast from the lucrative market, but one can never ascertain there will be a wave of coming back in some years ahead, like Black and White films, their unique aestheticism is the wellspring of their vitality, after watching ALADDIN, it perfectly suffices to originate great mojo of satisfaction for an adult first-time viewer, so the last rites seem to be unnecessary, but a niche market-planning should be conducted for the sake of the laborious craftsmanship.The film currently sits at No.2 at my top 10 film of 1992, and Williams earns him a fifth slot in the supporting actor race, the one and only voice-performance on my own Oscar list!",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
How the genie got out the bottle...,"A great typical family-oriented Disney feature gets a lift by giving Robin Williams pretty much the run of the place as a genie with a) an attitude and b) a gift for improv. So you get all the expected heart-warming romantic stuff and exciting chases and surprising intrigues but with that soupçon of the unexpected and, deal with it, belly laughs to boot. At a stroke, it broke the mould for countless Disney / Pixar films to come which appealed as much to kids as to adults, by catering to the would-be adults in all the kids and of course the universal kids in all the adults. If I was being critical, perhaps the background-settings could have wowed me a bit more, especially with the fabulous source-material and the vocal characterisation of the evil Jafar a bit more strongly delineated bu I'm probably nit-picking. As someone whose first book was the ""Arabian Nights"" at age 5, and whose only experience of the Aladdin story since has been mostly in local pantomimes down the years, it was great to see Disney's modern but traditional take on the story. The songs are good too, skilfully worded and not over-populous. Interesting to conjecture about the fact that this Hollywood production from 1992 was made at the time of the U.S. involvement in the first Gulf War plus I like the way it, if gently, challenges the notion of female roles in Arabian society, sadly still a topical subject almost 20 years on. Very funny, mildly subversive entertainment you can take your kids to - now that is a rarity in modern cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
The Robin Williams show!,"This movie is completely held up by Robin William's performance, I think it was the start of the decline of Disney in the 90's that lead to a somewhat lackluster early 2000's Disney but it still has those classic moments that really make it stand above the rest. No need for the remake because this still holds up just fine among the best along with ""Lion King"" and ""Beauty and the Beast""

a magic carpet ride (someone had to say it),"As the mom of 3 rapidly growing kids, I have probably seen every Disney movie out there.Of the ""new"" (beginning with ""The Little Mermaid"")crop, this is easily one of the best.Most of the reviews I've seen have praised Robin Williams as the greatest thing about this movie, and, yes, he was wonderful,but don't overlook the smaller characters,the more subtle touches.One of my personal favorite characters was the carpet. The anthropomorphic artistry was a joy! Finally, the eye was kept forever occupied by the constant shifting of scenes between indigo blue and red/gold.I wa personally kept quite happy by that alone! As an aside, this is the only thing I have ever been able to stomach Gilbert Gottfried in, and he is actually very funny as Iago!The songs were mostly catchy and effective, with clever lyrics...I wonder if any uncredited input could be given to Robin Williams.All in all, I'd have to say I still prefer ""The Little Mermaid"" for msic,choreography, and being the first of the new wave....Then, possibly ""Mulan"" for characters, and Eddie Murphy, who just cracks me up as ""Mushu"". A nod, also, to ""The Emperor's New Groove"" which, while giving the impression of having been put together from stuff left on the cutting-room floor manages to be the freshest thing the Disney studios have put out in years.

"Wonderful,unforgettable Disney film!!!!! A must see, over and over again!!!!","Well, this movie is so fantastic with all the amazing cast of people that play the characters!!! I loved the movie because of the humor,wit, fun, adventure, magic, and romance in it. I loved this movie since I was little and it's a Disney Classic. You can't help but see the movie over and over again! It's irresistible! I adore Aladdin and Jasmine this is truly one of the best Disney films ever. If you get the DVD, you'll get bonus features of how they made the movie and the behind-the-scenes of some of the songs. The song,""A Whole New World"", is the highlight of this special film when Aladdin starts singing to Jasmine how he could take her to a whole new world as they ride the magic carpet at night throughout the land!!!

Aladdin,"Enjoyable Disney classic. Overall I was pretty entertained by this movie. But it didn't live up to my expectations as much as I'd liked. I think compared to other Disney movies it lacks some of that heart and emotion, and goes too ''meta'' for my tastes.First off visually it looks great, not the best Disney animation I've seen in terms of visuals but it looks the part when it needs to. Directing is great too. Animation feels like it lacks just a tad behind in parts where I feel like they skipped over the details a tiny bit too fast, mostly during action scenes. Characters are good, run of the mill mostly with the Genie being the standout of them all. Voice acting is top notch as well for all, standout again being the genie with Williams, how can it not be. Jafar is fine, not nearly as memorable though.Story was okay, but the villain solution and the quick wrap up felt a bit hasty to me. Though overall the movie moves at a good pace.That said with so much praise for the Genie I do also think it's a slight flaw in the movie to make him so ''meta'' with his jokes. I'm conflicted because I love the creativity but it takes you out of the immersion of that world. Like the joke where he puts Aladin ''in frame'' with his hands, a joke only knowable if you have cameras. Which are obviously not yet invented in Aladdin's world. Little things I guess. There's a lot of things for the viewer, not the character.Also had a very different idea of how this movie would start. It as surprising to see them break 4th immediately with a ''storyteller'' type character. This feels better fit in a movie that has multiple chapters though. As we never see the storyteller again.Music is really nice, though aside from the Genie's song and A Whole New World the other ones are a bit more forgettable. Genie's tune will stick in your mind forever. But the song in general was just fine. For me this movie lacked that ''one'' soundtrack that elevates the whole movie. That being said, the writing for the songs is good and nice and dynamic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
One of my favorites!,"Aladdin is a superb Disney movie. I found the story to be interesting, if somewhat hectic at times. The characters had personality, they were funny, they had CHARACTER. Robin Williams does an amazing job as Genie. The music is my favorite part of the movie, though. When I heard ""One Jump Ahead"", I loved it. When I heard ""Prince Ali"", I loved it. And then when ""A Whole New World"" came along, I was like, ""oh my god"". It is an amazing song. If I were to knock any points off it would be for the animation, which doesn't seem on par with Disney quality at times. But other than that, this is one of the best Disney movies ever released. It is much better than any of the new stuff Disney is releasing (Brother Bear, Home on the Range), and I would say it is even with Beauty and the Beast and Hercules. So overall, I would give Aladdin 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Close but no Hookah,"Aladdin, while one of Disney's best isn't exactly one of the classics and while definitely an entertaining film, I feel that something is missing. Audio-visually it's top-notch material. Everything looks gorgeous, with beautiful designed & colored environments, great character design and animation, (although inferior to Beauty and the Beast which came one year later), and CG that doesn't look out of place. Voice acting is pretty good and the music breaks, a part that I usually hate about Disney, are surprisingly good, blending some good tunes with some pretty funny scenes.The classic middle-eastern tale about the wish-granting genie gets a modern facelift and with some great characters thrown into the mix. Jafar is one of Disney's best villains, similar to Scar from The Lion King and the naive Sultan is quite likable. The main couple though could be better. They have some good points of course, like their chemistry, Aladdin's genuinely good character and street-wise wit and Jasmine's strong will and –again- genuine charm. The cons? A somewhat bland romance and their sudden turn from a wise-ass hero and a charming princess to a surfer dude teen and a typical damsel in distress.The main deal of course is the Genie, which steals the show and for a good reason. R. Williams obnoxiously over-the-top performance fits like a glove to the hyper-lively and wacky character of the Genie who, in my opinion gives what's best about this film. Forget about the romance or Jafar's schemes, Aladdin's finest aspect is its comedy. But is it truly funny? Yes and no. When the Genie isn't around humor is scarce and subtle and when it IS around, while the undoubtedly a funny character, it makes too many modern-day references for the jokes to stand the test of time.The defining factor for me though is that Aladdin will excite people, (no matter the age), only once in the first viewing. It's one of those films which get less fun to watch as time goes by. The romance is good but forgettable, the villain is great but his power struggle doesn't contain any mystery or plot twists, the action is passable and the comedy while way above average isn't even close to being perfect. All in all a great film for renting, but not something worth buying.FINAL VERDICT: Amongst the Disney's greats not its bests (7/10)",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Awesome Movie,It is probably one of the best Disney movies I've seen. Aladdin is one of my favorite movies of all time actually. I can relate a little to Aladdin in that I've liked guys that have been out of reach and just wished to be someone Im not just to be with them. It has teaches you that you don't have to be someone or something that you are not to have others like you. I love Genie though the most. That might also be cause I'm a huge Robin Williams fan. The characters are awesome and developed well by the creators of each one. I will say though and as retarded as this may sound. When I was younger I had a crush on Aladdin. I know he's a cartoon but I was a little girl. I didn't care. The movie is cute and funny and an over great film that the whole family will enjoy. It is a movie for everyone all ages and size.,8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
"Enjoyable enough, though not a true Disney classic","I revisited this film as an adult, having watched as a child but forgotten how it went. That made sense as I rewatched, it's a pleasant film to watch, with a simple enough plot, and the genie definitely is largely responsible for that.Its short, and as a result does the job of a nice easy watch. I would say also it hasn't aged incredibly well from 1992, e.g. pretty superficial and can see why it can give a damaging message to children on body image and status and what not.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

"Just really, really good","If you have any tolerance at all for these animated Disney musicals, this one is sure to be a hit. The plot is good, develops throughout, and manages to be accessible to kids, whilst not talking down to adults. The humor has moments for both groups, as well, entertaining those with two digits in their age with pop culture references and clever comedy. The characters are well-done, interesting and credible. The voice-work is quite good. None of the actors really do badly. Jafar comes across as smart and menacing. Gilbert Gottfried portrays his part well, and his voice works rather well for Iago. Robin Williams... he's great. Some of the best material in the film is his, and he delivers it impeccably. Beyond reproach. Unless you can't stand him and his act, he's sure to get you laughing. The songs are good, well-performed, meaningful and more often than not, catchy. The pacing is spot-on, throughout. The color scheme is full and the animation, with its mix of 2D and 3D, is a pure joy to behold. The energy, creativity and, yes, even emotion, is impressive. The DVD offers, among other things, two commentary tracks(one for directors/producers and one for animators), and a pop-up trivia track, all of which are worth watching for those interested in such things. I recommend this to any fan of the actors and/or Disney animated features. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
The End of Disney's Golden Years,"Aladdin, a street urchin, accidentally meets Princess Jasmine, who is in the city undercover. They quickly grow to love each other (as happens in movies), but she can only marry a prince.Disney's second golden years were 1989-1992, which were unfortunately quite brief. Of course they had hits before that and after that, but for these few years every film was an instant classic. ""Aladdin"", with its excellent music and the inclusion of Robin Williams, just hit home so hard (and spawned multiple sequels and a television show).How do you critique a film that everyone loves? You simply do not. I guess if I was forced to say anything negative, it would be that Aladdin and Jasmine look a tad too similar and some think they are siblings separated at birth -- and that would not be right. When Aladdin tells a guard that Jasmine is his sister, it seems plausible!One thing about the film is how it has aged in a way that was unexpected. In 1992, terrorism was not what it is today (2016). Although the film is innocent and there is really nothing offensive about it, one wonders if Disney could have made a film about the Middle East with characters who praise Allah in today's climate.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

One of the classics,"""Aladdin"" . . . not only the best movie in the exalted Renaissance period, but also -- along with ""The Jungle Book"" -- Disney's best musical. Seriously, this soundtrack is chock-full of earworms and none of them are filler.Everyone knows what this movie's best feature is (and I'll get to that in a second), but the level of quality in its animation is staggering. The color saturation is purely eye-candy, and it makes Agrabah a memorable Disney kingdom. Even the characters (some of the whitest Arabs ever put to film) have personality in their movements that you just don't expect.These assets by themselves make this a worthwhile movie, but it's Robin Williams who blasts it out of the park. His overstimulated execution leaves an indelible mark on this company's history, and the lion's share of laughs come directly from him. It's a gifted, delightful and energetic performance, and it's easy to lay the movie's vast appeal at his feet.But honestly, the whole thing is wildly entertaining.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

A good Disney film,"I'd heard about this film after seeing Beauty and the Beast, and this, along with that aforementioned film, are my runners-up for my favorite Disney films. The top winners (in my opinion) are Mulan, The Lion King, and Atlantis: The Lost Empire. Not only do we get Robin Williams (in one of his best roles along with Mrs. Doubtfire), Gilbert Gottfried (this movie was the first time I'd heard of him), Scott Weinger (Candace Cameron's TV boyfriend from Full House); we also get voice veterans Jim Cummings (of the many 1990s cartoons) and Frank Welker (G1 Megatron).I did not pay much attention to the Middle East before this film and even though there is some misinformation involved, it's still a somewhat accurate portrayal of the old days in that part of the world. The original Aladdin story took place in Western China (which I later learned has a large Muslim population) but that didn't hinder my enjoyment of the film.

Freedom,"This is one of the films that I have liked since I was a child. Recently, I watched the play ""Aladdin"" by Shiki Theatre Company. I like it so much. Aladdin is a poor but honest man. Jasmine is the princess of the country. There is the difference of rank between them, but Aladdin gets the magic lamp and his life changes. With Genie's help, he tries to be a man meets Princess Jasmine. It looks just like a story of love and magic, but I think the backgrounds that the main characters have are remarkable points. Aladdin, Jasmine and Genie are very different, but they have one thing in common. It is the desire for freedom. Aladdin wants to stop his poor life. Jasmine is tired of the castle life and hopes to see the wide world. Genie wants to be free and not to be follow his master anymore.

Aladdin,"I feel lucky to count myself among those who grew up watching modern masterpieces such as ""Aladdin"", ""The Little Mermaid"", ""Beauty and the Beast"" and the like. Nowadays they just don't make 'em like that anymore. Sad but true. (I'm not keen on the Pixar flicks, sorry). I vividly remember going to see each and one of them (starting with ""Mermaid"" in the spring of 1990) on the big screen. Those were scarce moments of true childhood innocence. Times that you take with you forever, and Disney has done just that to almost every kid in the world during the last 70 years. ""Aladdin"" came out at the peak of Disney's third golden age that started in 1989. The company released a number of films which broke new ground in animation and were huge artistic and commercial successes as well. Although it broke a few records when it came out on video in 1993, for some odd reason, this DVD release sold a meager amount of copies, catching everyone at the studio by surprise.

A Whole New World! Beautiful and unique from every angle!,"Nothing on earth could ever compete against this enormous Disney blockbuster. The animation is outstanding, not only are the hand-drawn cartoons rich and detailed with the use of very striking colours but the CGI is incredible as well. The way the Beast has been created that guards the Cave of Wonders looks so real and sinister that it transported me into an entirely different world just sitting in my bedroom and watching it on the telly. It's surprising that it was never shown at IMAX cinemas, but then again, this was 1992 and I shouldn't think IMAX was around then. There is not a single sign of boredom, silliness, cruelty or any other bad points in a film, it's fantastic all over. The characters and the natures of the characters were very well considered and put into deep thought. Aladdin is a carefree young man who is poor and homeless who seems happy and perhaps the sort of boy who is up-to-no-good sometimes but deep down there is a feeling of insecurity and we are able to see how sad he really is. Jasmine has an incredibly strong mind (for a Disney Princess at least) and loses her temper quite easily but deep down she is sick and tired of having her ""life lived for her"" and with these two things, she is charming and rather funny. Jafar is quite different to ordinary Disney villains who'd normally yell ""I'll get you yet! Ha-ha-ha!"" He's dark and mysterious and witty with it, looking at him he looks like he's psychologically poorly when he plots evil schemes and people like that need medical help not being banged up in jail for god's sake! Think how hard it must be for them! I'm sure he's insecure too, at heart. The Genie has got to be the funniest supporting character Disney has ever come up with. Robin Williams, I have to say, was the perfect choice for this bundle of giant, hilarious fun. The Genie looked as if he'd gone a bit off his rocker in some scenes - but that's all the better. Irritating Aladdin, in one or two sequences, had me in hysterics, dressing up as pretty ladies and funny-looking men was side-splitting comedy and there are lots more gags from the Genie that'll always leave me giggling after the film. The Sultan is a rather eccentric, gullible character who tries to find Jasmine her perfect match but doesn't seem to be doing very well as she gets it clear to him that she wants to make her own choice of man, and he also, is very funny, especially when he pinches Aladdin's cheek and a slobbery kind of sound comes from out his mouth. The storyline is very interesting. A golden lamp is hidden in a mysterious cave but only one person may make their entrance and Jafar, to his dismay, is not that person. Who could it be? You guessed it! It's Aladdin! Jasmine escapes her Arabian palace so that she can lead her own life and then accidentally bumps into Aladdin, the man she truly loves. The palace guards arrest Aladdin and Jafar lies to a heartbroken Jasmine that he thought that the street-boy captured her against her will and he has already been put to death. Jafar dresses as an old beggar and takes Aladdin to the cave and promises him a grand reward if he fetched the magic lamp. Aladdin soon becomes trapped in the cave and now he has the chance to find out what is so special about this old, dented lamp - a big genie with a massive personality will answer that question! But despite the fact that his plan has failed Jafar is not going to give up getting his hands on the lamp! Soon enough Aladdin is powerless to put constant stops to Jafar's schemes. If ""Fantasia"" took you on a breathtaking adventure then you really ought to soar away from the normal world with this incredible film-experience. This is just too good to miss! Take it from me, you'll love it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Timeless,"It's been nearly fifteen years since the theatrical release of ""Aladdin,"" and every time I watch it I am transported back in time to when I first saw it in theaters as a child.""Aladdin"" is a magical film; wondrous, exhilarating, and beautiful. While it may not be the BEST Disney film (that goes to its predecessor, ""Beauty and the Beast""), it's the most fun.The story is loosely based on the ""Aladdin and the King of Thieves"" tale (or so I'm told). I'm not that familiar with the source material, but the movie begins with Aladdin, a street beggar who finds a magic lamp and becomes a prince. Complications ensue when the sultan's adviser, Jafar, tries to get it too, and Aladdin has to deal with mounting pressure and guilt from the fact that his princehood isn't real (which is a problem since the princess can only marry a prince).Anyone who talks about this film is bound to bring up Robin Williams sooner or later, and rightly so. Williams dominates this movie, and it shows. The genie is the most entertaining character to watch, as it's paired with William's boundless energy and nonstop imitations (that change in a flash). Williams elevates ""Aladdin"" from great to absolutely brilliant, and nonstop entertaining.Fortunately, the rest of the movie matches up to William's performance just about evenly. The rest of the voice-overs are great. Scott Weinger is perfect as Aladdin, making it easy to sympathize with Aladdin. Brad Kane's singing voice is almost indistinguishable from Weinger's, which is in and of itself impressive. Linda Larkin/Lea Salonga are great as Jasmine, as is the rest of the cast, which includes Gilbert Gottfried as the sarcastic, wisecracking parrot Iago (who, interestingly enough, is elevated to more than just the villain's sidekick).While I'm on the subject of the voices, I have to bring to light another member of the voice cast. That is Jonathan Freeman. He is tremendously talented, and creates the most vile villain ever to grace a Disney film; so much so that the likes of Ursula, Gaston, Hades and, ugh, Radcliffe, all pale to the likes of Jafar.

Aladdin,"Certainly one of the better animations from the reinvigorated 1990's Disney Studio. It still has the schmaltzy, over sentimental treatment that seems to torment me every time I watch a Disney film, but the characterisations of the ""Genie"" (Robin Williams"") and the evil ""Jafar"" (Jonathan Freeman) are great as are the rest of the vocal acting talent (rather than using established stars). The script is punchy, well written and has plenty for folks of all ages to engage with. The songs are well paced and amusing and nowhere near as shouty as we have become used to in later animations. All in all this sits well as en enjoyable take on an an enjoyable Arabian Nights style story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Robin Williams made this worth watching,"I'm sorry, but I never took interest in why people would care for Aladdin or Jasmine when all along it was Robin Williams as the genie that gave the movie it's heart and soul. Most people and critics alike had applauded the film for being more of a Robin William's movie than caring for the other characters.The title character (Aladdin) is a street thief with his trusted monkey Abu (voice of Frank Welker) in which the thief must do what he can to survive until he meets a woman who's about to be punish before saving her. What he realizes is that the woman he saved (Jasmine) is a princess in which she must only marry a prince and not some peasant off the streets until Aladdin embarks on a journey with a prisoner of hidden treasures before finding a magic lamp with one insane genie (Robin Williams). Just like any other movie with a genie in a lamp, it's all about the three wishes in which one of them grants Aladdin the wish to be a prince to woo Jasmine.To me, it's all about Robin Williams and his impersonation of everybody to Groucho Marx, Arsenio Hall, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), and anybody you can think of that saves this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
"A very fun film, better for older people!","I do not want to insult anybody or let anybody take this statement in the wrong light, but: I think this film is a great deal better for people aged 12 and over. Why? Because I think that there is so much ""adult"" humour to be enjoyed in this film that little children do not need to watch it. But I am not saying they should not! Little children will like the characters, the adventures and the songs, which is perfectly hunky dory, but they will miss the humour, which is perhaps the best part of this film. The humour is provided mainly by Robin Williams who voices the genie and Gilbert Gottfried, who voices Iago the parrot.In this very good animated Disney film, we meet Jafar, the Sultan's evil adviser, who is trying to find a magic lamp, with a genie which will make him Sultan. We also meet Aladdin, a street rat, with no money and stealing everything he needs. We meet Jasmine, princess Jasmine, who does not want to marry any of the suitors her father, the Sultan, is offering her to marry. Soon enough, an adventure will begin between these characters - and more...I recommend this to anyone who has a sense of humour and to anyone who likes Disney films. I will say this: Anyone of any age can watch this film, but people who understand more grown-up humour will enjoy this more. Enjoy ""Aladdin""! :-)",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Splendid Disney Film To Watch,This is an absolutely tremendous Disney film for all viewers to watch and really enjoy. I enjoyed watching it. The storyline was great and strong. The cast selection was good. They connected to the storyline and to their respective characters. Robin Williams will never be replaced as the genie. He was a fabulous selection for the role of the character. This film and storyline has so much history and story in it. This story is one of the many stories that will never cease to exist.

Great film!,"Quick......what was Aladdin's true name? Answer: Either ""Genie or Genie does,"" depending on where he was.Most of you probably know that but I didn't, probably because I hadn't watched this movie since it came out in 1992 with Robin Williams! I was a little kid, and never did see this again on TV or VHS. I only saw it again because several high-definition DVD websites said this looked spectacular on Blu-Ray.Aladdin is the perfect film with Robin Williams as the Genie! How right they were; this looks incredible! I cannot believe how fantastic the artwork is, and sharp the picture comes through on this restored high-def disc. The colors and the amount of details in all the art are astounding. Many of the scenes had my jaw dropping in admiration. The story, frankly, is not anything that great for a man my age but the visuals are so fantastic that I enjoyed the experience.I also appreciated the 2.55:1 widescreen picture.

The Genie is everything,"This was the only Disney movie I can remember, except perhaps for Snow White, which I loved on first viewing AND had an insatiable desire to watch over and over again. Without the Genie, this would be little better than average. Throw in this collection of blue smoke, along with his lamp, and Robin Williams, and you get a very good film.The inclusion of the Genie makes even the parts without him hold together. Aladdin early on has the attention, and Jafar, as the villain, turns in a creditable performance throughout. The other characters have their moments, but are too reminiscent of other Disney good-guys, even Aladdin sometimes. Disney could at least have made half an effort to be authentic and give all the characters bar the genie Arabian voices, instead of only the bad guys!The genie allowed Disney to be creative, as he has PHENOMENAL COSMIC POWERS and can do anything, including be very funny. Indeed, his effect rubs off both on Aladdin and his monkey/elephant.The climax at the end is well set up, as is the fact that someone else (guess who) gains access to the magic lamp. A very strong point is that Disney managed to give the good guys victory WITHOUT killing off the bad guys (I won't say how for those who haven't seen it).Yep, Disney succeeded with this one: 8/10. Now a word of advice:DON'T WATCH THE SEQUEL!

Great fun!,"I think, of all the Disney movies from the early 90's, ""Aladdin"" is, hands down, the most enjoyable.  It's got the perfect mix of humor, action, and romance.  Most interesting of all, however, is the fact that Disney hasn't ever got this mix right twice.  ""Hercules"" was intended as another ""Aladdin"" and while that's a fun little movie, it's not nearly as memorable as it's predicessor.I think the reason is that, for once, Disney chose to lighten up while making ""Aladdin"".  They allowed the characters to look and act more offbeat than usual.  Visually, the artwork is fantastic and the psychedelic color scheme comes very close to putting ""Yellow Submarine"" to shame.  The memorable characters are another highlight of the movie.  I don't think you'll find a better sidekick than Genie or a more endearing hero than Aladdin himself.Absolute perfection.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Lost its lustre,"There was a time back in the '90s when I thought ""Aladdin"" was the best animated movie of the decade. Now I think time has rendered a different verdict. ""The Lion King"" seems to be the best remembered Disney flick from that time, and is an acknowledged cultural touchstone. People of my generation remember seeing it, typically more than once, in theatres.""Aladdin"", though? I think it's kind of lost its lustre. It often lost me as I tried to sit through it just now. It is enlivened, of course, by the presence of Robin Williams, in one of the most immortal acts of voice acting in history. Gilbert Gottfried as Iago is underrated. I kept trying to place the voice of Jafar - is it Tim Curry? Jeremy Irons? Alan Rickman? Turns out, none of the above: it's an actor called Jonathan Freeman who I'd never heard of.The movie also has some immortal music, like ""The Lion King"", with words by the legendary lyricist Tim Rice, who is best known for collaborating with Andrew Lloyd Webber. ""A Whole New World"" is a truly magical track, up there with ""The Circle of Life"" and ""When You Wish Upon a Star"".I wanted to like ""Aladdin"" more on this rewatch. I haven't seen it since childhood. Maybe it's just that I'm older. I might watch it again later and see if I've changed my mind. If so, I'll update this lukewarm review.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Pure Disney classic,"ALADDIN, in my opinion, is a pure Disney classic. If you ask me, Jafar (voice of Jonathan Freeman) was truly diabolical. On the other hand, Aladdin (voice of Scott Weinger) and Princess Jasmine (voice of Linda Larkin) were truly meant to be together. However, if you ask me, the Genie (voice of Reobin Williams) gave the funniest performance of everyone who acted in the film. I really enjoyed the music, especially ""A Whole New World,"" by Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say everyone involved in this film did very well. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this film that's pure Disney magic to all of you who haven't seen it. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
"Good, but could have been better","""Aladdin"" is surely one of the better animated films out there featuring memorable characters, lush scenery and beautiful animation. But the film is hampered by the genie's excessive ""patter"" (a word used by so many reviewers). The over-the-top genie character distracts from everything else that is working. His stand-up routine is especially now dated and irrelevant to most young viewing audiences and his jokes and antics are not funny but vexing. If the genie was toned down a bit as well as toning down Jafar, especially at the end, then this would have been an excellent film. They should have kept it more grounded and focused on human relationships and class differences. Yes I know there is a flying carpet and magical genie so this is not supposed to be realism, but the film just seemed to get out of control for my tastes. I liked the ""Whole New World"" song and scene, though some of the music did sound like the ""Reading Rainbow"" song to my ear, and the beginning hunt for the lamp seemed heavily dependent on ""Raiders of the Last Ark"" and ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"". So all things considered I rate this film a 6/10, and I've just seen it once as an adult so no nostalgia points from me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

The last true Disney film?,"First of all, I have waited years for the DVD to come out. This is one of my all-time favourite Disney movies, so I was thrilled when it finally arrived. It took a while before I understood why it's one of my favourites, but I think I have nailed it down to a few key points:Drawing and Animation. It's a clean animation. True old-style Disney, in the sense that there are no straight lines. Everything is curved. Also, the thickness of the drawing line varies, which is not often seen these days.Plot and character development. It's cute, and that is what it should be. The most dramatic event in a Disney film should be something like Dumbo not being able to reach his mother because his trunk is too short; I dislike the later movies where characters even die.Sound and music. Many people have mentioned the great voice overs, but I'd like to mention the music. The film is centered around the songs, like the great Broadway musicals. This is pleasing, and what great songs they are! It is without a doubt personal preference, but that is the way I like them. Other Disney favourites include Jungle Book, The Aristocats and Snowwhite, all of which have excellent music.There are some scenes in the movie that might make it less timeless than other Disney films - Genie impersonates some well-known actors and the like. However funny at this point, it might fade a bit when time goes on. However, I still think this is one of the Disney classics. A true one, because the studio would have you believe that all their movies are classics after a few years have passed, which they are not.Recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

All these made it a timeless favorite for audiences of all ages and a classic Disney animated movie.

Overrated and grating to watch,"When I was younger, I loved watching Aladdin as a kid.Now as an adult, I find it unbearable to watch. The biggest turn off is Genie. Now I like Robin Williams as an actor, but Genie is one of the most annoying film characters in existence (in my opinion), he's more grating than Jar Jar Binks of the prequel Star Wars movies. I think that this movie is only popular for being popular, not for its merit. The songs are also irritating to listen. The ""Whole New World"" song makes my skin crawl with the unusually high inflections and pitches of the VA's singing, Jasmine's voice actress has a terrible singing voice.

Disney finds its trendiness,"Don't get me wrong, trendiness and pop culture humor do not a good movie make. In ""Aladdin"", though, it just worked. Robin Williams pulled it off really well.

It wasn't only Robin Williams, though, so don't think that's what I'm saying. The music was also really good. I tried to learn all the songs from the soundtrack, but I never quite got them all. I just love the movie as a whole.My fondest memory of it is when two of my friends and I tried once to act the whole movie out, but we never got past the scene where Aladdin sings ""One Jump Ahead"". I was the shortest, so I always played Iago and Abu. Not even ""Beauty and the Beast"", my favorite Disney movie, has such nostalgic value to me.

He discovers an old lamp and to his surprise, a genie voiced by Robin Williams pops out.  Williams is in rare form as Disney seems to have let him do whatever he wants, which fits since it is a genie who has been bottled up for so long.

Wish granted!,"My Take: The sort of cinematic magic Disney has come to offer.After spawning success with their LITTLE MERMAID, the studio's latest work in many years, Disney proceeded with ALADDIN, which comprises another witty and enjoyable charm drawn from colorful animation, enjoyable characters, swift bits of action and solid bits of comedy. Some of the humor falls flat (lets face it, when the humor doesn't come from Robin Williams' Genie or Gilbert Gottfried as the noisy wisecracking parrot, the humor falls a little flat), but everything else fits so perfectly, and it all clearly shows what kind of success Disney spawns.The first half, where Aladdin (voiced by Scoot Weinger) and his life as a ""worthless street-rat"", falters a bit at times, but it practically catches up in the second half, mostly from the introduction of Williams' manic Genie, who not only fits Williams, but also fits his personalities and manic humor, mostly including nods to Williams' comic impersonations of stars, from Robert DeNiro to Jack Nicholson. If just for Williams, ALADDIN is a true delight for the adult audience. But Williams isn't just the only delight in ALADDIN. Characters of various colors and musical numbers of sheer delight all come together to create a true family movie delight.Directors John Musker and Ron Clements (the magicians behind MERMAID) has brought together this enjoyable affair, complete with appealing characters that would act as a trademark for future Disney enterprises. From a straightforward lead of Aladdin and Princess Jasmine (voiced by Linda Larkin) to the nifty effective villainy of Jaffar (voiced superbly by Jonathan Freeman) and his meddling parrot companion (voiced by Gilbert Gottfried), the film gives us characters we can root for, and characters to be delighted from, good or bad guy. The animation is a true delight, ranging from an active foreground to an elaborate background, ALADDIN delights with sheer colorful brilliance. This is Disney at top form, and what instant classics are made of! Sit back, and enjoy this magic carpet-ride into a wonderful enterprise best be described in three simple words: Shining, shimmering splendid.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
A great film that sums up the career of a great actor,"Not only is Aladdin an incredible stand alone, motion picture, it is also (in my opinion) the greatest performance by an actor we lost too soon. Robin Williams.Williams as the Genie, made the film, the fact that he improvised so much and left over 16 hours (more than a day) worth of recording just show how much he made the character his own and I love it when actors do that. This is one of the few films where I felt that a supporting character left a greater mark on the film, he was just so animated and probably the funniest Disney character of all time. The sentimental moments between Aladdin and Genie also got me tearing up, particularly at the end.The other characters were awesome, I honestly believe that this is the Disney film where the two leads have the most chemistry. They just go together, and the fact they are oblivious to whom the other one is but still fall for each other just shows how well they go together. Also, Jafar!!! By far one of the greatest Disney villains of all time. He was funny, menacing and had a devious voice and the contrast between him and Iago A.K.A. The Gilbert Gottfried bird, just made all the more awesome.The music was good, the three songs ""Friend Like Prince Ali "","" A whole new world and Me"" are all classics, the rest of the songs were unfortunately forgettable.Overall, Aladdin is great fun, emotional and came at a point when Disney was at its strongest (The Disney Renaissance) and, 22 years on, the Disney magic still holds today.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Quite funny at times and has enough substance to keep adults interested too.Some catchy songs too, just to make it memorable.Robin Williams steals the show as voice of the genie.

A Magical adventure for kids.,"Ah, the tale of Aladdin and the genie in the lamp. Believe it or not, I saw Disney's live action adaptation long before this animated classic. And I'm using the term ""classic"" here simply because it is perceived as one, although not by me.'Aladdin' is a wonderful story and there are many life lessons disguised behind a façade of cute characters a young audience will love. They, off course, won't understand the deeper meaning of what is presented here. They will laugh, fall in love with the characters, and have a good time.Our hero, Aladdin, is a young thief with a pet monkey, Abu. Our heroin, Jasmine, is a princess. Interestingly, Aladdin is much happier than Jasmine, even though he owns nothing and doesn't have a place to stay. He is a free spirit. Jasmine on the other hand has all the wealth she can dream of, but she feels trapped and wants to escape from it all.When these two characters meet, it opens the door wide for character development, while the viewer starts searching his soul. There's so much to learn from this bright, colourful, and lively animated movie. The antagonist is Jafar, along with his equally evil parrot Iago. Jafar tricks Aladdin into finding a lamp, which houses a genie that can grant the owner three wishes. Needless to say, Jafar has no good intentions and wants to use the wishes for his personal and selfish gain.The Genie is wonderfully voiced by Robin Williams and by far my favourite character.

Disney Could have given me better,"I just recently watched Aladdin for the first time(I'm 15). For some reason, though we owned many Disney movies, Aladdin was never one of them and I was very excited to watch it. I was thoroughly disappointed. The animation was good, but Jasmine looked like an Arabian stripper. What message does this send to the young girls that watch it? Also, the Sultan exclaims many comments about Allah. So, they'll put in comments about Allah but they won't ever put in anything about God? Robin Williams has always freaked me out, so imagining him as the genie kind of ruined the character. They condoned stealing and sneakiness, but maybe it's just the way I view it. Also, I didn't like that they put in very modern stuff for a very early time. I mean, a Disney vacation for an ancient genie? It made the movie kind of cheesy.

it's all about the genie..,"The early 90s were a great time for Disney with Beauty and the Beast, Lion King, and Aladdin. Of all of these popular Disney movies, Aladdin has the least punch to it. It starts out slow but once Robin Williams shows up as the Genie, it gets kicking. Robin Williams is a tour de force in this feature, basically carrying the whole film. The casting of Williams was genius. Roger Ebert wondered in his review which came first - the drawings or the voice, because Williams improvisational skill is shown off impressively here.The rest of the film is unfortunately predictable. Boy meets girl. boy can't get girl b/c he thinks he isn't good enough. Boy tries to be someone he isn't. boy loses girl. boy saves the girl and wins her back by being himself. Oh and there is a cute sidekick and a mean villain too.For the kids, it's a great movie and they will want to watch it over and over again. Having the genie in it will make it much easier.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Wonderful Film,"As the title says, Aladdin is a wonderful film. It was the first film that I saw in the theater, or at least the first I remember seeing. I loved it then and I love it now. Thirteen years ago, i was amazed by the antics of Abu, Iago, and the Genie. Now, I'm still amazed at how the film appeals to both the children and the parents watching. I grew up with this movie. And, as I grew up, I began to understand the various levels of humor. I don't laugh at things like Iago getting stuck in the door anymore, now I laugh at Robin Williams, and his many personas. It was a ten out of ten then and it's still a ten out of ten now.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Funniest Disney Film of All time!!!!!!!,"This film is the most unique Disney film ever made because of 3 reasons: 1.The first Disney film to take place in the Arabian's desert 2. The first animated film to gross $200,000,000 domestically 3. The comedic styling's of Robin Williams and Gilbert Gottfried. With Aladdin, I expected a completely different film, but being a fan of Robin Willaims, I was not surprised how good it was. I was depressed when they canceled plans on re-releasing the film to Imax like they did with Beauty and the Beast and the Lion king. The film creators found who i think is the best villain actor of all time in Jonathan Freeman(Jafar). Him, Elanor Audley(Lady Tremaine and Maleficent), George Sanders(Shere Khan), Vincent Price(Ratigan), Pat Carroll(Ursula), and Jeremy Irons(Scar) are the best as well.

"Despite the old classics, this really is the best animated Disney movie of all time.","I never get tired of this movie - with is excellent animation, brisk plot and, of course, the genius of Robin Williams in his portrayal of Genie. No other Disney movie even comes close to this combination of childhood fun and adult humor like Aladdin. There are more memorable lines in this movie than I can count - ""Exits are here, here, here, here, everywhere!"" - ""I can't believe it, I'm losing to a rug!"" - and the songs are especially memorable, even for Disney. ""Magic Carpet Ride"" and ""Prince Ali"" will get stuck in your head for weeks after. I can't say enough about Aladdin, except I wish Disney still made movies like this!

A Disney Classic!,"The Disney version of Aladdin is the best one I have ever seen, and in my opinion, Aladdin is the third greatest movie made by the Walt Disney Company. Glen Keane again manages to create a great design for Aladdin, who is very handsome. The voices are great, and Robin Williams does a fantastic job as Genie. The animation, of course using the new CAPS system is wonderful, although I do miss the old Xerography movies. The new ones aren't the same as the coloring is now done by computer, whereas from 101 Dalmatians (1961)up until The Little Mermaid (1989) it was all done by hand. Lea Salonga does a great duet with Brad Kane in the Academy Award winning song 'A Whole New World' which is definitely the best song in the film, closely followed by 'One Jump Ahead (Reprise)' sung beautifully by Brad Kane, who I hope will do more singing for Disney and other company's, apart from the sequels to Aladdin, as I believe he has the most beautiful male singing voice in the world.

Genie steals the show,I have never loved Aladdin as much as everyone else does and to be honest I prefer the live action remake that came out earlies this year but that dosnt mean I don't know how great this movie is. its full of charm likeable characters and fantastic musical numbers. the voice acting is incredible but Robin Williams as the genie totally steals the show he was born for the part and does everything absolutely flawlessly. the movie is very funny and jafar is one of the best Disney villains of all time.

Animation entertainment perfected,"Aladdin has a long and illustrious legacy. It was a massive hit upon its release, garnering critical acclaim and box office successes one after another. It's still considered to be one of the finest animated films ever made, probably even the best Disney film of all time if not for the film that came directly after it, The Lion King, and it also carries the dubious honour of being the unofficial first Dreamworks film. At least in spirit. Because really, think about it. The jokey mood, the pop culture references, the scope and size of the songs. Aladdin even has that abominable Dreamworks lead character smirk on his face.Not that any of this lessens the quality of the film in any way. This is a magnificent, huge film, one of my ultimate favourites. I love it, I absolutely love it. Everything in it. Aladdin, Jasmine, the fact that they're the best Disney couple by a comfortable margin. They just click instantly and the bazaar scene with the apple is probably one of the finest in the whole film, and that's saying something. And the rest of them as well. Genie, the carpet, Jafar, the whole crew. I also really love that back then they could make movies such as these. Could you imagine them doing a movie like this, with an all-Arabic cast and setting, nowadays? It'd be a horror show.The story is also probably the finest adventure story I've ever seen in an animated film, in any film really. It establishes its premise and basic story effortlessly, is immensely enjoyable and easy to follow, yet contains massive depth through its hinted backstory and its characters. A film you can watch over and over, and still enjoy it just as much as you did the first time. And you know we did watch it, over and over again, as children. And yet it's just as good now, when I rewatched it as an adult. Better even, because you finally get why Aladdin and Jasmine click so well, why Aladdin's final ploy against Jafar was the only one possible and oh so very clever, and why the Genie is such a good, tragic character.You all know this movie. You've all probably seen it multiple times already. But, if you haven't watched it recently, if the last time you saw it was as a child, do rewatch it if you get the chance. You'll be surprised at what you're going to discover within.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
One of Disney's Best,"""Aladdin"" was released in 1992, at the height of Disney's cinematic era. Disney had just made the two greats ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Beauty and the Beast."" Because of this, it might have been hard for Disney to create a film better than their previous ones, but ""Aladdin"" is so well-made with such great performances, namely Robin Williams as the genie, that it can be compared to such classic Disney animated features like ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."" ""Aladdin"" did not start Disney's 'Golden Age', but it did have a lasting impact on animated films still to this day.Aladdin is a ""street-rat"", or so the movie calls him, that one day falls in love with the princess Jasmine. As with the classic Disney formula of the '90s, he can't marry her because he is not a prince. It seems unoriginal now, but back then it was one of the first times a movie had done that. Jafar is the assistant to the King, and he is a generic secretly evil Disney villain. The movie is interesting enough, until you get to the genie. Once you get the Robin William's genie, the movie explodes into a joyride that you can't take your eyes off. Robin Williams gives one of the best performances of his career as the voice of the genie. Take the genie out of the movie, and it is just another Disney film with a generic plot following the same formula. The genie shows how big a supporting character can be. Although he is only a supporting character, the genie turns ""Aladdin"" from a good movie to a Disney classic. Robin Williams took the genie and made that role his. No one else could have done what Robin Williams did with that character. I hear he ad-libbed so much of his lines that they couldn't even submit the script to the Academy for Best Adapted Screenplay. This goes to show how brilliant of an actor Robin Williams was. The ending is a good one for a movie like this, it is very clever and appealing.I'm sorry for the short review, but Aladdin is a short movie while still being one of the best Disney animated features of all time. The villain is a bit dull, but the characters are interesting. The genie is by far the highlight of the movie, and the film is worth watching just for Robin William's performance as the genie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Aladdin,"by Alise BeverlyThe movie that I am reviewing is Aladdin. Aladdin is a Walt Disney production. It in general is usually classified as a movie for children. In this movie there are a lot of main characters. Aladdin, Jasmine, and their friends. The story line goes something like this: There was once a poor man who lived off of stealing bread and finding a place to sleep each night. He dreams of living in a palace and having the things that he doesn't have. This character is Aladdin. On the other hand there is a princess who wishes she was normal and could leave the palace walls to be treated like an everyday person. So she does. She sneaks out of the palace one day and bumps into Aladdin on the streets. Neither one of them know each other's identity, but they finally find out. Through a lot of hard times throughout the movie they finally meet again and fall in love.And who is to blame for them meeting up again? The Genie, of course! Aladdin finds a genie in a bottle that can grant him his every wish. One of which is to cast the evil Jaffar out of the palace and into a genie bottle so he cannot take over and marry Jasmine. She is not in love with him; she is in love with Aladdin. And so the story goes. To find out all of the adventurous details in this movie, go rent it, or buy it. Trust me it will not be a waste of your money!! :)My opinion of this movie is that it is a GREAT movie for any age! It is exciting and fun to watch. This movie will keep you going and on your toes to see what will happen next. It also has a small love story plot to it, too. Now, of course, fairy tales aren't true. But if they were this is the just the sweetest thing ever! A magic carpet ride, being a princess and meeting that special someone just by coincidence. This is a great movie that I have enjoyed my entire life and I know you will enjoy it just as much as I have.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Where does humanity hide behind all these special effects?,"Middle East -once upon a time. Aladdin and his little monkey friend are having a penniless but fun life, playing seek and hide with the Sultan's Guards. But one day, they give a hand to a lovely young person who happens to be Princess Jasmine. Love at first sight, but with not much hope: Princess Jasmine refused so many potential husbands that her father has decided to marry her to the devilish Jafar, his counselor. And anyway, a Princess cannot marry a commoner. Fortunately, Aladdin finds a magic lamp, in which there is a Genie. That will definitely change the situation. Walt Disney features, mirrors of our times, are losing in humanity what they gain in high tech effects. In the case of this so much revised version of the 1001 nights legends, the result is impressive for sure and Robin Williams is a treat. One just feels a little melancholic when comparing with the great classics of the 50's, so much purer, richer, lovable in a word",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Spine Tingling,"I love Disney films. They portray an innocence that is sadly lacking in society today.Despite myself being 18 years old I still get excited when Disney release another songs and end up dragging some poor soul from my Biology course to see it.The songs are a major part of this film and 'A Whole New World' sends tingles down my spine. After hearing the the song 'Proud Of Your Boy' was cut from the film after its writer died, I felt that this song was tribute to the writer and the whole song team. It was simply amazing.When people tell me that they find Disney films stupid it worries me that they have lost that tiny bit of childhood that exists in us all.Aladdin was one of Disneys masterpieces and may their ability to produce such films long continue.I just hope they stick to the drawings compared to the computer animation.

"A thief named Aladdin meets Jasmine and they fall in love, but can't be together because he's no prince","This is a great movie, it has everything a movie needs. It has singing... a great song by the way, it has drama, it has romance, it has fight scenes. I really enjoyed this movie. The plot of this movie is that Princess Jasmine is supposed to get married to a prince but every prince she meets always want the same things and she doesn't like any of them. When she found Aladdin she really liked him because he was different, he wasn't a rich snotty boy, he was poor and he cared about her, all of the rest didn't make it seem like they really cared about her... she trusted Aladdin with her life because he saved her. He is a pure hearted young man who would do anything for the poor or hurt. He is a pure hearted person. It starts in involve a genie later when Jafar, the ""butler"" of the Sulfur which is Princess Jasmines father wants Aladdin to get the lamp for him because only a pure hearted individual can go into the cave where the lamp is and get it. Aladdin starts to use the lamp for 3 wishes and outsmarts him twice. A really funny movie and a great movie to watch as a family.

"The Genie's jokes are outdated, but who cares?","There are already so many reviews for Aladdin that I could hardly state anything new, but now that Disney has released the movie on DVD - and they did a great job doing it - I felt like I need to comment on it too.I first watched Aladdin when it was in the cinemas in 1992/1993 at the age of 9. You know, like most of my friends too I just LOVED Aladdin. It was such a beautiful love story (the ""A Whole New World"" scene and the ""Kiss the Girl"" scene in The Little Mermaid are the most romantic moments in animated history, I'm sure)and the settings were simply enchanting. This movie made me want to go to Agrabah myself - although I never had a thing for desert landscapes.Plus, let's not forget, Aladdin is Disney's sexiest character!! That's what I thought back then and I haven't changed my mind ever since :-)Of course, the Genie is hilarious and it's true that Robin Williams' jokes and parodies are outdated now, but keep in mind that the movie was a worldwide success, although most of the people he imitates are not well known outside the US. I didn't even recognize Arsenio Hall, since I only know him from ""Coming to America"" with Eddie Murphy. Sure, it's even more fun if you actually know whom the Genie is making fun of, but it's also great fun if you don't.So I would love to say it's THE best animated movie ever, but Disney has released so many masterpieces in the 90s that it would be unfair to say that this one is the best. Anyway, if you're reading this to decide if you want to get it on DVD, I can only recommend it. Disney did a great job creating the special edition 2 disc release. I've been waiting for it for 11 years!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Fun and funny.,"Aladdin is a very fun movie and one of the few I enjoy watching again and again.  It has many of Disney's most entertaining characters, and you gotta love that Genie!I also like how it combines drama, romance, and different styles of comedy into one picture.  Many have said this film won't stand the test of time due to it's current events nature, but there is enough comedy of a more general sort to make the film watchable many years from now.P.S.  In regards to the comments by those accusing the film of using American accents for the good guys and ""Arabian"" accents for the bad guys. I just don't see it.  Neither of the two main villains (Jafar and Iago) have anything remotely resembling an ""Arabian"" accent, and even the mean palace guards are accentless.  The only character I can think of as having anything that could be construed as an ""Arabian"" (of course, there are many different types of Arabian accents not just one, but I digress) accent is the narrator, and he certainly is not a bad guy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Great film,"Glad, they change the plot somewhat from the original tale. One of the verses of the opening song ""Arabian Nights"" in the film had to be altered following protests from the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) due to its violence lyrics about cutting ears. There is also protest raise by another scene where Aladdin is mistaken by critics due to the line, 'Good Kitty, take off' which the critics thought he was saying 'Good teenagers, take off your clothes'. Because of the controversy, Disney replaced the phrase with ""Down, kitty"" on the DVD release. People have also took noticed with the similarities between Aladdin and Richard Williams's film The Thief and the Cobbler AKA The Princess and the Cobbler (1993). Though Aladdin was released prior to The Thief and the Cobbler, The Thief and the Cobbler was started much earlier in the 1960s, so they have been dispute who rip off who even up to today. The film story is about Aladdin (voiced by Scott Weigner) a poor but kind-hearted Agrabah thief who finds himself arrested for thievery. Jafar (voiced by Jonathan Freeman) promise him a reward in return for retrieving the lamp from the Cave of Wonders, a mysterious magical cave. Jafar tries to betray him for the lamp, and Aladdin find himself trapped in the collapsed cave. In the collapsed cave, Aladdin rubs the lamp, unexpectedly unleashing Genie (Voiced by Robin Williams), who reveals he will grant Aladdin three wishes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

But what make's this movie really great is, Robin Williams performance as the comedic, blue Genie. He really steals the show and does a really funny job as he impersonates celebrities including Jack Nicholson and Rodney Dangerfield. He also does a great job doing the singing voice for Genie.

The scenes without the Genie and Iago are the slow ones,"After making me vote their animated version of ""Beauty And The Beast"" the previous year as ""the worst film that I have ever seen"", Walt Disney Pictures follows up on that flop with their animated version of ""Aladdin."" ""Aladdin"" was a little known fairy tale before the old mouse house popularized it. The story has to deal with the decisions that have to be reached by various characters. There's Aladdin, a young streetwise beggar who has to steal food from the marketplace in order to survive. There's Princess Jasmine who has to find herself a permanent suitor before her next birthday and there's Jafar, a wicked royal vizier who is obsessed with his ambitions to become sultan. These three characters eventually come together and it's not an entirely pretty sight. However, all of this is secondary when compared to the hilarious genie whom Aladdin and Jafar both fight for the ownership of and then there's Iago, Jafar's hilariously smart aleck parrot sidekick. These two characters are the highest points in what a basically just a minor improvement over ""Beauty And The Beast.""

A movie which turns me into a kid,"When I was a child, during eid holidays Disney channel was added in my TV for three days and in that I got to see Aladdin cartoon. I don't remember any story or scenes but the only thing I remembered was that I thoroughly enjoyed it. Years later, when I was watching TV I was checking the info of coming programmes in a movie channel and I saw there was Aladdin so I thought to check it out that time though I never had any idea of the 1992 film. And when I started watching I got surprised to see those same cartoon characters I saw in my childhood. Looked like my childhood came back.
The biggest plus point of Aladdin is its mesmerizing and fascinating hand drawn animation which transports you to another world. The next plus point is its humor and light hearted treatment. All the characters shown in this film I love a lot. Charming Aladdin, stunning Jasmine, cute like a Teddy bear Sultan, cunning and wicked Jafar and his loudmouthed sidekick iago, greedy but lovable Abu, helpful magic carpet and the wholesome entertainer Genie(thanks to the super energetic Robin Williams). Only rajah was underused in the whole movie but his relationship with jasmine was shown pretty well.Last but not the least to mention is the songs which goes well with the narrative. I love all the songs especially Arabian nights, friend like me, Prince Ali and whole new world.
But the only issue which bugged me was the palace shown doesn't have any watchmen, bodyguards, servants and maid. What palace is it without them? There is only sultan, jasmine and rajah inside the palace. Did the animators forget to draw them or didn't have the budget for it?
Aladdin is the best animation movie in the world, and the best Disney film. I don't why today's Disney films don't have the magic of Aladdin.

Strong First Half descending Into Utter Stupidity,"A largely overrated and over cherished animated movie, 'Aladdin' has good ideas at heart then squanders them in place of gimmicks and ridicule.The voice acting from the main cast is excellent, in particular from Jonathan Freeman, Robin Williams and Gilbert Gottfried.The visuals and landscapes are lush and vibrant, and I love the layers to the view distance. The songs are fairly middling, but portrayed on screen well.Where the movie severely struggles is in its second half. Although moments of comic genius involving a beloved genie produces significant hilarity, the level of unapproachable dumbness in the inability for characters to recognise each other, in addition to overly convenient plot devices, renders the final acts hard to swallow.",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
One Of Disney's Best! Robin Williams Performance is Fantastic,"Disney has so many classics, Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, but one of the greatest is Aladdin with flying carpets, magical Genies, giant talking sand monsters. Aladdin is beloved by me along with millions of others and it will be loved by many more with this new Diamond DVD.Aladdin has so many jokes that it makes you laugh, but also has quite a few dramatic scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat with relationships sprouting into wonderful romance. And, it is all wrapped together in one fantastic adventure.The story begins when a Middle Eastern princess decides she had enough of being stuck in her palace and goes out into the city for once in her life. She goes to the market and gets in a little bit of trouble, thanks to a poor young man named Aladdin. Sadly, he is accused of kidnapping the princess. Now in jail, he and another man manage to escape to go find a massive treasure and most importantly - a Genie bottle. The Genie (our favorite Robin Williams) comes out and grants Aladdin three wishes - now Aladdin can decide what he wants to do.Aladdin is such a fantastic and entertaining film. The animation is just mind blowing. How good it is, considering that it was made over 20 years ago, how full of emotion the voice actors ate, it is quite different than many other famous Disney animations. With such a famous cast, it is truly a masterpiece. And, quite nostalgic to hear Robin Williams' so recognizable voice as this is one of his most iconic roles. It really shows how he entertained the world with laughter for so many years. The soundtrack in Aladdin is incredible. Each song is catchy and kind of gets stuck in your head (I will show you the woooorld!) and so many of them are now classic songs that people of different generations sing.This special Diamond edition of Aladdin comes with quite a few bonus features. In one of my favorites, conversations with the casts, I found out a lot of interesting facts such as Scott Weinger, the voice of Aladdin, actually didn't know how to sing when he auditioned for it at the age of 15! There are also several deleted scenes, showing how different they originally planned the film and even a deleted song that was done by Jafar, (Jonathon Freeman)!My favorite scene is when Aladdin releases Genie for the first time and he quickly gets out of his small bottle (he is rather big). I love his first line, ""10,000 years will give you such a crick in the neck!"" I love this scene because instead of ranting about something, he just does his first line as a pretty funny joke, which forever brought this lovable special character into our lives.Aladdin has something similar to the other Disney animated films in that they are meant for the whole family. So, I recommend it for ages 7 to 18. I wouldn't show it to kids younger than seven because there are a few dramatic scenes that might be frightening for then. It isn't exactly bright and fun throughout the whole film. I give it five out of five stars because this is truly a classic and I love every aspect of it, especially our wonderful Genie who we miss every day.Reviewed by Gerry O. KIDS FIRST!

Ranks Among My Top 10,"Like ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Aladdin"" holds some of my fondest childhood memories. Like the other two, I watched this in the theaters (even vividly remembering how I was annoyed that the princess was given a modern name). What's great about ""Aladdin"" is that Disney didn't try to duplicate ""Beauty"", which was arguably a huge hit. Instead, it's the complete opposite of Beauty: a quirk-filled comedy owned almost entirely by the Genie (Robin Williams). Artistically, it's also a departure from its predecessors. Aladdin doesn't look like your typical Disney film. Every object in the background is rounded, like the characters, and the style is more loose and cartoony. The music is a notch down from ""Mermaid"" and ""Beauty"" but ""Prince Ali"" and ""A Whole New World"" hold up pretty well. All in all, another winner from Disney. The Platinum Edition DVD is still available in most markets outside the US, so grab one while you can.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

"The best Disney movie, EVER!","Aladdin. It came out when I was 13, and I have always loved it. Its by far the funniest Disney movie, its got the best music ever, and the one of the best Disney villains too. I had to watch it 9 times in a two day period at work, because they were playing it in the electronics section...I didn't mind, what a treat!!! The music is fantastic, every song is funny, and great to sing along with. (Ive got the lyrics memorized.) Some of the most memorable characters are Jafar, hes so delightfully evil, and that smart-alec parrot Iago, who is annoying, but has such great lines and keeps getting flattened. I also love the Sultan, Jasmines father. Hes cute, and very typical of a worried father, and he is quite funny. The best character IS of course the Genie. This movie has great effects, even for back in 1992, lots of adventure, and I highly recommend it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Excellent movie- best Disney movie EVER!,"This is an excellent movie and should be one of the best of all Disney movies.  It has fabulous animation and wonderful characters.  All the actors do a great job, especially Jasmine and Aladdin.

A Whole New World indeed!,"I loved this movie, not only is it my favourite Disney film but it is one of my fave films altogether.The setting (Agrabah) is beautiful and the characters are a joy to watch and listen to. Within five minutes you become gripped and long to see more There are some equally joyous and poignant moments in the film that determine the ups and downs of Aladdin's journey from a poor street rat to a romantic lover. You feel personally involved with the main characters (Aladdin and Jasmine in particular) when they go through their complex emotions, but also the Genie, who longs for freedom The songs are fantastic, whether you seek tradition ('Arabian Nights') or romance ('A Whole New World').Spectacular fun for the whole family, not to be missed!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Robin Williams is hilarious,"Aladdin/1992/***1/2Main Stars: Scott Weinger Robin Williams Linda LarkinThe start of ""classic films"" is exciting. I've done many reviews so far and doing even more is exciting. I've seen a lot of ""classic films"" for my age including a film which I didn't think was so classic, ""Jason and the Argonauts"" (1963). I know for the timeframe that special effects were not too good but I still laughed at how fake the effects (done by Ray Harryhausen) were. Especially when the main character Jason had to fight a dragon and the dragon was pathetic! It looked like clay attacking this horrible actor. Actually, all the acting was horrible in the movie. Great, I wandered off again. Back to the movie I was supposed to review; Aladdin is a great, hilarious, well-acted movie. The only thing wrong with it was that it was too short (at least to me it was). They could have easily made it longer with more comical, great scenes. Don't get me wrong, it was a great movie but I thought some extra scenes could have been added. You're probably thinking that I saw this just to make the review and never before; but actually, I have seen this movie many times before this review was typed. I won't tell you too much, but this movie is about a poor peasant boy (Scott Weinger) who discovers a lamp and the lamp beholds a Genie (Robin Williams) that grants three and only three wishes. Aladdin meets this beautiful princess named Jasmine (Linda Larkin) and wishes to become a prince and marry her. But someone named Jafar and his stupid annoying parrot (voice of Gilbert Godfreed) keeps delaying him. If you haven't seen this movie yet (I doubt it), you should see it now and laugh at the comical scenes and also cry at the songs (""A Whole New World""- by Alan Menken & Tim Rice) but I really didn't cry at the songs at all. Movie directed by John Musker and Ron Clements.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Great story. I hated the execution,"Beautiful adventure/love story with great characters and a very well developed (for what it is) romantic relationship between the protagonists. Also disney 2D animation at is finest. The songs are good too, although I didn't love them.But my God there is so much that I didn't like. First and foremost the humor. There is way too much humor or at least too much humor that didn't land for me, including the obscene amount of 4th wall breaking humor that just didn't fit at all.Also, there are too many ""silly characters"" that makes the movie unbearable: Abu the monkey, Iago the parrot and the universally beloved Genie. In the end that may be the biggest problem for me, as I don't like Robin Williams in general and I didn't find his Genie amusing in the slightlest (although he was great the 2 or 3 seconds he wasn't being overtly annoying on purpose).",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Spleen-big words for someone with little good-taste,"Aladdin was and continues to be a Disney masterpiece. Previous opinions of Aladdin have definitely not been well-founded. Certain previous predictions made by a certain registrar to this site concerning Aladdin were closed-minded and tasteless. Has The hilarity of Robin Williams as Genie fizzled? Have the wonder of the magical images and music in this animated movie ever faltered? Anyone who can trash Disney's talent is, among other things, not a true Disney fan but also cynical of anything that does not conform to the ideas of reality. You, ""Spleen"" have absolutely no imagination and have no qualifications to degrade any Disney creation. You obviously did not watch the film as a complete whole and you missed every message Disney was trying to send. Aladdin is a story of impossible love come true...A love that conquers all, a caste system, that surpasses wealth and stature and combines a whole array of wonderful, unforgettable characters. Friendship and Love starts in one of Disney's most magical creations ever. I have watched this movie about a million times and would recommend it too all as a family film.

"You'll fall for this movie, if you don't you've got no heart!","Hey I was just kidding there but seriously, Aladdin is one of the best Disney movies ever made. Its my all- time favourite movie and I never tire of watching it millions of times (I'm 17). Every moment is 'red-letter'!!!! I love it so much that I can't even express how good it is right now, but I'll give it a go. Firstly, its totally original and not the stereotypical 'fairytale' like previous Disney films. Its fresh and modern and simply fizzes with energy and light humour. The animation is really special, because the style is unique, too. All the characters are voiced so amazingly that you adore all of them, even the villain Jafar but particularly the Genie- he's a champ. The music is one of Disney's best as well- every song is a favourite of mine, particularly 'A Whole New World'. Aladdin is definitely one of those movies where you know and recite along to all the words and songs because it feels natural that way. So if you haven't seen it yet, don't just sit there reading this, actually buy it!!! You won't regret it- the second disc has stacks of great special features- you have to check it out and see for yourself because its definitely worth it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
"Aladdin may not be as powerful as ""The Beauty and the Beast"" or ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"", but is one hell of an entertaining time from Disney.","Disney doesn't really pull your heart strings with this, but it is without a doubt an extremely entertaining film. The songs are very well done. Of course we all know that ""A Whole New World"" is a fantastic song that really gets stuck in your head. The animation on characters isn't as good as it was in ""The Beauty and the Beast"", but it makes up for that with extremely epic moments like when they are trying to escape The Cave of Wonders. Characters aren't the greatest Disney has done. That is except for Genie. Robin Williams delivers a funny, energetic, and extremely entertaining performance. You can ask anyone on the planet what their favorite part of Aladdin is, and they will all answer Robin Williams. The Genie in my opinion is definitely one of the great Disney characters. The romance (just like the animation) is not as good as it was in ""The Beauty and the Beast"". Still the romance is filled with all the good old mushy stuff that little kids always turn their head at. In the end Aladdin isn't one of Disney's finest achievements, but it is one great time that I enjoy having.4 stars out of 4",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Simply fantastic!,"Aladdin should be considered amongst Disney's most complete films. The idea of having a movie set in Middle East territories was excellent mainly because Disney knows how to print it's unique style on different cultures around the world.Aladdin starts powerful with the super ""Arabian Nights"" song, and since then, it gets your attention but most important, sets the mood for the movie. More than half of the movie's atmosphere deals with Robin Williams's marvelous comedic performance. I mean, how could an actor deliver an extremely funny performance as an animated character? Only a talented actor can do that.The Genie character steals the show as the most charming character, sure; but without such an effective villain like Jaffar, a likable hero like Aladdin, and a very charming and sexy heroine like Jasmine, this movie wouldn't work completely.Apart from the spectacular and beautiful settings, the movie relies it's success on supporting characters (very likable), a magic and fantastic plot, and best of all, tremendously catchy and quality songs.The ending will leave you breathless mainly because of it's intensity (loved the Jaffar cobra and master wizard of evil!) and positive message. As it should happen, good triumphs over evil.This is one of Disney's best and just paves the way for the brilliant and masterpiece ""The Lion King"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Robin Williams makes this movie the way it is,"OMG I loved this film since I was a kid. I bought the DVD of it 2 years ago and I was so glad that I bought it. The story is about a commoner who stumbles across an enchanted lamp that holds a hilarious blue Genie who grants him 3 wishes. Aladdin falls in love with an Arabian princess who's father wants her to marry but she doesn't want to marry someone that she doesn't love so one day she disguises herself as a commoner and as the people at the marketplace think that Aladdin is a street rat she is smitten by him. I could go on but I am not giving away too many details as some people mightn't even see this film before. Packed with great music and a great message for people who are commoners and that is 'Accept a person who isn't from a royal background and don't pretend to be a prince(which Aladdin did as he was in love with Jasmine and he thinks that she doesn't date or marry nobody's) and that you just have to be yourself. The chemistry between Aladdin & Jasmine is absolutely fantastic and I love the A Whole New World Scene because its so magical. The real star to this movie is of course Robin Williams who was so hilarious in this movie I laughed so hard every time he impersonates someone e.g Jack Nicolsen or that guy that plays the terminator Arnold (I don't know the surname) but having said that he is the best comedian of all time along with Jim Carrey. The animation is very well done and the ballad A Whole New World is so cute. A friend like me & Prince Ali which is both sung by Robin Williams(yes folks he can sing) are so funny I loved it. Aladdin is my 4th favourite movie of all time along with The Little Mermaid, Beauty & the Beast & Enchanted.Worth watching for all you Disney lovers like me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

The Genie by Robin Williams,"Aladdin, a small thief from Agrabah, happens to stumble upon a charming young woman in the marketplace with whom he seems to fall deeply in love. Fooled by an old man, Aladdin gets his hands on a magical lamp which contains a magical genie who can grant any three wishes to his master. Thus, he will have to use all the help he can get to win his beloved's heart, especially from his new blue friend.This classic Disney movie presents the life of a young man who struggles with poverty but is determined to do whatever it takes to improve his situation and ultimately be with the one he loves, although she seems out of his league. It's a magical story which presents the main protagonist's struggle, his way of making hard decisions and his fight with a new enemy gained along the way. It's ok for the most part, but unfortunately, it isn't spectacular either. It is rather predictable and although it has one or two twists up its sleeve, it isn't able to maintain a high standard throughout. It even tends to be superficial in some aspects, especially regarding solving the main problems, but as it is targeted towards kids, I guess it's ok as it is.Its characters are quite stereotypical (the good guy, the evil one, the princess and so on) but manage to provide a good time, especially through the genie which as far as I'm concerned, represents the core of the movie. He's the one which brings colour into the picture, who makes you laugh out loud many times and puts a smile on your face with every apparition. Robin Williams has done a truly impressive job voice acting this character, making it one of a kind. I should also mention Abu, Aladdin's trusty monkey which is always there when he needs assistance. It's also very charismatic and even cute, sending plenty of emotion towards the viewer.In terms of entertainment, the movie has plenty to offer. You get many action sequences in which Aladdin proves his abilities, you get a lot of musical moments which are always welcome and you even get plenty of jokes, especially with the genie around. The visual part is also a big plus, looking very good even today, judging by the fact that it has over twenty years and counting.To sum things up, it's a classic story which almost every kid knows, which brings plenty of good time with everything it does, even after seeing it multiple times, but if you ask me, it could have done a bit more in terms of story. Nevertheless, it's a very good animation which made a great impact when it first came so its merits will always be appreciated.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Aladdin,"I just recently watched Aladdin on my DVD. I enjoyed the crystal-clear, completely restored picture and the movie itself was very enjoyable. Young Aladdin plays a ""street rat"" who must steal to get his food but still has a good heart (in one scene we see him give his hard-earned food to some hungry little children.) When he becomes trapped in a cave of wonders, he meets the goofy genie who can grant him three wishes, and I don't want to spoil it for you if you haven't seen it so I'll leave it at that. The voices, especially the Genie's (done by Robin Williams) and Iago the parrot (none other than Gilbert Gottfried- I think I spelled that right...)are good and the story is a very enjoyable one. The songs were very catchy. One thing I didn't like was how on the DVD they have all these extra features- on the second disk there is tons of stuff about how the movie was made and the characters were designed and things like that. However, I'm sure some people might find these things interesting so it's up to your opinion. I did like the deleted songs and scenes and when they gave reasons for why they didn't put them into the film.

Aladdin is not match to Hercules.,even though Aladdin is funny but not impressive as Hercules. Hercules make me understand what is called being a hero. but this movie Aladdin needs upgrade because I am not impressed and satisfied with the movie why even Aladdin is for adventure not for education as Hercules and Lion king. however it didn't match to lion king. the movie is not amazing because they did not try so hard as lion king. Lion king is best because not so much disappointing as Hercules. However I expect more from Aladdin. P.S this movie shows some graphic images like trying to cut of some one's arm and this movie needs lot of upgrade it's too unsatisfying because it didn't match to lion king and Hercules. if I see the movie I would be less uncomfortable but not so bad as Sailor moon. one thing I like about this movie was genie who is hilarious but Aladdin is not that powerful or smart as Simba who kicked Scar.

Probably one of the best animated cartoons I know,"I only recite films that I want to talk about when you've seen a movie and your body just wants to talk to all the people you met in life about the movie. Normally I only talk about how much a movie annoyed me or disappointed me because unfortunately it is the only feeling I have felt in the last few years. This movie has turned everything upside down.
I was overwhelmed from the first second by the world of the colors of the music
Usually I skip the songs in Disney movies because you just do not need them to understand the movie here I wanted to hear the music and here you really miss something if you should skip the music. There is a song that I have not listened to either in the movie nor in any other way because I just do not want to hear now but I could listen to Robin Williams as the genius for days.
May the man rest in peace he was definitely a legend who left us something big, but even so, it is a unique film with a unique display of unique animation and unique everythingOne thing I can not get over today is that Aladdin might have had a wish or that some of Jafar's stuff is not cleared up but every time I see the movie I do not care because I just want to be kidnapped by this world because it feels so good and looks so good.Of course, many things have changed but this is a movie you have to change some things because the same things do not work in different media and of course the movie is more based on the indian rather than the arabic culture but this is a fairy tale and no docu anyone who can Coin takes anyway is too stupid to enjoy movies decently.Some of my story problems are changed and clarified in the play, but we're talking about the film here and rate the movie as a whole
How could you save the movie?

Absolutely Amazing.....,"Better than even Beauty and the Beast. Though not as meaningful to me as The Jungle Book, Aladdin is still one of the greatest Disney films I've seen. Amazing music, beautiful scenery, and without competition the greatest Disney villain of all time, Jafar (He could kick Ursula's, Gaston's, or Scar's butts in a second).Everyone talks of how funny the actors, especially Robin Williams, are. I agree, but people need to realize that Scott Weinger as Aladdin, Linda Larkin as Jasmine, and all the others were great as well. They are all just as good as Robin Williams, but in a different, more dramatic way.As usual, the plot of beggar Aladdin and Princess Jasmine fighting for their love is incredible. I can understand how some people would complain that the same old love story is being shown over and over again, but remember, Aladdin was one of the first ""modern"" Disney movies that implemented the love story. Therefore, do not blame this film, blame Disney for creating the same thing year upon year after this pioneer came along (Though personally, I still enjoy some of the love story flicks).   Whoever dislikes this film needs a brain scan done on them.P.S.

magical,"'Aladdin' is probably my favorite animated movie of all time. The best thing about the film is that no matter what your age, you'll love this movie because it has everything that makes a great film. It has great voice acting, awesome action, very funny jokes from Robin Williams, a classic story, and a classic romance. Scott Weinger's voice is near perfect as Aladdin. It blends so well with the character, almost seamlessly. The hilight of the film is Robin Williams as the Blue Genie. His jokes are nothing short of hysterical, and there are some jokes that only adults will get. He does an impressive array of impressions including Jack Nicholson and Rodney Dangerfield. The only fault I have is Linda Larkin as Jasmine. She just doesn't seem right, but it isn't that big of a deal. The songs are absolutely spectacular, the best being 'Whole New World'. The film is still as good to me at age 17 as it was at age 7, because it is just so magical and lovable. It's a classic through the ages that I think everyone should watch.

A massive Disney entertainment,"This movie is very close to being one of the best Disney films I have ever seen. There was never a moment where I wanted to turn away from watching this hugely entertaining picture of wild improvisation, stunning animation, subtle-comedy, and scene stealing characters. Robin Williams played an excellent jet fuelled Genie and until now I never thought of him as much of a singer, but he really had me kicking to the beat of ""Never Had a Friend like Me"". And that was just one of the many songs I loved in this movie. I also enjoyed that song ""A Whole New World"" It had a very beautiful motion to it, I can see why that won an Academy Award. And what about that guy with the twisted beard and the staff, Jafar I think it was, he was such an awesome villain, he had all the qualities of a perfect bad guy, and his genius was well backed up by that sarcastic loudmouth sidekick Iago, he cracked me up. Aladdin is one of those movies that you never get tired of watching. Sure it doesn't have that heart-warming storyline that made other movies like ""Beauty and the Beast"" famous.

"Disney, where have you gone?","This really is something special. As a kid, this was an amazing film; hilarious, thrilling, engaging and definitely on par with Disney's best. Coming back to it after so long and little has changed. However, there were a few things that detracted my present experience from that of my childhood. The first half of the film is overall a little on the boring side. Other than the unveiling of Robin Williams' show stopping Genie, the music, visuals and Jafar, the rest of characters weren't as compelling as i remember. The main protagonists and their romantic endeavour isn't the most magical in Disney's history (compared to say ""Lady and the Tramp"" it's desperately shallow), which is a shame since they take up most of the plot. Jasmine is still gorgeous with a fiery personality trying to break free of a restrained life, but Aladdin is quite a standard underdog, his plight not really drawing great sympathy, despite the fact he's a swell guy and all with a heart of gold. So really, Jasmine's attraction to him comes of quite ""same old trick"" sort of thing, both individuals having the same ""trapped"" feeling in life that brings them together.Saying that, ""A Whole New World"" is still a breathtaking number, and that entire scene at least gives the romantic plot a more than satisfactory feeling. And that's Aladdin's key. It's last half is fabulous. From the transformation of Aladdin into Prince Ali to the very end, it's hard to find a glaring fault. For some reason everything just comes together. You care for the protagonists, Jafar just keeps getting more evil, and the animation is the definition of top draw (always is). In the end you just know you've seen something great and you don't care how it happened but your glad it did, like you've really been in a whole new world for an hour and a half (almost). The slowish first half just dissolves into memory, until you watch it again (you will), and once again, the second half will drag you back into it all and you'll love it even more.It's also worth noting that the one absolute constant in all of this is the Genie. Once he appears with the classic ""Friend Like Me"", every scene he's in comes alive due to Williams' blinding comic momentum, plus the animators' endlessly imaginative play. He's definitely the most engaging, sympathetic character in the film and you really feel for him and his own wish to be free of the lamp.Aladdin is, and always will be, a Disney classic in my books. It's difficult to pinpoint how it does it, but it just does. A shining testament of what the company was and still is capable of when they really put their soul and time into something they really want to do, instead of something they think they need to do, which sadly seems to be to keep the company on it's feet so they can make even more money. There was a time when art, entertainment and dreams trumped everything else, the reason why ""Disney's Folly"" as it was dismissively called so long ago, became the pioneer in one of cinema's most magical medias. That was the idea that gave birth to films like this and a whole lot of others they did themselves (right up to as recently as Tarzan and Lilo & Stitch), plus the gems that everyone else have achieved. Lets hope the company gets through this dry spell and returns for another go round. They did it before, they can do it again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Robin Williams Was Born to Be a Cartoon,"A fantastic animated film from Disney's early-1990s animated renaissance.Following closely on the heels of ""Beauty and the Beast,"" ""Aladdin"" doesn't have that film's amazing storytelling and strong emotional pull, but it makes up for it with dazzling animation and a terrific score. Robin Williams was born to play an animated genie, apparently, and his performance is inspired. You can almost see the animators sweating to keep up with Williams' dizzying improvisation.And Jafar, the droll sorcerer that serves as this film's bad guy, is perhaps my favorite Disney villain ever.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Geeky Randy's summary,"Extraordinary Disney retelling of THE ARABIAN NIGHTS tale about an impoverished young ne'er-do-well who is recruited and then double-crossed by a sorcerer, only to find himself in possession of a wonderful oil lamp that houses a genie who will grant him three wishes. The addition of extra characters and razzle-dazzle make the journey even more worthwhile, adding a charm to this old story without diluting what made it a classic in the first place. Much excitement despite being lighthearted. The voice actors fit their animated characters perfectly, with Robin Williams easily stealing the show with his grand performance as the Genie. Composer Alan Menken and songwriters Howard Ashman and Tim Rice created one of film's greatest soundtracks. Exceptional animation as well.**** (out of four)",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Hilarious piece of animation,"This movie is truly hilarious and it appeals to both children and most adults.It isn't only the comic genius of Robin Williams as the Genie, or Gilbert Godfried (sp?) as the parrot, but it's the little subtle bits of humor like facial expressions, inside jokes, one liners, and the humor of the overall scenes themselves.But, if the humor wasn't enough for you, it's got a very addictive soundtrack, much of the music is very catchy and I found myself singing along to a few of the songs after watching it for the first time. I think that the Prince Ali song is my favorite, mostly for the song, but partially because of the parade format of the scene.If the humor and the music wasn't enough to suck you in, we also have some rather amazing action scenes (yes, I know it's animated, but it's done so well that you get pulled right into the scene itself) having something to do with what appears to be a mixture of old fashioned animation and computer animation.See this movie, you will not be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
The Diamond in the Rough,"In 1992, Disney released their 31st animated feature, Aladdin. Based on a concept from the late Howard Ashman and its directors Ron Clements and John Musker coming off the success of The Little Mermaid, the film was a humongous success on its original release and has since spawned countless merchandise, sequels, and even a live-action remake in 2019. Known for its innovative usage of pop culture spewing humor that would soon become a staple in the mainstream animation industry, the film itself is both a hysterical comical roller coaster and a surprisingly heartwarming story on being honest about yourself.Set in the fictional Arabian village of Agrabah, the film follows street urchin Aladdin who discovers a magic lamp containing a genie. With the genie's help, Aladdin dons a wealthy prince facade to impress the Sultan's free-spirited daughter, Princess Jasmine, while the Sultan's vizier Jafar has other plans in mind for the lamp. At its heart, Aladdin is a tale of overcoming royal law to be true to yourself, proving how love and honesty triumph over greed and vanity. However, while Aladdin's arc as a kind-hearted thief plays a big role in the feature, it's the Genie himself who steals the show with Robin Williams carrying not only the humor, but also the tone itself. While the stakes can get really intense once Jafar comes into the scene, the genie's improvisational bantering and pop culture lampoons are what keep the feature well balanced in what could have easily been a case of tonal whiplash. It's no wonder this film is often regarded as one of Williams' most highly known works, because even in spite of what he went through during the making of the feature, his comical genius stood on top.Outside of the comical areas, the building romance between Aladdin and Princess Jasmine is quite sweet and down to earth. Although neither of them come from the same economical background, their love of the open world is what makes them work so well together, helped much by Scott Weinger and Linda Larkin's believable chemistry. Next to Jafar's understandable disdain of being in the Sultan's position, his sidekick parrot Iago is a nice addition to the sardonic roster, topped by the brilliant casting of the late Gilbert Gottfried. Outside of the Sultan's naivety in what his daughter wants, the other characters add on the plot merely by decisions alone, including Aladdin's monkey friend Abu and their pantomime flying carpet. As far as the other cast go, it must be stated that the one glaring flaw of the feature lies in its use of ethnic stereotypes. Not only do most of the characters appear with exaggerated grotesque facial features, but the glaring contrast of Aladdin and Jasmine looking like white American teenagers leaves much to be desired in the representation department.Going into the animation and art direction, the biggest influence on the film stylistically would be caricaturist Al Hirschfeld, apparently derived from the flowing and swooping lines found in Arabic calligraphy. In terms of both the designs and motion, despite the aforementioned problematic character features, the work done on the cast is so smooth and full of life, with some of the acting and flowing motion done in a Disney feature at that point. The real animation star is the Genie's lead animator Eric Goldberg, who was able to blend Robin Williams' talent and the natural flowing line motion in tremendous transmogrifying action. The color palettes are also quite appealing as well, detailing a limited but brightly saturated landscape all around the already fully detailed environments. Next to a lot of brilliantly crafted effects work and computer generated motion graphics still beyond this world, Aladdin could arguably be the most appropriately ridiculous Disney feature as far as aping a true cartoony style. 30 years today, it's visual laughs just as much as its verbal laughs.As for the musical numbers, while Howard Ashman did contribute some worthy material to the film, his tragic death and the Disney execs caused much of his work to be scrapped and finished up by Tim Rice. That being said, both of their contributions work so well in the context of the feature and for genuine fun. While the exotic albeit controversial Arabian Nights establishes what we're in for, the fast paced One Jump Ahead briskly sets up Aladdin's character with his unfortunate state and a lot of relatable banter. Next to that, the Genie's numbers, Friend Like Me and Prince Ali, mix the whimsy with the looney in showing off what the magical servant can pull off in getting Aladdin closer to Jasmine, aided by some of the funniest lyrics in Disney history. However, the one true heartfelt glimmer would be the Oscar winning A Whole New World, which embraces Aladdin and Jasmine's relationship growing grander through all sorts of worlds they've never seen before. Through humor, pathos and fantasy, the soundtrack of Aladdin will forever earn its rightful place in music history.While more comical in tone than other Disney films for its time and even now, Aladdin is a beautifully drawn fun time with plenty of heart, lovable characters and timeless songs. It's hard to imagine any other film like this making such an impact in animation, whether for better or worse, and that alone makes it a must see for any generation (albeit with caution regarding some unfortunate depictions). Despite the Disney studio often preferring to break as much new ground in animated cinema as they can, works like Aladdin can remind us all that even the most daring companies can take a break and make us all laugh.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
A true Disney classic,Well now back in the early ninties Disney released the classic retelling of Alladin and the Genie from the classic stories told long ago about a man finding a magic lamp with an even more magical genie that will grant his master anything that he chooses.This adaptation was really well done and I must give Disney props for actually taking the male hero in the tale and making him into something more than a two dimensional prince character. The songs are enjoyable and the voice acting is very good. Robin Williams excels and the Genie and truly is the biggest of the stars in this film. The other voices are well done and fairly well memorable and the movie itself is a great enjoyable fun.If you are wanting to make a Disney Collection the one is not complete without this film.,8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
"Disney at their Finest,","Aladdin is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding voice cast. It is without a doubt one of my favourite Disney films, I loved it as a child and watching it today I still throughly enjoy it. The characters are great and the music is superb, I don't think I will ever forget the lyrics to Whole New World or Friend Like Me. The highlight of the entire movie is without a doubt the Genie, superbly voiced by Robin Williams, who was given the rare opportunity of improvising his lines in an animated film, and that made it turn out so well, the kind of crazy lines delivered by Genie never would have happened if they just got Williams to read from a script. Really fun and a true animated classic, I would recommend Aladdin to anyone looking for a good film for the whole family to enjoy.A young thief is given the opportunity to be with a princess he is in love with when he finds a magic lamp with a genie that will grant him three wishes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

My absolute favorite Disney film,"I love Aladdin it has always been my favorite Disney film. It had excellent animation, great voice actors, songs were amazing, and really good characters. I loved every moment of watching it The animation is excellent. When Aladdin came out, they thought it was going to be a huge flop because of the success of beauty and the beast earlier that year. Well it did very well even the animation was great. who ever thought Disney could create excellent scenery for a sandy dessert, a tiger talking cave, a market place, and a flying carpet? Great voice actors all i can say. This proves that Disney doesn't need a list celeberties to play their characters. Yes Aladdin had Robin Wiliams and Scott weigner (steve from FullHouse) and most people probably knew the voice of Iago (forget how to spell his name)and the rest weren't very well known however you don't need well known voice actors to create great characters.Aladdin has great songs to. Though in my opinion not as great as the lion king songs( because i like Elton's music) it still had great songs. It was also Howard Ashman last music he worked on (though he only did 3) which makes it much more memorable. My favorite songs from Aladdin are A whole new world, One jump ahead, and Friend like me.I love the characters in Aladdin. They had a handsome lead(Aladdin), a well developed sidekick (Genie), a spunky princess (Jasmine), and a very good villain (Jafar) as well as a great supporting characters. I love Jasmine shes my favorite Disney princess of ALL time. No one can top her.Aladdin is my personal favorite Disney flick of all time. Though not the best (The lion king is) it will be always be my favorite movie of all time.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Best Disney Film.,"Aladdin is the best of the Disney Films. I love this film and truly consider this one of the best films ever made as well as probably the best animated film I have ever seen.Aladdin is a street rat who must steal in order to make a living. He falls in love with the princess of Agraba, Jasmine. However only a prince can marry a princess. However when the evil sorceress Jafar must use Aladdin to go after a magic lamp, things start to change for Aladdin.Everything about this film is awesome. The artwork is phenomenal, and the music is legendary. ""A Whole New World"" has to be one of the best songs ever in a film.Aladdin is a character whom people can get behind. Everybody loves seeing a rags to riches story and this definitely qualifies and makes it that much more enjoyable.Genie, voiced by Robin Williams, is outstanding beyond belief. Williams performance as a voice actor is so epic that the character of Genie actually acts like Robin WIlliams and uses his style of comedy. I have never seen a voice actor perform a character so well that the voice actor actually makes the character act like them. But this is one of those rare instances. I think that is one of the main reasons why this film stands out and it did start the trend of getting big name actors to do voice over work however no celebrity I believe has done it as well as Robin Williams.Jafar is also a great villain. One of the best of Disney and one that really makes the audience hate him.Frank Welker also gets to star in this film both as Abu and the Cave of WOnders. THat is great because he is my favorite voice actors.The action is phenomenal. Comedy is great. Characters are awesome. Highly recommend this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

one of the best cartoon movie ever made,"This is probably the most unforgettable movie cartoon I have ever seen. The first time I saw this movie was when I was still in elementary (so I was a kiddo). I saw this on a movie theatre in Philippines. The story is really good, the whole movie is really good where the creators really put their best into it. The drawings are amazing, I like it everytime they show an overlook of the city because I can't believe it that someone did that, I mean that's a total different world in that screen. I also used to watch the television show of this, I wake-up every Saturday morning early just to watch it.  Robin Williams did a good job doing a voice for the Genie. It's really funny too. The song ""A Whole New World"", is a really great song to listen to. Lea Salonga did a good job. My favourite part of the movie is when they're singing that song while flying around in a magic carpet. This is the best cartoon movie you'll ever give to your young kids so buy it or rent it, because not only kids will enjoy this but also adults. I am 17 years old now and I still like this cartoon next to 'Lion King' :) I give this movie 10 stars out of 10.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

A great sense of educational!,"This is a film fulling of educational information.Brave, it should be the first, without brave Aladdin cannot play the guardians as fools, he would not bring the lamp out of the hole. Of course, the prince saving the kingdom would not exist.Honest, which is also very indispensable, the second main point in this animation. Abu didn't obey the word and touch a diamond, then they almost died in the hole. Forgetting the promise, Aladdin went to doom and nearly lost everything. Being honest, as the return, it is the forgiveness we see at the end of the story.Contentment, also can be seen from the movie. The fool Jafar failed to learn this, waiting for him is the depriving of freedom the most precious thing to a life.Kindness, which I thought is the first main point showing here makes this film a awesome one. Aladdin is the one who possesses this kind of quality, feeding the street children, making justice for them, saving the princess from blade, and did not be beaten by desire. That is what I thought the most significant quality individual should have.Finally, I want to say, although it is a little bit old animation, please let your children watch it, learn from it, that's the worth of a film like this.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

One of the best Disney movies,"This film tells the story of Aladdin, a vagabond who will use the Genie powers to win the heart of Jasmine, the daughter of the Sultan. Directed by Ron Clements and John Musker, who also ensure the script, it has voice actors as Scott Weinger, Robin Williams and Linda Larkin. With a soundtrack written by Alan Menken, it won two Oscars, for Best Original Song and Best Original Score.This film, visibly inspired by ""Arabian Nights"" and the Islamic ambiance, is one of the best Disney movies before they started opting for computerization. The script is excellent and is based on the classic impossible love of rich girl with the poor guy. Romantic and original, this film was, for many children, the first contact with a love story. It conveys an important moral maxim: love can overcome all barriers and bring people together.The characters are deeply interesting: Aladdin is the typical vagabond of humble origin, who knows survive on the streets but has a good heart. Jasmine is a stubborn princess, full of personality. Jafar, the villain, is the Sultan's minister and only thinks of taking power by the easiest possible way. Genie, the genie of the lamp, is a magical character who can do almost anything. Destined to spend eternity serving those who find him, only grants three wishes and is the largest comic element of the film.The work of designers is excellent, at the level of the best that Disney has ever done. Colorful, with soft but realistic lines, its visually appealing and pleasant. The voice actors did a great job but Robin Williams, who voiced the Genie, deserves a special positive highlight. The soundtrack fulfills her role with great brilliance and stands out over almost the entire film, with musical moments of great quality. One, perhaps the most famous, is ""Arabian Nights"", which comes early in the film. But the most acclaimed by the critic is the song ""A Whole New World"", sung by Aladdin and Jasmine, hoping to discover together the world around them.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
A great comedy,"Aladdin (1992) is one of the finest Hollywood comedies of the 1990s. Not only is it brightly colored, well-animated eye candy, but it's a fun ride, a comic interlude of sorts in-between the grand romance that was Beauty and the Beast (1991) and the epic The Lion King (1994).Some of the pop culture-based gags have dated, but luckily, this classification of joke does not dominate the film. The humor is well-paced and timed, and no matter how many times you see this film, they never grow stale. The voice-acting is top notch and the songs are all memorable, magnificent, and at times, touching.After The Emperor's New Groove (2000), I would say this is the funniest Disney film of them all, certainly among the best of the Disney Renaissance of 1989-1999.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

I love lamp.,"My alphabetical trawl though Disney plus finally lands me on a piece of gold, admittedly, previously seen and often enjoyed gold, but gold, nonetheless. ""Aladdin"" is one of the classic hits from that early 90's golden period that Disney enjoyed, and it really deserves the praise it received.Whilst hustling and stealing on the streets of Agrabah, Aladdin (Scott Weinger) meets Princess Jasmine (Linda Larkin) who is touring the city incognito and falls in love with her. Jafar (Johnathan Freeman) discovers that Aladdin's pure heart makes him the only person who can enter the cave of wonders and retrieve a lamp, that he needs for his evil plans. But with the lamp, and more specifically the genie (Robin Williams) inside Aladdin can also make his dreams for the future come true.I mean, it's a classic in the truest sense of the word. The Animation, coming at the cross over between hand drawn cel animation and CGI work is really great. The songs might be the best collection that any one Disney film has and then there's that performance from Robin Williams and the Genie. A whirling dervish of spontaneous energy, catchphrases and imitations that I don't think anybody else in the history of Hollywood would have the ability to provide. (Evidenced by the ever talented Dan Castellaneta's impression in the sequel). It's a good story too, with a moral centre about eventually learning being true to yourself in light of whatever obstacles are put in your way.Not sure what more can be said, it's fantastic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

A fun Disney adventure with plenty of laughs and solid songs,"This classic Disney film is centred on the eponymous Aladdin, a street urchin in the city of Agrabah. Here he survives by stealing food, along with his monkey, Abu. His life is about to change because of two people from the palace. One is Jafar, the scheming Royal Vizier, who needs a 'diamond in the rough' to retrieve a magical lamp from the 'Cave of Wonders'. The other is Princess Jasmine who must marry in three days but hasn't found a suitable princely suitor. Fed up with the restrictive life in the palace she dresses in peasant clothes and goes into the city, where she meets Aladdin. Events lead to him being captured and forced to enter the Cave of Wonders; here he finds the lamp and releases the genie inside... it offers him three wishes. There are a few catches so Aladdin must use the wishes wisely... he must also avoid Jafar who wants the genie's power.I really enjoyed this Disney animation. The story provides a fine mix of thrills, romance, comedy and solid songs. Aladdin himself is a likeable male lead and Jasmine is a good female lead. Jafar is a great villain, menacing without being too scary for younger viewers. However it is the genie, voiced by the Robin Williams on great form, who steals the show whenever he is on screen. As one would expect the animation is of a high quality; with 2D characters impressively immersed in 3D scenes. The songs are so good you'll likely find yourself humming them afterwards. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of quality animation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

One of my Favorite Movies of All Time,"Maybe it's just because I have a serious case of ADHD, but I LOVE this movie. I love everything it has in it. I love the animation. I love Jafar's slimy personality. I love how annoying Gilbert Goddfried was as Iago. I love the chemistry between Princess Jasmine and Aladdin. I love how much personality Frank Welker brought to Abu with zero dialog. And I absolutely LOVE Robin Williams as the Genie. I think he's the best celebrity casting choice since they got Vincent Price to play Ratigan in The Great Mouse Detective (great movie, by the way).The story isn't that original, but let's face it, no one watched Aladdin for the story. They watched it for all that stuff I mentioned. And even though they added a lot of pop cultural references to the Genie's dialog that are a bit dated, you really don't need to know what they're referencing to enjoy the character. The Rocky Balboa reference in ""Friend Like Me"" doesn't detract from the song, neither does Williams' impersonation of Jack Nicholson when he's trying to talk Aladdin into telling Jasmine the truth about himself. They're just there long enough so that if you get them, you will, and if you don't get them, you won't mind, because the Genie's just such an enjoyable character.Give this film a watch if you haven't already.

So as I said before today he may not and should not have been cast but he was and left this gem. Only RW could represent Genie like this in such a comedic way but with such passion and love. It is likely the best voice over work ever performed in an animated movie. It will go down as his crowning gem outside live action films such as Dead Poets Society and Good Will Hunting.

The OG Aladdin,"Robin Williams as the genie is perfection. Don't get me wrong, the rest of this is great too but the genie is HIS role without contest. The only real negative I have for this movie is the early 90's racism that was pretty much just accepted back then but isn't cool now.It's Aladdin though. It's a classic. The only good thing about the live action one coming out is that maybe more people will go back and watch this.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Arabian Nights,"Aladdin is one character I've grown up watching & enjoying when its TV show used to air and it was one of my favourite cartoon series. But only later did I find out that it was the feature film from Disney that started it all. So, there's no doubt that I approached the film with high expectations & yet it managed to deliver on such excellence note that it was a straight shot into my favourite animation films & is one of the finest features to come out from the Disney Renaissance Era.Set in a fictional sultanate of Agrabah, the film tells the story of Aladdin; a street urchin making his living by stealing foods with his pet monkey named Abu. One day, he accidentally bumps into Princess Jasmine who's disguised as a local civilian, the two fall in love but Jasmine can only marry a prince according to the law. Aladdin soon finds himself arrested & involved in Jafar's (Sultan's attorney) evil plan to retrieve an ancient mysterious oil lamp but the plan goes for a toss when Aladdin unravels the secret about the lamp earlier.The entire sultanate of Agrabah is beautifully drawn & it looks gorgeous on screen. Every character is wonderfully fleshed out from Aladdin, Jasmine, Abu, Genie, Jafar n others & each one has a vital role to play here but my favourite amongst all was Iago; Jafar's sarcastic, foul- mouthed pet parrot, who was an absolute show-stealer. The beautiful Arabian-themed music & truly enchanting songs also make a strong contribution to the story plus the opening song that commences the film couldn't have done so on a more imposing note.More than 2 decades have passed since Aladdin first came out but it still hasn't aged a day. It remains as fresh as it did the first time I watched it & is as impressive a story as it is nostalgic for me. On an overall scale, Aladdin is one of the finest animation films from Disney that scores high on all filmmaking aspects & is full of interesting, intriguing characters whom you just can't hate. Although I feel that almost everyone has seen it but in case you haven't, then do yourself a favour & go check it out.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
A Dazzling Place of Wonders,"Aladdin is such a fantastic, energetic, exciting, romantic film. The characters are all very lovable and zany in their own fashion (especially Genie).
The 2 main reasons I love this film are, 1: Aladdin's arch in this film is very intriguing. He goes through the journey of changing who he is to impress someone, but finds out that she preferred the unfiltered Aladdin, not Prince Ali. This is not only a great message to children, but also a very compelling journey to be a part of.
And 2: The Genie is Excellent! He is so jumpy and hilarious. He might actually be my favorite Disney character. No other person than Robbin Williams could have made him who he is.
My one complaint with this film, is that Aladdin and Jasmine fell in love with each other after being together for one day. I know it's a love at first site kinda thing, but if they gave more time to develop their relationship, then there would be a lot more hard-hitting moments in the film.
Also this film has A Whole New World. Do I even need to explain?",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Disney + Robin Williams = Timeless classic,"The US-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee protested over the pro-Western display of Aladdin and Jasmine, who is always without a veil, over the fact that all the characters with the turban are bald, and that all the villains are caricatured personifications of prejudices about the Arabs. But the fiercest protests were caused by a verse from the song ""Arabian Nights,"" which opens the cartoon. The verse now reads ""Where it's flat and immense and the heat is intense, it's barbaric, but, hey, it's home"". In the original version, the verse read ""Where they cut off your ears if they don't like your face, it's barbaric, but, hey, it's home"". This provoked such an alarm that the film was placed among the most controversial achievements of all time.Personally, I find this information quite interesting, but totally irrelevant, because the animation is excellent, the music is beautiful, the story is quite solid, and the film that stars Robin Williams by default can not fail.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

familiar but fun,"Enjoyable animated feature about a kindhearted young street hustler who discovers a magic lamp that releases a hyperactive, jocular blue genie who agrees to grant him three wishes. Naturally he wants to transcend his dismal existence, but more importantly he wants to win the affections of the princess, which is easier said than done.

"""Let's make some magic!"" with Robin Williams","The amazing voice work and comedy of Robin Williams and Gilbert Gottfried ... does it get any better than that?All the songs are amazing but the magic the Genie brings to 'Friend Like Me' and 'Prince Ali' are what make them really special. I remember how Disney at the time was showing off how they used a combination of hand drawn animation and CGI together for the first time, to bring the cave of wonders sequence to life and it still holds up.I was the perfect age for the start of the Disney renissance, and while the 'Little Mermaid' and 'Beauty and The Beast' felt like girly movies at the time, Aladdin was a film that had the action, adventure, and comedy that truly captured my imagination as a kid.Aladdin and Jasmine are great, but the side characters are what really make it shine with all the spunk that Abu, Carpet, Genie, and Iago bring to the mix.

Inspired Robin Williams in Disney classic,"Disney's Aladdin is a charming animated classic with an inspired manic performance by Robin Williams. This is probably Williams's best voice-work after 'Good Morning Vietnam'. Here he is matched by the remarkably fluid animation. The film is compact and there are no dull segments though Scott Weinger and Linda Larkin are a bit bland as Aladdin and Jasmine. Jonathan Freeman is suitably menacing as the scheming Jafar while Gilbert Gottfried makes a memorable sidekick. There are two great musical numbers, ""Friend Like Me"" and ""Prince Ali"", both with some dizzying animation. Worth watching.Overall 8/10",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Disney at it's Best,"Aladdin (1992) earns a resounding 10/10 stars, standing as a timeless masterpiece in the world of animation.First and foremost, Robin Williams as the Genie is an absolute tour de force. His voice work is nothing short of legendary, infusing the character with boundless energy, wit, and humor. Williams' improvisational brilliance adds a layer of spontaneity that makes the Genie an unforgettable and iconic presence. The character's larger-than-life personality, fueled by Williams' comedic genius, steals every scene and leaves an indelible mark on the film's legacy.Aladdin, portrayed with charm and likability, becomes a relatable hero. His journey from a ""diamond in the rough"" street rat to a prince captures hearts with its authenticity and dreams that resonate across generations. The character's endearing qualities make the audience emotionally invested in his quest for love and self-discovery.The soundtrack, composed by the talented Alan Menken, is a true masterpiece in its own right. The musical numbers, including the enchanting ""A Whole New World,"" the exuberant ""Friend Like Me,"" and the grandiose ""Prince Ali,"" are not merely songs but pivotal moments that elevate the storytelling. The synergy between animation and music creates an immersive experience, leaving an everlasting impact on viewers.The vibrant animation, filled with rich colors and intricate details, brings the city of Agrabah to life. The magic carpet ride sequence, set against the backdrop of ""A Whole New World,"" is a visual spectacle that showcases the film's artistic brilliance.Beyond its visual and auditory delights, Aladdin imparts profound life lessons about love, friendship, and staying true to oneself. These themes, coupled with the dynamic characters and compelling narrative, make it a film that transcends the boundaries of age and time.This animated classic remains a shining example of storytelling and animation mastery, leaving an enduring legacy that continues to captivate audiences worldwide.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
My favorite Disney Animation,"I'm from the generation of kids that got to be the focal point of Disneys animation come back in the late 80's. Like every little girl at that time the Little Mermaid was my favorite-that is until 1992 rolled around and Aladdin came out.Just watched this movie for the first time in several decades.The music is still great, the whole Arabian setting is was a nice change for Disney in 1992, and it was when Disney started using computer graphics in the their animated movies.Of course Genie is the best, an unforgettable character, done impeccably by Robin Williams. The movie would have not been what it is without Genie. Despite that Genie doesn't show up until about 30 minutes in, the movie is still great.Next to Genie, Lago done by Gilbert Godfried, is hilarious. Every scene with that parrot is great and still cracks me up today. Compared to all other animation not including Pixar Aladdin reigns supreme.Disney has a great talent for killing off a character anyone can relate to and in such a heartbreaking way that it brings tears to even the sternest eyes. Aladdin is one of the rare gems where this does not happen.At 40, still my favorite.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
The most popular adaptation of One Thousand And One Nights,"Aladdin is the most popular story in the One Thousand And One Nights book, with an origin so ancient that the story has varied in different ways like many traditional stories. Disney tells its own version of the story with this animated film that takes a few elements from The Thief Of Bagdad. Like many animated films that Disney produced, this film is visually masterful. It cannot be denied that of many adaptations that have been made of the Aladdin story, this film is the most popular version. It has very good characters with the protagonist being the young and cunning Aladdin who dreams big, but as he is close to reaching his goal, he learns that it is not always good to try to pretend to be someone he is not. Jasmine is one of the princess models of that time who only wants to marry for love and not out of family obligation. Jafar is an eccentric and elegant antagonist who has much of what has characterized Disney villains. The genie of the lamp is a charismatic character who steals much of the film with that comic personality that Robin Williams has given him. Maybe making him too cartoonish makes the genie turn the film into a kind of parody, but it gives him quite a bit of charm. The songs are not far behind and although there are not many, the rhythm of all of them is difficult to forget. It is curious that the main song, Arabian Nights, is a reference to the second title of the One Thousand and One Nights book in the English version. Of course, when it comes to the songs, A Whole New World is the icing on the cake, like most of the romantic songs that Disney animated films have had. Aladdin is not just another great Disney animated film, it is thanks to this film that the story of Aladdin was able to prevail for many years and make some dare to find out what other adventures exist in The Arabian Nights. My final rating for this movie is a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Review for Aladdin,"This was a staple of my childhood along with my sister's. I remember when this movie came out. We got the VHS soon after and watched it on repeat along with its sequel. This was one of my favorites from that era. Jaime, my wife, put this one to see if we could get our daughter, Mackenzie, to watch this. She would get hooked when certain songs came on, but at the moment she doesn't have the attention span.What I'll say is that I still have fond memories of this movie. We had this video game on Sega Genesis so certain levels popped up to me while watching this. What I didn't realize though until being a bit older and no longer a child is that this is loosely based on Arabian Nights. We get that classic Disney idea about a princess, Jasmine (voiced by Linda Larkin), who is independent, but being forced to marry. Her father, the sultan who is voiced by Douglas Seale, needs her to marry and he parades different princes in due to the law. What they don't realize is that the royal vizier, Jafer (voiced by Jonathan Freeman), is manipulated things.This also includes a young thief named Aladdin (voiced by Scott Weinger). He is needed to go into the Cave of Wonders to get the ultimate treasure, a lamp that harbors a powerful genie. This great magical creature voiced by Robin Williams. Aladdin has tricks up his sleeves along with his monkey, Abu (voiced by the great Frank Welker).Now I didn't realize the backlash about this film until this rewatch. There were stylistic choices where certain characters have more Angelo-Saxon features due to being heroes like Aladdin, Jasmine and the sultan while villains like Jafer and the guards look more like people from the Middle East, just pushed to be more villainous. I get the argument and them raising their case for sure.What I'll say is that the animation here is great. Streaming this in 4K helped to enhance things that even looked impressive back on VHS. This to me is a classic with the visuals. There are iconic songs here that still hold up to me. I would love to hear the different things that Williams said that didn't make the cut, because he is the true gem here along with Jafer and his pet bird lago (voiced by Gilbert Gottfried). I still love this and would recommend it if you haven't seen it or it's been a while. This is made for kids so keep that in mind.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

animated film-making at it's finest,"This movie is amazing. i haven't seen it since i was a kid. i watched the live-action remake and while i was disappointed (5/10), i realized that the story was really good. so i decided to give the original another try. and i was so completely impressed.the movie is very funny, especially robin williams' performance. abu also cracked me up. the story is great. and the movie made me feel emotions throughout. happy, sad, anxious, triumphant, etc.but the thing that made this movie work so well with me was the music. i generally dislike musicals. it's the reason i haven't gone back to most older disney animated movies. but man oh man. every single song in this movie is awesome. they were giving me goosebumps. maybe partly due to the nostalgia, but mostly due to them being beastly.there were also a bunch of really creative parts with the animation and certain action sequences. so many memorable scenes. and it felt so fast paced, with major plot points almost constantly. i was fully into the movie and didn't really feel time lol (about 6 viewings, 5/16/2020)",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Another gem in an already glittering (although swiftly tarnishing) crown,"Ranking even above the classic Little Mermaid, but not quite level with the enchantment of Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin came around when Disney was still breaking in it's new, smoother animation process, and it came with a splash of typical Disney glory.Aladdin is a wonderful movie, handling an old story with a new twist and fresh sense of humour. The casting is well done, though there is a distinct lack of accents in the main characters (perhaps merely for understanding purposes. Arabic accents are difficult to decipher sometimes).Despite all the action, adventure and romance in this gem of a family film, there is one thing that sets it again apart from the rest...the music. The score in this film is one of the better I have heard, it is quite beautiful, especially the various love ballads. Only one Disney film in my opinion can top this with an entire score (others can maybe top one or two songs, but not the entire school) and that is Beauty and the Beast, which stands, in my opinion in a musical class of it's own which has yet to be topped by any Disney movie past or present.Overall, Aladdin is a wonderful family experience with elements that can appeal to everyone that will live on with a select others rather than fading into the abyss.  However, one word of advice, avoid the sequels at all costs...they are a waste of film degrading to the original classic.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

A Very Good Animated Film,"I saw Aladdin on TV. I hope they did not cut much out. Hopefully, none. I think the best part of the movie is the genie. Robin Williams is the voice and really. A lot of the comical, maniac behavior seems to be taken from his personality. But the genie isn't the only good thing about Aladdin. The diabolical bad guy, Jafar, is also very good, that is, he's good at being very bad. I'll bet a lot of viewers enjoyed Jafar's parrot, voiced by Gilbert Gottfried. To be honest, he kind of annoyed me. On the other hand, Princess Jasmine may have been the most attractive animated female Disney character since Sleeping Beauty.The storyline was pretty simple. The young princess hates the fact that she has no control over her life. One day she flees the palace to get a taste of real live. She doesn't realize that items have to be purchased and not just picked up and carried away. And that's where the trouble begins. But a young man, Aladdin, living on the streets, comes to her rescue. A short while later, the magic lamp is discovered. As for the story, I'll stop there.Anyhow, Aladdin is a very good movie, if someone were to claim that it rivaled any of the past Disney classic animated features, I don't think I'd put up much of an argument. That's pretty high praise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
It's a perfect movie.,"The story is good and the pace is high. ""Aladdin"" is not too short and it's not too long, it's not too immature and it's not too mature, it's a perfect movie for the entire family with a wonderful love story (even though it's no ""Beauty and the Beast"") and good animations with some good looking early computer effects. The songs and music in general are just great and very memorable. Jafar is a great villain mainly because he is voiced by Jonathan Freeman who has got a good and scary voice. But what is maybe the best element of the movie is Robin Williams as the blue genie. The blue genie is like a jokemachine that once it is started can't stop again and keeps you laughing.Without all those jokes - and the great visuals that go with those gags (things popping up like Saturday morning cartoons), this would just be a routine Disney animated film. Part of the normal Disney fare includes a hero who is a good guy but a liar and a heroine who is the typical wasp-waisted beauty who is rebellious against the rules of the day. The villain is an ""Oil Can Harry"" mustached dastardly employee of the king who desires king-like powers. His scenes, however, are tempered with humor thanks to his New York City-sounding obnoxious parrot, who provides most of the movie's slapstick humor.
Iago is the funniest character of this movie, along with the Genie. Nobody better than Gilbert Gottfried to voice the sarcastic parrot. Iago is simply hilarious! He's rude, grumpy, sarcastic, hungry for power, malicious, obnoxious and foul-tempered. He has an irritating voice but in a funny way, as well as a great talent to perfectly mimic other characters's voices. However, deep down inside he has a heart. I also love his hate for crackers. I don't see why does he hates crackers so much, but that also makes him so funny! Besides, a parrot with teeth?? lol!By the way, I absolutely love the song ""A Whole New World"". The version sung by Aladdin and Jasmine is great, but the original version of Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle is better, deeper and more romantic and classic. It's a very romantic and joyful song, which is always a pleasure to listen. ""Arabian Nights"" is a nice song as well...A person pf pure spirit is the only one who can grab a mystical lamp which is the heart of his plan. When things go wrong for Jafar (thanks to that quick monkey) Aladdin discovers the secret of the lamp and the comic hilarity that lay inside. Aladdin gets three wishes from the *ahem* Genie in the bottle (voiced by the perfectly cast Robin Williams) and Al's life will never be the same. Will Aladdin fulfill his deepest desires or will he rescue the princess and take a magic carpet ride into the sunset? ""Aladdin"" is a beautiful melding of computer generated and standard animation that paved the way for Disney's best feature (The Lion King).

Excellent entertainment,"With Aladdin, Disney continued it's hot streak after The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast were amazing box office successes in every sense. And while Aladdin was less inspiring than those two, Robin Williams' magical touch made the movie 1992's most successful film and a top-seller at video sales. It is not that something in Aladdin is not on a par with its two predecessors, it is just that it wasn't as fresh and magical. It's not that the animation was better, nor the songs, and the characters weren't on a par with the first two, but inspite of it, Aladdin remains a winner all the way. Thanks for the animation (don't misunderstand from what I wrote, the animation is definitely on a par with Mermaid and Beauty), the award-winning songs and the sophisticated humor.

you never had a friend like me,"Aladdin is a Disney cartoon with a character that we all wish we had as friend, the genie. Aladdin is filled with endless thrills, table turning plans and music that you can't help to like and sing along to. The movie's intro is in form of a narrative, where a merchant tells us the tale of Aladdin and his magic lamp.This 1992 Disney classic is based on an Arab folktale of Aladdin and the magic lamp from One Thousand and One Nights. The idea to make the movie was pitched in by the Late Howard Ashman (who died before the film's release) Ashman has been behind a lot of Disney classics from Oliver & Company, Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast. He was a writer, lyricist and producer and he was the lyricist for ""Arabian Nights"", ""Friend Like Me"", and ""Prince Ali"" used in this movie.Aladdin's story is about a street boy, who runs into a princess named Jasmine who escaped the palace to see what life was outside the palace walls where you are not told what to do. While they were together Aladdin gets captured by soldiers under the orders of Jafar, the Grand Vizier to the Sultan of Agrabah (Jasmine's father).Jafar needs Aladdin to retrieve a magical oil lamp containing a genie from the Cave of Wonders.The movie's story now grows on what happened when Jafar didn't get the lamp but Aladdin did in an attempt to read the inscriptions on the lamp, released the genie and he is given 3 wishes.As the song goes, you never had a friend like me So it has been, because all through Disney toon history we never found anyone more appealing to have around, Genie is just the best person to have in at corner.The movie's screenplay explores fantasy, world travel, fireworks and action scenes.Aladdin was a box office hit, making over $ 500 million dollars in its theatrical run and also gave birth to two direct to DVD sequels and a TV series. Aladdin won numerous awards, especially for its music, it won only two Academy Awards, Best Original Score and Best Original Song for ""A Whole New World"" and it also won four Grammy Awards, Best Soundtrack Album, Song of the Year for ""A Whole New World"", Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for ""A Whole New World"" and Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media for ""A Whole New World"".Like it or not, Aladdin boast of the best of the best music, and it was also funny and fun to watch, so if you don't own this DVD you Disney collection is not complete yet.www.lagsreviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
A must-watch for all,"Robin Williams - that's all that really needs to be said.1992's 'Aladdin' is simply outstanding! There's so much which is great about it, but it is Mr. Williams who elevates the film up a notch. He is hilarious in the role of Genie, every joke lands thanks to his impeccable delivery - the animation plays a huge part also, so credit to those behind the scenes.Away from him, you still have numerous pluses. Scott Weinger and Linda Larkin are good as Aladdin and Jasmine, but Jonathan Freeman steals the show under Williams with a top notch display as Jafar. Gilbert Gottfried also brings the laughs as Iago. A terrific bunch of characters.The premise is fascinating, with the ending enthralling to watch. Alan Menken's music is utterly superb, with a whole collection of amazing songs - my standouts being ""Prince Ali"" and ""One Jump Ahead"".I enjoy the 2019 live-action film, but there's simply no beating this original.

A masterpiece like this one should be put on DVD immediately. Plus, Aladdin was soooo cute (for a cartoon) I wanted to be Princess Jasmine so badly.*****/*****",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

A Disney Classic,"I had heard a lot of good things about this film. The film, animation, storyline, and musical number were all hyped up.It was a great movie, to say the least. I do think some of the songs were quite a bit cheesy and so was the animation. Both of these things come with the time period in which the film was made. There were a few times that the animation did not match what was happening. For example, the character's mouth or eyes would not match the audio/ visual. On a more positive side, the songs were really good and catchy, even with them being cheesy. I loved the plot, it really drew me in as a viewer. I enjoyed my time watching this absolute Disney classic!",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Walt Disney's classic masterpiece.,"Aladdin is exciting, like Raiders of the Lost Ark as a cartoon or at least another Indiana Jones epic. The musical-comedy is about a poor man named Aladdin, who's only friend is a monkey named Abu. Suddenly, they enter the Cave of Wonders with the villainous Jafar dressing in disguise. Then, when Aladdin and Abu got locked up with the lamp in the Cave of Wonders, Aladdin ends up reviving and reawakening the Genie (voiced by Robin Williams), who's character is extremely enthusiastic and entertaining for kids and adults, too. Later, Aladdin doesn't appear to be poor because of the Genie and tries payback from Jafar and his parrot Iago.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Genie grants three wishes,"Aladdin is about a young Middle Eastern homeless guy living on the dusty streets of Agrabah. Aladdin, the main character, owns a monkey named Abu. Early in the movie, he, by chance, ends up meeting the princess, Jasmine, who is in disguise because she wants to get out of the palace where she lives and experience life on the outside in the real world. She doesn't like it in the palace because it is confining and she is not able to make her own choices. For example, she must find a husband by her next birthday per the local law. While they are hanging out, Aladdin is arrested for stealing bread from earlier. He is taken to the dungeon. Her pleas to let him go fall on empty ears because the palace guards are under the orders of Jafar, an evil sorcerer who works for the King, Jasmine's father. They do not disclose to him or to her whether they are there specifically to arrest him. Later, while Aladdin is in shackles, Jafar sneaks into his cell disguised as an old peasant donning a gold tooth and hobbling around on a wooden cane that looks like a giant corkscrew. In exchange for Aladdin's assistance in finding treasure, this magic lamp, Jafar says that he will help Aladdin escape. He begrudgingly agrees. What else is he supposed to do?! Aladdin goes with the disguised Jafar to Cave of Wonders where, inside, he finds the lamp.

Great Disney movie.,"What a great movie. It is at this point one of the best Disney animations, one of those where the important thing is the story and the characters and not the preponderance of technology. With a story inspired by the Thousand and One Nights, we have a nice thief who, in the company of his pet, tries to conquer an unattainable love while facing colossal challenges. There are moments for emotion, for surprise and hilarity. His script is perfect and both his original voices and the Spanish adaptation are top notch.

Robin,"""Aladdin"" from Disney is a good movie to watch. Made in 1992, it does age a little by todays standard, but, this film would not have been such a success if it were not for the, late, great Robin Williams. His voice/character really steal the show.

The jokes that Williams was able to bring to the film was hands down, one of..if not the best, performance in a Disney film to date.

Entirely entertaining 25 years later,"Aladdin is a thoroughly entertaining film, with the theme of being ""trapped"" resonant across all demographics. This is probably the funniest Disney film of the '90s, with a large part of that owing to Robin Williams' ostentatious genie. The incessant references might date the film a little--in fact, I believe Aladdin may be the first children's animation showcasing the trend of gratuitous pop culture references for the sake of a knowing laugh--But I digress, for the movie does manage to find comedy in other places too. Jafar, for example, is probably the perfect Disney villain: sarcastic, maleficent, and creepy as all hell. He inspires most of the action scenes, which are exhilarating and suspenseful mostly because they have a sense of real urgency; Aladdin doesn't just slip out without having a few (or 10) close calls. Many people have complained about Jasmine and Aladdin being bland stock characters, but I don't see that, especially for Jasmine. She was probably the most autonomous Disney princess at the time, and she has grace and charm without being simpering and dependent. All of the characters here are entertaining; even the notoriously grating Gilbert Gottfried as Iago garners quite a few laughs.The two leads have a palpable chemistry, and are given a classic ballad to develop their relationship (""A Whole New World"" is the best song here), but given Jasmine's obstinacy, could have been given a little bit more time to grow realistically, in my opinion. The short duration of the wooing doesn't impede our ability to see the characters having a happily ever after, though. The ending is saccharine, with the villain getting an ingenious comeuppance and everyone getting their dream's fulfillment, including the Genie, in a surprising show of compassion for a movie that largely focuses on making one's own dreams come true.The music is also witty and exciting, but isn't as eloquent or stirring as Beauty and the Beast's soundtrack. However, Aladdin's engaging action, characters, and story more than make up for this. Aladdin is a classic tale that'll make you laugh and gasp (it's too sweet of a film to elicit a full on cry), and it definitely deserves a place in the Disney hall of fame (or your movie collection).",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Aladdin,"It has strikingly dazzling animation that looks really colorful and flows very well. The character designs are not just amazing, but also well-detailed and creative. But this is to be expected from Disney films. Especially considering how this wasn't just a Disney movie, but also a movie released during their Renaissance Era.Great cast of characters like Aladdin (the main hero, a rowdy and strong-willed street rat), Jasmine (a rebellious princess who seeks to escape being forced into marriage) and the Genie (a comic relief who was so funny and iconic that he ended up inspiring an entire generation of comic reliefs in film, although some of which ended up as pointless to the plots of their movies and just very unfunny in general, unfortunately).Aladdin's character development is great. As he starts off as being more than willing to steal from (although given his status as a street rat, it was mainly understandable) or even lie to others. By the end film, he's really grown into a man worthy of being Sultan. Although this is best seen in King of Thieves. As after going to break his father out of prison, Aladdin returns ready and willing to accept any sort of punishment he might receive, because he actually realizes how much his habits of running away would affect Jasmine due to him now fully understanding how greatly his own father's abandonment of his family affected him. Aladdin has learned that his actions can and do affect other people, a lesson some people would say more rulers need to learn.Awesome songs including ""A Whole New World"" (the love song between Aladdin and Jasmine as the former takes the princess on a magic carpet ride), ""Friend Like Me"" (the Genie's song to Aladdin featuring him fulling showcasing his powers to Aladdin), ""One Jump Ahead"" (which has Aladdin steal a loaf of bread and get chased down by Razoul and his men), and ""Prince Ali"" (a song centered around Prince Ali, Aladdin alter-ego after he wished to be a prince).Aladdin uses his wits to save the day and defeat Jafar rather than brawn, which is vastly original and clever. Especially considering that many Disney movies being released at the time, while nonetheless good, more often than not relied on action or fast-paced battle sequences in order to take down the film's main antagonist. But here, it isn't the case. It's all the more remarkable given how much action there had been previously in the film and the fact that Aladdin is such an reckless and abrasive character, which would only raise assumptions that the final battle to take down Jafar would be some high-staked final battle rather than Aladdin actually using their intelligence to defeat the villain.Amazing voice acting from Scott Weinger, Linda Larkin, and of course, Robin Wiliams (as Aladdin, Jasmine, and the Genie respectively). Although this is another aspect to be expected from Disney films (let alone Disney renaissance films).The action scenes are cool, such the carpet ride scene in the Cave of Wonders.Spot-on and highly hilarious humor, for the most part.The film has some nods to the 1940 film The Thief of Baghdad.Jafar is a pretty nasty villain as he aims to take the magic lamp in order to overthrow the Sultan of Agrabah and marry Princess Jasmine and proves that he's willing to do some absolutely despicable things to do so. And in the end, he uses his third and final wish to become an all-powerful genie (and it actually worked, given briefly before he was sealed into the lamp) It's also worth noting how Jonathan Freeman did a great job doing the voice of him.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Some of the songs are bangers,"It was quite interesting to watch this movie after watching the first seven or so Disney feature films - this is a film that grabs you from the beginning and holds your attention until the end. The opening number Arabian Nights sets up the story perfectly. It's a tune that really sticks in your head, which is true of the other great number, prince Ali. The plot is really well paced and there's no slow moments in the film, characters really work well together and all of their motivations are clear. It's clear by this time, Disney Studios had the financial resources to put money into the production of its films, and they were the best at what they did when this film was released. Obviously, I enjoyed the film, but I think there are parts that just didn't hold up. The first time I watched it I thought Robin Williams's performance as the genie was hilarious, but it contains a lot of references that audiences, today would have trouble understanding. For example, there's a reference to Ed Sullivan and Rodney Dangerfield. My kids did not understand these references at all - but what they really found funny was the character of Iago. I have to say that makes sense because the comedy connected to this character is more timeless - it's basically an irritable old man - and everyone knows at least one of those. The animation at times is clearly CGI from the era, and it looks dated. There is also the fact that the evil characters are portrayed in a more stereotypically Arab way whereas the main characters are portrayed in a more stereotypically American way, even though these characters live in the same area. I think this is mostly in regard to the character of Jafar, who was designed independently of the rest of the characters and resembles what a human version of Scar from The Lion King would look like. So that's a bit racist - but it's not racist in the same way Song of the South is racist. It's racist in a way that all the people who created this movie are not from this culture, and you're making a movie about characters that are from this culture, so you're applying your kind of own standards of what is good and bad and what looks good and bad. The other thing is that because the movie flows along so quickly the main characters meet and fall in love within about 2 minutes which is a little bit unrealistic, but I prefer that than a slow paced movie. The characters of Aladdin and Jasmine are also interesting, there's real character development there. Jasmine gets to make choices, and she's portrayed as being a real person. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see the best of Disney.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Viewing a classic in the light of 2004,"I saw this movie and loved it when it was released, but when my family and I sat down to watch the 2004 DVD release last night, it was interesting to view this movie in the light of 2004.The movie itself is good frenetic fun -- very fast-paced, due in large part to Robin Williams' ADD-afflicted Genie. The one-liners and pop culture references fly so fast it's hard to keep on top of them. Still, my kids liked the music and the quick tempo of the movie. I could do without the love ballad ""A Whole New World."" Sounds too dated Disney saccharine these days.What added a strange sort of twist to the movie was viewing it for the first time in a post-9/11 world. The two primary male characters, Aladdin and Jafar, have distinctly Semitic sidekicks (Gilbert Gottfried as the parrot and the Genie himself, whose delivery is frequently borscht-flavored). Ironic, that. Also, there are quite a lot of references to beheading, and that gave me the heebie-jeebies.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
I remember why I love Disney musicals,"Returning to childhood is one nice once in a while. And when it's actually good. It's a bonus and when the music is slapping like this, then It's just amazing.The movie has such a good pacing to it. It just keeps moving that hour in half just flies by and it's just music behind Every Corner and fun scene the characters dialogue is really good. I just enjoyed all of it and return to childhood.And the Disney animations looks gorgeous the Shadows the shading the coloring the backgrounds it all just looks so marvelous and beautiful. I'm so saddened that this kind of Disney animation is lost, but at least I can appreciatemusic just pop. It is so good party music. It's so catchy I'm still having it in my head. I heard it as a child and now when I have watched its an adult. I will keep have it in my head. It will never leave because it's just so goddam catchy.Aladdin is a nice sweet wet that wants to become more the princess that want to leave the Casualty of known all her life and sexy alpha male Jafar just touching his spear and being the most amazing and sexy villanov seen in a while. I will say that he was the thing I enjoyed the most just seeing him on screen almost made me wet myself.Guinness comedy was just so on but sadly some of the jokes are so old that he was using that I was taking out of them because I was just thinking why are you using it joke from the 60s in this child movie? It's just weird sometimes, but it goes by so fast that it's hard to complain.I think this is now on my top three Disney movies and would recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

One of the best movies ever made,"I love it. Everything's just perfect - not in terms of that synthetic, overworked, exhausting techno-perfection, but the way a genuine, slightly flawed but totally well-intended, sincere work of art should be.This was made shortly before computers took over the final outcomes of animation cinema, so it has the delicacy of ""hand made"" artifacts, which makes it even more precious.I have no idea why Disney+ is showing this with a disclaimer put before, talking about stereotypes whatnot. I see nothing problematic here. Maybe the abundance of Indian fakirs was somewhat distracting or misleading for a story set in Arabia but who cares.This movie is about pure love. The kind of love you can find only once in a lifetime. As the couple sings ""A Whole New World"", you get to experience how that feeling or romance breaks down all your past boundaries and opens you up to a whole new, inner world.I salute every single person who has worked on this.

Another Disney masterpiece,"Aladdin is a Disney Renaissance-era classic that I have watched many times, and I still remember the first time I watched it on DVD at the Variety Club back in 2008, when I was about 5. Saying that it was my #1 favorite Disney animated flick growing up would be lying, since that was Beauty and the Beast. Even so, I love Aladdin for many reasons.The animation, first of all, is MAGNIFICENT. The characters are all excellently designed, and rich with expression and smooth movements. The effects animation is likewise remarkable, especially on the Magic Carpet, what with his elaborate, intricate design. You really can't tell he was animated with CGI! And all the backgrounds are lush and vibrant, from the street scenes of Agrabah, to the wide exterior shots of the palace. And thanks to Disney's proprietary CAPS system, everything blends together beautifully.In regards to the characters, they're all so appealing in their own ways. Aladdin (voiced by Scott Weinger in the speaking part, Brad Kane in the singing part) is a young man who lives on the street with his monkey, Abu (Frank Welker, the king of animal sounds), and lives off of food he steals from vendors. He's very smart, sly and resourceful, along with being very kind, thoughtful and generous (such as giving some starving, homeless children some bread that he stole). As for Abu, he's a cunning, thieving little lump of fur, but he's got a good heart about him, and he's very loyal. In regards to Jasmine, the Princess of Agrabah (Linda Larkin in the speaking part, Lea Salonga in the singing part), she's a firm, headstrong young lady who wishes to be free to make her own choices in life. Her father, the Sultan (Douglas Seale), is good-natured, but naïve, and simply wants to find his daughter a suitor. Jafar (Jonathan Freeman), the royal vizier, who wants to usurp the throne and have power, is a classic and devilishly charming villain. His mouthy parrot, Iago (voiced by AND based on Gilbert Gottfried, may he rest in peace, even having teeth), is sardonic, witty and hot-tempered to a very entertaining extent. But the best character in the entire movie is THE GENIE (Robin Williams)! He's the character that makes this entire movie work, and not just by his remarkable powers, but by his hilarious impressions and zany antics (some of which involve anachronisms).The voice-acting is absolutely perfect. Everybody is suited magnificently to their roles. Scott Weinger gives Aladdin the perfect male lead voice, and does a great job of cementing his charm. Linda Larkin infuses Jasmine with feistiness. Jonathan Freeman gives Jafar a delightfully evil-sounding British-accented voice (though what is it with some villains being British?). But again, the best vocal performance in the movie is by Robin Williams, America's king of comedy (may he rest in piece, as I mentioned in my review for Jumanji), who absolutely threw himself into the role of the Genie, giving him all sorts of funny voices, and even nailing the more serious parts (with the latter being just like he did in Jumanji).In regards to the music: Of course, this is a Disney Renaissance-era flick, so expect quality music. Musical genius and Disney legend Alan Menken, as always, delivered a truly masterful score, and it really sells that Middle Eastern feel of the movie. And the songs, which he cowrote with his Little Mermaid collaborator, the late, great lyricist Howard Ashman (sadly his final work before his death) and incredible lyricist Tim Rice, are also excellent. ""A Whole New World"", Aladdin and Jasmine's duet, is absolutely exquisite, in terms of how it's written and sung. Brad Kane and Lea Salonga definitely had the time of their lives singing it. But me and my brother's personal favorite is the Genie's big solo, ""Friend Like Me"", which is very fun.The script and dialogue are also top-notch, and do a great job of establishing Aladdin as a diamond-in-the-rough protagonist, and Jasmine wanting more out of life. This movie also has a great balance of drama and levity, bringing great humor in when things are getting way too intense.All in all, Aladdin is a sublime Disney classic, and definitely top-tier Disney. I rank it right up there with The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast as one of the best of the Disney Renaissance.

Absolutely marvelous animation film,"""Aladdin"" (1992) to me is one of Disney Motion Pictures' crowning achievements. First of all, the adapted screenplay is well written, and it has absolutely perfect pacing with interesting character introductions and arcs all around.Furthermore, the film looks absolutely gorgeous, filled with vibrant and warm colour palettes, beautiful portrayals of middle eastern culture milieus, and a stunning level of detail from the city of Agrabah.The cast is overall great in terms of voice acting (e.g. Jonathan Freeman's performance of Jafar), but the performance by Robin Williams stands out unparalleled as Genie. Williams' role absolutely dominates the experience as Genie, and his signature sense of impeccable humour is vividly sensed through his animated character. As a note, his Easter egg inclusion of Jack Nicholson hitting on a woman is pure improvisational magic.Overall, an excellent animation film from Disney, and deservedly the biggest film of 1992. Within the Disney Motion Picture range of films before Pixar, I think it is only bested by 1994's ""The Lion King"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Disney was on fire in the 90's! Here's another classic!,"Aladdin is the story of a poor thief (or Street Rat) he's struggling to make ends meet, but he dreams of the beautiful Princess Jasmine.
The villainous Jafar aims to force Jasmine into marriage so he can rule over Agrabah, however Aladdin discovers a Genie who can grant him wishes, together they aim to stop Jafar.Starting in '89 with The Little Mermaid Disney was making classic after classic.
Aladdin was definitely one of their best. It was definitely there funniest.
There are several comedic characters, such as Iago, Abu, Magic Carpet and the Sultan.
But none are anywhere near as funny as Genie.On top of being funny Aladdin also boasts a great soundtrack. Almost every song in this film is great!While I do feel like it was predictable, telling a story we're al very familiar with. It tells it in such a funny and bright way that's easily overlooked.Aladdin deserves it's spot on the Walt Disney Animated Studios canon!

Likably Silly Movie,"Aladdin is one of the good animated films of Disney today.  The animation is always good, the characters nice, and the story quite tolerable.

Like always, nobody does inspired animated movies better than Disney (yet nobody does bad, uninspired direct-to-video movies like Disney too).",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
"A Trove of Spirit, Melody and Color - Among Disney's Very Best","Even more than The Lion King, this is everything I picture when I think about Disney's early '90s renaissance. Following the lessons and experiences of The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin finds each of the studio's departments running at peak capacity. The artwork is picture-perfect, expertly exaggerated and densely detailed but also smooth and fluid in action. A catchy soundtrack suits the unique flavor of the Arabian culture, at once hearty, catchy and exotic without feeling manufactured or exploitative (neither of which were a given in Disney's previous efforts). And, highlighted - but not always dominated - by a typically high-energy performance from Robin Williams, the voice acting is unanimously excellent. It's an A+ production across the board, one with no weak points or hesitations.What struck me in this viewing was the abundance of rich, vibrant colors. Whether setting a scene or enhancing a particularly important plot development, the palette does its job with aplomb. As a sun-drenched desert film, one would expect a flush of shimmering yellows and oranges, and those tones do appropriately dominate its many daylight scenes. At night, though, a deeper, cooler range settles in, to equally potent result. A set of overnight developments outside the Cave of Wonders are especially magical, due in large part to these color choices. That spooky, panther-themed cavern would've been gorgeous even without such a powerful set of blue and purple tints - a marvelous display of imagination - but the dense, confident colors push it from just another cool movie visual into an unforgettable memory. Aladdin is well-stocked with such moments.The plot is quintessential Disney, for all that entails. Light and effectively humorous, with a strong foil, a lovable lead and (a studio specialty) all manner of loud, colorful supporting players. That Aladdin himself is so pure and simple was a necessity. If his character had been any more complicated, his personal arc more involved than ""get over yourself and tell the truth,"" he'd have been lost in the wash. With Williams's Genie running at roughly three punchlines per second, there's just no room for that kind of competition. As it stands, even poor Gilbert Gottfried is outshined by Williams's light. Probably the first and last time he's ever been the second-noisiest guy in a scene.There's a reason so many kids from my generation owned a copy of this one on VHS. It's a legitimate era-defining film, a feel-good family classic that also serves as a magnificent display of cinematic artisanship. As I now enter middle age and share the same adventure with my own kids, I'm pleased to report it still meets my lofty expectations.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Casting Robin Williams as the Genie was brilliant. In many of the other classics fro Disney I have grown a little out of the comic sidekicks, but not the Genie!Moving on to the other stuff. Jafar is also a great villain with just the right amount of slimy arrogance to his voice and also a devilish sidekick of Gilbert Gottfried!

Sailor Senshi Disney Princess Jasmine reporting in!,"Yes, I will admit it, I've watched this mainly because of the Disney Princess in it since I've lately been into a Disney Princesses kick, and I'm pretty satisfied of both her portrayal and the complete package.

Great animation, great music, great villian, great voice acting performances in particular by Robin Williams (whose awesome real voice I've never heard before steals the show) etc. Etc. Etc. The only downside of this, if you can call it that way, is that by watching it in its original form after something like twenty years after I watched it for the last time in my native language it's pretty clear that every single frame of this movie, like all the Disney movies I've watched lately, not only didn't need a remade but it was the de facto completely and totally impossible to remake in live-action form. Hence, I question how desperate the Disney higher-ups must be in terms of void of ideas vs. The need of cash if they greenlight something impossible to begin with, and the same applies to this movies' fanbase thirst for more.

A magical adventure with timeless charm,"Disney's 1992 animated film ""Aladdin"" is a magical adventure that captures the hearts of viewers with its vibrant animation, memorable characters, and enchanting music. Set in the fictional city of Agrabah, the story follows Aladdin, a ""diamond in the rough,"" who stumbles upon a magical lamp that houses a powerful Genie.Robin Williams' performance as the Genie is a standout, bringing boundless energy and humor to the film. His quick wit and countless impersonations make the Genie one of Disney's most beloved characters. The chemistry between Aladdin and Jasmine adds a romantic subplot that is both charming and engaging.The film's soundtrack, composed by Alan Menken with lyrics by Howard Ashman and Tim Rice, features iconic songs such as ""A Whole New World"" and ""Friend Like Me."" These musical numbers are beautifully animated and perfectly integrated into the storyline, enhancing the overall experience.While ""Aladdin"" follows the classic Disney formula, its rich storytelling, unforgettable characters, and stunning animation make it a standout.

Aladdin rubs its own lamp and summons one of Disney's best musicals.,"The beginning of the ""House of Mouse's"" renaissance era was probably the best few years since their conception. Aladdin contributes to that significantly, with its memorable songs and outstanding voice acting. A street rat is fooled into entering the Cave of Wonders and finds a mystical lamp that summons a genie, granting him three wishes. It's a simple yet effective story of the poor wanting to become wealthy, and soon transforming into something they are not.Presenting themes of envy and greed through Disney's signature animation style and huge amounts of character development. Almost immediately, each individual harness their own unique personality that make them stand out. Aladdin is this confident homeless man who remains envious of the rich. Jasmine despises the way of life she lives, not wanting to be forcefully married. Jafar, well, he's just the embodiment of evil. And the Genie is the perfect comic relief for what is an often engaging love story. The voice acting alone doesn't get enough credit, mostly because one particular actor steals all the credit. But let's address that, Robin Williams is the Genie. His comedic timing, energetic voice work and all round perfection ensures that he is the only choice for the role. What assists in his memorability are the plethora of songs that this musical boasts. Nearly every single one of them is catchy and instantly recognisable. From the romantic ""A Whole New World"" to the grandeur and flamboyancy of ""Prince Ali"", they all ingeniously progress the story through inventive lyrics. I'll be damned if you don't stand up and burst into ""Never Had A Friend Like Me"" whilst imitating the Genie's exotic dance moves. The hand-drawn animation remains stunning with the occasional CGI object, such as the cave's entrance, complementing this style.The story itself is well paced and quickly develops during its short ninety minute runtime, however the third act unfortunately runs out of wishes. The showdown with Jafar, the Genie's release from captivity and the inevitable happy ending were all too rushed and concluded the film in an unmemorable way. It was as if Clements and Musker ran out of ideas. Still, for the most part Aladdin exhumes a magical adventure filled with romance, personality and some of Disney's best songs.

Rating: A,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Aladdin is one of Disney's most adored classics, being the indisputable favorite of many, many fans. The Lion King will always have that spot in my heart, but I also visited this story set in Agrabah dozens of times. Now, with the 2019's remake about to premiere, I rewatched it last night and, once again, I fell in love. Honestly, I didn't remember how funny and entertaining it is! It still holds up incredibly well, even though the film was released almost 30 years ago. The animation still looks stunning and fluid, but it's the musical numbers and the voice work from the cast that makes this movie one of Disney's best.As it's known, Robin Williams shines in a role that stands out from his brilliant filmography, as his career-best interpretation of an animated character. Genie is one of the most versatile figures of Disney and Williams spreads out his wings of creativeness and imagination, delivering a phenomenal voice performance of the hilarious blue entity. From his seamless imitations to the simple yet extremely difficult tone changes, he gives everything. Genie appears every time the film most needs him, which is when the pacing starts to drop and needs something to pump it back up while moving the plot forward. He could merely be a plot device, but thankfully the writers gave him an unique personality with his own motivations, making us not only laugh with him but genuinely care about his destiny.That's the other main attribute of this movie: its writing. The dialogues feel realistic, grounded, and there are no real exposition scenes, besides the musical sequences, which are also meant to serve that purpose. Aladdin and Jasmine lived utterly opposite lives, and both wish to change. Each wants the other's life experiences and adventures, which provides some amazing moments between these characters. I still wish their relationship had more time to develop (something I hope the remake will do), as well as Jafar's motivations. It's 1992, and it's an animated film, but the cliche villain who wants power because ""I'm the bad guy"" never quite worked. However, the menacing and dark voice of John Freeman sells this character. In addition to these protagonists, Abu and Iago are two comedy sources that perfectly work, all the time.Musically, there is no way of denying the cultural impact that the Aladdin songs had. From Arabian Nights to A Whole New World, every song is filled with rich lyrics, great rhythm, and a beautiful tone. Not only are these able to develop the character or move the plot forward, but they also help the story never to break its fast pacing. Almost 30 years later, the animation quality still looks striking, and there are so many memorable backgrounds and visually outstanding settings. Disney's 90s decade is an absolute treasure in movie history: Beauty and the Beast, Toy Story, The Lion King, Pocahontas, Mulan, Tarzan, Aladdin and a few more animated diamonds (in the rough) that went a bit under the radar.All of these will definitely get a live-action remake (some already have), and I welcome all of them. Stop trying to boycott something that will only help the new generations to fall in love with the same characters that we did. Live-action isn't here to offend our childhood or produce cheap copies of our favorite films! It isn't here to replace the originals but to honor them instead by delivering modern takes on stories that impacted us on a deep emotional level, and that will try to do the same for our children, grandsons and nephews. Are they going to be better than the source material? Worse? It doesn't really matter as long as they keep the original's essence and the traits that made us adore these unforgettable characters. And, please, stop the ""they're doing these remakes for money"" argument. That can literally be said about every movie in the history of cinema. Unfortunately, entertainment is a business, it always was, and it always will be. Move on.All in all, Aladdin is a beautifully passionate story about how two incredibly different people with two completely different lifestyles can come to love each other by who they truly are. Robin Williams is a perfectly polished diamond and his scenes alone superbly elevate this film. One of Disney most impactful classics, filled with memorable songs, well-written characters, and stunning animation, which holds up remarkably still to this day. Despite some nitpicks regarding Jafar and the protagonists' relationship, Aladdin is undoubtedly an unbelievably precious gem which continues (and will continue) to be loved by newer generations all around the world.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

10/10,"Aladdin has alway been one of my favorite Disney movies as a child, and probably one of the most memorable ones. The Genie voiced by the one and only Robin Williams is a big highlight of this movie, he's funny, he's powerful, he can makes lots of transformations, and he's blue which is my favorite color. Aladdin himself is probably the character I rooted for because he makes mistakes and sometimes bad choices, but he always manage to fix them on his own. Jasmine is not only a beautiful princess, but she is also strong, independent, and has a bit of an attitude. The Sultan, not only a gullible, and caring father, but he's also very wise. Abu, and the Carpet are very unique characters too. Jafar is an awesome villain, he wants to rule Agrabah by his own rules. And his parrot Iago voiced by Gilbert Gottifred has a very distinct character. He's not just a loud mouthed parrot, but he's also sarcastic and a wise-cracker. The songs in this film are very enjoyable, especially One Jump Ahead, Friend Like Me, Prince Ali, and of course A Whole New World. The animation, awesome as always.

Not menacing enough on the outside. Yet still cunning in some ways. Can't say much about his parrot... Jasmine's dad was disappointingly boring (prefer the bubbly albeit blur cartoony-version). Jasmine herself was alright (neither great nor terrible). The ""feminist"" like scenes were like an unecessary extra and a bit annoying to watch (don't ask me why). Abu (monkey) was cute. He was captured nicely. And lastly Aladdin? For a break through actor, he actually did a good job portraying Aladdin.

This is similarly felt between Aladdin & Genie. Particularly towards the end. The lack of that ""core"" emotion is so disappointing that I couldn't enjoy the movie as a whole.

Funny and Entertaining Version by Guy Ritchie,"""Aladdin"" is a very funny and highly entertaining version of the Arabian Nights´ tale by Guy Ritchie.

Last but not the least, the monkey Abu and the evil macaw complete the brilliant cast of this good version indicated as a wonderful family entertainment.

"on a magic carpet ride, well","Greetings again from the darkness. Aladdin ... come on down! You are the next participant in Disney's ongoing mission for live-action remakes of their classic films. And rest easy fans, this time the mega-studio has done right by the original. Now that doesn't mean there aren't surprises. How about Guy Ritchie as director? How about a cast of mostly unknowns? How about modernized songs and even a new one sung by Jasmine? And it probably goes without asking, but how about a lot of CGI?Mena Massoud (""Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan"") stars as Aladdin, and he gets to showboat early in the film and flash some parkour skills in the familiar and high-octane chase through the village. Aladdin, of course, is labeled a 'street rat' and 'riff-raff', but he's also charming, handsome, talented as a thief, and quite warm-hearted. He and his pet monkey Abu - or more accurately, partner in crime - are streetwise and work quite well together, both for theft and love.Naomi Scott (slated to star in the CHARLIE'S ANGELS movie coming out later this year) is a beautiful and ambitious Princess Jasmine, who wants to succeed her father as Sultan of Agrabah, but is instead forced to choose between a steady stream of suitors - each a Prince, as required by law. Ms. Scott has a terrific singing voice and really gets to cut loose on the new woman power song ""Speechless"".The blue Genie is played by Will Smith, and this is what has fans of the beloved 1992 animated film so flustered. No, Will Smith is not Robin Williams, and few if any, could match the late great comedian for his energy and comedic flair. But Mr. Smith does a marvelous job of staying true to the original, while also adding his own style ... a style that works very well for comedy, music, and dramatic moments. He is not likely to disappoint anyone who has an open mind.So let's talk about the villain. Marwan Kenzari is Jafar, the man so dissatisfied with being number 2. Personally, I would have preferred a more intimidating bad guy, but given the tone of the film (more on that below), he's a solid fit. His sidekick and smart-aleck parrot Iago is voiced by Alan Tudyk (it was the distinctive Gilbert Gottfried in the 1992 version). Two other key supporting roles include Nasim Padrad (""Saturday Night Live"") as Dalla, Jasmine's handmaiden; and Navid Negahban (Abu Nazir in ""Homeland"") as the Sultan and Jasmine's father.It's been 27 years since Robin Williams' Genie entertained so many, and the comparisons to that version are inevitable. It's a relief that Disney opted to keep the film family friendly (Rated PG) and avoid the dark tone that had their recent projects aimed more at adults than kids, rather than the balance they've been known for more than 6 decades. Yes, this is the same director that made SNATCH (2000) and SHERLOCK HOLMES (2009), neither of which any decent parent would allow their young kids to watch. But, Mr. Ritchie has delivered a film which entertained (and didn't overly frighten) kids as young as 5 in the screening I attended.Director Ritchie co-wrote the script with John August, who is best known for his work with Tim Burton (BIG FISH, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, CORPSE BRIDE, DARK SHADOWS, FRANKENWEENIE). The film runs 2 hours and 8 minutes, 38 longer than the 1992 film ... though it doesn't feel too long. Gemma Jackson's set design of Agrabah, the Palace, and the Cave of Wonders are all stunning, and then of course, there is the music. Alan Menken won an Oscar for ALADDIN (1992) and his music is back and modernized, and sounds wonderful ... especially ""A Whole New World"" and Jasmine's new song.
With a talented cast of Arab/Middle Eastern/Central Asian/Southern Asian actors, there should be no cries of ""foul"", and there really is something special about a movie that can be thoroughly enjoyed by all ages. The Bollywood-type closing number provides a kaleidoscope of color, texture and dancing ... and is a nice twist to ""You've Never Had a Friend Like Me"". And I'll leave you with this final offer: you can have the monkey, if I can have the magic carpet.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
I don't understand why the critics are bashing on this one.,"I honestly didn't know what I was going into and it was such a delightful surprise! It really exceeded my expectations and I had fun during the whole movie. Critics are really being harsh and I can't believe that beauty and the beast was more critically praised. The movie was so bland and boring while this one has so much energy and life to it. The characters had amazing chemistry with each other and the lines were delivered smoothly. The two things I was worried about that subsided as soon as the movie started are:
1- Jafar's character: Marwan tries his best to make but the material he's given isn't strong enough. I wish they developed his character more. However, I didn't mind the change they did it with his character as it fits more with this version.
2- Cultural representation: The trailers made the movie look like a production from bollywood. Not hating on the Indian culture, but it really annoyed me as Arab to see a Middle Eastern/Arabic folk tale that we all know long before Disney introduced it to the world to be represented in a fully different culture. Fortunately, the movie looks and feels way more Arabian such Arabic writings here and there, hearing some people speaking Arabic briefly, the names and appearance of the people of Agrabah and of course the amazing score! Although there are some slight hints of India/South Asia in the clothing and dancing, but I didn't mind that at all.I would've give it a 10 if the cinematography was better. This is my only issue with movie as it looked like high budget TV soap opera in some scenes.Don't miss on this one! You'll have fun.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Aladdin lacks real magic,"Even with a colossal budget and the spectacular tech available to Disney, live actors can't replicate the dizzy kinetics of a cartoon.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Not as Agrabahd as I was expecting.,"You all know the plot! ""Street-rat"" Aladdin (Mena Massoud) fancies Princess Jasmine of Agrabah (Naomi Scott). Her father, the sultan (Navid Negahban), only wants happiness for her. But the law says that she can only marry a prince.Meanwhile, the sultan's evil adviser Jafar (Marwan Kenzari) perceives Aladdin as the fabled ""diamond in the rough"": the only one able to enter the 'cave of wonders' to retrieve an old lamp; a lamp that contains a genie who will grant the owner three wishes.The biggest problem here is a 27-year old legacy from the late Robin Williams. In 1992 he embarked on 90 minutes of improvised riffing that the clever Disney animators worked around. How exactly does anyone follow that? Who exactly *could* follow that? As it is, Will Smith has a good crack as the genie, but only makes it to about 60% on the Robin-o-meter. He seems to be far less ""street"" in this film than his normal persona, perhaps being asked to tone it down by Disney? But this feels like a bad call. If he'd been allowed to 'let-rip' and ad lib, Williams-style, the film might have been a bit more dynamic.Elsewhere in the acting stakes, both Mena Massoud and Marwen Kenzari both feel underpowered: Massoud can sing adequately for the lead, but lacks the screen presence to nail the role; Dutch actor and comedian Kenzari on the other hand is supposed to be utterly evil but comes across as mildly sarcastic with a side order of constipation. There are a whole world of actors out there who could go the whole ""Billy Zane"" on the role... but apparently overlooked.
In both cases - and in general for the whole production - the roles seem to have been largely chosen for their facial similarities to the animated characters rather than for their charisma or acting abilities.The biggest change in the script, other than minor tweaks for current taste and sensibilities - ""barbaric"" for example is gone! - is the respect given to Jasmine who gets a thoroughly ""MeToo"" makeover as the empowered force for good behind the throne. She even gets her own song - ""Speechless"" - which gets a curious ""snippet"" treatment initially but which comes good in fine style later on.And Naomi Scott is a revelation in the part, setting the screen on fire as a sexy, sassy and wise Disney heroine. Scott firmly sets herself up here as ""one to watch"" in the future. She is far and away the best thing in the film.Also good as Jasmine's maid is Saturday Night Live regular Nasim Pedrad, who I spent most of the film thinking was Selma Hayak!With four grandkids under 5, I always view these films with an eye to ""suitability"". In Aladdin, there are a few dodgy moments early on: 'henchman number 5' gets suddenly munched by the ""blue tiger cave""; and Jafar - clearly to illustrate the depths to which either his 'sarcasm' or his 'constipation' can reach - tosses his hapless right-hand-man down a well to his (presumed) death. (""It's OK little one.... there was a BIIIIGGGG pillow at the bottom""). But other than that, and some possibly scary 'giant-Jafar' effects in the finale, the rest of the film is pretty innocuous. My one reservation for younger kids would be the 128 minute running time. It's a bit flabby in places, and cutting 10 minutes out of the run-time would help youngsters with a less-than feature length attention span.Guy Ritchie has the unenviable job of bringing it all in, and I was not disappointed by the effort. There is a visual flair on show that made it very watchable. There are also some nice Disney in-jokes: the carpet builds the Disney castle opening titles (tinker bell arc and all!) and the genie conjures up ""Fantasyland"" on the map.Overall, I went into this expecting to hate it, but I didn't. The songs lack the manic pizzazz of the original animated versions, but some of them still worked well: ""Friend like Me"" is particularly effective (I actually got to hear and understand the lyrics this time!). It's a perfectly fun way to spend a couple of hours at the cinema, and for kids, particularly those without the reference of the Disney original, will probably love it.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the interweb or Facebook.

"Sadly, it met my expectations","What's to say. Before even filming we knew Guy Ritchie was obviously the wrong choice to direct the film. His style doesn't quite lend itself to this type of film.
Miscast Mena Massoud didn't bring any real character to the role of Aladdin he was simply okay/ functional.
Will Smith is as usual charismatic and had difficult shoes to fill after Robin Williams' take on the genie but he was seriously let down by the VFX in blue genie mode and a weak script.
Another miscast Naomi Scott gave a good performance but I always felt i was looking at Indian and not Middle Eastern. In fact the film IS very bollywood with the Jasmin, Aladdin dance off Indian Style (and to Indian music) then Russian dancing(?) plus other times an Indian soundtrack.
And i'm not even going to talk about that sorry excuse for a villain. No, no i am not.
For a Disney movie set in large Kingdom it sure does feel quite quite small. It looked cheap too. Weird.
Ultimately a dreadfully executed cash grab of a movie that no one asked for. Thanks D.

Disney sadly misses the mark... again.,"Like many of the Disney live action adaptations, this film utterly fails to understand what made the original so great to begin with. Moments of character growth or interaction feel rushed and are changed up from the original, yet the outcome in the story still illogically remains the same. Some of the additional scenes around new characters simply feel laughable and out of place.
The additional song written for this film heavily clashes with the musical style of the existing ones and the instrumental accompaniment of the songs in general sounds too modern and not like a classical musical anymore.
The humor in this movie is very hit and miss. Some lines and moments are indeed extremely enjoyable, while most others seem too forced.
The VFX in this film are not entirely up to task and will undoubtedly look dated in a few years time. Most importantly, the overall spectacle feels much less impactful than the original's.

Where is the wonder in the cave of wonders? Where is the feeling of flying a magic carpet? Where is the Aladdin we all can relate to and inspires us to be better? Where is the family relationship we can all relate to?

He rubs the lamp and is shocked by the magic Genie (Will Smith) who gives him three wishes.Disney has settled on this lucrative formula of remaking old animated classics into live-action films. It's safe. Families can take their kids. The IP is well-established. They have plenty of material in the Disney vault. It all makes sense as long as Will Smith is purple. The casting fits. The setting is CGI but reasonably real enough. There are no complaints about the production. A purple Will Smith comes with some issues but somehow he fits the role. I do have an issue with People sees what they want to see. It's a fine idea and there is a movie logic to it. What is missing is emotional logic. It's missing the narrative logic. The audience wants them to be in fantasy love. She has to recognize him right away. The movie does save it by her recognizing him quickly and him spinning the lie. The story needs to help her out a bit. Maybe, she doesn't recognize him right away because her encounter with him is during the dark of night and she didn't get a good look at him. In addition, he could be made into a Robin Hood character and he's hiding among the shadows deliberately. It's maybe asking too much to change the story but it shouldn't be set in stone.

Better than my expectations,"It was a decent adaptation. Surely not flawless and it did miss some of the magic of the original Disney cartoon however it was a worthy remake with many fine elements and actually it had some of the old magic.
The most surprising fact was the performance of Will Smith who actually nailed it most of the times and really captured some of the charmes Robin Williams gave the original. He was funny and well nuanced. A positive surprise and a really good performance by Smith. I wasnt too fond of Mena Massoud who looked the role but needed some more acting lessons. Naomi Scott was generally good and a perfect choice for the role of Jasmine (yes I know there are discussion regarding her origins but she looked the role and the performance was fine). Not a fan at all of the casting of Marwan Kenzari who first of all was too young and second really overacted the role in a bothering way.
What I liked was that the film reimagined some of the iconic scenes but also added some new moments or rather changed and modernized moments of the original so it wasnt just a 1:1 remake. The production design and costumes were great. Guy Ritchie generally did a solid job. also the Visuals worked.

The actor that plays Jafar is next. AWFUL, not menacing enough and it makes for a very lack-lustre performance. Naomi Scott on the other hand was absolutely brilliant as Jasmine.

Pointless and lost.,"Disney strikes back with yet another live-action remake disaster that soils the name of the original movies. Aladdin (2019) is a confused mess. It not only adds nothing remarkable on to the original to justify it's existence, but Aladdin is a movie that only works in animation, because in live-action it's identity is just lost. The CGI is abominable. Despite a few scenes where it's OK, the CGI overall is shockingly bad for a Disney film and it's even more depressing that they sunk so much money into it. The Genie specifically is one of the worst looking CGI characters I've seen in some time. And more on the Genie; I've seen a lot of people say that they like Will Smith's Genie, and while I will commend Smith for not trying to imitate Robin Williams' Genie and for doing his on thing, it's just not working for me. They also butchered a lot of the songs, specifically ""Friend Like Me"" and ""Prince Ali"". Not only can Will Smith not sing to save his life and the songs have been 69'd by autotune, but they've also added some new lines and lyrics into them as well as changing their flow and energy at times. While it's fine to add some differences from the original, this is the wrong kind of different. No one wanted the songs to be changed and the new lyrics are OK at best and shockingly bad at worst. The flow and tone of the songs has also been changed and that's probably due to Will Smith's singing, because what made Robin Williams' Genie great is the sheer amount of incredible energy he gave which is also what made ""Friend Like Me"" and ""Prince Ali"" so fun and catchy. Here, Will Smith completely butchers these songs, especially ""Prince Ali"" because of how slow and boring it is compared to the original. Finally, the movie is just pointless. It doesn't justify it's existence at all. Why would I want to watch a boring and slow version of the original with none of the colourful, expressive animation and humour when I can watch the original, at ANY TIME, which has the expressive animation and humour?

Not quite a whole new world but it's pretty close 😉,"Alright, I was 11 when Aladdin came out in '92 and I instantly fell in love with the film and soundtrack 😍👏Now fast forward to tonight and I've now seen the live adaptation at 38. I won't lie, I was super skeptical about the film for so many reasons but the main reason was that Robin Williams could never be replaced as the Genie.I was ready to leave the theater within the first 20 minutes due to the pacing of the film but I knew I couldn't do that without seeing what the always charismatic Will Smith could possibly do to fill these impossible blue shoes 🤔I am SO glad that I stayed because as soon as the Friend Like Me song started the movie flipped the nostalgic kid switch in me 😃 It was such an amazing sequence and I knew instantly that Will Smith was the perfect casting for this role. I'm certain that Robin Williams would approve of his respectful take 💙If you have reservations about this film, let them go. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised with what entire cast and crew were able to create. It may not be a whole new world but it's pretty close 😉👍",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Why fix it if it's not broken?,"Let me start by saying that the visuals of the movie were pretty stunning. The camera work was pretty great even chasing after Aladdin's parkour type running around. HOWEVER. There are times where you can tell that the video has been sped up. It's so obvious that it really takes away from the scene and just makes it an awful experience.The music. I get that all Will Smith knows how to do is hip-hop. But this is a Disney movie and that is not needed here. The original songs are fantastic without needing any kind of revamping. If they really wanted to revamp any of the music then they could've taken a page out of the Broadway adaptation. Why did ""One Jump"" need the hip-hop in it? Will Smith wasn't even in that scene. It's just unnecessary and ruins the moment.The autotune is so obvious that anytime someone is ""singing"" it sounds so flat and boring. The only person that could actually carry a tune is Jasmine. Aladdin's voice is so autotuned that it sounds like he's bored with what he's saying. There's no emotion in his voice. And Will Smith is just talk-singing the whole time. I will say that ""Prince Ali"" was excellent though.Jasmine's new solo song is a great song, but the reprise is just unnecessary. It completely stops the flow of the film and does not belong.All in all I would watch this film again, but it definitely did not live up to my expectations.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Thoroughly Enjoyable,"I'm not sure why there is all of this negativity about this movie, I really enjoyed it. The negative reviews from the critics had actually put me off watching it until today when I decided to go to it in the cinema. Lucky me I was the only one in the screen.
To be honest I wasn't a real fan of the original animation, I am a huge Disney fan with my favourite being Robin Hood.
I thought Will Smith did a good job as the Genie without trying to out do the wonderful Robin Williams. The roles in the movie were perfectly cast and I just found myself sitting back, watching and enjoying the movie.
My advice is watch it yourself and make up your own mind.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Built-In Audience,"Much like a Tyler Perry movie, or Transformers instalment, Disney's new throng of live-action remakes was destined to have a built-in audience. The fate of the legacy was decided on the success of the first attempt, 2016's The Jungle Book. Jon Favreau created a familiar, but thankfully not a cut and paste remake that showed the potential of truly fantastic CGI. A single human interacted with a remarkably life-like world and any reticence I had about the necessity of its existence fell away. More than being a well-crafted exercise in technology, it was a plain good movie. The following year, Beauty and the Beast stepped up to the bar and it was decided then that quality would likely take a backseat to familiarity for future developments. A taken-for-granted audience was guaranteed, and with a library spanning 80 years, Disney films could now be repackaged and digitized to autopilot a franchise. For all its occasional charm, Guy Ritchie's Aladdin 2019 is continuing a tradition based more on the Disney brand than the Disney magic.Much like Beauty and the Beast, I can only briefly describe how marginally Aladdin departs from the animated feature. If the nagging thought ""I've already seen this movie"" doesn't bother you, you're getting exactly what you came to see. The street-rat one jump ahead of the lawmen, the princess in disguise, the Cave of Wonder, it's all there, confined to a box that won't spoil a single pre-conceived notion.Nobody can deny that Mena Massound embodies Aladdin like he fell seamlessly into a mold. Naomi Scott plays Princess Jasmine as if a casting agent was given the directions, ""Go find me a 25 year-year-old Sarah Michelle Gellar of Middle-Eastern decent,"" and find her they did. I don't know how much of themselves our two leads were allowed to bring to these roles, but I didn't feel much. When I first saw Will Smith in a pre-view, glowing blue and built like The Rock, I had to remind myself that there was no point in comparing anyone to Robin Williams. As Aladdin came to the second act, I was actually a little anxious to get to something that felt new. I can assure you Smith does not disappoint. Even while watching ""Friend Like Me,"" I wasn't hearing Robin Williams re-packaged, I was seeing a gamble pay off. Will Smith has his own musical style and incorporates that contagious personality into a new genie that could have gone horribly wrong.Almost as severe as the initial pullback fans had of Will Smith as the Genie, was Marwan Kenzari as Jafar. The animated character's sharp features and measured delivery doesn't lend itself to a specific actor I can think of off-hand, but Marwan certainly isn't it. As much as I would welcome a fresh anything to the feature, forgettable is forgettable.What we can mark as a successful new addition to the Aladdin soundtrack is Jasmine's powerful Speechless. I would not have checked Aladdin as needing a strong feminine anthem, but this one was built to impress. The story arc makes a more progressive turn than any preceding genesis of the story and sheer effectiveness beat out an eye-roll. The same cannot be said for the film as a whole. Favreau made such a strong statement with The Jungle Book that I can't imagine July's The Lion King will be anything less than incredible, but Aladdin seems to be a precursor to an upcoming decade of safe remakes that will transparently play a numbers game. I can only hope the magic comes back to Disney.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Pretty fun re-imagining with a very empowering Princess and well fleshed our characters overall,"Naomi Scott's performance and take on Princess Jasmine is amazing, if you have young kids whether they be male or female I would highly recommend you show them this film as I found her to be much more empowering and fleshed out than the majority of the female characters (or just characters for that matter) that I saw on screen growing up (which wasn't long ago I was born in 2001) and feel she'd make a great role model for impressionable kids. In fact while I still personally prefer he original I think all the characters in this where much more fleshed out, the music was still great (the lyrics of Arabian Nights are much more positive about Middle Eastern culture although none of the songs beat the originals) including Jasmines new songs, the new Character Daria worked great and ultimately I quite enjoyed it.As for the overall movie, I'd recommend going into this film as if it's a pantomime that clearly drew from Disney's film and won't get everything right but is still fun to watch on its own merit. They knew they couldn't top the original if they just copied it, so they tried doing a reimagining that would play to its own strengths and I find it worked in its favour.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
This old man's thoughts,"Mrs. Shullivan and I are familiar with the earlier live and animated versions of Aladdin, but this version brings new life into the FAMILY ADVENTURE film which can be enjoyed in its purest form with all its spectacular color and escapism from your otherwise ho hum day.Will Smith is a wonderful, magical and wise genie. The lead role of Aladdin is played to perfection by the relative newcomer Mena Massoud. Aladdin's love interest and excited passenger on his magic carpet is Princess Jasmine played by the multi-talented Naomi Scott. Their singing duets were also enjoyable.This is definitely a family themed big adventure film, but it is also a classic DISNEY film that will definitely stand the test of time and when it is eventually released in the public domain, on whatever the current film format of the time may be, VHS, DVD, Blu Ray, 4K and/or 8K, I guarantee it will be enjoyed across the world in hundreds of different languages by young and old alike!I hope you can ignore all the bad reviews (I assume it's Disney's competition and/or disgruntled former Disney employees) and I bet a dime to a dollar the same people wrote bad reviews on earlier Disney released too!

It's not a masterpiece, but it's a solid family pastime, which quite faithfully follows the animated original (even actors unexpectedly resemble animated characters), with an interesting story, pleasant music, and witty moments. Will Smith is good as expected, and the others are not far behind, except for Jafar and Sultan, who were, in my opinion, totally lame.

"It was all right, but nothing you haven't seen before","I am not sure what is up with the trend of Disney redoing their old animated classics and turning them live action. Well, okay, there is the whole money thing; however, that does not really explain why people want to see almost the exact same film again or why Disney is releasing so many of these live action adaptations in 2019 as there have been two so far and at least one more to go. I would probably spread them out a bit, hold one back for hard times or something. This one is the live action Aladdin, and it was okay, but nothing that will blow you away in terms of new content.The story is essentially the same as Aladdin dreams of wooing Jasmine the princess. He is given the opportunity to enter a cave and retrieve something for Jafar and it turns out to be a lamp containing a magical genie. Well, Aladdin now has three wishes and Jafar has schemes of his own as Aladdin wishes to win the princess and Jafar wishes to rule the kingdom!The casting was pretty good as I thought Will Smith as the genie was the highlight of the film and he held it together making it more enjoyable. The guy who played Aladdin was rather good and Jasmine was most definitely a much better looking counterpart to the Disney princess she was playing in comparison to Emma Watson's Bell. Was not wild about the guy playing Jafar though as he did not really seem all that evil and also did not really look the part to me.So, this live action adaptation was better to me than the Beauty and the Beast one, it seemed more like a movie. That one seemed like some sort of special one would see on ABC to me for some reason. It was a bit tedious at first, but once Will Smith entered the picture as the genie I thought the film livened up a lot and was more enjoyable. There are a few new things added to this as the genie has a love interest, but for the most part, it is essentially the same film with not too much in there to surprise. Next up, the live action Lion King which my wife will probably also want to go to.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Not as good as the cartoon.,"To start off, I wanted to like this movie alot because the cartoon version was amazing growing up.
This movie had very beautiful costumes, beautiful scenery, the graphics weren't that bad. But their was cringe in the acting.
I found it strange how some actors had accents and other did not. Like the two MAIN characters. Also. Their were these strange dance scenes that would be Arabian dancing then hip hop mixed it? And contemporary I guess? It was all for fun I know. But its Agraba based in Arabia and Arabian traditions I thought. Which brings me to my next point. The cringy women empowerment thing they were pushing with jasmine was very cringy worth. And I'm all for women empowerment, as a women. She had these random song moments. Which to some maybe empowering but it just came off as random and culturly incorrect. But whatever it's a movie with a flying carpet and a genie.
Will Smith was funny as always though. His genie graphics were. little weird for some reason on his face. I probably won't see it again. But I WILL be watching the cartoon tonight to cleanse the brain.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Weak acting resulting in boring movie; CGI for even common animals,"The acting and chemistry between characters is so weak that it seems as if the directors pulled amateurs off the street, threw elaborate costumes on them, shot them separately in front of a green screen during their first reading, and then composited them all together with CGI. Speaking of fakery, even common animals like the monkey and tiger are CGI, when Hollywood has been using real, trained such animals with success in the industry for years. What's the point of a ""live action"" movie if even such common elements are unreal CGI.

Will Smith's Genie is legendary,"As many movie-goers know, live adaptations of animated films rarely fair well. Thankfully, Aladdin is an exception. One of the biggest question marks coming in was how Will Smith could possibly fill the shoes of Robin Williams. I think it is safe to say that they have been filled and expanded, because Smith's genie was phenomenal. The entire ""You Ain't Never Had a Friend Like Me"" scene had me glued to the screen in awe and wonder. I have to imagine a quarter of the budget was dropped in that 2 minute window. The only thing better than the effects was the costume design, which I believe is deserving of any number of nominations. The one gripe I had with the film, albeit a minor one, is that it could have stood to cut 10 minutes out by eliminating the ""Speechless"" songs. It ultimately added nothing to the story and the second song felt like I was watching some weird fan flick. Don't count this film out!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

A Disney classic comes to life!,"What can I say? When you hear that one of your favourite Disney classics is going to be recreated for live action, you also hear that tiny voice of trepidation in your head saying ""please don't mess this up"". Well I'm pleased to say that was not the case here. Aladdin is a complete triumph.
Let's break this down.Will Smith as the Genie was always going to be a huge talking point. He had some very large Robin Williams style shoes to fill. Smith admittedly did not want to recreate perfection but instead put his own spin on the character whilst still maintaining the nostalgia of the role. It's fair to say it was a success. There were some classic Smith comedy moments throughout as well as stamping his own original musical flare into some of the films most famous numbers. A great job for the Hollywood legend.As for Mena Massoud (a fairly unknown actor) who played the title character, he was simply perfect for the role. He looked the part, had an excellent singing voice and managed to capture the cheeky charisma of the character brilliantly well. With some excellent dance scenes and some hilarious comedy timing with co star Smith, Massoud was a truly wonderful casting choice for the film. He really is the real life Aladdin.It wasn't just Massoud and Smith who stood out either. Naomi Scott (Princess Jasmine) and Marwan Kenzari (Jafar) gave an equally believable performance in recreating these characters. Naomi's out of this world singing voice was enough to send shivers down your spine whilst the villainous stare and evil tongue of Kenzari did not disappoint. A film is only as strong as its actors and everyone in Aladdin did a phenomenal job.The film itself was very well directed. A huge standing O to Guy Ritchie for putting his own personal film style on this without diviating from the well known story line and maintaining the magic of the classic 1992 original.
Visually spectacular scenes including the memorable flying carpet scene and the cave of wonders greatly exceeded my expectations. This CGI magic mixed with some excellent musical production scenes made this film one I would watch again and again. A classic story exquisitely made with an immensely talented cast. What more could you want from Disney? For me, watching this was like watching one of my favourite childhood films come to life.

Aladdin (2019),"We are deep in the new age of Disney. One where beloved animated features are remade in a live action format, for better or for worse. When Aladdin was announced, I was game. The animated version is one of my favorite Disney films and I liked the look of the actor they got to play Aladdin. Will Smith's genie definitely looked weird and creepy when they first showed him but I was still going to give this a fair shot. Having seen it, it was better than I expected it to be. As a matter of fact, it was thoroughly enjoyable.The film is a bout a poor street thief names Aladdin, who one day encounters the princess of the city of Agrabah. He stumbles across a magic lamp and a eccentric magical genie who grants him three wishes. Aladdin wants to enlist the help of the genie to win the heart of the princess. However, an evil sorcerer who advises for the Sultan of Agrabah wants to get hold of the genie to enable his evil plans of becoming the Sultan himself. The film stars Mena Massoud, Naomi Scott, Will Smith, and Marwan Kenzari.I thought overall the casting was solid. Massoud is great as Aladdin in this, and emulates the animated version. Scott is a beautiful and worthy Jasmine, Smith is a highlight in the film due to his bombastic and entertaining performance. The only downside was Kenzari as Jafar. Was so unbelievably hammy and a terrible fit in the role, for me anyways. Apart from that its nice to see a live action update on a beloved tale. For the most part the effects, costume design, and the fantastical world created looked wonderful. At times the CG on Abu and Rajah looked ropy.This is a long film. Its a full 40 minutes longer than the animated classic. It adds new elements to the film but overall feels like a modern and fairly faithful update to the animated film. Much like Beauty and The Beast. I can see people not being blow away by this but for what it was and how bad it could have been, I was pretty impressed. Not sure how I feel about the live action Disney films in the long run but Aladdin is one of the better ones for sure.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

"Definetly not a disaster that I worried it might be, but it's also not a whole new world","Like Beauty and the Beast, this movie exists for novelty of seeing a Disney classic live action. But I think that this one distinguishes itsfelf a lot more for the simple fact that Will Smith is such a different genie from Robin Williams, but he's also a great genie. When they first announced this project I was just as skeptical as everyone else because I was like ""Who can replace Robin Williams?"" but then they announced Will Smith and I thought yes........ that's the best person for this role because he has all the energy and charisma of Robin Williams, but in a totally different way and that's what elevates this movie and makes it interesting. Some of the tweaks here and there I think we're actually improvements, especially involving the framing device for this new story.

In my perspective, Disney live-actions that try to make a remake equal to the original (like Beauty and the Beast or The Lion King) always lose a lot of emotion when turning the animation into live-action and Aladdin managed to keep what the classic had good.
The visual effects are good and the costumes are amazing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Rating 10/10 Aladdin truly is magical. Aladdin has a long and illustrious legacy. As usual, the plot of beggar Aladdin and Princess Jasmine fighting for their love is incredible. This movie was great !! It has comedy,action,romance,adventure and everything else including in all genres of all movie. The acting from everyone was great.

It made me smile,"It made me smile. That might not sound very significant but I mean that I was smiling nearly all the way through. Once the film gets going, it is fun, enjoyable, charismatic and has a style close to the original but with just enough differences to stand out. My biggest criticisms are the ending went on longer than was necessary and some of the musical numbers didn't quite have the same oomph as in the original. But they still made me smile and I still got a kick out of them. I won't be buying any home release versions but I'm glad I saw it on the big screen and if I'm channel surfing one day in a few years and stumble across it then I will happily watch it again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
COMPLETE MESS,"From start to finish this is a complete mess and strays so far from the original. I don't mind enhancing the story and putting a new spin on it, but Guy Richie butchered it by changing it in every possible way.The dialogue is painful and unnatural and the musical scenes are a mess.Aside from Naomi Scott, the casting was terrible. The old wise character of Jafar was totally destroyed by Marwan Kenzari. One of the best characters in the original, Jafar's sidekick Iago, could barely talk and for some reason was turned into a monster in one of the many completely unnecessary scenes.Basically unrecognisable from one of Disney's great original movies and a real shame. No idea why Disney allowed this mess to happen.",1.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

"""I'm Too Much!"" - The Genie.","Aladdin (2019) -This unnecessary and frankly insulting remake was like a really poor Bollywood film and it had none of the charm or sheer exuberance of the original (1992) and best. If it ain't broke, don't try and even attempt to do anything to it in this case.Mena Massoud in the title role of Aladdin had less charisma than the badly done CGI Tiger and Jafar (Marwan Kenzari) had none of the menacing presence of the original. He was just obviously nasty, with no mystery.I hadn't even been looking at it to draw a comparison and I was determined to watch it with the view that it was something new entirely, but actually none of the additions or changes made any improvements
They had tried too hard to make it like a theatrical production, perhaps taking inspiration from the stage show, and they appeared to be trying to modernise it and hip hopify it.From the beginning I was questioning how long I could put up with it, but ultimately I decided to watch it until Will Smith arrived as The Genie, to see if it improved, but if anything he made it worse. They had made him either super gay or like a teenage girl and he just seemed totally inappropriate in the part. His CGI wasn't that good either.In fairness to the man he did have some big shoes to fill, Robin Williams had embodied the role and made it his own for eternity, but the Genie's introductory number, 'Friend like me' was ruined due to over processing and a lack of something from Will.In general I found most of the CGI to be pretty poor and that was really obvious against a truly fake set.I didn't even get as far as the 'Prince Ali' song though. The words I had jotted on my notes were - Obnoxious, tacky, vulgar, loud and garish!I won't be entertaining any ideas to watch it again and I will stick to the 1992 version, because that one wasn't broken!Unscored as Unfinished.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

It was okay,"First, I liked the casting for all except for the geni. The animation for the geni wasn't the best. Will had the attitude but the poor cgi let it down.
Second, the costumes for the most part looked too much like cheap Halloween costumes, I expected them to make them look more Arab and extravagant.
Third, the cgi team did a fantastic job with the scenes and the landscapes. It was on point.
Fourth, they could have updated and fleshed out the script a bit better. It was a little choppy at some points.
Finally, the musical numbers were amazing! Especially ""speechless""

Guy Ritchie's best film to date,"Well that was a visual masterpiece - just seen it and it's well worth seeing - now I've got to be honest I know the story , well you know the story but you've probably seen the 1992 version with Robin Williams - I actually haven't but the song 'Whole new world' seemed very familiar !A huge budget of $180m has grossed over $600 - something tells me Disney made a wise decision to employ Guy Ritchie . Second boy of honesty I've never really enjoyed his films I'm not a fan of the cgi induced Sherlock Holmes franchise - but I can see Disney making an Aladdin 2 from this .The story is a classic though not as old as you think although derived from the Arabian Nights it was a relatively modern day take on the classic tale by a french man which has been the story adapted over and over again that we all love .It's a musical - that won't surprise many as it's a reinterpretation of the 1992 animated version in live action , brilliantly cast - Will Smith and Naomi Scott steal the showIt's a family feel good movie well worth the watch .

Was bad for reasons I wasn't' expecting and good for reasons I also wasn't expecting.,"As with many people the trailer made me feel weird about Will Smith as genie. I thought he would be the worst part of the movie. But I was wrong. He was the best part. He did Robin Williams justice. Obviously the genie had a few tweaks to fit Wills but it worked VERY well. Even the music with its very slight ""modern"" touch was amazing.So why only a 6?
To start Apu wasn't used much in the movie and wasn't ""humorous"" like in the original with his actions. And Lago flat out was terrible. He just has a basic boring ""Polly wants a cracker!"" voice. No comedy or anything to him. He also was barley in the movie. The magic carpet was also not used alot and had no real character either. Rajah to was bland (the tiger).Jafar was less scary looking and his voice didn't feel as ""villainous"". The actor who played Aladdin did a pretty good job but something still felt off. That said the actress who played Jasmine was excellent. Though the new song they added about ""women"" kind of was annoying. I get the point of the song but felt thrown in to appease certain groups of people.Am I saying this movie was horrible? Its not the worst of the remakes by far. It was really good. But I don't see myself watching it again. If I did it would only be because of Will as the Genie. I'd rate it way above Dumbo and above Beauty and the Beast.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

A really good remake!,"What a joy! This movie answered questions that the original did not answer! The acting was phenomenal, the sets were beautiful, the songs were perfect! I loved it!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
"Fine, but no Match for the Original","Aladdin is the latest in a long line of Disney live action ""reimaginings,"" which have been a source of massive box office success, with 4 of them grossing over $1 billion. Since Aladdin was one of the most popular movies of the 90's, it was inevitable that it would be remade. While people still keep seeing them, their reception from critics has been less than positive, for the most part. Aladdin had buzz from the get go after a truly awful trailer. But all publicity is good publicity, and the movie made bank.Even though this movie isn't bad, per se, it's hard to not compare it to the original, which just shows how much better the original is. Take the Prince Ali song sequence, for instance. In the 1992 movie, it's a grand scale number with a sense of hugeness and importance. In this version, it sounds fine, but just feels like a Will Smith music video, not a grand number in a musical. The problem is that it doesn't feel as magical as the animated original. The reason for that is likely because animation as a medium allows for a greater suspension of disbelief, and therefore more immersion in the magic. In that regard, the overly CGI Cave of Wonders, for instance, seems less real than the animated version. The same can be said for the Sultan's palace. The sense of grandeur from either of these places is muted in the remake, where they're massive and imposing in the original.Aladdin actually did change some stuff significantly from the 1992 movie. It added a completely new song, Speechless, sung by Jasmine near the end. It's a pretty good song, and it's performed well. Some weird stuff happens on screen. Jafar's motives are changed almost completely. Instead of marrying Jasmine, he's now a political mastermind, trying to unite all the different kingdoms into his own empire.Another thing that needs to be said is Will Smith. He caught a lot of flak for taking on the role of the Genie, but he isn't bad in the role. The reason for this is because he doesn't spend the whole movie pretending to be Robin Williams. He isn't and he can't be. While they both are the same character, they are distinctly Robin Williams and Will Smith, respectively. This is good, as it lets Smith be himself and present the character in a way only he could. Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott are Aladdin and Jasmine. They do give good performances, especially Scott, but it's hard to see them as Aladdin and Jasmine, because they aren't the 1992 characters.By the way, this movie does somewhat confirm a long-held fan theory, that the guy at the beginning of the movie is actually the Genie. That's a theory in the original but is self-evident here.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

"For a Disney live-action remake, it was good.","Disney has been making these classic remakes dark and Aladdin was a fresh new take, going to a more fun route. Mena Massoud is the physical embodiment of Aladdin that's for sure (the looks, the voice, the charm). I want to praise the guy for showing an absolute Aladdin persona, although there were many scenes where Jasmine or the Genie upstaged him too much. The OG Genie had a larger-than-life charisma too but Aladdin wasn't sidelined.Naomi Scott was great. Jasmine was fleshed out in this ""modern"" version and the character could've easily come out as a petty feminist portrayal but it didn't. Scott showed a fierce Jasmine but with a realistic development from fearful to fearless. Will Smith had a different but entertaining version of Genie. His musical numbers were the best part of the movie.Marwan Kenzari (Jafar), acting-wise, at least as how Guy Ritchie interpreted his character as subtle evil, was good. He did have Jafar vibes in his voice and has a sociopathic stare. I wasn't expecting the OG Jafar persona because that's just too comical for live-action and would end up as Hook or the Wolf in their respective live-action movies which would look cheap tbh. I like how Disney are humanizing their villains, particularly showing their motivations and not just evil for evil's sake. Jafar's parallel to Aladdin was a good addition. Another change that I like is the irony in the way he requested his 3rd wish, *desperately begged* to be the most powerful as opposed to highly commanding the Genie in the OG.The soundtrack instrumentals were better than the original in my opinion. The additional arabian musical elements just made them better. The vocals weren't on par to the original but compared to other remakes, they have much more personality in them. Speechless was good, although it did stick out from the other songs. It has arabian elements too if you pay attention closely but hearing it inside the movie, it felt like a Camp Rock song. ""Proud of Your Boy"" should've been added so Aladdin would have a personal goal like Jasmine. Also, if they wanted the last fight to be all serious, they could've rearranged ""Prince Ali Reprise"" to fit the new ""serious"" Jafar.The CGI was fine, except for the lack of Abu and Iago scenes, and Jafar sorcery. They were obviously saving budget for specific parts and excluded unnecessary CGI. The pacing was too slow sometimes, but nothing significant to ruin the scenes.All in all, it was a movie with visuals, choreo, and music as its strengths and the impossibility to translate entertaining cartoonish personas (which people loved about the original) into live-action as its weakness.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

"Not close to the original, but kids like this live update.","The first few times I watched this I found it somewhat painful because I compared it to the humor and tone of the animated film. This movie at (many) times feels like bad cable network quality acting and action scenes. Our five-year-old has recently compared the two films and far prefers the live action one with Will Smith. The actor who plays ""Prince Ali/Aladdin"" is charming at times and just darn painfully goofy at other times (can't sing). I like Will Smith, but he feels awkwardly both out-of-control and then painfully restrained at times.Reviews of other characters are so-so at best. Action scenes look like a bad show at a Disney park.But all this aside, our 5 year old loves the story and characters here... perhaps kids ages 3-12 will love this update.

Pity I can't say the same about our hero, Aladdin (Mena Massoud), and his love interest, the princess Jasmine (Naomi Scott). None of these two young actors have much film experience and I didn't find them (Aladdin especially) strong enough to carry the film. There was no chemistry between them. (If there were chemistry between any of the characters, it would be between Aladdin and the Genie). The acting was unconvincing and left me cold. I felt nothing. Personally, I thought Aladdin was a stupid character and didn't really root for him.Will Smith was by far the main attraction, from a comedy perspective, and from an interesting character perspective. He even had the most interesting back story. Of everyone in the film, I cared most about him.The production design is superb and the musical segments are stunning!

The Jasmine character was good, beautiful girl and great singer, but still could have had a better actress. The actor who plays Aladdin was absolutely brilliant. He really embodied the character adding a lot more humour which was great. And what to say about Will Smith? I thought he was excellent. He never tried to copy Robin Williams portrayal of the genie, he made it his own while still capturing all the genie's traits. And I like they slightly changed the story of the genie a little bit.

Better than the Original,"The original has AN EDGE with Robin Williams' brilliant, comedic, perfectly cadenced, impression-filled voiceover performance, but overall, I have to give THE EDGE to this better packaged version. While Smith doesn't manage to match Williams' charm, his portrayal of the Genie is more than satisfactory, bringing his own approach to fast-talking, and his ""jive"" charm to the equation.What makes all the difference here is the more fleshed out story, and the more fleshed out characters. The stakes carry a broader spectrum to make the peril much heavier. Then when you look at Aladdin, Jasmine, Jafar, and yes, the Genie, you see so many more layers, and greater relatability than before.

Setting The Tone For More Disney Live Action Remakes,"Aladdin is about a guy named Aladdin who gets hired to do a job that requires him to get the lamp of the genie.

I think the Little Mermaid will be like this. I went into this wanting one thing and getting another. I though the songs were good. I really enjoyed listing to them. Also the acting I thought was good. I was entertained when watching the actor. I thought will smith did a good job. When he was the genie he was acting like Robin Williams and when he was himself he acted like well, himself. It was better when he acted like himself. Those were the good things. I didn't really like the make-up. Somebody was kidnapped in a bag and he was perfectly clean. Also in the chase scenes the town looked pretty clean. Also some of the action and dance scenes were speed up. It was really noticeable too. I really don't know why they did that. Also the CGI wasn't the best.

"Better than expected, but ...","I was dreading the idea of watching this.. one of my favorite movies of all time wasn't looking to be making the transition to live action worth my while... the film proved me wrong.. but it did do something previous remakes didn't.. make me question why it was necessary
The bad: Will Smith's Genie has his moments.. but definitely not when he's singing... but he's not too far behind the leads.. Aladdin is flat and can barely reach the notes and although Naomi Scott shines the brightest, her vocals just can't reach the quality of the Score..
The Good: Visually incredible.. lavish sets, gorgeous costumes, and special effects bring the magic to life. The story tweaks work well, the cast, aside from singing, do a fantastic job of bringing the classic characters to lifeBut outside of the incredible score, upgraded to an epic degree by Alan Menken.. very little of the movie really justifies why it needed to be made. This could be said about the remakes that preceded.. but they offered enough to keep me from questioning their existence. I still look forward to coming remakes, but they do need to start finding their own identity.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Stick with the original,"None of the magic, chemistry, charisma, or comedic timing of the original Disney version was present here. Will Smith was the perfect choice for the genie, but they kept the reins on him for some reason. And, in typical Disney fashion, they PC'd the tar out of this one as they've been doing with all of their sequels and remakes over the last several years. Other appealing elements from the original were simply left out entirely. Iago, for example, was a funny character in the 90's version, but pretty much just a normal parrot in this one. Abu?

"Much anticipated, did not disappoint","24 June 2019
First Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Aladdin. I've really been looking forward to this film. Lover of Disney I'm enjoying the transition from animation to live action. I read a lot in the press and on social media about the good and bad points of Will Smith playing the Genie. He has in no way spoiled the memory of Robin Williams, instead he has brought his own level of blue to role, giving us the familiar character with the Will Smith twist. Mena Massoud who plays Aladdin could literally be the animated version brought to life, it was so like the original Disney character. The new arrangement of the songs was sympathetic to the originals, Abu and carpet were still a great double act and the opulence of Agraba was grand even in poverty.

Big big disappointment,"The original was a ""chef-d'oeuvre"", a masterpiece, and either Disney would make this one completely different, or recreate it with a big ""chabang"" of color, acting, singing and interpretation.
Who chose the actors? The acting was bad, Will Smith as the genie??? Everyone agrees that reenact Robin Williams would be a though task, Will Smith has done some great things but here failed completely.
Jaffar, that powerful imponent deceitful character, again, I'm sorry, Mr Kenzari wasn't up to the task.
The scenery was bad, I mean, it would be acceptable for a Sunday morning Disney channel, 8 to 10 year old audience, not for a movie theater motion picture. The singing like wise, awful, no emotion.
Disney has a big task ahead to redeem itself. This is far from your standards.",1.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Poor Iago,"There were a lot of good things about this movie and a lot of bad things. I guess it equals to everything being okay. The opening song ""One Jump Ahead"" is easily the best part of the movie. They get some new characters or replacement characters and they're honestly quite good. The Genie gets a human love interest and it's resolved in a very clever manner. We get more insight on Jafar with how he wants to conquer other kingdoms.Now here's the negatives. Iago was one of the funniest characters in the original and he's waaay less entertaining here. I remember the awesome climax in the original with Jafar turning into a giant snake and the Genie rooting Aladdin on! Here, none of that happens.

"Viewing this and judging it with no regard for Disney's original Aladdin, this live action remake is actually a decent watch","Fun, exciting, dazzling...really, this live action remake is actually a fresh and decent remake of Disney's original Aladdin, albeit with a few adjustments to fit a better narrative for this film. Almost nothing can stop anyone from enjoying this film, except of course if they let the original Disney animated cloud their judgement, or take the movie too seriously, et al.The story, cast, acting, setting, are all decent, maybe not much of fleshing out of side characters such as Iago, but it did a good job of entertaining and retelling the story of Aladdin (One Thousand and One Nights) with an actual live cast. Will Smith, in particular, actually does a good job of portraying a fun and playful genie.Of course, musicals such as these are an acquired taste, but as much as possible, watch this like you're imagining the original Aladdin story be retold and done in another manner and perspective, with Disney's usual magical and adventurous twists.

A Visually Stunning but Lacking in Magic,"Guy Ritchie's live-action adaptation of Disney's ""Aladdin"" delivers a fun and entertaining experience, but it falls short of capturing the magic of the original animated classic.The film boasts a stellar performance by Will Smith, who brings his own unique flair to the role of the Genie. Smith's charisma and comedic timing breathe life into the character, providing many of the film's most memorable moments. Naomi Scott shines as Jasmine, delivering a strong and beautiful portrayal that adds depth to her character. Marwan Kenzari, while competent as Jafar, doesn't quite capture the menacing presence that made the original villain so iconic.Mena Massoud, as Aladdin, brings warmth and charm to the role of the small-time thief with a heart of gold. His chemistry with Naomi Scott is palpable, and together they create some enchanting moments. The supporting characters, including the mischievous monkey Abu and the sinister macaw Iago, add to the film's charm and humor.Visually, ""Aladdin"" is a feast for the eyes. The vibrant colors, elaborate costumes, and detailed set designs bring the fictional city of Agrabah to life. The musical numbers are visually spectacular, with grand choreography and dynamic camera work that make them a joy to watch.However, the film does have its shortcomings. The new songs introduced in this adaptation don't quite blend seamlessly with the beloved classics from the original. They feel somewhat out of place and lack the same timeless quality. Additionally, some of the humor feels forced, missing the mark more often than not.The film also struggles with pacing and character development. Key moments of character growth and interaction feel rushed, leading to a lack of emotional depth. The changes made to the story and the addition of new characters sometimes feel unnecessary and disrupt the flow of the narrative.Moreover, the visual effects, while impressive in many scenes, fall short in others. Some CGI elements look dated and detract from the overall experience. The film's spectacle doesn't quite match the impact of the original animated version, making it feel less magical and memorable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

My favourite scene from the movie when the song plays ""the whole new world""

Will Smith. -Genie
Marwan kenzari. -Jefer
Nasim pedrad. -Dalia
Billy magnussen. -Prince AndersMena massoud(Aladdin) was absolutely charming he carried the character with the flow.
His stunts were marvelous and eye catching!
Noami Scott she played her all the scenes gracefully the shocking part was that she sang a song in this movie and her voice was so pleasingly beautiful.
And the one who never goes wrong when it's time for some entertainment its played by
will Smith(genie)who can make every wish possible! Woot woot!

It's a mix genre of romantic, musical ,action, drama, adventure family and comedy.
It's a pack of entertainment.
Family movie.

Aladdin,"A faithful remake of a childhood classic that could easily be seen as cannon just like all the other remakes they have made so far. Naomi Scott and Mena Massoud's performance does the characters justice and sang their hearts out with conviction. Will Smith's inclusion, however questionable, it is also hard to come up with anyone more suitable for the role. The costumes and exotic settings makes the film more authentic and awe-inspiring than ever before. The film doesn't really do anything new, so perhaps the film is more suitable for the younger generation who is approaching these stories for the first time. But we can rest easy know that the kids of our next generation is still absorbing these wondrous stories, just through different mediums.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Deeply surprising in how enjoyable it is.,"Disney live action remakes of classic animation are often re-worked to respond to criticism lobbed at the films over the decade. (or in the case of Dumbo criticism lobbed at Disney generally). This reached peak absurdity in Beauty and the Beast where the live action film went out of its way to try to respond to every bad faith criticism anyone ever made. (i.e. trying to explain why the servants were also punished, does Belle suffer from Stockholm Syndrome? etc.) Aladdin doesn't quite escape this tendency but it largely ignores some of the really bad hot takes that exist around the film I.e. This fantasy land isn't very much like the Middle East, Why did Aladdin get punished for Abu's mistake? Etc. The changes they made to the story-aging up Jasmine and giving her more to do, giving the Genie more agency in the climax/story, a complete re-write of Arabian Nights-felt germane and organic to the story. Most are neutral, and a few were for the better. (I like the part the Genie plays in the climax much more). It really felt like the same story.It is for this reason the film is very entertaining. The technical aspects are utterly gorgeous. The film is a charming take on setting and the film is as delightful for the senses as such classics as The Thief of Baghdad. The musical sequences land and the cast does a great job with the songs. Richie directs everything with evident glee and everyone is clearly having fun. I must say that Massoud is just perfect for the role. He is sexy, charming and embodies the diamond in the rough.The big question, of course, is WIll Smith. I like his Genie and they wisely stayed away from trying to replicate Williams. Smith's Genie is entirely his own. He seemed to be channeling his Fresh Prince persona for the role. It works. The character is not as iconic, powerful, or humorous as Williams' turn but it is no mere serviceable stand in either. Smith makes the character his own and you stop thinking about Williams about 5 minutes after he shows up.This is a fun film. One of the better Disney live action remakes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

"I wish I could say it was better but... wait, I'm not going to waste a wish on that.","'Aladdin (2019)' is the first of Disney's live-action remakes I've seen. While it isn't bad, I will admit that it does seem a little pointless. It makes a few changes to the original story, mostly surrounding the character of Jasmine, and obviously reinterprets things through its own lens, but the foundation remains the same. Its superficial switch-ups seem just that: superficial. The stuff surrounding Jasmine is a nice touch, though. The film itself starts off pretty slow. It's not terrible, but it stumbles a bit and doesn't pick itself back up until the Genie is introduced. Of course, you do have to adjust to Smith's larger-than-life interpretation of the character. You have to adjust to the CGI, too, which slips into the 'Uncanny valley' every now and then. When you've done this, however, the flick becomes rather entertaining, dipping into pseudo rom-com territory to pleasing effect. This portion of the piece is good enough that the somewhat lesser third act doesn't dampen the experience. I think this is primarily because it sees the successful completion of several previously established character arcs. Most of these are believable and rather fulfilling, though a couple seem to be somewhat artificial in the wider context of their characters. In the end, though, the movie is fairly fun. To be honest, the best thing about it is the music, which sticks in your head long after the credits have rolled. Most of the songs aren't new, though, which does further compound the fact that the whole thing is rather unnecessary (they sound pretty 'auto tune'-heavy, too). Also, some of the musical sequences are ripped straight out of the first 'Aladdin (1992)', almost shot for shot. Still, an entertaining time isn't to be balked at.

You WILL fall in love with the GENIE and definitely start hating parrots!,"Okay, here's the rule. We wont discuss about the visual effects because its Disney's work and it can't be anything less than brilliant.
I grew up watching Aladdin and I expected nothing less than this, although I believe that the most anticipated character of the movie could have been introduced 20 minutes earlier in the film and so, I advise you all to have a little patience till the 40th minute and then have your mind blown away by the never ending exciting journey.
As expected the character of Jasmine was nothing less than fabulous and Aladdin was as convincing as it could be as street rat (my bad, I know he hates this title). Loved the monkey and the PARROT. Oh man! It was as abhorring as it's master Jaffar, even worse than him. Gosh! I have started hating parrots.The last twenty minutes will make up for a little slow beginning of the film (of course I understand, a bit of time is definitely needed for introducing the characters of the famous ""Arabian Nights"" - I totally get it......PAUSE........NOT).Worth every second and penny invested to witness this cinematic marvel!",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Predictably underwhelming,"I watched this with my 4 year old nephew, it was his first big screen ""big kid"" movie. I ended up convincing myself to stay and not use the child as an excuse.

I was hoping to create a memory, similar to my first ""big kid"" movie, The Little Mermaid, but I knew going into it from my previous experience with Beauty and the Beast, that this was going to be another assault on my childhood and wallet! I'd like to see Disney use their vast wealth and power to create NEW stories from distant history! Instead of stealing old ideas from their own cutting room floors! I wouldn't bother spending any more money at Disney movies! They continue to flounder on other people's ideas and drown in everyone's childhoods!",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Very pleasantly surprised,"I love the 1992 Aladdin movie (and have fond memories of the first sequel with Jafar the Genie as well), so when Disney inevitably announced the live action remake of it I was cautiously intrigued. Their previous live action remakes of their animated classics have mostly been a decent enough experience to watch but only a few of them really managed to stand out as fantastic, which in my opinion very much include Beauty and the Beast as possibly the best of them all which could arguably also be said of its animated forerunner.My interest quickly faded when Guy Ritchie was announced as the director as I had a hard time picturing him slapping together anything close to what the original movie was with his somewhat unique style of directing and editing. I love some of his older movies, but besides the whole ""street-rat, orphaned hero thief"" which fit his usual narrative, nothing else seemed to fit between the two. And when Will Smith was cast as the Genie my expectations plummeted. I love Will Smith but he has zero range as an actor and never really manages to portray anything but the Fresh Prince, just in different situations (although to be fair I have seen him in a few films where he showed both range and great talent instead of smug charme, but they are few and far between).However this movie turned out to be as much of a copy/paste remake as Beauty and the Beat, which is not meant as a bad thing but a very good one. The cast was outstanding, although the Aladdin took some getting used to, and the few changes the movie did to the original story was well done. All the original music remains within the new movie, sung by the new cast and while it never reach the same level as the original movie in most cases, it almost nails it but makes up for it more than once by amazing dance coordination, costume and set designs.Most surprisingly was certainly Will Smith, who from the start had the impossible task of taking over Genie from the late great Robin Williams. But his natural charming persona and comedy chops serves him well here, and instead of trying to emulate Williams in his portrayal, he combines the usual charm and smug confidence of the Fresh Prince with the emotional and fatherly touch he has tapped into since he seemingly became comfortable in his role as a father in real life. And while he might not be remembered for decades for being the Genie as much as Robin Williams was, he certainly managed to create something just as memorable.Taste is taste, some people seem to dislike it quite a bit which I find suspiciously strange if they enjoyed the original movie, but instead of listening to them or me, I recommend seeing the movie and make up your own mind.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
This was a weird film,"Full disclosure, I have never watched the original Aladdin. Disney wasn't a huge part of my childhood, and my opinion is from a blind perspective. For this remake of a Disney classic, I bring no baggage to the table.I found this movie very...weird. Through most of it,something seemed off; you can't really place it; all the pieces of a scene are done well,but they don't gel cohesively. This wasn't adapted well. I'm always aware that this movie isn't real and trying to be cartoony. But that's the point - if you don't believe the world you're in, you can't really buy anything it sells. The signing and music felt forced, the acting was overdone, the plot wasn't convincing, the characters weren't believable and the ending seemed rushed.They give you an exact replica, which doesn't work because the audience isn't the same. This is the kind of movie, where if you stopped and thought about what's happening in a scene, you're completely taken out of it. And that shouldn't happen in a movie about magic.Speaking of magic, any positive feedback I had , goes to Will Smith as the genie.
He doesn't take a Robin Williams route, but plays himself instead. Any scene with him is elevated; he holds up the entire second act. This Genie was the only believable part of this story, which kinda sucks because I wanted to enjoy everything else too.So there you have it, my unbiased opinion .

Will Smith is no Robin Williams,"But that's fine.Will is the best part of the movie, he doesn't even pretend to emulate Robin at all, instead he brings up a touch of fresh prince (pun intended) which give a nice spin on the Genie.Jazmine (Nahomi Scott) is also great.

She brought and extra dose of comedy which was very well done.What's really dissapointing is Marwan Kenzari as Jafar. At no point does he seem powerful or even menacing. More like a spoiled brat.Still, the movie delivers. The costumes are great, the photography, the singing, the music, the setting. Only the CGI genie falls short, but its still fine. (BTW Will Smith said in an interview that every scene where he's shown as blue, its CGI, so there's that)Do I like it better than the original?

I was so excited to see this because I thought I was going to see a different take on the story or at least a more expanded version of dialogue, perhaps written to be more appealing to adults.

Flawed but fun and beautiful.,"We all have those childhood movies that hold a special place in our hearts. Well for me it was the one-two punch of Aladdin and The Lion King; 7-year-old Troy's eyes being opened to the wonders of cinema through two classic Disney adventures. There's no possible way for me to consider the animated Aladdin with any sort of objectivity - in my eyes it's perfect - which in turn makes it extremely hard to judge this live-action remake as anything but paling in comparison. Putting those impossible comparisons (and inevitable conclusion) aside, Guy Ritchie's take on this rags-to-riches tale is energetic, vibrant and largely a load of fun, albeit with a few missteps. Taking it in a Bollywood-esque direction is a great choice, allowing Ritchie to lean heavily into stunning musical set pieces with grand sets and even grander costumes; the biggest and most beautiful spectacle coming from the magnificent 'Prince Ali' sequence. There's a new song too, Jasmine's solo-effort 'Speechless' a powerful ode to her under-valued strength in a male-dominated world. It encapsulates this film's overall stronger focus on Jasmine (stunningly played by Naomi Scott), who proves to be a more interesting character than the titular street-rat. Mena Massoud is both charming and physically convincing as our protagonist, put through his paces as Ritchie bolsters the action stakes where possible; the parkour-inspired 'One Jump Ahead' a fun introduction to the nimble-thief hero despite the occasionally awkward lyric delivery. The big blue elephant in the room is undoubtedly Will Smith's Genie though. Whilst the performance is fine, the computer-generated visual execution is shockingly bad and at times downright creepy due to the dreadful face replacement technology. Smith still manages to bring a bit of his trademark swagger and when Genie and Aladdin are exchanging witty banter there are plenty of amusing moments, but these are mostly worthy of smiles rather than belly laughs. It's certainly no classic, but this live-action Aladdin is a mostly enjoyable flick for kids and adults alike.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Reinventing the wheel,"Who would in his right mind have ever dreamed ten years ago that a director like Guy Ritchie could do a Disney musical? I mean it's like expecting Quentin Tarantino to make a Star Trek movie. Wait a minute...
Anyhow the reality is this - a new Aladdin movie is in theaters now and it is spectacular. Ritchie's trademarks are all here: long shots, slow motion, colorful picture and eloquent dialogues but no matter how hard the master tries to reinvent the wheel it doesn't overdo the far superior original and here's why.
First, it's Will Smith and his questionable visual representation as the blue Genie. No one expected him to be another Robin Williams because it's impossible but Will just doesn't even try to be a Genie we used to know. He's simply being himself, and the superpowers don't make him any convincing as he ought to have been if only he tried a little harder.
Second, it's the actor who plays Jafar, the main villain who is there to serve its purpose of being a villain. Given the two lines of his background story I nevertheless was not able to answer why is he actually evil because of Marwan Kerzani's superficial performance.
And third, it's the length of the movie - some scenes are obscenely long and overburdened with special effects it makes your eyes sore.
But overall this is a different yet magnificent take on the beloved fairytale with great songs (especially ""Speechless"" which just won my heart), stunning visuals, stellar main cast performances and very meaningful redefinition of personal values and self-acception.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

A Respectable and Enjoyable Adaption,"Though nothing can top the original animated film I feel like this one was a fun live action adaption. Granted, everyone knows that Disney's live action remakes of their classic animated films are hit and miss at times, but 2019's Aladdin was definitely one of their better ones. Having Guy Ritchie as the director was an odd choice since he usaully doesn't direct musicals but with Alan Menken as the composer again it helped.As for the casting in this movie; Will Smith literally stole the show in this film and made the Genie his own while still respecting the late Robin Williams. Mena Massoud was grear choice as Aladdin and the fact that he can sing makes his portrayal even better. Naomi Scott was so beautiful and truly shined as Princess Jasmine. The new character, Dahlia, Jasmine's handmaiden was a nice addition to the remake as well.Now lets talk about the biggest elephant in the room and that's Marwan Kenzari portrayal as Jafar. Kenzari delivered a pretty wooden performance as this iconic Walt Disney villain which disappointed me a lot. In my opinion, Oded Fehr who played Jafar in the Disney live action series Once Upon a Time did a far better job and probably should've been in this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
don't tess the original!! the original mate laters!!,The original is still the best. Robin Williams as genie laters. Robin Williams as the genie was the one single handed role that made Voice acting attractive to the big actors. that opening sequence in the cave in the original. you can't that! anyway the other big thing is the Aladdin of the new couldn't act!!! the new jasmine was amazing. aesthetically as well her acting. sum up new Aladdin actor and new jafar ruined.,1.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Mostly good with 4 qualms,"The movie was very enjoyable and I had a smile on my face for most of the time. The actors who portrayed Jasmine and Aladdin shocked me with their acting abilities for being not well known. Finally the Bollywood/Hip-hop dance scene to close rocked. However, I had 4 qualms1. The original had some, obviously, very cartoonish movements of the characters. Specifically when Aladdin is running through the streets. This was unable to be replicated, so they used some very bad CGI to either speed him up or allow him to do inhuman motions. You're spending all the money anyway, just pay for some good freaking CGI2. jazmin's song ""speechless"" was unnecessarily trying to let the viewer know that Disney is now ""woke"" and grind at the movie's plot to a halt3. The original had some modern pop culture references that made the movie incredibly unique for this type of a Disney movie, and this movie did not have those. They were missed4. I know that it is unfair to compare will smith to Robin Williams as an actor. But as a singer, Smith also just doesn't compare. Some of the songs such as Arabian nights and prince Ali required kind of an operatic tone which Williams had. Will smith just kind of bumbled and rapped his way through them.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

"A fun live action update of the animated original, despite struggling to justify its existence","Aladdin is a fantasy film based on the 1992 animated Disney film of the same name (itself based on the Middle Eastern folk tale ""Aladdin and the Magic Lamp""). Directed by Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, Sherlock Holmes), it is a fun live action update of the animated original, despite struggling to justify its existence.In the city of Agrabah, Aladdin (Mena Massoud), a good natured street thief, is recruited by the Sultan's Grand Vizier Jafar (Marwan Kenzari) to search inside a cave for a mysterious magic lamp. Upon finding the lamp, Aladdin is betrayed by Jafar and is left die when he inadvertently frees the Genie of the Lamp (Will Smith). The eccentric Genie declares Aladdin his new master and tells him that he can grant him three wishes for just about anything, including the social status to marry the Sultan's daughter Princess Jasmine (Naomi Scott).With its catchy music and nice setpieces, the live action Aladdin is a respectful update of the 1992 film, but unfortunately this is not nearly enough. Many years from now, it will be the original animated film people will be intending to see instead of this one. While some live action Disney remakes can bring something new and exciting to the story, such as Dumbo and The Jungle Book, this version of Aladdin does very little that has not been done before. The songs are the same, the plot is the same, and the character motivations are the same. The cast does a reasonable job, with Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott as Aladdin and Princess Jasmine, respectively working well together due to their believable chemistry. Will Smith also injects his trademark wittiness and likeability into his performance as the Genie, but never once does he come close to topping the late great Robin Williams. However, Marwan Kenzari seems too young to be playing Jafar, as this role would be better suited to someone closer in age to the Sultan himself, likely around middle age. The one thing I feel this film did somewhat better than the original is the romance between Aladdin and Princess Jasmine. The 1992 version went with the typical ""falling in love after one day"" trope whereas in this one, the audience can actually feel their love blossoming over time. Aside from that, this remake is inessential for the most part.I rate it 6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Still got that magic,It was good I know I'm late to the party to post a review but I liked it. It's great film for the family or just anyone that wants to watch something with a happy ending. I must admit I never saw the orginal Aladdin so been nice to go in not knowing completely what happens. I think the casting of will Smith was the best part about this film he made the role his own and makes it shine and it's all the little things to like the fly carpet is just smile maker whenever it did something quirky it made me smile and chuckle. My only negative thing I had to say about this film is the singing. I just found the actor to play Aladdin just didnt have that stand out voice in my opinion but jasmine my god what a voice!!

WYLION - Feel good?,"Unpopular opinion but I liked this movie.Was it great? No, but it did make you feel good. That's what I class it as, a feel good movie. The acting wasn't amazing it was okay. Will Smith's performance was most certainly the best in the movie even if the large CGI version of the Genie was very distracting, over the top and took away from everything around it.I think what made the movie not work was trying to transfer everything from the animation across to live action. This would be alright for something such as The Lion King (which I am very excited for by the way). The difference is that there is magic, transformation and so many effects that it removes the 'live action' from a live action movie. Not CGI specifically but all of the particle effects really just didn't make it have a real feel to it which is required for a live action movie. I think Guy Richie may have gotten carried away and because of the direction he went with the movie I think it is the explanation for why the movie and the acting came across quite bland.I won't trash talk the movie too much though as I liked it a lot and I know it will be one I watch more than once or even twice.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
An astonishing failure,"It is now a trend. The big budget segment of the film industry is so full of CGI and (in this case) making sure that just the right kind of diversity (and nothing else) dominated, they forget how to write literate, funny scripts.This was a strictly connect-the-dots production. Both leading roles were oddly hollow. The genie not believable. Jafar as threatening as an aggressive usher. I read the press materials about the triumph of making it a point to cast people who look like they're from the region. But then what? Put San Fernando Valley English into their mouths?And what English? Every scene was predictable. Sometimes even the next line was predictable. For all that production money, they should have hired a literate someone to fix the script.A grievous waste.",1.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

"A Decent Adaptation of the Disney Classic, No More but No Less","With any remake, one of the key questions is: Do you stick to the source material and get called unoriginal? Or do you go your own way and get accused of blaspheming the classic property? Guy Ritchie (who pulls double duty, as a screenwriter and the director) and his team chose the 2nd option. To my surprise, the movie is better for it. They give Jasmine more depth and a stronger motivation, they add in a handmaiden character Dalia (Nasim Pedrad) who brings some warmth to the Jasmine's plight. Will Smith's Genie isn't a carbon copy of the Robin Williams version, they keep enough of what made that character so memorable but Will gets to add his flavour to it and it largely works. They also make minor changes the ending but it never feels false or unearned. I hate it when movies just ignore source material (The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies comes to mind) but I think they made some choices and most of them payed off. If you're going to make that kind of deviation, it better be good and hats off to them for making the correct decision.The original Aladdin is a classic for so many reasons but I always go back to 2 things, the character of the Genie (voiced and performed by Robin Williams in a masterful job) and the music. Once again, they weren't just content to recycle the music (although every musical number from the original film is in the movie) and they tweak the numbers and add a couple of new ones. The movie is more mixed here, most of the music is alright (A Whole New World, One Jump are both done justice) but a couple of the numbers are a little off. Will Smith is a movie star and a rapper but he is still not a great singer and while Friend Like Me is still solid, Arabian Nights and Prince Ali have some cringe-worthy moments. He doesn't fail and it could have sounded worse, but I still wish it had been better in those areas.Aladdin largely looks good, the CGI on it passes the test. I liked the effects with Carpet and Abu which could have been so easy to screw up. It would be more of a surprise if it looked crappy, the budget on this is high and with the might of ""The Mouse"" behind it, it looks the part. I also liked how the musical numbers and action were filmed, Guy Ritchie does a better job fitting into this genre than I thought he would of and both the action and the dancing is well choreographed and filmed. There is one moment where he has to use his slow motion effects and it just made me laugh. It was like he just couldn't help himself. But otherwise, Aladdin is well shot and looks the part.Will Smith is the big name in the cast, and maybe I'm a little biased, but the most important because the Genie might be my favourite character in the Disney cannon. Will does as good of a job as could be expected, he's not fantastic but he's a lot better than people were predicting. He's able to put his spin on the character and it works more than it doesn't. I liked both Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott as Aladdin and Jasmine respectively. Neither wowed me but they both were good in every respect. Marwan Kenzari was surprisingly effective as Jafar, he chews the scenery but I think he walked that line without going too far (you could make a drinking game out of his performance, take a shot every time he yells into nothing). I also really liked Nasim Pedrad as Dalia. She's grounding for the movie and she helps keep things light. Navid Negahban gets very little to do as the Sultan so I can't really comment either way.This is a decent adaptation of an animated movie that borders on being a masterpiece. I saw this with my family and everyone pretty much had the same reaction. It takes two steps forward and one step back, the movie has an odd construction where things don't always fit from scene to scene. It feels like in an effort to keep the pace up, they threw things together in the editing booth and maybe overdid it by cutting too much out. Otherwise this version of Aladdin gets the job done, the animated release is the better movie hands down but I wouldn't mind watching this again. It could have been better but this gets the job done and it was better than expected.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Doesn't have the same magic as the original,"First of all, like all the other live-action remakes of classic Disney films, this one has changes to it and one of them was good and the rest was kinda bad. The only good one is what they did with Jasmine. Naomi Scott was incredible as Jasmine and played her to absolute perfection to her abilities. But the thing I want to talk about is what they did with her character. Instead of keeping her the same as her animated counterpart they changed her so she better fit a strong female that should be seen more in film. She also had the best song in the entire film and I hope it gets nominated for best original song for the Oscars. The set design in this film was outstanding and just looked spectacular on the big screen. All of the sets looked like it was taken right out of the animated film and just increased. The costume design was also really good. Even though we already knew who the common people were and the royalty it still showed the status difference. Although I did hate how they made Aladdin have clean clothes. Now, the original songs are classics and everybody knows them and I hate how they changed some of the lyrics mainly with ""One Jump Ahead"" and ""Prince Ali"". I do understand why they changed them to help fit the story but with ""Prince Ali"" one of the lyrics was changed and it pissed me off. I talked about how Naomi Scott is great as Jasmine but for the rest of the actors, it wasn't the same. Now, I'm not going to hate on Will Smith as the Genie because he did accept a tough challenge of taking over for the legendary Robin Williams and he did make it his own but my main probably was with Mena Massoud and Marwan Kenzari, who plays Jafar. Mena Massoud was a decent Aladdin what he lacked was the singing ability but I will give him credit for putting himself out there. But, Marwan Kenzari just didn't do it for me as Jafar. He pretty much was a boring villain who was two-dimensional. There were two big scene changes that just bugged me all because it affected the story and those were the opening scene and the ending. The opening made no sense because it was out of order and the ending just was a completely different ending that sucked. This film does keep the original message of always be yourself but it messes it up with one thing. Also, the CGI in this film is just bad. Nothing CGI really looked realistic in any way. There were lots of scenes in this film that awkwardly ended and transitioned to the next with no proper connection. I'm not sure if it was just me but the humour in this film was kinda weak. The score by Alan Menken was good at least. In the end, Aladdin (2019) doesn't have the same magic as the original animated one and shouldn't have been touched at all. It's a good kids film but for people who grew up with the original, it's not that good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Aladdin is held up only by it's cast.,"I was excited to see this movie, despite all the negative publicity it was getting. Having seen it, I can say it was worth admission at least. It's held up by the great chemistry between Mena Massoud and Will Smith. And believe it or not, Will Smith's ""Friend Like Me"" was the best part of the movie. Will Smith brings his own charm to the table that separates him from Robin Williams, and creates a new equally likeable genie. The music was just as good all around, and some new additions were welcome as well. And with the beautiful visuals, and great female empowerment moment at the end that was missing from the original, this was almost a great win for Disney. It falls short with some sloppy editing, especially when it speeds up the film during some songs. I'm not kidding, it looked like the video was fast forwarding, but the music was still on key. This was supposedly done for absolutely no logical reason. While it can never match up to the original's magic, it certainly can exist and survive on it's own merits.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

"Shining, Shimmering, not that Splendid","I came into the theater to watch this movie not as a Disney fan nor of the original Aladdin but as a fan of Guy Ritchie. And I must say I was not disappointed. His style is recognizable in some parts of the movie with slow motion shots, running in alleys and parkour in a way that give this version of Aladdin almost a British gritty aspect as Ritchie would do. I was mostly impressed with the latter's versatility by the ""whole new world"" which he created. This live-action remake is very colorful and very pleasing to the eyes even though the cinematography is not constantly solid but it was compensated with aesthetics by the production. Also it should be noted that Will Smith's version of the genie was very unique and he was able to give it his touch making him one of the most if not the most imposing character on screen. As soon as he appears he almost gives a second life to the movie that was much needed. Which leads me to my last praise, this was wayyy funnier than i expected it to be. Will Smith's performance and lines had a whole part of the cinema laughing out loud at multiple occasions.
On the other hand there was quite a few things that could have been improved on. For example there are many instances where I could not help but pay too much attention to the CGI Abu (which weirdly actually appears as a real monkey on frame making the CGI version look even worse), or a few greenscreen shots (i'm guessing) running on rooftops being quite janky. My major complaint though would be the casting for Jafar. While i do think that Marwan Kenzari did a good job with the character i just feel that an actor with a more ominous look and voice would have definitely worked a lot better like his co-star who played Hakim ( Numan Acar). It should be noted that a few of the scenes acted by Naomi Scott and Mena Massoud were a bit cringeworthy but they did seem like they were having fun playing those characters.
Overall, i think the positives outweigh the negatives by a bit and that the movie does not appear quite as magical as the original did but that is because the bar was set extremely high.I would rate this movie a 6.5/10 !!",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Well it's better than Beauty and The Beast,"So, I did something I try not to do. I went into this movie with a negative mindset.Beauty and The Beast was such a disappointment, I figured this would be as well. Colour me surprised, ALADDIN 2019, actually has some heart to it.Up front, the strength of this film falls squarely on the shoulders of our two leads, Aladdin (Mena Massoud) and Jasmine (Naomi Scott). The former feels like the animation come to life (it's a bit scary how good he is) and the latter adds depth, development and character to Jasmine, that makes her feel like a woman of the 21st Century. It doesn't hurt that the chemistry between them is off the charts.The songs are mostly, very well done, and you'll be singing along in no time and the little changes here and there to the original story, actually help close up some plot holes, we only noticed as adults.It's far from perfection though. Will Smith is a charismatic guy, and he does his best to live up to Robin William's legacy, while making the Genie his own. But, there's cheese to be found on this sandwich, and some of his moments fall really flat.It doesn't help that the CG isn't that great, and the location does look very much like a set and not a real place.Jafar was also a huge let down. He's just a villain and doesn't have any of that sly, seductive, sleazy fun stuff, that his animated predecessor did. Also, don't get me started on the giant parrot. You'll see what I mean.I honestly don't think, any of these 'adaptations' will live up to the animated magic that Disney once bestowed on us. I'm really torn about putting my money behind, what feels like a cash grab scheme.

"Aladdin 2019: My Good, Bad, and Ugly","The Good:
Disney's latest live action remake is a Colorful, and nostalgic imagining that does justice to the animated original. The use of colors in the 1992 was selective and mainly isolated to the film's main characters set against the sand tones of the desert and of Agrabah. But, in Ritchie's selection the settings and costumes both pop with color reminiscent of the films of Bollywood. With little in the way of expanded story, or more complex characters than its predecessor, this film is vibrant and kinetic and speaks to the cinematic value of live action over animation.The Bad:
With about 38 minutes more runtime than the animated original, this film didn't add much to set itself above, or even apart from, the original. While it has obviously proved successful for the studio with other live action remakes, like The Jungle Book (Jon Favreau, 2016), and Beauty and the Beast (Bill Condon, 2017), these films are little more than cookie cutter copies of their originals. A few new songs wrapped in all of the familiar ones, and a lot of rehashed dialogue veils an almost complete lack of originality in a film that doesn't accomplish much more than repackaging an animated classic for box office receipts.The Ugly:
One of Disney's first forays into direct adaptation of one of its earlier animated classics is Cinderella (Kenneth Branagh, 2015). Smartly, Disney dispatched with the mice and songs of the original and focused more on the characters of the story in this remake. While Cinderella's step-sisters are still very much caricatures, the evil step-mother played by Cate Blanchett is fleshed out more than her animated counter-part. Whether it's the expanded storyline, the removal of the Disney animation tropes like talking animals or catchy tunes, the impressive performance of Blanchett, or the direction of Branagh, Cinderella championed Disney's then new trend of remaking its animated classics in live action.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Regarding some of the criticisms regarding the lack of authentic arab culture portrayed and influences of indian culture (including Naomi Scott). I do not think that is a fair criticism. This movie combines eastern cultures because the original book was written by a french author about a guy in China (possibly middle eastern) and possibly based on the Abbasid empire so the book itself was based on a blend of cultures. So if anything it should have also included Chinese, Turkish and Iranian influences as well. Also I very much prefered the bollywood influence just like WIll Smith (which IMO much more entertaining than anything put out by the egyptian or arab film industry).",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

One of the best movies of 2019 that will endure like others in the Disney catalog,"I have a theory that most of the negative reviews (between 1-4) are xenophobes that subconsciously disliked this movie because of the entire cast that is not of European descent. I saw this movie in the theater, purchased it on blu-ray, and have watched it multiple times.For those who do not appreciate the art of the theatrical music and dance in this film, it is rich in Indian / Middle Eastern influence. This makes complete sense, since Aladdin is based on an old folk tale from the Middle East. Indian dance has an extremely rich history and variety, as rich and older than modern dance, which has roots in court dancing and ballet. There was a nice blend with some hip-hop, and I'm guessing some other world influences (I'm not a dance expert). Disney's live action films have a history of artistic dance, including in films like Mary Poppins and Bedknobs and Broomsticks (the market scene features classical Indian dancing as well).The best song is Jasmine's theme, ""Speechless"", and it honestly made the film, which can be considered a feminist message (another possible reason for the hate). Without creating spoilers, it updates the original animated version in a much needed way, giving Jasmine more of a character, and making her less of a second sidekick to Aladdin (after Abu of course). The animation is seamless, and the cinematography is as good as it gets. Many overhead / zoom in views are beautiful.That being said, this movie is campy and theatrical. If you aren't into musicals, dance numbers, and creative confetti, it might not be your thing. Personally, it was my favorite cheesy flick of 2019. I will watch this many more times to come, whenever I want to hear the music or have a good laugh.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

It is mind blowing 💜💜💜💜,"Within a duration of about 2 hours, I was able to journey through my childhood days, and enjoy each and every bit of the ''Whole new world'' as well. Almost three decades have passed in between the old and new film, yet not a single emotion is absent in the new movie. It is as fresh and soothing as the old one. Hats off to @guyritchie, the director of the movie, for recreating most of my favourite scenes.
Although a debate about @willsmith as the #genie is on air, Smith is too awesome for this role. He has done great justification for the role as well as for the movie. Once again, he proved that he can portray any role in any movie as efficiently as one can think of. @menamassoud as Aladdin is too adorable. He justified the multifaceted character of #Aladdin - a street rat who is forced to earn his living by thieving, a selfless vulnerable guy, a trustworthy friend and a true lover. But what I like mostly about Disney is the paradigm shift of its recent movies; a shift in the trend of female characters from dwelling on a bubble of romanticism to strong women who can earn their own positions in the society by themselves and not by the mercy of the patriarchal society. #Jasmine of this decade can speak about their own demands. They need no help of any man. They know what they want, and how to get them. Jasmine (played by @naomiscott) is perhaps the best role in the movie, and will be remembered by the audience for a long time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
The fresh Prince of Agrabah,"While not as great as the original (though most remakes aren't) This Film doesn't reach the heights of ""The Jungle Book (2016)"" but doesn't stoop to lows of ""Beauty and the Beast (2017)."" What I mean by this is while those films either tried something completely new or attempted to ""Replace the original"" (looking at you Beauty and the Beast) this film knows why it's here and you'll have a fun time watching it. Will Smith and Naomi Scott deliver great performances in there respective roles, with Mena Massoud proving to be a good Aladdin as well, and while the actors are okay, the performances of the Sultan and Jafar are just off due to the specific choices made with the writing and direction. The story is very much the same with a few tweaks here and there. All in all the film is a fun time, albeit nothing groundbreaking, but it's enjoyable for the family and gives you the nostalgia for the original without coming across as a replacement (Cough Beauty and the Beast Cough) the film knows it's a cash grab, but it's worth the money.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
"Boring, no charm whatsoever, careless","I was greatly disappointed by this film. I was expecting beautiful landscapes, incredible renditions, and a phenomenal performance by Will Smith. It has not redeemed itself.Firstly, the introduction to the movie was a lazy effort at a backstory. It always feels false when a movie starts with children asking someone to tell them a story. In all honestly, this was one of the worst examples I've seen of this cliché.Then the editing was way too fast. It felt like someone just randomly cut to whoever was talking, and therefore we never got any reaction shots or other focuses. And all the action shots were cut way too soon; by the time I even realised what was happening in the frame, it had cut away to something else, so it felt very overwhelming to me.I also disliked the new appearance of the Genie. I think he should have stayed black the entire movie, because the blue tone felt so incredibly artificial and therefore I couldn't help but laugh. During all the shots where he is significantly bigger than the other characters, he felt too stretched out and laughably larger.The character of Aladdin also lost all his charm. No longer is he headstrong, confident and endearing, but the acting was so unbelievable he came across as annoying, cocky and merely a copycat of the original. It was also off-putting considering how it's only the main characters that have American accents; either all the characters should have Western Asian accents or all of them should have American - it feels weird otherwise.I also greatly despised 'Speechless'. Not only is it badly written (using the words quiet, silent, and speechless in the chorus alone is just lazy), but it doesn't match the film whatsoever. Gone are the beautiful instruments and Western Asian significance, and along came a pop ballad that most certainly is only in the film to be nominated for an Oscar and to top the charts.In summary, I was majorly disappointed by this movie, and all of Disney's usual talent has wasted away and become lazy, and once again they've just made another monetary, boring copycat.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Entertaining movie!,"This movie was very entertaining and worth seeing. But with that said I had some issues with this movie. Mainly about the CGI on Will Smith's face when he played the genie. The animated version of his face wasn't as fun and lively as I wish it could have been.Another annoyance was how uncharismatic Jafar was, he was forgettable and could easily blend in anywhere without anyone noticing him. Which it's too bad because that character should be very charismatic.There are of course a lot of good things with this movie like the cinematography was very good, colorful and well choreographed, everything Disney is great at. The songs are good even though some are better singers than others. Will Smith was fun to watch and the humor in this movie was on point.I'm a big fan of the original animated Aladdin. I think it's hard to fill Robin Williams shoes as the genie because he was brilliant in that role but Will Smith did a very good job so I have to give that to him.All and all this is a fun and family friendly movie that will give you many laughs.

Not the Train Wreck Everyone Thought it Would Be,"I was beyond skeptical when they announced Guy Ritchie to be the director to helm the live-action version of the beloved 'Aladdin', and I became even more worried after seeing King Arthur: Legend of the Sword. Not that that movie is a trainwreck, but I failed to see how Ritchie could inject his style into a kids movie. The answer being that he doesn't, he stays true to what made the original Aladdin a phenomena and adjusts certain plot elements that needed to be adjusted. For instance, Jafar doesn't need to be old man pining over a young Princess Jasmine. And you can't really copy what Robin Williams did as Genie, so you take Will Smith and breathe his charisma and charm into a new Genie, which feels even more modern than what Williams did. Not better, but still very good. The movie had an uphill climb to make from the moment it was announced, but I think it did about as well as it could have. Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott are stars in the making (while admittedly it took me a few scenes to warm up to these characters), who did wonders with the roles of Aladdin & Jasmine respectively. It's worth it for 'A Whole New World' alone.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
"Against All Odds, Will Smith Makes The Genie His Pwn","I just got out of watching Aladdin (2019)I'll get the negative out of the way first. Jasmine's new song 'Speechless' is awful, (and its sung twice) and is more of Hollywood shoving this message down our throats!! The song (about a princess suffering from make oppression) is not empowering for women at all. I have no problem with strong empowering women characters in movies, but as a whole, Hollywood (especially lately) sucks at giving us them!! If they want to empower generations of women, they need to write them so much better than they are. Give us an Arya Stark or Brieanne Of Tarth from Game Of Thrones, Princess Leia or a Sarah Connor from T2, not this!! Naomi Scott is not to blame here, her performance was fine. Likewise, Marwan Kenzari. He has taken a lot of flack and I sort of get it. I didn't hate him, he tries his best with what he is given, but he is just miscast. Mena Massoud tries a little bit too hard at times too. I thought at times he was trying to copy the animated versions too much with his facial expressions.On to the goodWill Smith totally makes the genie his own. I was really worried he wouldn't pull it off, but he does. I loved his version of 'Friend Like Me' and I have to say, the clip they have been using of the Prince Ali song (which I did not like) on talk shows does not do it justice at all!! It looked great on the big screen. Outside of Smith and Scott's performance, the only other one to stand out for me was Nasim Pedrad as Dalia, Princess Jasmine's hand maiden. She stole a few scene's for me.It's big on spectacle and looked great at times, even if watching parkour (even if the character doing it is singing) bores me as much as over long car chases.Overall I'd say a 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Give it a chance,"I loved this movie. To be honest, the original Aladdin was not one of my favorite animated Disney films. Obviously I loved Robin Williams as the genie and I still listen to some of the soundtrack, but the movie as a whole was just never one of my favorites.
That being said, this is one of my favorite live action remakes Disney has done. While they stuck pretty well to the original story, they didn't copy it. Will Smith didn't even try to recreate Robin Williams' genie, he made it his own. That was the only way it would ever work, and it did. They switched up the soundtrack a little and made it more modern, which typically I would hate but I actually enjoyed it here.
From reading other reviews, it sounds like the people who have written negative reviews went into the movie expecting it to be a total recreation of the original. To me, when making these live action remakes, you want to make it original in its own way. So, if you go into this movie wanting it to be the exact same as the original animated version, you won't like it. But, if you give it a chance as its own movie while looking for a little nostalgia to go with it, it's very enjoyable.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

A joyous film - Disney in fine form!,"I've actually never seen the original animated version of Aladdin, so this was my first time experiencing the story, and I loved it! It's so full of Disney magic, is a quintessential Disney story, and ticks all the boxes for me.For those unfamiliar with the story I won't go into any detail so as not to spoil. but it's really fun, with lots of adventure and humour. It's paced really well, has lots of great characters, and had a pretty tight script.The best bit about this film for me were the three central performances from Mena Massoud, Naomi Scott, and Will Smith. They were all exceptional and made their characters so likeable and enjoyable to watch. I particularly liked Smith as the genie, and thought he brought his unique charm and personality to the role, playing it to perfection.The songs are all fantastic, and were performed superbly. There were some pretty great dance sequences too.What I'm finding with all of these Disney live action remakes is the production value of these films. They've really invested in these and it shows. Aladdin benefited from fantastic cinematography and a vibrant colour palette, which really made this film a feast for the eyes.There's not much more to say here!

"Decent homage to the original, and it's own unique film","Not just a live-action remake, but Ritchie injects enough to make it good enough to stand on its own. Don't get me wrong, the original Disney animated classic is by far one of the best to come out of the studio, among the favorites from the golden age of Disney animation, before they started going downhill. This was done well enough that a direct comparison isn't fair. To hold it as it's own film is a much more honest way of looking at it.Ritchie departs from his usual style and substance, and this isn't a bad thing. While Will Smith is certainly no Robin Williams, he does bring a certain flair and hip hop style to the role to really make it good own. As for the rest of the cast, they all deliver and it's nice to see a certain respect to the cultural geography of the story by having Middle Eastern/North African/Central Asian cast. Navid Negahban as the Sultan, I feel was far underused as good of an actor as he is. Mena Massoud did quite good as the titular title character. Marwan Kenzari is menacing enough as Jafar, with a very different feel for Iago with Alan Tudyk providing a much less fantastical portrayal of the animal villain sidekick, which to say he always delivers and is one of my favorite atypical actors. Naomi Scott really wows with her singing, dancing, and acting, and I feel like delivered the very best out of the entire cast. Yes, even considering the huge personality that is the Fresh Prince in the same room.The music is also well done, while utilizing many of the songs from the original, the actors do well to provide their own talents to make the songs really feel like the touring counterparts to famous Broadway performances. That's what most of this film feels like, a performance of a hit musical, just not with the original cast. Not necessarily bad, good, in fact, just not as good as the original. The choreography is also very well done, with a touch of Bollywood feel thrown in the mix.The direction was good, the CGI, while heavy at times, was still decent enough to feel immersive and able to entertain. One often wonders when considering how they'll adapt certain scenes from an animated tale to live-action, and here they did well enough. Not great, but well enough to not make me shudder, namely the Jafar/Snake.Is this as impactful and iconic as the original (coming from the era of Disney animation that brought us The Little Mermaid, The Lion King, and Beauty and the Beast)? No. But on its own merits it does well to stand out as one of the better live-action adaptations of a classic animated IP (I also enjoyed the live-action Beauty and the Beast).",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
A Wil Smith Movie That Propels It,"With musical elements oddly reminiscent of the most recent and compelling James Bond's melodies along with the television hyped musical series such as Glee, Aladdin presents a sort of glorified musical version of those 50s movies attempts at ethnic diversity, but with mixed results. There are several points in the movie where the editing and transition between a some of the later scenes seem rough and uneven. Wil Smith as the genie along with his accompanying dazzling special effects really maintains the energy for this movie and offers up his own Robin Williams antics that has Smith's imprint solidly established in his own right. Jasmin's strong woman's character is undeniable and the musical and singing performances are decent from the original animated version, if not all memorable as could be said of the contemporaneous and memorable music from movie Rocketman (2019), the biopic of Elton John.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

However, Will Smith as the Genie was quite brilliant and provided nearly all of this movies highlights. Without the Genie this movie would probably score about a 3/10 but Will Smith's performance was so charasmatic and funny that he really rescued this movie from failure. Also, i didn't see the point in Jasmine's 2 songs that weren't part of the orginal.

I get where the director wanted to go, but I believe the ending scene could have more action... hint (Jasmine just froze) Thats how much danger she was in.....I like really! come on. It kinda felt more a Jasmine film in the end instead of an Aladdin film. (When you see it you know what I mean). I will say thought there could have been more passionate kisses in the movie lol.OVERALL - Aladdin and the music team did great! Overall a great hard earn movie ------ the ending could have been a lot better !!!!!WHEN YOU GO SEE IT - Funny - Check. Good Story - Check. Romance - Could have been better. More action at the end with more Aladdin rescue. Music - CHECK !!! MUSIC WAS GREAT!!!",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Can't understand why?.......,"Why oh why did they cast everyone that is wrong for their roles. Will Smith as Genie is so far from the mark is in fact painful to watch. What Disney did is pay cast Will Smith to be - well Will Smith. It was never going to be easy to follow in the footsteps of the late/great Robin Williams, but Smith just wasn't the right actor. The character demands a loose cannon actor who'd insert energy by going off script. The likes of Jim Carey comes to mind, Eddie Murphy, Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Seth Rogan to name but a few would've suited better. I simply think this film wasn't well cast against the story we know and love. I had high hopes in this but it simply crashed and burned for me. Money will be made, but alas it's got the feel of huge CGI level of cash has been thrown at it and they hope success will stick. It's not a classic but is a simple classic retell. You'll watch it once type film, not one you'd put on again and again. On rerun maybe, to keep the kids content on a Sunday afternoon but I'll have to pass by first frozen/Tangled/CoCo/Beauty and the Beast/lion king etc, once this lands again on cable/sky. Sorry Will, don't hate me for the truth, just remember Sharks Tail my friend, you had to make a wage but dam son, this was a 'no!' all day of the week!.

"A Carpet Ride Into A Rushed, Familiar, World","Disney cartoons in the 90s were the stuff of magic, and the foundation of my love for their movies. The animated adventures and their accompanying soundtracks were able to permanently embed themselves in my mind, heart and soul defining what Walt's imagination established years ago. Then came the live action versions and things started getting mixed up in the modern day of representation, realism, and trying to spin these tales in a way of being new/yet familiar. There have been plenty of ups and downs, but they have found their place and tonight they try another milestone with big shoes, or in this case sandals/moccasins to fill. Can it work?

SUMMARY:
Let's put it out there, Aladdin cartoons have set much up for quality in many ways, and yours truly is a big fan of it. Yet this spin on it managed in a way to accomplish the goal of appeasing many audience members. Guy Ritchie's take on it holds the core story with the nostalgia nicely baked in making sure to hit the highlights of each moment with a new visual style. The reimagined world holds nice visual effects and some beautiful attention to detail in the infusion of cultures bringing the beloved cartoon to life and making it semi realistic. Yet, when some people recreated these wonders, the magic of the film is lost to the darker tale and grittier atmosphere, sort of draining the enchantments the cartoon films held. Fortunately, Ritchie and his crew succeeded in keeping the funny and cute moments in tact primarily in the form of clever one liners, Will Smith's take on the genie, and relationship of Abu and Carpet, the former of which you want to adopt. Yet the film also succeeds in bringing those relationships we love to life and somehow putting some new charms to it, to help them stand out. Mena Massoud has the charm, naivety and wonder that Aladdin held to be the adventurous lad. Naomi Scott's voice and strong attitude pave a new Jasmine that will speak to the modern female audience, yet also enchant others. As for Will Smith, he makes the Genie his own character familiar yet also different to not attempt to copy the late William's work. His take was fun, almost like Fresh Prince of Bel-Air meeting Disney and it worked beautifully for me, primarily in the chemistry between him and Massoud (very touching at times). And as for the music, while not quite the same as the 90's songs in terms of energy, some of the tracks have their new spin work out well that is a blend of old and new and having charisma, my favorite being a Whole New World and Friend Like Me. New Songs by Jasmine though might be my favorite though, a new addition that fits well, delivers the messages, and showcases the Scott's wonderful voice.
Yet for all the good there are some things still lacking for me. First the world that they made was not explored enough like the original version, reduced to feeling like a close set instead of the epic kingdom of Agrabah and the Arabian desert. In fact, the movie feels very rushed at times, with the opening ran very quickly, that in no time we are at the cave of wonders instead of the buildup I was expecting. This pace sort of robs the charm of the world and characters, sometimes getting lost in the all the new political moves and new gimmicks in place of the story telling. For me this was especially true for the take on Jafar. In terms of looks, it get realism, and ambitions it is there, but this Jafar did not quite have the devious nature of the traditional villain. That suave, sophisticated and cunning air, was lost to grandiosity and whining rather than that meticulous planning of the wise wizard. And when it came time to fight him, well the anticlimactic moments were lost again to new themes and takes, including the design of his genie form. Much of these limitations came from shoving the political components into the mix that were both endearing and then forced/beaten over the head. The Dream Big Princess movement is alive and while respectable did not feel like it should have been as large a focus. As for the other songs, many of the tracks did not have the same flow, energy, and agreement with the scene like the movie, the new take changing the pace and energy of the scene that did not fit as well with the scene.
Overall, Aladdin's live remake is one of the better ones for me because it tried to accomplish blending nostalgia and yet being different to not compete with the classics. I had fun with this film, loved the relationships and acting between groups, the dynamics with CGI and some of those songs that took me to a whole new world. Yet, the movie just did not explore the Agrabah as much as I wanted, rushing through various moments to not be quite as complete or suspenseful of an adventures that the 90s version held. It's that lack of scenes, songs, and acting all working together that is probably the biggest miss for me, and while not awful, was not to the full extent it could have been. Still, the film is worth a visit and appropriate for most little ones given much of the fear inducing scenes have been removed. Overall my scores are:Adventure/Comedy/Family: 7
Movie Overall 7.0",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
I loved it despite the naysayers,"From the beginning I was enchanted by the costumes, the cinematography, the presentation, the songs, the wonder of CGI. I loved it more than the animated version and was totally involved in the story. A couple scenes were a bit dragish for a few minutes but overall....IT ROCKED. Will Smith was AWESOME as the genie and Naomi Scott nailed the princess. Mena Massoud was fun and made it fun...I hate that some think everyone should be over authentic to whatever they believe but it's a MOVIE and is about imagination and fun. The world is a mix of all and all of us come from various beginnings but we are all human, connected and I love the characters, the actors, all of it.

Surprisingly good!,"I think too many people have a downer on Disney and nothing they do will ever be good enough.
This type of film is one which I will watch with my family under duress and sometimes I'm pleasantly surprised. This was one of those times. I thought it was generally well made, the singing was good, although not Will Smiths strong point (stick to rap, Will), but the film was funny.
I enjoyed it, and as my wife said, only Disney could give a carpet the character that makes you engage with it.

"Guy Ritchie, Please Stop","I have never liked Guy Ritchie movies. Whilst I will say he does have a certain style that is recognisable in his earlier gangster flicks, his recent directorial efforts have been awash with horrible editing, painful dialogue, and surprisingly a lack of a fitting style. Aladdin is another live action remake of a Disney classic, and its only positives are two solid performances from Will Smith and Naomi Scott, and some predictably strong CGI.However, the rest of the film sucks. I hated Aladdin so much it may even be my most hated film of 2019. Mena Massoud is just a pretty boy with the acting range of a TV remote. The actor who played the villain is terrible, he isn't menacing, he's more campy and pathetic. The dance and song numbers are just flat, there is zero creativity except for the costume department. The camera work is basic, there is zero attempt to add flair and pace and fun into these dance numbers, hell even The Greatest Showman had flair and style.Guy Ritchie is lazy. He injects nothing into the film in terms of style or making the film standout from others like it. It's just paint by the numbers, let's get from A to B filmmaking.There is no tension, the comedy is so painful at one point I felt I had an aneurysm, and I blame that on the scene involving a hugely elongated joke about jam jars. The stars have no chemistry, the romance feels fake, and what hit me the most about this film, and just like the majority of these live action remakes, is that I'm always aware about how artificial these movies are. I'm aware everything is green screen, I'm aware that there is nothing remotely real or believable in these flicks. A movie should immerse you and make you forget about what went into it, only after should you admire how technically accomplished a film may be, but these Disney remakes are artificial and without a heart. God I'm dreading The Lion King now...",1.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Possibly a superior remake,"I'm 36 years old and Aladdin was my favourite Disney film growing up, along with a lot of people I would guess. Disney have been piling these remakes out over the last few years with varying degrees of success. Beauty and the Beast was okay, The Jungle Book and The Lion King did financially well and Dumbo was welcomed with lukewarm reviews. So Aladdin was one I worried about. Mixed in with all these other remakes, would it fade into the background, can Will Smith do justice to the Genie role, and why on earth had they hired Guy Ritchie to direct? Well fear not, because for me, this is the best live action Disney remake to date. It has the charm of the original, the story is tweaked to be more relevant with today's audience, and Will Smith is amazing as the Genie. Guy Ritchie's best film since Snatch. Maybe we've found a genre he can tackle outside of British gangster.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
A good live action remake of a Disney classic,"These live action remakes of Disney classics have been a mixed bag as far as I'm concerned, with some being good (Beauty and the Beast) and some being poor (The Jungle Book). I am happy to say though that Aladdin is served well in its new form.Yes, like all these remakes they drag the running time out longer than it should be, but there's a lot to like here, and some faithful recreations of the moments that fans will hold dear.Will Smith is of course the big name cast members, replacing Robin Williams as the Genie, and brings his own unique comedic sensibility to the role.

"I appreciated the effort, but it didn't work","I walked into Aladdin knowing that nothing could top the original. That being said, I was hoping that it would be decent, and it really wasn't, and that made me sad because I'm a huge fan of Guy Ritchie films. I'm just gonna list all of the pros and cons of the film.PROS: The cast and costuming was great, the Genie had a lot of enthusiasm in his performance, Aladdin and Jasmine had great voices, and I especially loved the darker side of Jafar.CONS: Some of the musical numbers were very lackluster. The numbers such as ""One Jump Ahead"", ""Friend Like Me"", ""Prince Ali"", and ""A Whole New World"" were supposed to have a sense of energy and excitement, but I was bored throughout them all. I didn't like how they remixed ""A Whole New World"" to be this generic pop ballad. I also felt that the addition of the song ""Speechless"" was totally unnecessary. The Genie could've been better cast, but I like how he didn't try too hard to copy Robin Williams. I said before that I liked Jafar's darker nature, but he could've been even darker and more menacing had he been better cast. Some of the camera work was lame and there was nothing special about it. I also didn't sense any chemistry between Aladdin and Jasmine. Also, I wish I could've seen more of Guy Ritchie's distinctive style of filmmaking instead of a generic blockbuster because I really like his films. I was also missing some of the elements from the original such as a smartmouth Iago, Jasmine being trapped in the hourglass, and shapeshifting Jafar just to cap it all off.That all being said, I wish I could've enjoyed it more. I personally think that Guy Ritchie should stay away from the blockbuster genre (unless it's a Sherlock Holmes movie), and he should stick to independent films such as ""Snatch"" and ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"". In conclusion, I didn't like Aladdin, and I wish I could've enjoyed it more.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

"A pretty fun, but uneventful ride down memory lane.","So I saw the new Aladdin at the theater. Honestly my expectations were very high. Aladdin is my favorite Disney movie of all time. While I knew it couldn't live up to the animated classic, all I wanted was a fun ride out of the film. Overall it was a pretty average mixed bag of an experience.I assume everyone knows the plot of Aladdin at this point. Largely the film remains untouched regarding the major plot points. Of course the film has altered a few small things and added around 30 minutes of content to the original script. Unfortunately I can't say those 30 minutes really added anything at all but length to the movie. There is a surprise fanservice story arc involving Jasmine that many will enjoy however.The animation and production design of the movie were outstanding. In every way the film and its setting were gorgeous. The movie was bright and vibrant and sure to please children of all ages. The setting and costume design were also very well done and presented a diverse and fun look into a live-action Agrabah City and its inhabitants. The movie was pure eye candy from start to finish.The musical elements of the film were mostly very well done. It's hard not to compare the song to their original counterparts, but the music was just as catchy as ever. I will say the original songs designed for the movie on the other hand were just very bland. There wasn't a single memorable new song in the film. That is a shame considering how many earworms the original Aladdin had.Performance-wise I honestly have to say Will Smith stole the show. I was very hesitant initially about his casting. Robin Williams performance was just so memorable. Will Smith pays respect to Robin Williams performance, but definitely makes this his own interpretation of the genie. Most of the other performances were very okay. Nothing terrible, but no other performance really stood out. I will say Marwan Kenzari's interpretation of Jafar was just bad. It lacked any bit of menace and intrigue and just came across as whiny. It is also criminal to not have Gilbert Godfrey play the part of Iago.Overall the biggest weakness of the film was finding a reason for it to exist. Sure it had its fun moments, but the best aspects of the film were direct copies of the cartoon. Why bother makeing a live action version if it's going to be a near shot-for-shot remake with extra unnecessary padding? I will add the 30 minutes of padding did nothing but slow down the film and add plot points just for fan service. The film was just far too long for the writing to carry. There is some also very cringe-worthy dialogue and humor throughout the movie. Of course kids will love those moments, but for a film based upon my childhood classic I expected more.Aladdin was not a terrible movie. It wasn't a disaster like Dumbo. It was however a wasted opportunity. It just feels so bland and devoid of the classic Disney Magic. Sure the film had a few strengths, but there's nothing about this film that makes me want to re-watch it over and over again. The original content was bloated and slowed the film down, plus the new music was a bore. It held my entertainment and my two-year-old loved it, but it did not wow me at all. It did however make me want to watch the original Aladdin. A 6.75 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Poor Remake,"I walked out of the cinema as soon as Blue Will Smith came out of the lamp... he was horrible lifeless and not funny..If ur curious about the film don't be, it's poor and the original still does it for me and I'm at the age to appreciate it from the day of release.",1.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Will Smith Saves an Otherwise Dull Reimagining of a Classic,"Firstly, neither Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, or Mulan should be remade. None of them are even over 30 years old and are still fresh in the majority of the movie going public's eye, and are constantly re-released on home video with brand new special editions and are almost always played on television. It was a bit different with your Alice in Wonderland, Maleficent, Cinderella, and Jungle Book because they were much older and not as fresh in the eyes of the mainstream so a reimagining of any of those seemed expected to happen sooner than later. With Aladdin one is left with a raised eye brow pondering its need to exist because what could you really do to expand upon or redo what was already done well to fine in the 1992 original animation? Having seen it these questions still persist as there is really nothing on display that improves upon the content of the original or does it do anything creatively new and exciting that would make one want to revisit it as opposed to its original. The characters lack the charm of their original counterparts, the scope feels fairly condensed to where obvious sets are obvious and the bulk of the action is kept in mostly one spot because of obvious budgetary reasons(odd given how much was invested into its production), the musical numbers do not feel organic to the story and often come across as very forced in, and the cinematography comes across so amateurish you're left to wonder where all the money was spent.I suppose after The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and King Arthur Guy Ritchie really just needed a hit and decided to play it very safe, unfortunately he enters territories he is not well versed in such as directing orchestrated musical and dance. There are only one or two spots in the movie which feel truly like Guy Ritchie was behind the camera, but everywhere else feels like it could've been easily been someone whose biggest credit in their career was random filler episode of any season of television for The CW or Freeform. The inclusion of political mumbo jumbo to be more 'relevant' with today's cinemagoers are but more forced additions into the narrative that will date it sooner than later and cause many to eye roll in the theater.The best aspect of this production is Will Smith as the Genie, he steals the show completely in every scene he is in and is doing his best to make the musical lyrics pop and energize the atmosphere. It was going to be pretty hard to step into the late great Robin Williams' shoes but Will Smith did a fine job with his take on the iconic character.See it if you must, but otherwise stick to the original - its not going anywhere.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Only for Jasmine and Genie !,"I did not see animated version of Aladdin, then I am not comparing with it. Most of viewers compared. But as me there should be not comparison between two versions of same movie or story even after a long period gap, because each has its flavour and standard with their timelines.. So Aladdin should be judged as standalone.
Firstly to mention that the role of Jasmine, as it is major attraction of the movie. Naomi Scott is perfect for this role; she looks graceful and gorgeous with her stunning outfits. Her presence will give you relief from get boring from such old times Arabian tales which are mostly from magical background. I do not hesitate to say that Jasmine gave me full value of my money and time and actually went to multiplex only for her. Second mentionable thing is Will Smith. He comically played the role of Jin. Rest are okay. The tiger, the monkey, the bird etc for kids. Only flying carpet comes for you to ride enjoyable moments. Musical story telling is a new idea, but it seems a bit boring for me. My suggestion is that if you want to see glorious & charming princess and a comical Jin then watch Aladdin otherwise leave it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Aladdin or The Will Smith Show?,"My Review- Aladdin I rate 6.5I really am a sucker for classic Disney films but I think this one like Beauty and the Beast and Dumbo to my mind miss the boat ,possibly because humanising animation classics or trying to bring them up to date adds nothing to the original.It's a good cast Mena Massoud as Aladdin is engaging as the rascally Aladdin ,Naomi Scott is charming and feisty as Princess Jasmine and has a lovely voice .
Will Smith is very talented but at times the whole movie just seems to be the Will Smith show. Will is cast as The Genie and Mariner and just doesn't have the humour and brilliance of Robin Williams or his voice in the original animated classic.Aladdin has already been humanised in the Broadway musical brilliantly but this is not a film of the musical,perhaps a pity they didn't make it one.There are only 4 original songs from the musical and one good new song for Naomi Scott to belt out ""Speechless "" an anthem to transform Princess Jasmine into a modern woman of today ready to take on any man who tries to takes her power away ,which is a good role model for children watching the movie but alas I think they'd be bored by the time it arrives.There are some very good scenes in Aladdin , like Aladdin's entrance into Agrabah,it's the best entrance into a city since Elizabeth Taylor as Cleopatra entered Rome and if it's the first time you've seen Aladdin there's lots to like but I hope this is the last version and I also hope and think the new humanised Lion King will be better.I imagine when Studio executives sit around discussing these hopefully multi million dollar blockbuster remakes that the main requirements discussed are ,let's pour the cash in to get an A list Star and Director plus the latest CGI which I'm beginning to think stands for Costly Graphic Indigestion.What ever happened to let's do something new and original

No classic but a lot of fun,"First some context.My expectations for Aladdin were about as low as they come.So-so trailers, seemingly zero positive pre-release hype and a director whose sadly been out of form for time, the stars really did not seem to be aligning for Disney's latest live action treatment of a beloved property.It's great to report then that against all the odds, Guy Ritchie's colourful, often energetic and sometimes brilliantly fun re-imagining of the classic Aladdin tale is more than watchable, certainly not great and not anywhere near as memorable as the classic Disney animation, but absolutely entertaining enough to justify a trip to the cinema.Made for the whole family in mind, Ritchie's take on the age old tale sticks relatively close to the formula of the past with a few new additions (including an extra song for Princess Jasmine and some extended last act amendments) and while Ritchie's renowned visual flourishes and slick camera movements remain sadly mostly restrained, the renowned British filmmaker handles his first musical and family adventure with a typical confidence that ensures the buzzing sets, large-scale set-pieces and musical numbers will bring a smile to even the most hard to please of faces.Another reason this new Aladdin remains surprisingly watchable is due to the casting of these beloved characters with newcomers Mena Massoud as street dweller turned prince Aladdin and Naomi Scott as Jasmine both doing fine work, even if Scott is the real MVP of the musical numbers over her co-star.Both young performers share an easy going chemistry and charisma making their time on screen enjoyable, overshadowed however by the much-maligned Will Smith who silences the doubters with a great incarnation of our much loved blue Genie.Derided thanks to some mediocre pre-release marketing, Smith is as fun as his been in years as the character made famous by the late Robin Williams with the now 50 year old star giving it his all. While not excelling in the singing department, Smith makes the Genie his own as he takes over the film around the half-way mark and his presence in the film goes a long way to making Ritchie's adventure yarn a simple to enjoy proposition.While perfectly fun, its undeniable that Aladdin never truly soars and starts to peter out in the somewhat bloated second act that starts to lose the energetic vibe of the first half and the less said about lead villain Jafar (played rather poorly by Marwan Kenzari) the better, with it becoming rather disappointing such a bland and boring big bad was employed in the film when there was the chance for the scheming character to really chew up the scenery had it been done right.Final Say -Far from a classic new take on a beloved tale, Guy Ritchie's Aladdin is still a visual big screen delight that is a lot better than many had thought it possible to be, bought to life by some fun turns from its up and coming leads and an extremely fun Will Smith performance.3 jars of jam out of 5",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

"Not as bad as many reviewers say, but not as good as it should be","I can't believe the number of low scoring reviews for this film. It had the feel of a big budget film, had great camerawork, had extravagant costumes and colours and Will Smith as the genie. The roles of Aladdin and Jasmine were good too and the songs, whilst not as great as the animated film, were pretty solid. It's not a classic, ( there again neither was the remake of Beauty & The Beast), but it delivers a very good film for all audiences.
I do agree with the reviewers that the character of Jafar wasn't as pantomime-evil as he should have been. He was a bit underwhelming but it didn't detract extensively from enjoying this film. The studios must have been relatively happy with Guy Ritchie's direction, as it's made over $1bn dollars worldwide already on a $183m budget.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
"A messy and underwhelming live-action adaptation, with uninspiring results","As much as Disney continues to turn every animated film within their animated vault into live-action, the live-action adaptation of Aladdin is turned into an underwhelming, uninspired and jumbled mess, with only a few redeemable qualities.In terms of direction, Guy Ritchie is proven to be ill-suited to direct a musical like Aladdin, given the fact of how he handled the direction of the musical sequences turns completely bland, and the results of its action sequences were choppily-cut and sloppy, which results on his direction as extremely rote and soulless. Another issue with this remake, is that the script is completely messy and it's all over the place, with full of cringeworthy dialogue, humour and off-putting jokes, with none of it stick the landing. Furthermore, the prevalence of ham-fisted exposition also results to the loss of naturalism and dramatic pause, and it weakens characterizations. Making no favors either, is that the brutally slowed pacing, which makes the viewing experience of this remake to feel like a complete slog. Another problem that this remake truly suffers, is with the cheap-looking quality of the costumes and sets, along with the inconsistent CGI (particularly the CGI quality of Will Smith's Genie, which almost looks unwatchable), making the remake completely dull and garish. The worst quality of this movie, comes with a cheap and bad cinematography that features like a TV instead of cinema, as well as the jarring and incoherent editing, which really weaken the film's quality even further.And lastly, comes with the terrible performance of Marwan Kenzari as Jafar, who's completely miscast for the villainous role of Jafar. While film attempts to make Jafar a more suave, handsome and even charming character - compared to being both a literal and figurative cartoon in the animated film, Kenzari's lack of screen presence and wooden delivery fails to do justice to the iconic Disney villain. Furthermore, the part desperately needed an actor with actual bass in their voice, not to mention a prevailing charisma, both of which Kenzari simply lacks. Making no good favors, comes with the underwhelming voice work of Alan Tudyk as Iago, whom simply wasted and falls short to the superior voice work of Gilbert Gottfried as Iago.Still, the Aladdin is still salvaged with some redeemable qualities that saved this remake from being a complete trainwreck. Among the cast that stood out as the best, was Will Smith in his interpretation of the Genie of which he easily serves as the most entertaining aspect of the entire movie and nearly stealing the whole show. At the same time, his performance gave him the most Will Smith performance that he has ever given. Also, Will Smith also have a good sense of not to try and imitate or out-do the iconic performance of Robin Williams's Genie, by placing Will Smith's own style and flavor in his version of the Genie, which is completely impressive. Also, the major standouts with the movie were Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott as Aladdin and Jasmine, who gave out their fleshed out and natural chemistry to win out above the cheesy nature of the film, as well as charismatic performances. Other members of the cast that nearly stole the show were Nasim Pedrad as Dalia, and Billy Magnussen as Prince Anders, despite of the two being underutilized, had the most effective comedic work and timing.All in all, the Aladdin remake still serves as an inferior and weak counterpart to the more superior 1992 animated original. Nevertheless, in spite of the film's flaws and problems, the Aladdin remake can simply be treated as a guilty pleasure.",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

a wondrous crowd-pleaser that merits its Disneyland provenance,"Disney's live action rehash of its vast animation cannon unabashedly trades on its multiplex time-honored stories as good scripts are few and far between nowadays, it is a canny strategy and has paid great dividends as yet, ALADDIN, its 1992 cel animation feature is an echt corker, boasting a kaleidoscopic Middle-Eastern folktale of substantive visual sumptuosity, not to mention Robin Williams' transcendent voice work as Genie, which, as this reviewer sees it, among one of the most versatile voice-only performances ever.Here, Will Smith exultantly assumes Williams' mantle in this live action, bulks ups and sheathed in all-blue warpaint, he brings down the house when actualizing Genie's multifaceted omnipotence and physical transformation at the drop of a hat, but isn't a patch on Williams for his elocution, Smith's uttering rhythm is conspicuously contemporary and self-conscious (the singing part doesn't do him much good, the reworked FRIEND LIKE ME hardly leaves an impact), shy of a freewheeling drollness that makes William's Genie such a deathless godsend.Directed by Guy Ritchie, literally the last name director one can expect to be tapped into making a family-friendly Disney fare, ALADDIN more or less, hews to the original story, but retrofits a female-empowering upgrade relative to princess Jasmine (a revelatory Naomi Scott), who thumbs her nose at a doofus white-skin suitor (Billy Magnussen, mired in stereotypes and desperately wanting of a breakthrough), belts out the theme song SPEECHLESS with flying colors, and whose glass-ceiling breaking resolve of being a sultan of the desert kingdom Agrabah pays off satisfactorily.By comparison, Mena Massoud's street-smart, diamond-in-the-rough Aladdin has less powerful vocal register (bespoken by their duet of A WHOLE NEW WORLD), but compensates it with rollicking, puppetry-mimicking dancing routines, and whose disarming geniality will eventually grow on the viewers. In the antagonist post, Marwan Kenzari's vile vizier Jafar is cartoonish, but telegraphing a faintly epicene charisma that may pave the way for Disney's more radical act of creating characters of heterodox diversity (a timely move too), meanwhile, pet monkey Abu, parrot Iago (voiced by Alan Tudyk) and the magic carpet, all being convincingly and anthropomorphically reified by the state-of-the-art computer-generated FX undertaking and have their own moments to shine.Totally clicking the box of ethnicity-correctness, buffeting audience with its eye-pleasing 3D spectacles and sleek action bravura, Guy Ritchie's ALADDIN is at any rate, a wondrous crowd-pleaser that merits its Disneyland provenance, however, in terms of rejiggering its original template with a more topical, bolder spin, like its predecessors, Kenneth Branagh's CINDERELLA (2015) and Bill Condon's BEAUTY AND BEAST (2017), it tends to rest on its laurels and is stymied by the fear that any change might affront or displease its core audience, between having the cake and eating it, clearly Disney has made a conservative choice, at this point, not even the upcoming THE LION KING (2019) can alter that, unfortunately.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

"Very good, just some things....","The movie visually is spectacular, the city, the costumes and effects are very weel done. Love the characters of Aladdin, Jasmine, Abu and the Genius, very good work from the actors. The Sultan has a lesser role, but nothing to complain.The original songs were done excellently, I love to see that Arabian Nights was made longer, i love that song. The other ones, one can argue if the animated version is better or not, but I can believe that at least both are at the same level. The new Jasmine song ""speechless"", although being a good song, Naomi's voice is also very good, but I just didn't feel the arab style in it, it just have a generic pop style, what I love about Aladdin is that middle east style.But maybe the biggest problem is Jafar, is not the actuation of Kenzari, he does a very good job on his part, but I also believe it was a total miscast, he doesn't look menacing, imposing, his voice is too soft, and is not strong enought for you to feel that Aladdin and Jasmine are in real danger, not even in the third act. This character needed to be a bigger menace to the heroes.

This film in itself is relatively normal.

Extra stuff bogs down a decent adaptation,"Do we need this movie? Well, we don't need any movies, so the answer is no. However, the movie being what it is, it's far from the worst time at the cinema.So, you know the early 90s animated movie, so you know the story of the live-action remake. Most of the film is beat for beat the same story. There are some small changes (one of which I quite liked, but the rest felt either extraneous or simply unimportant), but yeah, it's exactly the same.The movie's opening is surprisingly quick and a bit out of order, though. It zooms through the animated movie's first 20 minutes in about 10, leaving out a proper introduction for Jasmine and throwing her right into her moment disguised as a peasant in the market. We know who she is because we've seen the previous version, but the movie acts like we shouldn't know its Jasmine. It's an odd situation to the point where she calls herself Dahlia, the princess's handmaiden, one wonders if that's just for Aladdin or for the audience as well.Then we get to what is probably the best part of the whole remake affair, Jafar. His introduction and first few motions are far superior here than then were in the original. In the original, Jafar was bad man who did some unexplained magic with a large diamond to find the diamond in the rough. In the remake, he is throwing peasant after peasant into the Cave of Wonders before he watches Aladdin make fools of the palace guards in order to reach Jasmine. He decides, actively, that Aladdin must be the diamond in the rough. His guards end up capturing the street rat, and instead of tricking him as an old man, he reveals himself fully, takes Aladdin to the Cave under guard, and actually makes a small connection. Jafar started from nothing, much as Aladdin is then. Jafar can rise up, and so can Aladdin. Pretty much everything after that is the same with Jafar, but that introduction and how Jafar gets things moving is the one actual improvement.Will Smith is good as the genie, but he can't escape the shadow of Robin Williams, which is unfair. Smith is in a different movie, and we should judge him based purely on that context. In that context, he's pretty good. It's whenever they mimic Williams too closely (like the 3 rules of wishing scene) that it ends up feeling false. Smith doesn't have the same personality to make a series of off the cuff impressions, and whenever it does happen, it feels wrong.The music is largely the same (surprise!). A few lyric changes here and there to make lyrics from a kid's more more...er...kid friendly. The ""Friend Like Me"" number is a strong combination of visual effects and (probably CGI enhanced) dancing set to a tune everyone already knows they love. The ""Prince Ali"" song as Aladdin comes into Agrabah feels smaller and more confined than the animated version, but it's still colorful and energetic. Jasmine has a new number which feels out of step both stylistically and narratively (the movie stops dead so she can sing it). The actress sings it with passion, but the song ""Speechless"" ends up feeling a bit pointless and out of place.Overall, on its own, the movie is okay. It's not quite good because of its opening, which is confusing and rushed, and the fact that it embraces complexity where it's not necessary (there's a lot of talk about invading a neighboring country that is oddly extraneous). I was actually along with it for a while, but the movie kind of got bogged down in its final act that ended up dragging the rest of the movie down with it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Besides being stunning eye candy the movie has an interesting story to offer with great characters that develop graduadly throughout the movie.

Less entertaining, less magical, just less. And the addition of the third act chase scene is indicative of the formulaic pushing of all cookie cutter movies Disney pushes.

Surprisingly excellent fun,"Aladdin, a street urchin, uses a magic oil lamp to unleash a powerful larger than life genie to makes his dreams come true and fall I love with the beautiful daughter of the sultan of Agrabah.A surprisingly colourful fantastic adaptation by John August and director Guy Ritchie. Excellent effects, staging and songs etc the whole production is magical, exceeding expectations.All the cast are on form, the casting is exceptional. Will Smith gives an enjoyable energetic and restrained performance as the Genie. The trailer didn't do him justice. With a great singing voice and screen presence Mena Massoud takes all the best cues from his cartoon feature counterpart and offers a likeable and memorable Aladdin. Tweaked for the better by August and Ritchie actor Naomi Scott lifts the Princess Jasmine character even more, while also giving her a social and political subtext.Although a good performance, Marwan Kenzari's Jafar has been reworked. August gives him and Aladdin a commonality but unfortunately it doesn't work as well as the cartoon stereotype villain did and sadly Alan Tudyk Iago suffers too. There's not much chemistry. This aside, Abu the monkey and the Magic Carpet are finely brought to life and are just as much fun as their animated incarnations. The dance numbers are fun and wonderful choreographed.Children and adults of all ages can enjoy.

Good comedy,"I was excited watching this movie as this is one of my favorite Disney movies and A Whole New World is a favorite song too. All that excitement turns to disappointment though. I understand that as a ""live"" action version of the animated film, they had to make it human and realistic. However, as magical the original was, the live action was not able to portray the same, which the film is mostly about. It feels like the creator was torn between making it human and magical. The effects and cgi is not that good. Compare to other films which are originally live actions(Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings), I can't understand why they're not able to do the same level of ""magic"" with the scenes that requires it. Prime example is the encounter at the end, where Jafar got hold of Genie. That scene turned out a plain dialogue. The acting is particularly not convincing. Example is when Aladdin was thrown out to water from the window. I would've expected Genie to act more hysterical or otherwise acted it out funny, but, it turns out awkward. There are times Abu, the monkey, would just take all the attention from the actors. He was the savior of all the dull and awkward scenes in the movie. Not to mention Jafar, the acting was plain and boring. Nothing you'd expect from a wicked villain. Jasmine's character up to the end had no progression. Finally, the film is generally for kids and would easily convince them from the not so good acting and effects, but can't understand the purpose of adding politics(feminism) in it. It was just unnecessary.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Will Smith Save This Movie.,"Review:
'Aladdin' is an American musical-fantasy film directed by Guy Ritchie. It is a live-action adaptation of Disney's 1992 animated film of the same name. Upon watching this movie, I was skeptical due to the fact I didn't believe they would be able to capture the same magic that the 1992 animated film had. At times this movie really shined, but that didn't happen until the second and third act. I was almost ready to turn the movie off after the first act. It didn't grasp your attention at all, and everything was lackluster and boring.
The film follows Aladdin (Mena Massoud) a street urchin, as he falls in love with Princess Jasmine (Naomi Scott) befriends a wish-granting Genie (Will Smith) and battles the wicked Jafar (Marwan Kenzari).
This movie didn't take off at all until Will Smith was introduced. His charisma and funny attitude towards Aladdin and certain situations were amazing. He stole every scene he was in and basically saved this movie from a bad review. I could care less about the other characters in this movie aside from Genie, Aladdin and Jasmine. Jaffar, who is supposed to be this big bad was not scary or menacing at all and I do believe that is because the actor did not have what it takes to pull the character off. It just fell flat. I really enjoyed Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott's portrayal as Aladdin and Jasmine. Their chemistry together was real, and it felt like the characters could come off the screen and live in the real world. However, as I said the rest of the characters fell short and you don't care what happens or even remember who they are when they come on screen another time.
I told myself I would not be comparing this to the 1992 animated film, but it's hard not to compare Genies. Will Smith did a great job in this movie and took on what was thought to be an impossible role and made it his own. I did still find myself missing Robin Williams when it came to the music numbers. I will say what I liked the most with this movie is the ending. Man did it stick the landing on that ending. It made you feel so many emotions. Now, I'm not one to complain about CGI when it's from a movie that has a low budget such as an Indie film or even a B-rate production company. When it's Disney and you see things like Marvel or The Lion King you know they can produce good CGI and this movie fell short in that aspect.
Overall, this movie fell hard in the first act and was lucky people stuck around for the second and third because the movie does a 180 turn and takes off. If you want a fun adventure film this one will do that for sure, and if you're a fan of the original this one keeps its core values as well as throwing in some fresh elements.

Musical Dazzling but Poorly executed.,"Guy Ritchie's live-action remake of the 1992 animated jewel at times tries, at times doesn't really provides much effort to even recapture the original's charm, musical spectacle nor its famous extravaganza, lacking for the most part a solid structure towards its mimicking-script, or an evident direction that here its clearly imitating something far superior, the few good elements the movie possess relay on some visual aspects and a decently mediocre performance from the three lead roles.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Another Downright Terrible Remake.,"Since I've already jumped into this sea of Disney's unnecessary & unwarranted live-action adaptations of their beloved animation masterpieces, might as well check out a couple more of their insipid attempts before calling it quits. Next up in the line was Aladdin. My expectations were even lower. And it still managed to fare worse on all accounts.With its posters, previews & entire marketing screaming nothing but a parody, it's suffice to say that even the x-rated adaptation would've delivered better feels than what this awful remake had to offer. Devoid of all the great bits that made the 1992 original one of the best examples of its kind, Aladdin continues Disney's new-found mantra of denting their own legacy.Co-written & directed by Guy Ritchie, the film looks awful on the outside & is hollow from within. The characters are never convincing in their respective roles. VFX is all over the place, impressive on rare counts, terrible on other occasions. Actors aren't any good, for they all chip in with bad inputs, including Will Smith who takes the role of Genie yet acts like he's playing Will Smith.What it rehashes from the original looks n feels vastly inferior to the original. What it modifies or adds to the plot & characters ruins it even further. The musical numbers have the visual spectacle to some extent but not the heart & charm that made them mesmerising in the animated medium. Ritchie's direction is mediocre, performances are off-putting, and the entire cast is pretty much a miscast.A ghastly blend of weak direction, poor writing, unfunny wit, substandard production values, muddled editing, laughable characterisation & dull performances that never for once realises that the real strength of the 1992 animated musical fantasy lied in its simplicity. Filled to the brim with nothing but shortcomings, this latest adaptation of Aladdin doesn't hold a candle to its animated source, and is forgettable in every sense of the word.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

What could have been a great movie ends up an OK movie.,"They came up with a novel view point to the story. It was first the casting and then the execution of the script were less than adequate. The genie aladdin and the princes were what saved the day for disney. Jafar was the worst of the lot. And they even managed to ruin lagos and they were halfway to ruining a great chance. The sultan was so so. The music didn't help much either. And the choice of guy ritchie as the director is way beyond my comprehension. And i haven't been comparing this to the original animated version even. Even though i love the story of aladdin i have only watched it twice, every time i try to watch it i am frustrated by the images of jafar and lagos and i tend to go to the animated version.

I can tell you that I was satisfied.,"Growing up at home in the 90s with two younger siblings, Disney had it's spot on the top of the mountain as far as animated features went. And it's ambassador at the top of that mountain. ""Aladdin"".Needless to say our whole family wanted it done well. We wanted a strong cast, loyalty to the material and music, as well a performance that did justice to one of Robin Williams' most iconic performances.I can tell you that I was satisfied.The live action remake of Aladdin is strong. Not perfect, but it's worthy of it's animated counterpart that was a part of so many families that are looking to past the story on to the next generation.The story stars Mena Massoud as the title character, and Naomi Scott as Jasmine. The casting of Disney princesses will always come under scrutiny (see Emma Watson in the Beauty and the Beast remake) but Scott takes charge of the role with a powerful voice that really shines during the musical numbers. It's not a stretch to say it's her film.Now we have to talk about the Genie.Will Smith had the impossible task of following the late, great, Robin Williams' animated genie that remains to this day, one of the finest voice performances in history.Director Guy Ritchie was right to let Smith make the role his own, while staying loyal to the original. His vocal aren't quite the same on songs like ""Friend like me"" and ""Prince Ali"" but they ""get over the net""The special effects are first class Disney. Characters like Abu the monkey, Iago the parrot, and the Magic Carpet are wonderful and while the appearance of the Genie itself hasn't flown well with everyone, it's hard to imagine how they could have done it differently in a fashion that would have remained original.All in all, Ritchie's ""Aladdin"" is fine. Capturing the magic of Disney animated classics is not an easy filmmaking feat but this is a carpet ride worth taking.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Pandering to SJWs. Ruined what could be great,"The movie was good when it stayed true to its source material. But the feminist undertone was too loud and obnoxious. When done correctly as we seen in Frozen it's brilliant, but when you're taking a classic Disney movie and remaking it. Remake it. Don't change it up with extra nonsense.

A magical experience without the usual Disney virtue signals,"I remember my thrill and exhilaration when I first saw Optimus Prime in a real life (well CGI anyway) in the movies which brought the Transformers cartoons to ""real life"". It was all in the recognition and I felt like a little kid in a candy store. I've never felt the same about any other movie. Until now, thanks to Aladdin.When I was younger I watched the animated version of Aladdin three times - yes three times - in the movies. I loved the show. So I held my breath when I went to watch the real life 2019 version of Aladdin (and a blue CGI genie of course) movie. I was worried Disney would trash any semblance of the original animated Aladdin with their usual in-your-face, virtue-signalling, activist crap (like they did on Star Wars: The Last Jedi) or removing the very essence of the characters they portray (like they did with Tolkien, removing the man's Christian faith from the man himself).I found myself feeling like a kid again, mesmerised by the wonder and fun that is Agrabah and Aladdin. It was movie magic all over again, all thanks to a brilliant cast and producer Guy Ritchie. The cast, ok, where do I start. Mena Massoud captured the very essence of cheeky, suave and big-eyed Aladdin - it's quite incredible that he managed to, at times, mimick the animation! Naomi Scott capably represented the beautiful, steady and confident Princess Jasmine - she had guts, she stands on her own, she is also all-heart. Both of them had a very cute chemistry that was reminiscent of the animated movie many years earlier. Will Smith truly and successfully made the genie his own, down to the funny antics. Marwan Kenzari played a much younger looking Jafar than in the movies, but this also worked alongside the main characters. Oh and the monkey Abu, is just too cute.I believe what makes this Aladdin movie a real success is twofold. Firstly, it respects the original film - the beautiful songs, the familiar settings, Agrabah's look and feel, the blue genie, the young Aladdin and Jasmine - they're all there. If you loved the animated Aladdin the way I did, you'd love this live ""real"" version of Aladdin. Secondly, it also stamped it's own mark to differentiate itself from the original film. The dance sequences were a mix of the traditional and modern, a fusion of cultural dances. The familiar songs were arranged differently and felt contemporary. Aladdin and Jasmine, by virtue of being real humans, really maximised the ""reality"" factor of what is supposed to be a mere fairy tale. And Will Smith successfully stepped out of Robin Williams' genie, and truly made this genie his own - this was important because if Will Smith tried to be a Robin Williams, the genie would've failed miserably. Nah, this blue genie is a completely different character (only Will Smith can play THIS genie) at the core, yet retained the jovial, fun-loving and irreverent personality that embodies the genie. The only one who is very different in terms of look and feel was Jafar, and that was OK. This Jafar felt modern and younger, though I think they could've made him a bit more ""sneakier"" in the looks department. All in all, I loved the cast.Honestly, I watched this new Aladdin movie, completely entranced by the colourful, beautiful, ""Whole New World"" of Agrabah, and yet I immediately connected with every single character as they appeared, down to the flying carpet itself - this movie is all heart, all beauty, all humour, everything you'd want in a movie. This is truly one of the best movies I've watched in years. Honestly, this was a wonderful, magical experience. I highly recommend this - well done to the cast and crew of this show. I'll be watching it again! Highly highly highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Aladdin (2019),"I honestly didn't know what I was going into and it was such a delightful surprise! It really exceeded my expectations and I had fun during the whole movie. Critics are really being harsh and I can't believe that beauty and the beast was more critically praised. The movie was so bland and boring while this one has so much energy and life to it. The characters had amazing chemistry with each other and the lines were delivered smoothly. The two things I was worried about that subsided as soon as the movie started are: 1- Jafar's character: Marwan tries his best to make but the material he's given isn't strong enough. I wish they developed his character more. However, I didn't mind the change they did it with his character as it fits more with this version. 2- Cultural representation: The trailers made the movie look like a production from bollywood. Not hating on the Indian culture, but it really annoyed me as Arab to see a Middle Eastern/Arabic folk tale that we all know long before Disney introduced it to the world to be represented in a fully different culture. Fortunately, the movie looks and feels way more Arabian such Arabic writings here and there, hearing some people speaking Arabic briefly, the names and appearance of the people of Agrabah and of course the amazing score! Although there are some slight hints of India/South Asia in the clothing and dancing, but I didn't mind that at all.I would've give it a 10 if the cinematography was better. This is my only issue with movie as it looked like high budget TV soap opera in some scenes.Don't miss on this one! You'll have fun.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Slightly disappointing,"My favorite Disney animated movie is Aladdin. I was expecting this to be pretty good but I was disappointed.

I really wanted to like this but I think the actors could've brought a lot more to their roles. It's not terrible but it's not great either.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Pretty disappointing,"I won't get into spoilers for this review but I was really disappointed at this movie. I'm not saying that this movie has only bad stuff. It has some good stuff, for example it's not boring and the scenery looks pretty nice. But except for that, I thought that the movie was kinda bad. I don't know if it's just me but the CGI looked a little dated and the music was kinda weird. I loved the original Aladdin and I like the fact that they changed some stuff. But the changes don't hold up, especially if we're talking about the music. I have nothing against autotune but it is so overused to the point that you can hear it.
What I especially didn't like were the actors. They weren't horrible, but they were still bad. I wasn't convinced about the chemistry between the characters, it didn't feel real. But Will Smith was pretty okay.

I almost felt something for him when they mentioned his backstory, but they completely missed the opportunity for a 3 dimensional character.Aladdin and Jasmine has no chemistry.

"A vibrant & grand, if a bit bland rendition of the animated classic","Aladdin (2019) has had a lot of problems going into its release. A poorly-received initial trailer/teaser was the starting of a press run that frankly, made me nothing but uninterested for the film.
Needless to say, I wasn't planning on watching it but due to certain circumstances, I ultimately wounded up seeing the movie dubbed in the local language with a couple of my friends.So.....was it worth the $5? Umm, kinda.You see, it's a Disney live-action film through and through. It's a crowd-pleasing cash grab. The Mouse has made sure that your eyeballs are glued onto the screen for most of the runtime. It offers enough musical interludes and dances to sustain the attention of the 12 year olds that comprise the movie's target demographic. There's nothing particularly noteworthy about the film per se, but I cannot help but notice the sheer amount of hard work that has been done by the production department. The costumes, props, etc. were all A+. But that's all a given considering it's Disney money.The director has done an 'okay' job and the actors are all pretty fine. (pun intended)
Interestingly enough, Will Smith was probably one of the best things in the movie. He has the perfect amount of charisma and bravado to pull off the role of the Genie!The writing is sloppy and the story runs out of steam rather quickly as the villain is so poorly-written, in comparison to the Jafar of the original Aladdin, who was so much more menacing. The ending doesn't have the required tension and emotional weight, either. Really bland, imo.Regardless, Aladdin (2019) is clearly a good business decision on Disney's part as live action remakes seem to be their thing as long as they keep doing well at the Box Office.
Ultimately, it's a good time with the family and has enough frills and fancies to keep those little ones engaged.PS:- Don't watch the original before going to the cinema. You would only be disappointed with how certain elements don't really pan out well in the live-action.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Fun IMAX experience,"Very fast paced, incredibly well coordinated - yet a darker adaptation than I was expecting so I must say I prefer the original. This was definitely heartwarming though, especially the genie adding so much enthusiasm!Guy Ritchie has done some masterpieces like Snatch and Rock n' Rolla in my opinion, so his take is definitely a nice touch, although scary too or at least it would be for kids, otherwise not bad. The editing is spot on, so is the dancing and effects; I'll admit it had some cheesy lines too. Regardless, definitely would recommend.Please don't dislike this just cause the way I worded things and mentioned 2 different aspects. The movie is awesome the way it is; also I have Asperger's syndrome.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Jafars Face,"AladdinOkay so I saw the original Aladdin sometime ago before I turned 10 years old so this review is pretty unbiased. Aladdin is played by Mena Massoud and Princess Jasmin is played by Naomi Scott. It goes without mention that Will Smith plays the iconic genie that was previously played the late Robin Williams. There were some surprising elements in this movie so let's get started.The movie jumps off pretty quickly. I was surprised that Aladdin didn't get much of an introduction to who and what he is. I was ironically also fooled that Princess Jasmin made such a quick appearance and believed when she said she isn't the princess and is Dalia. The introduction to both characters and love interest all happens in about ten minutes which I thought was pretty quick. It was like somebody put their hands up and said whoa whoa whoa because the movie does slow down quite a bit. Aladdin is charismatic and his bond with the monkey, Abu, really shine through and you clearly get that Aladdin is a good dude and only does what he can to survive. Basically he's not greedy despite the monkey taking Jasmin's bracelet that her mother gave her.The same is true for the Villain Jafar who is played by Marwan Kenzari. He's introduced very quickly and I wasn't sure what his place was in the kingdom. As mentioned, the movie does slow down a bit and the characters arcs are well established. We know what they want and we're locked in for the ride. In comes Will Smith. I was so surprised by Will Smith. He got so much backlash from the media, but honestly, i think he was the best part of the movie. You can accept this if you accept that this isn't Robin Williams. Simple as that. It was definitely an uphill battle for him and he clearly earned his paycheck. It was a little odd seeing him blue, but it's really not that bad at all.This does bring me to the set and wardrobe for the movie as well. This is totally a Disney movie in the way that everything is perfect. Despite the set of the scene being sandy and dirty (he is a thief) everybody is spic and span clean. That's probably being petty and I agree. The Set is something that kind of takes away from the movie for me. The set was so pristine that it didn't allow for the disconnect from reality that we crave when watching a movie. Rather than a film, it was almost like a play. Don't get me wrong, it's a beautiful movie to watch, but the attempt to make it like the animation didn't translate so great film wise if that makes sense.This brings me to the acting. Now I know that acting is an extremely tough job but some characters fell short. Aladdin for example is charismatic and the skill is obviously there, but the clumsiness and not knowing what to do kind of drags for a while and begs for a relief. Naomi Scott however does a very good job in the acting as well as the singing. She has a great voice and shines in the song A Whole New World. Hands down a great performance. I also felt that Mena and Naomi did have some great on-screen chemistry. I have seen better but it's nothing to complain about. On the other hand, I'm not sure what was going with the close ups and camera angles. It may have been the wardrobe and play like set up that made this feel a bit corny. There's a couple close ups of Jafar that are almost comical and over the top. The cinematography of the film really gives this movie some extra lives. Especially in the climax.Overall this was a good movie and i did enjoy it a lot. I was pleasantly surprised by Will Smith's performance, Naomi's voice and acting, the brightness and vivid cinematography and Mena's and Naomi's chemistry made for a good movie. With all this in mind I'm going to give this movie 6.8/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Welcome Back to Agrabah,"Disney's live action remake of their 1992 classic was fun and entertaining. Will Smith, Naomi Scott, and Mena Massoud were all good in their performances, it had some good funny moments, and the songs were great, with props to the new song Speechless being phenomenal. Smith gave his own spin on Genie and I think he would've made Robin Williams proud with his portrayal. Where the film has issues is in the CGI and the direction. Will Smith's blue genie CGi didn't look great and some of the shots with Abu and the carpet didn't look the best. Guy Ritchie's direction didn't really go well with the film. For example, during the One Jump Ahead scene, his directorial style shines through and it doesn't work well with the song or sequence. Also one major note was Jafar's portrayal. Nothing against Marwan Kenzari's performance, he did fine, but with the way Jafar was written he wasn't menacing and creepy like he was in the original. He was just a guy trying to rule. Also Iago looked fine but I just couldn't get behind Alan Tudyk voicing him. Aladdin was a fairly good remake, but here's hoping that The Lion King beats out The Jungle Book as the best Disney live action remake.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Fantastic Live Adaptation of a Disney Animated Classic,"I honestly wanted to hate this movie. I didn't want to give it a chance after the photos of Will Smith as Genie leaked. I thought it was going to be completely ridiculous. Well, I was wrong. This is yet another solid live screen adaptation to a Disney animated classic. Guy Ritchie did a fantastic job directing a multi-cultural cast of actors and actresses full-filling the roles of the main characters. As someone of Arabic descent who grew up reading One Thousand and One Arabian Nights, a collection of old Arab folk tales which included the story of Aladdin, I highly appreciated the fact that Disney did not ""white cast"" this movie and instead sought out a collection of multi-talented Arab, Indian, and Persian actors. The big question everyone has been asking is if Will Smith was able to fill the shoes of the late great Robin Williams. Well, while Robin Williams lent his voice to the role of Genie, Smith went beyond the voice acting. He was spectacular in his role as the Genie of the lamp, and mentor/guide to Aladdin and led his experience as a singer/dancer, comedian, and actor to the role. He took the silly mannerisms and comedic elements of Williams' Genie and infused them with what we've all come to know and love of The Fresh Prince, to bring the role of Genie to life. Overall this was a fantastic film. If you're a fan of Disney musicals, which have not been present for a number of years, you'll truly enjoy this film. It is one of the best versions of Aladdin, full of magical wonderment. It's colorful, entertaining, and absolutely beautiful. This is the first time that you will see the setting of Agraba. Overall, a standing ovation of Guy Ritchie, his cast, and his production team. Well done.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

"Disney's ""Woke"" Nonsense starting to affect the quality of their movies","The live action adaptations of the Disney movies are a great idea being ruined by the social justice warriors running the company now. Beauty and the Beast was set in the 18th century and featured minorities all over France in the town Belle lived in, some even in high-ranking posts they had no chance of realistically holding in those days. Princess Jasmine all of a sudden has her eyes on becoming a Sultan and even has a ""girl power"" musical number? Really guys?Now, you would think that Disney would follow the formula in Beauty and the Beast and cast all sorts of races as the townspeople in Agrabah, right? Nope, everyone is either Middle Eastern or black, which is believable for Arabia in the Middle Ages. So why get so militant about blatantly misrepresenting 18th century Parisian town demographics and history but then faithfully cast Agrabah with historically accurate demographics? Practice what you preach because you're hypocrites.The Jasmine ""girl power"" nonsense didn't sit right with me either. I wanted to walk out. It was so obnoxoius. It may be a good reason the box office as well as the reviews for this movie suffered. It was just incredibly stupid and unrealistic. If Disney continues in this direction, I will not watch their movies anymore. I'm not paying money to be lectured by liberals.I felt Will Smith was miscast. I love him but this wasn't right for him. Mena Massoud as Aladdin did a great job, Naomi Scott was upstaged as Jasmine by Nasim Pedrad, her handmaiden. That's not supposed to happen! Nasim was a far more believable Jasmine than Naomi. total miscast! The rest of the casting was spot on aside from Disney's hypocrisy with casting the townspeople. If you're going to set the tone that it's a fantasy and people of all races can be anywhere, do it in all of your movies or you will look foolish, thanks.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
I really wanted to love this... but I just can't.,"I read reviews of people saying this is better than the original and cannot help but wonder what drugs they're on. I'd 100% take the voice actors in the original over the flat sounding, less emotional normal actors. Like it's colorful, it's got nice graphics, but it just doesn't have the same excitement. It's not really even something I'd play in the background on netflix. I'm really not trying to rain on the film, I just don't like the character of it. I grew up on Fairy Tale Theater and their version of Aladdin, as old as I am, still captures my attention more even without flashy colors or fancy computer generated tigers. Like.. that's old, but their characters still had more flare and personality. I think Disney is a little too reliant on how much you loved the original. If you aren't in love with the original, you really don't sit on the edge of your seat for these characters imo.",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

A laudable effort,"I'd say this is more like it. Aladdin is merely the latest in the recent long line of Disney live-action remakes. So far all of them have been disappointments. At least to yours truly. All so far have had at least a few redeeming qualities, but they have all paled in comparison to the originals. It's hard to turn animation to live-action, it seems. There's energy and vibrancy to animation, which Disney has always been a master of utilizing. And that energy doesn't translate very well when you need to be more realistic.Which is why I think it was exactly the right call to hand this film over to Guy Ritchie. The man has been directing live-action animation films his whole career, frankly speaking. If there's something that has never been missing in his films, it's energy.And I can safely say I like what he has done with his source material. This Aladdin pays homage to the original Disney animated film, but is confident enough to move past it, to extrapolate, to change things, to even improve. And while I still vastly prefer the original, I think this will be the first Disney live-action remake, which I will return to.So what works? Well, as I already said, the film is not afraid to mix things up a little bit. It's still mostly the same story, but it's not identical. Jasmine's role, for one, has been expanded by a whole lot, which I find to be a great thing. The original Jasmine was a feisty thing, but she didn't have that much to do in the film, aside from being the love interest. Sure, she distracted Jafar at that one point, but that's about it. This Jasmine has much more of her own voice, her own part to play. And I like it!Will Smith's Genie is also pretty different, a lot grumpier for one, which I also like. It would have been hard to beat Robin Williams, so I'm glad they didn't even try. Most of the extra run-time of this film compared to the original is spent with either Jasmine or Genie and they're all good, funny scenes.So what doesn't work? Well, Jafar for one. I like the small hints we get at his backstory, but aside from that he's a much more subdued version of the original. And it's such a disappointment. The original Jafar was a magnificent villain, one of Disney's best. I guess they were afraid to go too over the top, but that's unfortunately exactly what was needed here. Something more bombastic and menacing. This guy says his lines very placidly, very calmly, very methodically. And it's just not that scary.And while I applaud the film for trying for something similar yet different, there are moments in the film that are pretty much identical to the original film. They're also the moments I found myself caring the least about, because I had already seen them.The film also isn't quite as interesting visually as the animated version. It looks amazing, don't get me wrong, but the more realistic look means that they can't go as over the top crazy as they did in the original. And that loss is felt.Still, even though most of this review was spent comparing the film to its animated predecessor, I truly do feel that this is the first Disney live-action remake that can stand on its own two feet. It has the energy and creativity to awe its audience without the crutch of nostalgia. Kudos, Disney. You finally did it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Disney insists on auto-tuning AGAIN!,"Don't cast actors who can't sing. EURGH!Anyway, that aside, Will Smith is charismatic as hell but he's still no Robin Williams. The difference is jarring.
The story has been tweaked here and there but I feel they've made it weaker.
The 2 leads were good as Aladdin and Jasmine but the casting for Jafar was terrible.

Pretty Good,"OK, so Will Smith is playing himself. But it's controlled so he is entertaining and witty without being intrusive. The effects are such that they do not obscure the movie.

"It's not the original, but it's not trying to be","So Disney is obviously looking to make some easy cash by remaking their classic animated movies from the 90s, but as a live remake. The movie is actually solid, and one of the better live remakes actually. Great things were how they did the Genie and put their own spin on the story. Bad thing was, I don't think the guy that played Aladdin was very strong.With Robin Williams being dead and having put his signature on the role, it was hard enough to think of someone for the role. Will Smith actually did a great job! Once you get past the obvious auto-tune and how jarring it is for him to look like the Genie. Like I kid you not, it was very weird when he first came on screen as the Genie, much like the trailers. That's part of why I think it got such a bad reputation because he looks like a meme in the worst of ways when he first comes on screen. Though his charisma and jokes puts that on the back burner and you actually get used to him in his role. The route they took with his character and Will Smith's take on the role was genius. You can't compete with Robin Williams, but you can get away from that put your own touch on the role. Will Smith did just that, which I think was the smart thing to do.How they changed a few scenes and added more story and gave us great scenery, it was great. They didn't try to compete with the original movie, they recreated it, but they put their own touch on it. That's the smart thing to do with a classic. You keep the parts that everyone likes, looking at you Mulan, while also not copying it word for word, looking at you Lion King.The only bad thing is, Will Smith looked a bit weird in the beginning. Seriously, he's a meme for a reason, but to be fair to him, you get used to it pretty fast actually. Another thing is that the actor for Aladdin could've been better. He just doesn't have 'it' I'm afraid.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Some weird things here.,"First of all, the casting was not right. Second, the songs they added in for Jasmine were absolutely terrible. I felt like I was watching a 14 year old pop stars music video from the early 2000's. And lastly, what was so wrong with the part of Jasmine being a kidnapped slave for Jafar? Is this another PC thing Disney's shoving down our throats? Because honestly I don't think it was a big deal. It actually really emphasizes how evil Jafar is in the cartoon, so I don't know why you're trying to make him look better.",1.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Fortunately the charismatic presence and the witty humor of Will saved the day!In the end it's lacking the usual grandeur feel of a Disney fantasy film that's why it might not be for Everyone out there!Children might like this film a lot for the colorful presentation and the visual treat but for the matured audience especially those who have nostalgic feels about the Original Aladdin Animation Feature ; They Might regret watching this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

7/10 GOOD MOVIE ... BUT IT DOES NOT FEEL NATURAL 😕,"I tried to feel the nostalgic of my favorite Disney animated movie and I did not feel it. ""Genie"" by Will Smith was excellent, but I felt that they did not get the most out of it.The costumes of Jafar, Jasmin and the Sultan, I loved...Aladdin not so much 😕. Their performance was nice. They changed the attitude and style of Jafar (I do not bother so much) and gave another focus to Jasmin which I liked a lot.In scenography design was neat, but it felt that Agrabah was small and the Palace too, that was the ""feeling"" that created the atmosphere. As if it had been done in a Broadway theater.The dances and the songs were ...... meh. Maybe was too frequent and very little ""Flashy"" for how it felt in the animated movie. The same with the parts that should be funny they were (hehe). And the scene that should have been the most romantic ..... weeeeeeeell. Ok I'm not satisfied and I think it's already clear. 😅They left details that were cool and they added others that were not soooo bad.OVERALL, it is not a bad movie at all, good to see it with the family.

Three reasons why Aladdin is worth to watch,"Aladdin is a street urchin, and he falls in love with Princess Jasmine one day while saving her, then befriends a wish-granting genie and battles an evil enemy named Jafar. His journey then begins. I think that the three reasons why Aladdin is worth to watch is because of the costume designs, memorable songs and great choreography.
Jasmine is one of my favorite Disney princesses and one reason is because I love her wardrobe. The designers scouted locations in Africa, Turkey and Pakistan to search beautifully colored and richly woven fabrics and textiles. That reason is to colorfully saturate the world they were creating on screen. Every corner in Aladdin was so alive with playful hues of red, orange, and blue and when the music played, the colors seemingly explode and dancing by themselves.
Not only hearing the classic Aladdin songs, there just might be something new in store as well. Jasmine sang a new song ""Speechless"", this part of the film is the scene that she sings out her feelings and not crushing down by anyone. Jasmine gave us the courage she never gave before, and had a different kind of charm. The director made the characters feel more contemporary, both lyrically and musically. The songs in the film were embedded in the music of the Arab world with flourishes of jazz here and there.
Comparing to the original animated film, it added a lot of movements, acrobatics and dancing into it. Seeing these feats translate to live action is mesmerizing. The choreography stands out much more than it does in the animated version. The stunts were breathtaking and the dancing was fresh and modern, the amount of work that had to go into each and every scene is very professional.
Aladdin and Jasmine taught us to be who we are. Don't try to be someone else or to conform to what others perceive us to be, be who you are meant to be. The movie also taught us the importance of friendship both good and bad. I think the movie is really worth to watch because of its costume designs, memorable songs and great choreography.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Aladdin have become a Bollywood movie,"With such expectations before its release i quickly become dissapointed when i watch the trailer.New ""Aladdin"" is a colorful Bollywood flirt where Aladdin has become an invulnerable superhero and Jasmine a modern feminist.It is of course difficult to see ""Aladdin"" but to compare with Disney's 1992. So how does Guy Ritchie's version do? A large part of what attracts Disney's projects of recreating their old films is to experience realistic versions of their classic cartoons. The live action-world Agrabah is colorful and exciting. The environments feel familiar but fresh and attractive. What you have not really succeeded with is the characters. Both good and evil. Both for good and for bad. Naomi Scott, who plays Jasmine. However, Aladdin is much more shy and withdrawn. It's not the same charming and confident thief we are used to.Now he is just miserable.

Aladdin review,"I tried to like this movie but I couldn't. Disney Live Action remakes just aren't good. All the Live Action remakes are only made for money. They bank too heavily on nostalgia which I don't like. I feel that this movie should not have been made. I feel the same way about any Live Action remake that has been released or is coming out. Here are some positives. Most of the cast does a good job. Will Smith isn't trying to beat out Robin Williams as the Genie but still does a great job. The soundtrack is decent. It's still incredibly catchy but not as catchy as the original. The only song I feel that is better in this movie is Arabian Nights. All the other songs are good but not as outstanding as the original. Unfortunately, the negatives outweigh the positives. The pacing of this film is way off. It feels rushed at certain points and the end of the film starts to drag and it takes too long. It also doesn't help that this film is 38 minutes longer than the original. Marwan Kenzari is a decent actor but he didn't do a good job in this film. In my opinion, he didn't know what to do with the character. Jafar never felt like a major threat during the film which is a problem because he is the main villain. There were some changes that were made to the story but I felt they really didn't work for me. Jasmine's added character arc was a big meh for me. It felt a little out of place within the narrative. The new songs they added were meh for me. They aren't as memorable as the other songs in the film. The effects on the Genie are still as bad as they were in the trailer which was very distracting. The film is very brightly lit which makes it feel like a Disney Channel Original Film. There are also some slow motion scenes that come out of nowhere and make no sense at all. Overall, Aladdin may have a half decent score but fails to capture the magic of the original film. I give Aladdin a 2/10.",2.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Hit or miss,"The acting in this movie was all over the place. There were some moments where they were amazing, like in their new scenes, and other moments where the acting/singing felt forced and more like a Bollywood/Highscool Musical movie rather than the original Disney movie. Luckily, as the movie progresses, so does its performance. We start seeing more and more passion from the actors/actresses and even get a glimpse of some quirky Disney charm, which is almost enough to save the whole movie.Marwan Kenzari's Jafar is by far the biggest disappointment of this movie. Instead of seeing the cunning and intelligent Royal Vizier, we get a very bland and boring little helper. He alone almost ruins the whole movie. He shows less facial expressions than Kirsten Stewart and is more monotone than a speak and spell. Sad to see such a great character wasted.This movie was saved partially by the increased performance in the second half, and by the overall performances of Naomi Scott and Will Smith.Naomi Scott, whose powerful and independent take was a bit to get used to, makes us look back to 1992 and wish they had shown more of Jasmine. We get to see how she struggles with being trapped inside the walls of the palace and deprived of the power she so eagerly desires. It was definitely a nice change of paceWill Smith's version of the Genie, if Robin Williams' rendition didn't exist, was really superb and modern. Unfortunately for Smith, Robin Williams aced the Genie roll and, though he did a great job, Will Smith couldn't quite fill the shoes Williams left behind.Overall, it both went above, and well below my expectations and was just a rollercoaster of phenomenal and horrendous acting.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Not a single line is delivered with any passion or emotion, it feels like the table read when the cast first meets. Aladdin has no charm at all, he's generic at best.
Jafar isn't intimidating at all, why is he so short? The costume overpowers the actor & seems to weigh him down. In the animated version Jafar was much taller than any of the other characters, he had a long, lanky & almost snake like appearance which made him a menacing character from the first moment he's seen. This version has zero draw as a villain, he blends in with the background actors & is very bland. His portrayal comes off like a stepdad who's trying to act like a parent but has no idea how to be an actual authority figure.
The marketplace scene when Aladdin ""sings"" one jump is basically a shot for shot remake but with very small but odd changes, the choreography is stiff & unexciting. In the animated version when we first see jasmine she comes off as strong & independent despite being a bit naive about how things really are. She surprises Aladdin with her courage & strength from the get go, but in the live action she comes off as weak & lost. The biggest example of this is when they jump across the rooftops to avoid the guards, in the cartoon she grabs the pole & jumps across all on her own to the surprise of Aladdin, but in the live action she has to be coached & assured by Aladdin she can actually make the jump & will be ok - why this pointless change?
They include cgi versions of Abu & Iago but strip away any resemblance of a personality or character. These two were fantastic comic relief characters in the cartoon & could have translated to live much better. You don't have to have an animal talk to give it a personality or humor, Disney should have just used real animals if that's how they wanted them to act.
The Genie is just as boring & uninspired as everything else in this movie. During friend like me he tries far too hard to be different than the original & ""make it his own"" but comes off with no emotion or anything unique in the performance. I turned the movie off after this song so maybe it gets better, but from what I saw they took everything that was special about the original & drained the life from it. It truly takes skill to turn the most colorful, over the top & magical Disney movie into a dull shell of a story. After seeing this I am now absolutely terrified of the mess Disney is going to make of my personal favorite movie the Little Mermaid, please for the love of god stop making these live action remakes Disney!!!! They are ruining everything that makes these stories & their characters special & beloved by all.Ps - this doesn't have much to do with the story or acting why did Aladdin have so many clothes on? Cartoon version aside he's running, jumping & climbing around the literal dessert in the middle of the day. Also was he wearing fake hair of some sort? Something was off & it distracted me",2.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Disney charm but......,It has that wonderful Disney charm that makes you feel like your on a ride at Disney World. The music is great. The actors are charming. But the script was lacking in my opinion. Seemed repetitive and non-sensicle sometimes. and seemed to stall out and loose my attention with un-necessary scenes. The humor was ok but missed the mark for me at times. It could have been much better. But the visuals are the music are worth the ride.,6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Colourful and visually impressive but the characters don't stack up to Aladdin (1992),"I've been working through Guy Ritchie's filmography, and Aladdin is definitely an outlier, sandwiched in between King Arthur (which I really enjoyed) and The Gentlemen (2019). It's a relatively safe remake of the original Aladdin, especially amongst the raft of other live action Disney remakes that have flooded in over the past few years.The film is visually impressive, colourful and the CGI is fantastic. Will Smith is great as the Genie and the story stays true to the original.What felt missing was the magic from Aladdin (1992) and lack of personality in the characters - Jafar and the Sultan were especially iconic but here they don't have the same spark. I actually felt the same with Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott. Regardless it was still a decent remake and an enjoyable watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Disappointed,"If you're going into this thinking they did a shot for shot reproduction like they did with ""Beauty and the Beast"" you'll be disappointed. Fans of Robin Williams' version of Genie will be even more disappointed as Will Smith went completely away from honoring Williams' portrayal of Genie. Music was arranged differently from the originals, words modified to be politically correct, and they really pushed an agenda with the addition of a new song and changes to the storyline. Was only pleased with 2 scenes that somewhat kept with the original movie. Final thoughts: If Disney continues to ""remake"" the original cartoons, it would be better to stick with the original scripts and song arrangements and stay away from modifying the story.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
INCREDIBLE,From music to acting to singing to dancing to the cinematography everything was just incredible. Naomi Scott was definitely one of the best actresses I have seen as a Disney princess. Will Smith was mind blowing with his vocals. Mena Massoud was a very suitable candidate for Aladdin and he fulfilled the role beautifully. This is not a pun intended but this movie left me speechless!,9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
An entertaining nostalgic ride,"This version of Aladdin basically the same as the original, with just a few little changes. I like how in this version they make the princess stands up more for the equal rights of women. But unfortunately the song ""speechless"", imo felt terribly forced and misplaced.I LOVE Smith's genie in its true form, when he is not big and blue. I can see he is doing his best to differentiate his Genie from Robin Williams'. And i know this is unfair to compare since both was/is amazing actors. But sadly his blue form genie easily overshadowed. For me, Williams' genie still irreplaceable, thus made Smith's seems.... flat. And to make it worse, the CGI was so bad that i cringe inside (Lol) whenever he made any facial expression.Other low down for me is Jafar. I remember as a kid i could shiver just by hearing Jafar's voice. Imagine my disappointment when i saw this bland less menacing version of Jafar. 😣But all and all, this is not a total disappointment, IF.... If you dont overthink it.

"Another hollow, pointless remake banking on nostalgia","If you've been watching any of the Disney ""live action"" remakes that have plagued us the last the last several years, then this one should come as no surprise as it contains all the same pitfalls.The setting feels fake, they either filmed on a green screen or filmed on a soundstage with a green screen background/skyline.The music is generic and could've been crammed into any movie (even a non musical).The direction/editing is boring and uninspired containing lots of flat, static shots and predictable edits.There are slight alterations to the plot that you'll either love or hate.The acting is pretty bad for the most part Aladdin has no presence, Jasmine is ok, Jafar is terrible and isn't intimidating, Will Smith is surprisingly fine as the Genie (though I did go in with subterranean expectations), but the effects aren't good that and he slips into the creepy uncanny valley quite a lot.If you liked previous live action remakes, then you're almost sure to like this one. However if you find this trend of filmmaking uninspired, mediocre, and ultimately pointless, then skip this one and just watch the original.",1.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Disney sucks out the magic out of everything they remake,"This is the second Disney live-action remake I've seen after Beauty and the Beast and probably the last one. Just to be clear, the original Aladdin isn't among my top favourite Disney movies, but it was simple enough and had its charm in its simplicity and of course it had Robin Williams in it. Also, all the characters were unique and likeable in their own way. Overall, this remake gets very few good things from the original and sadly breaks a lot.
Where the remake succeeded:
+Will Smith was probably the most fun and enjoyable part of the whole movie. He managed to do a genie in his own way without trying to copy Robin Williams' from 1992. You can argue he was a bit too much himself, but I see nothing wrong with that.
+Mena Massound played a decent Aladdin. I'm guessing he could have done even better job if his character was written better, but sadly that was not the case.
+Some of the songs were a fresh addition considering the original didn't have that many.
+I also enjoyed the visuals especially watching it in 4K, even if CGI was too obvious at moments.
Where they missed the mark, but still remains watchable:
*Aladdin feels more like a Bollywood movie than anything else - from costumes to dances. I thought Agraba was in the Arabian Peninsula but apparently, they moved it to somewhere in South Asia.
* Naomi Scott, even though performing well, simply was not a good fit for playing Jasmine.
* The romance between the maid and the genie was completely unnecessary, distracting and quite forced. As a matter of fact her whole character was not needed and could have been left out.
* Iago was turned into just a dumb CGI bird and his screen time taken by the one mentioned above.
* Mena Massoud did a decent role at times, but the chemistry between Aladdin and Jasmine wasn't really there. Didn't buy the whole flying carpet scene. The one in the 1992 version was much better.
* It feels much less like a children's movie compared to the original. While it may appear more to parents, certainly won't be the same with kids.Where they failed badly:
*The actor portraying Jaffar was what almost ruined the whole movie for me. Arguably a story is only as good as it's antagonist and Marwan Kenzari just didn't fit. He was too young to be a vizier and was neither convicting nor menacing at any point. To make bad even worse they decided to make him just another thief. In the cartoon version he treated Aladdin like vermin, while here he almost sympathies with him. Doesn't make any sense.
*They threw in so much needless extra stuff which made them rush the main story. The original was more fleshed out in 90 minutes than this one in over 130. What you get as an end result is a story burdened with additions that extend it by almost 40 minutes and still adding nothing of value to the movie.
* How can some of the most memorable moments in the original be recreated so badly in the remake despite budget and everything. For example, the whole part of Aladdin in the cave, taking the lamp and escaping afterward felt rushed and boring.Watch it on Disney+ if you have free time. It's not a terrible movie, but nowhere near a classic.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
High budget B movie,"If you only watch the first minutes and the last ones, you may expect that it is a charming orientalist fantasy movie. Unfortunately, it is not. It is a frustrating badly-made ""live action"" remake with few good moments and, despite the high budget, a touch of a B-movie. Far from the magic of the original Disney animated feature, this film has very little to be positively highlighted besides the good performance of Will Smith as the djinni (as a matter of fact, this is the single not disapointing performance in the whole movie), some songs, the CGI animals and the look of the town from a distant sight (from close it looks like a theater stage). Casting was not a good one except for Will Smith. Although not properly bad actors and good singers, the leading couple is not skilled and charismatic enough to repeat the bond between Aladdin and Jasmine we saw in 1992 film. The major problem, however, was the villain: what a ridiculous acting performance and character conception for Jafar. The actor dos not look like Jafar, does not seem frightening, and looks like a reveler dressed for a carnival parade. Indeed, most outfits in this movie and Jafar's portrayal made me think that Dungeons and Dragons film was almost a Lord of the Rings. CGI animals are visually convincing, but have no charisma, differently from the ones in the animated film. Few of script innovations comparatively to 1992 story were good ones. Bollywood-like dancing scenes are appropriate and Aladdin's parkour was well made. Disney should have chosen a crew who loved the animated film to make this one, instead of calling a director who often makes kitsch unfortunate choices and is clearly building a mediocre career after great flicks ""Lock, stock and two smoking barrels"" and ""Snatch"". This ""Alafdin"" is a formulaic and full of clichés film and does not bring espectator to Agrabah as 1992 movie did.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
A wonderful fairytale,"Unfortunately most of the professional critics consumed in a shallow and totally technical approach to this charming film.
Ritchie offers us an exquisite, multicolored look at Agraba in a high aesthetic style, lustrous costumes, unforgettable choreographies and amazing songs, an intelligent rhythm of narration and only the necessary inventiveness (remember that the films arent a contest of story reversal!)
Excellent cast choices and here we need a parenthesis ,
Concerning the interpretation of the theatrical Marwan Kozari as Jafar, it is worth to have in mind that the scripts have given a different approach to his role. In particular, the imposing dark and sardonic (self) sarcastic of the original, the live action version has a greater depth. It is about a more realistic, human character where his obsession with absolute power is in fact a human weaknesses - the slowness of the immoral personal recognition - not as a sinister malicious wicked magician but a high-ranking member of the palace of his time with magical qualities insidious diplomacy , and expansive dreams And general , he brilliantly surroundswithout overshadowing ,the exeptional star-twin (Outstanding Massoud ,Naomi Scott its a revelation) , where with delightful Smith who gives his own unique perfomance show they advocate a wonderful all-time classic fairytale where, although familiar, it continues to fascinate.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Jafar, however did not match their standards and almost never seemed villainous enough.
The movie made a few changes from the cartoon which actually make the story more sensible so I didn't mind these changes at all, in fact, it was required for the movie.
Overall, the movie is different from the cartoon in some aspects but they were pleasant necessary changes that make the movie enjoyable with its own charms.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

A Slight Rise In Quality,"This is about as good as Disney Live Action Remakes get. It's a fairly entertaining almost 2 hours. I thought that Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott were good enough as Aladdin and Jasmine, and Will Smith, though obviously not as good as Robin Williams, does his best, and brings his own spin to the character of the Genie. But Marwan Kenzari as Jafar gives the most underwhelming performance. He just isn't intimidating enough, and isn't that interesting to look at. Everyone else doesn't really go much of interest.
There's only one new song (which is just there for that Oscar nomination), ""Speechless"". And as far as emotional power ballads go, it's not bad. Most of the covers of hr original songs, are good, but nothing special. Visually, everything is alright, just very bright and a little harsh on the eye.

POOR,1.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
"A Slightly Flawed, But Excellent Film","For my first noting, I'd like to start with the film's ensemble cast, casting, performances, and characters.Mena Massoud, first off, was awesome as Aladdin! Extremely perfect for the part! I'm not sure how many people think this, but he looked so much like the character from the original film, and performed him so well, that it was like the actual character was in the building! To boot, Massoud did an excellent job at bringing in his own flair, personality, and dimensionalism to the character.Admittedly, the Aladdin in this version certainly isn't as smart as the Aladdin in the animated film, but, he's still quick-witted, clever, and as kind as ever. The character also had some great development throughout the film, not just like in the original Disney classic, but...he developed through having to come to terms with who he is as a person, as well as trying to keep his moral compass alive.Naomi Scott's casting and performance as Jasmine is another element of the movie I highly commend. I know that there was some early criticism about Scott's casting in the early stages of the film, but, in all honesty, she fit the role of Jasmine like a pea in a pod! She killed it! She was not only able to preserve the character's rebelliousness and desire for independence, she also gave her character a newfound sense of authority and leadership, not just for herself, but for others. Just like Massoud, she even made it seem like the real deal was actually there.Jasmine herself even had some newfound development, building throughout the film to show the marks of a true leader.The addition of Jasmine's best friend and handmaiden, Dalia, proved to be really fun too. So did Nasim Pedrad's performance and casting. I know that many have likely passed over Pedrad and her character, but...Pedrad did a wonderful job at portraying Dalia, giving her great personality and comedic-timings. Plus, Dalia proved to be such an essential part of the whole film, that you'd be left wishing the character was in the original animated classic.But, perhaps the best cast member out of everyone, who also gave the most winning performance of all in this movie...is Will Smith, and his character of the Genie. Truthfully, when I found out that Smith was going to be portraying the Genie, I was a little skeptical, mainly because of how much Robin Williams truly owned the role. However, as time went on, it suddenly clicked in my head that he would fit the part wonderfully, especially after seeing his work in ""Hitch"" and recalling his comedic moments in ""Independance Day"" (both of which I deeply apologize for not reviewing yet, by the way). I was overjoyed by the announcement that he wasn't going to be directly copying Robin Williams, so it made me all-the-more interested in seeing Smith in the role.And you know what?Will Smith really rocked the house as the Genie!He did such a terrific job portraying the character by making the role something of his own. He even brought fantastic energy and emotion to the character, as well as gave him comedic-timings and a personality that made his Genie all-the-more different from Robin Williams's Genie. Additionally, he did a brilliant job developing his character into someone really human.Now if I'm going to be honest, there was one element of the casting and performances that I wasn't a big fan of:Marwan Kenzari, and his casting and portrayal as Jafar.I have nothing against the actor personally, he's obviously quite talented (that considering he's likely not among the most famous, such as Smith), and I was willing to give him a chance and see if he could surprise me, partly due to not wanting to judge him based on the trailers alone.The problem, however (and that comes from after seeing the whole film), is that Kenzari was awfully miscast. He was too young for the part of Jafar, and because of Jafar's youth, it makes one question how long he was the Sultan's Royal Vizier to begin with. Additionally, it seemed like no matter how far Kenzari extended himself as an actor, he just wasn't able to make the character threatening or imtimidating enough. It is especially compared to Jonathan Freeman's portrayal in the original film, even voice-wise. Kenzari's efforts literally didn't make the character someone to take seriously in this movie, and translated him as more of a wimp than anything else.Overall, Kenzari would've been much more suited for some other character in the film rather than Jafar, and Jafar himself should've been played by someone much older compared to Kenzari. The person that I, along with my mother and some friends of mine, thought would've fit the part of Jafar like a glove was Ben Kingsley. I know, he's white, but considering he has such as large versatility as an actor, and that he can successfully play any role he's given, Kingsley would have been a much better choice for the part of Jafar.The next subject will be on the film's story, made by Guy Ritchie and John August, as well as the direction by the former. I will say that while they weren't able to measure up to the awesomeness of of the original, the two of them were still able to make the film great in its own right.I get the point, Guy Ritchie is obviously quite the odd choice to some as director of this movie, but...I thought that he was perfect for the job, and that's partly coming from a guy who's a big fan of his work in the Sherlock Holmes film starring Robert Downey Jr. (which I likewise apologize for not reviewing yet, but hope too soon). The chase and action moments were astonishingly some of the film's best moments.The story and screenplay by Ritchie and John August was quite an eventful one, with lots of surprises to boot. It was a definite balance of both familiar and new, in that while the concept was pretty much like the animated film, there were still things about it that made the film its own thing. Examples of that include the dance scene between Aladdin and Jasmine, which wasn't in the original at all.The only thing I wasn't completely fond of concerning the story and direction was that the recreations of scenes from the original, such as the introduction to the Cave of Wonders, were too quick-paced. They needed some fleshing out, and didn't have enough time to really breathe. I know, they obviously didn't want the film to be too long, but still.Likewise, the film had some pretty solid humor here and there. The best jokes in the film, especially, come from that of the Genie and Dalia. For instance, in the dance scene, when Aladdin had no idea how to dance, I couldn't help but find the part where Genie was using his magic to make Aladdin do all those dance moves to be hysterical!Admittedly, the CGI in the film certainly wasn't the best, but...it was still pretty good. The effects used with the animals were certainly great. Rajah the Tiger, Abu the Capuchin Monkey, and Iago the Scarlet Macaw (voiced by Alan Tudyk, and whose character is a regular parrot in contrast to Gilbert Gottfried's character) literally seemed like real animals. The motion capture effects used with the genie forms of Genie and Jafar were all delightfully spot-on too.I must say that out of all of them, though, I was incredibly astounded by the CGI used with the magic carpet. I didn't think it'd be possible to have the use of him in CGI match up to his animated counterpart, but, the effects team successfully did it. My Mom, grandmother, and I could barely comprehend how they did it and if the character was even a real carpet or not.My final noting, just like my review on the animated film, will be on the music that the movie had, done by true Disney musical genius, Alan Menken.Menken's work in this film was astounding! That's not to say it's even better than the original's music, but still...he killed it!I love how he was able to really extend himself for this feature, giving the music a noticeably new Arabian and Middle-Eastern feeling that was wonderful for this live-action update. The songs in this version, old and new, were enormously catchy and enjoyable to listen to, bringing in faithfulness to the original soundtrack, but at the same time, bringing a flair of its own, something that the soundtrack from the 2017 Beauty and the Beast film particularly lacked (exceptions from the latter film being ""Days in the Sun"" and ""Evermore"").A special credit that I'd like to give in terms of the lyrics goes to the fact that much of Tim Rice's and the late Howard Ashman's work was kept, as well as towards Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (both of whom wrote the songs for ""The Greatest Showman"") for adding in their own brilliant creativity. The best ones, in my opinion, that were sung by the surprisingly amazing singing chops of Massoud, Scott, and Smith, were ""One Jump Ahead"", ""Friend Like Me"", ""Prince Ali"", and ""Speechless"". The music video version of ""Speechless"" was what I thought to be the best version of the latter song.In the end, while the live-action Aladdin certainly won't topple the 1992 animated classic in terms of sheer awesomeness due to Kenzari's casting and performance as Jafar, and many of the recreated scenes being too quick, it's still an excellent film in its own right thanks to the music, smart direction and storytelling, CGI, and terrific casting and performances by Massoud, Scott, Pedrid, and Smith, the latter whose performance and comedic-chops would make Robin Williams extremely proud. It was a great way to pay homage to the late Williams and Ashman despite the setbacks I mentioned.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

You better rub me the right way.,"This really felt like a hiding to nothing. A largely unnecessary remake of a classic animated feature, full of classic songs and featuring a paramount performance from Robin Williams. Add to this that Guy Ritchie's recent run of films has not been good, and the shaky images of Will Smith as the Genie that were released a few months bank and it felt like a recipe for disaster. But ... I'm happy report that though not without flaws, I enjoyed ""Aladdin"" a lot.Aladdin (Mena Massaud) is a thief surviving on the streets of Agrabah with just his wits. The Sultan's advisor Jafar (Marwen Kenzari) sends Aladdin to the cave of wonders, to retrieve for him a magic lamp. However, Aladdin becomes trapped and once accidentally rubbing the lamp himself frees a magical Genie (Will Smith) who grants Aladdin three wishes.There is lots to love about ""Aladdin"". The production is great, with Agrabah feeling like a real city. The effects are actually pretty good too, the single still of the Genie didn't do it any favours but as in the animated film, he's constantly changing size and shape, particularly during the musical numbers, and for much of the film he pretends to be a regular human too, so loses the blue altogether. The cast area really good, and there's a nice chemistry between Massaud and Naomi Scott, who plays Princess Jasmine. Though rewriting the Genie's style of humour helps a lot, Smith doesn't really come close to catching Robin Williams version of the character, and the songs style don't suit him either. (I winced a little at the start of a couple of the genies numbers).If, for whatever reason, you're only allowed to see one version of ""Aladdin"", the animated version is still the way to go, however, as a companion piece or curiosity, there is much to admire in this version.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

A Solid Live-Action Remake,"From Maleficent to Alice in Wonderland, even though those are films that have been changed the most from their original versions, it really does feel like Disney has now doubled-down on keeping their remakes familiar, down to replicating shots and songs. Many viewers may take offence to this or find it pointless to even watch a remake that doesn't take any creative liberties, but I feel that an updated version for today's kids isn't all that bad. Aladdin is one of the latest films to receive this treatment and I believe it's also one of the better ones they've done.Following Aladdin (Mena Massoud), a street thief who finds his way into the palace of Princess Jasmine (Noami Scott), eventually stumbles across a lamp that reveals a genie (Will Smith) who will grant him three wishes. The core premise of the original film is very much present here, but there are also a few welcome additions that don't feel forced or disappointing, at least in my opinion. Viewers seem to be complaining about the villain in Jafar (Marwan Kenzari) for being too soft-spoken and not threatening enough, but I thought this take on him felt very refreshing and more sly than overpowering.Like most of these remakes, there are many shots that just feel like replicas of the classic animated film and the songs are exactly the same for the most part, but for me, it all came down to how everything seems to jump off the screen and if I was able to buy into it all. The short answer for that is yes, I found myself invested in everything that was going on and Mena Massoud, Naomi Scott, and especially Will Smith all deliver great performances. Will Smith doesn't ruin what Robin Williams did in the past, but rather makes it his own and I really appreciated that.Where this films biggest issue lies; However, is in its runtime. This version of Aladdin is nearly 40 minutes longer than the original film and while many of the scenes do add to the movie as a whole, it does feel its length at times. There are many fun aspects to this movie, so when a lot of time is taken to explore the dramatic side of these characters, it almost slows down to a halt at times. Luckily, the cast and story surrounding them are so likeable that I was able to forgive a few slow scenes, for the most part.In the end, this 2019 live-action version of Aladdin could have been better and should've probably changed the original premise a little more than it did, in order to feel fresher, but I really enjoyed what was shown to me. This is the same way I have felt about most of these remakes, where if you loved, or even liked the original animated movie, then there's really no reason why you shouldn't at least enjoy watching it at the very least. It has its issues, but I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the movies watching Aladdin.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
We Miss Robin Williams,"Aladdin debuted in 1992 to great fanfare mainly because it was revealed that Robin Williams would portray the Genie. The role was tailor-made for him. The comedic genius that was Robin Williams not only embodied the Genie, but his performance was so worldly that the Golden Globes created an award for him.We fast forward to 2019, and a new live-action version of Aladdin is released. This movie wasn't exactly receiving the positive anticipation of the 1992 version. The trailer of a very blue Will Smith as the Genie certainly didn't help matters.Aladdin the 2019 live-action version isn't horrible. A couple of things to keep in mind to give this live-action version a fair shot doesn't compare it to the 1992 version. Second, keep in mind that Robin Williams was a comedic genius and that Will Smith could never duplicate that performance. If you accept one and two, then you're in for a fun time.Things I loved about this new version is that they cast actors of middle eastern/Indian descent. Mena Massoud is charming as Aladdin. Naomi Scott is a powerhouse to contend with as Princess Jasmine. Her voice is out of this world. Her and Mena have a natural chemistry. Marwan Kenzari as Jarfar was one of the new changes to this version of Aladdin. He is younger, more attractive, and not as mean. One can't fault Kenzari for that, but I was expecting more darkness. Navid Negahban portrays The Sultan. This time around, he's more serious, and I wish they would have kept some of the humor. Naims Pedrad as Dalia provides the comic relief that missing at times. She is the perfect wing woman to Princess Jasmine. The role of Hakim also has been upgraded and is nicely played by Nusman Acar.I purposely saved Will Smith as the Genie for last. The smartest thing Will did upon accepting this role is to carve out a new identity for him. He created a Genie that infuses his strength. Will Smith is charismatic and funny in real life. Those are the traits mainly featured in this Genie. I also liked that he stayed in his musical zone. It's not that he's a lousy singer, but it's merely not his strength. He also infused his hip-hop background into the musical portions; this makes his singing more enjoyable. I still feel that the blue coloring makes the Genie look second rate. The effects aren't flattering.I wish they incorporated more of the Bollywood style throughout the movie not just in the musical numbers. Speaking of the music, Speechless is a new song that was added and is beautifully sung by Naomi Scott. Alan Menken collaborated with Benji Pasek and Justin Paul for this new song. Menken also updated the score to reflect the scenery displayed in this movie. Even some of the lyrics in the songs were updated to reflect today's environment.Is the live action version of Aladdin a home run? No, but it's also not horrible. This movie will introduce a whole new generation to Aladdin while helping an older generation reminisce. The songs are still catchy, and you will find yourself singing along. Aladdin is not excellent, but it's a solid effort by all involved, including Guy Ritchie.Diversity: This movie receives a 7 for diversity. All the major characters were portrayed by people of color. I wish more of the extras were of middle eastern/Indian decent.Scale: This movie gets a 7 for sheer fun",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
"Dead eyed, wooden, monotone'd debacle","I tried SO hard to enjoy this, I was actually looking forward to it for quite some time. However, let's face facts, only a few cast members could almost-kind of-sing, there were a lot of awkward sounding songs that assaulted my ears, which made for an uncomfortable viewing.The acting, possibly the worst I have ever seen in a high budget movie, again, only a handful of cast members seemed semi-capable, but most were awful, line's being delivered with no emotion or believability. A personal favorite of terrible acting was Jafar, the blank stare he constantly pushed in an attempt to come across as the bad guy, combined with his utter lack of ability to deliver lines that fit the script was shockingly bad.And the editing, very choppy, sloppily thrown together scenes that felt rushed and only put in there because it happened in the original movie, it felt as though Guy Ritchie wanted to make an entirely different movie but had to do this at gun point.Honestly, I'm a nobody talentless hack, yet I would have done a better job if I directed and played every single role in this film.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

A-Lame-In nostalgic cashgrab,"The original Aladdin is still one of my all-time favourite Disney movies. Everything about it is so much fun to watch. The animation, the music, the comedy, the story, the atmosphere. After seeing the Live-Action Disney remake, I have to say it was mostly lame in comparison. The atmosphere in this one felt like a TV movie for large chunks of it and despite the colours, everything still looked bland and cheap. Aladdin and Jasmine have no chemistry together in this and their acting is pretty bad, and Jafar is now very bland and just a stock villain badguy with very little personality or wit to him. The only character that is passable surprisingly is the Genie, where Will Smith faired better than I initially expected. The closest I got to laughing or finding myself entertained in the movie was whenever he was on screen. I can definitely confidently say Will Smith was the best thing going for the Aladdin remake.For the most part, Aladdin is basically the same as the original. There are a few little changes here and there and some plot filler stuff that doesn't really go anywhere. If you've seen Beauty and the Beast it's similar to that. The classic songs are not performed nearly as well, and the new ones are pretty forgettable. The CGI can range from fine to laughable, and it's not really done in any memorable way. The score is decent but that's because it relies mostly on the original. The movie is not really shot in any special way, it just feels conventional and nothing about it screams like it's a Guy Ritchie film at all. Just another passable/mediocre Live Action Disney remake movie at best. Why did it need to be 2 hours long I have no idea, but the movie was weak and Will Smith is really the only thing going for it, despite Robin Williams still being far superior in the original. Overall, another ""Bleh"" Live-Action Disney remake we didn't need at all. Stick with the original Aladdin that has superior effects, acting, jokes, atmosphere, characters, and depth over this nostalgic cashgrab.4/10",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Disappointed,"The movie was uploaded onto a pirate site, so I watched it. I was disappointed because it's already been done. What is the point of taking an old tale and making a movie that is almost scene for scene and word for word like the cartoon, including the songs? It completely lacked originality and I got bored watching it and fast forwarded it to the end.The only positive decisions they made was to actually use actors of eastern ethnicity and that was a highlight for their talents, and they gave the genie a better ending. The capuchin monkey was sweet as well.Now the original story was far more exciting and adventurous; I remember reading it in an old old book when I was a child. If they're going to use humans to tell the tale - do it properly by respecting the culture and the history of their story telling. Stop disneyfying everything; it's getting old.

Make way for the Fresh Prince; Disney ain't ever had a friend like him.,"When discussing Guy Ritchie's 'Aladdin' remake, it's impossible not to get caught up on the fact that it's exactly that: a remake. This new wave of live action Disney do-overs is pretty harmful to the filmmaking industry, as the majority of them (including this) have been enormously successful at the box-office, telling behemoths like Disney that this is what audiences want. It isn't. Or at least it shouldn't be. I'd much rather watch the original 'Aladdin' (1992) and have something new to see at the cinema than have to watch every classic again in an inferior way. Thankfully, though, this version of the flick is nowhere near as bad as it could have been. It's pointless, yes, but it's here and I have to admit it's a fairly entertaining time. The first portion moves rather slowly and it's not all that enjoyable, but things really take a turn for the better upon the arrival of Will Smith's Genie. Somehow the aspect of the piece that people were most worried about is the best thing about it. He's an entertaining character and Smith really brings him to life in a satisfying way. The relationship between Aladdin and the Genie is well realised here, too, and the middle portion of the film is actually rather fun. Naomi Scott is a good choice for Jasmine, as well, and she works well together with Mena Massoud, even if the script doesn't develop their relationship all too well. Surprisingly, the musical numbers are also pretty good. While the visuals are often copied straight from the original film, the actual music is enjoyable. Despite them all, bar one which is good if a little too pop-sounding, being taken from the original, they manage to sound fresh thanks to the cast - especially Smith. The updated versions stand on their own and Smith's style fits them surprisingly well, meaning that whenever there's a song, it's a fun time - something really important considering that this is a musical. It doesn't just remind you of how good the songs in the original were either, it actually makes you like and remember these new versions. It's not all good though; the film is far too long. Somehow they managed to take the exact same story that took 90 minutes and tell it in 128, and you can feel it. Also, while it is entertaining to an extent, there have been far more enjoyable family films this year that are a lot more original than this. Overall, it's a decent, if overlong, watch that can actually be fairly enjoyable. Like I said though, it's never outstanding and it's originality is severely lacking. Without Smith, this wouldn't have been anywhere near as successful. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

It's pure magic,"Aladdin - if it's a Disney movie, there must be magic and Aladdin is no exception. Comparisons with the animation film are perhaps inevitable, but I would advise you to leave that baggage behind when you immerse yourself into this superlative experience. Replete with colour, VFX, high octane action and mounted on a lavish scale, this larger than life reproduction of the Arabian Nights tale directed by Guy Ritchie contain slight departure from the original story. But that only ensures that the narrative remains taut, crisp and concise.The production values and glossy output are a treat to the eyes, albeit it's an all-American venture. Please don't try to look for the aesthetics or originality of the Arab culture as you are then likely to be disappointed. Aladdin is a pure commercial entertainer and let's take that at its face value instead of getting lost in the cultural or artistic debate.The sets are jaw dropping. Shot largely in Wadi Rum (Jordan), the desert looks majestic. The palace, bazaars, local people complement the build of the story, which gets going from the very beginning and there's never a dull moment. Will Smith as the Genie is absolutely cracking - high energy, infectious in charm and his usual comic timing are all packaged into this tailor made role for him. Mena Massoud in the titular role is impressive too. I only thought that newbie Naomi Scott playing Princess Jasmine was far too Western for the role and has made no effort to adopt the Arabic accent or traits. Nevertheless, her chemistry with Mena Massoud is fantastic, offering a wave of freshness to the screen. Aladdin will be endearing to viewers of all ages, please don't write it off as a children's film. Go for it!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
"A ""miss"" in the hit & miss game of live action Disney","When Disney pulled off Beauty and the Beast (a film with several essential characters being singing, dancing housewares) my skepticism fell to the anticipation of enjoying much loved Disney films anew. Unfortunately, that skepticism's resurrection came in the form of live action Aladdin.
As others have noted, the acting leaves much to be desired & the music is ""over produced"" to the gills, but allow me to bite those and move on to another.
As we know, Aladdin involves a flying carpet, a magical genie, a highly skilled monkey, an empathetic tiger, and a malicious trained parrot. However, this film constantly attempts to explain, through back stories or forced dialogue, things most of us didn't puzzle over in the original. Part of the reason people often feel books are better than their film adaptions is that a book leaves room for imagination. That said, if the animated Aladdin were a book, the live action is it's movie. Forced explanations of the mundane abound & whether they contradict what you'd assumed or compliment, they feel superfluous regardless.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Lost a bit of magic but i still enjoyable.,"So i sat down to watch this movie with a friend. I loved the original animated version as a kid. Genie was always super fun and made a lot of magic happen. Will Smith as genie was a good cast. He is a great actor. The only thing that was missing was a bit of the magic. I felt the original genie had a bit more POW and FIZZ. And was a bit more like clowny? But you gotta remember that the original was a animated movie made for kids, which of cause gives a lot more freedom to do that sort of thing more easily. But Will Smith still made it work. And he made the songs into his own. Aladdin and Yasmin and the sultan was very good in their roles. They looked right and did a fine job acting. Carpet and Abu was good too. Where i felt it was missing a bit was with Jaffar and Iago. It was like they wherent evil enough, there was not enough battle between Aladdin and Jaffar. And Iago actually being just a parrot without the real ability to talk normally was also a bit of a let down. But the scenery and colors and setting was very well made.

Beautiful but Empty,"This movie seemed to me well made but so empty. Visually it looks very decent with all choreography's and cgi BUT the story ,the script, the flow I could say its all so predictable and weakly worked out

Will smith is holding to his character and keeps this film moving forward, without Will I don't think that this film would get me even to cinema,,,,

Not good,"While I was willing to watch this movie once it's not a movie I would ever waste my time watching again. Mediocre CGI, acting, singing and story.

Go and make up your own mind,"I think people are a little too attached to the original 92 film and I get it! In saying that, I love the fact that all these Disney stories are being recreated as live action. It's a new take on nostalgia. I'm the type of person that secretly watches cartoons, animated movies, plays video games from my childhood (really need to find an Atari now that I think of that...), anyway I love taking trips down memory lane so if anyone should be hesitant to see a remake, it's me! This movie did not disappoint at all. It pays homage to the original in more ways than one. Does it feel like a 2 hour film? Nope. It keeps you engaged from start to finish. The cinematography is brilliant however a little too much CGI perhaps. Will Smith does a good job of playing the genie despite a few ""cringey"" moments. I guess I'm just not used to seeing Smith in a Disney musical film. Overall an enjoyable movie that everyone will love if you like reliving your childhood in a modern way.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
A Dumpster-Fire,"Box office results dictate that we will be stuck with Disney's remorseless plundering of its own back-catalogue for a while to come now, and while remakes can sometimes eclipse their original counterparts, the House of Mouse's efforts so far have fallen way short of the mark. And now this!On paper this could sound passable, if you were to read only the most basic of post-it-fitting summaries. The story has potential, and there are a million ways to do it right, but remember, that's not what this is about. Oh no. The constraints are suffocating: you need to adhere as closely as possible to the animated inspiration, maintain the song and music format, hit as wide a demographic as possible, yet also pad tings out to match modern blockbuster runtime expectations. Okay then...Since the source's appeal flowed largely from a central performance, it logically followed that Disney would want to re-create that as best it could... BUT they needed someone with real-life charisma, box-office appeal, minimal singing and dancing qualifications and character. Since the inimitable Robin Williams was a bit resentful of how Disney overstepped their rights on Aladdin and is also very dead, they went with obvious replacement... Will Smith?I care nothing for Smith's beliefs or horrendous nepotism. The guy has incredible charm, and yes, he can act. But his energy is very different from Williams. It is laid back and ironic, not manic and over-the-top. Instead of adapting proceedings to his own type of charisma and humor, the filmmakers shoehorn him into a gaping Williams-shaped hole, and try as you might, you can never forget the extent to which the role was meant for - and in great part co-designed by - someone so different. The quality of Smith's blue CGI makeup is an abomination but it is kept to a minimum, and sadly, is not what truly sinks the film. It's the constant reminder of how wrong Smith is for the part as maintained by Disney, and watching him rap over Friend Like Me will make you feel sorry for the guy.Speaking of casting, the demands of finding minority actors who can appeal to mainstream American audiences AND carry a blockbuster AND sing clearly proved to much for the studio (never a problem for an animated film where you can easily cheat your way past such constraints), and it's a shame, because in the moments between doing covers of famous songs and reciting inane dialogue, Mena Massoud is rather wonderful. Other choices mostly miss the mark, with Naomi Scott being completely flavorless and burdened with a useless subplot and Marwan Kenzari giving us a ridiculously young and neutered Jafar.Other reviewers have commented on the cheap-looking visuals, and it often felt like characters were walking through the Magic Kingdom. Director Guy Ritchie brings absolutely no personality to the proceedings, and anyone involved in ""adapting"" the script for this ought to be ashamed of themselves.No amount of nostalgia can save this train-wreck, and watching it I either felt embarrassed for the participants or yearning for the original. The only hope it raised was that of the perverse enjoyment some of us might soon experience at watching Disney completely butcher Lady and the Tramp.Please, find another - ANY OTHER - use for your time and money!",1.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Disney x Bollywood-style = Aladdin,"The movie looks like a cross pollination between Disney's magic with Bollywood's colorful musicals, especially the costumes and dancing.Like Beauty & the Beast before, it hews very close to the animation movie with only tiny deviations.Enjoyable for a one time watch, but the cheese can become quite thick.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

My eyes rolled when I saw the review score,"I played the video games in the 90s and watched the original multiple times. Having come out if the cinema, I was shocked to see the review score. In my opinion I rate this 8/10 because it brought back so many good memories.Let's start with the negatives. The bits where this is let down are mainly the ""street"" scenes. They could have shot it in multiple countries to give it an authentic vibe, but instead opted for a set and you can tell. At times it looks like they're walking around Disneyland rather than real streets. I also felt it was a bit slow to get going. I'm not complaining about the music, the original had maybe 8/9 songs in it, so this is a music based film so expect that if you haven't seen the original or can't remember it.Now the positives. Thought Aladdin, Jasmine and Genie were excellent and the handmaiden. It also had a beautiful ending, really rounded that off well. Overall I thought the shooting of the film was great, it was just the opening scenes I wasn't keen on. The live action such as the magic carpet added some light entertainment.At the end of the day, this is a kids film and from what I could see in the cinema, the younger crowd loved it. Kids dancing to all the songs etc. If you're expecting something like LaLaLand then you'll be disappointed. It's a great kids film, which nostalgic adults can actually enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Tolerable changes,"I was able to get past the mediocre singing because I thought the characters were cast rather well. I really enjoyed Will Smith as the genie and how he made the character his own. Extra songs, some scene changes, and a plot difference. They didn't detract from the story, so I wasn't disappointed. A Whole New World was make or break, and I was happy with how they did it.

Poor and unnecessary remake,"I'll start by trying to review this like a stand alone film as opposed to a remake. There are a a few aspects of this film which are good, which is that the story and the songs are well written, and the setting is great, but of course this is no surprise. Sadly it doesn't shine through in all areas, most notably for the very poor CGI, as well as poor acting by most of the cast, especially from Mena Massoud who plays Aladdin. Now had this been an original release I would give this a 6/10, it's a distinctly average movie, good songs and story but with jokes that fall very flat, some poor acting and CGI.The reality is however that this is a remake, a remake of a very accomplished film, and so this is where I have mixed feelings. Anyone who has watched the original and had the chance to fully appreciate it before watching the remake can see that the casting in this movie is undeniably very bad. Aladdin lacks the charm and charisma which defined the original character, Jasmin lacks that distinct kind of fiery character of the original, Jafar has become this very generic bad guy, again nothing like the original, and as for the Genie, well Will Smith was just never gonna come close to the incredible performance of Robin Williams. The casting in this remake is just all wrong, and I find it quite disappointing. Honestly I don't think there really was a need to remake this movie in the first place as the original is still fantastic. Ultimately this version is easily good enough to entertain children, so sure you can take your kids to the cinema to watch it and they'll love it no doubt. But what irks me is that the next generation kids are gonna grow up watching this shoddy remake which is just a mere shadow of it's predecessor, and that the pure class of the original may no longer be appreciated by many.I do wish Disney would stop doing this as it's killing the classics. At least if you're gonna go through the effort to remake a classic then cast the right actors for the part and don't skimp on the CGI, otherwise what's the point other than to just money grab at the box office, it's just greed and a lack of original ideas which is killing cinema, and it's for this reason I have to lower my rating because I just can't advocate this garbage. If you want to enjoy the story of Aladdin, watch the original as it's far superior in every single way and if possible try to even find a classic cinema that can play the original if you want to take your kids to see it for the first time.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

They shouldn't have remade it,"Overall I felt this was a cheap ripoff of the original 1992 Aladdin film. The film had no creativity at all as it added nothing new to the Aladdin franchise and this poor remake actually had less content and worse acting than the original. This film had dialogue and acting, I think those three things contribute to 90% of how good a film is, the other 10% is of course the relatively meaningless characters and story. My other criticisms is this movie lacked diversity and wasn't politically correct enough. The special effects was probably the best part of this film, the special effects left me swooning and they felt out of this world. Overall I don't think people should bother with this film and if they want to see Aladdin they should see the 1992 version.",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Don't listen to the critics!!,This rendition of Aladdin was incredible. Will Smith steals the show not by trying to be Robin Williams but by doing a genie that is equally as good in his own way.

Don't waste your money on this grabage,"I should've learned from my mistakes when I went to a couple of previous Disney remakes that I attended but thought to give this a shot and again I was wrong, As far as I can see it, Disney is either ran out of ideas or ran out of people who can think,I guess that's why they keep acquiring big names and companies like fox, star wars, marvel...etc.for years now they only offer remakes or sequels in the most part, Nothing fresh!

Poor Nostalgia,"Disney has been making their previous 2D films to live action films and Aladdin is one of them. The live action Aladdin is just a copy of the 2D film, i.e. there is no new themes added to the story, except for some frivolous details. The film's magic is not close at all to the original and shows how some movies cannot be easily adapted to live action. Aladdin had a cast that was very disappointing except for some like Mena Massoud. He was charming and funny in the film, I would also say Will Smith was casted well as genie, he was zany but showed a sensitive side like in the original. Nasim Pedrad was quite a good addition though I feel her potential was not at all used to full extend. Actors like Naomi Scott tried their best but it all felt staged, Naomi does not look at all ethinic and right for the time,but the brunt of the movie was undoubtedly Jafar, played by Marwan Kenzari. The British accent and not at all charming or wicked face just made me want to watch the original. The setting was very well done and the dances was choreographed very well. However, the transitions to the next scenes was so poorly done. I wish Guy Ritchie studied more about the culture because middle eastern culture is very fascination and the movie did not showcase it. history and Now the songs were well sung and I like all of them except speechless it felt like very stupid addition. It felt like the movie was trying to scream that Jasmine was a strong independent woman, also the tune was not memorable for me.My favorite part of the movie is when the genie sings ""A friend like me"", it was super entertaining.

The problem is that the casting of Jasmine was wrong and I wish they used a more ethnic Arabic actress. The genie ( Will Smith) was actually well casted, he was zany and emotional like in the original. The villain (Jafar) played by Marwan Kenzari is what made the movie not good. Jafar was forgetful in this movie. Marwan did not study Jafar very well and he felt very one-dimensional. The editing was not perfect either. It shows that Guy Ritchie (director) has not studied musicals very well.

"Beautiful, stunning, and a well made adaptation of the original.","Aladdin (4 out of 5 stars).Aladdin is a beautiful wonderful musical fantasy film that brings the animated classic movie to life. Which director Guy Ritchie does really well in being faithful to the original movie. From similar musical sequences to very much the same story. Sure, there will be some new changes and additions like Will Smith's Genie telling a narrative story in the beginning of the movie. And some new characters like Jasmines Handmaiden, and some new original songs sang by Naomi Scott. Otherwise, fans of the original will love. I know some may find it difficult to accept Will Smith playing Genie. After beloved Robin Williams is so great as the character. Will Smith was fantastic as the character. Brought his fun, outgoing charms, and the musical sequence were great. Will Smith was the perfect choice. Mena Massoud as Aladdin was also good as well. He delivered the charms of a thief, trying to feed the poor, and falling for a princess. Naomi Scott was also good as well. She is beautiful and great as the character. Marwan Kenzari was good as Jafar. A villain that wants power.Guy Ritchie's direction is one of his better films. The film feels like an adventurous kind of movie feeling similar to The Mummy. With the opening credits sequence of the city and the desert landscape of a monstrous cave. The film does have some fun action sequences and chases with Aladdin. The story is similar to the original so don't expect anything new. The musical sequences are also fun and great as well. The best one with Whole New World song sang by Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott were also great. There is also plenty of humor with Aladdin being awkward in talking to the princess. And Genie being his mentor in trying to teach him. The visual effects is also great as well.I will say the movie did feel a little too long with the run time. Feel like the editors can trim the film a little in trying to make it a better pace with the movie. There were some slow moments that dragged on a little.Overall, Aladdin is a good fantasy musical film. The cast did great.

"Better than I expected, and a worthy 'reboot'","Honestly, I wasn't expecting much going into the theater and only purchased the movie tickets because nothing else better was playing at the time (earlier today), especially after the utter disappointment of the last two Disney musicals I've watched, including ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Mary Poppins Returns"". Also, I felt it would be rather difficult or (let alone) even match the charm and magic of the original 90's animation. That was certainly a Disney classic, and during the peak of their earlier hay-days. But, I was quite pleased with the direction and musical quality of this reboot/remake of ""Aladdin"", featuring Will Smith as the Genie. At some points, the acting was either too weak or overdone, but nothing deal-breaking at all. Also, the camera work and flying scenes made me feel much more excited than the animated film from the early 90's. That, in itself, was a major accomplishment, making the viewer (in this case, me) feel a genuine sense of flying. My only complaint would be the very obvious additions/changes to the ending, creating a slightly feminist tone to the theme of the movie. I didn't feel like this change was anything necessary and the director/producer should've stayed true to the original ending, yet I respect their effort in trying to change the attitudes towards male/female gender roles in movies. Having said all of that, ""Aladdin"" had a few faults and minor disappointments, but was (still) a lot of fun and I loved the musical quality from beginning to end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Very good,"Aladdin is a 2019 American fantasy and romance musical film directed by Guy Ritchie and written by Ritchie in collaboration with John August and Vanessa Taylor. It is the live-action remake of the 1992 animated short film Aladdin. Arabic The Arabian Nights and the French version of Antoine Galland. Produced by Walt Disney Pictures, Rideback, Vertigo Entertainment, Big Talk Films and Marc Platt Productions and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, stars Mena Massoud, Naomi Scott, Will Smith, Marwan Kenzari, Navid Negahban, Nasim Pedrad, Billy Magnussen. and Numan Acar. Alladin is a young thief living on petty thefts in Agrabah. One day, he helps a young woman retrieve a valuable bracelet, unaware that she is actually Princess Jasmine. Alladin soon becomes interested in her, who claims to be the princess's maid. Visiting her in the palace and discovering her identity, he is captured by Jafar, the sultat's grand vizier, who wants him to retrieve a magic lamp, where he inhabits a genius capable of granting three wishes to its owner. Simply magnificent movie, breathtaking special effects, musical was very good, chose the actors very well! Will Smith plays the genius with style of his character Will Smith of the series A Madman in the Piece, Daniel Garcia drag queen who voices the Alladin followed the original script went down very well.

"Pointless, full of cliches","First of all - Will Smith really did try. And his part is the best in the movie. But the directing... It's hard to imagine, that something could be directed THAT bad nowdays. Apart from cgi effects, the movie is a bunch of cliches, it's been done before. The story itself is such a brilliant space for imagination, but not for this live version - predictable and boring is the accurate synonym to this.
I tried to give a chance to the cast, but it's hard - there's no chemistry between the characters, and the worst thing - their faces are forgetable.

Good film but with a despicable ending,"I only remember having one problem with the film. Which made me deduct a few points.Despicable ridiculous stupid forced feminism ending. Let me lay some facts i might educate the haters.In history. In history there were no woman sultan ever!-the title sultan is restricted to muslim countries cuz the the title carries religious significance. (Cant be a woman cuz of the religious rightfully restriction that all good muslims understand and satisfied with. and dont want to change ever)the term is distinct from king (not queen).-sultan to muslim countries is also a name for a man. U cant possibly name a woman sultan. Its like calling a woman jeff.And Dont u dare say the queen of england! I have nothing against the queen. But shes a queen not a sultan. In history there were queens i get that.
Also In history the term sultana is feminine word for sultan. But the word sultana is used for the Sultan wifes or daughters. It doesn't contain The same exact meaning.In the film i might have accepted if they used sultana but noooo. Shes the sultan. Dont make me laugh.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Worst Disney live action remake to date,"The Disney live action remakes typically get a ton of hate. I personally really loved The Jungle Book, Beauty and the Beast and Christopher Robin. They take the beloved source material and build upon it to create a movie with more depth and atmosphere. Aladdin somehow gets everything so wrong.Bad casting, horrible CGI and poor decisions from director Guy Ritchie all around. I honestly don't think the could have casted worst people for the roles of Aladdin, Mad at and Genie. Naomi Scott on the other hand carries this entire film! Her portrayal as Jasmine breathes life into this hollow remake. The new original song will blow you away. Her voice nails the songs we all know and love. Will Smith seems lazy and uneager to fill the shoes of Robin Williams. While Friend Like Me was somewhat enjoyable Prince Ali couldn't be more dull. How Disney butchered this fun and iconic song I'll never know. Could have hired ANYONE else and use the money you saved not bringing on Will Smith and invest in into the CGI. The CGI is the worst you'll see in theaters in this modern age. Disney shouldnt have skimped out on that front, especially for a remake of one of their most popular movies ever. Mena Massoud was a horrendous Aladdin. This loveable and optimistic character is so lifeless. His personality was as closed off as his nips.How did they get all this so wrong? Please don't waste your money on this even if you're curious to see how this turned out.

Lots of spectacle but little magic,"Am a huge Disney fan and have been for pretty much my whole life, 'Cinderella', 'Peter Pan' and 'The Lion King' being my first Disney films (still love all three, especially 'The Lion King'). 'Aladdin' is one of my favourites from them as well as being one of my favourite animated and even overall films. Great animation, songs, characters and one of Disney's best voice acting performances ever in Robin Williams. Will admit to not being overly excited hearing that there was going to be a live-action remake and was a bit mixed on the trailer.Have nothing against remakes, or at least try not to, and have liked a few of Disney's previous live-action remakes. The best being 'The Jungle Book' and 'Cinderella'. Will Smith when he has good material is a likeable actor and still have fond memories of watching 'The Fresh Prince of Bel Air' when younger. Although not a fan of Guy Ritchie, there is no bias against him either. Decided to see 'Aladdin' with mixed expectations, due to being such a big fan of Disney and after hearing from a few friends that it was good.Do sadly have to agree with those that were disappointed and this is even when judging 'Aladdin' (2019) on its own merits. There is a lot of spectacle and most of it is great, but the magic and soul were missing. Again, like as was said for the recent version of 'The Lion King', there has always been an effort to not excessively compare and judge something on its own, but when one version is so great and another fails badly in comparison it is hard not to.There are good things with 'Aladdin'. Although very Bollywood-ish (am not saying that as a bad thing, just an observation), the costumes and sets are big, colourful and quite lavish. Some of the photography dazzles. The music that still has the involvement of Alan Menken, songs and score (the music being one of the main reasons as to why the animation is the classic that it is), is a sheer delight. The likes of ""Friend Like Me"" and ""A Whole New World"" being classics. Here the older songs are re-worked and there are a couple of new ones, complete with some equally dynamic new scoring. ""Friend Like Me"" and ""A Whole New World"" are very nicely done, and also really liked the more ambitious re-working of ""Arabian Nights"" and ""Speechless"" (the better of the two added songs) adds such a lot to Jasmine's character.Really liked what was done with Jasmine's character, who is by far the most interesting and most developed character in the film and her development is richer than in the animated films. The performances were mixed, with Naomi Scott sparkling like a true diamond as Jasmine and Will Smith makes a very game and spirited effort filling giant shoes and brings a lot of charisma and freshness to Genie. Mena Massoud isn't as strong but is appealing as Aladdin.However, Guy Ritchie came over as the wrong director. Did think even hearing about it that he was a strange and potentially disastrous choice for the job and his style just doesn't gel and was in serious need of more subtlety. There is some dazzling photography but too much of it is a bit too overblown and gimmicky. The film could have done with having fewer special effects and they tend to not be all that great, felt even from the trailer that Genie looked weird and my feelings haven't changed. The script could have done with more freshness.For me too the story was in need of more charm, energy and soul. It doesn't quite suffer as badly as 'The Lion King' from being too faithful and not having enough of its own identity, but what comes over faithfully does not have the same impact or feel anywhere near as fresh. The additional content mostly doesn't add as much as ought and bloats the film, which could have been 15 minutes shorter (which was a fairly similar problem too with 'Beauty and the Beast'). Marwan Kenzari is a complete non-entity as a pretty one-note Jafar, whose back-story was laudable on paper but wasn't particularly compelling somehow. Abu, Iago and Rajah don't make anywhere near the same impression either, though Abu has his moments (helps too that Frank Welker is back, Iago however sounded odd without Gilbert Gottfried who voiced the character for the original and its two sequels and the television show).On the whole, lacklustre but has its moments. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
Fantastically entertaining,"I want to compare it to the cartoon of 92 a bit. The cartoon almost felt claustrophobic compared to this movie. The characters all have distinct traits and almost all of them made me laugh at one or more points during the movie.I can't remember the last time a movie made me laugh out loud and watch it again with amazement. I really don't understand what the other reviewers talk about. This movie is a 10 out of 10 for me.The dancing, music, characters and their development is just truly well done. The singing is good, so good you want to sing along.The instigating parrot Ioago and hearing his voice in between the characters is so funny, you rewind back to hear it again.I enjoyed the movie and have watched it 4 times already.Watch it, you won't be disappointed.

Not as good as the original.,"The live action Aladdin isn't as good as its original animated counterpart, but it didn't have to.

In the end, this Aladdin is good enough to please those who love the original, but not nearly enough to even compete with it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
"Really disappointed Genie didn't call Aladdin a ""fresh prince""","Aladdin is yet another cash grab; an exhaustive remake of a perfectly good animated Disney classic. An attempt to pander to both loyal Disney fans and potential new ones, Disney tries to bring Aladdin to life with CGI, a new look, and new faces. Of course, NOBODY could do Genie like the late and beloved Robin Williams, and it would be rather dull if Disney did a mirror remake of the original, so naturally doing things differently would be inevitable and sensible, and that's what they did, only they put little effort and creativity into it.Jam packed with enough messages about morals and modern politics to make even Sean Penn feel awkward, this preachy remake is mostly pomp and circumstance, having the costume design, some of the CGI, and a few of the jokes, really the only good points about the movie. The rest is mostly corny moments (""you can do it!""), confusing plot elements, extremely lame original music pieces, and otherwise lame attempts to be original while keeping the classic story intact. While Will Smith did a better job in the role of The Genie, one cannot shake the feeling that there were others out there who would have done much better. And of course, the writers are also partly to blame. But Smith did certainly shone brighter than the rest of the cast, who apparently were told to act like they're in a high school play.It would be unfair to completely condemn the movie, as it's obvious why many people would enjoy it. It might be right up their alley with their style of comedy, and I may be a tad biased because so far none of the live-action remakes of the childhood quintessential Disney flicks lives up to their standards. And yes, they WILL be compared to the classics, so don't act like they're supposed to ""stand on their own"" and such.All in all, it's yet another disappointment from Disney, who has the talent to do better, but they would rather try to appease as may people in a generic, paper-cutter, almost ""bureaucratic"" sort of way. The Lion King is our last hope....",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"

Thankfully her career will not be derailed by this iceberg. Will Smith comical stylings were no match to Robin Williams goofiness and he was a total miscast. As for Mena Massoud as Aladdin, he may have looked the part, but acting was wooden and he looked over eager to please throughout.Guy Ritchie as director was the biggest mistake as expected.

Modern Feminist and Value Adding to the original,"Aladdin is what Beauty and the Beast should have been like. Aladdin and Jasmine had great chemistry and Jasmine's singing voice is the best out of all the female leads in previous movies.
People often wonder why they should watch a live-action remake when the cartoon version is already so good. And Disney's live action were often disappointments, copy the original scene by scene. Not this one. Aladdin is the first and only disney princess movie to be named after a male lead, but it is also the most feminist and empowering one.
I was surprised to see that Jasmine is not a damsel in distress but she actually do something. She is the true star of the movie. Aladdin was a lost poor boy until he met her and unlocked his true potential.

An absolute classic!,"I did not enjoy it as much as Beauty and the Beast but it was still good. Had some big time interest in the casting seeing how Aladdin is from Markham, Ontario and a graduate of Ryerson University (my dad worked there for 25+ years and my brother is also a graduate). He was fantastic and so was Naomi Scott as Jasmine. The casting for these two characters was phenomenal. As for Jafar, wasn't a huge fan at first because of the actor's high pitched voice and how young he was (I always envisioned Jafar having a deep voice and being an older dude) but he was just as evil as one could be. The biggest surprise for me was Will Smith. He was great. I though it was the dumbest idea to cast him as the Genie but he quickly changed my mind and was perfect for the role.

Fun Homage to the 1992 with Some Weaknesses,"If you come into this as an Homage to the 1992 Robin Williams/Disney animation, then you will have a nice time. It's a fun, well-made musical, with many of the original songs and a couple of new ones, and some originals slightly remixed. The sets are colourfully OTT, looking like the Agrabah of the animation, and there are some good performances.
Now the weaknesses, and my main gripe with the film - Jafar. In the animation, he was a powerful, evil, man who was well spoken, with dry humour and just wanted more power. In this version he comes over just as a spoiled brat who just moans about being second all the time and doesn't want power as such, just moans about not being 'first'. Second, much less of a big gripe is that although he never tries to replace Robin Williams, (and you shouldn't see this film to compare him to the original) Will Smith just doesn't carry the movie enough. He is competent, and fun, but just doesn't give out the classic character feeling that Robin Williams' did.Overall, see this, it's a fun romp that you'll enjoy, sing-a-long to and then probably watch the 1992 version the next time you want to watch Aladdin!",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"
