Not your typical comicbook movie,"Christopher Nolan was right. This movie indeed came out too early.This movie not only shows us the pictures. But also the people behind them.
What I love about Watchmen is that it's mature and basic study of how our society is structured. There's so many quotes that can be used in todays world. And with Zack Snyders visuals. It really blends well.I gotta say. People calling this movie ""boring"" are the ones watching 4 movies a year. And they're all action heavy blockbusters.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
10 years later,"Some time after ""The Boys"" I decided to give this film a rematch... Back in 2009 it was still a time when there was not that many similar to each other superhero films Watchmen cam out a bit too early..., What makes Watchmen feeling so fresh in 2020 is that it's completely different to most of Marvel films.... The characters in Watchmen feel more like real people than idealistic figures you usually get - they age, they change opinions on things, they do wrong things... The world is also much more similar to ours in 2020 that it was in 2009... Brilliant film 9/10!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
2023 take,"I thought this movie was just OK when it came out in 2009. Now watching it in 2023 I am watching this movie realizing I was an idiot in 2009. I see the Boys and almost every comic movie since in it in 2023. They've all pulled something from Watchmen. Superheroes with real people problems that have real opinions negative and positive doing both good and bad things all the time. It's great and I'm finally seeing what those that got back in 2009 that were way ahead of the curve. Acting, camerawork, effects, costumes, story, nostalgia, all put on full display in this movie. Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Jackie Earle Haley put on a show in a movie that I felt like everyone was exceptional. That's how good they are. Give this another go if you're somehow here reading this debating on whether you should watch this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
The world wasn't ready for this super hero classic!,"After 14 years I watched this film again. And after all the MCU shenanigans, I gotta say this film is a masterpiece, from the story to the music and the super heroes. The fact that they are vulnerable makes it more interesting.Like I said in the tittle, the world wasn't ready for this movie, if it had came out in this time it would've blown the front door. The way it was made, special effects, graphic fight scenes, nudity, dark tone and soundtrack, Zack Snyder really knocked it out of the park with this one. This is how every super hero film should be made. Not a blockbuster comedy wanna be.For a super hero film, a true 10/10 in my book!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

My favorite movie ever?,"For over 25 years now, I have cited Blade Runner as my favorite movie of all time. After seeing Watchmen, I may have to reconsider.First, I'm glad I went to see the movie alone. I've heard so many comments focused on a blue dick, or the length of the movie, or some other such nonsense, that I'm sure watching it with someone would have been a constant barrage of commentary and complaint. And no, that's not Javier Bardem.Yes, the movie is long; nearly three hours. But, unlike the dreadfully insipid Titanic, at the end of this movie I wasn't asking for those three hours of my life back. And, as with all such movies, you must be able to look beyond the literal.Watchmen is iconic and iconoclastic, deconstructionist and revisionist, laden with allegory and allusion. Consider, for example, the character Ozymandias. I'm wondering how many people who viewed the film ever even heard of Percy Bysshe Shelley's poem by the same name. The character even quotes the poem on a plinth in his Antarctic lair. The allusion is amazing. Here's the full quote;And on the pedestal these words appear -- ""My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"" Nothing beside remains. Round the decay Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare The lone and level sands stretch far away.'Clearly one must see the allusion to the work, in this case, of a superhero who hopes to leave mankind a lasting legacy, but realizes in the back of his mind that everything is eventually lost in time. Ozymandias was the first poem I ever examined from an expositional point of view, and I was blown away. The use of it in this movie is equally impactful.Then there is Dr. Manhattan, named, of course, for the Manhattan Project, which yielded the atomic bomb. His character is an allegory for God, and his relationship with man mirrors the apparent detachment with which God sees suffering in the world He created. The deity reference is reinforced often, and one thinks of Oppenheimer's citation of the Bhagavad-Gita, in which Vishnu takes on a godly form and says, ""Now, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.""In an expository scene in the second act, Dr. Manhattan has a sort of recollection of his life. His account is dizzyingly elliptical, since he does not see time as linear the way others do. This scene has the lyrical feel of my favorite piece of fiction, Alan Lightman's almost unbearably beautiful Einstein's Dreams, and the reference to Einstein cannot be ignored.But the real beauty of Watchmen is the moral diversity of its superheroes. Each is flawed in different ways, allowing us to inhabit different ethical perspectives, intellectually at least, and witness their consequences. Everything from Rorshach's refusal to compromise, which makes him a doomed fugitive, to the ultimate compromise envisioned by Ozymandias, who can dispassionately evaluate scenarios where millions of lives are sacrificed, calls into question our most cherished beliefs. Where does it leave you? Well, that's for you to decide.From a purely entertainment perspective, Watchmen is stunning. The visuals are state of the art, and do not suffer from the sort of mental rejection I have for some movies that present too many special effects to swallow at once as reality. And Watchmen doesn't suffer from Hollywood's apparent fascination with camp in comic book movies. Camp works to some degree in Spiderman, since he's a somewhat humorous character to begin with. But the excess of camp rendered the Fantastic Four sequel unwatchable. Watchman proves that superheroes can use more subtle forms of humor, such as irony, without devolving into camp for cheap laughs.And the music, oh, the music. If you didn't grow up in the 60's and 70's, you will surely miss some of the impact, but don't worry. Even a second hand recollection of such iconic tunes will suffice. I am reminded of the painfully awful Across the Universe, which couldn't even pull together a decent movie built around the greatest catalog in modern music. Watchmen does it in spades.I LOL'd, I cried. The people in the theatre applauded at the end. I vowed to wait 24 hours before writing a review to see if my euphoria passed. It hasn't.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
We All Watch the Watchmen,"Let's get this out of the way - Watchmen the movie is not as good as the graphic novel.Zack Snyder's Watchmen is not your average graphic novel adaptation. Unlike with 300, which was short and sharp and shallow and easy to adapt, the original Watchmen is incredibly dense and, as written, unfilmable. So Snyder did something very smart - he didn't even try. What he did instead was to take the world of Watchmen and rebuild it in a way which made a virtue of this new medium (film) rather than try to cram the graphic novel into a cinematic form.Nowhere is this approach more obvious than in the film's title sequence. A wonderfully composed collage of images depicts scenes from the universe of Watchmen in a way which is only possible in the movies. In this way, we are subconsciously introduced to a world where costumed heroes are a part of everyday culture and brought, in a stylish and fluid way, from the original days of the Minutemen to those of the Watchmen. This introduction is cinematically perfect and is indicative of the heights which the Watchmen movie is perfectly capable of achieving but not quite capable of sustaining.Watchen is a brave film for a major studio to make and without a doubt it would not exist in its present form without the success of 300. It is incredibly dark (both in tone as well as shooting style) with events that would be anathema to any other superhero story. The less you know about the story, the better so there will be no spoilers here but suffice to say Watchmen's version of a happy ending is a far cry from the Hollywood norm.Snyders brings his unique approach to action to bear on Watchmen, expanding on the action scenes in the comic without making it feel too redundant. His efforts are ably supported by the incredibly game cast, excellent cinematography and near perfect visual effects - this film is incredible to look at but also manages to create an entire world in a way which most superhero stories never do. The attention to detail in even the smallest scenes is commendable and the dense flashback structure means the same attention is paid to the presentation of full and complex characters.Snyder has made a film which is gorgeous to look at, agreeably violent, well written, wonderfully designed and features some of the best small scale action sequences ever committed to celluloid. But, naturally, not everything is perfect. Most of the performances are excellent, with a cast of relative unknowns who manage to distinguish themselves despite constantly competing with overbearing effects and design. Patrick Wilson, in particular, does great work with a difficult role as Nite Owl, while Jackie Earle Hayley is blistering as Rorschach. Unfortunately in a film which could have done with a strong female presence, neither Carla Gugino nor Malin Ackerman make much of an impression, despite having quite a lot of screen time. Synder's musical cues are another bone of contention - often pushing the tone of the film into the realm of parody. And the ending... well let's just say it cheapens the experience in search of the lowest common denominator and the whole package suffers. On a related note, neither of the stories major revelations are handled that well. These moments were genuinely shocking in the graphic novel but are almost glossed over in the film.Don't get the wrong impression, Watchmen is a good film, sometimes a great film. Snyder has managed to make a movie which is a terrifically well balanced compromise between accessibility and fidelity. That anyone can sit down in the cinema and experience a distillation of the Watchmen universe in just 163 minutes is a marvel. It does not deliver the depth of feeling and connection of the novel but that is more a matter of the differences in the media than a failure on the part of the film.On its own merits, Zack Synder's Watchmen is a dark and twisted tale peopled with complex characters whose motivations are not obvious even to themselves. It is a solid film, sometimes rising into the extraordinary, and deserves to be successful. This is not Alan Moore's Watchmen but it is a competent extension of the universe into another medium and a worthy cinema-going experience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Get in line now......,"Screened FRebruary 23 for Australian Media.There's no reason for me to expect I was going to like Watchmen. I knew the cast was interesting - Patrick Wilson has made smart film choices that don't rely on or intentionally subvert his good looks (Hard Candy, Little Children); Jackie Earle Haley was icky in Little Children (and I'm old enough to remember him from Breaking Away); Malin Akerman is cute but 28 Dresses and The Heartbreak Kid do not a superhero make; Jeffery Dean Morgan, Matthew Goode - ??? And director Zack Snyder did cool things with zombies in Dawn Of The Dead and made a wild and wacky movie in 300, which totally indicated his third film was probably going to be worth a look, but...you know, whatever...So they all signed up for Watchmen - based on a comic bo...sorry, graphic novel...that I'd never read and that was coming to theatres less than a year after Ironman and The Dark Knight had redefined how good superhero movies could (and should, from here on in) aspire to be.That Watchmen has turned out to be the most complex, exhilarating and deeply-moving fantasy film since Terry Gilliam's Brazil surprises nobody on Earth more than me - and, man, did it surprise.In equal measure, it is a) an inspired vision of an alternate world that echoes but redefines our own existence; b) a subversive yet bracingly humanistic exploration of the role of the superhero in modern literature, c) a supremely adult take on the fetishistic pull of the heightened existence that life as a saviour of society creates, and d) a wildly exciting adventure story that turns normal people into exaggerated victims of their own creation and then back into mere humans.An exploration of the plot would reveal more vast themes, but at this early stage of its release I don't want to risk lessening the experience for anyone.I can reveal this - Billy Crudup as Dr Manhattan and Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach create characters every bit as captivating (and deserving of Oscar recognition) as Heath Ledger's Joker; Malin Akerman makes an entrance to the world of superhero timelessness that will be the fantasy of every teenage boy, aged 15 to 50; and from the flawless art direction, set design and special effects to a mesmerising soundtrack, Watchmen is a film that revels in the perfection of minor details.Be warned - those expecting Spiderman-like teen-angst or Fantastic Four-like silliness will be stunned, perhaps not quite sure of what they have found. Watchmen is an extraordinarily mature, risky project for Hollywood to role the dice on, especially given similarly-complex explorations of social collapse and vigilantism (V For Vendetta, most specifically) have failed to do blockbuster numbers.But Watchmen is something special and deserving of analysis and discussion. As bold an attempt at commercial film-making as I can remember, Watchmen is an undeniably unique movie experience - rich, perverse, violent and resonant.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
The greatest superhero story ever told.,"Watchmen turned out to be an engrossing film, one definitely worth seeing. I have to say, I wasn't enthusiastic about watching it at first. It's based on the great graphic novel by Alan Moore. It's widely considered to be the best graphic novel ever. Films adapted form great literary works usually don't turn out well. The film also didn't have a big budget. More money was thrown at making Iron Man (2008) and The Dark Knight (2008), for example. This doesn't matter though because Watchmen surpasses all comic book films in terms of professionalism. Zack Snyder is a good action director. Just watch 300 (2007) for proof. With Watchmen he demonstrated that he is just a good director overall. He works well with actors. The acting in the film is almost universally excellent. Everyone gets to shine. Even Malin Akerman had her moments. Not one character feels like a throwaway. All this is further complimented by the good choices in costumes. No one can deny that the heroes in Watchmen look cool. The CGI is excellent too. Be it Doctor Manhattan or Nite Owl's airship, everything looks just right. Snyder staged some truly impressive dramatic scenes. The use of music is inspired. The score by Tyler Bates is obviously fitting, but the choices in songs may surprise some people. I, however, think that the songs are just right. It was good to hear Bob Dylan's ""The Times They Are a-Changing"" at the beginning and Leonard Cohen's ""First We Take Manhattan"" at the end. What made me like the film even more is its cinematography by Larry Fong. The look of each decade was captured perfectly. The 1980s are somewhat dark in the film's alternate reality though. Nuclear war seems close, and society is sick. To all this is added the sweet look that's also present in the graphic novel. There are many images in Watchmen that are memorable, even unforgettable. There are so many interesting details that I couldn't wait to watch the film more than once to pick up what I missed on first viewing. Thankfully, Snyder didn't change the politics and observations of the graphic novel for the film. Some parts are missing but the endeavour is still a thought-provoking two-and-a-half hours. Plus, it has a clear narrative. This is a comic book film for mature audiences. It stands above other comic book films because it's smart and because it tackles some of the most important issues, even mankind's existence. Watchmen was expertly made, there is a lot to like about it. I respect it and I like it more than any other superhero motion picture. It gets a high recommendation from me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Stays True to the ""Big Joke,""  But This  May Confuse Some.","Before anyone sees this film, Zach Snyder should be given a pat on the back. He did what a dozen directors struggled to do for twenty years: he made a Watchmen movie. It seems unthinkable that anyone could properly put the greatest graphic novel of all time on the screen. But Snyder has done pretty much that.While it is not Alan Moore's Watchmen, it is the closest thing that anyone else could have put on the screen. Snyder approached the material with enough reverence that fans of the comic will appreciate the film. As Snyder has openly declared, the final act does include significant changes, but the alterations that take place fit better on the big screen than the original ending would have. It works because it cuts down on a lot of the necessary back story which Snyder could not include.Even though many pages of the book were not included, Snyder did take the time to try and preserve other information by including short ""historical"" sequences in the fantastic opening title sequence. By this point, viewers will also have had a chance to appreciate the stellar, and time appropriate, soundtrack. Unlike the hard rock recordings the Snyder chose for the background of 300, Watchmen's background fits the tone and mood of most of the scenes. The only questionable choice was the selection of Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah,"" not because of the recording, but rather its awkward placement. Some may also question Snyder's inclusion of gore not present in the book. While the comic does include it's share of violence, Snyder did overtly change several scenes to be more violent. These changes, while flashy on film, may disturb squeamish moviegoers. However, changes aside, Snyder has captured the essence of the book and packaged it in a beautiful 2 hour and 40 minute delight. Overall, it is a satisfying film experience for someone familiar with the source material.But this might be a different experience for anyone who does not know the book. There is a lot to digest, and the overwhelming visuals may distract some moviegoers from the bigger picture. The interaction of these unique characters remains an integral point to understanding this film, and when the book was pared down for the movie, the relationships of the masked adventures became a bit more forced. The best part of the comic was the glimpse of what is ""beneath the hood,"" and we have less of that in Snyder's adaptation. Additionally, the ending, while simplified, is still a bit convoluted.Fans and those previously unfamiliar with Watchmen should go in with an open mind. Snyder has performed what Doctor Manhattan might deem a miracle, so it may take more than one viewing to truly appreciate this unique adaptation.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Superheros without regular clichés,"A group of ex-heroes now abandoned and limited by governments lives in the shadows until someone starts to eliminate them one by one. Rorschach is one of these heroes that begins searching for clues to his old colleagues' murders. The story is one of the most powerful aspects of the movie. Plot twists are good and complicated enough to make it interesting. I have watched the ultimate cut and it had another story in the story that was visualized by animation and somehow related to the main story.The cast is another great aspect of the film. Good actors like Jeffrey Dean-Morgan, and Patrick Wilson along with a whole crew of amazing cast is expecting you.CG, art, costume design, music, and soundtracks are quite good, especially for a movie released 13 years ago. Zack Snyder did his best in converting one of the darkest and most complex comic books into a movie by being faithful to the books. The only setback, in my opinion, is the length of the film. 3 and a half hours even for an ultimate cut is long if you cannot balance the action and dialogs. This made watchmen a little boring in some places, as I said, it's not balanced so there is maybe an hour in the middle of the movie without much going but on the other hand, you have lots of new information in the last 15 minutes.Overall, Watchmen is a good superhero movie without regular clichés. It can be worth your while if you are into the genre. But it could get boring sometimes in the middle of it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Watchmen is a fascinating graphic novel adaptation that deserves to be seen by anybody that likes their movies complex, dark, and absorbing.","Watchmen is the long-awaited graphic novel adaptation that has for a long time been deemed un-filmable. There have been many different points over the years where this movie was supposed to be made, which always ended up not happening. But now Watchmen is finally here in all its glory, and it's probably the best adaptation possible of this complex graphic novel. The story takes place in an alternative 1985, with Nixon beginning his third term as president, and the streets of New York are gritty, dark, and violent. Within New York lives a group of costumed heroes that used to be loved by society, but are now hated by practically everybody. One night a depressed retired hero named The Comedian is murdered by a masked person that breaks into his apartment. Another hero named Rorschach, who wears a mask with shifting ink blots, believes that someone is picking off costumed heroes to begin their own agenda of destruction. Rorschach begins investigating and hunting down the person that is responsible for The Comedian's death. Meanwhile we meet another hero who glows blue, and has almost literally become a God. His name is Dr. Manhattan, and although he has the power to save the world he won't do it because he has lost many of his human emotions. The other main costumed heroes are Night Owl and Silk Spectre, who begin to fall in love amid the chaos of their secret lives. Any other attempt to describe the complex plot of this movie would be nearly impossible.Watchmen was an extremely complex graphic novel filled with a lot of flawed costumed characters, strong plot, powerful sense of style, and also contained a world that seems a little too close to our own. The movie carries every one of these elements in the best way it possibly could. It stays true to the novel, and only changes a few details. The memorable characters are very well portrayed and acted as well. Dr. Manhattan (the giant blue guy) is played very well by Billy Crudup, who manages to keep the character interesting despite his emotionless attitude. Malin Akerman (Silk Spectre II), Patrick Wilson (Night Owl II), and Matthew Goode (Adrian Veidt) are also very good in their roles. However the two actors that truly help add depth and a real sense of anger to the film are Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian, and Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. Rorschach was probably my favorite character because technically he's not really a hero at all. He's a psychopath with harmful and destructive behavior, even though in a way he's trying to do what he believes is right for the world. He is a fascinating character with his shape-shifting mask full of ink blots that mirror his personality.The movie takes place in 1985 and mimics what was happening back then. Watchmen's story revolves around the threat of nuclear war and global destruction, and the characters mostly try to do the right thing for the world but have trouble seeing the point in doing so. This is a great film that stays true to the original graphic novel while transitioning its style, characters, chain of events, and storyline from page-to-screen the best it possibly could. However if you're not familiar with the source material you may find yourself confused by this movie. It's not like The Dark Knight where everybody that goes to see it knows who Batman and the Joker are. These characters are not as famous as those types of household name characters, and may be hard for someone's whose never read the novel to understand. Personally I only read a few chapters before I saw the movie, and I thought the movie was incredible. I always give a movie props for not taking the easy way out by spoon-feeding everything to the audience. The book, as well as the movie, was daring by taking of the risk of being complex and making you think for a change. Watchmen is a great movie, and despite its long running time of 163 minutes, I never found it boring at all. Watchmen is a fascinating graphic novel adaptation that deserves to be seen by anybody that likes their movies complex, dark, and absorbing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

A classic.,One of the deepest most sophisticated nuanced super hero movies ever. Production quality is amazing. The story is complex and long but worth the payoff. The acting is great overall. The hero's are vulnerable in so many ways. For every ability they have they suffer from even worse flaws. This is an alternate universe that forks from historical events. Rorschach is my favorite anti hero of all time and the end for me is an emotional powerful climax thats always a gut punch. Soundtrack is spot on. Should have won an Oscar or at least a nomination for any number of categories imo. Genre changing idea as profound and well crafted as the first matrix by comparison. Wouldn't be surprised if the MCU borrowed many ideas from this epic.

Best movie I've seen in a long time,"Firstly, I have not read the graphic novel. This was deliberate, since I knew there was going to be a movie, and reading any book tends to ruin the movie. I'm sure there are a whole bunch of things in the graphic novel that they left out or changed, and it's hard for those who have read it to imagine how people could understand the subtleties of the story without it. But trust me, the morally complex, multi-layered characters and plot were very well delivered by the movie alone. There was nothing that seemed like it didn't make sense or wasn't quite explained. The movie was just about perfect.I'm surprised to hear a lot of reviews saying that this is just an action movie for teenage boys; I thought quite the opposite. There was much less action than I expected, the movie centered mostly on emotions and ideas conveyed through dialog, narration and character flashbacks. The action scenes were all fairly short, though when there was action it was delightfully innovative. There were a lot of nasty and unexpected twists like limbs snapping, guts sticking to the ceiling, bones audibly crunching... Every time something violent happened, they made it interesting and shocking rather than recreating the generic ho-hum violence of every other movie. (And there was no obligatory 30-minute-long final action scene culminating in the conclusion of the plot... oh joy! Those get so boring.) Plus, many of the scenes were rather bold for a mainstream film, and showed certain things that are normally hidden off-screen or completely avoided. The only example I feel I can give without spoiling anything is the full frontal male nudity, something that is rather conspicuously hidden in almost every Hollywood movie. This movie isn't concerned about hiding little things like that, just as it isn't concerned about hiding certain subjects that most movies wouldn't show.This movie definitely isn't for everyone. People expecting another Dark Knight will be disappointed (or, as in my case, thrilled), as this movie is completely unique. People who want an action movie and don't want all that talking and thinking will be disappointed. But to those looking for a long, complicated, deeply moving epic that will really make them think about the very concepts of right, wrong, and heroism (and who haven't read the book, which based on other reviews seems to ruin it): Do NOT miss this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A Dark Insight into the Superhero World,"Starting off, I am just reviewing the film overall and not taking in account any of the written sources it's based off. Watchmen seems to be a complex film, and I'm sure and extremely hard to make an adaption of. It seems with dealing with material, such as this one, it's almost impossible to please everybody.Watchmen is a about a team of superheros that look after or ""watch"" the world around it and society which is supposed to take place in 1985. Be warned: this is not your regular superhero movie. Watchmen seems to reveal a much darker existence and reality into their world, the world of these superheros that we have seen so many times before. This isn't teenage Peter Parker, running and flying through the streets of New York. This is a much darker piece of work including, graphic violence, murder, sex scenes and nudity between these heroes. This film could be described as controversial with all the history, themes and meanings it goes through. It expands through many historical events, such as the Vietnam War and the Nixon Presidency.The film starts off with a murder and a mystery that surrounds it. (As it is said in the plot.) This side of the story was very interesting and entertaining. It kept my interest going forward, not knowing what to expect. Interesting, and suspenseful with a sort of realism to it. Then the film sort of gradually goes off into more of a fantasy setting, with a whole bunch of outer space, mystical objects, creatures, and end of the world hints. I didn't really care for this side of the story, but it is sort of a fantasy superhero film, based on the graphic novel, so I can't knock it for being what it is supposed to be. What I didn't like, was how long it took to actually discover what was going on with the plot, which turned out to be a bit confusing. There was a bunch of goofy and corny parts, which really wasn't needed or could have been done better. The sex scene for example, seemed kind of forced and awkward.Now to the characters since its more of a character driven piece anyway. Oscar nominated actor, Jackie Earle Haley, completely stole the show as Rorschach. Every time he wasn't on screen, I just kept waiting for him to come back. I loved his character and his storyline. There's not enough good things I can say about him and his performance. Him alone, makes the film worthwhile, in my opinion. Just what if the others could be as good... Well for Malin Akerman as Silk Spectre II, I can't say she was bad, but not all that great. It seems obvious that she was pretty much put in this film as eye candy, which she definitely succeeds at. Overall, I liked the rest of the cast and thought they did a pretty good job with a few weak moments (mainly Ackerman). Some of the action sequences seem like they could have been done better. Snyder's style made them look ""out of synch.""The visual look and feel of the film is well done. The opening credits scene with the song playing is fantastic. The song ""Times are a Changin' by Bob Dylan plays in the background as these credits really set the tone and mood for the film. Beautifully done. Not all of the songs seemed to fit though. Some of them seemed really out of place and even awkward at times. Interesting, dark cinematography with some great visuals. Most of the writing and dialog was great, particularly, Rorschach's scenes and lines. Maybe Haley just made it that much better? There is some weak moments as well mostly with Ackerman's lines. Maybe because some of her weak delivery of some of her lines. Don't mean to pick on her, but she seems to be the weak link in this one.Overall, Watchmen seems like a dense, deep, complex look at the superhero world. It made for an interesting film, that I just had to see because I was so intrigued by the R rating with the dark graphic nature of this kind of superhero film. It's not perfect, and I'm sure some people won't like it, but a pretty good film nonetheless. If you go in looking for an interestingly done story about a new kind of insight to the dark world of superheros then this film should work for you. 6.5-7 out of 10",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Well worth watching the watchmen,"The graphic novel source material is a masterpiece, bold, uncompromising, subtle, witty, imaginative with very unique characters and an immersive world. Albeit one that is near-unfilmable, with the themes, the huge amount of content and the amount of depth needed, a three hour film sounded nowhere near enough on paper. Plus Zack Snyder is nowhere near close to being a favourite of mine, but saw 'Watchmen' anyway because of my love for the source material, that it looked fantastic and because the cast are very talented.'Watchmen' really is well worth your time. More the director's cut though than the theatrical release, though both versions have the exact same brilliant qualities. Of which there are many in 'Watchmen'. It is a prime example of how to transcribe a graphic novel to film, while not being as good and not having everything there, and still be near-great on its own terms. It is by far Snyder's best film in my view, as well as being his most mature and ambitious, being the only one to be above good and be more than style over substance. His other films left me mixed to indifferent.Is 'Watchmen' perfect? No. It does feature one of the most uncomfortable-feeling and pointless love scenes on film, and Leonard Cohen (well certainly for the song in question, it is a great song that is not well used) has never been used more awkwardly in visual media in my view (partly because in my opinion it doesn't fit with the context of the scene).Matthew Goode is also a bit too stiff and subdued as Ozymandias. Actually do prefer Jeremy Irons' more eccentric and all out portrayal in the recent series, despite the character being a lot less puzzling here. So it is easy to see why 'Watchmen' is a divisive film, though more for its heavy, polarising themes, the huge length (that sounds overlong on paper), that figuring out what's going on admittedly is not easy for anybody who is not familiar with the graphic novel and it seems that the ending has left people divided (the ending in the source material sparks much debate as well).For all of the flaws mentioned, so much works in 'Watchmen's' favour. It looks amazing for one thing. Very stylish and imaginative with some incredible special effects, there is nowhere near as much gratuitous slow-motion here than seen in some of Snyder's other work. The opening sequence is absolutely amazing in as jaw-dropping a way as you can get, what a way to start a film. The music is nostalgic and atmospheric, with mostly inspired use of great songs. Only the Cohen song in the scene in question is questionable. Snyder's direction is some of his most ambitious and doesn't try to do too much to the same extent as his other films.Moreover, the script compels, flows naturally and raises interesting ideas that provokes thought, managing not to trivialise its difficult content. A good deal of talk but not too exposition-heavy, even when focused on Dr Manhattan in the middle act. There is not much subtlety here, Snyder and subtlety never belonged in the same sentence, but the ironic wit translates well to film from the graphic novel as does the maturity. The length is a long one, but the source material is massive so the film really needed to be long. If anything, in terms of adapting it would be better a mini-series. The story makes the most of getting one immersed in an authentically rendered world, and thematically it is bold and executed in an unforgivably uncompromising approach as ought. The violence shocks but didn't come over as gratuitous and the action thrills. Didn't have much of a problem with the ending, but can see why others would, the climax is thrillingly staged at least.A good job is done with the characters, though Adrian Veidt/Ozymandias is underused and a bit underdeveloped. Night Owl and in particular Rorschach being the standouts, though The Comedian is also a difficult role to pull off. Apart from reservations with Goode, the performances are strong. Jackie Earle Haley is perfect casting as Rorschach, and have no qualms with Billy Crudup, Patrick Wilson and Jeffrey Dean Morgan either. The most difficult roles, pulled off beautifully.Overall, very good and nearly great, with a lot done extremely well with a couple of misgivings. The polarisation is understandable but the appeal is even more so. The recent adaptation, despite getting a lot of over the top hate very prematurely into its run is also worth seeing. It is a slow starter and ends anti-climactically but there is so much brilliant about it, and if one sticks with it if put off by the first couple of episodes it to me and others got a lot better. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Yikes, possibly of the greatest films ever made,","I have a serious problem with this film. I have seen it a half-dozen times, taken it apart, put it back together, tried to find something wrong with it and I cannot. I am coming to the reluctant conclusion it may be one of the greatest films ever made, likely a top-10, right up there with Citizen Kane, Alien, Godfather, you know the drill. The story is dazzling, action-packed, politically aware, and brilliant. As good or better than Sin City. The actors, many of whom (sigh) I am not familiar with are brilliant. Jackie Earle Haley practically picks the film up bodily and carries it. The direction is not merely good it is perfect. Even the sound track seems to move the story along. (And I am no fan of Zack Synder outside of this film. MAN OF STEEL was a sellout to the ""action"" crowd, creating chaos out of order. Ditto Sucker Punch). But art is like that. Sometimes it surprises you. Many critics have said that Social Network is the new Citizen Kane. But they confabulate. This film could actually be.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

WARNING: Overrated MOVIE,"This is a terrible movie. I want to save tons of people time and money. I am usually a very very faithful imdber, and most ratings I see on IMDb are very representative of the rating I would give it personally. (Most of the time I can guess a movies IMDb just by my own personal preference of the movie).Anyways, I went to watch this movie knowing it got an 8.5. I expected it to be overrated by all the Watchmen lovers / cult people. If you have read the comic book (i think its a comic book not sure), I'm sure you have a different opinion of this movie.For me, it was lame. This is why:1) Very very slow movie. 2) Corny lines. 3) The action sequences were not particularly exciting. In fact I would say that I arguably didn't even see a single new type of scene that I haven't seen in another movie.If I could include spoilers I would be able to let you know why I thought this movie was so bad. Since I can't, to give you an example of how much I didn't like this film, I went with 3 people. 1 left the movie 1 hour in. Me and the other felt like there was a chance it would pick up so we stayed in the movie. By less then the 2nd hour, I was asking my friend if he wanted to leave as well. We stuck through. As soon as we saw close to the end we got up and left.This movie was terrible because it is a cliché and extremely excruciating to watch such a slow movie. The action scenes are nothing new, and just because a movie has a lot of blood in an action scene doesn't make it good. The voice of one of the main characters is so freaking annoying.This movie at best deserves a 6. I would prefer to give it a 5.5, but a 6 is what I give it because the visual effects of the movie, are actually very well made. That was the one positive of the movie. Some very cool ideas, and some cool effects. However, dialogue, sequence, action scenes, everything else made it not good.Be prepared to enjoy the visual effects, albeit in action sequences that are predictable and played out. Enjoy the cool quantum mechanics related ideas. But as for enjoying a movie? This isn't a movie to enjoy.PS Treat this review from the perspective of someone who hasn't read the watchmen, but went into the movie thinking it would be awesome from the trailer. So no, I wasn't biased into thinking it sucked from the beginning, it just actually sucked from the beginning. I have no biases, I actually was hoping to see an amazing film. I was terribly disappointed.Watch the Watchmen expecting a film that deserves a 5 on IMDb and you will get what you paid for. Watch it expecting a 8.4 (which it currently shows), and you will be EXTREMELY disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"It is not too late. Never has been, never will be too late.","A short warning first. You may like action-packed toy/game inspired or superhero movies, like Transformers or X-Man, where the action has priority over message - or there is no message at all. Do not be alarmed if it is true, there is nothing wrong with you. It simply indicates most probably you will not enjoy Watchmen. Stop reading and look somewhere else. Otherwise, please continue.I begun to learn English reading comics, Superman, Spiderman, Batman, X-Men and FF later. But that was more than 40 years ago, when I was young. Therefore, I had never heard about Watchman phenomenon, until I bought a DVD with the theatrical version. Then it begun. I saw the complete movie several times day after day. I became obsessed by its characters and themes. I put away my work for a few days, doing research on the Internet. I found out the movie is controversial for many. Not for me. It is a true masterpiece of a rare kind, something much more than a sum of all its ingredients. All parts fit together, while every part makes others stronger.The story is fascinating, the characters are psychologically rich, complex and morally ambiguous. If you look deeper, you find lots of disturbing and sometimes unanswered questions about politics, people and societies. Some of those questions flow from the movie's motto. Who watched President Bush when he launched the Iraqi war, to finish the job his father did not ? Who watched Israeli Cabinet, when it launched the Gaza Offensive to improve its poll ratings ahead of elections ? Who watches Iranian Ayatollahs and their dreams to create a new Persian Empire, no matter what ?Equally intriguing are questions about the human nature. Are dictators, who sacrifice millions so easily, driven by their lust for power or by a dream of ideal societies envisioned for their nations ? Do they truly believe in their utopias ? What is really behind brutality and trigger-happiness of some of the law enforcement officials ? Do they loose control or enjoy their work too much ? Why some people prefer death to avoid betrayal of their values ? Am I ready to do that ? These are some of the questions I ask myself, but there are much more from different perspectives. This movie makes you think hard about the world around.Acting is from satisfactory to very good. The best actor is Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. Should get Oscar Nomination. However, I found Jeffrey Dean Morgan, The Comedian, as the most charismatic. He steals every scene he is in. As for the music, the original motion picture score is good, but it is the incidental music I applaud. The opening sequence, the funeral and Dr. Manhattan's Mars monologue are the most powerful scenes in the movie and the music is responsible for such impact. Bob Dylan is a songwriting genius and The Times They Are A-Changin' is a perfect background. The Sound of Silence illustrates introductory funeral images in an unforgettable way. As for Dr. Manhattan's Mars monologue, music written by Philip Glass is a brilliant choice - particularly as the laboratory where he gains his superpowers is run by Professor Glass. And then comes All Along The Watchtower, one of my all-time favorites. I will recall the related movie scene every time I hear it till I die.Some question the 99 Luftballons as the right choice, but not me. The decision to use it converted the accompanied scene into a small jewel. I raised the eyebrow only once, when I heard Hallelujah. After the second Watchman watch it dropped down however.Needless to say, I ordered the novel immediately after my first Watchmen watch. I just completed my first reading and it is certainly not the last one. I had never read a graphic novel before and I am happy it was the first one. Now, it is the interaction between Watchmen The Novel and The Movie which makes my amazement and impression so deep and lasting. Watchmen The Novel fills some of the gaps and provides more context for many scenes. Watchmen The Movie enriches the pictures and texts. For me, both are perfectly complementary.It seems most of the critics sided with Alan Moore, who stated Watchmen The Novel cannot be translated into a movie. That is the writer's right. But if a movie critic does not judge the movie as such, but how well - or not well - the book was adopted, then he or she should take care of the books. Movies should be judged on their own and Watchmen is a true masterpiece as a standalone work. But even if the book is taken into account, the adaptation is at least very good in my view. The changes, omissions and additions make sense because of the time frame and other factors, Zack Snyder's style included. I understand some of the fans of the book were disappointed by simplifications and the end in particular. Let us be serious, shall we ? Watchmen story takes place on an alternate Earth, right ? Think of The Movie and The Novel as parallel worlds that overlap mostly and differ in some respects. Such worlds can happily coexist together, as an extension of the original Watchman concept. If we accept imaginary worlds, why there should be only one ?The movie has some tiny flaws, but they disappear without a trace when you look at the whole. Watchman The Movie would not be so great without Watchman The Novel. Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons created a masterpiece in a graphical form. Zack Snyder turned it into a movie masterpiece. If you are still with me, see Watchmen The Movie and you should enjoy it as I did, do and will. It is not too late. Never has been, never will be too late for that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Important: I have not read the comic,"Where do I even begin?My favorite movie, the best movie ever
Watchmen by Zack Snyder is the best superhero movie, because of it's harsh dark rainy and horny erotic nature it is very different from most superhero movies
The plot is awesome, the individual characters are incredible, everyone is ticked off, the chemistry works great
Favorite characters are Rorschach, Comedian and Dreiberg
Rorschach is terrific, the incredible scenes when he heroically sits on the window and the music comes on. The Comedian, has a perfect opening scene, awesome fight. As a character in general terrific
Dreiberg aka Nite Owl, works great in chemistry with Rorschach and that ass wow

Realistic superhero story,"Zack Snyder opened the world of superheroes for me from a different, unusual side, showing this visual masterpiece. Of course, the master was based on the famous comic book series authored by Alan Moore, but Snyder presented his picture very cool.I must say that for the maximum effect of immersion in this story, it is necessary to watch the maximum version of the film, which lasts a little more than 3.5 hours. In this case, the audience has the opportunity to fully feel the vision of the author of this work. This has already happened with many other Snyder projects, but it is the versions that are not cut for film distribution that come out excellent and finished.Zack is a visual artist. Every frame and every scene in this work has a certain role. Snyder masterfully withstands pauses, pumps up in those moments where it is really necessary. He uses all the available techniques of cinema very correctly. Here, his frequent ""use"" of the time dilation effect does not cause irritation, as happens in films by other authors. Snyder knows exactly what he wants to show on the screen for his fans, what the viewer's attention should be focused on at this or that moment, he understands how to interest and allow viewers to feel his story.The Guardians show us an alternate universe where superheroes exist, and the political situation escalated to the point in the mid-1980s that an atomic war was about to begin, promising to wipe the human species off the face of the planet. Superheroes also directly influenced and influence this story. One can recall their presence at the front of the fighting in Vietnam and the subsequent end of the war in a completely different result.The great timing of the film and the non-linearity of the narrative is an excellent idea of the screenwriters. Events scattered across the timeline will absolutely not confuse viewers. On the contrary, this approach allows you to get to know the numerous characters of the film better through flashbacks, better understand their motivations, and then completely put together the scattered pieces of the mosaic that will lead to an interesting ending. All this allows us to get a noir thriller-detective, where the intrigue persists until the very end. And the main idea, which is voiced by one of the heroes of the work, makes you get goosebumps. The cruel and at the same time absolutely truthful logic makes us understand such a decision of the conditional villain of the picture, maybe not to agree with him, but not to condemn him either. The world of this universe is too cruel, it has come close to certain death, but in order to try to avoid the nuclear threat, you need to be ready to go to great lengths.In the final, everyone will make their own conclusion for themselves, they will definitely be able to discuss this story with other viewers. And it will undoubtedly be difficult to tell everyone for himself, but what would you do in such a situation? Would you be able to discard all thoughts and concepts of valor and honor? Could you be so strong and cold-blooded in the name of all mankind? Very difficult questions. But they arise from thinking viewers. They make you dig into yourself. And this is another merit of this film and the whole story as a whole.The cast is simply gorgeous. Everyone is in their place here. Of course, the Comedian, Dr. Manhattan, Ozymandias, Night Owl, Rorschach and Miss Jupiter are especially memorable. Each of the actors gave their heroes something unique, and the skillfully written script and excellent directing revealed each hero to the viewer. There are no heroes and villains in the usual sense. This world is cruel and real enough to understand. The world is not divided into black and white. It's gray. It is dominated by those who go to the end.Visual effects and musical themes are on top. What is the cost of the transformation of Dr. Manhattan to the famous Philip Glass track, which gets a new life here.""The Guardians"" is an undoubted success of director Zack Snyder, who will give us many more powerful paintings in the future. But this film has become unique in its own way. Cruel and gloomy, beautiful and uncompromising, interesting and memorable. A great story that will definitely make you ask a lot of questions and understand for yourself how you would act in the current situation and having the opportunity to influence the destinies of millions and billions.9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

so good,"This is a different kind of movie on heroes. Whenever think about heroes and their powers, all I could have in my mind is saving the earth, defeating villains, winning peace and love. But for Watchmen, everything is disrupted and blurred. It's apocalyptic and tragic on the one hand, and very human or even subhuman on the other. Heroes who are supposed to help people are not able to do it due to their individual reasons. The world is getting dark and desperate, and heroes are getting to lose powers.Watchmen is very huge and enormous, because it deals with many prominent events in human history. It is even philosophical, and makes people think about human beings themselves.The best character for me is Rorschach. I don't know exactly why, but I am just attracted to him. I guess it is because he is only right one in this movie, although he is considered freak and weirdo all the time. What he says and shows in his journal always impresses me a lot. Rorschach is my all time favorite hero ever. Also, I really like Jackie Earle Haley's performance. He is a great actor. His voice and every step he makes were Rorschach itself.After watching the movie Watchmen, I read the original graphic novel. I think both movie and novel are great.

"Compelling, exciting and original","It is 1985, Richard Nixon is serving his fifth term as US president and the world stands on the brink of destruction as the world's two superpowers vie for nuclear supremacy. The only thing stopping the USSR from launching a doomsday attack is America's Dr Manhattan  a being with enough power to destroy planets and much else besides.Wow! I was lucky enough to watch this at a preview screening in London last night and came to the film with little knowledge about what to expect. Having seen the posters around the place and perhaps catching one or two of the trailers I was expecting something akin to another ""X-Men"" movie (which frankly I've never found particularly interesting). However, it was a very pleasant surprise to find that Zack Snyder has served up something entirely fresh and quite dazzling. Watchmen takes the well-worn superhero format and turns it on its head. As you would expect from a movie of this genre you get a tale of attempted world domination by evil baddies, good guys wearing latex costumes, fistfuls of action and spectacular special effects. What you would not expect is to have this interwoven with eye-watering violence (a scene where one particularly nasty bad guy gets a meat cleaver brought down on his forehead being one example), full frontal male nudity (albeit computer generated) and rampant satire. The US political system, military posturing and blind patriotism are all given a bit of a roasting by David Hayter and Alex Tse's script. Add to this a host of compelling performances, notably Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach and Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl, and you have an exceptional cinematic experience.Watchmen is no ordinary superhero movie and likely to manage the difficult feat of satisfying both the fan-boys and the uninitiated punters (like myself). Its success means it must be highly likely that there will be a sequel  if not several. Catch this early if you can and be one of the first to witness that rarefied thing in cinema  something beautiful, exciting and original.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

A Hidden Gem and a complete masterpiece,"First of all, this is not your typical cbm movies. If you only prefer comedy, humor, and some one and a half hour of fun without hardly a proper story - this movie is definitely not for you.I will always consider this one as one of the best cbm movies of all time. I have watched almost all marvel and dc movies and series. I must say, this one is a unique movie by design. The recent marvel and dc movies feel like just some cheap thrills and meaningless dialogs and fighting sequence, hardly any story at all. I watch them only once - then i lose interest completely. But this one, i still feel like watch again and again and not feel bored at all.This is not like the recent cbm movies, rather a unique one- which has a very interesting plot if you give it some thoughts. This is not also focused on a super hero either. But the flow of the movie is just so mesmerizing, the characters are so well developed and portrayed. I mean, u can think dr.manhattan - a being with supreme power - delivering a powerful character like that nicely is very difficult - but the way he was depicted in this movie is just mind-blowing. I dont think anyone else could have done that so beautifully except snyder.My most favorite character here is definitely rorschach and from start to finish, i was completely hooked at this character.Finally, hats off to snyder to deliver such an epic masterpiece.

It was all a joke...,"A prevailing sense of nihilism washes over the bleak and barren landscape of Alan Moore's graphic novel, the pages lined with fragments of doubt, paranoia, anger and mistrust. It's a depiction of humanity that does not spare any dark corner from the revealing rays of sunlight, casted instead into clear vision; stark, undignified and frightening all the same. Dr. Manhattan would have us believe that we as humans reassure ourselves into thinking that we are in control through delusions of pseudo-omnipotence—a vague and callous form of collective megalomania, devoid of universal sympathy, or an ounce of concrete truth. Indeed, he asserts that rather than embrace the truths of our existence, we would prefer to shelter ourselves under blankets of frivolous distractions fit to serve us to our dying days when we finally have to come face to face with the cold bitter reality that we all mush perish. A dead body he says, isn't any different from a live one; at least, not in form; not in its molecular makeup. It's a cold, objective look at life through the lens of a cynical, and yet completely unbiased view.Watchmen, in very many ways is simply an embodiment, or elaboration on Dr. Manhattan—a twisted, contorted form, long distant from its idealistic and human ways, instead embracing an indifferent and foreboding stance. The world that Moore paints isn't pretty, no, but it's far from the pages of fiction; or at least, that overbearing sense of reality that governs its message is, and it's tangible and potent enough to go beyond mere fiction. In this regard, Watchmen exists as a rare breed of film that works just as well off the screen as it does on it—it's a film about ideas, criticisms on our own existence, and questions that beg to be answered amidst the petty babbling and double edged swords of modern semantics. Most of all however, Watchmen is a film that manages to do all this, all the while telling a unique and unforgettable tale that resonates long after the conclusions are drawn, the bombs are dropped and the orchestra begins to pack up their instruments.Without a doubt, Moore's depiction here is an Earth rooted in dystopia—if there was a God, he is nowhere to be seen now, and to a select few this was only a matter of time, even if most of the world have only just caught up to the obituary penned by Nietzsche a century earlier. But these select few, casted out years beforehand as a result of a growing disdain from the public for their seemingly threatening amount of power, The Watchmen as they were once known, no longer serve the people—in fact, most are either dead, insane, or have settled down to live as a regular Joe Hasbeen. Yet with disaster looming in the air, there is a spark somewhere off in the distance, and in that short ray of light comes a small miracle; a glimpse of hope for mankind.Behind this parody and criticism of the commonly accepted superhero mythos, Watchmen details a potent struggle of the hopeless, nihilistic revelations of world gone astray, with the idealistic, somewhat existentialistic hope of a select few with the power to make a difference. Hidden beneath the cracks of Moore's story is an allegory of morality broadened with empathy rather than prevailing omnipotence; it's about a society coming to the brinks of their deaths and then taking one last breath before the final page is slowly turned for the good or bad fortune of mankind.Make no mistake, this is a feature that doesn't suit well to casual viewings taken purely on an ostensible level; it isn't built for passively soaking in to the background ambiance of popcorn crunching and soda slurping—in fact, this is a superhero movie that isn't even about superheroes. It demands attention and patience, something which modern cinema goers have no doubt lost much of over the course of the last decade or so. The ""superheroes"" of Watchmen (being no such thing in actuality) exist primarily to offer grander, more exaggerated images, and expressions of our own qualities as human beings, and with that, Moore's story becomes less about what we are watching, and more about what we are feeling.Yet for all its intellectual benefits, emotionally engaging sentiments, and breath taking visuals, it's the story at the heart of Watchmen that makes it what it is. It's a story that manages to connect not just through the intellect, but through the heart, and through the naturally questioning soul that defines us from all other life we know. That story, which defines humanity in one fleeting image after another, exists here on the big screen as relevant and moving as ever, echoing the current social climate with vivid resonance and potency. Our struggle, symbolised simply by a cute, bright-eyed smiley face smeared with a single droplet of blood, forms the redemptive tear of a misguided and squandered race trying desperately to survive against their own tragically savage nature. It's poetic but grounded and sporadically flawed, but Watchmen nevertheless succeeds in continuing the advancement of the superhero movie into a new realm of adult entertainment fit with intellectually rewarding themes and tangible characters with more to them than tight spandex, special effects and clean-cut morals.A (heavily cut to less than 1000 words) review by Jamie Robert Ward.

Dark Heroes in a Violent and Bleak Alternate World,"In 1985, in an alternate world where Richard Nixon has been successively reelected with no Watergate, the nuclear war seems to be eminent due to the increasing tension between the United States of America and the Soviet Union. Eight years ago, the Keene Law signed by Nixon forced the early retirement of the second generation of masked vigilante superheroes known as Watchmen, but the interference of the powerful physicist Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) leading the victory of USA in Vietnam holds the ultimate nuclear attack of Soviet Union. When the former Watchmen The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is brutally murdered, his colleague Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) decides to investigate and discovers a Machiavellian conspiracy to bring worldwide peace.""Watchmen"" is an original movie about dark heroes in a violent and bleak alternate world in a Cold War environment. The plot is too complex and deserved at least a mini-series; consequently the beginning is very confused due to the numbers of simultaneous subplots together with the presentation of the characters and environment. A couple of months ago I watched the first ten minutes and I found it so messy that I decided to watch another DVD. Today a friend of mine has told me that ""Watchmen"" is a great movie and I have decided to give a second chance to this film, and I found really an excellent bleak and Machiavellian story, supported by magnificent landscapes and CGI. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Watchmen – O Filme"" (""Watchmen – The Movie"")",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Ultimately Rewarding,"I don't know if it the fanatics trying to adequately defend their beloved piece of pop culture, or the haters trying to justify why they dislike the 'hype' film of the year, but every review I have read thus far has been a sprawling three page snore-fest that is more demanding than Watchmen itself. So to that affect, I will be brief and succinct as I too try and unravel this vastly complex but ultimately rewarding crime drama.I cannot think of many more directors working today that could have handled Watchmen better then Zack Snyder, whom I am growing to love more with each film he completes, from the zombie masterpiece Dawn of the Dead to 2006's surprise hit 300, Snyder excels at creating action pieces with underlying moral messages and hidden meanings.With his third crack, he draws deep into his self-proclaimed passion of the Alan Moore Watchmen graphic novel, and essentially anchors it upon the screen, almost panel for panel. And it is too long. That being said, Watchmen is never boring and certainly never uninteresting. The opening act is visceral and tantalizing, but the following 45 minutes is muddled and ultimately unnecessary. Literature, because there is not a complimentary visual medium, must describe every element and while a graphic novel can half that effect, a movie should still leave more open to interpretation then they did ultimately. The final third is by far the best, and includes the films best scenes and dialogue which take place in a prison.The prisoner? A vigilante by the name of Rorschach (Jackie Earl Haley), who draws his name from the infamous ink blot test, personifying it by a shifting black and white mask. He is but one of a group of second generation vigilante superheroes including Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman), the godlike Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup), the proclaimed ""worlds smartest man"" Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), The Comedian (Jeffery Dean Morgan) and Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson). In retirement and in an alternate reality where Richard Nixon is still president and the American's won Vietnam, the group is haphazardly forced back into action after The Comedian is killed, and a deeper running plot is revealed. Jackie Early Haley is fantastic as the cold, unrelenting Rorschach whose quest for the absolute truth is society's blessing and his curse.While demanding during the initial viewing, I found myself pondering the morals at play and further respecting and enjoying what I had seen. I suspect this is a film where a second viewing would be advantageous, if not to understand more fully, to again admire Snyder's crisp and engrossing visuals and wholly original mystery that unfolds.7.5 / 10.0Read all my reviews at: simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"A Great Action Epic, But Nothing More","With 300, Zack Snyder had the problem of having not enough meat on the bone - Frank Miller's violent graphic novel was short and in-your-face, with director Snyder compensating by spending pretty much all of it's two hour runtime in super-slow motion. Here the problem is reversed: Alan Moore's unfilmable, complicated and very, very deep graphic novel seemed simply too dense for any director to take by the horns and be successful. Hell, even Moore himself deemed it so - so much that he disowned the film entirely.Here, Snyder has two audiences: those familiar, and those who aren't. If you're the latter, Watchmen is a masterwork of literature, telling the story of a group of masked avengers who, since outlawed, live empty and lonely lives. When one is killed in his apartment, Rorschach, who dons the famous ever-moving mask, takes it upon himself to get to the root of the real reason for the death, but stumbles onto something much larger than he could ever have expected.It really is a character piece. Each one, filled off-screen with complicated, articulate back-stories is brought to life on screen by some of the most heartfelt acting I've seen in a long time (save perhaps Malin Ackerman as the latex-wearing Silk Spectre II), particularly from Billy Crudup who plays the blue, often naked (and well-hung) demi-god who is the only superhero with real superpowers.Although the star of the show is Rorschach himself. Despite being behind a mask for the large majority of the film, Jackie Earle Haley is beyond perfect for the role. His husky voice commands the voiceovers from Rorschach's journal (recited in many cases word-for-word from the novel), and plays the psychopathic, paranoid and immensely complex role with such a force that you simply can't tear your eyes away from him.Snyder made himself known with 300 - the ultra-violent story of the Spartans who went to war (and lost miserably). However, Watchmen makes 300 seem like Mary Poppins - this has got to be one of the most violent films I have ever seen. All the book's action sequences are there, just bigger. More badass. Gory as hell. And, for some reason Snyder decided to place a porny, cringy 3 minute sex scene set to Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"" slap bang in the middle of the film. Sure, it was in the book, but it was shorter, and the soundtrack was most certainly not this poncy.However, this discrepancy is the only gripe (and this is a very minor gripe) that I have with the film. It's hard to watch in places - a rape scene here, a pregnant woman killed there - and even pulls the heartstrings in others (Doctor Manhattan's backstory most definitely (almost) brought me to tears). The book is majorly complex, deep and meaningful, and in it's transition to screen, a lot of that is lost in translation. But what we get is a fantastically artistic, fast-paced action epic. Snyder was aiming for two audiences who are polar opposites, and comes free with an adaptation of which even writer Alan Moore should be proud.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Not up to scratch,"Alan Moore's hate/hate relationship with Hollywood is common knowledge. When they adapt his work, not only does he insist that his name is taken from the credits, but he also rejects any royalties he's due. After lacklustre efforts like From Hell and V for Vendetta and the downright abysmal League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, who can blame the man? Can Zack Snyder buck the trend and adapt works that the author himself deems un-adaptable?The story, set in an alternate universe where Nixon is still President and the yanks won in Vietnam, concerns a group of out-of-work masked heroes called the Watchmen, unable to save the day due to a new law.Most have moved on, retired or found other outlets for their skills. One of them, though, refuses to stop. A man in an ink-blot mask and a Mickey Spillane trenchcoat; Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley). The closest thing to a protagonist in the film, he follows the clues after the brutal murder of another hero, the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan).In the background there are several sub-plots running concurrently. Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup), the only super-powered hero of the group is working on a self-sustaining power source to solve the world's energy needs. He's working with the world's smartest and wealthiest man, Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), who may have ulterior motives of his own.Invested in his work and removed from society by his god like powers, Dr. Manhattan is slowly losing his human empathy. The same reason his girlfriend Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman) is falling out of love with him. She finds solace in the arms of Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson) an impotent batman like hero, who barely conceals his lust for action.As the world heads towards Nuclear Disaster, the heroes must forget their differences and unite. But to save humanity from itself, sacrifices must be made.The Labyrinthine plot strands make it hard to keep track of any single story, even if you have read the book. At least when you're reading it, you can put it down for five minutes. It requires all of your brain power and a lot of enthusiasm for the story to watch the three hour long movie. So intense is it, that you actually feel yourself tiring halfway through. The first act runs for at least an hour, introducing characters and their relationships. Cutting back in time at will, to give you each one's origin story. You're left willing the film to take shape and head in one particular direction, not dozens all at once.Snyder makes a few mistakes that really jar. His use of music is poorly founded, playing entire tracks over scenes that don't need it. The over long sex scene between Nite Owl and Silk Spectre comes to mind. I mean Hallelujah by Leonard Cohen may be ironic for an impotent character finally getting it up, but it doesn't fit the mood.He also seems to splash around some random acts of extreme violence to remind the audience that this is a strictly adult Superhero movie, ensuring himself an 18 certificate. He never really finds the right tone for the movie, instead adopting them all. For instance, is it supposed to be humorous or serious? The book was so much larger than life that the irony positively dripped from the page, but here he humanises the characters too much leaving us confused.The acting is average almost all the way round. The only stand out performance was Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. A Travis Bickle character who's seen too much misery and left his humanity in the gutter. When he's captured and put in prison with so many of the criminals he put away, the film hits an all time high. The scenes strike a perfect balance between ironic humour and gritty all out violence. But I always had time for Rorschach, so maybe I'm biased.Zack Snyder can't be blamed entirely. The man obviously loves the source material and gives it his best shot. It's just clearly too big a project for him after only two films. Terry Gilliam and Paul Greengrass, both more experienced directors, have abandoned the story as unfilmable. Maybe Alan Moore was right after all.Verdict 6/10 A brilliant book, but it makes a poor film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
The best Superhero movie ever made - no exaggeration,"The characters are great with a range of powers as diverse as natural human ability.The style of the move is unique and a gorgeous work of art. Years after watching it I find myself re-watching my favourite sequences.The heroes and the villains all have logical motivations and no one is inherently evil. It is just a world as complex and fascinating as the one we live in, with the exception of powerful beings roaming the planet.This movie is not only gripping making you heavily invested in the characters, their journeys and what they are trying to achieve, but at the same time stretches your imagination of the limits of the physical world and of storytelling itself.As studios today produce more and more drivel this movie shines brighter and brighter.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"A rated ""R"" Comic Book movie great for Adults","This was (dare I say) perfect in the comic book movie genre. I absolutely loved all the characters especially Dr. Manhattan. There was a scene that certainly is not intended for children's eyes, but its not over the top, meaning I have seen worst graphic scenes in Indiana Jones, notably the villains death scenes at the end of each.They stayed true to the comics and I love the universe they created with Nixon in his 5th term in office, etc.There are a lot of flashbacks and I think flashbacks within flashbacks but its all good, it wasn't confusing to me and flashbacks within flashbacks can be very confusing if done wrong. The director did a great job wielding the story lines together in 3 1/2 hours. Superb visuals and a fantastic storyline, I was a little upset at the end of what happened to one of the characters, but hey can't have everything.I would recommend this to anyone who loves comic book movies, however this isn't like your normal comic book movies, as it is grittier and darker then most (think of Sin City or 300). It takes the genre in a different direction much like how Chris Nolan did with the recent installments of Batman (which I also love).The movie deals with current themes in our world today and for that I think this makes the movie timeless. I certainly can't think of why all the hatred for this movie. Not only did it completely stay true to the original comic, but it did this in such stylized fashion. I have decided that Zack Snyder can do no wrong.I think most people didn't like this because they thought it was boring. Well if a good story must have non-stop action then this and most movies are not for you. There is great action, yes, but there is also depth to the mythology of the Watchmen world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Hello???,"It's my own fault.Nobody forced me to watch this.At least not to the end after I realized that it is a mess made of Stupid and Boring.But I did, I guess I had nothing better to do and I'm always so curious plus I never lose hope that it might change for the better...No such luck.What an awful movie. A jumpy plot that tells uninteresting stories in various flashbacks. B O R I N G ! Well, OK, one point for the nice idea at the end.I probably hate it cause I lived through the eighties. I just couldn't get my mind round all the propaganda and crazy history-twists (plus the BAD make-up...gee, what horrible masks of Nixon etc...I shudder again at the memory).Totally useless and superfluous.I know I'm in the minority here, but hasn't anybody of the top-points-givers ever seen a good movie???",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Very ambitious and unusual,"Most all cultures have dreamed iconic hero figures since the dawn of time. Instead of doomsayers and bards, today we have graphic novels, comic books and movies, and this is a very thoughtful effort at the hero tale, very Greek in that all the heroes have their various flaws, some are quite despicable.There's too much in the movie to think about. Many of these characters and their situations deserve movies of their own. The music selected is trite. I'm no great fan of Richard Nixon, but the treatment of him and his cabinet is simultaneously tired, offensive and ignorant, making his makeup a grotesque is also gamey and needlessly politicizing. There are tons of continuity/logic issues, but none of them broke through and ruined the suspension of disbelief for me.That said, this is the best comic book hero movie I've seen. I thought Dark Knight was a snooze compared to this movie, and actually thought about issues raised in this movie's plot after viewing it, rare for such a movie. Couldn't tell you a single thing about Dark Knight other than Heath Ledger was in Dark Knight and Michael Caine sounds like Alfie. Watchmen offers more to think about.Nothing earthshaking, but certainly didn't regret spending the time or money on this entertaining movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Most underrated film!,"Snyder is a but of a mixed bag and people seem to either hate or love the guy. Regardless of how you feel about his films now, you can't say Watchmen isn't a great film.

"The fidelity should be praised, but maybe not the style","""Watchmen"" has an intro (from the first shot to the end of the opening credits) that's somehow mesmerizing. Just something about the marriage of sight and sound that I get lost in. It's dark and brutal, but it's easy to get carried along. And then Bob Dylan starts playing and it's always a stark reminder that I'm in for one hell of a soundtrack (it's incredible).It's a (mostly) entertaining movie, but it's never as good as those first few minutes. And I think that's ultimately why my enjoyment has diminished over the years (especially given its runtime). I'm usually more inclined to pick up the book instead. Zac Snyder deserves bonus points for such strict adherence to the comic book; on the other hand, there's no subtlety and he loves his slo-mo shots. Believe it or not, that can get old after awhile. Maybe that's why it works better on the page.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Watch It,"Viewed on HuluSet in an alternate version of the 1980's where superheroes exist (and thus certain historic events unfolded differently) and the government has recently passed a ban on their activity, the small crop of heroes left must decide whether or not to break it after it's revealed that someone is murdering former heroes one by one in a conspiracy that may lead to nuclear war.It's dark, gritty, and very much a slow burn kind of watch that feels like the antithesis to the rock a minute family films that most superhero movies have been in the past decade. The lore & characters are deep & interesting, with my only issue being that it might be perhaps a bit too much for the runtime of a movie. It's by no means confusing if you're paying attention (it really is admirable how well it's held together), but it feels like the movie really only touches the surface of what this world provides.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

The best superhero movie of all time!,"Probably my one of my all time favorite super hero movies! This is such an iconic, and probably the BEST graphic comic book novel of all time. Once again, Mr. Zack Snyder did such a wonderful job with this superhero movie. This movie is just way too awesome for the big screen. I enjoyed this movie a lot, I may watch it again, i don't know. Every single actor in this movie did amazing. Definitely worth seeing guys! Got check it out!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Watchmen is a cinematic masterpiece,"Amazing film. Bringing a graphic novel as layered and complex as the Watchmen to the screen is no easy task and Snyder did a brilliant job. Watchmen was as unconventional, intellectual, cerebral, and unique to the cinema world as much as the graphic novel was to the comic book world. It's hard to not compare this to the novel but as a film it is brilliant. Zack Snyder truly did the story justice. Look around online at where other filmmakers before him wanted to take the film. There was even one script where they updated it to be in present day and have the threat be from terrorists. Snyder single handedly saved the Watchmen from a cinematic nightmare. He had the script reworked into the closest adaptation of any graphic novel to date. I would like to shake his hand and thank him for being one of the few filmmakers these days that actually cares about being faithful to the source material of film adaptations. Beyond being faithful, Snyder brought an amazing style and vision to the project. He brought an independent film sensibility to a big budget picture which not many people have the guts to do. I don't think enough can be said on what a great job he did.I think some of the complaints people have about this movie is interesting because they are very contradictory. Some say the film is too short and some say it's too long. Some say that the movie suffers from sticking too close to the book and others say it's from not sticking close enough to the book. From beginning to end I can't say there wasn't a single moment when I checked the time. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of this film. I also speak from a fan's perspective when I say that this movie is probably the closest adaptation of a comic book to date. Yeah there are some details left out but there are already people complaining about the length. Imagine how many people would complain if this movie actually had every single thing from the book in it. It would be like five hours long! The fact of the matter is that the spirit and the heart of the book is definitely present in every moment of the movie.Some people are also complaining about the music used in the film. With exception of maybe a song or two I loved the soundtrack. Since the film is a period piece, and these characters are such a big part of American history from the 1950's on, it makes sense to blend the music of the times into these characters lives. This is the story of what would happen in our world if these characters existed in it. In our world music is very tied into our history. I just really don't see the big deal. I think it's just because people aren't used to hearing this sort of music in this genera. Again this just goes to show that this movie dares to be different from the rest.I think the problem for the non fans of the book is that they just thought this was going to be another X Men. THIS IS NOT THE X MEN or is it any other super hero film you have ever seen before. This is risk taking super hero story. It's got the spirit of an independent film. It is truly unique. I saw some parents brought children to see this film. Wow great parenting. This isn't a movie for children. It has extremely graphic and gruesome violence. It has sex and nudity. Watchmen earns it's R rating. Yeah it still has the action and the fight scenes audiences have come to expect from a super hero movie and they are certainly impressive. Unlike other super hero films though the action scenes aren't what drives the story. This is a character piece. The film, like the novel, takes it's time developing the complex history of the characters and the world they live in. Each character is so rich and unique that it's very hard to find a favorite. The actors are perfectly cast to bring these characters to life. It's as though they are jumping out of the pages of the book.Watchmen is definitely under appreciated and under rated. It's a shame that mainstream audiences didn't really seem to get it. Then again these are the same people that made Transformers 2 one of the biggest hits of the summer so it's almost a compliment that they didn't get it. Like Fight Club, Donnie Darko, and The Fountain, Watchmen will find attention from a more intellectual group of people that can actually appreciate all of the nuances, philosophy, and social commentary that this film has to offer. Apparently this is too smart and cerebral for the typical audience member. Watchmen dared to be different in a time when most films are afraid to challenge conventions. Films used to be praised for that. Apparently not any more. If this came out ten years ago it probably would have met more success but these days people don't want to think at the movies. They just want conventional and simple. It's a shame but I have a feeling that Watchmen will find a larger audience on DVD. It is an experience that should not be missed. It's the freshest super hero story ever told.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"""I'm Leaving This Galaxy for Something a Little Less Complicated""","A nostalgic return to an alternative 1985 in which Richard Nixon was still president, Ronald Reagan considering a run for the White House was dismissed as laughable and all we had to worry about was nukes in the hands of commies rather than Mad Vlad.As usual it takes itself too seriously, doesn't live up to the terrific title sequence, gets very garrulous and goes on for far too long; but still makes you realise how lacking in wit and style most other superhero movies are.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Doesn't hold a candle to the novel, but Snyder understood ""The Big Joke""","The undeniably brilliant & beautiful graphic novel masterpiece about the archetypical conflict of the ""superhero"" :""saving the world"", inevitable war, and the human condition is now an enjoyable, but not ""perfectly"" competent film adaptation.For those who didn't read the book: ""Watchmen"" is set in an alternate universe where Nixon serves under a 3rd term in 1985, battling the Soviets despite impending worldwide thermonuclear holocaust...The film follows washed-up formerly-masked vigilantes who were all active until they were forced by the gov't to retire in the Keene Act of '77.Though the film leaves out a significant amount of information & emotional scenes of certain characters that the book contains, such as,Laurie Jupiter,Rorschach & the New Yorkers surrounding the ""Gunga Diner"", Snyder obviously read the book & although he watered down some emotionally gripping scenes or left them out completely; he understood the *primary"" point of ""Watchmen"" Humanity's ""Big Joke""....These superheros goal is to ""save the world""...But will the world let them? Is chaos inevitable? Do perfectly moral masked saviors really exist?""Rorschach"" :a mysterious, monotonous hero in a trench coat fedora & earie moving ""Rorschach"" blotted mask that is still ""active"" even after the Keen Act, therefore a much feared fugitive, merciless interrogator ; never spares evil-doers, fights viciously to punish the amoral & he never surrenders even in the face of Armageddon. He's a crusader for black & white justice. Black white forces bouncing off of each other, NEVER mixing of grey as Rorschach says, the mask is his ""face"".""The Comedian"" is a ""superhero"" ""war hero"" with sadistic tendencies who sets the stage for the film's themes in the beginning, as well as the very end.He really just fights evil for something to ""fight"", he knows humans will inevitably kill each other off, and chooses to revel in the chaos.Then there is ""Dr. Manhattan"" a REAL superhuman...An indestructible immortal nuclear force who can do virtually *anything*, manipulate basic physics that were once thought to be written in stone...He is fighting for America, yet the Soviets are not surrendering..The world is proving The Comedian right.Also due to his condition of no longer being a ""normal"" human,due to tragic circumstances, he becomes unmotivated to defend humanity.He no longer sees the value in humans.The only retired hero who seems to genuinely care about the world, and promises to end all wars is the retired-hero & self-made millionaire Adrian ""Ozymandias"" Veidt...He is also the only retired hero with the most positive public image, selling action figures & other self-endorsing merchandise.He's a hero we can completely trust & believe in...Or is he? This film is a rather difficult one to review...I've read the graphic novel before watching this film adaptation which is probably the BEST way to enjoy & understand the film and the movie's opening & ending are the perfect interpretations of the book.In the middle, it meanders a bit and isn't paced too well IMO...However as adaptations go, I can tell the filmmakers truly understood the book & interpreted it accurately save for, as I mentioned earlier, the strong emotional impact the book provokes.Even if you didn't read the book, this is definitely an enjoyable film, never a dull moment, and you may not look @ the superhero genre the same way again.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"If it ain't broke, please don't remake it...","If I was Alan Moore, right now, I would feel somewhat like ""The Comedian"". I would be laughing at the great joke that Watchman turned out to be.Alan Moore was right. There are certain things a comic book or graphic novel can do that film cannot. I'm a film follower first. It is a much more entertaining medium, after all a movie reads for me. And there is a lot a film CAN do that is impossible to recapture in any other art form, such as songwriting, painting, etc. But the story of the Watchmen was never meant to be lifted from its pages to the big screen.Their are just too many details a comic can preserve in front of you, transfixed long enough to be studied so the smallest detail can become aware. A movie cannot do this.In a comic, it is accepted to survey several backstories of multiple characters at a time. One cannot be overwhelmed this way, because a READER can stop, flip back a few pages and review the material that they were just being asked to accept. If you are having a hard time keeping up with the parallels between the old and new ""Minutemen"" flip back a couple pages and read it again. If you didn't quite understand Dr. Manhattan's conversation on Mars and its irony concerning time and human matters, you can stop and allow time for insight.VIEWERS do not have this pleasure. When a viewer is forced to absorb four flashbacks, one on top of the other, the movie's time line degrades and the viewer loses interest.Again when the comic book series came out was what made the series so revolutionary. It was a time in comic book history where the biggest problem a superhero had was who was robbing Chase Manhattan today. Alan Moore stepped in and gave real lives to his fictional comic book characters. These characters lived and breathed, they drank when they were unhappy, they had sex, they even had bad breath in the morning. They had something no other comic book personalities shared. Flaws.The world was not ready for a Watchmen movie. The average movie-goer is not yet bored with the same superhero movie paradigm. They still want to see more special effects and wire-fu especially over something as menial as story, right? A comic book reader, or reader in general, has nothing to look forward to but the story and its substance. It is easier to put down a book than walk out of a theater.But Snyder did his best to appease the average superhero movie senses. There is a lot of bone crunching and neck breaking action. And the entire movie looks great and is directed like it was from somebody on top of their game, because it was. This movie looks, sounds, and watches just fine. It just looks, sounds, and READS better. The fact that Hollywood had to change the ending of the book goes to show the comic never should have made a film debut.Ironic enough Hollywood fought and fought to keep the rights from going to Alan Moore and his company. After witnessing the crowd's response to the film tonight, I have a feeling Moore is not going to have too much trouble getting the rights now.What was the icing on this cake of sheer irony is the song that exits the film. Desolation Row is a song hailed to be one of the better Dylan songs of his whole songwriting career. The fact that it was perverted by ""My Chemical Romance"" of all bands, just proves a point I've been trying to make: some things should not be meddled with.(this was piece is presented raw and not proof read.

Stylized with a Relevant Message,"This is a movie that I sought out when it came out in the theater. I was in college. The trailer had me hyped up that I saw this opening night and then again later that week. I enjoyed it so much that it made me purchase the graphic novel and read it as well. Jaime and I watched it as I thought it would be a 'comic book' movie that she would be interested in.To give a bit of synopsis here, this takes place in 1985. It also goes into the past to explain the world we are in and the characters' pasts. This is an alternative timeline. Due to a mishap with an experiment, Jon Osterman (Billy Crudup) becomes Dr. Manhattan. He is made from a form of nuclear energy where he can see his past, present and future simultaneously. This causes him to lose touch with reality with his only grip being his girlfriend, Laurie Jupiter (Malin Akerman). These two met as they were part of a vigilante group of masked heroes known as the Watchmen. Her alias was like her mother, Silk Spectre II.In this world, we are on the brink of nuclear war being the United States and Soviet Union. Dr. Manhattan has been the best deterrent even going as far to win the war in Vietnam and allowing Richard Nixon (Robert Wisden) to be elected to a third term. There is a chain of events happening in New York though. It starts with an intruder killing Edward Blake (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) who was the Comedian. He was part of the Minute Men with Laurie's mother, Sally (Carla Gugino) who was Silk Spectre as well. Comedian was also part of the Watchmen with Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley), Adrian Veidt (Matthew Goode) who went by Ozymandias. There was also Dan Dreiberg (Patrick Wilson) who was the second Nite Owl.That should be enough information to give you a gist of what is happening. What I'll say is that I love the graphic novel and I know must prefer it. It allows it to do more things as well as go deeper into the social commentary that Dave Gibbons was using it for. Jaime had an issue where characters are introduced with no explanation until later. I was able to fill in the blanks a bit until she settled in. There is a lot here and they're trying to get through a lot which makes sense. I don't see it as an issue, but I can see how others do.With that established now as well, I do want to say that I love the social commentary. Being set in this different 1985 that is embracing capitalist and not having the US look at itself due to the imperialist thoughts of Vietnam and Korean wars is interesting. It is sinking into being dirty and corruption. We've been on top of the world with Dr. Manhattan which isn't too far off with our military power. This just gives us that extra power. Adrian wants to introduce a new clean energy with the help of Dr. Manhattan, but there are powerful people that don't want him to. They want to continue to rely on fossil fuels. That checks out even today. The social relevance when this was written and how it still fits it amazing as well as sad.To then shift over to the filmmaking, I think that we have a great cast of characters. Haley's darkness as Rorschach is great. I love Crudup's indifference as Dr. Manhattan. Goode's arrogance as Ozymandias works as does Morgan's cynical nature. Then there's Akerman who looks great and fits as Laurie. I like Wilson in this oddly nerdy role for someone as good looking as him. We also have the likes of Gugino, Matt Fewer and even Stephen McHattie in a smaller role. This is all good in my opinion. I'd say the cinematography is stylized in the way that Zack Snyder does it. This is CGI heavy, but also see that it must be. It holds up for the most part. Another big thing is that this has a great soundtrack which I appreciate.Despite this not being a perfect movie, I enjoy it. I think that it has good social commentary under the surface. It is a grounded take on the superhero movie. Even though it has a long runtime, I know there are aspects left out. There is just too much there which I think upsets fans. This is bordering on great for me if I'm honest here and would recommend giving it a viewing.My Rating: 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Believe the Hype,"The Watchmen, a semi-dynastic group of superheroes with all of the emotional, psychological and even philosophical problems of the rest of earth's human population, has been, essentially, washed up. In his third term as president, and on the verge of WWIII with the Soviet Union, President Richard Nixon has banned super-heroism. Some turn to alcoholism (The Comedian), roguish skulking (Rorschach) or resignation and depression (Nite Owl II) while others exploit and explore their abilities in new ways (Ozymandias and Dr. Manhattan). Yet somebody is going out of their way to hunt them down, one by one. Will the seemingly unbalanced Rorschach succeed in reuniting The Watchmen to prevent nuclear holocaust and to defend themselves against their unknown enemy, and more importantly - WHY are they being picked off one by one and by whom?Loaded with irony, strong characterization and a cleverly spun plot, The Watchmen is very much worth seeing. The performances are generally very good, though I thought that Matthew Goode's interpretation of Ozymandias was a little too predictable and stereotyped. Billy Crudup and Patrick Wilson were stand-outs for me. Malin Akerman was fine, but not really challenged by her role. The effects are appropriate and never over-bearing and the script is much better than average. Well-directed and edited and very well shot, there are only a few unnecessary scenes in this lengthy film.Unlike many comic book or graphic novel films, the pace of The Watchmen is far from frenetic. Its pace is exactly that of a noir film. Some will figure out who is pulling the strings early on, but will almost certainly be unable to discern why and how. Many more will have a hard time following the film since, like many noir adventures, its course is not really established until it is too late to stop or even impede it. Rorschach, upon whom most of the first half of the film really revolves, provides the complementary angry, ironic and fast-talking' voice-over to complete the noir atmosphere.Surprisingly, despite the nihilism which underlies so much of the noir genre and was so penetratingly palpable during the real-world cold war, the film ends up being as much about ideological conflict, duality, problems of perspective, and philosophy as it is about millennial adventure. And if you walk away questioning your own concepts of good and evil and the place of humanity in all things, you've paid attention in the open and thoughtful manner the film really demands.Highly recommended for people with good attention spans. Not recommended for others.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

my t-shirt was Roarschached with saliva of amazement,"If Zack Snyder wasn't interested in pop culture (comic books, zombies, ninjas, dragons...), it would probably be considered as the best director of our time.

I loved mister Snyder's work but I thought the adaptation was impossible.Well it wasn't.

"More ""Scorsese"" than ""Superman""","Watchmen is based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. The movie takes place in an alternate time-line. Set in 1985, and at the brink of nuclear war, Watchmen will either force you to be open-minded and accept this alternate reality, or reject the very idea of such an outlandish plot-line.The characters are unique and very human. They make Wolverine (usually considered a brash and thuggish superhero,) look like Clark Kent. Our vigilante crew lacks superpowers , but they make up for it with attitude and maxi. Each member of the Watchmen are very different, so chances are you will end up loving at least one, and hating another.The movie's opening credits are the real winner here. Set to Bob Dylan's ,The Times They Are A-Changin', you will be hooked from the first second. The colors, costumes, and ""wax museum look-a-like still scenes"" will mesmerize you. Don't Blink!!!The movie is rated R and rightfully so. Parents should not let their kiddies partake in this orgy of blood, sex, nudity (both male and female,) and violence. This is no Fantastic Four!!! Watchmen is definitely more Scorsese than Superman!!!At just over 2 hours, the movie's plot and ending lose a little clarity due to the time restraints, but not much. If for nothing else but the colorful scenes and fantastic soundtrack, I would say give Watchmen a try. And if you actually like violence, sex, and superheroes, and haven't yet seen the movie- What the hell are you waiting for??? The movie's music and scenes will stick in your head for days, and you will want to watch it again and again. I already have!!!!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
This could have been better with a few less deviations from the book but it is still a masterpiece and must see,"Watchmen (2009) is an Alan Moore classic that is in my DVD collection that I recently watched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows America and a society that has people with special powers. While initially the people with powers seem like super heroes it becomes apparent they have their own struggles and eventually are forced to retire. When these super heroes start getting murdered they get back together and try to figure what is going on and why.This movie is directed by Zack Snyder (300) and stars Jackie Earle Haley (Shutter Island), Patrick Wilson (Insidious), Carla Gugino (American Gangster), Matthew Goode (The Imitation Game), Jeffrey Dean Morgan (The Walking Dead) and Matt Frewer (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids).This movie does a fairly good job of delivery the appropriate look and feel of Moore's classic comic book. There's a few deviations that were moderately frustrating, but overall the cinematography and action scenes are very well executed and makeup for it. There's wonderful violence and gore throughout this film and a brutal rape scene. The movie is perfectly cast and there's strong performances by everyone involved. I loved the delivery of the characters and how they were developed. There were many good subplots, smart dialogue and entertaining interactions. The ending is absolutely brilliant.Overall this could have been better with a few less deviations from the book but it is still a masterpiece and must see. I would score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
One of the Best Superhero Movies there is,"I find it interesting (and, to be honest, quite satisfying in a 'I was right' kind of way 😁) to see the number of reviews of this film that are now rating it highly.From a personal point of view this film has been in my top 5 ever films since it was first made. It's a brilliant piece of work showing us a whole new side to the superhero genre and asking the big question - 'What would a superhero actually be like once you factor in human nature'? A scary thought.It's clever, thought provoking, frightening, funny, exciting, sad, challenging and many other things all at the same time.I understand people's point of view when they say it was ahead of its time and I think they are right. The film is ripe for modern times now. It is truly relevant to the modern world.

The only 10 of 10 I have given,"I was looking at the various superhero movies Snyder has done and I came back to this title. I am sure it isn't perfect, but I can't personally find a flaw. I don't know the source material so it was a seamless story to me. I have shown this and the Directors cut to various friends over the years to universal approval.I would say the fantastic soundtrack is going to get more traction with younger Boomers and Gen Xers but that is maybe part of the appeal as current superhero films don't target these groups. Its weird and unique IMO and certainly Snyder's best work.A pity there was not enough money made to generate a sequel but that has prevented the legacy from being tainted unlike what happened to the Hellboy series.If you know someone who thinks all superhero movies are ""a type"" and has no use for the overpopulated MCU universe, this is something to show them.

A Richly Compelling Experience,"I was skeptical about Zack Snyder as a director before this film. I hated the Dawn of the Dead remake and I thought that 300 was simply an exercise in style and technical mastery with everything else lathered on top. Roughly two hours prior to seeing this film for the first time, I listened to David Edelstein give his review on NPR, saying that Snyder, in showing reverence to the material's roots as a graphic novel, keeps the camera as still as possible and drains the life out of the film. I don't just disagree with Edelstein. I doubt he and I saw the same film. The movie I saw was a masterpiece of spectacle, a liberation of Hollywood style, a richly textured, densely layered epic that boldly inverts all the conventions of superhero movies and comic books.Due to the American victory in the Vietnam War as a result of commissioning two superheroes, Dr. Manhattan and The Comedian, to fight for the U.S., Richard Nixon is shown to be elected to his third term as President. By 1985, however, he has outlawed masked vigilantes and rising Cold War tensions with the Soviet Union threaten a devastating nuclear war. The film begins in the apartment of Edward Blake, whose identity is revealed soon after his brutal murder. Following this is one of the most inventive and mesmerizing opening credits sequences I have ever seen, a montage of historical scenes painting, almost literally, an alternate history from World War II through the 1980s involving masked heroes. The montage plays ""Times They Are A-Changin'"" sung by Bob Dylan, and includes implicit twists on historical events such as JFK's assassination.The whodunit of the Comedian's death begins to piece together with a global masterplan. The first phase in the plot may be to eradicate the Watchmen. Unlike the Superman films, for instance, Watchmen understands that it's difficult to profit from the complete devastation of the planet, but there was a nuclear deadlock between the U.S. and the Soviet Union that pressured precisely that.The ensemble cast of superheroes (almost outnumbered by the amount of bit players prosthetically masquerading as iconic people of the times) are clad in classic comic book costumes. Rorshach's cloth mask, with its constantly fluctuating inkblots, is one of the most fascinating superhero garbs ever, always in constant motion, telegraphing his black-and- white view of the world, and how his views shift depending on the overriding emotion of his given mood.When I say that I was skeptical of Snyder before, I mean that I felt he didn't quite understand cinema enough to be at the helm of such visionary contributions to it. Dawn of the Dead is screamingly pretentious and 300 is beautiful but shallow. But Watchmen not only leaves such an indelible stylistic impression, but also protects its vision with a certain wisdom concerning starpower. There is hardly a name actor in the film. The most well-known faces in the film are scarce: Billy Crudup is masqueraded entirely in an computer-generated image for the vast majority of his screen time; Carla Gugino has little screen time at all save for scenes that span her character's vast differences in age pertaining to the story. Snyder impresses me here, because he understands that casting major stars in these roles would allow the audience to project their own assumptions of a superstar's persona onto his or her character. And he doesn't want that. He wants these very unique characters to flourish in their own right, and for the actors to serve them, not the other way around.The Watchmen and their distinguished endowments are all the better capable of seeing how weak they really are, and granting all but Dr. Manhattan are human and on the same side, their capabilities are not infinite. Dr. Manhattan, living apart from time and space, is reasonably detached from the future of our infinitesimal planet.Watchmen has a philosophy of time and space that is strikingly similar to that of Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five. Dr. Manhattan observes his peers knowingly, having learned through his universal superpowers that everything simultaneously exists. Each ""superhero"" is deeply flawed, and their effect on the world can hardly be said to be more positive than negative, or more negative than positive. Their effect simply is. By the end, the Diabolical Masterplan that has been discovered is something that Manhattan claims to understand ""without condoning...or condemning."" There is hardly a way to argue against it, even though one knows how monstrous it is. Such dilemmas preoccupy all the Watchmen, and are exhibited in a film experience of unique, arresting beauty. It might seem unlikely to take solemnly a naked blue man, indeed afforded a penis though no discernible testicles, but Billy Crudup brings a moody distance to Dr. Manhattan that is oddly poignant. Does he recall how it felt to be human?Watchmen brings remarkable persuasion to these characters. There is even an unsuccessful attempt by two superheroes to have sex, something to which all humans can relate. One masked avenger is a product of superhero rape. I suppose it's needless to say that the film is exuberant enough to be seen more than once. The more one sees it, the more one has to say about it. It's difficult to master all the niceties and connotations, but also difficult not to have a compelling event.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Not Bad, but  Please read the Graphic Novel it's much, much Better","Watchmen centers around a variety of very human super heroes. After a death of a common friend, they all must meet up again and try and unearth a possible criminal plot.Watchmen is not a complete waste. This is a very faithful adaptation of the Stellar Grahpic Novel, but it manages to loose most of the life of the book. The characters are fairly interesting and unlike most super heroes but as a movie of the book and as a movie in general it isn't particularly great. The only thing that saves it from complete failure is the quality of the subject matter is is based on.It becomes clear very early that Zack Snyder was not the right man for this job. Virtually all he did was directly put most of the graphic novel onto the screen with no directing technique and then what he added/changed was very weird or just plain bad. If you saw 300 you understand his method of directing: Slow down violence to make it really cool and meaningful. Unfotunately all this does it make it seem very melodramatic and out of place. If the material he were adapting weren't so good he would have completely blown it (Again, 300). But, I do have to give him credit for how little he changed, and for the most part he cut out what he should have.The acting is kind of a mix bag. At times it's decent(Jackie Earle Haley) at other times it's awful (Malin Ackerman). So I wouldn't say the acting is out right bad, but it's certainly not Oscar worthy. But it's not always the actors' fault, I found some of the casting to be outright mind boggling: Matthew Goode as Ozymandis (WHAT?). I found Patrick Wilson to be a little to young and skinny to be Night Owl as well.It's hard for me to be that objective as I read the book first, but this movie just doesn't seem to get the same meaning and feeling as the graphic novel did. It doesn't appear that Snyder took appropriate time and care in making this a very cohesive movie. Many scenes seem very out of place and some are just ridiculous (Richard Nixon anyone?). The violence seemed gratuitous and unnecessary oftentimes, as did the sex scene.So, if your never going to read the graphic novel then see this just so you know the story as it is very interesting and original.

Not a great film in and of itself but a very good physical reproduction of the book,"With something like this it is always worth knowing what the viewer knows of Watchmen in order to contextualise the opinions one gets. For example I would like to know if you own every possible edition of Watchmen and read it once a week and twice in the week you go to the annual Watchmen convention. Conversely did you not know it was based on anything and just went into this screening because you missed the start of Bride Wars by ten minutes and worried you would not be able to follow it. These things matter they don't mean anyone is right and wrong, but it has meaning. For example, for me, I like the comic book. Not enough to get snotty about people not calling it a graphic novel, but I enjoyed it, thought the plot and characters were interesting and thought that it did work well as a comic with the additional text sections providing a lot to the panels.I found that I quite liked the film then, because it sticks close to the book, and the book is of value and quality. Some things are dropped, some things done differently and some things changed but it doesn't impact much on the film, although I'm sure the message boards will be rammed with people who disagree. The problem with this is that the film itself is not great as a film which is how the majority of people will be coming to it. It sticks so closely to the source material that the characters retain a certain lack of depth that comes with it. Sure, they do everything required within the original material but they also feel a bit limited by it as well and end up a little stiff as a result. In line with this, the film also has a very serious edge that comes over as being a bit ponderous rather than anything else. This is a shame but it does generally come as a result of how fearful the film seems to be of moving too far from the source. Film is a different media from the graphic novel and it should be different in terms of how it does the same things (at least a little).Limited to the panels in the strip, Synder doesn't really manage to explore the themes and make the most of some aspects of the story and characters. The moral and physiological make-ups of our ""heroes"" are not really explored or developed so much as they are laid out in a few moments. This is similar to the book of course but what works there doesn't work as well here because this moving, flowing version required a bit more development that we got. Likewise, other than making sure the film looks like an alternative 1980's and that the politicians look like Nixon, Kissinger etc, it doesn't do anything with the setting in terms of satire or commentary. Again this will not bother those looking for a straight reproduction of the film (although if you're that petty then the other changes will) but it does feel like it is all missing and I'm guessing that the casual viewer will wonder what the fuss is all about because there seems to be lots of characters and lots of plot but that it is all lacking depth and frankly takes itself all a bit seriously considering how stiff it is.Synder's direction is good visually though and for me I enjoyed being told a story I was already familiar with but on a big screen with the characters brought to life. OK he doesn't develop much of it but it still looks good and packs a punch. Occasionally he makes bad visual decisions (the sex scene in particular is awful) but mostly he is faithful and reproduces the material well. The use of music, it must be said, is awful. Not the songs themselves (they are good) but how they are used  when they work it is only because what they are over is working despite of the music (the opening credits are great even if the Dylan song is clunkingly obvious) but mostly they are just dropped onto the film without any impact other than being a recognisable song  many do not fit in terms of tone or period and it is jarring throughout.Generally it must be said that the performances are solid rather than impressive. Most of them fit the characters well and it suggests this was the aim of the casting process because in this regard it worked. Haley is a good Rorschach. OK his narration is limited in terms of material and delivery but both still work and he was the Rorschach I have in my head. The moral simplicity of his character does make his job easier though in the same way as Morgan's Comedian and Crudup's Manhattan are ""easier"" to deliver straight. Akerman, Goode, Wilson, Gugino and a few others are not as fortunate though because their characters are more complex but they do not have the freedom to move within their material to show this or explore this. As a result they come off looking a lot stiffer even though they are no better or worse than the others. Again the main fault probably lies with Synder because one gets the impression that his direction of their performances was to point at the animated panels and say ""do that"".So as a moving, live-action reproduction of the animated sections of the book it is perfectly fine and I enjoyed it. However as a film it is only OK because it is limited by the lack of development and exploration of themes and characters, seemingly led by the fear of messing with the material to any great extent. Far from the classic many are hailing but yet also not the piece of rubbish that many will say when the backlash begins in earnest.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Lose/Lose situation turns out to be neutral feeling,"Meh, is pretty much what I can say about this. I finally sat down and watched this. I had only read the graphic novel a few years before at the beckon of comic obsessed friends of mine but found myself really enjoying it.This movie was a direct and literal conversion with a C+ cast, because you really can't call this an ""interpretation"" of the book as it was a graphic novel. So it wasn't really up to anyone to ""turn it into a film"", merely animate the pages, so as far as that goes: Mission accomplished. However, the pacing, casting, music and cinematography are the elements that the film version had carte blanche to work with so that's what in the end defines my verdict and all I have to say is: Meh.The Pacing was too slow making the film overly long, the music was adequate as was the cinematography/CGI and the cast was a mix of B and C actors, so the result was some hit or miss dramatic cues and a very clunky and robotic feel to the whole thing. It's hard to not seem biased as a fan of the book and the way it happened in my mind while reading look at it the novel, but it just seemed like everyone was just sort playing the part as a, to borrow some lore, Vulcan would, logical straight to the point and zero deviation, which at the pace chosen would have come as a welcome surprise no matter how minute.I would have preferred a more film noir ""Sin City"" sort of take on the pacing and cinematography to the bare minimum we got to just essentially animate the pages. It's watchable but not if you want to be VERY entertained.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Looking at and past the divisiveness, so I can see more","Among all films adapted from the world of comic books or graphic novels, this one has been considered one of the most divisive of them all, however, among the divisiveness I believe there is still something quite enjoyable and entertaining about this film. The divisiveness is understandable and I can get while people give this film a hard time. One of most commonly heard reasons behind the divisiveness is its faithfulness to the graphic novel or attempt at it. While there are maybe some problems with it, I can't help but admire some the positives in it.I have to admire Zack Snyder with his effort to make this adaptation a reality. Comic book and graphic novels are not always very easy to do so, especially when it comes to something as highly regarded as Watchmen. I admit that I saw the film first before reading the graphic novel, but it did give me push to go and read it. The graphic novel is one of the best things I've read- massive complexity to its plot, thematic depth, dark/gritty comic book world, interesting use of colors, and dimensional characters. A lot of these elements can be seen in the Snyder's film adaptation- some are achieved while others are partially done, yet we also get some of Snyder's distinct cinematic style adding a new element to this adventurous adaptation. Going back to the general complaint about the film being ""too faithful"" to its original source material, I find that partially true. While the majority of the film does greatly resemble the graphic novel on a visual and narrative standpoint but does stray away some. The graphic novel is full of thought provoking themes and ideas the story involves itself with each page you flip to next, however, Snyder's film does try to invoke those same elements I mentioned a second ago, but only goes to a short distance when telling them. Another way of saying it could be that it's only on the surface level rather than wanting to dive deeper. Another thing I would like to mention since we live in the time of Marvel's Cinematic Universe, Watchmen doesn't try to sugar coat itself or lessen the darkness of it simply to fit a wider audience- mainly family and kid oriented target audiences. Just because it comes from a comic book doesn't mean it needs to sacrifice what made it so infamous and groundbreaking in order to fit a traditional formulated type film so that it pleases a general audience/make a quick buck.Snyder manages to find a way to somewhat balance itself in its plot in order to get as much of Moore's original storyline but not feel like its leaving out too much or obviously rushing. The color I will say does tend to differ a lot from the graphic novel, in which it appears more colorful while the film goes for a more darker tone in the sense of color with the occasional pop of color(mainly from Dr. Manhattan). Following Zack Snyder's trademark use of slow motion, several moments in the film are enhanced by the visually impressive technique allow audiences(more for those who have read the graphic novel) to mentally visualize moments from the graphic novel as if they literally leaped out of their panels/coming alive. Production value exceeds very well in capturing the right look and feel of the world the Watchmen inhabit. Like any other comic book related film, when it comes down to the costumes and outfits for the characters there are a lot to consider or discuss. In the case of this film, the costumes for some characters remain identical to the original graphic novel's designs drawn by Dave Gibbons, while others were changed, some of it border-lining on campiness, yet it doesn't feel like it's done without good taste. The major addition to the film by Zack Snyder was the opening title sequence, which I found to be such an immersive visual tool throwing the audience directly into the world they are about to see. Not just the sheer visual images being presented on the screen are immersive, but Bob Dylan's song ""The Times They Are A-Changin"" perfectly compliments each moment in the sequence showing that times are changing both literally and metaphorically. This sequence I'm glad is in the film and strongly believe that the film wouldn't be same without it.The main ensemble cast consisting of Jackie Earle Haley, Billy Crudup, Malin Akerman, Patrick Wilson, Matthew Goode, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan- come together to bring their characters to life right out of the graphic novel. The one character I'm most impressed with and found to be an awesome portrayal was Dr. Manhattan played by Billy Crudup. Out of the main characters Dr. Manhattan is by far my favorite of the Watchmen. There's such a rich emotional complexity and depth to the character, which Crudup completely immersed himself as that god-like figure struggling to balance his humanity and intellectual understanding. I think throughout the film a considerate amount of time was given to developing Dr. Manhattan character, which gave us the opportunity to see all his dimensions(sides). Besides the performance itself, the effort put into making Dr. Manhattan visually impressive as he comes off as an actual person/character on the screen rather than appear as just another one of many visual effects.Watchmen is definitely something to admire about when it comes to adapting such an infamous piece of work from another medium. Again it does not completely matchup to Alan Moore and Davie Gibbon's graphic novel, but it does have a good number of positive qualities worth cheering about.

"There was a good reason they called the novel ""unfilmable""","Watchmen. My favorite book of all time. One of the most famous graphic novels ever written. Its depth and meaningfulness almost unbearably grand. And who was chosen to direct the film adaptation? Zack Snyder. The guy who became famous for remaking ""Dawn of the Dead"" and directing ""300"". Now, don't get me wrong, I quite enjoyed both these films, but couldn't anybody see who unsuitable he is to make ""Watchmen""? His films were visually outstanding but none of them had the plot and character depth that ""Watchmen"" required.I first saw the trailer the second it emerged on the internet. The shots were promising but nothing was really revealed. A smart trick that made me pay 8 to watch it. But from the first scenes I realized I was in for a very disappointing treat. First I want to point out that Snyder did get some things right. The detailed sets that portrayed Alan Moore's alternate 1980's were really well made and so were the character's costumes. But it seems that after the director took care of these two, started derailing from the graphic novel.I really do not know where to start with what was wrong. The characters, although reciting extracts from the novel, had lost their depth and became marionettes, traveling from one ""visually majestic"" shot to the other. The film became really violent and gory and I really don't mind that, I've seen much worse, but the violence simply didn't seem to fit. It was pointless and graphically shot in a similar way to Zack Snyder's previous films without though serving any cause. Many important scenes were savagely shortened in order to make the fighting scenes longer. Rorschach's narration, although extracted from the book, was turned into another cliché, low-voice, tough guy narration, that reminded me of so many other films like Sin City and The Spirit. The plot was also inexplicably changed in so many ways that distorted almost every single one of the book's messages.Zack Snyder did not shoot the novel's adaptation. He just used the atmosphere and alternate reality created by the genius of Alan Moore to create his own piece of visual extravaganza and use its background to promote it. And just to make things clear, this film was not just a bad adaptation of the novel. It was a really disappointing film in general, and my friends who have not read the book agree with me. His three hour ""epic"" is visually amazing just like ""300"" was, but simply does not work with the plot.

This is what superhero movies should be,"The rating is for the Director's ultimate cut. It is a brash movie unafraid to break the mold. It is very thought provoking and deals with various subject matters without derailing the movie to focus on to them. The alternate world is beautifully crafted, the characters feel ""real"" and their motives and interpersonal relationships also feel realistic. If you are burned out by the flashy light comedy-simple plots superhero action movies this is a must watch. I wish there were more movies like these.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Liking it better each time I see it,"I'll start by saying, I'm going to soon, but I haven't read the graphic novel yet. Also I got into this bass akwords, first watching the watchmen series (was it HBO.) and being confused but liking it a lot. Then later saw this film. Liked it, and it filled in some blanks for me. Liked it a lot. Missed a lot. Saw it another time, liked it better, and third time I really, really got into it.But I am mainly writing this review in response to so many that love the graphic novel and were disappointed in this film. I got to wondering, when I was a kid, and even now, when I read a graphic novel, or comic book, I spend time...reading the dialogue and narrative, looking at the panels, the artwork, drinking it in. Slowly.
That is the antithesis of a movie, and specially this one. This moves along very fast. Back and forth in time, much like a panel in a graphic novel, a lot of the scenes are jam packed with information, but blink and you miss it. How could it be the same experience? I feel the same way about other books, like Joseph Hellers Catch-22. The film tried, the series lost all the humor but the book was written perfectly, with perfect pathos and comic timing built into the words. No series or film can capture that.Growing up reading Batman in the sixties, I loved it. The tv series was a disappointment, but I still had to watch it. Later on I learned to enjoy the movie versions, but it wasn't MY Batman. Just learned to think of it as an alternate universe Batman.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Great Cinema, endlessly rewatchable","That movie aged well. I remember that, back in 2009, viewers compared Watchmen to SinCity and concluded, the former couldn't quite measure up. But I keep rewatching it fondly. What connects every single superhero in the band is that they can't care about humanity, especially not when they try. Most powerful Dr Manhattan has several relationships with several women and has to fake enjoying them. I love that the original comic built a consistent alternate universe in which such superheroes make sense. It's set in an alternate 80s, in which US President Nixon succumbs to the watchmen. Great acting, love for details in an alternate universe, lots of cynicism, dark humour - Great Cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"One Man, One Watch","This to my taste is another clumsy deal: centered on an existing product, the attempts at being visually coherent should be more successful than they are. Its a mess, visually and rhythmically.There are two things that impressed me though.I thought the ""Rorschach"" character was very successful, in part because he pushed a strong path through the chaos that was both the world of the movie and the movie. He was fully integrated: story, bearing, visuals, including some of the setups. Its baffling to me how everyone else would be so clearly inferior in execution. This idea of having a ""mask"" (which is basically just a headsock) that forms dynamic blots — it is genius.The other thing, dear reader, is something of a personal quirk. I have a fascination with orreries. These are — originally — models of the solar system that were by gears and tracks, novel machinery of different types, supposed to model the movement of at least the planets. As an student of modeling and abstraction, these have a historical significance for me, and I find that they have become a sort of minor but very strong icon in film.Here we have one, a modern type. It is almost a perfect blend of Superman's crystal fort in the first movie, and the ""device"" in ""Contact."" We are supposed to believe that this is the perfect creation of a perfect mind, one that can see everything in how it works and can model it in such a way that it controls those forces. It is, thus, a model of himself, everything he knows and his transit and container. There is a plot point where the lover's emotions destroy is by simply existing, but that is another story.I loved the design of the thing; its just marvelous. These three dimensional model- environments just thrill me. I wanted to recommend ""Knowing"" just based on the stellated spaceship alone. This is so much more laden with visual mysticism.Try to sit through this mess for the successful character and this orrery.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Who watches the Watchmen,"Watchmen is a dark, violent, and intense dissection of morality that constantly raises the question where do you draw the line between right and wrong. In the majority of a superhero movies, the line between good and evil is clear, however in this, all of the protagonists, and antagonists, are willing to commit terrible acts for what they believe is the greater good.Even if this movie didn't have such an interesting challenge of morality, it still would serve as an exceptional superhero-noir film (In my opinion, superior to The Dark Knight). It has excellent cinematography and CGI, an awesome soundtrack, an interesting non-linear plot, a surprisingly likeable protagonist, and a proper antagonist.Highly Recommend: 9.7/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
An epic spectacle!,"'Watchmen' is a very long movie and a bit slow at times, but it is such a beautifully made film that I enjoyed every moment.The film starts with the murder of Edward Blake aka The Comedian. Edward was a member of the now retired superhero group called 'Watchmen'. One of the members, Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) contacts the rest of the group members warning them someone might be killing off the Watchmen members .Through memories and back flashes we learn who these members were before they became superheroes. Doctor Manhattan (Billy Crudup) is a renowned nuclear physicist who gained extraordinary powers through a terrible accident. He is the only member of the group who became a super being.'Watchmen' takes many turns throughout the film and there's so much development, it is a lot to digest. In contrast to the dramatic elements, the film was also much gorier than expected. 'Watchmen' will definitely not satisfy every palate, but whichever way you look at it, 'Watchmen' is an epic spectacle. It boasts incredible visuals and excellent photography, and even a good soundtrack. And how can I ever forget that swinging blue penis!'Watchmen' is a film that definitely will benefit from repeat viewings.

Amazing adaptation,"Loved this. Amazing how so much effort has been put into making many scenes almost identical to the book.Brilliant use of music.Here we go again with some ramblings to make up the mandatory 600 words, with a slight spoiler; compared to the book I found the story was a bit clearer from the start in the film. I also liked than Veidts monologue was not as long as it is in the book. They managed to do this by revealing bits here and there throughout. Would have liked for the story within a story to have been included. Apparantly it was filmed but they didn't want the film to be that long.

Watchmen: A second opinion,"I used to hate this movie a lot.The first time I watched it, I felt it totally missed the point the original graphic novel. But after a couple of rewatches, I ended liking it more. I guess that ridiculous HBO ""Watchmen"" series (Which missed the point of the graphic novel even more) made me realize that this movie could have been way, way worse. Way more ridiculous, like that series.It's amazing how the same story can change so much depending on the way it is narrated, and while the plot of this movie (in general lines) is very faithful to the source material, plenty scenes and the way many characters are portrayed on screen change the perception I had on them: For example, this movie has a more sympathetic view on Rorschach than Moore ever had (It's not like the comic had no sympathy for him, but his actions as a vigilante are portrayed in a more heroic manner here) but despite that, the result is acceptable, and the casting is spot-on.I am somewhat ambivalent about the visual aspect (Compare the muted colors with the vibrant colorization from Dave Gibbons) but I guess the result isn't terrible either. And the portrayal of Dr. Manhattan is frankly accurate to the comics (Unlike the ridiculous smurf moved by strings from the HBO series).Some fans might not like it, but I guess is time to accept this might be the best Watchmen adaptation we will ever get.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Stellar Comic Book Adaptation, the best ever","If you want to watch a movie that is extremely close loyal to the source material, visually, all the characters look like the comic-book version of said characters, to a degree that is striking, I mean top-shelf casting, acting, directing, photography, ambiance, incredible story-telling, beautiful editing and CGI, its simply amazing and I can't get enough of it, I just wish we had a Rorcharsh sequel or a show telling his story better, its such a compelling character with a complex story, I know he is supposed to be kind of an anti-hero vigilante, the real-world Batman if you will, but in hard times like these that we're living, characters like this can be inspiring for people who seek justice and they can't find any, not to become a vigilante, but to find the courage to do good in the world even when the odds are stacked against you, he's a hobo, he has nothing but strength, courage, discipline and intelligence, and that is enough for him to make a difference.

Loved it!,"Watchmen is directed by Zack Snyder and adapted to screenplay by David Hayter and Alex Tse from the Alan Moore/David Gibbons graphic novel. It stars Patrick Wilson, Malin Ackerman, Billy Crudup, Jackie Earle Haley, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Carla Gugino and Matt Frewer. Music is by Tyler Bates and cinematography by Larry Fong.In 1985, in an alternate world where Richard Nixon has been successively reelected with no Watergate, the nuclear war seems to be eminent due to the increasing tension between the United States of America and the Soviet Union. Eight years ago, the Keene Law signed by Nixon forced the early retirement of the second generation of masked vigilante superheroes known as Watchmen, but the interference of the powerful physicist Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) leading the victory of USA in Vietnam holds the ultimate nuclear attack of Soviet Union. When the former Watchmen The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is brutally murdered, his colleague Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) decides to investigate and discovers a Machiavellian conspiracy to bring worldwide peace.The action sequences are good, spectacular, and rely a lot on violence and fighting techniques. Gore is glorious when has on screen opportunities.Watchmen is an emotionally complex story that does not pull any of the punches. The acting is excellent, the characters are believable and, visually, it is amazing. Having never read the graphic novel, I walked into this film semi-blind. I was worried that I would be completely lost, and there were parts that I had to re-watch, but I was very impressed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

The realistic consequences of living such a lifestyle is shown and takes out the romance of being an icon for such bold attempts at being the protectors of reason, justice and peace.

"The ""Citizen Kane"" of Super Hero movies","I don't read graphic novels or the like, so my only history with seeing comic book characters are those on the big screen. Superman, Spiderman, Batman, X Men, and so on. Of all the these that I have seen, Watchmen is the ""Citizen Kane"" of super hero movies. Honestly, this movie broke barriers the same way Orson Welles did. Seeing super heroes naked, committing crimes, doing the dirty work for the government, rape, and showing very graphic scenes of gore. On the flipside, this very dense movie lacks the momentum expected in these kind of crackerjack movies. But once again, this is not that kind of movie, and deserves to be in a different category than big budget tent pole films. It deserves accolades for being probably the most expensive niche film ever made. Not everybody will get excited over the story of a retired, very mediocre looking guy reacquainting himself with crime fighting. There are long epic passages of storytelling, which I'm sure are gratifying to the fans of the original story. This film is supposed to cause you to think about the complexities about having super abilities and the difficulty of staying true to your morals. If one is prepared to watch this kind of film, especially after more than one viewing, one can truly appreciate what has been achieved here. The downside is, being the first of it's kind, there are probably now going to be other filmmakers who will draw inspiration from this genre busting movie and refine it in films yet to be. Meaning that the new formula will be tinkered with, and no doubt ending up being more popular than this one. The same thing happened with ""Citizen Kane"". Welle's film did not get a warm response upon it's initial release. It was only years later when it got the attention it deserved.This film, the next film by the director of ""300"", shows a competent hand with a distinct vision. I feel we the audience are not as advanced as he is in presenting us with a new look and feel. There is a state of mind in the film industry that films like ""Watchmen"" are not what people want to see. It will take a movie producer with foresight to see that it is ultimately an appropriate new avenue to explore if one wants to present audiences with something new in the now overcrowded comic book movie genre. ""Watchmen"" certainly fulfills the eye candy quotient, but it's different pace and sentimentality probably will test the patience of younger audiences. So yes, you might as well make the film for adult audiences and make it R-rated. The amount of positive elements that push the envelope will cause subsequent films to have no choice but acknowledge these new aspects to the super hero genre, and we are all the better for it.""Watchmen"" follows a group of people who are troubled human beings first, and super heroes second. The comedian character represents all that is ugly about America, from JFK to Viet Nam. The scientist character similarly represents the abuse of America's military might. No one is truly innocent, and ""Watchmen"" first threads then unravels these problematic positions they take when dealing with the real world. I am giving this film a 7 out of 10, but I might find it worth a better rating over time. Right now, the only reason I don't give it a better rating is my own aversion to the dated period details: Nixon, Eighties music, excessive night-time Noir production design, and mostly the lack of momentum that made ""300"" so exciting to watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Great graphic adaptation, poor narrative.","Graphically Snyder's watchmen is brilliant, from faithful costumes (not only the supes) to atrezzo and even camera work to reflect the panels found in the original comic (yes, comic, not graphic novel).The use of the photography is almost perfect, the imitation of the composition and light is just a carbon copy of the original comic.However, it seems to be missing a lot of the small details that help the characters truly tell you what they feel or think. It's like any other Snyder film, it makes a coffee but it has the ability to only show you the froth and not the content.His characters are faded and weak impersonations of what you will find in the pages of the comic-book.

Total Disappointment!!!,"The acting is, in a lot of roles, irritating. Some of the roles though are played well like Rorschach and The Comedian. The voice of Dr.Manhattan is just irritating, also the appearance and the behavior of Ozymandias is also very very poor.The special effects are annoying at best. Constant slow motion, crappy flashbacks and irritating sounds.The story is changed in small, but irritating ways. I mean the violence is blown out of proportion, but the body of the comic, the whole point of it all just disappeared. It just became a big budget, commercial, Hollywood action movie.After watching this i really doubt the intellect of Snyder, the comic is a brilliant piece of work, and it's really hard to ruin it, but he did it, well actually that is an amazing feat.All in all the film is a huge disappointment and just gives the comic a bad name. If it were up to me I'd give a different synopsis something like blood, slow motion, and 3 hours of total boredom and irritation.

"A good movie in its own right, but that doesn't cut it!","I know a 6 seems harsh. The movie is good. Well done with good acting. If there was no source material I would have thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a feat not easily accomplished and it should be praised as a movie. However, I simply refuse to give this a higher rating. The fact that this was even made into a movie is appalling to me. Hollywood needs to get over comics and give them back to the people faithful to the medium.Watchmen was the first comic i ever read and it opened up so much to me. It is so much more than what people see comics as. This isn't Batman, Iron Man, X-Men, Wolverine, Spider-Man, or any of the other properties being whored out to moviegoers. Watchmen is literature and is layered with great characters, compelling story, great writing, infinite references, and themes that run far beyond what comics had ever been. Trying to make this into a movie is like trying to put everything from LOTR into a movie. It's too dense and the subtlties of the graphic novel simply cannot be put on screen effectively.My other argument is one that people seem to overlook or dismiss, which really saddens me. Alan Moore never wanted movies made from his work. So far four have been made without his blessing. Why? Because DC owns his work. He literally has no choice but to separate himself from his own work. It's like working in a Taiwanese sweatshop. He was just labor.That said, the movie is seriously flawed in relationship to the novel. So much is missing, it seems like the SparkNotes version of Watchmen. No Black Freighter, no Under the Hood. The density from the comics just isn't there because it couldn't possibly be. Dr. Manhattan looks great, but he is played wrong. Things about all the characters changed in the movie because real people played them. It was doomed to fail. Moore's writing and construction of each character is essential to the story and to all interaction throughout. The ending is changed, and it is terrible. Total Hollywood ending. Veidt still does it his way, but the effect is marred and the characters react differently. Zack Snyder wanted an edgy take on superheroes, but it flops for him. Also, none of the characters besides Manhattan have superpowers, but in the movie they seem pretty super. The whole movie feels like a soulless copy of the original. The choice of music is ridiculous, too. The only good choice was Dylan's at the beginning credits. Overall, it comes no where near what the comics are, a great piece of literature.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Mesmerising and monotonous in equal measure,"Based on the graphic novel of the same name, by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, 'Watchmen' is set in an alternative 1985 and follows a bunch of ex-masked heroes, as they... try to save... the world? Themselves? You see, it really isn't as straight forward as you might think, so if you're looking for a fast and fun popcorn movie, look elsewhere. Watchmen isn't your average super-hero movie. Hell, it isn't even a super-hero movie, full-stop!Possibly a strange comparison this, but 'Watchmen' reminds me of 'The Golden Compass', a film which I had awaited the release of for years. If you're not aware, it's based on Philip Pullman's first novel in the 'His Dark Materials' series of books, which is a work of literary genius. The books are dark, mysterious and subtle, and the film is... colourful, mainstream and over-the-top. After watching the film, I was overcome with disappointment, and yet, I still enjoyed it, because despite the many flaws with the film, you could still make out a cracking, wonderfully original story underneath it all.I'd never read the 'Watchmen' graphic novel, and yet I was left with a similar after-taste after watching this film adaptation. I was bored and mesmerised in equal measure; this is a film which is both insanely pretentious and self-indulgent, and yet rich with the extraordinary imagination and originality of the novel. All of the good parts of this film are a direct result of the novel on which it is based (and which, on a positive note, this film has caused me to start reading), and all of the apparent flaws, are down to the director's taste.So... the director: Zack Synder... you may be familiar with his work on '300', which I found to be quite ridiculous; a fantastic example of style over a substance; and yet some may argue it changed the face of movie-making. Once the opening 20 minutes of '300' had passed, and the feeling of awe and wonder at the visceral and exhilarating action had subsided, I quickly became bored and confused. Does everything really need to be in ultra slow-motion? Even the bits where it's just a bunch of guys walking? (Mind you, I suppose it did bump it up to the length of a normal feature film).Sadly, his patented style is still abundant and present in 'Watchmen'. And whilst it is perhaps more justifiable to use this method of film-making in a story as complex and epic as this, it actually detracts from the gritty and stark realism the novel was always meant to imply. 'The Golden Compass' made the same mistake. It's ironic that in trying to make a story more cinematic, and whilst being almost completely faithful to the chronology of the story itself, Snyder has removed the very essence of what makes 'Watchmen' so very poignant. The question, ""what if super-heroes really existed?"" simply never occurred to me whilst watching this, because I was so utterly removed from the alternate-reality Snyder has created. Sticking to Alan Moore's less stylistic vision of America, and more humanistic exploration of the characters, would have engaged the audience far more, and thus forced them to ask the questions the novel clearly evoked.The soundtrack, despite the presence of some great tunes, is often bemusing. Philip Glass's 'Pruit Igoe' is beautiful and gets me every time I hear it; Simon & Garfunkel's ""The Sound of Silence"", however, is far too obvious to accompany a funeral scene. Moreover, using Bob Dylan's ""Times They Are a Changin'"", whilst again a little ""on-the-nose"" to accompany the opening montage where the audience literally see the 'times-a-changing', is nevertheless an inspired choice; using Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"" during an excessively prolonged sex scene really isn't. Speaking of which, both the seemingly endless nature of the sex scene itself, and the choice of music to accompany it, further exemplifies Snyder's unrelenting need to overstate everything.Don't get me wrong, there are some things Snyder gets right. For one, he doesn't pander to the Hollywood formula, and the 'Watchmen' we get to see on screen is just as unconventional and controversial as the version you can read on the page. Nothing in the Watchmen world, from the characters to the story-arcs is straight-forward; nobody is wholly good nor wholly bad; nothing is black or white; everything, like life, is pretty grey. At times the convoluted plot may leave you feeling a little disorientated, and perhaps this is why Hollywood usually rigidly sticks to the tried and tested formula we're so used to seeing, but Snyder and Warner Brothers should be applauded for having the bravery and tenacity to deliver a movie unlike any other.Ultimately, it is the originality and complexity which will divide audiences and is what left me with mixed feelings. Technically, everything is close to flawless; the actors portray the wonderfully diverse characters with aplomb, the special effects and production design are simply fantastic, and I found the plot to be both engaging and thought-provoking. But the whole experience falls short of delivering any kind of lasting emotion and it is this lack of connection with most of the characters, that creates a somewhat puerile atmosphere.Like, 'The Golden Compass', though, I believe that the strength of the source material shines through in the end and, despite its many flaws, 'Watchmen' is too unique and rich with detail to be ignored. Be warned, it's at times violent, subversive and perverse but this is a more courageous attempt at mainstream film-making than pretty much any other, and for that, is completely deserving of your attention.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Didn't read the comic, wish Id never saw the movie...","The trailer made this movie look great! The actual movie was an absolute disgrace. It was too long, badly edited, acting and script like a bad soap and one weird, weird soundtrack...I will explain!The plot and storyline jumped everywhere, it just didn't flow well at all. The story was poorly explained and I believe the director tried to fit too much comic into a film and ended up diluting the quality. It was as if bits of the comic book were thrown in for comic geeks sake only, not for the sake of a movie in its own right. The costumes, I know they are based on the comic, are ridiculous, actually comical rather than comic book. The Thunderbirds look cooler and more dangerous than these muppets. The characters are fat and out of shape, with exception of female lead, completely unbelievable, especially when they end up taking on a whole prison with extreme martial arts...The action was rare and poor also.The soundtrack had some classic tunes but were so inappropriate, it was so random. The film is meant to be based in 1985, it has one scene in the Antartic whilst playing Jimmy Hendrix - All along the watch towers? A song from the 1960's that is synonymous with Vietnam ? It also had a nude sex scene, which are always good, but so inappropriate in this movie and played the Jeff Buckley version, I think, of Hallelujah... that got a good laugh out of the cinema.One of the random scenes where two of the supposed heroes went on a vigilante spree, and ended up saving people from a fire, was hilarious. The female superhero jumped through a roof with fire and wood dropping everywhere, her hair was for a second everywhere, it instantly shot to her hair being salon perfect...so B movie! There is too much for me to slag off in this movie, people are obviously disillusioned by their nostalgia for the comic books, either that or the nudity...The only positive things I could recall was the performance of the character 'Rorschach'. The only character that you actually felt anything for and he had one or two good scenes also. The special affects were not bad either but were wasted in this movie.A few people walked out, I wanted to go but really thought it may redeem itself. It didn't redeem anything, it was terrible.

Watchmen: When Superheroes Play Philosophers,"Right from the start, you want to tell Rorschach to stop looking at the world like it's an old, worn-out slipper. This guy doesn't care about Superman-style ideals or saving the day with smiles. No, Rorschach's philosophy is more like a frying pan-everything is dark, gritty, and always on the verge of burning. You could almost call him ""Batman in crisis mode,"" because his worldview is about as cheerful as a funeral in the rain.This isn't the Avengers swooping in to save the day with Tony Stark-level quips. No, here, everyone's got serious issues. Take Nite Owl, for instance; he seems like a guy who spends his nights wondering why Tinder doesn't work for him. And the Comedian? Well, he makes Deadpool look like a choirboy. If you like your heroes messed up, Watchmen delivers in spades.Dr. Manhattan? He's the dude with all the power in the universe but spends most of his time saying, ""Yeah, but I don't feel like it."" He could vaporize any villain in a nanosecond, but instead, he prefers to stand there, naked, philosophizing while staring at Earth from the moon. It's like if Goku decided to spend his days knitting instead of throwing Kamehamehas.Ozymandias? He's the guy who tells you he had everything figured out from the start-like, he probably knew what you were going to have for lunch today. The guy thinks he's smarter than everyone, and honestly, you want to hate him for it. But you have to admit, his master plan is so twisted, it makes Voldemort look like a harmless Boy Scout.Let's be real, though: Watchmen is visually stunning, slick, and full of style. Snyder dishes out slow-motion shots like he's handing out candy on Halloween. And that opening scene to Bob Dylan's The Times They Are A-Changin'? It's a masterpiece. You just want to stand up and say, ""Thanks, Zack."" Even though sometimes you feel like he's gone a bit overboard with the slow-mo, you can't help but love him for it.If you're looking for a Marvel-style, explosion-heavy flick with little thought required, keep moving.

"Despite a major issue, I enjoy it spectacularly","I feel that plot structuring isn't one of the movie's strengths. Nothing is emphasized through appropriate cinematic language. Such as giving more running time to what is relevant to the plot, and less to what is just an enjoyable subplot. Or using a musical score to give the scenes a certain place in the movie, rather than letting every individual scene have maximum impact. It is just scene after scene after scene, without giving a sense of where it is heading at or what it wants to say.Obviously the filmmakers wanted to keep as much from the original source as possible, while also staying as true to every little drawn image as possible. Here I have to agree with the popular criticism, this is just not how turning a comic book into an epic movie works. Now this didn't ruin my enjoyment of the movie, but here it clearly failed in a department in which I think no good genre picture should normally fail.So for me this problem hinders the film from living up to its potential regarding the building of suspense. But why it still works for me is because I find each individual scene on its own to be tense. The sociological, scientific and philosophical ideas of the story speak so well to me that it holds my attention for the full running time and never makes me lose interest in what happens or what is going to happen.At least the plot is adequately coherent and the characters consistent, so Zack Snyder hardly is a failure as a director, like some people suggest. Not to mention the visual effects, which apparently effortlessly were integrated into the story, and serve telling the story as well as making the film's visual style even possible. This to manage and make work, also takes considerable skill on the director's part.It's an unusual story of epic proportions, with as epic visuals. I consider it to be a science fiction film, playing in an alternate universe and having a character like Dr. Manhattan. All the parts with Dr. Manhattan are also easily my favorite ones, because without him the story wouldn't be one of nearly such grand scale and his physical nature offers some welcome brain food concerning quantum mechanics, which is a highly unexplored subject in Sci-Fi cinema, by the way. Those are the main reasons why watching it was a great experience for me, in spite of my gripes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A Simply Amazing Cinematic Achievement,"I'm not one to gush, especially over action films, and particularly comic book adaptations. And I should say here before I go on that I was hugely disappointed by Christopher Nolan's THE DARK KNIGHT. But WATCHMEN so far surpassed my expectations that I had to write in and vote for my favorite movie of the decade (it just surpassed MEMENTO).Casting and performances were almost dead on. Kudos especially to Jeffrey Dean Morgan's star-making turn as the Comedian and Jackie Earle Haley's amazing transformation, both behind his digital mask and without it, into Rorschach. I agree with some other posts and reviews expressing disappointment regarding Matthew Goode as Ozymandias, but he grew on me and by the film's end I had learned to respect, fear and despise Goode's Veidt.Visually, the film simply brought WATCHMEN's visual style to the screen as if Dave Gibbons' artwork was a working storyboard. I can't imagine a more rigorously faithful replication.One quibble: some of the on-screen violence was so amped up from the graphic novel that it shocked me, particularly a fight scene in an alley where Dan Dreiberg and Laurie Jupiter literally slaughter a gang of thieves. I expected that kind of viscousness from Rorschach, not from Night Owl and the Silk Spectre.I could go on and on, but for now I'll just congratulate Zack Snyder and put him at the top of my list to adapt that other majestic opus so often put in the same sentence as WATCHMEN. I'm referring of course to THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS. That's a long shot given the commercial success of Nolan's THE DARK KNIGHT, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Most violent, gory and sexy comic book movie ever.","I consider myself to be nearly immune to movie gore and violence, having been an ambulance EMT and emergency nurse. That said, many of the images in this film were almost uncomfortably shocking.The sex was amazing! Malin Akerman is beautiful to begin with, but was presented as about the most alluring character I have ever seen in a film. The sex scenes were very graphic, and showed the best and least-known benefit to being, and having sex with, a superhero.The story line was incredibly complicated, but presented in a way that made it easy to follow without losing sight of the characters. The characters were deeply flawed, and their problems seemed so much more real than those of the X-Men or Batman, for example.I'd recommend the film to anyone with a strong stomach who wants to leave the theater completely turned on.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
********DoN't-WaTcH Men**********,"I'm starting to lose faith in a lot of the ratings presented in IMDb, especially with movies like this scoring 80%+.......seriously people???We have a simple case here of users logging on and giving this such a high rating either because: a) the economic crisis is just driving everyone nuts, or b) the 60,000 odd cast and crew were also paid to post up positive feedback in the hope of drawing poor, unsuspecting movie-goers into actually giving this a shot! I'm more inclined to believe that its the latter, and if thats the case the sad reality is that it has actually worked.I still I haven't met anyone who has watched this film and not comment on how truly abysmal it was - and everyone they know shared the same sentiments. The constantly flashing big blue penis was already quite disturbing/distracting in itself, but not as much as the script itself. I'll admit that I haven't read the comics, and after viewing the film I have no intention whatsoever of doing so. I think its silly for people to assume that if you didn't enjoy it, its because you didn't understand it or you ""haven't read the comic"" - I've seen and enjoyed many films without having read the books/comics that they originated from.Everything in this film was just lacking on so many levels. The rescue scene followed by the sex scene just about sums up the whole film - it was just non-arousing, boring and pointless. What is it with bad movies and unnecessary sex scenes anyway? The B-grade movie Gabriel had a similar one - and that was the worst movie I had ever seen until I saw Watchmen!

People need to know what to expect going into it,"Okay, I am not going to provide a lengthy synopsis for this movie as it has been done 1000 times before and one more would likely bore readers to tears. I have a few quick points to make and then will be on my way, however, before I make them, I would like to say that I feel this is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time (on my top ten, for sure). Okay, so here it is. I looked at a few comments people have made about this movie and those most common complaints I've seen are:""It's a boring movie that has superheroes without superpowers. It does doesn't have enough action for a superhero movie.""Okay, to better understand Watchmen is to understand that it is an extremely unconventional superhero movie, one that breaks the typical superhero stereotype. It is about normal people (spare Dr. Manhattan) who take it upon themselves to do what they can to protect society. It is not about characters who gain superhuman abilities through a run-in with some form of radiation (again, ignoring Dr. Manhattan); they are not meant to have super powers. And as far as a lack of action is concerned, while I disagree with that statement, it is important to note that the graphic novel and even the movie are described as a ""complex, multi-layered mystery."" If that doesn't give you a heads-up as to what it's going to be like, then I don't know what will. What else did you expect from a movie that labels itself in such a way?""The costumes are hokey, lame, etc.""That's because they are supposed to be. Again, these are normal people who decided to do what they can with what they've got. The costumes are realistic in the sense that normal people can't afford a billion dollar high-tech Batman suit complete with state-of-the-art flying apparatus and seemingly invincible armor. If people were to actually dress up and fight crime like superheroes, their costumes would look a heck of a lot more like the Watchmen's than Batman's or Spiderman's.When you go to see Watchmen don't expect a Batman, Spiderman, Iron Man and so on because that's not what you're going to get. You're going to get just what it says you will, which is a ""complex, multi-layered mystery."" And if you know and expect that going into it, something tells me you're going to love it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Full of sound and fury, but signifying nothing. So is Watchmen: a historic landmark in narcissist film-making","Watchmen opening sequence is something truly memorable: a series of dioramas animated by actors in flesh and bone which, to the sound of The Times They Are A-Changin', by Bob Dylan, narrates the ascension and decline of a group of individuals that, in the 40's, for fun and also due to conviction, invented personas and costumes to team up to fight crime - and then, in the passing of years and transformations that occurred in the United States, began to be identified as a fascist pseudo police, and finally, ended becoming illegal by the government of Richard Nixon (which, in this parallel universe, never resigned and has been elected to presidency for the fifth time). The images are both at the same time beautiful and melancholic, which, underlined by Dylan's song, evoke one of the most vertiginous aspects of American life: the euphoria of the peak and the humiliation of the fall into disgrace. These, however, are the few emotions that Watchmen is capable of provoking in its almost 3 hours lenght. And, every time some sense begins to emerge, the coincidence repeats itself: some iconic and meaning loaded music is monitoring the scene. Which, in other words, means to say that Watchmen doesn't have much inside of it. Directed by Zack Snyder, of 300, he is the cinematographic equivalent of a narcissist: a creature so involved with itself and so full of its own beauty that it doesn't occur to it that it isn't enough only to exist, but that it is also necessary to try to reach the people that are convened to appreciate it.Released in the 80's by Dave Gibons and Alan Moore (which, as in V for Vendetta, demanded by a matter of principle for his name to not appear at the movie credits), the Watchmen graphic novel is considered the gold standard of the genre, the comics that all other comics aspire to be. As always in Moore's work, it carries a political subtext that is at the same time naive and fierce in its disposal to report the infinite variants of the intoxication that power provides. But Watchmen has something more: a delicate and even compassionate understanding of the uneasiness of the soul that having or losing this power leads to. His characters illustrate it in several ways - from the sexual impotence of the Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson), and the obsession for vengeance of Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) to the increasing distance of the superpowerfull Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) puts between himself and humanity and to the venality of the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), whose assassination starts the plot.Zack Snyder follows really close both the situations described by Moore and the sadness of the protagonists. What he can't do is express it: in his own effort in translating the images that could only happen in cinema and in no other visual means. Snyder surrounds the emotion center of the story with so much noise and fury that he overshadows it completely. So, strong actors like Patrick Wilson and Billy Crudup become small and out of scale in this gigantic tableau; and, when violence breaks out, it doesn't transmit the ferocity - it looks like it is only there for free and it is almost pornographic, as some sort of knock on the head that serves to draw the audience out of the induced apathy by the excess of plot and lack of what to communicate with it. Therefore, Watchmen seems like destined to become a landmark: a landmark in both its gorgeous visual concept and language, and as of the sterility in which a certain strand of American cinema is going through. As Dr. Manhattan, this is a movie immensely powerful and impressive - and can barely remember what is like to be a human being.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Interesting but just not my cup of tea,"I went out and bought Watchmen the complete 12 episode comic so I guess I actually saw this movie before I saw this movie. It was interesting but just not my cup of tea. I knew I'd have difficulty with it having no named Hollywood stars to draw me into the characters. The acting was okay but how good an actor do you have to be to say most of the dialog. I have to agree with those who say sometimes sticking strictly to the comic is a mistake. Cronenberg took a graphic novel ie History of Violence and gave a cohesive story with a character, Tom Stahl, that we could root for. This is a disconnected group of people none of whom have any redeeming values and we're suppose to think that's great because they're 'real human beings'. Well being a hero isn't about being a human being, its about being more than you think you could be, and I don't mean more self serving.The visuals were okay but the fight scenes were overly stylized, violent and make these so called non superheroes look like they had real powers. Probably will do big business this weekend but will fade away like so many of these flicks do ie Sin City, 300 etc. By the way there was a mass exodus from the theater where I saw the movie as soon as the credits started to roll.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A masterpiece!!!,"I love the comic more than any comic or book I have ever read. For the last 30 years a small number of producers have wanted to make this film, but everyone else said ""it was impossible and unfilmable."" But its finally been done by none other then Zach Snyder, the genius behind 300.So let me start by saying, it is the most stunningly beautiful film you will ever see. The cinematography alone is beyond anything previously made. As for the movie, it pays perfect homage to the graphic novel, taking the material and changing it just enough to work with film. Looking at the source however, I'm truly surprised it came out so good and am certain it will offend quite a number of people for its gore and content.I watched it in Imax on the night of it's release, 12:00 in the morning and walked out of the cinema 3 hours later breathing the night's air and wishing it wasn't over. This is not a movie for idiots, superhero fan's, or people looking for a simple plot. This is a movie for someone looking for a rich and deep portrayal of humans, with an added dose of violence to appease your dark side. And for what it is no one could have done better. Also I agree with Zach, I hope Alan Moore will one day watch it, he'll realize it does justice to his comic....So in closing I urge you to watch the Watchmen, you will not be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Highly underrated; a few minor flaws, but magnificent and stunning to watch. 10/10","7.7 seemed an average rating, but 'Watchmen' does deserve higher. Apart from a few sloppy moments, the film seemed amazing. I can't believe Metascore only gave it %55! You cannot miss this if you are a fan of the graphic novel. I read it after I saw the film, and I can't decide which was better. Of course, the book had more detail and explained the story a bit more, but the cinematography and choreography of the film was dazzling.I'm against CGI, but, in this case I can make a huge exception. The fight scenes are the best you'll see in ANY film. The opening is stunning, and the entire visual quality of the film is unforgettably brilliant. Of course, this applies to all of Zack Snyder's films, but especially to this one.I'm also very impressed on how the film had no stars. Instead, chosen to act were actors who were identical to the characters from the comic. Everything was just as you imagined in the book. I'm especially impressed with Rorschach, who was just the same as in the book: perfect. His costume, the growly voice, everything was brilliant.The Comedian was another perfectly adapted character. He seemed like the ultimate anti-hero, really getting a lot of hatred across to him, but still... he was so cool.The script is just as perfect as in the graphic novel. All of the philosophical, meaningful, dreamy lines... it's a wonder this film didn't get so much praise as it should have.The plot didn't get across as well as it did, which I think is one of the only minor flaws, along with the ending. Otherwise, this film is a must-see for any cinema fans.10/10. See this film, no matter what Metascore tells you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Great cinema!,"This is a wonderful piece of cinema. As a comic-book turned into film, I found it even more satisfying than ""300 (2006)"". Zack Snyder has the rare ability to humble himself before the original artist. He works like a converter, giving life to the comic book pages without adding any interpretation or look-at-me moments of his own. Every frame looks exactly like it does in the books. More importantly, he did not get tempted to ""modernise"" the story. Retaining the Nixon, Vietnam and other references kept the story real for both fans of ""Watchmen"" and people who have only heard of this classic.The only group that seems to have trashed the movie are journalists (no surprises there!) and people with no prior context of the book-- neither as art, nor as a statement. They tended to equate this with the usual Spiderman and Power Rangers variety of comic-book films, concluding that this movie came out wanting. I came here today when I read a reference in a Wolverine review, comparing its poor reception to the dud that was Watchmen. Gee, how they missed the point!! Wolverine was just lazy film-making, a badly made film with no story/plot/point. Merely squeezing what they could from the stale franchise. Watchmen, on the other hand, is a well-made movie with painstaking attention to detail and incredibly faithful to the source. Comparing the two only justifies the closing of newspapers across the US-- traditional journalists do not seem to go beyond the official Kool-Aid. Whether it is movie reviews or supporting the Iraq war, they merely parrot what appears to them as the ""acceptable"" view.Watchmen is a great movie and a must-watch. By anyone over 16 :-)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Crudup and Wilson,"Billy Crudup and Patrick Wilson are two of the young actors I follow and wait for with a certain amount of longing. So imagine my shock. I always refer to them as ""pure actors"" the kind of actor that will never go for the buck. I, naturally, forgot the power of the buck but in this case is terribly depressing. I'm sure the ""Watchmen"" have a following but so did Charles Manson. I love movies and very rarely use the word ""hate"" referring to a movie but this time I was tempted. I even stayed for its interminable and unendurable length. I must grant you that it may just be me. A generational thing but that doesn't prevent my depression. I had to run and watch ""Angeles In America"", ""Little Children"", ""Jesus's Son"" and ""Stage Beauty"" to fall in love with Crudup and Wilson all over again and eliminate the sense of disgust that ""Watchmen"" provoked in me.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A superhero film with substance beneath the surface,"Typically if you go and watch a Marvel film you'll get bright colours, a superficial plot, and a predictable ending. Watchmen does not conform to these stereotypes, which is exactly what makes this film stand out in a cluttered market. As with the Dark Knight trilogy, having a storyline that actually challenges the audience makes for far improved viewing. Watchmen's story of an alternate world where superheroes are now defunct changes the dynamic from the start, along with the imminent threat of nuclear war. The vulnerability of these (mostly) human superheroes adds an element of suspense not often found with Marvel/DC films.The acting in Watchmen is good, but really the devotion to the source material is what elevates the entire film. The comics were so well written (as indicated by their success) that no deviation is required, beautifully set amongst the grime of 1980s Manhattan. Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) plays narrator for the majority of the film, a pessimistic ex-hero longing for a return to the glory days; his pursuit of the truth is relentless, but personally Dr Manhattan (Billy Crudup) is the undoubted draw. Crudup doesn't have to display much range, but his brutal honestly provides an amazing contrast to the selfishness of human empathy throughout the movie. Visually and musically, Watchmen is also elite - the score samples the best of 80s music, whilst the palette of vivid yellows and blues cuts through the darkness emulating the film's tone.It's sad that Zack Snyder failed to replicate Watchmen in any of the films he's directed since (Man of Steel, Batman vs. Superman etc.) - if he could find this formula again, DC would be in far safer hands. Watchmen cuts itself a niche in a crowded superhero genre, and superheroes are all the better for it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Beautiful.  Art-House Comic Book Gets Beautiful Cinematic Treatment.,"I was hesitant. The comic book is GENIUS. The movie will not be because the director and writers will either rewrite the thing to get it onto the screen, or be SO faithful as to render it moot, on screen. The sheer genius of the comic book makes it difficult, certainly, but to remain too faithful to the written word is typically the death knell to any visual work...except when the written word is a graphic novel (and/or comic book), it would seem.The film is genius, but (as others have pointed out) it's the genius of the comic book this movie holds and NOT directorial genius. As closely as this follows the graphic serial, it must have been pretty easy to alter the direction of the narrative, watch the ques, and insert visuals as dictated by the source materials, which were kept there on the set and used like a Watchman ""Bible,"" according to news sources.The angles, the colors, lighting, all contribute as much to the overall work as the performances and film quality, but this is exactly what the comics set as axiom wherein these elements are concerned. There are no surprises as to the cinematic adaptation. The surprise would have been a creative attempt at an actual adaptation. This is (not merely, mind you) the graphic novels translated to film, rather than an actual adaptation.That all having been said, this is fantastic both fundamentally and in final execution! It is visceral, graphic, soulful, and visually stunning. But more importantly, it is beautiful, intellectual, and above all, human. Oh yes, it's the overall humanity of the work that renders it a must see, must experience, must HAVE film of the year.This is amazing, and my expectations were already running pretty high. That's saying something.On a parental note, however, this film features full male frontal nudity. It is done artistically and is a necessary and beautiful element of the film, but I thought there will be MANY parents out there who will not be expecting it.It rates a solid 8.9/10 from...the Fiend :.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Great Adaptation,"Imagine a story where super heroes are not always the good guys, and where they could be just as vicious and cruel as many of the villains they fight. This story would be very similar to the film Watchmen. Watchmen is a film that deviates from the average super hero story by making its heroes more human and much darker than the average super heroes. Actually, Watchmen seemed to be more of a murder mystery than a super hero movie to me. The murder mystery aspect of the movie makes it extremely interesting to watch and view.Watchmen starts off when a ""hero"" by the name of the Comedian is killed. After the murder a masked hero by the name of Rorschach, who wears a mask of constantly shifting ink blots, begins to investigate and comes up with a theory that someone is killing off masked heroes. To not spoil the movie, the rest of the movie consists of Rorschach and the other heroes trying to find out who is trying to kill off the heroes and what is actually going on.Since Watchmen is essentially a murder mystery with super heroes thrown in, it is somewhat hard to compare it fully to other movies. Watchmen is definitely unique and is in a league of its own, and does a great job at keeping the viewer interested. The story is full of surprises, twists, and suspense.The Watchmen film does a great job at staying true to the graphic novel that it is based off of. While most film adaptations of novels take many liberties with the stories and characters, Watchmen takes care to stay true, for the most part, to the graphic novel. The only real liberties taken, aside from a plot twist at the end, were to make one or two of the characters' costumes more frightening. This can be seen when comparing the costume worn by the Night Owl between the graphic novel and the movie. Surprisingly, the film still holds many of the dark themes that the graphic novel does. Both stories explore the darker side of humanity and its effects on the heroes. This can easily be seen with what happens to Rorschach, and what events make him become a violent and brutal vigilante. The event is hard to watch and very sad, but the film does a excellent job at portraying it.The heroes in the movie are not really all that ""super,"" as in only one, Doctor Manhattan, actually has super powers. The rest of the heroes are just regular people who are adept at fighting and dress up in costumes. Doctor Manhattan is the exception to this because he was granted super powers because of a freak science accident. Also, as stated previously, the heroes are not portrayed as having to be ""good guys."" For example, in one scene the Comedian is in a bar along with Doctor Manhattan in Vietnam, after the Vietnam War is over, when a pregnant Vietnamese girl walks in and tells him that she has his baby. He states, ""I'm leaving. I'm going to forget about you and your horrible sweaty little piece of sh*t country."" He then proceeds to tell the girl to leave, but she just stays. Then the pregnant girl breaks a bottle and slashes the Comedian across the face in anger. The Comedian immediately pulls out his gun and shoots her until she is dead. Doctor Manhattan, standing right next to him, asks her why he shot the girl who is pregnant with his baby. The Comedian answers, ""You watched me. You could have turned the gun into steam, the bullets into mercuryYou really don't give a damn about human beings."" This scene shows that the heroes in Watchmen are much darker than what one would normally imagine as a super hero. This gives the movie a much different and darker feel from other movies such as Spiderman and Batman Begins.Even though the movie is excellent and everything is done and portrayed very well, there are two main complaints that I have. The first is what happens in the ending of the film. Even though the small details of the ending of the graphic novel and movie are very similar, how the events unfold is much different in the two. This difference will only be noticed by fans of the graphic novel, and those who have not read it will not enjoy the film any less. The change seems to have been made because it would be hard to portray what happens in the graphic novel in a film. However, the second and biggest complaint I have lies with Doctor Manhattan. Even though they did a wonderful job on his character in the film version, they seemed to show too much of him. The problem is that Doctor Manhattan is naked throughout most of the story, being that he is almost god-like and does not really have a need for clothes. This results in the movie showing more of him constantly than many would like.Overall I would say that Watchmen is an excellent movie, and is definitely a must-watch for those who want a new and unique movie. It is also great for fans of the graphic novel due to its faithful adaptation. Aside from the change in the ending and showing off Doctor Manhattan's private area, the movie is excellent. I would recommend this movie for anyone who is a fan of suspenseful movies, super hero movies, or just viewers who want to experience an extremely unique and exciting film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A surprisingly great Movie,"First of all I have to admit that I didn't read the graphic novel before I watched the movie, so my opinion maybe will not congruent with the opinion of die-hard comic readers and longterm Watchmen fans.The movie stunned me. It really looks great, has the feeling of a comic and the soundtrack is amazingly incorporated into the movie. The film is pretty violent but this and dark atmosphere of Watchmen make it an intensive experience. The whole scenario with the fallen Superheros is great but it has been told pretty often since the Watchmen comic narrate it for the first time.I rate this movie very high even now after I read it because it can compete with the comic pretty good and beholding the fact that so many people in my environment (even comic readers) don't know Watchmen this movie is not only great it also draws deserved attention to a great graphic novel.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

The trailers lead me to believe this would indeed be the Dark Knight, Spiderman, Ironman, something, some movie about comic book heroes that was action packed. Nothing could be further from the truth. This was a drama, a long, boring, drama with 20% of the action you'd find in your normal spy movie. I definitely don't recommend it to anyone looking for a good summer action movie, it's definitely not.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"""Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?""","It is...a most interesting version of 1985. Nixon has been president for FAR too long, the Soviet Union struggles with the West over control of Afghanistan, and crime and social upheaval are at an all time high.And, oh yeah, superheroes exist.However, superheroes have problems, just like anyone else. The most notable of super teams, the Minute Men, had long passed their glory days and handed the torch to the next generation, whose problems were so severe that they wound up disbanded.But now, the murder of a veteran member causes these new Watchmen to unite again, with the purpose of solving said murder, and perhaps, saving the world once again.As different as the source material upon which this movie was based proved to be, I never really liked it. I knew very little of the mysterious writer Alan Moore at the time that I read it (somewhere between high school and college), but he would go on to write works that I enjoyed much more. I gained an appreciation for the dark themes and the social mirrors he explores. But after two readings, I found this particular story somewhat abrupt and naive.Now, a movie comes along. Surprise, surprise, it proves effective.Don't go expecting the typical comic book nonsense (aside from Christopher Nolan's take on Batman, and a scant few other examples, that is) to which we've been exposed up to this point. In fact, it's most effective if you attend with no expectations at all. This prompts me to wave a BIG flag before parents--it's rated R for a reason. In fact, there are many reasons.Some solid performances abound in a cast of actual character actors rather than stars. In particular, talking head followers should enjoy the fine actors portraying The MacLaughlin Group and Ted Koppel. The musical choices pull you in to the narrative, reflecting the troubled era well. (Who would have thought that a Bob Dylan tune would be such a powerful intro?) The film is faithful to the source material to no grammatical fault.This is one problem critics have had with the film already. One such critic, whose review I thought was rather good otherwise, put forth that the photo-play is so faithful to the novel, that it lacks any spirit of its own. I don't necessarily argue with that, but I do differ with the idea that the story is irrelevant due to the passage of time. (Since there's no Soviet Union, etc.) It's the reason for my title. Some will recognize the classic Chicago Transit Authority tune: ""Does anybody really care? And so I can't imagine why, we've all got time enough to die..."" (Kinda surprised they didn't add that one.) If anything, the social and cultural connotations of a story like this are MORE relevant today than ever.In a world facing problems like economic downturn, increasing social upheaval, and families being ruined by a whole lot more than just war, perhaps it is the right time to revisit The Watchmen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
So far the best movie to watch this year,"2008 was a great year for comic book movies but this year isn't looking to good. Watchmen is probably the most anticipated comic book movie of the year which lived to its expectation. I'm into the DC comics and there aren't many films based on the DC universe and Watchmen is added into the list which is why this is one of the most awaited films of the year for me.The story is set in an alternate 1985 America where tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union are high and the ""Doomsday Clock"" is set at five minutes to midnight, former superhero turned vigilante Rorschach discovers that one of his former colleagues has been murdered. As he investigates the murder he uncovers a plot that is intent on killing and discrediting all past and present superheroes. As he reconnects with members of his former crime-fighting legion, including Nite Owl II, Silk Spectre II and Dr. Manhattan, they uncover a wide-ranging and disturbing conspiracy that not only links to their shared past but has catastrophic consequences for the future.Watchmen is such an amazing film that is entertaining and exciting throughout, the story is really appealing and is assembled with glossy professionalism. I really like Zack Snyder's style of film making it is visionary and has lots of slow motions. The slow motion scenes may be annoying for some people but not for me because I think that it makes the scene very effective. The cinematography was excellent and you can see every penny spent from the $120 million budget.Overall Watchmen doe's have something for most people to enjoy and I really intend to watch the movie again on the IMAX because I know that it will be like a dream world in that experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Watchmen A Decent Movie Based On A Graphic Novel,"Let me first start off by saying I've never read any of the Watchmen comics but I thought it was a decent movie based on a graphic novel from director Zack Snyder the man behind films like 300 and the Dawn Of The Dead remake. Snyder does a good job with his attempt to bring this graphic novel to the big screen but a slow pace, the lack of some character development, and overlong running time hurt it the most. Watchmen wasn't the best film I've ever seen but it certainly wasn't the worst either Shutter and The Happening to name a few. The movie takes place in an alternate 1985 America where costumed superheroes are a part of everyday society and tensions with the Soviets maybe leading to a third world war or worse. The cast for the most part are good in their roles including Malin Ackerman as Laurie Jupiter/Silk Spectre 2, Mathew Goode as Adrian Veidt/Ozymandias, and Patrick Wilson as Dan Dreiberg/Nite Owl 2. The three stand outs in the cast are Jackie Earle Haley who turns in a great performance as Walter Kovacs/Rorschach as a determined psychotic masked vigilante whose on a quest for the truth. Billy Crudup is equally impressive as Jon Osterman a scientist who becomes the emotionally distant Dr Manhattan after a bizarre accident turns into a blue superhuman god with amazing powers and the same can go to Jefrrey Dean Morgan as Eddie Blake/The Comedian a twisted cigar smoking psychopathic vigilante whose death kicks off the movie. Morgan isn't in it that much but he's effective in the small role. The rest of the supporting cast including Carla Cugino as Sally Jupiter/Silk Spectre 1, Matt Frewer Edgar Jacobi/Moloch, and Stephen Hattie as Hollis Mason/Nite Owil are okay in their extended appearances but none of them are developed enough like Rorschach, Dr. Manhattan, Dan Drieberg, or Laurie Jupiter. The actor who played Richard Nixon was all right but I think they went over the top with him especially with his nose. People expecting a lot of action maybe be disappointed because there is enough of it but this film seemed to be more about the story which isn't necessarily a bad thing I guess. The action/fight sequences the movie does have are well executed none the less but nothing we haven't really seen before. The eventual twist as to the identity of the one who killed the Comedian I sort of saw coming but you might not. The sex scene between Wilson and Ackerman is steamy but it felt kind of unnecessary and the music playing while they're doing it didn't match at all. But Ackerman still looked great in either a leather outfit or without it. The film had a slow pace and the running time 162 minutes made it feel long which are two things that weighed it down the most. The movie is still worth seeing at least once because of the exceptional performances by Jackie Earle Haley and Bill Crudup. Despite some flaws Watchmen isn't really that bad of a movie it just could've been better. Watchmen has action, fist fights, blood, bone crushing hits, and good performances by the cast who make this graphic novel turned into a movie worth watching at least once as long as you can get past the overlong running time first.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Must be seen in its ULTIMATE CUT version,"SO much has been written here, that I'm not going to reiterate.. But haters and lovers alike really owe it to themselves to watch the 215 minute Ultimate Cut edition of this movie (not to be confused with the Director's Cut). Adding the animation plus additional scenes (and even a better Blu-Ray transfer than previous releases) has much so much more depth to both some characters as well as motivations, that it becomes easily one of the best costumed hero films ever made...better than DARK KNIGHT, IMHO.

"Amazing visuals, but maybe not one for the Moore-ist purists","The original Watchmen comic is an enduring classic, and it has its passionate fans. Many of them were not pleased with this adaptation. Maybe because the extended DVD version was my first exposure to it, I am not in agreement with this view. (The DVD I had came with a video version of the comic, something which comic book purists probably also dislike, but I thought it was very cool.) Contrary to what the Alan Moore worshippers think, I thought this was excellent. This is up there among the weirdest and most visually exciting flicks ever. The story mixes both a dark, semi-realistic take on the super hero genre with alternate history. The tale is built up around 4 unforgettable characters: the Comedian (imagine if the Joker was one of the good guys, but retained his nasty nature), Dr. Manhattan (a super-superman created in a radioactive accident), Rorschach (an uncompromising crime fighter with a mask made up of ever shifting Rorschach ink blots), and Adrian Veidt (a cold genius who comes up with a unique and horrible way to save the human race from itself). One could complain about some unnecessary violence and the treatment of a couple of the female characters - point taken there - but this is still a festival of stunning imagery and unique storytelling.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A stunning and powerful adaptation of the best graphic novel ever made!,"Let me start off by saying that I saw the Director's Cut of Watchmen, so this review is based solely on the DC. Watchmen is a film that might enrage a lot of people who were expecting to see an action film. The novel is a very provocative and very complex look at the superhero life. A lot of the superheroes are very flawed, and unlikeable as well. The film explores the basin of the world they live in, and the problems facing them and everyone else at that time. The novel is filmed almost entirely scene-by-scene into the film, and I am glad it was so faithful. I thought the film was brilliantly written and executed, almost to perfection. Yes, it is true that a lot of things said in a comic book can sound and look totally ridiculous on film, but I thought Watchmen did not have those problems. Of course, the context of the film is not as subtle as the novel, no film ever could, but it reaches pretty damn close, and for that, I am grateful. Many scenes work very well,and those that do not work in the same way as the novel work in their own right. A large part of why the film is as brilliant as it is is because of Zack Snyder. While I enjoyed Snyder's 300, it was pretty much always style over substance, with no real character development or plot. However, he was perfect for Watchmen. He gave it his 'flair', and you can see the similarities to 300, the slow-motion action, the shots, but I thought it all worked very well. While the graphic novel is very dense and not mainstream at all, it does hit upon some moments of action and thrills, and Snyder directed those moments in his own way. I thought it all worked, especially the new ending.The performances in the film are simply great. I have heard many complaints about how the acting is not what people envisioned for Watchmen, but I have to say, from all the actors that could have taken these great characters, I am glad these did. Jackie Earle Haley, Billy Crudup, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan are the ones getting the raves they deserve. All three was spot-on from the novel, and I do think they all deserve serious awards recognition, especially Haley who has given the single best performance of 2009 so far. His mannerisms and expressions are exactly what I imagined for Rorschach. The same for Morgan and Crudup, both incredibly great. I also want to recognize three other great performances- Matthew Goode, Patrick Wilson, and Carla Gugino. Personally, I loved Ozymandias in the novel, and I was afraid how Goode would portray him. I thought he was brilliant. I actually think he gave justice to the character in a whole different way that i envisioned him. I think he was just as great as Haley, Crudup, and Morgan. Patrick Wilson plays Nite Owl II, which was actually my least favorite superhero of the novel. I thought Wilson gave it his all best, and made him even better in the film. I thought he played him with doubt, fear, and confusion, and was great at it. Also making him the most likable of the bunch, since his character, also Silk Spectre II are the most likable and least flawed of them. Carla Gugino was brilliant in her character. Like with Goode, she portrayed the first Silk Spectre in a different way than I would have thought, and I loved it. Now to Malin Akerman, who is being picked as the weakest in the cast. She was not as great as the other five, but seeing her character, no actress would ever be. But I thought she was very good. She did have some flaws, although I think it was some flaws in her dialogue at times. But overall, I thought she pulled it off. I was expecting something much worse than I got, because she really was not bad at all. The rest of the supporting cast are all great, but the stand-outs are all pretty much said already.Now to the technical aspects. Watchmen has amazing visual and sound effects. I thought the scenes in Mars with Jon and Laurie was very true to the novel, and I loved it. Dr. Mahnattan's body glow, and his whole appearance was pretty much perfect. I loved the music in this film completely. While I did think the score towards the end was a bit too high and mainstream, I get why Snyder is doing it. But I do not really hold it against him, since the studio at least let him do this film. The opening credits, showing us a lot of the superhero world and from 1930-1985, with Bob Dylan's 'The Times They Are A 'Changin' was absolutely my favorite opening credits in years! The music put throughout the film was also great. And from all of the controversy, I seriously thought that the 'Blue Penis' was barely shown. I seriously did not notice it, and I cannot believe all the fuss it created. It was nothing! I thought the ending credits' song, from My Chemical Romance, was unfit in the story.Overall, here it is! Watchmen the film, and I am so pleased with the way it turned out. For those who said it was unfilmable, well, they were wrong. I also think some of the criticism pointed towards the film is unjust, and cannot believe some critics did not like it. But again, I saw the Director's Cut, so I cannot really know how the theatrical version turned out. Bravo to Zack Snyder for giving us fans, and the rest of the world, the film about the Watchmen!",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"A good movie, but nobody seems enticed to want to watch it again","A good movie, but not a great movie, for peculiar reasons. I put this about on the same level as most of the Lord of the Rings movies, and with somewhat similar types of detractions. The concept and the script are solid, and it generally looks well done, but where I start to stall out is that most of the male actors struck me as either so-so depictions, or just misinterpreted. If you are going to attempt to interpret such a well known and widely read graphic novel, you have to get these strongly defined characters right on the money. Forget director's vision, because if you don't nail these personalities, or at least make them stronger rather than weaker than the source material, viewers are going to be keyed right into this right off the bat. So here is what came immediately to mind as I watched this: Having Rorschach sounding exactly like Nolan's Batman was an unfortunate distraction that was impossible for me to ignore. Next, Doctor Manhattan as being somewhat melancholy would have been ok if it was clear that he is too advanced to feel attachment to normal life, but in this movie he crosses the line into seeming sort of dumpy, with a ""poor me"" demeanor. He completely loses his appeal, and yet apparently committed to his weightlifting routine. Comedian wasn't nearly as coldly psychopathic as he needed to be as the initial driving force behind the movie. And finally Ozymandias, who was just merely there. On the other hand, I would say that Carla Gugino as Sally Jupiter and Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl were both excellent.I think the changes in the script were ok. Normally this is something that I hate in movies, but here I think the story actually needed to simplify the script a bit at the end. Audiences aren't brilliant, and Moore's original story has a relatively complex idea behind its finale. As such, this more straight forward and obvious ending was probably a good idea, but I completely understand why Moore probably hated it.The other key problem for me was with the prominence of the soundtrack. It's too rich. Iconic, generation defining songs being used in any movie is a gamble as to whether your audience buys into this, and Watchmen uses a LOT of very historic, culture shaping songs. This can only work -sometimes- in movies, but it opens up a strong possibility of creating a polemic in the viewers mind. Everyone has heard these songs, and everyone is going to have a very specific association of whether these songs are good, bad, or whether they really fit the scene. For the most part, I think this movie bit off more than it could chew. Ultimately it breaks the suspension of belief. The Watchmen jumping right in trying to harness Bob Dylan's The Times They Are A-Changin' was a completely ill-fitted choice, as was The Sound of Silence, and Hallelujah. At best these songs jerk the viewer out of the movie, and at worst it makes your audience dislike the scenes they are shoehorned into because the context is all wrong.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Watchmen gave me blue balls,"The Watchmen gave me blue balls just like Dr. Manhattan's. That is to say I appreciated the effort but I left a little sore. Zack Snyder's film isn't without its merits, there are some good performances and some really stunning visuals despite the some of the CG being about as realistic as a Command & Conquer cinematic. It has many flaws. While this is a very faithful adaptation, perhaps to a fault (I'd be curious to see how Darren Aronofsky's contemporary version would have played out) they sure did throw out the ending. This film's ending diverges from the source material in a very disappointing way. Doing it the way it is written would have probably cost more money, and I think that may have been a concern because I don't think anyone hired a music director. Instead I think Snyder opted to hook his iPod up to the Avid and press shuffle. The music is spastic, and really in cohesive. One piece of music seemed to fit a rainy neon filled night pretty well and it sounded like Vangelis. Where have a heard that before? Oh yeah Blade Runner. This movie is It's borderline satirical when it could have taken itself more seriously. The action is very heavy handed. The fights are way over the top with a lot of wire work. ZACK SNYDER IS AN OVERCRANKING RAMP FIEND , I get it! Things look cool in slow motion; check out the show Time Warp on the discovery channel. All in all this film is entertaining because it is derived from a really brilliant piece of fiction and in a distilled less intelligent way the film successfully brings it to life. It's worth watching the Watchmen, but it is not the film it could have been.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Wow, never thought that it was possible.","After i went out of the cinema I was really confident with this movie evening. Like many other, I'm a great fan of Moores graphic novels. Watchmen was always my favourite. The same goes for the movie. I knew that a movie will never give the same expression and message like the graphic novel. But Znyder found a way to convert the message and the universe of Watchmen in moving pictures. I'm really grateful to Znyder that he didn't obey to the studios and stood in for an exact adaption of the scenario.This movie has a message, stylish/funny moments, action, great characters and strong violence. Especially the last point could be a problem for the movie especially the female part of the audience gasped at these moments and i got the impression that they hated/disliked these moments. This strong violence is typical for Znyder's movies so be prepared if you watch one of them.I really enjoyed this whole movie and it stands for me on the same stage(or even higher) like ""Dark Knight"" in the genre of hero movies.I hope that it will be successful because this movie is really special and a brave experiment of the producers (hell they gave Znyder over 200.000.000 bucks) and the director. Please support this bravery because this movie doesn't follow the typical Hollywood stereotypical rules.This movie wasn't a perfect adaption of the novel but it is a great movie! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
The best 'hero' movie until now.,"! This is a review for the ultimate cut of the movie and not the cinema version !Zack Snyder's movies have by now become synonymous with a unique aesthetic, loved by some and hated by others, and this movie is certainly no exception. It is however hard to deny that Snyder accomplished to fulfill his creative vision here, maybe more than on any other movie he has made, giving it an experience, that one can hardly compare with anything else.The intro sequence alone is absolutely outstanding, and in my opinion on of the best ever made. In it, 45 years of American history are retold using animated historical pictures, that have been changed in a way that encapsulates how the Watchmen/Minutemen took part in creating the alternate world that the Comic-Universe is set in. If you for some reason decide not to watch this movie, I highly recommend watching the intro scene nonetheless. It can easily be found on YouTube.The universe of Watchmen is dark and mature, in a way that I didn't even think the Batman movies by Christopher Nolan have been. A major part of the movie doesn't even bother to follow a straight line, and instead uses its time for worldbuilding, to show the background of many characters and their respective moral. And it really isn't very hard to tell why this is done; because Watchmen really is about worldbuilding and philosophy.And like any good movie about philosophy it doesn't bother to give answers, but instead takes its time to explain problems and views, as well as the world that they are set in.All this is only supported by the animated movie, in the movie, Tales of the Black Freighter. It tells a story that at first glance doesn't seem to have any relation to the rest of the movie, but does in fact weave together with the themes of the main movie in the end. And after all this contrast doesn't take the wind out of the main plot line either, since the film doesn't build a lot on the main plot anyway.Furthermore, it's hardly possible to even say who the protagonist of the movie was, and it gets even harder to nail the philosophy of the movie down to one certain question.To experience this groundbreaking approach to movies in general, as well as a truly outstanding science-fiction world, I highly recommend watching this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Dark - but no ""Dark Knight""","I don't do graphic novels so I haven't read the 1986/87 ""Watchmen"" comics/book by British writer Alan Moore, but I'm a huge fan of superhero films so there was no way I was going to miss the movie adaptation, especially as it is directed by the young American Zack Snyder whose ""300"" I enjoyed so much. It is certainly well worth viewing since, in many respects, ""Watchmen"" is a true original - a film like no other you've seen before. It is a visual treat, irredeemably dark, outrageously violent, frequently bloody, sometimes sexy, and featuring an eclectic soundtrack.These are superheros who depart big time from the standard. They may have two identities, which is almost compulsory, but - except for superb fighting skills - they actually lack super powers, with the notable exception of Dr Manhattan who is not so much a superhero as a kind of god, and these are deeply flawed 'heroes', vindictive and violent, who - at worst - rape and murder.Set in a counter-factual 1985 version of America, it is hard to know which is scarier - the idea of Nixon winning a third term, avoiding Watergate and winning the Vietnam war or the threat of nuclear Armageddon from a US/USSR conflict and difficult to know which is more incredible - that exposing one man to radiation can turn him into a demi-god or that humankind can cope so easily with the nuclear obliteration of 15 million (the largest death toll in any movie in history?). In the end, it didn't quite work for me, mainly because the narrative is so disjointed and the finale insufficiently dramatic. The current benchmark of quality for superhero movies is ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Watchmen"" simply does not have the pacing, excitement and virtuoso acting of that movie.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Difficult homage achieved; whether it's an enjoyable film or not...,"...will depend on your viewpoint of the original material.I'll leave the plot line synopsis to others and just focus on my thoughts and what I've gleaned from listening to others opinions.Storyline: for the fan, 8 stars; for the general public, 5 stars. If you read ""Watchmen"" you'll appreciate the storyline and recognize almost every scene in the context of the book. I'm sure people who haven't read the source material will have a much harder time appreciating or even following the story.Part of the ""wow"" factor of ""Watchmen"" the graphic novel was the incredible attention to detail that drew so many disparate elements together over the course of the book. Necessarily, much of that material had to be pared down for the movie. (Not all to the bad in my opinion--I always thought the ""Black Ship"" subplot detracted from the pacing of the main storyline, though I understand how it fit into the original work.) Audience members who were most disappointed seemed to have expected a standard superhero flick, and were not familiar with Moore's book.Fidelity to the book: 9 stars The film does distill that main storyline extremely well: the vast majority of scenes and dialog are taken directly from the book, and the director did a fine job of trimming non-essential material, yet still found a way to include it as set pieces, cameos and homages to the novel. For fans of the book, all the essential elements are there, though many are given short shrift, especially Hollis Mason's tale. I found myself smiling as I recognized devices from the graphic novel given their few seconds of life on screen.One critique: Though the novel is dark, bleak and violent, the movie is actually much more graphic in its depiction of that violence. Fight scenes are longer and the camera dwells on the blood, broken bones and severed limbs. This enhanced gore is the one aspect of the film that I feel is unnecessary and detracts from the whole.Nevertheless, I think the feel of Moore's ""Watchmen"" shines through this condensed film quite clearly. With the one caveat above, I don't think that could have been better accomplished.Performances: 6.5 stars In general, the actors turned in good performances, though some of the characters did fall a bit short of Moore's characterizations. This isn't necessarily the actors' fault, as there isn't time to give six main characters equal treatment. I would say that Malin Akerman as Laurie and Matthew Goode as Veidt were credible, but nothing more. I thought Patrick Wilson did more with Nite Owl than what he was given, and rendered probably the most believable and true to character performance. Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach also rose above Moore's somewhat purple dialog and his obscuring mask and delivered a compelling character on screen. Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan is appropriately distant and restrained, but that makes it hard to move beyond the dialog and expand the character. Jeffery Dean Morgan played The Comedian as sociopath very well.Film making: 8 stars The cinematography and special effects brought the setting of the book to life, from the Gunga Diner to Jon's palace on Mars to Dreiburg's Owl Ship. Dr. Manhattan is probably the only jarring element to me. The CG animation was a bit off; the figure's movements weren't quite correct, and I never forgot I was looking at CG enhancement. Others have mentioned the full frontal male nudity as distracting and I have to agree, though I think that's mostly from it's rarity in American films (and perhaps some shared embarrassment from watching it in a crowded theater). I think it's more a comment on our immaturity than a criticism of the movie--what need has an Indestructible Man of clothing, and in the book it's shorthand for Dr. Manhattan's increasing detachment from humanity and it's concerns. In any case it isn't sexually provocative.Wrap Up: 7.5 stars/4 stars Overall, I think the screenwriters and director have created an homage to Moore's work; given the incredible difficulty of bringing that story to film (let alone as a commercial studio release), I think it's remarkable how well they achieved that goal in a 2:45 movie and worthy of 9 stars. Yes, they took some liberties with the story and certainly some economy in the material, but what would you have them do? Deliver a 15-hour opus that would be unwatchable and unintelligible but for a handful of true believers? Not very realistic, and not a better alternative either, in my opinion.If you liked Moore's ""Watchmen"" (and you're not an irrational fan-boy screaming about purity), go see the movie--you'll enjoy it on the big screen.If you've never heard of the book, you should probably skip it--those in the audience so inclined at the screening I attended seemed bored or disgusted..DEFINITELY, leave your kids at home. This film earns its ""R"" rating, not only for its dark and violent nature, but also for the morally ambiguous tone throughout; the resolution at the end is also something that children would not be expected to accept as appropriate.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Hmm, not so good.","I saw this because of the reviews on this site. I had seen the trailer and dismissed it as another DC Comics/Comicon/X Men/Dark Knight/you name it wanna-be and I've seen enough for a while thanks. But the reviews were up there at 8.5 so I spent my bucks and went along expecting to be surprised. I was surprised by the amount of gore. The sex scene surprised me too. It also surprised my kids. Unfortunately those weren't pleasant surprises - and I am definitely not a prude but the sex and so much violence were so blatantly gratuitous that I really wondered what the other reviewers had seen in the movie. The plot was indecipherable for the first 15-20 minutes then finally one of the characters explained something and I got the general idea - ex-super (but not really super) heroes with character flaws...um... retired because of a law forbidding the wearing of masks. Richard Nixon was in there somewhere, too. And now in 1985 - the 'now' - of the movie...with Nixon still President... um right - someone was killing the ex-superheroes. But then the next character explained something else and I lost it again. Meanwhile one of the ex-superheroes isn't ex because he's building some energy thing to save the world while Russia and the US are about to destroy each other... he glows blue and talks like an announcer in a shopping mall and he wants to live on Mars.... It makes me weary just trying to sort that much to write it down and that's just the back-story, sort of... Wow. Well, anyway, I thought it was all just way over the top, way over-produced, some occasional good acting but way too gory, way too jarring for no good reason at all, way, way WAY too corny in the last 20 minutes.

I went expecting loads of action, great story lines and just all around mouth dropping greatness. I was honestly sorely mistaken. I feel as though the previews took every good scene of the movie and the rest were just filler. There are some really good scenes that weren't from the trailer, particularly those of Rorschach but other parts just seemed so useless.The action was great when it was there, and the graphics were amazing, but that seems like all it was. I felt they were trying to hard with the slow-motion shots and the dramatic effects. It was almost like they were using it solely because it was what made 300 so popular. But it was overdone, I believe. The acting I felt was great, but I could have done without the sex scenes (one in particular) It just felt silly to watch really. Maybe its more of a GN fan kind of thing, because some people really enjoyed it *rolls eyes* The soundtrack was interesting, it was appropriate when you stopped to think about it, but when you first heard each song it sort of made you pause and ask, ""really?""

how super hero movies should be,"From a time when the Synder's actually cared about the quality of movies.Dark, society critical, twisted, dystopic, neo-noir, brave.Even the most powerful superhero can be outsmarted,

All of the heros have enough screen time.
The characters are deep and the dialogues, monologues are fitting.

It's visuals are dazzling, it's acting performances excellent across the board, and it delivers a full-circle story. While some might find it slow or self-important, this is a movie that is truly unique in substance and artistic merit. Truly a treat of a film, and if it had come out 10 years later its dark presentation and thematic meditation would probably have been more well appreciated and understood.

Graphic novel on film,"The film's deliberate use of visual motifs, such as the recurring symbols and distinctive panel-like compositions, further enhances the graphic novel ambiance. The seamless integration of these elements fosters a sense of continuity with the source material, immersing the audience in a world that mirrors the dynamic visual storytelling found in graphic novels.Additionally, Snyder's meticulous attention to character nuances and intricate plot details mirrors the way readers engage with the layers of a graphic novel. This commitment to depth ensures that Watchmen is not merely a visual adaptation but a rich, multi-dimensional exploration of the original work's complexities.

Zack Snyder's most 'Zack Snyder' movie.,"'Watchmen (2009)' is certainly a mixed bag. Some moments are great, some moments are poor and the end result resides somewhere in between. It's probably Zack Snyder's most 'Zack Snyder' movie, but it's also probably his best. Each and every moment feels obsessed with seeming 'cool', stretched out with Snyder's signature slow motion and visual tinkering. Most images resemble the panels of its source comic an impressive amount, comparable almost 1:1 in many cases. This gives the film its distinct style but it also causes it to feel oddly slow; it revels in each moment, rolling around in its self-serious visual splendour. It all feels rather self-congratulatory, constantly content with itself. While its imagery is definitely an achievement, it seems like the sole focus. The story is messy and structurally unsound, oddly paced and severely back-loaded. The majority of its runtime is dedicated to what's essentially exposition, as the piece makes a point of introducing the alternate-history world and satirical superhero characters that will be at stake in its final third. When things finally get going, it's rather interesting and enjoyable. Its relatively nuanced finale is only marred by the fact that its majority is conveyed through dialogue-based exposition. The antagonist reveals his entire plan in typically bad guy fashion, explaining his motivations to the characters and audience alike, while making a point of saying that he isn't a 'comic-book villain'. Luckily, it's rather intriguing and has a subversive payoff. The finale is probably the most cohesive part of the entire picture. The rest sort of feels cobbled together, comprised of clunky story and bone-cracking action. It also feels long, with several moments practically screaming to be cut (the final scene is detrimentally elongated by a random Ronald Reagan gag, for example). However, there are several set-pieces that practically burn themselves into your brain, remaining long after the plot has slipped from memory. A stand-out is Dr. Manhattan's always-happening origin story, which feels like a complete short in and of itself. It's this kind of storytelling that the movie excels at, even if it never quite trusts its audience. It seems to misunderstand the comic's satirical view, though; there are several incredibly earnest scenes that don't have a hint of irony. The character Nite Owl suffers the most from this, his earnest boy-scout dialogue being treated with the same scene-chewing sincerity as everyone else's. Wilson does a good job with what he has, though. So does Haley, who manages to deliver his purposely over-worked noir narration with conviction and confidence. Crudup does well playing a blue-skinned, god-like being losing touch with his humanity and Morgan manages to bring a slimy, sort of sickening charm to his near-comically evil character. Goode is good at hamming it up, Akerman is decent, if unremarkable, and Gugino is underused but as good as ever. The whole cast do a good job of elevating the affair's less successful moments but they can't quite save everything. There are some really cringe-worthy elements and, at times, the thing is almost boring. It's always just about engaging enough, though. In general, it's typically entertaining. Its traditionally 'superhero' action is well-conceived, if out of place, and its tone is typically consistent. Ultimately, the experience is too long and too uneven for its own good, but it's still a good effort, especially for an adaptation of an 'unfilmable' book. It's worth a watch. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
An good example of what is an amazing movie,"Zack Snyder gave the world something Dr. Manhattan would deem a miracle: a superb comic-book based film.Written In 1985 by the experienced author Alan Moore, the graphic novel Watchmen was critical in setting the high standart for the comics we see today, iniciating the current modern age of comics. Therefore it must have proved rather difficult for Mr. Snyder to make a dedicated movie able to live up to it's standarts. In my opinion, it did.From the awe inducing scenes to its stunning use of music and sound, Watchman is able to take the viewer through the consistent and yet surprising motivations of its characters. The movie's plot is centered around two generations of super heroes and the choices they make after a mandatory retirement. A full 180° range of motivations are present, from the imense blind disgust Rorsharch feels towards injustice to Dr. Manhattans almost complete indeference towards Humankind.The story flows through the movie with elegance, with frequent flashbacks and references to keep sharp the viewers attention, as does the grim and thought provocking atmosphere that keeps us on our toes. Folks with an interest on politics will likewise enjoy the movies take on 20th century American government policies.Although the acting was only average, the attention to the smallest of details in every scene, the great use of colour and lighting and the extremely well positioned shots gives the viewer a full immersion through the otherwise tedious two hours and forty two minutes. I do have to congratulate one actor though, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who distinguished himself while portraying his role as the Comedian.Overall, I think Zach Snyder did an excellent job, as did most of the crew involved in the project. I consider this movie very well edited and directed, and although the acting isn't anything special, the dialog is wonderful, the scenes are breathtaking and plot flourishes throughout the 2h and 42m. I rate this movie 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Pretentious, self-indulgent, incomprehensible tripe","With all the hype of a long-awaited movie adaptation, I came in with little expectation despite my tepid impression of the trailer.It turns out this film is slow, pretentious (more on that later), and grotesquely self-indulgent. A fairly good script, co-written by prodigiously talented David Hayter who scripted X-Men movie and voice-acted as Snake in Metal Gear Solid series, has been marred by the film being so overproduced and overdirected it's like watching a farce. For those who are not familiar with the comic book, Watchmen will appear to be one of the weirdest movies ever made, outside of Terry Gilliam's realm. Terry actually tried to adapt the film in development hell in 1986 and 1989, but the project fell apart.The plain truth is, because of the complexities of Watchmen as a comic book in terms of literal reading experience (that elevates mature comic book to art form), it is unadaptable. The result of the movie adaptation with bizarre & outlandish plot and character arcs is disastrous. The movie is not a clever satire or plausible fantasy as it pretends to be, but rather a preposterously inane farce.Comic book and film are entirely different art forms, with comic adaptations of the movies weak and awful (i.e. Marvel's Terminator 2) and vice versa. The exception would be well-produced and freely styled adaptation of comic books such as X-Men 2, Ghost World, Iron Man and The Dark Knight.Zack Snyder throws in the gimmicks reminiscent of music video editing styles, with slow motion and cranking motion for dramatic effects. He dwells on the scenes of grotesque violence in slow motion, as though he loves violence, pain and suffering because it's about making acts of violence stylishly appealing contrary to the reality where violence is cruel and uncool. The opening credit sequence may be weirdly cool, but unabashedly pretentious. Zack wants to tell the world he's a ""cool"" movie director who made a zombie movie re-make and an over-hyped box office hit (300) which I called ""fascist art"" in a previous review posted on IMDb.The filmmakers' love of stylish graphic violence in close-ups, with slow and crank motions for effect, is repulsive. I thought Watchmen is supposed to be an action drama film, but it feels like watching an action movie that interchanges with grisly horror elements, pretending to dispense philosophical ideas of existence. I like nihilism, but not with sociopathic adulation of grisly movie violence as though there's any point. Not to mention an unnecessary, semi-pornographic sex scene that went on a minute too long, which again does not serve to advance the plot, only titillate the audience to discomforted silence.Watchmen is overlong with some pacing tedium in-between, which makes it obvious the film is not tightened. Zack thought padding the length would make the film at least comprehensible in storytelling, but he fails to consider re-editing because he wants to remain as ""slavishly faithful"" to the comic book as possible, much to the annoyance of the audience who had not bothered to read the comic book.With the film's flaws as the factor because of the director's sheer indulgence, Watchmen is a fascinating train wreck to watch, from the point of view of a casual comic book reader and current college student in philosophy. Fanboys' adulation of the film as a ""masterpiece"" expose them to be shallow ""me"" generation who think those who criticize Watchmen the movie for whatever reason are uninformed, uncultured morons.Watchmen author Alan Moore was right to demand credit removal as noticed in the opening credit sequence, with the artist Dave Gibbons' sole credit as ""co-creator."" Because Watchmen is an awful, ludicrously nonsensical movie that will confound the people who has never read the comic book to begin with. I accept the alternative timeline storyline, but the aesthetics of the film is too surreal as a patently absurd fantasy.The movie is proof some source materials should be left alone because a ""good"" adaptation in another art form is improbable. Therefore, I agree with Alan Moore's protest because it rapes the novel aesthetics of a story meant to be a compelling experience in original art form as intended.* out of 4",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
From Graphic Novel to Cinema,The Watchmen graphic novel is one of my favorite comic book stories. The Crow and Maus. So to translate it to film would be a challenge. I wasn't expecting much as I've been disappointed by many of these type of films in the genre. Frankenstein Jaws are fantastic representative of the books. I've seen this in the theatre and liked it However. The ultimate cut was a masterpiece ! I'm not a fan of the Batman Superman JLA loved 300 but he definitely didn't graphic novel justice. I know Alan Moore is super upset about the way he was treated and wants nothing to do with the industry hopefully one day we can discuss this wonderful creation.

"'Hello Mr. Snyder, is that another over-hyped mainstream display of laziness in your pocket?'","The word visionary, is a poor label to slap on Snyder. I would give him credit for it in '300' being that I've not read the book for it, but in the instance of 'Watchmen', I have read and greatly enjoyed the graphic novel. Whilst reading it I was unsurprised that a movie was being made, and was also unsurprised that Snyder would be directing. But from the point I heard his name, my expectations started to drop. Having seen, and been greatly dissatisfied by, '300' and 'Dawn of the Dead' (His biggest previous hits) I couldn't say I was expecting too much directionally from 'Watchmen'.Often when low expectations are in order, they are exceeded particularly easily. However they were matched, and actually having read the graphic novel, I saw exactly what kind of director Snyder is. He is a lazy one. Pretty much for all of his shots, he used the graphic novel as a storyboard. He used practically no creativity in creating his shots; he just took them straight out of the book and slapped them onto the big screen. This does not make Snyder a visionary; this makes him a very lazy boy, as well as a cop-out. I can only assume this was his vague attempt at appealing to fans of the novel, when fans have already been drawn in by the name of the film.The film also lacked a lot of the depth that the book had. The film had an onslaught of flashback sequences establishing characters psyche, and the way they are in the present time frame. While somewhat necessary to the depth of character, there are many more inventive ways of establishing the same sense of character, and this is once again laziness, but on the hands of screenwriters David Hayter and Alex Tse. However, while these flashbacks gave great depth of character to the cast members who could act well, it detracted very heavily from the main story, which is where the depth is lacking the most.In the novel, the story is a very well executed consistently running undertone. In the film it is a poor one. We start with an introduction to the main plot, and then it seems to be practically dropped for all the flashbacks and character establishment. By the end the main plot is wrapped up far too quickly, with minimal and static development which could easily leave new audiences a little bemused and clueless as to what happened, as well as how and why.The shining performance here is without a doubt, Jackie Earle Haley. Haley plays 'Rorschach', the darkest and deepest character, and his performance throughout is absolutely perfect. Not only does he portray the character well from the book, but he simply performs brilliantly as an actor. Billy Crudup also gave a fantastic performance as 'Dr. Manhattan', his facial expressions and attenuate display of emotion is executed superbly. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for most of the other cast, in particular Malin Akerman, who plays 'Silk Spectre II'. Whilst she is without a doubt the most stereotypical character in the novel, this is no reason why she cannot perform well. She is greatly unimpressive. Patrick Wilson lacked something too. He's not a terrible actor from what I've seen before, but it feels as if he is lacking something as 'Nite Owl II'. It is possible that this is down to Snyder's direction, but could equally be Wilson's fault.Whilst overall depth is lost, with only two exceptional performances, and replicated camera work; it can't be faulted that the special effects are stunning. The effects are quite thrilling, but the thrill isn't really felt too much, it's eye candy with no heart. The fight scenes with gratuitous violence, 'Rorschach's unorthodox methods of acquiring information, and almost anything involving 'Dr. Manhattan' (in particular, obliterating Vietcong with a single thought), made for a visually pleasing set of scenes, even if the cinematography is just an uninventive replication.Though, these scenes are simply not enough. Due to the lack of story depth, it leaves most in-between scenes feeling underdeveloped and a little tedious; perhaps not so much for fans of the novel, but especially for new audiences. It feels like they tried to simply replicate the graphic novel as is, whilst taking odd bits out here and there. For new audiences this will create a feeling of emptiness, due to the fact that there are subtle nuances within the book that might not seem valuable, but add to the character as well as story, and are thus actually important.As a companion to the book, this is pretty entertaining and works well, being that fans will know what is going on and are able to fill in any blanks. But for new audiences, especially those who've never heard of 'Watchmen' before, this will just seem tedious, undeveloped and perhaps just a little bit messy with some visual high-points around. Added to this, the soundtrack was particularly 'try-hard', including Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah' during a notably cheesy love scene. As well as some dreadful rock song over the end credits. This seemed distinctly detached from the rest of the film, especially given the time period.Overall, this works best as a companion to the book and is mostly fan orientated. But for new audiences I don't really recommend it, for there will be disappointment and emptiness. Personally, I must admit that I was reasonably entertained by the film, but I feel this is because I am a fan of the novel, and therefore know the ins and outs of the story. But it doesn't really do the book much justice to be perfectly honest. I'll be keeping an eye out for Jackie Earle Haley, but I won't be rushing out to see this film again. This is a fairly unimpressive 6 out of 10; an uncreative, lazy, near beat-for-beat replication.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Good adaptation,"It surpassed my expectations, which wasn't difficult because being as this is one of my all time favorite pieces of literature I was very concerned about the adaptation, and Snyder did a more than passable job. The cinematography is terrific, and the dystopian atmosphere of the comics is transferred with bone-chilling effectiveness, as is the moral ambiguity.Unfortunately, Watchmen does, ultimately, remain a solid illustration of the novel rather than an independent creation with its own statement. Recommended mainly for fans of the super-hero genre, as others may find it difficult to follow.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Very good for the time it was brought out and stayed true to the graphic comic book,"As an earlier Zack Snyder film, this did a good job of bringing the comic book to life while having a good overall story line.Even though there were not many (to any) of the top actors in it, the general cast did a pretty good job of acting with the script they had. I thought there was a lot more that could have been added to the story or to another sequel film in a series of Watchmen films, but this one off was good enough for me.The best part to me at least was the photography of the time frame of the period (the 1980's and such) as the sets and overall vintage theme worked well, and again, stayed true to the comic series.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
One of my favorite movies of all time!,"I'll be honest, when I saw the commercials for this movie, I thought that it looked kind of dumb. I had no interest in seeing it in theaters. Keep in mind, I am a huge comic book/superhero movie fanboy. A few years ago, when it was released theatrically, it got mostly positive reviews, but I still had my doubts, so I waited for the DVD to watch it. When it came out, I rented it from Netflix. I put it in the DVD player and was absolutely blown away! From the first scene to the last scene of the movie, I couldn't take my eyes off of the TV screen! The plot was so dark and gritty. The visuals (especially Dr. Manhattan) were absolutely magnificent! The characters are extremely interesting. My favorite is Rorschach! The action sequences had me on the edge of my seat. I also love that there is a ton of dark humor in the movie. I like how they made the movie to be rated R, and that they weren't afraid to show blood and nudity. Overall, Watchmen is a breathtaking experience that I would highly recommend to superhero movie lovers, like me. A+",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Too long and too boring for it's own good.,"The first big blockbuster of 2009 is upon us with Zack Snyder's take on 'Watchmen', one of the biggest graphic novels ever. Snyder has made a movie so large, so massive, and so epic that it collapses under its own weight. There is no denying that it is technically brilliant, much like Snyder's previous 2 efforts - in fact, it is probably his most technically marvelous creation yet - but that doesn't change the fact that Snyder's near 3 hour film is too long for its own good, and despite a story that lives up to its reputation, is unbelievably boring.I was lucky enough to see this movie with a lot of people who read the graphic novel so I got their opinions as well. We all discussed how we felt about it, and they all insisted that I needed to read the novel...that's all well and good, and I'm sure (more like positive) that the novel is indeed legendary, but it appears as if Snyder has pulled a Chris Columbus and made a direct translation from page to screen. What must be understood is that things that work in a novel may not work on a movie screen. You can have two hours of character development in a novel (or the equivalent, I guess), because books are meant to be that long. In a film, you cannot afford to have 2 hours of character development in a movie that runs just under 3 hours. It simply will bore the viewer to bits, especially when the action is few and far between. Don't get me wrong, the characters are all very interesting people that deserve their screen time - but that's what Extended Edition DVDs are for. I have a feeling I'll love this movie on DVD - when I see the full cut and have the ability to pause. In a movie theater setting, however, 'Watchmen' is simply too boring, empty, and heavy to be enjoyed like other comic book movies of late.What drives 'Watchmen' would be the allure of the characters. While some, like Patrick Wilson's, are simply boring ripoffs, the others, such as Jackie Earle Haley's Rorschach and Billy Crudup's Dr. Manhattan, are phenomenal. Those two are easily the best thing about the movie, while Jeffrey Dean Morgan's take on The Comedian is a close third. Each of these actors gives their character their all, including their heart and soul. Haley's turn as Rorschach could be the performance of a lifetime as the ruthless, immoral, yet somehow good hero with a mask as mysterious as his attitude. No matter how cruel his character may be, it is Haley's convictions that assures us of the true goodness of the character.I found myself eagerly awaiting almost any scene with Dr. Manhattan, and while women will obviously enjoy him the most (I'll get to that in a minute), I was particularly impressed with Crudup's ability to channel what might be one of the most emotionally detached character's I've ever seen. Crudup's turn is monotone, but never droll or wooden. It is all the more impressive because the only part of Crudup himself that's in the finished product (besides the flashbacks) would be his facial expressions.While those were the stars of the show, I wish I could say the same for the others. I think Patrick Wilson was confused as to which character he was playing. He played his character as if he was Captain America, instead of trying to carve a niche as a new character. There was nothing I hadn't seen already in this performance. Malin Akerman really needs to stop being like Jessica Alba and being either stupid, wooden, or both. Matthew Goode is the only acceptable one of this bunch.While 'Watchmen' certainly boasts a number of technical marvels, the film is under-edited and feels extremely episodic as a result. Was this Snyder's intention? Did he want to replicate the feeling that original readers got awaiting the next issue? Whether or not that was his goal, it's something he did, and it really bores the viewer to pieces. I really can't stress how flat out bored I got in this movie. Even the action is so sparse and unexciting that I just really couldn't get invested in the film, because I half expected myself to walk out. Yes, the film's editing is terrible...but it is beautifully shot, and just looks like a dream. 'Watchmen' is one of the most visually pleasing films you'll come across...except one...problem...Gratuitous nudity. Was it REALLY necessary to show Dr. Manhattan completely naked in 75% of his scenes? I think that one or two scenes of nudity from him would of been enough, once in the sex scene, and once to get across how detached from humanity he is. My friend told me that it was to show how he didn't care about human emotion and embarrassment, so why would he wear clothing? That's FINE when you're reading it...you can skip to the next page. But in this case, you are pulled out of your experience in the film to say, ""Holy crap, it's a blue c~ck"". It's sad when a simple addition of a cloth could have saved me losing my focus and wondering why it needed to be shown.Is 'Watchmen' the product of a lot of hard work that shows? Yes. Is 'Watchmen' a good movie? In a word, no. It's crippled by a director's need to please a supposedly rabid fanbase with what appeared to me to be a near direct translation from page to screen. I did like the film's ending and story as a whole, but it is extremely hard to become invested in said ending and story because of the fact that 'Watchmen' is a film purely for those who have read the comic, and is extremely boring and overlong. In my eyes, it is a disappointment.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A transcendent movie,"To say Watchmen is a great movie would be an understatement. I have just recently seen this movie's ultimate cut and I must say it is by far my favorite movie. The most short-lived 3.5 hours of my life.This movie is based on a graphic novel that is not for the simple- minded. It is dark in nature and reaches depths filmmakers avoid sharing with the general audience. And by depths I mean mature themes and revealing truths. It has a unique paradoxical taste to it: beautiful yet cynical, and that is the real reason it stands out.I have yet to find a movie that captures so masterfully the different shades of life as we know it. It manages to combine the smallest of details with great precision and the biggest of ideas/themes with striking clearness and honesty and delivers the combo into a beautiful end product. To put this into example: we see in the movie the real nature of humans and the atrocities we are truly capable of, yet we are introduced to some of the most idealistic and platonic characters in comics history. Only to realize that we cannot help but relate to both. Another example of how complex this movie is.And who better to direct such a rich movie than visionary director Zack Snyder himself. Snyder clearly poured his heart out into the movie as he dazzles the world with some of his best scenes yet, which is an impressive achievement considering his acclaimed status as a visionary director. Some scenes are literally breath-taking as they deliver superb visuals backed up by an absorbing score. To explore the intricacies of the comic is a challenge on its own. But to capture them and deliver them with such raw power and purity is a special accomplishment. After all, this is the reason why many have considered this graphic novel to be 'unfilmable'. Exceptional work indeed by Snyder.To sum it up, if you want a movie that will make you feel and think and everything in between, Watchmen is the movie for you. Just remember that it is dark and deals with themes more appropriate for the heavy-thinkers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

2) Experience history to the fullest
3) Give depth to characters in detail
4) Devote time
5) Directe by novel's aesthetic
6) Improvise little but loud
7) Translate protagonists almost identical from source
8) Follow path of narrator's flow
9) ..Never compromiseUndoubtedly, ""Watchmen"" is the crown stone in superhero-based movies.
""The graphic novel, that is impossible to make into a film"" they were saying.
The philosophical questions that Alan Moore raised through his work, it was so unique to see them in an art like comic book. His darkness, his graphic palette, all so unique and asymmetrical with 80's. Everything was attributed to this movie. Some to a large extent and some to a smaller one. Did the ""message"" arrive in time? I think yes! I think the film is there to give things. Is definitely more raw and violent, but the meaning wasn't lost. Not a movie for everyone. But anyone who is willing to see something realistic, will love it.

Is this world worth saving?",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"As an outsider to this world I found it amazing and a bit boring, both. Read on...","Watchmen (2009)This is one of those could-have-been movies. It has stunning graphic effects, great gloomy urban mood, lots of wild and curious characters, a superhero plot laden with doubts and human angst, and some ongoing complexity that makes you pay attention.But there is also an ironic sameness to it all, a similar plodding through, with all the excitement and drama built in all along. There are two large goals to the events.One is establishing the details of a group of superheroes famous from mid-Twentieth Century America. They meet and they talk, but they talk a lot, surprisingly, when you'd rather see something happen. There are flashbacks, lots of them, and good ones, but the point of them is to fill in the characters, and to suggest some lingering personal problems between them in the past (including relationships that have gone wrong). The point of all this is not only to dovetail plot details, but to make the characters very human, whatever their inhuman powers.The second is a current problem in a fictional America, set in the 1970s with Nixon enjoying a third term (and Nixon, Kissinger, and some of the other players of those times make appearances). Nuclear war seem imminent. These retired or dysfunctional superheroes are woken up from their withdrawal from society (earlier forced out of service by a government decree) when one of their group dies (the one who dies, the Comedian, seems actually to be a very bad man overall, not a shining good guy). Something is going wrong, and it seems that these superheroes might be required to act, even illegally, to save themselves.If only their interpersonal squabbles weren't so heavy and damaging. If only they knew who killed the Comedian. If only there was some momentum in this gathering together the past and focussing on the immediate crisis. If only the director had not assumed every viewer was already familiar with the characters, and enamored with them the way you get sucked into comic book heroes.So even though you can't stop watching because it's so visually interesting, the movie gets ponderous at times, many times, and a little overly simple in its psychology and its Cold War plot. I had never heard of the Watchmen or the legendary graphic novel (extended narrative comic book) that precedes the movie. Diving in fresh, I make associations with superheroes I do know (a lot of them, from older comic books and the many movies in the last decade or two). I tried to learn the powers and flaws of this group (they are ambiguous, beyond their fistfighting prowess, men and women both). And there is the exceptional Dr. Manhattan who seems to have God-like powers, waving a hand and disassembling a tank in mid-air then crushing it into a ball of shards without moving from his stiff, upright position, glowing a nice blue radiation of some kind.And stiffness? That's a problem all along. As human as everyone is, they have a kind of cardboard or styrofoam acting style. Oh, I know they are cartoons, but still, emotion becomes suggested or told or acted, not expressed. I'm not sure if this is on purpose, keeping the effect like the emotions in a flat, fake character. (If you don't know comic books at all, picture the ""emotion"" of a person in a Lichtenstein painting--it's a symbolic expression of something, not a real expression.)For me this is all fascinating but not as involving as I would have liked. I mean, if you compare to the obvious, like a Batman or Spiderman movie, you see a different visual effect in much of it, and it's distinctive and very smart and actually refreshing. But it lacks the propelling plot and the compelling characters, period. For me, as a novice to this world, which I assume many or most viewers can relate to. Still, it's really different, and worth at least a partial look to give it a shot.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

The best comic book movie of all-time?,"There is a certain irony in the idea that a film that seeks to completely and utterly deconstruct the super hero/comic book mythos may in fact be the best film the genre has ever produced.Of course such sentiments are naturally subjective, but when re-visiting 'Watchmen""' for the first time in several years I was constantly struck by its wit and artistic splendor. Qualities that are light years ahead of the more lauded, commercially successful but ultimately soulless and creatively bankrupt MCU.'Watchmen' certainly has its defenders, but generally it's a film that seems to be regarded as ""bad"". Any adaptation is bound to disappoint some of the source material's fans (even Peter Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy had its share of critics) but this sentiment goes beyond the rabid lovers of Alan Moore's groundbreaking graphic novel. People generally seem to dislike this movie and to them I say ""Did we watch the same film?"".I suppose it's possible that 'Watchmen' was simply just ahead of its time, and audiences back in 2009 weren't ready for the genre to be disassembled and re-arranged quite yet. Maybe now that the increasingly banal, fast food films that Marvel/Disney have produced have utterly saturated the market people are now in a better place to truly appreciate this film. I hope that in the coming years it is re-evaluated and retroactively given its just due.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Watchmen: another so - so reality show,"Right up front, the fact is, this movie was just interesting. The story seems to imply that superheroes are just people too. My reaction is ""so? superheroes aren't real."" I can go to any movie knowing that any person is just a person. Am I supposed to be drawn to these superheroes because they are people? Am I supposed to suffer with them because they acted like people? Not every person is the same and not every superhero is the same. So? Can we get to something substantial please? Guess what? We do. We find out that superheroes are like people when things are good AND when things are bad!. Wow. Another lesson in life - redux.The special effects were simply OK. I challenge critics of special effects in other superhero movies to give this a higher grade. Dr Manhattan and his ""fortress"" were cartoonish to a fault and should have been given more attention.While some of the action was enjoyable, it usually felt gratuitous and simply distraction from the slow moving pace. I can say I did not go to this movie for action but some more would have been nice. At one point, I was even imagining Rorschach fighting Batman - that would have been fun.Rorschach(Jackie Earle Haley) and Nite Owl II(Patrick Wilson) were the most interesting characters and yet were both still underused in my opinion. Malin Akerman was enjoyable as Silk Spectre II, well, because I am a person and I have person desires. While Mr Comedy has the most action, I enjoyed the action the other three provided much more.I did enjoy the story somewhat for having a different take on what it can mean to be a superhero and some of the characterizations were noteworthy. For the most part, though, it felt too preachy partly because of the extensive narration. Although, in a weird way, because the narration was done by Rorschach it did lend some sincerity to the story as it is Rorschach who really is the bonding agent in the movie.I know this is a confusing review but the movie itself was somewhat confusing and frustrating because it was only ""just interesting"". It gets 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Worth watching for you?,"NOTE: This is a cut/paste (and slight touch-up) of one of my message board comments. It pretty much addresses my take on a prevalent, hot issue re ""Watchmen""; it it worth watching?Here's my experience: Snyder opens up with the murder of the Comedian. I want to know why; he seems like a strange, rich, complex person. A bit tragic, perhaps? Who is this guy in his penthouse app't, reading Hustler and channel surfing? And why a crack assassin? Oh! Look! A bit heavy-handed, perhaps, and no doubt impaired by encroaching post-middle-age, but he does pack a wallop! And why does the assassin at least afford the Comedian some semblance of a fair fight?; he could have just plugged him in the brain and pocketed the fee. Is it because it's a movie, and people expect action, or is there something else? And then the credits montage rolls; beautiful, colorful, with taunting images that set up the parallel universe in which Silhouette gets the nurse, we get a good look at the dude on the Grassy Knoll (do I know him?(!)), the phalanx of National Guardsmen shoot the DFH's point-blank, and some blue dude is shaking hands with Kennedy.At this point, I'm on the edge of my seat; and I don't mean that literally: The film has given me all the cues I need to get locked in and poised to take in the story from a particular mindset. I'm going to be scouring the screen, looking for visual clues, contextualizing the flashback vignettes, carefully processing the spoken lines to try to understand what makes the characters tick. I know that sounds like a normal response to normal storytelling, but for me I'm talking about one especially engaging kind of movie storytelling.And this is what this kind of movie does to me. Memento (Christopher Nolan flick with Guy Pierce) did this to me, for pretty much the same reasons; on-screen characters are doing things out of the ordinary, for reasons that may be opaque at first, but the film work quickly leads me to believe that if I do my part, if I pay attention and dig hard enough, I'll break the code and understand. And, if I'm really lucky, the flick will not have lead me astray. It pays off in silver dollars.Watchmen does all this for me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
So close yet so distant,"As ambitious as it can be, Zack Snyder's ""Watchmen"" may have faithfully transplanted its source material to the big screen with all due reverence, but the overlong and overstuffed result of an intense fascination for accurate cinematic replication strips the narrative of emotional depth to mitigate the inherent shortcomings bound to constantly recur in the cinematic version of the highly lauded (and supposedly ""unfilmable"") graphic novel by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. Snyder's craftsmanship handsomely portrays the progression of the American society in relation to its captivation of costume-clad superheroes as exemplified by its nostalgia-tripping opening credit sequence, yet this same technical proficiency for highly stylized aesthetic, of which the director has a marked penchant for, never translates into an impelling force.The stilted consequence of Snyder's overwhelming mechanisms, however, largely benefits from a premier source material that functions as a deconstruction of the superhero mythos that, through its elaborate narrative techniques, provocatively reflects on the resolute inclination of mankind to topsy-turviness. In an alternate 1985, the antagonism between the US and USSR is running at an all-time high, and Richard Nixon, serving his fifth term as the US president while basking in his dubious victory in Vietnam, has declared all superhero activities illegal. Now reduced to a vigilante, Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) discovers that the Comedian (James Dean Morgan), a former superhero and colleague, has been murdered, which eventually rejoins him with other former superheroes including Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson), Silk Spectre II (Malin Ackerman) and Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup), as they learn of a binding conspiracy that spells catastrophic results.Snyder's intricate sequence of events is a favorable, albeit patchy, estimate of the graphic novel's multi-parallel narrative structure that upholds dread for the inevitable self-destruction both for its corrupted protagonists and the world at large. Yet despite the almost verbatim adaptation, it's a cinematic abridgment that overall feels lethargic, highlighted to a detrimental effect by a protracted running time that jams as much material as theatrically possible. In part, it's because of its dispassionate characters that, save for Haley's monomaniacal turn as the inkblot-stained mask-wearing Rorschach, never conveys a sense of attachment; and in part, it's because of the sporadic slo-mo-induced action scenes that are less visually dynamic than in the director's previous works. It's ultimately a fanboy-pleasing replica that serves nothing else except perhaps to further provide more groundwork to the argument that the source is better than the adaptation.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"A complex and fascinating movie, not for the easily distracted","'Watchmen' is an excellent and faithful adaptation of the graphic novel with superb acting and a great atmosphere. I actually saw the film without ever reading the book but I enjoyed it so much that I bought the novel soon after and finished it very quickly. Yes, it's dark, it's violent, it's disturbing at times but most movies nowadays are and any schmuck can make a flick with those qualities and little else.No, the reason to see 'Watchmen' is because it's REAL. Yeah I know that glowing blue super-men are not real. Genetically engineered felines are not real. Richard Nixon still being president (and respected at that) in 1985 is certainly NOT REAL. If you can suspend your disbelief in these things and accept that it's a fantasy story in a fantasy version of our past, you'll be astounded at how believable the rest of the movie actually is.The characters act and speak as real people do. They interact with each other like real people. They have normal problems and try to solve them like anyone would. The world around them isn't some utopia with a few bad eggs spoiling it for everyone else like in most comic books. You don't see the local caped crime-fighter show up to save the day. Sure, there are ""heroes"" in costumes fighting the good fight in this movie but most of them are middle-aged has-beens and a couple are more psychotic and dangerous than the bad guys.It appears to me that many people have trouble following a movie that's even slightly more complicated than The '40 Year-Old Virgin'. 'Watchmen' has a lot of back-story and subplots that make it not exactly a linear viewing. Honestly though, if you are paying attention and enjoying yourself, it's not that hard to follow. I was having such a good time that I found any little extra info or secondary plot point made it an even richer experience.If you don't like lengthy, complex, thought-provoking films then 'Watchmen' probably isn't for you. I'm amazed this was directed by the same man that did '300' considering that was such a piece of trash and this is phenomenal. The story is very engaging and the near 3 hour length of this movie flies by. The cinematography is very well done, especially during the opening credits and the backgrounds/environments are really nice. There isn't as much action as I thought there might be but the fight scenes it does have are pretty exciting. Many people claim that the soundtrack was decent but the songs were at inappropriate moments. I think that all the songs fit the scenes quite nicely aside from 'Hallelujah' during the sex scene because all I could picture was the pre-wedding montage from 'Shrek'.All told, it was a great movie based on a great series of comics and I highly recommend it. Some non-spoiler highlights include:1. The opening credits. Nice slow-mo old-timey shots and real historic events/people mixed in and altered.2. Rorschach. The character is just plain awesome and Jackie Earle Haley kills (literally) in the role.3. Dr. Manhatttan's origin narration. One of the most emotional parts of the movie despite or because of Dr. M's completely unfeeling delivery.4. Nite Owl II's hideout. From his suit and night-vision goggles in the display case to Archimedes the Owl Ship, the man's dank basement has some nice gadgets.5. The anti-hero rally. In a flashback sequence, the Comedian jumps down from above and takes out some protesters to the tune of 'I'm Your Boogie Man' from KC & The Sunshine Band.

"A faithful adaptation, which means it misses the point","WATCHMEN is one of the most important texts of the 20th century. As a deconstruction of the concept of the superhero and a sharp analysis of the paranoia of the Cold War, it defines and diagnoses the period in which it was released. It also deftly demonstrates that the comic book can be a serious art form.Zack Snyder gets the majority of the key moments from the comics yet misses almost all of the themes. For one thing, everything looks too perfect, too clean, too rendered by computers. Dave Gibbons' art was deliberately grungy, fitting the dystopian alternate America of the narrative. Night Owl and Silk Spectre come together because they're lonely old heroes -- they're out of shape and struggle to regain both the fire to fight crime and the timing and physical moves they used to know -- but Snyder makes them in-shape ass kickers capable of taking out thugs in an alleyway or murderers in a prison riot. The violence in the original was brutal but also frequently just suggested but Snyder makes sure we see people get their arms cut off or their teeth break.The film is poorly cast, with only Jeffrey Dean Morgan grasping the narcissism that fuels the Comedian's desire to be a hero and his regret over his life and Jackie Earl Haley reaching the unsettled morality of Rorschach. Malin Akerman appears to be reciting her lines phonetically, Matthew Goode is a non-entity as Ozymandias, and Carla Gugino mugging underneath some of the worst aging make-up in cinema history. Bily Crudup is lost beneath mediocre CGI that makes his lips look like rubber bands wavering near where his mouth should be.That said, it moves pretty well and is entertaining enough, I guess, and Morgan's best moments capture exactly what Moore was going for. It's worth watching... but as an adaptation of a comic book miniseries that is a must-read, that's not good enough.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
DC Does It Again,"With this dramatic foray into the grand graphic novel of the same name, DC has done it again.Unlike Marvel, which spews out watered down drivel for the kiddie-crowd, DC remains true to its adult, comic book reading audience.

Dawn of the Hero-Complex,"This film was an experience and a joy to watch.The visuals were breathtaking and unique. It had all the qualities of a massive spectacle.Yet, the visual effects complemented the issues and themes that the film was trying to address such as nuclear proliferation, abuse of power, the human condition and so forth.Furthermore, since this film is based on a comic book, the delivery of some of these themes never felt pretentious. Ironically, since the characters suffering from their existential turmoil are comic book characters, their emotions seemed to resonate stronger given the cynical nature of the story.Many people have said that this film is a deconstruction of the comic book superhero and I agree. If we trace back the genealogy of comic book heroes, quite a few superhero comics have been utilized as propaganda. This film celebrates and shuns the golden age of superheroes and its' consequences.The overt violence, sex, oldie and newbie rock worked as subversive symbolism which helped avoid any superhero movie clichés. It's also refreshing to see comic book heroes behave unpredictably.Ultimately, Watchmen is a lot of things and delivers on many genres.

A Movie Adaptation Worthy of the Comic,"In an alternate world set in 1985, Nixon is still president and the two superpowers are on the brink of nuclear war. The only deterrent, Dr. Manhattan, has turned his back on humanity and fled the planet... pushing the doomsday clock even closer to midnight. Can Manhattan be persuaded to return to Earth, or is this the end of the human race? Watchmen is a brilliant comic and a brilliant movie. It explores politics, ethics, deviant sexuality and still contains a great superhero vibe for those who just like butt-kicking. The graphic novel was a landmark achievement, and after years of handing the script from one person to another, Zack Snyder has emerged as the man capable of putting it together, and impressing us all. Few adaptations do justice to the original, but ""Watchmen"" does an amazing job. As an added bonus, largely unknown actors were cast... not creating a distraction of one character over another when all (or at least most) have their own unique, important tales to tell.The political aspects are numerous -- nuclear war, Soviet versus American aggression, the term limits of presidents, vigilantism and the Keene Act (paralleling the X-Men's ""Days of Future"" storyline). But it is the moral aspect that really tugs at me. ""Let justice be done, though the whole world perish"" is a quote from Immanuel Kant, but it could apply to Rorshach. He is debatably the hero of the story with a strongly defined morality (Kant's consequentionalism) blended with seeming insanity, though he is the only one trying to make the world better one person at a time.A very extreme utilitarianism emerges in one of the characters towards the end -- can we sacrifice the few to save the many? Rorshach would clearly oppose this, but if the outcome is positive, can the action be justified? This poses a difficult problem for the viewer and the characters, because the action is so heinous yet the outcome so bountiful... is it wrong or necessarily right? (I'd be more specific and address this more, but I don't wish to give away the plot.) While ""Spiderman"" and ""X-Men"" get all the attention, it is films like ""Watchmen"" that leave a lasting impression in my mind (""The Spirit"", too). Even ""The Dark Knight"" or ""Batman Begins"", which are incredible, don't have the power to keep the conversation going hours, days and weeks after viewing them. If you were considering seeing ""Watchmen"" but haven't yet, make it a top priority -- this is a film to end all films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Great - and terrible,"Watchmen looks at times like it might be THE comic book adaption, you know, the one which masters the transition from paper to screen without looking just 2-dimensional on second viewing and unwatchable on third viewing.

I am enjoying this ride"" After the second hour I was thinking ""Hey! When did this turn into the Fantastic Four 3?"" (Not a good thing by the way).After the third hour I was thinking ""Wasn't this only meant to be 2.5 hours long?

Big Bore-fest of a Movie,"I love to see movies based off comics, because I know there will be lots of action to keep you watching and entertained. However, this movie decided to screw the audience and bore them to death. It is likely the most boring movie I've ever seen. ""Oh what do you know?

However, a few months back, I found the comics and read them, and I must say, I was quite impressed with them. The movie is very faithful to the comics, in that they both have massive amounts of dialogue. In a comic, that's fine, as we are reading the words to get what's happening. The problem is when you adapt that to film, all that dialogue, with little action in between, will bore your audience. The only good parts of the movie were the action scenes, what few there were.

"Lives up to the end of the decade ""superhero"" movie.","I have seen this movie twice now, and I can't wait to see it again. I have been waiting for this movie to come out for awhile now, and I was not disappointed. I picked up the graphic novel over 3 years ago and have reread it several times sense, falling in love with all its complexity, philosophical musings, tragic characters, and original dialog. I harbored many mixed emotions about a movie being made,initially I was excited, but a few months ago, I started feeling queasy and thought ""what if this sucks, compromises, and totally misses the major points."" I'm glad to say that is not the case. The film is receiving mixed reviews, simply put its not for everyone. While it does cater to the fanboys it is attracting original fans also. Reading the graphic novel does give an advantage to understanding the overall story line, but its not required for the main plot just as long as one pays attention. Some of the naysayers out there don't like it because it is ""too weird"", ""too long"", ""too reverent to the comic"". Others don't like it because they may have been stupid enough to ignore the R rating and took their kids to see what they thought was the live action Incredibles movie. This was a very ambitious project and very challenging. Watchmen had been in development hell for 20 years. Speaking as someone who thought that 300 was ""just good, not great"" I think no one could of done a better job then Snyder. The acting was great also. Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach gave me chills.....he nailed it completely. Best comic book performance ever (or graphic novel whichever you prefer, although nods to Rourke in sin city and Ledger(esp.) for the dark knight). Patrick Wilson was very convincing as conflicted nice guy Dan........who missed his days as Nightowl. Billy Crudup was just wow as Dr. Manhatten....being detached from the rest of humanity while pitying them from afar. Morgan was also a great dirtbag but oh so cool sadistic/yet repentant Comedian. His performance was mesmerizing,esp. after the nice guy rows he has had. Matthew Goode did better as Ozy then I expected........as he did channel the gray areas of his character and his utilitarian philosophy.I am not going to tell you the ending, but this may be a minor spoiler.The ending was pretty faithful to the graphic novel but different. The conclusion was the same, but the means to that conclusion were different. And the plan was a little more global then just New York also. This ending made more sense for the movie as the original would of required a whole lot of screen time to pull it off. I was upset would I figured out before that the ending was altered at all. I even figured it out, but upon seeing the movie i was satisfied and proud. The ending may seem slightly more optimistic in the film, it did not compromise the effect or conform to typical American blockbuster endings.....",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Who Watches the Watchmen? You Should,"OK we have been waiting for this one for a long time and sometimes you have to remember that it could have been done by Michael Bay and truly F@#*ed up.With that in mind The Watchmen stayed loyal to the fans of the comic. I have been reading that critics are saying it is too loyal the the graphic novel to which I say F@*& that. I personally don't want to watch a Constantine like version of such an awesome graphic novel. I actually thought it was awesome to watch the movie and have shots right from the comic on the big screen. It was fun to point them out to the person next to me. The pace of the movie for me was great you were never saying get on with it or having battle fatigue.Sorry No Squid but really I actually liked this ending a bit more and it seemed to make a bit more sense. The world would have to unite to fight a man that can be everywhere at once.I thought that the characters were extremely well done. The Nite Owl is a personal favorite and Patrick Wilson did an awesome job as did Eral Harley in the role of Rorschach. I did not have one complaint in the characters recreation.And any comic interpretation that my mom loves is OK with me. Just remember its 2 hours and 45 minutes, pee three times before you go in and no liquids for three hours prior. The time really flys by. Remember though it is a movie and try and enjoy it.

Wow! As epic as they come.,This is my first time writing an IMDb review but after seeing Watchmen I thought it was important to tell people how brilliant this film actually is. It is breathtaking and I have to say a masterpiece. Maybe I'm reading too much into what I saw because I have not read the graphic novel myself. But honest to God I don't know what more any of you fanboys could possibly want. I have not (since Lord of the Rings) seen a director pay such painstaking detail and attention to a movie. The music was cleverly chosen and the characters were all brilliant. Jackie Earle Haley was superb as the tormented Rorschach as was Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian. Billy Crudup's Dr Manhattan added a still peacefulness to the film and was able to inspire the awe of a god. I did not find it confusing but compelling and challenging. Moviegoers are too lazy today. I have watched many a flick were the plot is recapped over and over again.

A Masterpiece of the comic book genre,"First off, I have not read the comic book, I was not sucked into the hype, simply because I thought the trailer made the film look so CGI packed and ridiculous. Saying that, maybe that is why I loved it. Just a year after the fan and critically acclaimed The Dark Knight, which really took the superhero and comic book genre to another level, Watchmen achieves great heights as well. It is another Masterpiece of this genre, and to me, it was pretty much perfect. It is not the realistic, gritty drama that The Dark Knight was, and for that reason some will not take it seriously, but I really thought it was just an amazing film. The acting was great, as was the writing I thought. It really should not be compared to Zack Snyder's other films. It puts 300 to shame. The visual style is just as great and surreal as any other epic, and the visual effects are outstanding, flashy, but not too realistic, which is the only way that it could have worked. I find it sad how many critics have dismissed it for being too long, and too much of a mess and dull. I can see why they said that, because this film is sure to dismiss a lot of people off. But I thought it was genius, and this is certainly the best superhero film ever made, next to The Dark Knight.10/10 Seriously, go watch it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Great film!,"I'm a critique of depressing drama by trade... As a child I was fascinated by even the mediocre horror and Sci-fi. Science Fiction filmography has very an infrequent base of release that can be categorized in the top shelf of movie goers ""award winning"" regime. It's often unfair that we exclude such extraordinary film work of various types from Oscar ""best film"" and associated applause. Especially in more recent years, this genre of film has seen tremendous effort and excellence. Anyway... to be blunt,... this film is landmark. To consider how difficult it would be to follow such a great graphic novel is certainly mind-boggling. The DVD graphic novel rendition is very good, and even though the narration lacks differentiation between character narration or gender it is very good. Hence, a hard act to follow. The movie adaptation is eerie and you catch things verbatim from the illustrated version of caption bubbles. Even certain background items leap from cartoon to film, it's SO damned good. Unfortunately for those people hell bent on absolute rendition of graphic novel to movie adaptation they might be disappointed. There are slights to the story to make the movie adaptation more pleasing, believable, etc,... Certainly the cartoon of a grotesque alien is difficult to adapt so the film does a certain makeover to the plot and does it exceptionally well IMHO. This film will stand the test of time. In the ranks of other Sci_Fi films like Bladerunner, Forbidden Planet, The Day the Earth Stood Still, 2001 A Space Odyssey, etc,... This film distorts the time table and allows the viewer to molt with a wide range of futuristic yet retrospective mind bend. In as much as I wanted to criticize, characters in this movie like Rorschach are simply so incredible and well acted that it would leave you breathless. As the statement goes... ""I'm not in here with you,... you're in here with me!""... And so the story goes. Highly recommended.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"A visual spectacle for those who have read the graphic novel, a great story for everyone else","I learnt about Watchmen when I was in my first year at college. One of my friends had recently received the graphic novel as a present and he would often bring it. I was curious to know what the graphic novel was about, so I looked it up, and that's how I discovered this movie. I wasn't much into superhero genre before this, so I decided to take a look at it. Back then I thought this was a great story, and after having read the original graphic novel, I think it's a great adaptation.In the opening scenes the Minutemen are summarised with the song ""For the times they are a-changin'"" playing in the background. It was so cool to watch. It doesn't matter whether you like Zack Snyder's movies or not. One thing you do have to admit is that his opening scenes are always awesome. And this one is the one that absolutely nails it.The costumes have been made either very faithful to the comic book counterparts like those of Silk Spectre II and The Comedian, or have been improvised as in the case of Ozymandias and Night Owl II. Dr Manhattan's ""thing"" is surely a bit distracting, but I was able to ignore it after a while. Rorschach was my favourite character in this movie. The one criticism this movie gets is that he was portrayed to be a badass dude instead of a self centred hypocrite that he was in the graphic novel, and I completely understand this. But I also like this interpretation. Since most of the story is centred over Rorschach figuring out about The Comedian's death, he has to look as interesting as possible in order to keep the audience engaged.Another criticism this movie often gets is that it was unable to capture the visual essense of the graphic novel, which I completely disagree with. The graphic novel has an 80's styled drawing. Why would you want this movie to be made with that style? It is a good thing that this movie didn't go for the same visual style. This criticism is the equivalent of ""why Wolverine doesn't wear his comic book costume in the movies"". Dude things have to be changed in order to be adapted on the big screen. It's also the reason why the giant squid was replaced with a nuclear bomb. A giant squid sounds very funny instead of serious. No country would take any big action in case that happens.If you're watching this movie for the first time, I'd say you should try the Director's Cut first. If you have no problem with the length of the movie and you can see and understand everything that you see in complicated movies, I'd say you should go with the Ultimate Cut. I watched the Ultimate Cut. Initially I was bored because of how the story was dragging on, but slowly everything started to make sense. I really like all the action scenes in this movie, and often go back to watching it just for the old time's sake.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
He did it guys,"So before anyone possibly jumps down my throat for giving this a positive review, just know that I haven't read the comics. I've heard many times that this film somehow doesn't understand the source material, and honestly I wouldn't be surprised seeing as it is coming from Zack ""Martha"" Snyder, but I'm not familiar with the original work, so I can't comment on it.So having said that, I enjoyed this quite a bit. Even having not read the book though, it's certainly not flawless. The version I watched was the Ultimate Cut, which for some reason decided to waste an entire half an hour on animation sequences spread throughout the film telling the story of an in-universe comic book for seemingly no reason other than to draw parallels between it and the rest of the narrative, and this could have probably been done in a minute's worth of dialogue if they absolutely had to make this seem deeper than it is.Other than that, I didn't think Malin Akerman was all that good in this, although that's likely just because the entire rest of the cast acts circles around her, it can occasionally feel a bit up its own butt, especially when the Snyder who directed Man Of Steel comes out to play for a bit, some of the dialogue is unbearably cringey, and at least for the three and a half hour version I watched, the pacing does suffer in a few places.All that said, of all the Snyder films I've talked about on here, this is heads and shoulders above any of the rest of them, because it feels like it was directed by an actual adult who had a talent for directing actors and conceiving interesting shots, which I really can't say about any of those other trainwrecks. All the performances are great even if there is an obvious weak link, there's some really nice and memorable images throughout, the characters are an interesting and fresh spin on superhero stories, and I really liked the story even if it could have been paced better.It's an odd mix of The Incredibles, Dr. Strangelove and Sin City, a mix that I'm sure has you shaking your head in confusion right now, because how could that ever work? It sounds weird for sure, but for me at least, it does work. Really bloody well.As for how much of it working is down to Zack Snyder and how much is down to Alan Moore...well, I'm at least now sure that at one point, Zack did have some talent in him, but I feel like this has to be a Game Of Thrones situation, where if he didn't have such great material already written for him, this probably would have been another crash and burn.And I actually really want to read that material now, so please don't scream at me if you're a comic purist who despises this movie, because I likely wouldn't have for quite a while if I hadn't seen this.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
One word:  Spectacular !!,"On my second viewing this movie is as good or better than the first. I urge anyone who is on the fence over seeing it and waiting for the DVD, you are making a big mistake. There is no way the spectacular visuals will impress with equal impact on a TV screen.I went with friends who hadn't seen it yet, and judging by their positive but mildly befuddled reactions, I feel that foreknowledge of the source material is essential. Even though the film's storytelling is solid, the dense plot, time shifts and abundance of characters is a lot of information to process. Get through as much of the comic book (now sold as a graphic novel) as you can, while WATCHMEN is still in theaters. You'll be glad you did.Those unfamiliar with the story seem to think the film goes on forever. Not so for us who do: the trip to Antarctica signals the final act. You'll also know why Ozymandias has a purple tiger as a pet (one of his companies oversees genetic experimentation, not explained in the film.) You'll also enjoy some of the other details that couldn't be included.The critics who don't understand what this movie is about should blame themselves and not the filmmakers. Hopefully they found a better experience seeing PAUL BLART:MALL COP.Grade: A+.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Too much material for one film,"Watchmen opened in Switzerland today and I caught one of the first screenings in Geneva.It was a disappointment.Those who've read the book will find it a shallow reflection of the original graphic novel. Some scenes are taken almost panel for panel from the book and a number of these are done very well. But the fundamental problem remains that even with over two hours running time there simply isn't enough time to explore the depth of the book. Major themes are heavily modified or completely absent, and equally often short cuts are taken. Much of the moral interest is lost and relations between the characters are hastily compressed into two or three lines of dialogue.The same hasty treatment of the themes and characters are likely to confuse those who haven't read the book. Time and location changes quickly, both forward and backward, but with little clue to the viewer as to what is happening. We're given no reason to care about the characters, and the plot is tediously slow until it is suddenly explained in exposition at the end.It evoked a couple of short laughs but for most of the film the audience was silent. As soon as the film finished everyone headed straight for the exit. Not a good sign.Maybe a new, longer cut will repair some of the glaring flaws in this release. Until then, you'll have more fun reading the book.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

The most faithful comic book adaptation I have ever seen.,"Before watching this film, I read the 12-chapter graphic novel ""Watchmen"". I loved it and decided to watch the Ultimate Cut of the film.This cut included absolutely EVERYTHING from the novel, including the ""Tales of The Black Freighter"" story.Let's start from the very start of the film. The Comedian's death was perfectly filmed, and it followed with an even better opening credits sequence.Then, we have the introduction of perhaps the greatest comic book character of all time: Rorschach. Next, we are introduced to Dan Dreiberg/Nite-Owl and Silk Spectre. Then, we have the most tragic character, Dr. Manhattan. Finally, we are introduced to Adrian Veidt, the main villain.I won't drop any spoilers, but from there, each scene is adapted from the graphic novel shot-for-shot. That's how faithful it is to the source material. All I have to say is Kudos to Zack Snyder for adapting a masterful graphic novel into an even bigger masterpiece of a movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
The comic book geek blockbuster for adults only.,"Watchmen is directed by Zack Snyder and adapted to screenplay by David Hayter and Alex Tse from the Alan Moore/David Gibbons graphic novel. It stars Patrick Wilson, Malin Ackerman, Billy Crudup, Jackie Earle Haley, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Carla Gugino and Matt Frewer. Music is by Tyler Bates and cinematography by Larry Fong.1985 and someone is killing all our superheroes. Time for the remaining super heroes to band together - but what they find as they fight the good fight is potential annihilation for everyone.It was quite a battle getting Watchmen onto the screen, over twenty years of legal wrangling and controversies, it got to the point where fans of the source material doubted it would ever happen - and even if it did it was sure to be a monstrous failure. How pleasing to find that not only did it make it to the screen, but it is also a genre bending winner - well to some of us of course...One has to take into context just how potent and original the graphic novel was back in 1986/7, we are dealing with very mature themes, superheroes with serious psychological baggage. Alan Moore lit the touch paper in the comic book kingdom that the rest have since followed to keep the torch burning well into the new millennium. Snyder has achieved top line results in getting both the feel and look of the source, even if some of Moore's cunning cynicism has been lost in translation.Story is set right in the middle of nuclear paranoia and the fear of the Soviets in 85, the America we view is dank and depressing, noirish in vibe (aided by Rorschach's clobber and detective inclinations), it's a world on the road to nowhere. We are also at a time in the alternate world where superheroes are banned from operating, forcing The Watchmen to become vigilantes - that is if they can get along and shunt their psycho discord to one side. The back stories of the main protagonists are fully formed, and these are not jolly characters, so much so you worry the fate of mankind is doomed if these are who we rely on to save us.There was in no way that Snyder would be able to produce a comic book filmic adaptation that would be as worshipped in that sphere, to rival that of the worship the novel has in its own. However, coming at it as someone who only sought out the source material after seeing the film, it shines bright for newcomers who are ironically seeking darker tints in superhero tales. Oh it has the requisite nifty twists (a clinical mystery to be unearthed), booming visuals, excellent effects work and smartly constructed action set-pieces, but narratively it's moody and calls for the utmost attention on dialogue passages (I have found it gets better on repeat viewings).Snyder clearly cared about the project and that love is evident in the movie. It was never going to appease all and sundry, but at worst to hardcore Moore fans it's at least an honourable failure, to many others it's a smart and stylishly refreshing genre booster. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
At least one good book-to-movie,"There have been many book to movie adaptations, from mistakes like Eragon to masterpieces like Lord of the Rings, but I think ""Watchmen"" has my vote for the film that is the most loyal to its novel counterpart. Snyder's attention to miniscule things in the book like clothing of background characters and translating the ragged word bubbles of Rorschach into a ragged voice for the film character made this film the best interpretation of the novel that you're ever going to see. Exact quotes were pulled from the book and lighting and camera angles were expertly reproduced into the high-quality film. When it comes to taking this graphic novel and putting it through Hollywood, Zack Snyder was the perfect man for the job.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Meh it would have been better to leave Alan Moore on the cutting room floor.,"I never liked the comic. I've always thought it was way overrated. It has some premises that are interesting and seemed innovating in 1985. But I have always thought the characters were ""over the top"" poor imitations of cliché super heroes. That's why I never dug it. With this film adaption I had hoped that they would ""hollywoodize"" it a bit and make it better. In some ways they did, all the characters in it are superior to the comic's versions, including Dr. M's wang. The film in many ways was near frame to panel with the comic. There were a few subplots dropped, like the newsstand thing, the cops chasing Rorshach just two steps behind, and the giant alien monster! However all those losses did nothing to hurt the film and honestly helped it in my opinion. I mean the new ending is actually superior to the comics ending and probably will save the film for audiences that are unfamiliar with Alan Moore's work. But the film is too close to the comic still, it frames like the comic, too tight, and follows the original plot too close which in all honesty is boring and a has long drawn out moments where it just fizzles.The first fifteen minutes of history lessons that introduces audiences to Alan Moore's twisted world. Part of me says you could probably walk out after this and be satisfied with the price of the movie. It really is that good! Finally, and this was unexpected, but really the reason I just don't hate the movie, Night Owl... I hated this character in the comic and often times skipped over scenes with him in it... which easy to do since his relevance in the comic seems only a cliché marker to the batman like character of comics. But in this movie the actor brings him to life. I mean he shines in this. With all the fizzle points in the film I often found myself longing for the film to return to his plot. To be completely honest the movie would have been great if it has just been a Night Owl film.What I didn't like was the sex scene in Archie (Night Owl's Airship), ugh it was a horrible awkward uncomfortable moment that was drawn out and made me and the people around me want to walk out. Sadly earlier in the film the two characters have a similar scene where they are suppose to be awkward and I found that scene cute romantic and original. Over all though the sex scenes in the film were nothing more to me than poor superhero porn. (and for god sakes that song was awful it was like they were just trying to make me hate sex.)I HATED Dr. M in the Comic and I hate him in the movie. Period, game over. I know he is needed in order to make sense of the final plot, but I wish they would have given him less scenes and cut him back. I dreaded every scene where his blue began to shine. The actor was fine, Dr. M just annoys me to no end.In the end, if Zack Snyder hadn't tried so hard to please Alan Moore this would have been a better movie. I honestly think Alan Moore should realize that Film is another medium for his character to live in. He should respect that film makers take him and his characters seriously and that Snyder made a masterpiece version of Moore's graphic novel that by all rights would have been better if he had left more of Alan's work on the cutting room floor.Alan Moore should buck up, go see it, because it is eye candy, accept that it is a movie, walk over to Zack Snyder, thank him for bringing his characters to life for so many people who will fall in love with this movie (and hate my review). Then thank the guy who played Night Owl II... It is rare and unique to see a character made better by an actor and Patrick Wilson does just that. It left me wanting more Night Owl and Spectre.Yes I will go see this movie again Monday and I will buy it when it comes out on DVD. Because for all that fizzles in this film, Patrick Wilson, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Jackie Earle Haley, Malin Akerman and Zack Snyder make it Shine! Special note to Alan Moore and his loyalist: SHUT UP! You people are so lucky to see your characters brought to life with so much respect. Countless writers and their fans would kill to have people take their work as seriously as Zack Snyder took Moore's. Go pay some respect, because they have paid you all plenty with this film. And in many ways hurt their own craft trying to make you happy.Note to Alan Moore and his loyalist: SHUT UP! You people are so lucky to see your characters brought to life with so much respect.

Best super hero film yet,"I just watched this for the first time, with no previous knowledge of the Watchmen, and was amazed.From the opening scene you know this is not your normal super hero film.Mainly by the violence, there's lots of it and its very graphic....awesome. Don't be put off by the costumes, they do look stupid but soon feel right. I waited for the directors cut to watch this, on blu ray, after being told its good.And i was rewarded with 3hrs of brilliant film making.The writing, directing and effects, all were great, faultless.The story was really good, and left me hungry for a sequel.I never heard of the watchmen before this film, now im searching for the source. The characters and the world depicted, are so well done, and so real.Never have super hero's been written this way.Each character is opened up and laid bare for the viewer, and you get so attached.Even the not so nice Comedian (brilliantly acted by Jeffrey Dean Morgan) pulls the old heart strings.I cannot comment on how it relates to the anime or graphic novel, but you get the feeling watchmen fans are more than happy.This is the kind of hero story I've always wished for, spiderman and the xmen are always way too politically correct for me.Where as watchmen is definitely not for kids.My hats off to Snyder, and to Alan Moore, Dave gibbons and John Higgins.Im off to explore a DC comics store, and see what other brilliant stuff they been hiding.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"A new family member of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Blade Runner"" and ""The Matrix""","This is an attempt at writing a review for ""Watchmen"". I can only try to give a comprehensive summary of my thoughts, as it's incredibly difficult to get a grip on this unusual movie.There I said it: The movie is unusual. Very. That in itself is a good thing. After ""300"" director Zach Snyder delivers yet another visually stunning motion picture. This man seems to be destined to make eye-candy comic book adaptations for the big screen. What surprises me is the fact that ""Watchmen"" did so well at the box office. I would have thought that this lengthy, highly philosophical piece isn't made for mainstream audiences. Well, I was wrong.So Snyder succeeded commercially but is ""Watchmen"" also an artistic triumph? I haven't made up my mind, yet. Having not read the original graphic novel, I can only judge the movie by itself. As I've said, the visuals are definitely something to remember (except for a few mediocre CGI shots of Dr. Manhattan and the glass building that comes out of the ground on Mars) and the movie is unlike anything I've ever seen.Just being different doesn't make for a masterpiece, though. And as much as the movie intrigued me, it was also hard to sit through at times. The pacing is just so damn slow and it's hard to figure out what's going on for the most part. The weird mixture of different time periods, leaves you scratching your head. What are the makers trying to say with all that symbolism? Most of the time you feel like when you first watched that scene in ""Matrix: Reloaded"" where Neo meets The Architect, wondering whether you're too stupid to understand the meaning of it all, or if it's all much ado about nothing.Personally, I'm partial to the latter option. For all artistic value, I still want a movie to be entertaining or gripping. ""Watchmen"" was neither, but maybe a second and third viewing could change my mind.In the end this movie could either become your new bible or it could disgust you for all its pretentious loftiness. In that aspect ""Watchmen"" is very similar to cult movies such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Blade Runner"" and ""The Matrix"". If you liked any of the above, then go see this one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
How can this get a good rating?,"I really don't understand how people could really enjoy this show. It almost seems like this rating is being padded.First the good: The effects are cool - but nothing really new. The only character that is enjoyable is Rorschach. (His one line in prison was great! - ""You guys don't understand. I am not stuck in here with you, you guys are stuck in here with me."") But one line doesn't redeem a movie.The bad: The story line is confusing and moves all over the place - almost like the editor picked up the pieces off the floor in a semi-random fashion. Flashbacks without any reason. The plot is thin. We never really care about any of the characters. The gore is just for shock value. The guy with the ""blue penis"" is boring - his character is flat and sterile. There are sex scenes that last way too long - almost a soft porn movie.Basically - the rating of this is currently 8.1 - Lord of the Rings got a 8.7. If you really think this boring and crappy movie is in the same league as that fantastic movie - then please go see it. Then also take time to view Plan 9 from Outer Space. You will enjoy that too.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Ahead of its time,Had this movie came out 5 years later the superhero movie landscape would be very different. This movie is an interesting adaptation but it still deconstructs the genre the same way the source material does. Only now are we getting more genre decorations such as The Boys and Brightburn. Zach Snyder's best work. Fantastic Cast and brilliant cinematography.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Before the MCU there was Watchmen,"OK, OK, the MCU technically started before Watchmen was released, it just wasn't omnipresent and all powerful as it is now. We have to remember that this was also a time before Zack Snyder had disgraced himself in the eyes of fanboys all over the world.I'll readily admit I hadn't read the comic book when I first saw this film, though I have read it since, which hasn't dulled my love for this film at all.I remember sitting down in the cinema and watching the opening fight scene, which intrigued me. Then the montage playing along with Bob Dylan's ""The Times They are a Changin'"" made me realise I was in for a truly memorable experience.To me Watchmen is what a great super hero movie should be about. Whether the hero has super powers or not it's about the tough decisions, sticking it out when things get messy, and doing the right thing even when you're really not sure what the right thing is. Rorschach's poignant phrase ""Never compromise, even in the face of Armageddon"", is undoubtedly powerful, yet ultimately misguided.The world needs big, fun popcorn superhero flicks like the MCU brings us, along with their own brand of humour. I just wish we could have more films like Watchmen in our lives too.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Excellent,"I liked it a lot. Different from all the other movies. The only reason I can think Alan Moore did not put his name to the movie is because Alan Moore writes comics not film scripts and Alan Moore is fairly string in that conviction.People who say the comic is better are kind of getting Alan Moores point. The graphic novel will always be better. In many ways the main central character to an Alan Moore comic is Alan Moore... kind of like how PK Dick is the central character of a PK Dick novel.The film looks stunning... I mean stunning. The opening sequence is unreal. In the comic there are little sections of 3 or so pages of text... giving background or breadth to the story. The sequence at the stand and various points throughout are like that.Some things I didn't like. I thought it was too short. I had no idea how long it was before or after I got to the cinema. Time stopped while I was watching it. I would like to see an extended directors cut come out on DVD. I understand it was already long enough for cinema but it wouldn't matter at home. The pacing in parts could do with being given a little more time.The ending which I will not speak of deviates from the comic. It makes more sense that the comic but I am not sure if that is a good thing or not. Possibly if there was an extended DVD version we could have the option of both endings.Loved the film, loved the comic, loved the way it looked, the way it felt. Wished it was longer... that my only real complaint.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
An exhausting movie but fascinating,"This is an adaptation of Alan Moore's great graphic novel. It takes place in an alternate universe in the 1980s when Richard Nixon is still president. Super hero groups have been outlawed by the president. The former Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is savagely killed. Another hero named Rorschah (Jackie Earle Haley) investigates and notices former super heroes AND villains are being killed. Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson) and Silk Spectre II (Malin Ackerman) also know something is up. And the blue (and frequently nude) Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) sees something apocalyptic approaching...If you haven't read the novel you might have a problem with this. There's WAY too much happening in the book to cram into one movie so this moves through characters and situations at light speed. Some subplots are dropped completely and the depressing tone of the book is lightened. There's also some pretty funny lines added to lighten things up. My favorites came when the main villain says, ""I'm not some comic book super villain"" and someone says (when it's mentioned Ronald Reagan might be running for president), ""Nobody wants a cowboy as a president"". Even with the changes this might confuse people who haven't read the book. I've read it multiple times so I wasn't confused. I went with a friend who never read it and she wasn't confused either! I guess it just depends on the person.The movie is 165 minutes--it's long but I was never bored. The visuals are impressive and the special effects are just great. I was exhausted and depressed by the end of the movie but I love it. It's that rarity--an adult film not dumbed down for teenagers. Yes, it involves super heroes in silly costumes (Nite Owl II in particular) but the fights aren't fun. They're violent, VERY bloody and brutal...especially when the Comedian gets involved. He enjoys the violence and the film shows him going full blast. There's also a rape scene which is actually more upsetting than the bloody battles! The only fight sequence that wasn't too bloody or upsetting was when Nite Owl II and Silk Spectre II invade a prison and basically knock down about 30 or 40 prisoners in a few minutes! Fights aside this is also a mystery about what's going on and why. It's well-done and keeps you guessing till the end. Then there's nudity--there's plenty of nude full-frontal shots of Dr. Manhattan. But seriously--what's the problem? It's a penis. So what? Every guy has one! Supposedly this has upset people but the movie IS R rated and it fits the character. When I saw it my audience was dead quiet. Nobody seemed bothered or unnerved by it. If you're so prudish that a nude guy bothers you then perhaps you shouldn't see the movie. Great soundtrack too.The acting is excellent. Morgan has the hardest role but he pulls it off. Wilson and Ackerman are sympathetic and nice without becoming TOO syrupy. As for Crudup I can't say how good he is. It's his voice but Manhattan is all CGI. All I'll say is that his voice matches the character. Haley is good too but his voice was way too caustic for the character. Carla Gugino also shines in a supporting role. Only Matthew Goode (as Ozymandies) disappoints. He seems to be holding back for some reason...but he's not in the movie much.So a very violent, long and adult super hero movie. It's not for everybody but I was fascinated. A 10 all the way.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"The last 30 minutes are quite fascinating, after a 2 hour sleepiness","Zach Snyder. Well, I really love the scenes that depict this director's personal point of view. Sometimes the slow motions are exaggerated and highly metaphorical. But of course, too much of anything is not good. The slow motion scenes happen too much which sometimes makes me feel quite annoying.The way the superhero characters appear is also quite blurred and less impressive. Dr. Manhattan seems quite special and attention-grabbing but presents itself as just a guy who has an emotional problem with his girlfriend and babbles about confusing theories. The other characters are also boring, if there is one character that impresses me it is Rorschach, his past is clearly described, so is his personality. Even the villain Veidt is unattractive. Though his plan makes the story interesting.The sensitive scenes in the film are used quite ungratefully, with no effect other than some nude scenes. But the fight scenes, combat and visual effects are beautiful, especially the gore scenes. I would like to commend the martial arts staging team and gore effects. The music in the movie also didn't impress me, when there was a need for tension, the funny music turned on.The plot of the movie is inspired by the comics, so I can't say much about this part, but the movie is quite slow and confusing, until the part when Rorschach and Nite Owl reach the North Pole of Veidt's base, then at that point to the end, it's really good. I really like the theme of the movie, I mean the idea of a good character turning into a bad guy and he wins because no one can deny his results. Veidt won, on all counts. Rorschach gave his life for his cause. Hard to find a more interesting ending. This ending also makes us think about the good and the bad. I understand the director's idea of incorporating an animated story about a pirate who lost his mind. However, these two stories don't make the movie better. The pirate story makes the movie too confusing and difficult to enjoy. Although I understand the director's message very well.And even the part where Rorschach talks about his diary himself, what do we remember about this detail? For that diary to eventually reach a newspaper? Ok so the whole world will be able to know the truth? Oh no because Rorschach didn't have time to bring a pen and paper to the arctic expedition lol.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
An Amazing Experience,"Normally I go to a film expecting to find good things in it- The last film I went to the Theatre to see, last year's remake of ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" - was a disappointment: But my disappointment in that film was mired in my love for Robert Wise' original film from the 50s.This film had no such barriers for me, it was a fresh story, a new look, and quite a different experience than what I was expecting, compared to the last 9 years of Superhero moovies: X-Men, Spiderman, Batman, Superman, Iron Man, Punisher, Spawn, Daredevil, now I love these stories, but you can take all of those I mentioned (And more) and put them to one side, and WATCHMEN stands alone in stark reality, on the other side far removed from those basic superhero stories.I have copies of Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead and 300 and as I enjoyed those films, these are not great films: but WATCHMEN is great like Lord of The Rings is great: Great in Scope, Great in Effort of film-making and storytelling, and Great in Cinematography.And Great in Story: We are told this story through the eyes of Rorschact: We are given a romp through alternate history and we get to see The Kennedy Assassination footage revisualised, the Kent State Massacre atrocity, and the history of the ""Minutemen"" super hero group and the murders of former members- And how fits with what we remember of our own sad history of the last 100 years: WWII, The Cold War, The Vietnam War: The 40's - The 50's - The 60's 70's and this story is told up to 1985 and as a historical representation, this story is accurately told in Music and Images.And so this is the result of The WATCHMEN Graphic Novel as told by Alan Moore, creator of Marvel's ""Xcalibur"" and ""Captain Britain"" and the author of the ""Inferno"" crossover storyline from Marvel Comics back in the late 80's - Early 90s. Moore despises film versions of his work and his aversion to this almost caused this film to not be made. I've seen other films based on his work: Constantine, V for Vendetta, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. This was the best use of his work but of course he sued to try to stop it being made: This makes my respect level of him go to zero. But that does not stop a well told story from being well told, even if told by a guy acting like a jackass instead of working with the creative teams of these films: League could have been Extraordinarily better if he had been involved, V for Vendetta was fantastic, but he sued to have his name taken off the credits.This is not a story for comic books to be sold to kids at the newsstand, this is an adult story like Marvels ""Marvels"" and DC's ""Kingdom Come"" both painted by Alex Ross - As a matter of fact, and at this time I do not know who painted the WATCHMEN Graphic Novel, but this film looks like an Alex Ross painted graphic novel so I would not be surprised to find if Ross did the art.The choice of actors to play Watchmen and also represent figures from our history was well done, Frank Novak makes us believe he is Henry Kissinger and Robert Wisden makes a Nixon rivaling Frost/Nixon's Frank Lanegella.But the centerpiece is Jack Earle Haley (Sugarboy from ""All the Kings Men"") - As he narrates this story and compared to Hugh Jackman's Wolverine - I hate to admit that Haley's Rorschact is a better Wolverine than Jackman! (He is even short, compared to Jackman's immense height).There are a few that stand out, a breakaway performance by Malin Ackerman as Silk Spectre II - And I was in the theatre for the few scenes with Appollonia Vanova as Silhouette: And her appearance caused quite a few wolf-whistles and guffaws, even as a lesbian super heroine.The use of Non-Familiars as the principles... The murky graphic-novel colouring of the film using dark pastels... Made this film visually the best film I have absolutely ever seen.This film is a Film Noire Mystery at it's heart... A Whodunit, with the most complex and convoluted plot I have ever had the pleasure of trying to figure out - There is a lot of misdirection here, and I was surprised to be surprised.I have not enjoyed a film as much since I saw The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy- This story if complete, I hope they do no sequels, I just do not know what direction they could take, Alan Moore outdid himself with this, and I hope he appreciates his own work.San Diego 3/17/2009Addendum 4/3/2009After reading the Watchmen graphic novel and the warner brothers ""motion comic"" - I can say that Zak Snyder paid meticulous attention to detail and every panel from the comic is represented.I now see what was changed, and in the long run, the story survives, and is basically the same story. The part that is missing is the part related to the mini-comic ""Tales of the Black Frieghter"" which ties in to the part that was changed.I stand by my review... And after reading the comic, it was like revisiting the film, every shot is from the book, every look, every costume, every vomit-strewn alley is perfected in this Vision.Much Kudos to Zak Snyder for this immense effort.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"A Serious, Stunning and Complex Film","Watchmen is an adaptation of the renowned comic book series by Alan Moore, Dave Gibbons and John Higgins. Besides being a stunning film it is a fine advertisement to the depth, sophistication and maturity of quality comics.The film justly decided upon a long length film of 2 hours and 43 minutes and an R rating; both facilitate the quality of the production. The themes of the movie include human nature, love, justice, power and, of course, good and evil. A galaxy of rich superhero content from the esteemed comics comprise the plot, as they confront an altered late 20th century history which is near human annihilation. Watchmen manages to portray depth in its characters via narrative which follows individuals whilst also following their complex relations. They are not 'do-gooders', but understandable humans with a spectrum of emotions and thoughts.Complementary camera and editing effects also help the tempo of the film; this movie wasn't rushed. Action throughout the film is well proportioned, with the violent and fighting scenes being enjoyable. Some violence is severe yet it aids the story and doesn't feel superfluous. There are also a few intimate sex scenes that cohere with the experience of Watchmen with none feeling like cheap pandering.Overall, I found Watchmen to be a very satisfying experience and feel the movie comes together as a success. I expect it's integrity will stand out and not waver in time to come.p.s. I am not a comics connoisseur and this review is not a comparison between the comics and movie. Though after watching this film I intend to checkout a few comics.Hot_Ice",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Visually Stunning - but also ponderous, plodding and dull","I can't remember the last time I watched such a thoroughly stunning visual treat on a big screen. I think this is possibly the most authentic realisation of a graphic novel I've seen. Each scene is framed like a panel in a comic, and the viewer is allowed ample time to drink in the superb visual construction of the piece.Sadly, the time this takes makes for a movie far too long, with not enough actually happening, to be enjoyed. The main plot line is fairly thin, and is stretched to the point that I actually forgot about it half way through. The dialogue (Rorschach aside)lacks sparkle, as do the performances (again Rorschach aside - Jackie Earle Haley is to be commended for his performance), whilst the extensive flashbacks used throughout only serve to disrupt the narrative flow and make for an often confusing viewing experience. There's enough here to make me want to revisit the book, but I doubt it will make it to the DVD collection. It's a shame, because I really wanted to like this - but unfortunately I was so bored by the end of it that I just wanted to leave. How disappointing.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
An amazing and stunning story,"Many people commented that to understand the movie you have to read the book first. So I bought Watchmen, and read it in 5 days. And what can I say... It was the best story I've ever read. Period. Then I became obsessive over the movie and I kept begging my poor father to take me to the theater since I am underage. Not going into details, I saw the movie. And I have to say, that Zak Snyder adapted the comic beautifully into film. Unlike his last film, ""300"", Watchmen has great acting and excellent atmosphere. Rorschach will always be the most bad-ass and kick-ass hero of all time. The ending... While the ending was changed a bit in the movie, the ending in the novel paralyzed me. It was an ending that I never heard of. So if you love the novel, or you just love this dark setting of New York with all these bad-ass vigilantes, then... I'm sure your thoughts won't be that much different than mine.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Very good.,"Superhero fans are not a united front. We all have different tastes of what we like in superhero movies. Some of us want a lot of action and a half hour battle at the end, some just want the scenes and the characters to look cool, some want a solid story. Because of this, it's not too much of a surprise to find such different in opinions about this film where paying attention to the plot is so important.Compared to the graphic novel, this film stands well. While most movies I grumble about things left out, for this one I was surprised about how much made it in! Really, for the other commenters who claim to have read Watchmen and still think this was still terrible, I wonder if they read any of the words next to the pretty pictures. With very few bumps this movie covers the entire plot rather well.As a stand alone movie for the people who haven't picked up Watchmen, it also holds its own very well - but you have to pay attention. If you're the sort who wants to just watch what's on the screen and not think much about the plot, then this movie isn't for you - and neither is the graphic novel, probably.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

I found myself actually watching birds on the feeder without knowing that my attention had been lost.I guess if I were to tell a friend about the movie, I'd say, watch it for the effects but if there's another movie on another channel that you've heard good things about, switch and only come back when you have some time to kill. ...A lot of time at 2 hours and 41 minutes.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

The best superhero movie ever.,"This movie is simply the best superhero movie in the world. It combines amazing story telling with superb special effects and action sequences.Why is there so much hate on this movie?What's not to like about a perfect narrative, perfect and brutally satisfying fight sequences, combined with awesome acting and some pretty decent twists? To me this is the best superhero film to date.But if you're going into this expecting something like the avengers or a funny, jolly, happy movie, you will be shocked.This movie is dark as sh*t and that's partially to do with why it's so good. It stays true to the comics, keeping the very gritty tone and combining it with subtle comedy that doesn't seem forced.

Unaffecting Graphic Violence And Nudity,"The success of ""Watchmen"" is another indication that we're moving away from everything that was dear to me in the movies. Technically brilliant, I presume, but not a single indication of humanity as we know it. In the dialog and intention, of course but in practical terms, zilch. The fact that Billy Crudup's Dr Manhattan sports an Olimpyan style penis that doesn't even make you blink should tell you something. It's all so far removed from human emotion. The men, Patrick Wilson, Matthew Goode and the aforementioned Crudup are thoroughly feminine. The women, Malin Akerman and Carla Gugino, beautiful masculine creatures. The only one depicting some shape of a real character is the wonderful Jackie Earle Hayley. To tell you that the film depressed me is to tell you only part of the story. ""Watchmen"" is an amusement park ride, one of the most boring I've ever taken. For the devotees of the genre, perhaps, this thing provokes some kind of pleasure, I don't know but for me this was torture. I'm not giving it a 1 (awful) because Mr. Hayley deserves some respect and I must say that Billy Crudup and Patrick Wilson are among my favorites of the new generation but they will be demoted in my estimation if they're going to put their talents at the service of things like this.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
For people who like to think about their movies,"I had never read the comics and must confess had not actually heard of them until the film's release. All i knew was that it had people in masks and apparently some strong violence.What I expected was a generic superhero movie (batman style) with a predictable plot and lots of action. What i got was a very good surprise. Set in an alternate reality whereby America won the Vietnam war and Nixon as president long after the legal limit for presidency the film succeeds in building tension as the cold war becomes much closer to another World War whilst at the same time retired heroes (or masked vigilantes) appear to be being picked out for assassination.I won't talk any more of the story but that combined with the brilliant acting all round and character development that attatches the viewer to the characters like no other film I've seen makes this one the top 5 films i have seen.But! this is only my opinion and the film would not be enjoyed by firstly those looking for another Dark Knight as I would place it in a completely different genre, it requires more thought with only a small number of action sequences and it is more about the deep story and the background than a face off between two nemeses. And also by those who find it hard to accept films as they are and need films to be realistic because, lets face it, a blue godlike man is hardly the most believable character.Overall the film is a great symbol of different perceptions on society and is everything I would enjoy seeing in a film although it wasn't until i saw it a second time i realized how great it is.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
The Best Watchmen Adaptation So Far.,"The fundamental premise behind Moore's cult comic Watchmen is that nothing good ever happens.A deeply cynical examination of power dynamics and oppression, the comics were previously called ""unfilmable"", not least because any attempt to make an adaptation required a huge budget, and the only likely source of such a budget woud be a major Hollywood studio - precisely the sort of powerful corporate entity despised in the Watchmen universe. Therefore, there is a deep irony that this film exists and that it is a wholly serviceable and compatible adaptation in regards the source material.Besides being a worthy adaptation, the film is a modern action/drama classic. Genocide, rape, forgiveness, friendship, impotence, revenge, murder, extra-judicial killings, counter-culture, recidivism, the military industrial complex, the US Govt., class, the media, racism, corruption, betrayal, megalomania are all starkly on display.The film is true to the source material because of its brutally honest cynicism played out using ridiculous costumes, deliberately over-the-top and earnest ""superheroes"" (just men and women, as weak and as vulnerable as the rest of us), while using the nature and magnificence of one single genuine superman/god to remind us of our inesecapable insignificance in the face of physics and the universe.A peerless classic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Many of the characters were distinct and intriguing, especially Rorschach, Dr. Manhattan, and the Comedian.

I Watch the Watchmen (Again),"My first viewing kept me awake during a transatlantic red-eye. Earbuds don't quite work for me so I kept it only on video. In a phrase, visually arresting, but by the end I rubbed my eyes and muttered, ""Um...say what?"" That didn't prompt me to read the source graphic novel. It still hasn't. But two recent re-viewings provoke the same odd attention from me as did The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: There be Acting here.Jackie Earle Haley is superb as a masked vigilante who feels faceless without the mask. Given what she has to play off of, Malin Ackerman keeps your attention throughout...sometimes that's all that's needed...and her scenes with a crudely made-up Carla Gugino remain special. And given what the FX crews do to him Billy Crudup's portrayal of a godlike being is singular and striking.Matthew Goode is spot-on as The Man Who Has Everything (If No One Interferes). Patrick Wilson is quietly hilarious as a conflicted and at times distracted Clark Kent who truly needs ""the suit"". And Jeffrey Dean Morgan captures perhaps the most prismatic hero of all, for compared with Haley's character who feels compelled to punish, Morgan's enjoys that.As I felt with LXG, you truly do start to believe in these deeply flawed paragons of...well, if not virtue then let's say idealism.

Phenominal and Nearly Perfect,"This is the pinacle of film and remains so true to the highly acclaimed graphic novel its based on.

The visuals and sountrack are flawless. The characters are entralling. The ending is the best film ending i have seen. Truely a masterpiece. The first time i watched it i was so dissappointed and bored expecting a superpowered team in a heavy action movie and it has now before my single favorite film of all time. One of only a couple drawbacks it has is the sex scenes and nudity though grossly exaggerated in early reviews of the film. One big moment near the end of the film is changed from the graphic novel but i understand and agree with this well explained plot content substitution.

One of the BEST movies of all time.,"Papai Movie Review - WATCHMEN I did something rare this week -- actually saw a movie in the theater in its opening week. It took WATCHMEN to pull that off. This short review is based solely on the movie and what I know about it; I've not read any of Alan Moore's graphic novels, but I have seen a couple others of his works as movies, especially V FOR VENDETTA (like it a lot!) and FROM HELL (excellent! about Jack the Ripper).WATCHMEN is a rather existential film, about the human condition and what being ""alive"" and ""safe from harm"" are about. It takes place in an alternate universe, late 1985, and Nixon is still president. Thanks to Doctor Manhattan (Billy Crudup) we won in Vietnam and the world has changed. However, the Soviet Union and its nuclear arsenal are still the arch enemy of the USA.Into this world a Watchman (formerly the ""Minutemen"" during the 1940s) is murdered, brutally. The film is ULTRA violent and not suitable at all for kids younger than 16. Watchmen are all humans without extraordinary powers (unless you count 'uber Bruce Lee karate moves' superhuman -- even by a woman, Silk Spectre II, played by the beautiful Malin Akerman of Sweden, has such highest level, 0.0001% top class karate skills). Watchmen are illegal in 1985 by a law passed by US Congress in the '70s. Their style of vigilantism is no longer welcomed. Doc Manhattan is still legal, works for the Dept. of Defense, and is the ultimate weapon of the USA. He has true superpowers transcending anything imaginable. In fact, he is god. He is superman. He lives in a quantum state and can be in multiple places at the same time. Like the OUTER LIMITS, he was created by accident during some science gone wrong in the 1950s. Now he is god and is an American! The movie's hero is Rorschach (Jackie Earl Haley of BREAKING AWAY ""Cutters"" fame). He still wonders the dark, shadowy back alleys kicking criminal's ass and is the film's narrator ala film noir style. He's a hell of a fighter and wants to solve the mystery of who killed the Comedian. The film's pacing, plot, intelligence, and direction is stunningly brilliant. It's an adult film that should appeal to all science fiction buffs and deep thinkers.If this stuff appeals to you, and the long length (2:40) of this movie, then go see it! I rate it a full 4-stars and it's now in my top 10 list of All Time -- it's that good.-Ken Papai, 3/13/2009",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Tell me Doctor...what do you see?,"Like Rorschach's mask, ""Watchmen"" is a movie that is open for interpretation. Never have I witnessed such polarizing opinions for a film in my life, and though some are just plain off topic, most whether good or bad can be understood and respected.I have been an advocate of this work for many years as the greatest piece of literature ever made, and to see it come to life in film was something I never thought was going to possible or feasible. I was proved wrong on both counts.I viewed the movie from a fan-boy and a movie-goer perspective, and have to say I was blown away on both counts. As a fan-boy, Synder worked so hard to keep the crux of the story true to form, and maintained the ""Big Joke"" aura throughout the entire film. Though the ending was changed, he still managed to get the same meaning and point across, which whether you hated or liked the movie, you have to tip your hat too. The characters were all well cast, especially Dr. Manhattan and Rorschach who I thought were epic. No one I am convinced could have produced a better adaptation of the graphic novel.As a movie-goer, this film challenged me to look beyond the traditional superhero genre and focus on a story where real people with real decisions and real problems try to live dual lives. It was a character study not just for those created in the movie, but for myself as well. You as an audience member are forced and challenged to make an active choice on how you feel about the end result, and how each character responds to it. This movie is about so much more than action, sex, violence, and visuals. It is an attempt to deconstruct and depict a different world, one that if it were true, may not be so different from our own.I urge you to see this film. Not because I love it, or because I want it to do well. Because I think it is important that the mainstream aspects of our entertainment get an alternative view, and ""Watchmen"" does precisely that. This is a story that needs to be told, and I am convinced will continue to be for many years to come.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Great adaptation,"I hadn't read the graphic novel, before I went to watch the movie. But I did read it after wards and I have to say, that the adaptation was really great. I for once loved it, even if a few things are missing from the novel. Those things (a side story mostly) will be reinstated into the movie in a future Blu Ray/DVD release, but should be available as stand-alone disc also.Apart from that side story, the ending is slightly different to, than in the novel. But I liked it, actually I liked every choice he made (even small costume changes, like the one Night-Owl went through) and I liked the actors in it too. Because I wasn't aware of the novel, the movie began with quite a ""Bang"" for me. I only had seen pictures of the characters up to that point and was kinda shocked, with how the movie began. In a good way of course. I can only recommend this movie, even though I know that not everyone enjoyed the movie (my niece and her friends weren't too excited about it, as they told me later).

A serviceable adaptation that caters mostly to fans,"""Watchmen"" was one of my favorite graphic novels growing up alongside ""V for Vendetta"" and ""The Sandman"". How it changed the comic book industry at the time of its printing is legendary.So naturally there had to be a big screen adaptation at some point, and Zack Snyder brought it to movie-going audiences ... with mixed results.So much of this film hit all the right notes at the technical level -- cinematography, music, costumes, special effects. It also has a great cast that clearly are committed to their roles.But Watchmen the movie lacks two critical elements that ultimately relegate it to being a mediocre film. First, the slavish devotion to the source material (except the part about how NYC is destroyed). This is a directorial choice by Snyder that locked him into a poor means of telling the story to audience members who had not read the book. Second, this was further hampered by the vast amount of world-building that had to be cut due to time limits that withheld critical context about how and why events unfolded as they did. Taken together these drawbacks affected everything from character relationships to explaining why the show was so dark and talky and not full of typical superhero action tropes -- like the fact that costumed super-villains didn't exist.In my mind, this was a repeat of another colossal mistake made just two years before in the movie, The Golden Compass. Like Watchmen, it had to deal with a massive amount of ""alternate history"" world-building that couldn't be included and also chose to closely adhere to the source material. So in both films you got scene after scene that were perfect renditions of moments from the book, but they lacked all the background that connected one scene to the next. Fans of both series could follow and admire the craftsmanship of seeing these worlds brought to life. Non-fans though were left scratching their heads about what was going on despite reams of visual detail and passing references to events and things they'd never encountered before.45 minutes into my theater viewing of TGC, I leaned over my movie-going buddy and asked him if he knew what was going on. He whispered back he was totally lost. Two years and 45 minutes later I asked him the same question during Watchmen. He said he was following but didn't understand a lot of what was going on.It was then I knew this movie would have a loyal fan base but the broader public reception would be tepid.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

This film really has it all, a fascinating and exciting story, in which Nixon and Henry Kissinger revisit a fictional past. Cool! Furthermore, the film has an ominous menacing atmosphere and very well put together ultra-violent action scenes where especially many villains are killed and maimed.

"""  In the Dark  world of Comics, there is a shattered  window called Reality ""","Growing up as a child, one of the first avenues to the world of reading came when I discovered my first comic book. Little did I know, within this fantastic world, there was a dividend which awaken my vivid imagination and allowed me to see the liquid, magical world of fantasy. Yet among those early comics, there were also a plethora of other fans who wished someone could make the comics come alive in a very real, adult sense. Such a wondrous world emerged when movies like ""Superman"" with Christopher Reeves and ""Batman"" with Michael Keaton were created. Although spectacular and entertaining, there was an ingredient missing. That torn sliver of fantasy arrived with this movie called "" Watchmen."" When you view this remarkable film, be prepared for a really exciting, gritty, physically gutsy, morbidly macabre 1950's atmosphere to envelop you as the director has reached the edge of the envelope and ripped it asunder. The story is set in the Alternative world of the 1980's. In this world, Nixion is re-elected for a third term and an aging group of magical super-heroes have been rendered obsolete. Mothballed into retirement, the world lumbers slowly into the unthinkable abyss of nuclear self-destruction and is terrifyingly real as reminded by the Doomday clock. The world needs help, but the Superheros are all powerless to help, until one night when one by one, for some unexplainable reason, they become the target of a mysterious and unknown character. One member Walter Kovacs (Jackie Haley) of the once incredible super heroes group called Rorschach, begins a dangerous investigation with the death of The Comedian (Jeffry Morgan). He is aided by Nite Owl (Pat Wilson), Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) and the Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman) yet, despite their combined powers, they face certain death as both the world and their group face the end of the world. The film is bursting with dark explosive black drama and nearly all the ingredients are present to create a monumental Classic. This is recommended as just that, a dark movie for anyone who was raised on Classic comics. Superb viewing. ****",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A comic book/superhero movie for adults,"This movie is NOT for kids. It has intense graphic violence with lots of blood and gore. There are sex scenes with nudity and on occasion a floppy dong thrown in for good measure.This movie has a gritty noir like feel to it, where the ""good guys"" are not looked upon favourably in everyday society. It takes place in an alternate 80's but it doesn't really have an 80's feel to it other than a lot of talk of tensions (possible nuclear war) between USA and Russia.The characters are established pretty quickly through opening credit shots of newspapers and various scenes that lay out that these super heros are not your typical squeeky clean goody two shoes types.Overall a well done action movie, good acting and an ok amount of action, I would have liked to have seen more but there was a lot of character development so it balances out. Would recommend if you like superhero movies and want to see something other that Marvel's version of a superhero. Logan is something similar to this in the sense you see the limbs getting lopped off and what not in that movie, same with this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Sex! Blood! Superheroes!,"WATCHMEN is the latest comic book to gain an adaptation by filmmaker Zack Snyder, whose film 300, based on the Frank Miller series of the same name, became a $210 million phenomenon in 2006. WATCHMEN is also the latest adaptation from the works of Alan Moore (V FOR VENDETTA, FROM HELL and, ahem, LEAGUE OF EXTRORDINARY GENTLEMEN all have big-screen counterparts). WATCHMEN, the comic, is deemed sacrosanct among the fanboy faithful and is considered to be one of those culture-crossing reads defined as a thinking-man's comic while also being a catalyst of change within its own genre giving comic books more mature themes.WATCHMEN, the film, is essentially a murder mystery that takes place in an alternate 1985 where Nixon is still President, the U.S. won the war in Viet Nam and superheroes are illegal. The Comedian, a costumed hit-man, is murdered causing another costumed hero, Rorschach, an ink-face blotted, overcoat-wearing detective of sorts who provides the film's ongoing monologue, to believe there is a growing conspiracy against former heroes. This conspiracy begrudgingly reunites some of these watchmen as they launch their investigation. Murder, violence and blood, lots of blood, follows.Snyder and screenwriters David Hayter and Alex Tse provide a faithful adaptation of the graphic novel providing exact panel-by-panel reproductions in some cases and maintaining a majority of the original dialogue. Coupled with spectacular F/X work, most noticeably on the electric-blue CG-character Dr. Manhattan, the film looks great. Where the film differs is the staggering amount of violence and gore added.WATCHMEN, as story, is definitely R-rated material. Rape, impotency, sex and the aforementioned Dr. Manhattan, who is naked for most of his screen time (he no longer requires clothes for he neither modest nor requires their protection), certainly sets this thematically apart from IRON MAN and DARK KNIGHT. But as genre-breaking as the story might be, WATCHMEN is still a genre film and must abide by certain parameters that bind all genre pieces. These are all ignored allowing instead the glorification of violence and a level of gore must more suitable for Snyder's zombie film than his superhero one. Violence and superhero action can go hand-in-hand and where Snyder does use such to lengthen scenes noticeably shorter in their original form (like Comedian's murder) in other instances, like the disturbingly-powerful near-rape scene and a mugging attempt, the filmatic violence detracts from the hero's true path, used instead to shock the mainstream audience and perhaps wow the teenaged videogamer.WATCHMEN can be described as a sophisticated, multi-layered mystery using superheroes as the backdrop and is not easily compared to such films as the X-MEN. Such a comparison is akin to relating RAGING BULL to ROCKY or BARTON FINK to ADAPTATION.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
dark ambitious world,"In an alternate 1985, superheroes and costumed vigilantes exist. They formed the Minutemen in 1940 but the . Nixon is the president and the world is on the brink of nuclear war. The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is killed by a skilled assassin. Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) thinks that somebody is trying to kill all the heroes. Dan Dreiberg aka Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson) is semi-retired and thinks Rorschach is too paranoid. Adrian Veidt aka Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) is a wealthy celebrity. Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) is the all-powerful all-seeing indestructible superhero. Laurie Jupiter (Malin Akerman) had put away her Silk Spectre identity and trying to maintain a human relationship with Dr. Manhattan. Her mother Sally (Carla Gugino) was the original Silk Spectre but is now a drunk.It's a dark ambitious world that Zack Snyder and friends have created. It may be too ambitious but they really gave it their all. It's got a great style. Some may complain about changes from the graphic novel. That's always a failed argument for me. I do have some minor complaints about the ending but I'm not saying there are easy solutions. It oversimplifies world politics and distorts human nature. Malin Akerman does a good job despite the naysayers. Dr. Manhattan digs into some existential questions. I like everybody especially Jackie Earle Haley's performance. There are many great aspects that they easily smooth out any bumps in the road.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Most will enjoy, fans will love.","Going in I had high hopes for Watchmen, as I'm sure all fans of the graphic novel will. I was not let down at all. The ending is different from the original, but I think this will make it more enjoyable for those who did not read it.May be slow for some, but I found myself thinking over and over that this looks and feels like the novel. There are few actions scenes, but the ones that are there satisfying. (The prison scene is exceptionally true to the novel.)After the movie, my friends that had not read the novel had mixed reviews. Some enjoyed it, but thought it too slow. Others enjoyed it all around and took it for what it was, and 1 out of seven didn't like it at all.

Cerebral and entertaining,"Dr. Manhattan/John Osterman (Billy Crudup): ""Why would I save a world I no longer have any stake in?""It's not difficult to see why geeks all over the world love Alan Moore and David Gibbons' Watchmen graphic novel heroes if the complex, cerebral, and entertaining film of the same name is any indication. Heroes filled with angst, lust, and revenge rummage around the screen trying to make sense of their existential lives while figuring out how to save the world from nuclear holocaust. As he did in 300, director Zack Snyder makes memorable images surrounding challenging ideas.It is an alternate world of 1985 when Richard Nixon has a third term facing the awful decision to use nuclear weapons against Russia rather than allow it to bomb us first. That the ex-Mask superheros Watchmen are variously found to cause the nuclear tension while they come back to save the world is the delicious complication of this challenging film.Long it is at 161 minutes, but satisfying it is in the range of human emotions and conflicts befitting bickering gods of Greek legend and Star Trek fantasies. In fact, the godlike Dr. Manhattan is an authentic superhero, a scientist transformed by bad experiment into a superman deficient in the emotions the gods, from Browning to Roddenberry, have traditionally coveted.Jackie Earle Haley's Rorschach/Walter Kovacs, providing the voice-over narrative about the return of the heroes, has a mask with floating inkblots, appropriately signaling the ambiguity of the hero and the world he is saving. But besides the satisfyingly ambiguous roles of the advanced X-Men like heroes, is a musical score equally spot on for meaning but also ironic in the extreme.For instance, after failing to rise to the occasion of intimacy with Silk Spectre II/Laurie Jupiter (Malin Akerman), Night Owl II/Dan Dreiberg (Patrick Wilson) eventually responds by being aroused after heroic activity with her accompanied by the strains of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah, both a sensual accompaniment and a send up of heroic seriousness. Additionally, Philip Glass's accompaniment to Dr. Manhattan's back story is close to perfection.The pure goal of all superhero stories is best described by Ozymandias/Adrian Veidt (Matthew Goode): ""And so began my path to conquest. Conquest not of men, but of the evils that beset them.""",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Waste of  time and money,"Another one of those crap movie which get hyped up by the media.

You're in here with ME!,"Greetings again from the darkness. While not a rabid, obsessed fan of Alan Moore's graphic novel, I certainly enjoyed the read and was anxious for the film (for about 15 years now!) Director Zach Snyder (""300"") stays very close to script with a product that should please all but the most persnickety fans.The film is a hard ""R"" rating and I just couldn't believe how many under 10 year olds were in the theatre. Why so many idiot parents? The violence and gore is brutal and graphic. The film unquestionably sets the cinematic record for most screen time for a blue penis. This is not Bugs Bunny folks, this is an adult presentation of a graphic novel ... and a very good and unique one, at that.Overall I was pretty pleased with the casting. Billy Crudup (Almost Famous) as Dr Manhattan (voice and head) was plenty mystical, Malin Akerman (27 Dresses) surprises as Silk Spectre II, while Carla Gugino was a bit over the top as her mom. Jeffrey Dean Morgan's too brief Comedian turn was excellent and Patrick Wilson was fine as the soulful Nite Owl and slightly wimpy Dan Dreiberg ... complete with the Clark Griswald eyeglasses. While the weak link was unfortunately Matthew Goode as Ozymandias, the unquestionable strength of the cast was Jackie Earle Haley as the hardened Rorschach. His scenes are fascinating ... as is that terrific ink blot mask!Snyder does a good job with the soundtrack, though it easily qualifies as the oddest placement for the great Leonard Cohen's song ""Hallelujah"". Stay for the credits to catch Leonard's ""First we take Manhattan"". The absolute best sequence of the film is the historical montage featuring highlights of the heroes' early years played over Dylan's ""The Times They are a'Changin'"". Sure the ending was changed out of necessity and it is a bit long in running time, but Snyder has done a wonderful job with the outstanding source material and this one can be watched and enjoyed a few times.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A visually stunning narrative that captures the novel almost page-for-page with passionate respect,"I read the graphic novel before seeing the film. In turn I went into the film knowing what I was about to see - a living embodiment of the story with an ending I already knew. In doing so I immediately found myself asking these questions upon the start and ultimately the entire way through the film: Will the narrative of the film respect the narrative my mind constructed as I read the novel? Will the shots structurally reflect the same visual craftsmanship of the novel in it's move from page to screen? To answer this, we have to grasp that the way your mind reads a book and watches a movie are two vastly different faculties. With a book - in this case, the graphic novel - your mind constructs the voices, the tone, the choreography and the pacing as a response to the static visual narrative. In films it's all done for you. Ultimately, I found myself able to recall the novel page for page as each scene progressed. Very little of the narrative is rearranged, and those elements that have been shuffled are structured in a way so as to make the character development happen smoothly for an audience that has not read the book. I think the cleanest and simplest way I can describe it is that everything necessary to the telling of this story has been included and everything unnecessary has been left out without damaging the final product. As far as capturing the true visual of the novel, I think the film was completely successful. It is one of those works where the novel itself would have been literally used as the story-boarding. Speaking strictly from the perspective of a comic book fan, one of our greatest desires in film adaptations is seeing how successfully the cast matches the look and feel of the characters. This is also near-flawless. If there is one difference it is in the women, but this is to be expected because from my experience women in comics are never drawn realistically - figures are too toned, too elongated, faces are sharper, and they almost always are overtly sexualized. Obviously, the genre demands it. And the film manages to capture that, the combination of grace, sexuality and strength in a real body and real costumes. Rorshach comes out exactly as I picture him in the novel - a gruff, Punisher-like force of violent vengeance, willing to go right to the edge to prove the ends never justify the means. The back story of his mask is not explained in the film, and it is one of those elements I would argue is it's own compelling detail in the novel, but is peripherally unnecessary in the film translation.I don't believe you have to read the novel prior to seeing the film. Nothing structurally critical in the novel is lost on-screen. The establishing of the political climate and the superhero generations is done perfectly fine. What you get from the novel is the understanding of the minor details - characters you see momentarily in the film whose lives are fleshed out in subtle asides throughout the novel. The characters of the young man reading the comic by the news vendor, the vendor himself, the heroine Silhouette, and so forth - to the unknowing audience these are inconsequential elements resolved in a manner that balances their introduction; to the book-first audience, it's almost a little feeling of satisfaction, knowing more than what's shown, as if the character was played by a close friend, allowing you to lean over and say, ""See that police-man? That's my cousin."" Most importantly, what you take from the novel is knowing how it ends. This is one area of the narrative that was modified for the film. To have taken the ending exactly as it was written creates two problems. First, the literal ending would require greater extrapolation into all of those minor characters and side stories (the majority of which are in true essence erased from the film's script), thus creating a longer movie. Secondly, the literal ending I believe would have been an imbalance in the narrative - in the greater context of the film it would be asking too much for the suspension of the audience's disbelief.I have to address the common observation of ""You have to read the book to appreciate the film."" What they're really saying is you have to know the details to appreciate the details left in and left out. I say appreciation must take two paths here: If you watch the movie first, you're likely to choose to appreciate the film simply for the cinematic art it is, and rank it next to others of the genre; if you read the book first you're more likely to appreciate it as an adaptation of a rich layered story, and draw the lines of comparison between the page and the screen. Taking these two perspectives I present my opinion. As a film, it is visually stunning, fairly well acted, and long in the same fashion that Dark Knight was long - you weren't watching the clock, you were watching the movie. As an adaptation, I feel it succeeded. I feel the filmmakers did everything in their power to respect the material at its core and it is successful for their doing so. Ultimately the biggest question is one nobody can answer due to the uncertainty paradox - does reading the book first in any way diminish the impact of the movie more-so than the inverse of this query? I can't answer this. No one can. What I can tell you is you need to make your own decision on the matter. Do not listen to the critics, just go see it and make up your own mind.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
More like DontWatch-Men,"Where do I begin. This movie has more padding than a hookers bra. This movie feels more like an instruction manual for the comic than actually trying to adapt it into a film. At times it shows how promising it could have been if only Hack Snyder wasn't at the helm. The biggest let down of the film has to be its lack of color. When I think of watchmen, I think of bright yellows and deep blues. But the only blue came from my extreme lack of interest during this 3 hour snooze fest. Don't get me stares on the whole comic within a comic side plot. I don't care if it was needed or not. It killed any sense of pace this film might have had.Now I bet your wondering if this movie is that bad why does it get a 6. Well the one saving grace for this movie is the action. Every fight scene is filled with vibrant amounts of blood and fire. It makes a crime scene look like a work of art and it is wonderful. The action is also slowed down enough to give you the sense your watching a comic panel. All in all it is a below average comic movie with a lot of heart but no pay off. Stay away and go watch Heros. It's almost the same plot but with a lot more time to build up the characters.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Orgasmic for comic book geeks, boring for the rest of humanity","In a way, this movie perfectly encapsulates everything that is a comic book - a pseudo-intellectual and pointless action/adventure for the sexually repressed.Let me first say that the special effects were dramatic. Rorschach's journey is also mildly interesting.However, the film's central gravity -- the characters' struggle with the prospect of imminent nuclear war -- is just dated at this point.Vietnam, Nixon, the Cold War -- give me a break! Who cares?! These themes have been hashed and rehashed a thousand times over, and it's no longer interesting. You are going to have to come up with something a little more inventive to keep the audience entertained. And if you're held hostage to a boring and trite comic book script, then you shouldn't have made the movie to begin with. The story, quite simply, SUCKS.There is nothing emotionally gripping about seeing a clown-faced Richard Nixon in a bunker somewhere grappling over whether to take the U.S. to Defcon 1 in an imagined parallel universe. There is nothing ominous about the Soviet Union in 2009. Had the movie been released twenty-five years ago, maybe things would be different.Further, the resolution to this childish fantasy is even less impressive - it's a straightforward rendition of the utilitarian vs. deontological moral debate presented to the audience as if the storyteller was the first person in the history of the earth to have ever contemplated it.Plus, I don't know about anyone else, but I don't need to see a blue dick waving around on the screen every five minutes.I would have rated this movie a 3 or 4 for the action sequences alone, but I feel a need to balance out all the hysterical 9s and 10s that are being assigned: 1/10.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Heck, even my girlfriend was going on about how much she enjoyed it.Also, I was concerned that my girlfriend, who hadn't read the comic, wold be lost, but this was not the case.

20th Century Iconography,"So, sitting in the theater there were a couple of guys behind me complaining about this movie. They had the same complaints as many commentators on this site. And before praising this wonderful adaption of a brilliant piece of pop literature, I have to admit that I absolutely sympathize with anybody who can't wrap his or her head around this film.A few weeks ago I saw ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" and while watching ""Watchmen"" I felt a certain kinship between these two films. Both stories depend on the willingness to accept a pretty far-out premise.In the case of ""Watchmen"", which is ultimately a collage of 20th century American pop culture, the viewer is asked to confront the myths of superheroes as a jump-off point for a meditation on life and all it's physiological and psychological entanglements. Which is really something rather high-browish.25 years ago, Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons took (as Gibbons once stated) their love for superheroes to a human level. They saw the flaws in our actions as essential to our existence as our fortitude, which leaves the the reader or the audience with an array of questions to ponder.From one Dylan song at the beginning to another one at the end, a visual firework and outfitted with a strong ensemble, director Zack Snyder takes a dense and very faithful adaption to those emotional levels that very few comic-adaptations are able to go to. Last years ""The Dark Knight"" widened the canvas of what a comic could be (something we nerds always knew), now ""Watchmen"" explodes it.Back to the guys sitting behind me. One of them said that this would be the last comic-movie he would go see. Well, if there was never another comic-adaptation to be, this would be a perfect last addition.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Grand,"I was completely hooked from the first page. Obviously, this, as is the cardinal rule with adaptations, particularly from one medium to the other, can never completely match what the source was. With that out of the way... this gets a remarkable amount of it right. Dr. Manhattan? Couldn't have been much closer. The Comedian? Just about spot-on. Rorschach? Basically so accurate that you need rather sensitive measuring equipment to find anything actually wrong with him here(Jackie Earle Haley... wow). At its best, this hits the mark with such a bullseye that it really barely gets better at all. This gets (some) crucial content and meaning from the books, too. In spite of a running time of about two and a half hours, it didn't lose me, in spite of knowing what was coming. This can boast astounding intensity, when it goes for such, and doesn't overwhelm by going too fast, either... the pace is impeccable. The plot is magnificent, with a couple of big changes made(and as expected, a lot cut out, there was no way to put that mass of material into a feature film length). The writing is great, the choosing and execution are masterful a large part of the way. Certain differences could be argued as being necessary to make this work, in this format. I'm not sure they are all good. There are clear opinions interjected. The acting is, with few exceptions(Akerman being a notable one of them), marvelous. The casting is quite nicely done. The action, the fight scenes, excellent, although it can perhaps be called unfitting to add more to them, and they sure did... but my gosh, it sure is amazing and entertaining to watch. The comics were mainly drama. The CGI is incredible. The stylization and visuals are immensely gorgeous and effective. This does elicit emotional responses, if maybe not as many as desired. The music is full of fantastic and interesting picks. The score is composed well. If one is familiar with the original, given that it is not entirely what Alan wrote(though it tries to be faithful, and often succeeds), you'll hopefully either enjoy this, or avoid it, realizing that you might not. If, however, you are not aware of it, this may confuse and not fully make sense to you(things range all the way from being over- to being under-explained). They made this bloodier/nastier. This has strong(and continuous) violence and harsh language(albeit fairly infrequent), and plenty of nudity/sexuality(at points, less covered than what viewers might be expecting), of varying tastefulness. I recommend this to any fan of the graphic novel, the concept, the dark tone and/or Moore. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Watchmen Review (SPOILERS),"I recently saw the movie ""Watchmen"" with two friends, and this is what I have to say about it. I am currently half way through the book, and I have to say that, so far, the movie matches up perfectly. Every street sign, and every book can be spotted on the set. I loved the reference to the book ""Under the Hood."" In the opening credits, you can clearly see the stack of books with the same title. The opening credits were very good, although they lasted WAY too long. Every time they did a transition I asked myself ""Is it starting yet?"" Many people know that CGI was used on ""Watchmen"" (the same technology was used on ""300""). The effects were VERY, VERY good. The scene were Jon Osterman is disintegrated is so genuinely done. They even had the hair on his arms stand up to show his fear and the process that is happening. Although this scene was good, the use of slow-motion in the rest of the film was WAY over done. Every 3 seconds something would move in slow-mo. Another thing I would like to comment on is when Dr. Manhattan is on Mars and he makes all of the cogs come out of the ground. That was very well done.I thought that the costumes were a little bit cheesy. Silk Spectre II's was probably the most pleasing costume, because it wasn't entirely super-hero-ish. The Comedian's costume is also very good.As far as acting goes, this movie was great! Malin Akerman made a perfect Silk Spectre II. She really dedicated her life to this role and it showed. I personally hate the show ""Gray's Anatomy"" and I hated Jeffrey Dean Morgan on it, but he really out-did himself as The Comedian(Edward Blake). From his evil looks, to his devilish laughs, he made the movie seem ""real"". Jackie Earl Haley is the only character I have a complaint about. When he had his ""face"" on, he sort-of over did the Rorschach voice. It sounded almost like he had throat cancer. But, in the interrogation scene, the way he responds to the pictures is outstanding! Also, in the scene where he is killed by Dr. Manhattan, his facial expressions and the the way he dramatizes the lines is AMAZING!All in all, ""Watchmen"" is a GREAT movie, with very few flaws. In my opinion, if ""The Dark Knight"" was Oscar worthy, so is this. ""Watchmen"" beats The Batman series by a LONG-SHOT! If you have not yet seen this movie, see it. It will absolutely blow you away.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

At around the 1 hour mark, things do begin to speed up. I think the movie could have been an hour shorter if it wasn't for all the drawn-out, slow-motion scenes.I had a bit of a love/hate experience with this film, there were times when I was really enjoying it, and times when I wasn't. All-in-all, it was a good movie - some level intelligence is needed to fully appreciate it though.The only thing that confused me was the fact that Matthew Goode's accent starts off being American and ends off being some weird British/Russian/American mix.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Snyder does Moore's classic graphic novel justice.,"I was really worried that Snyder's Watchmen film would fail. I started watching it, and throughout the first half an hour I was dreading the possibility of failure. It certainly felt as though Snyder would not live up to expectations.But when Watchmen got going, it was amazing. The characters were as interesting and complex as in the novel, and in particular I'd like to praise the performance of Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. His performance for this film has the same kind of impact as the late Heath Ledger had as the Joker in The Dark Knight. He is not in the movie. He is the movie.Based on the novel, the story is unsurprisingly very good, and the script can hold many surprises for those who haven't read the comic. The effects aren't ground-breaking, but look the part. The themes of duty and justice work in this film, and I just can't deny the pride I feel for Snyder upon having made this. I'm not his biggest fan, having only seen 300 besides this (and that wasn't especially great).If you love super hero movies, dystopian futures and gloomy, apocalyptic settings, you should enjoy this. It isn't for everyone; it's pretty violent at times, the soundtrack won't appeal to everyone, and its a long and complex yarn. But nearly everything worked, and I feel that it's a loyal, worthy adaptation of Moore's novel. Read the book first, and if you liked this, give this film a go.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
The Best Comic Book Film I Have Ever Seen,"Watchmen surpasses entertainment. It is a punchy, gutsy piece that's not afraid of being horrible,or of being gaudily superhero-y at times. It is a plethora of stories all perfectly entwined together with slick confidence. It's well acted, beautifully shot and actually feels like it's from a comic book - something Marvel should be taking note of. No blustering around trying to make twenty year old comics more hip - Watchmen manages to be just as powerful as when the comic was released whilst still very much of a 1980's setting. This could not be more perfectly realised than by President Nixon, here with a comic rubber nose that wouldn't be seen dead in Frost/Nixon, but here fits in with lycra suits and night goggles perfectly. The superheroes themselves are all the favourite hero clichés; one with an obsession with retribution, the timid one with all the cool toys, the one who's lost control, the one who's turned bad, and the giant naked blue guys. But it outgrows any sense of cliché with its merciless satire on what these people have become and each of their fates are superbly fitting. Not a film for the faint-hearted but nevertheless, you can have all the X-Men, Spider-Man and even Batmans in the world if I can have four minutes of Watchmen.

"Wasn't bad, but wasn't that great.","As a fan of the graphic novel, I was very excited to find a cheap copy of this movie and see it for the first time. But, I couldn't help but feel disappointed. I didn't hate the film, but there were flaws that kept piling up. For instance, in the beginning, the script was pulled straight from the book, and while I appreciate the effort to stick to the source material, that was not the way to do it, as it made the dialogue forced and feel unnatural. The actors did a fine job, but places like that made me wince at the way they delivered lines. Another problem I had was the lack of character development. it felt like they tried to build up each character in about five seconds, with minor flashbacks and with silent scenes in the opening credits, whereas in the novel, much more effort and time was put into each individual. The last big problem I had was the music choice. There are times when a non-obvious choice for underscoring fit in the movie (The opening with Bob Dylan's ""The times, they are a-changing"" or near the climax, with Jimi Hendrix's ""All along the Watchtower""), But there were some points were the music didn't work at all, like when Jon (Dr. Manhattan) was in Vietnam, the choice of underscoring made it seem cheesy and cheap. I do have to say though, almost everything else was good. The costuming, the sets, the cinematography, however, when you miss on two of the big ones (writing and score) you're missing to much in my opinion. All in all, I'm glad I watched it, and if you're into darker, grittier super heroes that are a bit more twisted, I recommend you see it, however, I do believe it's been over-rated.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Today, the Watchmen went from pages to the screen...","Decades in movie purgatory. Years in production. Months of anticipation. Zack Snyder's film adaption of the graphic novel 'Watchmen', once deemed 'unfilmable' by Terry Gilliam, has finally hit theatres across the globe, and its hit them like a sucker-punch to Alan Moore's groin. With the most important question at the forefront of proceedings being, not who would be watching the Watchmen, but who would enjoy the Watchmen. Would the source material be sacrificed for a larger potential general audience, or would they be alienated due to the faithfulness of the adaption? I myself would say the latter, to an extent...Zack Snyder's biggest achievement of the 'Watchmen' project has been his ability to replicate Alan Moore's source material as close-as-humanly possible. He has shown that while the project was clearly not 'unfilmable', it was, and always will be impossible to replicate a motion-picture clone of the graphic novel to an idealised reader's perception of perfection. However this did not stop Snyder from creating a film as faithful to the novel as we are most likely ever to see. It also did not stop him from alienating the potential move-going public outside of the Watchmen universe.The film conveys a linear narrative which in-turn and in due course examines the backgrounds and motivations behind the 'main' characters allowing those with no knowledge of the alternative period in which the novel is set to become acquainted, to an extent (which is down to how much the audience is willing to hand the film and receive back), with the new world in-front of them. That is not to say the film is perfectly paced and layered, at times the action is split between two contrasting events which can send the viewer from solemn conversation to vicious, blood and guts violence in a matter of seconds creating a complex structure which may have certain viewers scratching their heads slightly. However, this is one of those inevitable problems that come with trying to reproduce the source material as naturally as possible.Even the most stubborn admirer of cinema and the world around the medium must recognise the beautifully stylised scenery of the near-apocalyptic society in which the film is set. Pop-culture references abound, the streets lined with disgust, animosity and the raving magnitude of the conflicting personalities of the Watchmen members. While the sets, props and costumes draw you into a world of awe and astonishment, the brutality of the choreographed violence on-screen almost throws the audience off-balance and takes the viewer even closer into a world they may or may not have been familiar with. With the use of slow-motion in the various critical action sequences, Snyder allows the audience to take in every detail of every punch, of every strike and of every grimace of pain. Even those with the iron-clad stomachs may feel the need to turn and shudder as a meat clever is dropped into the suspecting skull of a local criminal. This is the Watchmen after-all, and they don't do things by half.This is an alternative, dystopian future and thus deserves characters with such ominous flaws and attributes that would accompany such a rich, illustrated world. The United States of America and the Soviet Union are at the heights of Cold War tension, with doomsday on an ever gloomy horizon, despite the emergence of the one, true superhero among the ranks of the Watchmen members. Doctor Manhattan (Billy Crudup), a blue, shimmering being of infinite power, who can distort the rules of nature i.e. large-scale teleportation and who also single-handedly, won the United States the war in Vietnam (which allowed Nixon a third term in office). Behind the glistening body of Dr Manhattan, you have Adrian Veidt (Matthew Goode), a billionaire entrepreneur and self-proclaimed 'smartest man in the world', who is one of the few Watchmen members to release their identity after the Keene Act and build an empire upon this image. The sexy 'Silk Spectre II' (also known as Laurie Jupiter) is portrayed by Malin Ackerman, the latex-costumed female of the group who took over from her mother who was in the first generation 'Minutemen' (Sally Jupiter played by Carla Gugino) and despite her relatively large role in the sub-plot with 'Nite Owl II/Dan Dreiberg' (Patrick Wilson), her performance at many times falls flat emotionally and she is weakest character in film full of strong, male performances. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is 'The Comedian', a twisted individual murdered at the beginning of the film, a man with a mutated conscience and morals who strives on the ability to get a job done at any cost. While Patrick Wilson as the second 'Nite Owl' and Jackie Earle Haley as 'Rorschach' give the most vivid performances as two complex characters, one a man fighting to find his identity beyond his persona as a crime-fighting vigilante dressed as an Owl and another without an identity, a hollow-shell of a human being who has lost faith in humanity and the emotions and logical conventions which make us human beings. 'Rorschach' is the closest towards a protagonist we are shown in the film and the graphic novel, because in this mutilated society, there are no heroes left.After watching the 'Watchmen' film I was left with a profound sense of enjoyment and satisfaction. Of course this wasn't perfection in the art film-making, the film had its visible flaws which is inevitable for any film of such a large-scale magnitude, however these were unnoticeable when I was drawn into the story, the lives of the characters on-screen. I had only previously read about the characters and their motivations in the dystopian world in which the Watchmen film is set, but to see them alive in such a visual spectacle, roaming, fighting, embracing, engaging, was nothing short of a joy to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Who Watches the Watchmen? .... We do!,"I'll go ahead and admit it: I have never read the original 'Watchmen' graphic novel (always wanted to, never really got the chance), and when my husband and I saw the first couple teaser trailers, we agreed on one thing: ""OK, so this is a superhero movie... but what the heck is it about?!?"" Still, we knew just how big the graphic novel was, so after reading up a little on the backstory, we went to see it on the opening weekend.When I went in, I wasn't sure what to expect: the reviews had been pretty split, and a few of my friends had even gone on to say that this was the worst 3 hours of their lives. Still, I was determined to see it, and for once, I was glad I didn't listen to my friends... 'Watchmen' is a dazzling tour-de-force that grabs the viewer's attention and refuses to let go.There is little that I can find to hate about 'Watchmen': the casting was great (the actors truly blend into their characters, none more-so than Jackie Earle Haley, who completely disappears into the role of Rorschach), the visual effects are great, and no matter how many subplots are going on (and trust me, there are a few), you still can't look away.The most important aspect, however, is that this is NOT a movie for fanboys. Zach Snyder was determined to stay as close to his source material as possible, so much that many people were worried that they only ones who would like this movie would be those die-hard fans who actually dress up as Nite Owl & Dr. Manhattan for the midnight showings (you know who you are). However, the movie is great, and does not just play out to those who already read the novel. As I stated before, I have yet to read it, and I was able to follow what was going on clearly.Alan Moore, the genius who gave us the original graphic novel, has apparently sworn to never watch this movie; that's his prerogative. He evidently doesn't trust Hollywood to do justice to his work, and I'm sorry he has such little faith, because Snyder does not disappoint. I highly recommend 'Watchmen' to anyone, young and old alike, this is one of those rare movies that you can easily see over and over again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
My favorite movie of all times!,"First of all, is the movie better than the Graphic novel. No, but what movie is better than the book or comic version. The reason that this movie is just so legendary is that it's bold move for mainstream movies. Its actually the only film to be almost (I said almost) exactly like the Greatest Graphic Novel of all times. Of course the novel is pretty long so they had to cut a few things, but the main important things are there. Also, the movie had the perfect amount of visual effect (not like Avatar, that was exaggerated) to just be blown away. I also enjoyed the concept of killing your enemy instead of knocking them out and putting them in jail. Newsflash: they escape and usually want revenge. The music was fantastic, especially Philip Glass song Priut Igoe and Prophecies. Acting was A plus work by Jackie Earle Haley who played Roarshach, Billy Crudup-Dr.Manhattan, and Jefferey Dean Morgan- the Comedian. The story was one of a kind and the ending for the movie was way better than that of the comic. The only mistake was to put Hallejuh soundtrack during a sex scene but other than that this was a perfect movie in every way.

"Entertaining enough, but a little disappointing.","I was very excited for this movie, as I had read the graphic novel it was based on, and loved it. I went in realizing that it would be different from the book of course, but this movie made some serious mistakes in casting that really took away from how great the story was.They paid a lot of attention to the camera-work and effects, which were excellent, and kind of reminiscent of Sin City. They also followed the storyline really well for the most part, and did a great job portraying the journal entries and flashbacks featured in the book to explain more about the story and the background behind the characters and the setting. The worst part about this movie was the casting. Decent enough actors, but a lot of them, especially Night Owl and the Silk Spectre just didn't connect very well to their characters, which really took away from the whole movie and made it hard to enjoy. Some of them just seemed like they were reading lines, without any real emotion or understanding of what they were about. The book is a very complex, emotional tale, that really intertwines with the development of the different characters' lives, backgrounds, and psychology, which just wasn't captured the way it should have been by these actors. I've seen some of them in other films which were really good, so I don't necessarily think it was a lack of talent... just a major disconnect with the meaning and feeling of the storyline.It's still an entertaining movie, and I'd probably watch it again, but overall, I was pretty disappointed that it wasn't as good as it really should have been.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Violence, blood, nudity and sex I highly recommend this movie","I had not heard much about this film or known of the comic book that well. I was however a big Synder fan after the awesome 300 and once i saw the excellent trailer i had to check this out. I went with absolutely no expectations but was completely blown away. I came out of cinema and remember been a bit shocked and after a few hours it hit me what an excellent movie i had just seen.The movie is visually striking with an intense story that revolves around really dysfunctional but interesting superheroes.The acting in the film was very good. These actors did such a surprising job playing their characters, and taking them seriously. The dialogue for the film is right out of the graphic novel and you would think it would be unnatural for people to talk the way the characters do in the comic. But it doesn't come off unnatural at all. These actors really became these characters and the performance that blew me away was that of Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. I know he has a mask on the majority of the time, but the intensity and emotions are heavy and strong and his growling voice is perfect.The action in the film was excellent, the fight scenes were choreographed extremely well and brutal as hell. You know exactly what you have in store for the film when the Comedian gets his ass kicked in the opening scene.The music and sound effects for the film were perfect.The soundtrack is great, and all the songs they chose to put in the movie were just right.(sex scene aside that is) The film is long but flows nicely and keeps you gripped from start to finish.Like 300 it is visually amazing with slick style which firmly puts Snyder as a new generation director. Regardless of who you are if you can handle crazy mature content such as violence, blood, nudity and sex I highly recommend this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Could Have Been So Much Better,"I liked this film, despite the negative tone that this review will take, but it could have been so much better. I put most of the blame on the director, who seems to be passionately in love with the slow-motion button on his camera. The film could have been at least half an hour shorter with the pointless slow-motion scenes taken out. The pacing was one of the problems, the other is that the opening 15 minutes or so (basically 'The Times They Are A Changing and the first fight) are so very good that the rest of the film has to live up to them, which it sadly only does sporadically.The acting was uniformly good, and on several peoples's parts, excellent, as was the set design. My problems with the stunt choreography would probably have been solved if they hadn't had to fit to the director's whims.The make-up was variable, with the make up on the original Silk Spectre being distractingly bad, which was a shame as Carla Gugino was brilliant as Sally Jupiter.As an adaptation it had its bonuses and its flaws, but I think that the change made to the ending was definitely a good idea. There was however something lacking, but I have no idea what the something was, hence the possibly mildly unreasonably low rating. A re-watch may move this up to 4 stars but there were too many flaws for it to be anything better than okay.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I've heard it's flawed as an adaptation, but I think it's good as a film","Watchmen is a film I've meant to revisit for ages, and now that Zack Snyder has a new film coming out, it seemed like the right time. I do miss being able to watch this rather uncritically as a teenager, viewing it merely as a dark/ultra-violent take on the superhero genre that went places the other superhero movies seemed afraid to go.Watching it again, I got the sense that I'd be more critical, especially after hearing about how it supposedly misinterprets the source material. But in all honesty, I've still not read the graphic novel, so I can't entirely judge that fairly. I guess from what I know of the graphic novel, for what that's worth (not much), I'd guess Snyder doesn't completely do injustice to the original story, but I'm open to the idea that he doesn't entirely get it. Or, more charitably, he does get it and everything but the ultra-stylised action scenes fit with the deconstructionist elements.I can't shake the feeling that some of Watchmen (the movie) wants to be cool, while Watchmen (the graphic novel) is intent on being grim and free of flash. But the refusal to play it 100% one way or the other does make the film interesting, and one that I'm constantly thinking about while also being kind of entertained by. It's a huge and ambitious movie that wants to be a more brutal and downbeat take on the superhero genre while also being spectacular and filled with savage action/excellent visual effects.Maybe don't think about it too much. There are still things to think about here, but I get the sense the interesting ideas touched upon here are explored better in the graphic novel. Still, it takes an unwieldy story and contrasting tones and smooshes them all into one movie that somehow works pretty well. I think it's one of Snyder's best, even if you could also argue it's one of his most flawed (there's some occasionally really clunky dialogue here, I can't deny it). It remains interesting and memorable, all these years later, and somehow feels like even more of a thrilling anomaly than it used to.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Less than I expected, but for whatever reason expectations were high","I had heard of Watchmen but never knew the premise beyond it being about superheroes directed by Snyder. Random chance had me select it based off of a movie scratch sheet, and to my surprise the description makes it sound similar to the amazon original ""The Boys"", which I love.The first 1.5 hours had me fully invested. It really was like The Boys but with faster story telling and the impressive ability to develop characters quickly. Halfway through the movie I actually cared about many of the characters as if this was a universe I was already familiar with. Where Watchmen fails is in it's capitalization on character development. The stakes feel high but the ambivalence of some characters to them is unappealing. In the last 30 minutes of runtime I genuinely didn't know if the ending was going to just be a to be continued with no proper plot wrap up and plans for another movie that would not come.The ending is bold and I appreciate that about it. Even 12 years later I haven't seen anything quite like it, but for some reason it wasn't as satisfying as I would expect. Most of this review has been criticisms of the movie, but all in all this is a solid film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Deep, complex, and shocking","The storyline presented in the movie was very deep and complex, wonderful if you're into the background psychology of people. You get some interesting ""prequel"" story lines to explain the current situation arising in the movie, which points out that even ""superheroes"" are often merely human. The one disturbing part of the movie for me was the sometimes blatant, drawn out violence in some of the scenes, including one in which one of the characters is seen repeatedly hacking another character to death with a meat cleaver. It might have been more artistically effective to ""suggest"" such violence than to so directly present it.This is definitely an ""adult"" film, due to the extreme violence. I would have rated this movie as NC-17, and I definitely would NOT take anyone under the age of 18 to see this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
An underrated masterpiece,"Zack Snyder's works are ahead of time. This movie is a great example of it. I mean does that movie look like it was made in 2009?

Pretty good adaption with some issues,"Being a massive fan of the comic by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, I recall being properly stoked on the lead up to the release of this movie back in the day. In the event, I was disappointed in some aspects but basically thought it to be a decent effort overall. Having seen it a couple of times since, and most latterly in the Ultimate Director's Cut, my feelings haven't changed, although certain things which bothered me at first don't so much now. It hardly needs stating but the original comic was an incredible bit of work and was sort of a development on the basic idea Alan Moore tried out in the earlier Marvelman from the marvellous British Warrior magazine, which existed in the early 80's. That idea of course was to devise a strip which deconstructed the superhero idea and play it straight. It's a good idea of course, because it allows us to do that thing we all enjoy - i.e. Having our cake and eating it. By that, I mean it treated the material deadly seriously, poked fun at the ridiculous aspects of it, while still essentially delivering a superhero story in doing so. Watchmen was the last word on this kind of thing and it is a colossal and complex bit of work.Set in an alternate reality of 1985, it looks at the history of the various costumed avengers who fought crime in New York City and brings things up-to-date via the unexpected emergence of the superman and how this happening changed the course of history, in direct comparison to our own. There's a lot more to it than that but that's a sort of bare bones outline. The first thing I have to say is that, as far as I'm concerned, this is a very honourable attempt at adapting a bit of work which was always hitherto considered unfilmable. They don't deviate from the story very much up until a significant change towards the end and there is a real attempt to capture the look of the comic. This is worthy of praise because if they hadn't done this, there would be a lot of criticism. I guess though, one of the things which this adaption made abundantly clear to me was that what is written on the comic page - no matter how well written - doesn't always translate on the screen as successfully. To this end, much of the dialogue seems a bit stiff and the character of Rorschach is even more egregious in that he is given a ludicrous hard-boiled voice, which felt very misguided. A film such as Sin City achieves this dialogue transition much more successfully in that it is a highly stylised bit of work with no accent on realism whatsoever. Watchmen has the trickier task of presenting something fantastic, yet grounded in dramatic reality and the film never truly nails this. It feels like there's a fair bit of good quality surface but the nuances are often buried in the mix.The Rorschach character loses a dynamic in the film, with Jackie Earle Haley not exactly putting in a bad performance but the character struggles to resonate, like on the page. Dr. Manhattan comes off worse, with some distracting CGI used where a more minimalistic approach would have worked far better - Billy Crudup does try to inject an otherworldly element to him, yet Crudup often plays the character less like he is detached from reality and more like he is detached from his brain. Much better was Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl II and Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian, while Malin Akerman is a devastatingly beautiful Silk Spectre II. On a final note, I wouldn't really recommend the Ultimate Cut, as the Black Freighter sections didn't really add up to an awful lot, when you take into account the three-an-a-half-hour run-time these additions result in. Overall, this is certainly a good version of this material but it does, once more, illustrate that excellence in comics cannot be so easily replicated on film, even with admirable attention to detail.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
New Direction For An Aging Genre!,"Bland this film ain't! The tired and bloated ""superhero"" genre is turned inside out, while over a thousand reviews indicate this movie got us all thinking. (A rare accolade for movies in these de-intellectualized times).But, sorry, nil points to the Hollywood Studios for not awarding Alan Moore a writing credit... Poor form. His literary genius made ""Watchmen"" possible.Okay: the movie. Well, this isn't family entertainment. It's disturbing in parts, often violent, even brutal. Watchmen takes us to dark parts of the human psyche, then stands back with us amid the chaos as if to say: Judge for yourself! An extraordinary performance by Jackie Earle Haley (as Rorschach) made for compelling viewing. Smooth, seamless direction by Synder delivers absorbing cinema, despite a 2 hour journey. It's unlikely you'll check your watch.I can see why reviewers mention Watchmen and Bladerunner in the same breath. A few stock characters (""Nite Owl"" is a little too much like Superman, lets face it) and a few all-too-familiar fight sequences in alley and prison yard mean I cannot attribute ""masterpiece"" to this brave, mainstream offering. Bladerunner remains more original.It's a good film, working hard to take a bland genre in a new direction. Just don't let the kids watch it until they're at college!

Too much story too little time,"If you think about it, most great novels never make good movies, in fact I can't think of a single one. Maybe the writers and directors feel too much pressure to include everything or maybe it's just too hard to beat the original. I mean, it wasn't intended for the screen, so what do you expect right? Well, anyways...I think this film had a lot of good elements in it, but it just didn't come together perfectly like an original screenplay would have. Don't get me wrong, I actually liked the film...It was only towards the end I began to enjoy it, I felt the first hour was pretty hard to watch. I think the Snyder had a lot on his hands, and maybe if he spent a little more time with the script, and a little more time editing it, the film would have come out much better. I thought that the star of the film was Rorschach, with his Clint Eastwood style presence, he was interestingly played out. The action was good, story was good, visuals were good, everything was good. But nothing was excellent. Maybe my expectations were just too high. The novel and trailer nearly blew me away.But, I've gotta admit, Snyder has got some balls trying to make a film like this. I was surprised he got away with the violence and the studios were OK with it. I respect him for pushing the edges of what can or cant be done in this type of genre. Snyder is one of the few directors out there right now that have potential to be great, but I'm afraid it's probably not going to happen anytime soon. A lot of lessons to be learned from this one. Either way, good luck with the next film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Amazing Characters, Iconic Imagery, A feat of Visual Storytelling.","I enjoyed this movie, a bit more than most of the other Zack Snyder movies. This can be attributed to the incredibly smart and cerebral screenplay by David Hayter(Snake?) and Alex Tse, ultimately adapted from the very popular graphic novel. The setting, tone, characters, soundtrack, cinematography all are just spot on. The cast does a great job, I love how real and gritty their performances really were, each cast member played their role perfectly, albeit maybe excepting a few. Some characters were just so well portrayed(Rorschach, Dr. Manhattan) I was baffled at how real these people really were. Rorschach reminded me of a more hateful, less suicidal Travis Bickle, and was played wonderfully by Jackie Earle Haley. But this movie does sometimes wear on the mind, it isn't very accessible or fun(not counting that as a negative). I did watch the Ultimate Edition which had the extra Tales of the Black Freighter, and it was mostly exhausting. The movie also has some very out of place scenes, that made me go, ""huh? why was that there?""Ultimately, I enjoyed this movie a lot, the duo of Zack Snyder and Larry Fong produce some truly ""Unforgettable"" scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Great effects but plot lost in translation,"""Watchmen"" the book has been called one of the 100 best novels of all time. If that's the case then ""Watchmen"" the movie is missing a lot. I've not read the book but I've seen some of the art and from a technical stand-point director Zack Snyder and his team have done very well for themselves. Just the plot is lost in translation and it's one big 3 hour mess, a long and unpleasant string of flash-backs, subplots, exposition, bloody violence, and overall just a flat-out exhausting jumble of different things that never get a chance to breathe or work into any sort of entertaining narrative. It makes you wonder just how anyone thought Alan Moore and Dave Gibbon's multi-layered graphic novel really could have ever worked on film? I was hoping to love this movie. Instead I wound up enjoying the Advil I took after it was over.The time is 1985 and the soviets are about to attack within the U.S. It's 5 to midnight, which is like saying code level orange. Tricky Dick Nixon has been elected to a third term and, in the first of many flashbacks, we find that throughout current events between the 1940's-1980's regular human beings with no super powers have donned masks and costumes and become superheroes until Nixon forced retirement on them. When the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is killed, it effects the group in different ways. Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) is determined to uncover the murder, while Dan Dreiberg, formerly Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson) and Laurie Jupiter, formerly Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman) just seem content to live normal lives, and Ozymandias (Mathew Goode) has turned his hero status into financial gain by harnessing cleaner energy. Meanwhile, the only hero who actually has powers, Dr Manhattan (Billy Crudup), is trying to divert the Soviet crisis while at the same time deal with rumors that his blue glow has caused his colleagues and several others to get cancer.This is really only the set-up. From here it goes in different directions but still doesn't really add up to much. The script by David Hayter and Alex Tse is so backstory-crazy it makes ""Memento"" look linear, centering on everything from a controversy between the Comedian and Jupiter's mother (Carla Gugino), a stint between him and Manhattan in Vietnam, Manhattan's creation, a lot of childhood stuff with Rorschach and Jupiter, various scenes where these characters become disheartened or disillusioned, and a lot more. And when not in flashback, we're treated to everything from a character vacationing on mars and building some indescribable circular thing, Dan and Laurie having odd super hero fetish-sex, a prison riot, an irrelevant revelation about a character's father, and of course so much more. And then we have the actual action, which seems to come just as randomly as the rest of this movie and features every bloody thing from cheeks being bitten off, arms being chopped off, a meat cleaver taken to a guy's forehead, and unexciting slow-motion fights where arms, legs, and various other body parts are broken in two.The movie spares nothing in regard to what's in the book but surrounded by all this bloat is some type of deep, mature point about heroism and humanity that just never comes through. The movie holds itself out as too serious and important. The constant shifting back and forth and from subplot to subplot, the scenes that just can't play out dramatically because they suffer from crammed explanations and characters who seem to just randomly come and go rather than feel apart of the movie just make this effort a bore. And what's worse is that most of these people are either just assholes or bland, monotonous, and cheesy and it makes it very hard to be anything but indifferent to them.If anyone makes a jump to being somewhat interesting here it's Jackie Earle Haley's Rorschach. He's a gruff-voiced bad-ass and I loved the character. The rest don't really make a dent, but Akerman and Crudup respectively increase the sexy by a lot. As does Zack Snyder. Like most comic book movies nowadays, he gives it a dark, seedy, grimy, and depressing look that complements the effects nicely. I thought the make-up, especially on Nixon, gave the movie a nice comic touch and Rorschach and Dr. Manhattan are each done beautifully, the former with his entrancing mask of moveable ink and Manhattan with his gorgeous blue electrical light and ability to duplicate, transport himself, and take things apart and put them back together just with a move of the hand. The Owl copter, the circular thing I described on mars, and the big ball of light that comes in the finale all look great as well.This movie also has one of the best soundtracks probably ever put on one CD. Simon and Garfunkel's ""Sound of Silence"", Hendrix's ""All Along the Watchtower"", and the movie opens up with a Bob Dylan ""Times they are a Changin"" montage. In general this movie was just lost on me though. I have no idea where it was trying to go or what any of it means and to me it just looks like a nice-looking jumble of different things that just didn't work.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

I haven't read the comic novel nor knew anything about this except the teasers which I've seen on TV (or before feature films in the theater). So all I'm going to comment on is what was presented to me on the screen this afternoon.Very interesting characters; the back story on each was necessary and well done. While there were a few minor details that were left unexplained, my son (who did read the comic novel) explained them to me after the movie and I felt the director was correct in leaving them out of the movie; they were unimportant.However, I will state the obvious: This movie is w-a-y long; probably too long, IMHO. As I'm not carrying the baggage of the fan-boys, I could see a few ways of cutting 30 minutes out of the film and making it even more compelling (although I'm not saying the film was painfully long - except maybe for my bladder). But The Dark Knight was also a bit on the long side yet compelling so these directors have a vision and that's why they're hired, right? I don't want to give away any secrets or ruin any surprises. The characters are (mostly) very complicated and Rorschach...wow...Jackie Earle Haley is wonderful in that role. Let's just say he's the roughest, toughest SOB I've seen in the movies in a long time. I'd nominate Haley for a Best Supporting Actor award; and I think that's what I will remember about this film.The producers should be happy that all of the money they spent (well, except for that nonsense about who actually owned the rights) was right up there on the screen. Lots of special effects, plenty of red paint (y'know, blood) and it didn't feel like anyone phoned in their acting.So, from an old guy who's not a fan-boy (of this franchise, anyway), I'll recommend you go see it but DON'T BRING ANYONE UNDER 13 as this will definitely give them bad dreams.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Slick and realistic, Watchmen is hero of all superheroes","In a time of political warfare between Russia and The United States, an ex-superhero is murdered which encourages vigilante Rorschach (Haley) to investigate and get back into his superhero ways.July 2008 and the eagerly anticipated The Dark Knight is released, predictably smashing box office records. Taking the comic book genius and turning it into an enthralling fantasy thriller with sweeping direction and an impressive Oscar winning performance by Heath Ledger. So had we seen the greatest comic book adaptation? Yes, until now.Superhero films are usually made for family viewing to gain high profits and to be seen by viewers of any age and so we see realism in a constricted context. Sex scenes, violence, blood and drug uses are all limited but Watchmen is brilliant. It is one of very few films in the genre to throw caution to the wind and do what is right in the plot's context. The direction by Snyder does not shy away from anything and has all the right elements to reflect the time of the plot and therefore you feel rewarded for the film's honesty to portray it as it is.Watchmen, adapted from Alan Moore's graphic novels, hits all the right buttons. Great characters, stunning visuals and a cool collection of action sequences and sophisticated direction. But this is so much more than a superhero flick. It has real life issues and agendas and though the Spider-Man franchise justifies this, Watchmen feels more accurate and appreciative without diving too much into a soap styled genre. For starters we open into a politically stubborn government debating over the threat of war and how it will affect the world. This 2009 picture also looks at the use of superheroes in the community and how the police forces are corrupt and enforcing a stubborn grip on the nation.Whereas this looks at the nation with reliance on superheroes or vigilantes it does not effectively reflect how the police are affecting the system but looks more into the political agenda of the President's motives and impulses.Zack Snyder's choices are effectively established to justify that sense of action and crime and when needing to, that intense feeling of a thriller, none more so than a great opening scene with the Comedian.Sam Raimi and Christopher Nolan have made names for themselves as established directors in the superhero category with Spider-Man and Batman and Snyder uses a fast paced style in comparison but adds a spicy sense of energy through some effective slow down motions that rival the Matrix and in conclusion, makes Snyder a hero for creating arguably the most riveting and surprising superhero film to date.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Word for word, but still somehow an unfaithful adaptation","The movie is almost a word for word translation from the comic, but through a clear misunderstanding of the source material and directorial incompetancies it somehow manages to be unfaithful. Both Silk Specters are are not at all like they are in the comics, again this is without changing a word. Absolutely impressive actually. Dr Manhattan, Nite Owl, and Rorschach are done well though. Zack Snyder is a 50 year old 12 year old and any good performance given by the actors is more than likely in spite of his direction.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Sub-adult adaptation of the comic,"I went in with no expectation or disgrunt. I was pleasantly surprised. Not extremely, just pleasantly.This is one of those movies no one has any idea how it will be until it is released. There is enough violence, nudity and gore in there to satisfy the bloodthirsty and perverted movie-goers, but also enough (super)human drama not to make this into another poorly made movie adaptation.The plot is, as with most comics, quite shallow. But not as obvious as Iron Man, Hulk or even Batman Begins (,etc..). What's unusual is the attempt at emphasizing the relationships between the characters. However, the 160+ minutes of the movie simply isn't enough to make the audience feel enough attachment to the characters.CGI, in my honest opinion, is just like every other movie these days. It used to be a novelty, now it is just plain over-used. A note must be taken in that the movie was made to simulated a world where handphones and portable computers have not come of age, a world where younger audiences may not be able to relate to.The nudity and sex scenes were fine. It is unusual for scenes like this to appear in this genre. But isn't it about time? This movie is worth at least 80% of your ticket price.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Inevitably Everybody Will Watch The Watchmen,"Unfortunately I have to argue that it doesn't deserve all the attention. Now I LOVE the Watchmen comic book. It is a piece of literature that should be treasured like most classics.Honestly, going into it I thought this movie would result in one of two ends. Train Wreck or Eternal Glory. The Outcome. This movie is a train whose journey to eternal glory was cut short due to a lack of key locomotive parts. But not a wreck.Seeing the story play out on screen was exciting and frustrating. Witnessing all the missing elements of the book was too much distraction, keeping me away from feeling fulfilled. Others in my group, new to the story, felt it was confusing. Not having enough emphasis on transitions between past and present. Though it does have some stunning visuals, and wild (although unnecessarily brutal) action that OD'ed on slo-mo. Personally, this movie seems like an audience pleaser. Like they took the most stirring, emotional comic book tale and numbed it down enough to give people something to clap at. This is evident when (readers of the book will notice) the stories biggest events unfold with little emotional response. Like they were glossed over. Or witnessed from the window of a passing train.Shame. Could have been Great.2 Things HAVE to be said. The make-up and music are the WORST in cinematic history! The music is just inappropriate and awkward for the moments they are attached to. Surgically removing your connection to the film every time a tune strikes up. But the make-up. My God the awful make-up. So many people giggled at the ridiculous faces of Richard Nixon and the elder Silk Spectre. Almost as many as those giggling at Dr. Manhattan's glowing blue... well you'll see. Everybody will see it no matter what the movie deserves. You can't fight the inevitable hype. Right now People are too excited, and they WANT this movie to be good so much they won't invest any stock in the bad reviews. Otherwise we wouldn't ever have to suffer through a Transformers 2.I once thought Alan Moore was crazy for not wanting anyone to interpret his work into movie form. I saw From Hell, thought nothing of it. Saw the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and thought, ""Yea, they should leave his stuff alone."" Then V for Vendetta and I switched sides, ""Maybe it can be done."" Now with Watchmen, just respect the mans wishes and don't mess up his stuff. Its too intricate, and too precise for it to be diluted with someone else's interpretation.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Alan Moore's Original Comic Book Dialogue Shines,"Comic books and their film counterparts have gone through an interesting evolution over the past 85 years. There always has been a dividing line between the serious and the ridiculous. Even as far back as the 1930s and 40s, (when the comic industry hadn't quite run into the evil comics code authority just yet), they were able to sell their product as adult entertainment. However, once the 1950s and 60s arrived, there was this divide, that erupted between comic book creators, who had to survive in the post comic's code era and a public, demanding serious, believable stories, that could stimulate the articulate reader and a more sophisticated audience. Comics became an outlet for kids and were stereotyped beyond what they really represented. This continued through the 1970s and many comic book companies, were having a tough time. Except, for Marvel, who managed to tap into a kid's friendly/sophisticated plot-line structure, that worked on both ends.The movies and television adaptations were experiencing their own growing pains too. The great serials from the 1930s and 40s, managed to sell themselves as, good for all audiences, but low production values made it difficult to be serious. It was the same with the Adventures of Superman (1952-1958) TV show. It was such a childish product, that even the star himself, felt like a goofball doing it. When we got into the late-1970s, the movie theaters finally managed to deliver the comic book goods. TV, not so much. Then came the glorious 1980s. A major paradigm shift began. The advent of cable TV in homes and home video helped to break down certain barriers and serious, sophisticated, mature subject-lines began to seep out, even into science fiction and comic book genres. The audience was ready to see their heroes become more sophisticated, more human than ever, plus the comic book system was finally ready to let the creators deliver.1986 would be a banner year for comic books, especially DC. That year, Frank Miller would deliver to us his classic, masterful take on the Batman mythos with The Dark Knight Returns (1986). John Byrne would give us his updated vision of The Man of Steel (1986) and Alan Moore, would release the groundbreaking graphic novel, Watchmen (1986). By the end of the decade Hollywood would finally get it right with Tim Burton's Batman (1989). So, 20 years later, after Tim Burton established the guidelines for what comic book film adaptations should be like, and 23 years after the release of the Watchmen graphic novel series, director Zach Snyder, early in his career, gave to us Watchmen (2009). It was worth the wait. I do not think the film would have been as good as it was, if it was created shortly after the graphic novels came out. Watchmen (2009), needed other films, like Spiderman (2002), X-Men (2000) and various other films to come out, for it to be accepted. First of all, this is a 165 minute film, which passes by quite fine, but it had to cover a lot of ground. That amount of content for almost three hours probably kept the film from being perfect. With that to deal with, it all fell into place, because the audience now knows, what to expect from a film such as this, because of those movies, that came before it.One of the great aspects of Watchmen (2009), is its ability to cover all the hot topics. It takes care of all the social issues, that parallel real-life, such as prejudice, cancer, rape, fear. It also manages to cross those issues with the more, comic book-styled, type-of issues, such as, nuclear holocaust, men in funny tights and Mars. Director Zack Snyder's choice to use the dialogue from the graphic novels, almost word for word in the film, was a brilliant move. This attention to detail was a nice commentary, on the excellence of Alan Moore's story. Watchmen (2009), is a film that has a structure. It explains many of the situations and visual images seen, with believable detail. It has logically built scenes, which strengthen the believability factory. From the Comedian's blunt explanation of the American dream, to Dr. Manhattan's girlfriend vomiting, after he teleports her to the deserted landscape of Mars. From understanding what a world might look like, if there really was a fifth Nixon term, to Dr. Manhattan being naked all the time. His consciousness has moved onto such a higher evolutionary plane than us, that the concept of clothing is irrelevant. Great stuff in this film.PMTM Grade: 9.0 (A-) = 9 IMDB.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"The ""Apocalypse Now"" of superhero films","Based on Alan Moore's graphic novel, 2009's ""Watchmen"" takes place in an alternative 1985 where Nixon is serving his fifth term and costumed vigilantism is illegal. A former masked crimefighter named The Comedian is murdered, prompting his previous teammates to investigate the crime. Things get complicated as the backstories of most of the Watchmen are revealed and worldwide nuclear war looms.For some reason I was never interested in the Watchmen and therefore never read the graphic novel, even though I had the opportunity. Why? The fact that it took place in an alternative reality turned me off, as did the peculiarities of the team members which, I later discovered, Moore intended as satire. That said, this is mind-blowing. ""Watchmen"" is an adult-oriented superhero flick with a convoluted plot, strong characters and total originality. The latter two score high marks with me any day.Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) stands out with his gravelly voice and right-wing ideology, although he's not very likable. He's impressive yet, at the same time, kind of pathetic. The character was based on Steve Ditko's The Question.The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) exudes great charisma and is reminiscent of The Punisher, if he were a jokester. Unfortunately, The Comedian's arrogant & hotheaded and has a weakness towards the ladies, not to mention cold-blooded murder.Night Owl (Patrick Wilson) is another strong character, obviously based on Batman or Blue Beetle. Unlike the previous two he's very likable. I always thought his costume looked really lame in the graphic novel but, as depicted in the film, it kicks axx.Dr. Manhattan (Greg Plitt), named for the Manhattan Project and based on Captain Atom with a dash of Mr. Fantastic, is an almost God-like being who can do pretty much anything. He's so detached from the human experience that he walks around totally nude and has no time for his woman, Silk Spectre II. He'd rather hang out on Mars -- literally!Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman) stands out due to her sexy costume more than anything else, not to mention Akerman's drop-dead-gorgeous looks. The character was based on Phantom Lady and Black Canary. Silk can't handle Dr. Manhattan's increasing aloofness and consequently diverts to Night Owl for human warmth.Silk Spectre (Carla Gugino) is Silk Spectre II's mother and has a pretty significant part. Like her daughter, she's hot, albeit in a whole different way.Ozzyosbourne, whoops, I mean Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) is the least developed character and loosely based on Charlton Comic's Thunderbolt. He's ultra-smart, ultra-quick and kinda foppish.Another highlight is the hypnotic score by Tyler Bates mixed with a quality soundtrack (e.g. ""The Sound of Silence,"" ""All Along the Watchtower,"" etc.)BOTTOM LINE: The film is long, dark, mature, dialogue-driven and convoluted, but the strong characters and originality win the day. No moronic ""blockbuster"" trash here. Not to mention Silk Spectre II and her mother are extremely easy on the eyes. As far as superhero flicks go, there's really nothing else like ""Watchmen."" It's even more atypical than the X-Men and easily one of my favorite superhero flicks, maybe even THE favorite. ""Watchmen"" is like the ""Apocalypse Now"" of superhero films!RUNTIME: Theatrical Cut: 162 minutes; Director's Cut: 186 minutes; The Ultimate Cut: 215 minutesCOMPARING CUTS: I own both the theatrical cut and Director's Cut. Although the theatrical version is just fine, the DC is worthwhile for extended dialogue to existing scenes in the theatrical cut; the biggest addition is an attack on Night Owl's Mentor, Hollis Mason, at the hands of a thug gang and Night Owl's subsequent brutal revenge at a bar. Despite the convoluted plot, I had no problem following the story in the theatrical cut, even though I've never read the graphic novel. The filmmakers did an excellent job cutting out the fat in the theatrical version. So don't think you'll need to purchase the DC to understand the story; it's not necessary. My recommendation is to check out the theatrical version first and only purchase the DC if the theatrical cut left you wanting even more, which is what it did for me. Even so, I PREFER the theatrical cut; it's leaner and just all-around better.GRADE: A.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Far better than the comic.,"Let me first off state that I am an avid comic book reader and have been since the early 90's. I believe that comics are the greatest entertainment media combining literature and art to create something special. However, I hated Watchmen. It was both dull, drawn out (pun intended), and had poor art. I'm sure it was great in the 80's, but I read it in TPB format in early 2005. The story was compelling but could have been told in 6-8 issues. Now the movie...that's another story. I reluctantly went with my father so that he wouldn't have to go alone and I couldn't believe it. The visuals alone were great but the way they condensed the story created a much more enjoyable experience. If you like dark, anti-heroes and a compelling story, this is the movie for you. I'm glad I went. My guess is that Alan Moore is scared of how good the movie will be. He didn't seem to feel too strongly about The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen which was horrible but he's avoiding Watchmen. He's just an arrogant ass that will miss out on something more than a movie; he'll miss out on a great experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"WATCHMEN {Theatrical Version} (Zack Snyder, 2009) ***","A friend of mine had been so disappointed by this one that he wrote so as to spare me from wasting the cost of a cinema ticket and three hours of my life! Having finally caught up with it myself, I could not disagree with him more – not just that but, due to the film's essentially muddled plot line (despite an overgenerous running-time of 162 minutes), I even went so far as to acquire the mammoth 215-minute ""Ultimate Cut"" of the film immediately afterwards! To me, this is easily one of the better among the recent flood of comic-strip-inspired blockbusters – with, unsurprisingly, perhaps the one to have the biggest heart. Given Heath Ledger's somewhat over-hyped performance as The Joker in THE DARK KNIGHT (2008), Jackie Earle Haley's turn as Rorschach here (with his classic faceless, yet sentient, mask and mouthing the film's one outstanding line to a bunch of angry jailbirds i.e. ""You don't seem to understand: I'm not locked in here with you – you're locked in here with me!"") proved no less memorable or genre-defining. Incidentally, before the project was announced, I had no prior knowledge of the source material (let alone its quasi-legendary status) – so there were no preconceptions about the rigorousness (or not) of the adaptation involved on my part (the result features both uncompromising violence and surprising, albeit vaguely laughable, sex scenes). By the way, having watched all three of Snyder's films (again, this is clearly superior to the others), I would like to see him tackle an original subject next – since DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004) was obviously a remake (of a horror title held in very high regard by many, though not myself!) and 300 (2007) was both that (of the 1962 Rudolph Mate' spectacular) and, like WATCHMEN itself, a cinematic rendition of a graphic novel. What I really liked about this one is its blending of outright fantasy (apart from the typical sci-fi elements of a scientist rendered superhuman in a freak lab accident, there is the gleeful re-write of history – where, among other things, America has not only emerged victorious in the infamous Vietnam conflict but Richard Nixon is still 'serving' as U.S. President in 1985!) with an oppressive noir mood (in which the volatile, cynical Rorschach operates – traded in the climax for an equally forbidding icy wasteland). Also notable is its expert use of music (bafflingly criticized by some) highlighting giants in the field such as Bob Dylan, Simon & Garfunkel, The Jimi Hendrix Experience and Leonard Cohen and the intricate but admirably fluid editing wherein, at various points, an incident recalls some past event of particular import. Though, at first, I felt this was going to be undercast, most of the actors involved (many of them new faces to me) acquitted themselves well enough under the circumstances – including Malin Akerman as the sensuous Silk Spectre II and Matthew Goode as the deceptively anodyne Adrian Veidt aka Ozymandias (who seem to have received the lion's share of the flak in this regard). That said, another aspect which was not properly defined here for the uninformed is the individual quality of each 'superhero' (for instance, the Jeffrey Dean Morgan character known as ""The Comedian"" is quite the antithesis to what is expected of one, even if only Billy Crudup's Dr. Manhattan – nobly bearing the potential hilarity of his naked blue appearance[!] – is really prodigious in the normal sense). A dense, dazzling and surprisingly satisfactory effort, then, but one that actually leaves the viewer asking for morewhich is why I took the, for me, incongruous plunge of getting hold of an even longer version.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Favourite movie, ever.","I was not a Watchmen fan heading into the theater, but I sure as hell was one leaving. Prior to Watchmen, the recent remake of Casino Royale. If you enjoyed that one a few years back, this is definitely a more over the top, yet maturer type of movie.If you are hoping that this is going to be another huge superhero hit like Spider-Man 2 or The Dark Knight, you are mistaken. Watchmen barely qualifies as a superhero movie. The movie does not revolve around a single antagonist like other superhero movies. In this movie, bad guys get pounded senseless, regardless of their physique.The plot is very well thought out, but the issue was filming it. Because all of the heroes had to have their origins covered in flashbacks. And this is where Zack Snyder's genius comes in. He followed the graphic novel almost exactly. This could have been done very badly, but somehow he was able to make the flashbacks go nearly unnoticed, record being 4 in one scene.The sound effects were amazing, with a solid track list featuring ""My Chemical Romance."" The blood splatters and bone crushing fist fights were heard quite distinctly, adding some flare to the brutal violence.Overall, I wouldn't say it completely trumped so of my old favorites in every way, but did give a solid thrill, and raised questions about the potential psychological issues of a hypothetically real superhero.If I have one complaint, its that Watchmen wasn't made to have a sequel.10/10- Incredible.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Generally faithful adaptation brought down by a few flaws,"Watchmen is, for the most part, a very good film. It examines many different ideologies and allows the viewer to question them self over what is 'right' or whether it is even possible to qualify what 'right' means.The plot is about a group of vigilantes who, following an investigation into the death of an old partner, uncover a shocking and morally questionable conspiracy.A number of different and fascinating characters are presented, each with a different view of the world. This brings up a slew of moral possibilities for the viewer to consider. The film is a welcome break from the 'junk food' cinema that seems to dominate the multiplexes.That said, the film is plagued with a few problems that prevent it from being the masterpiece the comic was. The main flaw is the loss of ambiguity of the ending. In the comic, the reader has no idea what happens after the final panel. This is done so that we can decide for ourselves what we want to happen, leaving it to us to decide what we think is morally right given the situation. The film however, leans much more in favor of one character, almost forcing it on the viewer that this character's world-view is the correct one. This is presumptuous on the part of the scriptwriters and goes against the core concept of the original work, that being that it is up to all of us to decide what constitutes right and wrong.Apart from that, there are some smaller flaws such as the pacing, the soundtrack and some of the acting (though most of the actors do a fantastic job). These can be overlooked fairly easily though, leaving the one main problem.All in all, Watchmen is a better film than most others out there now. It is an intellectual work with great atmosphere and some superb acting. Well worth your time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Character study, but not action-packed","It's a cliché, but: the book was better. Even with a length of 160 minutes, the movie is just too short to explain the whole story. The result is a movie that confuses you a lot.And there's a lot of story: the movie takes place in an alternate 1985, where masked loonies walk the streets, beating up evildoers, but are now outlawed, so they've retired. America won Vietnam, Nixon is still in the White House and the Cold War is about the get hot, with America and Russia both keen to start WWIII. Luckily America has Dr.Manhattan, who keeps the Russians calm. The story focuses on a few superheroes, and this is where it shines: the characters are never one-dimensional but always very complex in its character studies. These heroes all have their problems.While most of the actors are not well known, they are all very good, with the exception of Matthew Goode (Adrian Veidt) who didn't convince me (he seems a little too young). Billy Crudup stands out, it's a difficult job playing this godlike character who shows almost no emotion.I'd say the movie has a slight marketing problem: the trailer makes it look like an other action-packed superhero movie, which will disappoint some people. It starts off as a whodunit, but it soon focuses in on the characters, leaving the plot hanging until the end.So did I like it? Weeeeeeeell, yes. Having read the book some times, I'm a little annoyed by things that have been left out, changed, etc. but it was certainly not a bad movie. Not even a mediocre one. They even had the balls (pun intended) to show Dr.Manhattan in all his naked glory, which I didn't expect. I applaud the fact that we can now have a Hollywood blockbuster that for once isn't afraid to show you male nudity. We all know what it looks like, so what's the problem? What I didn't like is the morphing effect on Rorschachs mask, which is kinda nice, but illogical since he is just a man.My last advice: don't go see this for the action, but for its interesting characters. And if you liked it, check out the comic book.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Never Seen any movie so Boring and so BAD MADE,"I read most of the comments made by other Ppl and i am really wondering if they actually saw the movie or just that was made by the same ppl as 300.Most of this kind of movies like 300, Sin City had a little action at least a plot some intrigue and then a final glorious or not. The way the movie was has is special touch, a new kind of touch thats why lots of ppl like them.Now lets talk about Watchmen. First (and i mean the first 2 h and 20 min) the characters presentation. I mean who pays to watch what the characters eat drink go to the toilet for the first 30 years of their lives?. After this introduction the last 15 min was the intrigue and the final(nice one but damn i got so bored that i didn't really matter).So lets say thing that sucked in this movie(all actually but lets specify).First the characters. Tell me how a human(not super Human) a regular one can punch through a wall. And after that get smacked to 3 tables a bar and still able to get up(the main idea of the film was that super heroes are ppl actually). At least other SH movie got some explanation about how they got they're powers.Second the costumes. Well lets say that a regular Halloween party has better costumes than this movie. I think they just wanted to make a movie and they got no idea what to put in it.Third the sex scenes. Damn i seen better porn in a 100$ budget film.Fourth no distinctive ability's. Everyone does the same thing. Punc and KickSo in conclusion if you have trouble slipping Rent it. It will put you to sleep 100%.

A Nutshell Review: Watchmen,"It begins with the murder of The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a superhero once engaged by the government for its missions, and one of two which is sanctioned by the government. As part of the Minutemen, and then later the Watchmen group, we learn of The Comedian's backstory through a series of flashbacks with the members of his team, and we learn he isn't exactly the usual friendly neighbourhood type nor Mr Popular. He comes complete with plenty of skeletons in the closet, and with an extremely damaged persona made worse from the ghosts of war. He continues to do what he does because he can, which will make any human rights activist seethe with rage.Investigating the murder because he is certain that it leads to a bigger conspiracy of a hired killer engaged to bump off ex-superheroes, Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) takes it upon himself to work outside the system as an outlawed masked vigilante, and this narrative arc runs like an old-fashioned detective crime noir. Running around warning his ex-team members, we soon get introduced to all the other characters, like Dan Dreiberg the Night Owl II (Patrick Wilson), Adrian Veidt's Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), touted as one of the greatest brains and now turned into a successful businessman, who's in pursuit of renewable energy which he deems will turn back the doomsday clock because of his belief that man goes to war over finite resources, Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman) whose mother was part of the Minutemen with The Comedian, and the only super-powered being Dr Manhattan (Billy Crudup), whose allegiance with the USA staves off any potential pre-emptive aggression by the USSR. Quite a list of actors here and it's a smart move in casting a relatively none-too- A-list cast so that none would chew up the screen at the expense of another character or the plot.Snyder knows how to play up his strengths, since the movie's intelligence gets handed to him on a silver platter. What was once deem ""unfilmmable"" by directors who entered and left the project like through revolving doors, it's no surprise that the studios had turned to the man who faithfully adapted in visual terms, Frank Miller's graphic novel 300. I suppose it's a bit of a no-brainer here to again try and visually adapt a graphic novel, and an Alan Moore masterpiece at that, by sticking true to its form from the comic panels. This of course would garner Snyder plenty of flak for doing what he does best again, leaving some unimpressed by reasoning it doesn't take a genius to do just that, but seriously, who has the balls to stamp their own mark on the story and characters, other than to put in some minor tweaks for the modern audience? However Snyders shortcomings come in the form of the lengthy narratives found in the graphic novel, especially toward the second half of the film, and that between Dr Manhattan and Silk Spectre II, which he failed in bringing out the dramatic qualities in character realization and affirmation, and the only response to being like a deer caught in the headlights, Is to throw in more CG unfortunately.Action wise, the film medium allows for Snyder to connect the dots and interpret what happens between comic book panels. Granted the action sequences are few and far between, but Watchmen is never about superheroes busting balls. But when they do, it's no holds barred, and although the trailer seem to suggest plenty of slow-motion, the actual film is anything but. Some of the best set action pieces involve both Night Owl II and Silk Spectre II when they team up to reminisce the days of old. The action sequences here are well filmed, without those quick cut edits or too close a quarter that everything mixes together in a dizzy spin and you can't see anything. In a cinema hall with great sound system, you get to feel every whack and punch the character throws, with the bass reverberating right through to your heart.Now for the gripes. Unless you're really paying attention and can lip read, some of the dialogue may just fly past you so quickly, that you'll go ""huh?"". And that lengthy chit-chat that Dr. Manhattan has with the Silk Spectre II would test your patience a little, despite some graphical effects being overdone in attempting to distract you for a bit from the bore. I suppose that's one of the difficulties faced, in trying to summarize lengthy text from the book into a visual medium - how do you do so without putting your audience to sleep, and yet crucial enough to have to be included somehow? I guess Snyder had yet to find that perfect balance there. Also, while it was a careful selection of songs from the 80s era for the soundtrack, Snyder shows he's no Tarantino in having a ear for great music, and some of the tunes did feel a little out of place. I did like the insertion of Simon and Garfunkel's Sounds of Silence though during a funeral scene. It worked perfectly and gave a very surreal feel to it all.Watch the Watchmen if you'd like a quick peek and introduction to the complexity and sheer genius of an Alan Moore story, coupled with visuals that pop right out of the graphic novel. With a little tweaks made to the story, purists may cry foul at such a blasphemous attempt. But if you take a look at the bigger picture, and the sacrifices for the objectives that can be achieved (just like how it plays out in the story) it just might win new fans over, and to pick up the source graphic novel. To that, I'd say this comes in recommended, though no thanks to additional edits made in order to cater to the teenage crowd here whom I suspect would be restless if approaching this film equating Snyder to 300.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
I watched the WATCHMEN and was entertained.,"This is the best movie of 2009. It is right up there with Sin City(2005), and 300(2007). It really captures almost everything we enjoyed about the graphic novel. There where some changes, I'm not gonna say what they are. But the changes are not to big, other then that it stays true to the story.Now the roles of Nite Owl 2(Patrick Wilson), Silk Spectre 2(Malin Ackerman), The Comedian(Jeffrey Dean Morgan), and Dr. Manhattan(Billy Crudup), I believe where pretty easy to cast, not to mention Dr. Manhattan who is pretty much a CGI effect, and Nite Owl 2 looks like Batmans fraternal twin, and Silk Spectra 2 looks like the lovechild of Batman and Electra. But when I saw Jeffrey Dean Morgan in The Comedians outfit, it was like the character just walk off the page.Now the role of Rorschach, the film noir dressed vigilante, wearing a white mask, that has black spots that keep changing shape, was probably the most difficult role to cast, they had to find an actor, who could embody the most popular character of the them all. They needed to find the right actor. And Jackie Earle Haley did it perfectly, when cameras started rolling he wasn't acting like Rorschach, he became Rorschach. Really bringing Rorschach alive on the big screen. Like the way Heath Ledger embodied The Joker in The Dark Knight(2008), Jackie Earle Haley did the same with Rorschach.Watchmen changed the way we view superheros, very well done by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. And the film is perfectly directed by Zack Snyer(300). It also has great acting, and great action. But be warned this is not a movie for kids, in case they have not read the graphic novel. A great movie, you won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Another example that 1:1 adaptations of comic books don't work,"I would love to give ""Watchmen"" a better rating than I did. I really would.All the love for detail, the great casting (except for Matthew Goode whose mumbling clearly betrays portraying the ""smartest man in the world""), you can see how much effort went into the attempt to create an exact adaption of the graphic novel.But that's also the problem I see in this movie. The dialogue seems artificial and campy at times. Some of the best lines, this movie has to offer are in moments when Snyder lets his writers step away from the novel. (""I'm not locked in here with you! You're locked in here with me!"") It was just painful for me to watch the movie constantly returning to the back-story of the characters when I longed for development in the main plot. Even in the end, a secret in one of the character's back-story is revealed, that is of absolutely no interest, because of the main plot's magnitude.As I said: I'd love to rate this one better. Just for the guts to make it. But that would betray the feeling I had when watching the movie an afterwards. And that was mostly boredom.

Watchmen,"Watchmen is a different kind of superhero movie where it appears to exist a superhero killer. It has a bit of everything and although that may seem good, it isn't.

Watchmen is an excellent adaptation!,"This is perhaps the best comic book movie I have ever seen.

Of course you cant capture everything in the novel and some things have changed to fit better in the film.

Remarkable - The first comic adaptation I've see worth its ticket price and then some,"So much has already been posted here, that I will refrain from rehashing the critiques of others. Instead I will simply leave the reader with a single observation that lead me to leave what I consider to be a high score. I will however say that I have not read the comic, and have no doubt that the comic is superior (I've never heard of an adaptation trumping the original).I have seen comparisons to the Dark Knight, but frankly I was not impressed with D.K. and found its attempt to look into the ""soul"" of humanity to be flashy and superficial. Granted it was one of the best attempts yet for a comic book rehash, but I honestly felt that it fell flat.Watchmen, on the other hand, had a far fuller view of the spectrum of humanity, and could more be compared to the first Matrix in its transcendental views. Though the religious/philosophical undertones were not as explicit as in the first Matrix, the first Matrix used these themes as sugar for an otherwise visceral action flick (I'm speaking about time spent pondering the issues, not the depths at which the movie attempted to explore them). The Watchmen did the opposite. The action was fewer and farther between, and often meant to further the character development and commentary of its themes.I am saddened to hear that it did not sweep the box office (as its budget demanded, and the film rightfully deserved). This was a rare success in an industry that has otherwise failed to remake the comic genre into films with substance.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Watchmen is a powerful and deeply intellectual film.,"""Who watches the Watchmen?"" More importantly, who are the Watchmen? Never before has a comic book movie reached this kind of hype featuring characters only revered by its hardcore fan base. The formula for a blockbuster superhero movie is usually concocted with well-known actors playing iconic characters that surpass through different cultural barriers and jolt their popularity beyond the borders of ink and paper from their perspective comic books. With Watchmen, the producers and director are banking on the compelling and intense story from what many consider to be the greatest graphic novel of all time.It's 1985, but not the 1985 most of us love and remember. Watchmen's 1985 looks like a result of Biff stealing Doc Brown's Delorean time machine, only a hundred times worse. The cold war is stronger than ever between the USA and USSR. President Richard Nixon is on his 5th term. And superheroes have been outlawed. The only deterrent to thermonuclear war is a former Watchman who goes by the name Dr. Manhattan. Due to an accident during a physics experiment, Dr. Jon Osterman is now a being of pure energy, capable of manipulating matter to his will. However as both the US and Soviet's stockpile of weapons grows, faith wanes even in Dr. Manhattan's ability to save the world.Although superheroes have been outlawed, another former Watchman named Rorschach plays by his own set of rules. He's investigating the murder of one of his former Watchman partners, and what he uncovers will affect the entire world.Even though many people have never heard of the graphic novel Watchmen, which the movie is based on, it does have a strong and loyal fan base. Unlike films such as The Dark Knight, Superman, and Iron Man, the general public has little to no identity with the Watchmen heroes. The excitement and anticipation levels to see a familiar character come to life are strongly diminished due to the fact that this film is the first time a large percentage of the audience will be exposed to them. Fortunately for Watchmen, it does not rely on the nostalgia of Saturday morning cartoons, lunchboxes, toys or video games. Watchmen's source material is more than enough to elevate it to one of the greatest comic book movies ever made.The Watchmen comic book is more commonly referred to as a graphic novel. The film takes the word ""graphic"" very seriously. The characters may still be running around in costumes, but for most of them, that's where the similarities with the more revered superheroes end. This skewed reality of 1985 does not have any room for sympathetic heroes. Enter Rorschach.Watchmen does a phenomenal job giving depth and development to a large cast of characters, but if you had to pick one to be the center of the story, Rorschach would be it. If it were fictionally possible, Rorschach would be the illegitimate love child of Batman and Danny Bonaduce. And for those of you who are fans of the website IMDb, you'll be in for a shock to see that the actor playing this role, Jackie Earle Haley, is no stranger to playing a ""bad ass"" even when he was twelve years old.Director Zack Snyder, (300), definitely puts his stamp on the film with his intense ""bullet time"" action sequences, and at the same time keeps everything moving at a steady pace so as not to lose the depth of the characters. Far too often with comic book films, the audience is just waiting until the next scene where the hero once again dons his costume. Snyder does a great job keeping all of the non-conflict and background content just as compelling as the high-energy, costume-clad scenes. A prime example of Snyder's detailed storytelling abilities is culminated in one of the most entertaining and useful opening credit sequences in movie history. Not to mention, the film's transitional scenes are paired up with an unorthodox, yet custom fitted soundtrack.The most notable difference between Watchmen and its past competition is that it just feels ""bigger"" than most other comic book films. Not because more money was spent or the special effects were better, but because the threat the heroes are trying to prevent was at one time, very, very real. This film doesn't take place in a fictional city like Gotham or Metropolis. The story of these heroes transcend through multiple countries and decades of world history, all in a faux reality that walks a thin line between fantastic imagination and our worst fears.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
We Watches the Watchman,"The long awaited Graphic Novel is finally here on the big screen. Some might hate it, some might love it. But this one is one not to be miss for all films fans out there. Don't go in and expect a big time Superman or Spider-Man movie because you will only come out with a big disappointment. This is not your average super hero movie. This is about war and the violence we cause. And it's the Watchmen who tries to bring peace by doing justices.It all begins with an awesome fight sequences where the Comicdian gets murdered. Rorschach, a mask vigilant, goes on to investigate the murder. Later, more of them starts to get murdered. Silk Spectre goes to look for Nite Owl because she had an ague with Dr. Manhattan who later got blame for spreading cancer and went exile. Soon Silk Spectre starts and Nite Owl starts to love each other and they team up with Rorschach to find out what's happening.Fans of the comic might be a little disappointed with the film because there are some major changes in the comic and movie. Although even if it doesn't live up to the comic it is still a great Graphic Novel movie to enjoy with some great direction from Zack Snyder and his Slow motion sequences. With the mix of a wonderful soundtrack. And my favorite scene in the whole film is the beginning where the Comicdian gets murdered and they have the song 'Unforgettable' playing in the background.The Characters are all well portrayed by the cast. They're dark, some of them are so called insane, like Rorschach. The comicdian jut enjoy killing everyone. Great job to Billy Crudup who played Dr. Manhattan. The cast are all well picked to portray the roles. Patrick Wilson does look like Dan Dreiberg or Nite Owl.This is a film fans of the comic would enjoy. And after all those legal issue, is this worth the wait? I would say Yes. This is worth the wait. This is worth the watch.

Good movie but overly graphic,I would recommend watching the director's cut (or maybe even the theatrical release though I haven't seen that so not sure what the differences are) and not the ultimate cut which has an almost tangential sub plot/story. The sub plot added in the ultimate cut is okay but doesn't really add much in my opinion.Other than that it was a nice story. The visual appearance was great and so was the acting. But the movie was pretty graphic in a way that wasn't really necessary. Definitely not for young children.Why do they require these reviews to be so long?

Nothing super about Watchmen,"I went into Watchmen with relatively low expectations. I never bothered to see 300, and I was certain this would be yet another in a line of poorly made ""style over substance"" films in which there would be more effort put into the dissociative CGI/video-game effects than any real character development or plot.What I didn't expect is to find this film to be so incredibly mundane, tedious, and flat-out dull that it would become yawningly hard to watch altogether.""Who cares?"" and ""Why now?"" were the two big questions I began asking myself before finally drifting off and wondering to myself why they can't make ""good"" comic book movies anymore like Tim Burton's Batman or Paul Verhoeven's RoboCop. Heck, even Bryan Singer's X-Men was pretty good (which is interesting, being that one of the many screenwriters of this soporific mess also wrote X-Men).What I found so fun and truly innovative about Robert Rodriguez's superlative adaptation of Sin City was that he was able to accomplish all three goals of a film of this nature: 1) He kept the adaptation relatively close to the urtext, 2) He made something that was stylish, fun, a little kitschy, and still made something worth watching with a good deal of substance, 3) Most importantly, he made a real, true-blue, well-crafted film that couldn't have been made any better whether it was based on another text or not.Watchmen failed horribly in all of these regards.I'm not going to go into too much detail here, because I really stopped paying attention after a while, but we're basically left with absolutely nothing new, not an original moment, line of dialogue, or plot line, and very worst of all, none of the characters seemed to be superheroes at all. They just all seemed to be relatively fast and good at karate, I suppose. One character, played by the absolutely terrific actor Jackie Earle Haley (who, like so many of the other young, brilliant actors along this train wreck such as Billy Crudup and Patrick Wilson, seemed to be lost in a lingering soap opera for two hours) literally only had the ""power"" of having some kind of cloth-mask whose face morphs to different kinds of polygons or something. That's not ""super,"" it's just annoying.Yawn.The only character who had any actual discernible powers (even the so-called ""smartest person in the world""--the one character whose ""superpower"" was actually discussed--didn't seem all that ""super"") was Billy Crudup's absurdly omnipotent Dr. Manhattan who was soooo super that he could do everything and anything--at least in the extremely limited imagination of the writers and director--and thus was rendered equally boring because there was never any sense of risk or tension with this character.I understand that the movie and the graphic novel are supposed to be about the more existential and ""realistic""/psychological realms of the superhero archetype, but even this supposed ""postmodern"" angle on the superhero trope has been done to death by countless movies and books over the last few years, and much better, too (usually funny, light-hearted fare such as the ambrosial The Incredibles or even the slightly less well-crafted Mystery Men).Clearly, as is often the case with ""movies"" of this nature or as with sports and other ""soap operas for men"" such as professional wrestling, fans have a taste for this kind of thing that blinds them to anything else other than the fact that they're watching crap. As with people who can't get enough of Star Wars, it comes down to the fact that they're watching their dreams come alive on screen, and whether it's good or bad, they could care less...... kinda like me when I watch drivel like Watchmen. No wonder it's doing so poorly. Hopefully the Hollywood brass will finally take a hint and realize Zack Snyder needs to go where he belongs: making snazzy commercials or maybe a show on Showtime or something.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Justice is coming to all of us, no matter what we do...","For such a devoted fan of the original comic book as myself, there is simply no word to describe the feeling of excitement that you get when everything you have ever known and loved about the legendary graphic novel comes to life on the silver-screen! It is difficult to compact 12 issues into a single 2 and a half hour movie without jeopardizing the integrity of the story, but Zack Snyder has managed to hit it right where it counts, and make it count! Where to begin? This movie merits so much in terms of the quality of acting, set design, visual effects, and writing. For starters, the acting was overall top-notch and superbly done. Jeff Dean Morgan and Patrick Wilson pulled off their characters of The Comedian and Nite Owl II perfectly and precisely to the book. Billy Crudup delivers a superb performance as the angelic yet apathetic Dr. Manhattan. And Matthew Goode does a surprisingly decent job as Veidt.But all of them pale in the shadow of the incredible job of playing Rorschach done by Jackie Earl Haley. His is on a league of his own, equal in power and complexity to a similar role performed by the late Heath Ledger almost a year ago. I know it is not within the Academy's usual behavior to recognize comic book movies, the painful lesson learned from The Dark Knight's performance at this years Academy Awards. But know this: such a spectacular yet chilling role as this deserves only the best in recognition. The highlight? The famous opening monologue that first introduces us to this unique character: ""And all the whores and the politicians will look up and shout SAVE US! And I'll look down and whisper NO"".Some of the supporting cast are also noteworthy, in particular, the roles played by Stephen McHattie and Matt Frewer, as the first Nite Owl and Moloch respectively. All-in-all, a very good job well done on acting.The visuals are impressive to say the least, with Zack Snyder's realization of a dystopian New York City taken directly from the pages of the comic book. Everything is there, from the Gunga Diner to the Bernies' newspaper stand, to the infamous ""WHO WATCHES THE WATCHMEN?"" graffiti. A few of the designs from the comic book, most notably Nite Owl II's costume and Dr. Manhattan's martian palace, have been redesigned and enhanced for more effect in the process of translating page onto the bigscreen. And while Zack does indeed use a lot of slo-mo, he does not overdo it the way he did in ""300"", and does put it to good use, most notably, in the amazing montage of opening credits that introduces us to this unique world of an Orwellian 1985.Overall, ""Watchmen"" is a fitting and very faithful adaptation of what is rightly ""the most celebrated graphic novel of all time"". My only remote complaint would be the choice of soundtrack cover in two scenes, but otherwise, Tyler Bates delivers a top-notch original score. For being only 2 and a half hours, this movie has just about managed to convey most of what the graphic novel is all about: a deep and multi-layered story that seeks to question what indeed is the role of the hero in a decadent American society. That said, I simply cannot wait for the extended 3 hour cut! To conclude, go watch the Watchmen! Graphic novel devotee or new to the series, prepare to have your mind blown away by a story that delves deeper in the horrors and ugliness of the human mind then any typical superhero movie would've dared to go.

A Masterpiece Misunderstood,"This is the movie that made me realize that regardless of how much you stress your opinion about something on other people, and whatever fancy words or metaphors you use, whether they will share your opinion about said thing depends entirely upon them: their preferences, personality, and intelligence.Watchmen is like Fight Club, Memento, the recent District 9, and 2001. You either think it's weird, boring, or disappointing and hate it. Or you find it fascinating, ingenious, and extremely misunderstood.I fell into the latter category. I didn't think much of it the first time I saw it, but the second time, when I watched it with my brother who explained to me some of its many allusions and metaphors, I was speechless.The image of the blood drop falling on the Comedian's badge suddenly became my favorite image from any movie. Rorshach's death now makes me cry like a baby and Dr. Manhattan's speech on Mars about miracles is the most brilliant thing I've heard in a film, ever.Yes, Watchmen is the best movie I've ever seen, but it's also proof that no movie, regardless of how incredible you find it to be, will ever be able to please everybody.

Yes, the visual effects are good and yes, the cinematography is... well, good. But so what. The acting was pitiful, the costumes were hokey, the fight scenes were contrived, and there seemed to be violence for the sake of violence. The bottom line is that there isn't a good story and certainly not a compelling message that'll leave audiences with a reason to see the movie again.

Ultimate Cinematic Experience = 14/15,"Watchmen is a film I believe has been given a hard time by a lot of mainstream American critics, while common viewers seem to be really divided, about the film's quality. But as far as I am concerned, this is an amazing film; not only personally, but also for objective reasons.What most people can agree with is that the characters are magnificent, which I completely agree. Everybody in this film is simply magnificent; their complexities and views are amazing, and very engaging. Nevertheless I believe Malin Akerman's acting abilities are not the best, then again her character is the most bland in the graphic novel, so it is not entirely her fault.The aesthetic look of the film is also amazing it looks very gritty and somewhat disgusting, but also stylish and colourful. A common complaint about the film, is that the imagery has no symbolic meaning. This complaint is pointless; the imagery is there to look good, while the story of the film, is what holds all the intellectual importance.People also complain that the film, is not focused and that it is far too long. I will agree that there are times in the film, where it does feel a little unfocused, but not enough to distract you from the film. And the complaint that the film is ""too"" long, just makes the critics sound like little children. The movie is long, but it is never boring, because there is always something smart, important, or just cool being shown.The story of the film is great, mainly because of the amazing way the characters portray the themes of morality, human nature, vigilante justice, etc.In conclusion this is a great film and people who dislike it, are most likely people with little interest in out-of-this-world aesthetic look, complex plots, and the exploration of themes through complex characters.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Could not have been done better.,"When I read that Zack Snyder was to take on Watchmen I rolled my eyes. I mean, sure, he did a great job with 300, but that book lent itself to film like a cheap hooker to a wealthy jon; it was cinematic before cinema even touched it.The Watchmen graphic novel is not cinematic. Even though it is composed of images that could be shot with a camera, it's slow and deliberate and rebels against any notion of shortening or getting to the point with pith. Alan Moore would hate you for even asking... and so does his book. While modern editors would call this a weakness to any story, those of us who've read Watchmen know it is an honest strength.So how could a beast like that be adapted to film and call itself a Comicbook Movie, and sit beside others like Iron Man and X-Men and Fantastic Bore... And how could Mr. Snyder's experience on 300 and Dawn of the Dead possibly prepare him for something like this? Well, how could Peter Jackson come off Heavenly Creatures and The Frighteners and make Lord of the Rings, my all-time favorite book and film (they're all one, don't ya know ;^)). It's just not possible! But it happened.And it happened here, too. Zack Snyder rose above merely making excellent films and made something that shouldn't have been possible. Watchmen is slow and deliberate and utterly dripping with potency. It retains the pacing, style and quality of the Alan Moore book, and does it all in 162 minutes.Henceforward this weird creep shall sit high and proud on my short list of favorite directors whose movies I'll always see opening week.

I wasn't a fan or even for that matter aware of the comic book that this is based on. Even so I still found this to be pretty interesting and enjoyable. One thing about this director who also made 300 is that he is pretty relentless and politically incorrect which I find to be very refreshing.Its maybe a touch longer than I would have liked but all in all I can't complain it was probably one of the 10 best of this year, at least thus far.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"great and underrated ""superhero"" movie","I admit it, I don't like comic book movies, in fact, I've hated them for many years now and I agree with the great Scorsese, comic book movies are NOT cinema, today the limit has been crossed, everything has worsened, the quality is now just a mirage, but every now and then there are exceptions and Watchmen is one of these exceptions.I also admit that I'm not a fan of Snyder, he made more bad movies than good ones, but with Watchmen he was really good and made one of the few high-level cinecomics, ok I don't know the comic on which the film is based so I can't judge, but as a film in itself Watchmen is really a fascinating, intelligent, tragic and brutal film, a film that tells the degradation of modern society and the increase in violence and indifference in big cities, the film is from 2009 and takes place in an alternative 1985, but if you watch it today, you realize, unfortunately, that this film is really very current, especially the horrible American society (thank God I'm Italian, but my country is also getting worse) based more and more on hatred, delinquency and arrogance.Snyder's direction, usually too chaotic, works 100% in this film, with beautiful shots and a rotten and dark photography, the cast is perfect above all the very good Jeffrey Dean Morgna, future Negan, and here in the role of the comical, ruthless and sadistic vigilante and Jackie Earl Haley, future new Freddy Krueger of the excellent and underrated remake of Nightmare on Elm Street, in the role of the rude, but fair Rorsach, a character now truly iconic.It's really a shame that this film didn't have the success it deserved and that today crap like the various Avengers or Justice League are popular, completely empty and stupid films, Watchmen is a truly auteur film that deserves to be rediscovered.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
It came out too early.,"Watchmen is an incredible example of how grounded and dark comic book adaptations can be so good. But the majority of the public back in 2009 wasn't really interested in such movies as compared to now. Owing to its underwhelming performance we most probably will never get a sequel which a shame. Now, the story is really grounded and dark, everyone is perfectly fit in their roles and Rorschach's character was just amazing.

"Watchmen finally makes it to the big screen, but was it what the fans were hoping for?","By now pretty much everyone knows the story of Watchmen and also the story behind the making of this film, so I feel no need to retread old ground, what is most important here is whether or not the film was a good film. Sad to say that while Watchmen started out with a ton of promise, towards the middle half of the film it begins to fizzle out and become a film full of some simply put obscure artistic choices.Watchmen, which was directed by Zack Snyder, is first and foremost a well made film, there is no denying that, but where the film finds its problems is in the odd artistic choices made. The film began with an uber serious tone in which I was digging, but towards the middle of the film it began to become almost an obscure comedy that just made no sense with the tone in which they had established so early on in the film. For this reason alone, Watchmen never seemed to recover for me. Even still with this nitpick I found a lot to enjoy with the film.It was as I said well done as a whole, where at certain spots the cinematography and production design stole the show. As well the heavy thematic material of the graphic novel is still as relevant in its film counterpart as it was on the page. So what's the final verdict?Watchmen overall is an entertaining film that is worth seeing, but was short of true superhero film greatness due to some just obscure artistic choices.I give Watchmen a slightly disappointing 7 out of 10!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Clock-Watching,"Watchmen falls into a time-honoured trap of comic adaptations: spending a long time on back-stories that really only add to the film's girth, rather than give it any dramatic bite.It feels like the makers were trying to please too many people. The back-stories were presumably for viewers who had not read the comics - but perhaps also for those who had enjoyed the source material and would have complained about missing characters, plot elements, etc. Given the unavoidable omissions, the catcalls are bound to come anyway.So Watchmen waddles its way through almost three hours, failing to ramp up the tension due to its plethora of characters and multiple flashbacks. Barely credibly, there are also two even longer ""director's cuts"". Good luck to those who have so much spare time on their hands.This writer would have preferred a shorter, snappier film which binned the back-stories and focused on one or two characters. It might not have been faithful to the comic - but as its writer, Alan Moore, despises all film adaptations of his work, what was the point in attempting a reverent homage when a creative desecration could have been so much more enjoyable?",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
The kind of Storytelling DC need to compete with Marvel,"Watching this film almost 10 years after it was released is still as much fun as watching it when it came out.

Unlike Batman and Superman and the other members of the Justice league these characters where made for a strictly dark world where the lines between good and evil are never clear and always blurred.

Completely Entertaining and Top Notch Acting.,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, but I have to agree with several other reviewers, that I think we could have done without Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah' during a great love scene. It just didn't fit where it was placed, nor the tone of the film whatsoever. It should have just been left out completely. There's enough songs in this movie, and it definitely didn't need that one.Anyway, I'm really glad that Zack Snyder didn't hold back on some of the gore graphics or adult scenes. This movie could have been 4 hours long, maybe done in two parts, and I don't think anybody would have complained.Especially as the years go by, the appreciation for films seems to get better with age, and that's what we're seeing here. Fleshed out characters, following a great storyline, and seeing some great acting only makes you wanting more. Zach really accomplished quite a bit to make this fantastic graphic novel into a fine movie. Not easy to do these days.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Rating: B,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)First of all, this review is based on the theatrical version of Watchmen. Usually, Director's Cuts or Ultimate Editions are not preferred over the original release. Few films benefit from them, and most are simply an extended cut with a bunch of deleted scenes. It's only fair and rational that a reviewer watches the version which the whole world saw at the theaters at the respective time. With that said, despite knowing the story of the source material, I never indeed read it. Having in mind that most of the ""hate"" that this Zack Snyder's movie received is from comic-book purists (basically, every book/comic/game/whatever-lover who defends that any cinematic adaptations of any of these sources MUST be 100% the same, with no modifications whatsoever), I'm certain an unbiased perspective is the way to go.And overall, this is a good feature. Watchmen isn't just another CBM (comic-book movie). It doesn't just follow one hero vs. one villain. It's a whole world (in today's standards, it's really a cinematic universe) of ""superheroes"" meant to be explored in fine detail (hence the release of a TV show today... reviewing that later). It's an extremely complex world that needs to be thoroughly explained in order to deeply understand how it works, and what's everyone's role in it. This is the film's main problem: it struggles to juggle all of its different storylines and distinct characters. Even with 163min of runtime, it's impossible to squeeze in all of the necessary information.So, as expected, Snyder and his team of screenwriters had to simplify, shorten, or even wholly dismiss some story elements that would only stretch the runtime to an unfathomable length. Some of the adaptations work brilliantly, but some fail to give a character its importance or offer no interest to a subplot. However, it's still easy to understand everything, and how the ending is going to unravel, which leads me to my second issue with the movie: its final act's heavy exposition.Like I wrote above, there is a lot of information to deliver. What Snyder did very well was to tell most of it through flashbacks or captivating conversations, but in the final act, where everything was self-explanatory and in no need of more exposition, there is an excess of redundant dialogue that doesn't really add anything relevant. What the characters are saying is significant, yes, but we, as the audience, already know all of that way before the film's climax. It's ironic how they make a joke about villains telling their masterplan to the hero and how this villain isn't dumb enough to do it, but then proceed to carefully explain everything (that we know already) through exposition.Sincerely, these are the major problems that I have with the movie. However, I love so much about everything else. From the appropriated and fun soundtracks to the beautiful production design, Zack Snyder and his crew really do a fantastic work technically. Snyder's style captures Watchmen's world perfectly. It's one of those films that carry a ""feel"" due to its stylish cinematography. I love how little CGI is actually applied (I'm obviously ignoring the big blue guy), and the abundance of practical effects and real sets that are used. The action sequences look spectacular, way better than a lot of blockbusters nowadays (10 years later!).Despite the terrific technical achievements, my main compliment is actually connected to my number one problem. Even though the storylines are incredibly hard to balance, characters like Rorschach, Nite Owl, Silk Spectre, and The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) have extraordinarily captivating and entertaining stories. There might be a few missteps here and there, but Snyder made ONE movie from a material that's worth a whole TV show or at least two films. And he delivered a GOOD one! Probably a better job than 80% of the directors working today could ever achieve. Finally, the social commentary is still quite relevant for this new generation, and if the so-called ""source-material-purists"" didn't exist, this movie would be a lot more appreciated.All in all, Watchmen is as good as it could be, having in mind it's just one film with already a long runtime. Its narrative was always going to be extremely difficult to tell in a solid yet compelling manner, and Zack Snyder does struggle with balancing all of the storylines and its characters. However, he and his phenomenal team still delivered a good flick. Technically sublime, with a distinct style, brilliant production design, and gorgeous cinematography. Characters like Rorschach and Nite Owl have amazing moments, filled with excellent action sequences, but also with emotionally powerful scenes. If it could be better? Maybe. If it could be split into two or three movies. As it stands, as one and only film, it's really impressive even with its flaws.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
great sound editing ;),"I'm watching the movie and I think 'darn, this guy (Snyder) really has an eye for translating graphic novels onto the screen ! he just makes the drawn panels come to life... ... and then I think better about it and realize I'm somehow disappointed. What he did with 300 and Watchmen was to film the drawings, frame by frame... guess I wanted more than that. guess I wanted a re-telling of the story, not just a translation... But it works. it catches the essence of the comics. Maybe Moore should watch the movie.

Billed as Unfilmable - The result is Unwatchable,"This film will undoubtedly be a paen to the Watchmen fans out there. If you are not already steeped in the mythology of the Watchmen universe, don't waste your time. This movie is a collection of short films for each of the main characters. These independent films are loosely strung together by a silly plot that is revealed with a sophomoric plot twist in the last 30 minutes.Unless you're a hardcore Watchmen fan, or have three hours to waste avoid this movie like a venereal disease. I stick it through this movie hoping that there would be some point where it became bearable. By the last 30 minutes I was jealous of the people who got up and walked out in the first hour.If you are looking for any bit of action, there is scant little of it in this film. The action stops and starts intermittent. When there is action it tends to be violent and cruel. Its like the imaginings of a nascent sociopath.The dramatic scenes don't offer much more to hope for. The dialog is overwrought, over thought, and overacted. Mostly its just BORING. Even the sex scenes are BORING.

The Ultimate Cut is epic,"Even if the move isn't as trailblazing as the graphic novel, it's an awesome work of (anti-)superhero-movie offering a lot more of profundity than most of the hero-franchise are able to.Moreover, its style, screenplay and the various pieces add up to a unique comic-based movie set in a fascinating dystopia you will get lost in while watching.Of course there is more action in the movie than in the novel, but before watching you should be aware that's a hollywood movie (if it wasn't, there would be less budget and a worse movie I guess) and therefore there are typical scenes. Nevertheless it offers you a bunch of extraordinary scenes you won't forget.To be honest: the ultimate cut is still a lot better than the originally aired movie from 2009 because it includes more novel-based scenes, the comic tales of the black freighter and more passion and profundity.This version is almost a masterpiece and - no doubt - one of the best movies with masked protagonists.

Underrated Gem depicts Gritty Alternate Universe,"Based on the fantastic graphic novel by Alan Moore, this film is not a typical DC franchise-milker. There are a LOT of serious themes here, and they deliberately conflict with each other. One might call this ""The Thinking Man's Justice League"" -- but even that doesn't capture the scope of this film. The story, acting, and soundtrack are all excellent, and I'm sure Zack Snyder gets a lot of credit. The alternate reality allows for some thoughtful changes to Earth's history, but unfortunately makes the film less gripping, arguably more of an academic exercise. The lovely Malin Akerman's character is arguably the emotional centerpoint of the film; she gives the audience something to care about, which helps greatly.How many films combine action, mystery, Science Fiction, moral dilemmas, and pleasant sex scenes with a cool retro vibe?I rate this as eight-and-a-half (8.5) stars, with a half-star penalty for distracting amounts of gore (some was appropriate, but ...).",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Less is Moore,"Alan Moore's beef with Hollywood is that it's a crudifying monster  its arms entering the spectator's mind through the eyes and once inserted, frenzied and aimless, pulping the grey matter contents into a kind of wit resistant batter which is no more capable of processing the dense psychological and social preoccupations of his work than wood can hope to ferry electricity.For Moore, willfully ignorant in an effort to protect his own authorship, cinema just isn't up to it. The detail of each panel within the humble comic book is a gallery of ideas and story specific detail that you, yes YOU the grateful reader, pore over at your leisure, like the fine art connoisseur plotting their time through a superb exhibition and breathing in each piece in turn. This notion that film, by its very nature, is reductive in translation and confected on delivery, has lead the co-author of Watchmen to suggest that his 1986 graphic novel was ""unfilmable"". For the record, that's senseless toss but this adaptation isn't going to change his mind. It's not the mode of translation that's at fault  film is a perfectly viable tool for the job, it's the way that tool has been used.Watchmen is a fascinating view because it vividly illustrates several of the problems transferring material between two visual art forms that rely on significantly different patterns of consumption and interpretation to work.Dave Gibbons, who illustrated the 12-part series on which this is based, was, unlike Moore, happy to be credited and that's hardly surprising because Zack Snyder has used his art work like a storyboard, compensating for the rapidity of the moving image where appropriate, with fits of slow motion, designed to recall the experience of forensically eyeballing those all important panels. It is, superficially at least, a good technique, reverent to the original and designed to fluff the fanboys who will have envisioned it thus and will be in a furious masturbatory frisson as a result. Were this the only barometer, Watchmen would be a qualified success but its problems are manifest in those areas that required an artist rather than the fan at the helm  a director rather than a acolyte - narrative, backstory, tone; the elements of the graphic novel that, somewhat counter intuitively, may have benefited from a less straitjacketed approach.Watchmen the graphic novel acknowledges the limitations of the medium, whether it knows it or not, by fortifying each part with written extracts from various fictional sources  a former super heroes autobiography, a police report, a magazine article  all of which add texture to the characterization and flesh out the stories alternative timeline. Inevitably the three act Hollywood picture isn't the easiest framework within which to add these deets, so what to do? Émigré directors of the 30s and 40s working in Hollywood (and a few of the natives), overcame these sorts of problems by investing scenes with expressionistic composition and shadow, which married with incisive, witty dialogue, hinted at what couldn't be shown or seen, and consequently your imagination became the bridge and added the depth. The result? Film Noir  the perfect fusion of artistry and suggestion and some of the finest American films ever made.Snyder knows he has a problem in this respect but sentimentally in thrall to the source, is incapable of making the decisions that might have saved his bacon. It's a matter of hitting the same psychological points in the story but with greater subtlety than a word for word transfer allows. Much of the dialogue is lifted from Moore's script, but what works within the context of the comic book, feels clunky and coarse when it exits the mouths of real human beings. Rorschach is the case in point. On paper he's brooding, introspective and psychotic  on screen he speaks the same words, does the same things but has a pantomime quality that errs toward the ridiculous. Too often, when unable to mark out his roadmap to the story's political and socio-satirical cues, Snyder's instinct is to go for crunching violence and spectacle (as well as adding inches to Doctor Manhattan's flaccid penis not a bad metaphor for his approach), perhaps hoping to overpower the viewer's undernourished cerebellum. He'll say the noise is all on the page of course, and it is, but what felt cutting in the novel's more fully realised world, looks like a blunt instrument on screen. It isn't that you can't film it, you just can't do like this, but it's another case study to add to the files on the issue of how the filmmakers best equipped to replicate the EXPERIENCE of these stories, are seldom the ones who actually have an interest in doing so.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
95% of this movie was unforgettable,"Haven't read the comic but everything about the Watchmen is kickass.

I get it, some people can't sit still for more than 2 hours and need a straightforward plot following the same trite hero's journey. This movie was way too long and way too good.

"When it's good, it's great, when it's bad, it's embarrassing","Bringing Alan Moore's cerebral and sprawling novel to the screen was always going to a near-impossible task. It's very much an anti-superhero story, where the 'heroes' are merciless psychopaths, government weapons of mass destruction, or sexually impotent. Spanning decades and featuring snippets from books, comics and newspaper reports within the world Moore creates, any film adaptation simply could not match the level of details and authenticity of the much-lauded novel. Zack Snyder, a fan of the original, and a director who was just off the back of the surprisingly excellent Dawn of the Dead (2004) and the shouty, crass 300 (2006), puts all of his heart and soul into Watchmen.Using a no-name cast, a convoluted and dangerously slow story, and an adult rating thanks to all those snapped bones and a massive blue willy, it's a wonder this ever got made at all. It was in development hell for years, with names such as Terry Gilliam and Paul Greengrass becoming attached and then quickly detached from the project, and even the nerve-jangling possibility of Arnold Schwarzenegger as the movie's only true superhero was banded around in the mid 1990's. It's almost impossible to think of a more faithful adaptation than Snyder's, often re-creating frames from the comic in the minutest of detail, and even including Tales from the Black Freighter, the comic- within-a-comic from the novel with the voice of Gerard Butler (this is a review of the 215- minute cut, which I feel is the best version out there). Yet, you could still argue that Moore's book is un-filmable.The 1980's, and President Nixon is running his fourth term in office, and superheroes have been outlawed. Ageing government assassin The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a former member of two superhero groups named the Minutemen, is murdered in his home. Vigilante and wanted man Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) investigates the murder, and brings his theory that someone is hunting down retired superheroes to his friend and former partner Dan Dreiberg (Patrick Wilson), formerly known as the White Owl. With the threat of nuclear war with the Soviets becoming frequently more inevitable, heads turn to Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup), a neo-God with the ability to bend matter to his will. But when he learns that he may have given his friends and loved ones cancer, he flees to Mars, leaving the world vulnerable to complete annihilation.The Watchmen world is thick and meaty, re-writing history as if masked heroes and super-villains actually existed. In the film's opening titles, we are treated to an impressive collage of famous historical events, such as the Moon landing, but here it's Dr. Manhattan photographing Neil Armstrong. It's a hell of a lot of back-story to fill in, and the movie spends most of it's time filling in the gaps between the 1940's and the 1980's. Luckily, the characters Alan Moore wrote so beautifully, are fascinating, and the extended segments dedicated to portray their personal evolution are arguably more interesting than the movie's main plot. These are not flawed superheroes like Batman or Wolverine, they are complete f**k-ups, getting sexual stimulation from violence, battering minor offenders to a bloody pulp, or, in Dr. Manhattan's case, literally losing every trace of his humanity.Moore's novel made them a parody of the idea of masked superheroes protecting the weak. The Comedian especially is a piece of work, gleefully frying a Viet Cong with a flame thrower, while a giant Dr. Manhattan stalks the jungle vaporising any enemies in his way, helicopters whizzing by his head while 'Ride of the Valkyries' plays. Like with 300, Snyder way overplays it. The comic itself wasn't exactly subtle, but Watchmen the movie amps everything up to 11, and while this admittedly makes the film more exciting, it makes the themes heavy- handed and sometimes plain laughable. Dreiberg can only get it up for the Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman) after he's murdered some criminals, but when he finally does, Snyder captures it like a soft-core porn movie starring Shannon Tweed, with the cringe-worthy use of Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah' in the background. In fact, the entire soundtrack feels as if it's been picked by some stoner student with Jimi Hendrix posters on his wall.It's no surprise that, after a very successful opening week, Watchmen plummeted once word-of-mouth got around. Audiences drawn in by the possibility of another superhero spectacle were no doubt left baffled by the existential musings of it's characters and the extreme darkness of the film's themes. Perhaps it was what the film deserved, as when it's good, it's the work of a true artist, and when it's bad, it's quite embarrassing. But it's the best that us fans are likely to ever get, and we must be thankful that a director who really knows and loves the source was on board, and insistent that it wasn't destroyed by the studio butchers. Snyder has also rounded up an excellent cast, with Haley and Crudup standing out especially (Akerman suffers from some dodgy delivery occasionally but she sure pulls off that costume). It will continue to divide it's viewers, but it'll be somewhat cherished by it's fans.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Watchmen Explores the Soul and What it means to be a Hero,"Split open the mind of a scientist, add in superhero strength and struggles, set it in a doomsday world, sprinkle with some saucy fan service, shake, and you get ""The Watchmen, based on Alan Moore's mind-blowing graphic novel.The plot is somewhat complex, but in fact, it matters little to this film. This movie is all about characters, culture, and the mood of the film. The story is set in an alternative United States history. It's 1985, and Richard Nixon has been elected to his third term in office.The doomsday clock has been set for five minutes to midnight  midnight being the time when either Russia or the U.S. will launch a deadly atom bomb and the idea of world peace will forever be obliterated.The Watchmen are a group of ""superheroes,"" although none of them (with one exception) have superhuman abilities. The story is laid out in a non-linear fashion: We see the past, then the present, then the more distant past. We find out bits of the story through memories, conversations, and photos on walls.The main conflict is that The Comedian, one of the former Watchmen, has been murdered. Rorschach, our narrator, is convinced that someone is targeting the Watchmen and picking them off, one by one. He sets out to discover who it is and to warn the rest of his former teammates.As usual, the others either mock him or ignore him. While he is trying to solve this mystery, Dr. Manhattan gets accused of causing his former colleagues to get cancer. He chooses to separate himself from the human race and abandon Earth, which leaves the United States feeling defenseless against Russian attack.The Watchmen pose a problem. They don't act or talk like superheroes, but that is the position they were given in society, at least for a time. Now, as retired superheroes, they live like a bunch of cast-off toys. The world has no use for them anymore. None of them seem happy, although a few tell themselves it's better this way.The potential evil of a human soul is fully explored. We see different ones of the Watchmen cheating on spouses, murdering pregnant women, and shooting civilians as a way to calm them down. The most loathed act is done by the murdered Comedian, who tries to rape one of his fellow superhero friends. Are we supposed to like them? Is there a hero in this story at all? Or is the problem the world? In our modern world, with weapons that can cause so much destruction, is it even possible to be a hero? Do the Watchmen do horrible things because they are horrible people or because they live in a horrible world? These are the types of questions this movie presents as we watch the film.The cinematography is a sight to behold. The camera gives equal love to both full-screen panoramic views, such as when Dr. Manhattan sets up his own city on Mars, and the tiniest detail, such as watching a drop of blood fall and spatter the yellow smiley face pin. Yes, the action scenes include lots of slow motion shots (Director Zack Snyder is well known for this after ""300""). The tone is dark and beautiful. The soundtrack reflects the historical time periods shown, featuring artists such as Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin, Simon and Garfunkel, and Jimi Hendrix.The acting is well done, not outstanding, with the exception of Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. He completely steals the show. He is our narrator, so we get to know him the best, and his character is one you won't soon forget. Whereas some of the Watchmen have gone slack or lost their passion for the work, he continues to live life with utter conviction. He never backs down, even up until the end. We might not agree with his actions, but we know what he stands for, which is more than I can say for most of the crew.I would not recommend bringing children or even younger teens to this movie. It includes graphic violence, rape, sex, profanity, and disturbing images.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Well made adaptation,problematic soundtrack","The movie itself is adapted quite well.Only some scenes are changed somewhat.Some scenes are almost shot frame for frame as they appeared in the comic. My only real complaint is the music.The movie would have worked so much better with a symphonic score.Instead Snyder chooses to put pop music in that really has no relevance to the on screen story.That is,aside from the opening credit music,which kind of worked. Hopefully,Snyder makes some changes to the soundtrack when we get the epic director's cut.The movie could be improved if he does. Other than that,the movie is an interesting,well filmed piece of art.I'm definitely interested in seeing the extra footage.And will be waiting patiently for the director's cut.

The absolute greatest superhero/comic/action/Sci-Fi movie ever made.,"From the best sound track, to the spot on casting, brilliant acting, wicked choreography and perfect direction, I can't fault a SINGLE thing about this movie that would make it better.Very rare for this genre, there are no standout performances because the cast so well balanced, I could just rattle off actors who absolutely nailed it, but that would be like just reading the credits in order.I think this is a perfect comic adaption movie because it is such a well written and rounded finite story (thanks to comic writing legend Alan Moore).It succeeds were many fail I feel, because it isn't hampered by the vastness and decades worth of convoluted story lines that weigh down other superhero/comic films.Having it's own separate (though familiar) universe and also being set in a clearly defined historical era/time gives the story/movie a legitimacy almost unparalleled (most notable exceptions Frank Millers- 'Sin City' and '300').THIS is the reason Jack Snyder was given free reign over 'Superman', 'Batman' and the 'Justice League' movies, regardless of how you feel about them, Watchmen is guaranteed to impress.Incidentally this is also in my top 5 favorite movies of all time.

The Violent Gang of Six in vain; and all that...,"'Watchmen' is set in 1985, in a alternative reality where USA and Soviet are on the brink of nuclear-war. Superheroes are outcasts, and vigilante Walter Kovacs alias Rorschach, is investigating the murder of his former colleague Edward Blake alias the Comedian. As he digs deeper into the case, a mysterious plot unravels - now he reconnects with members of his former legion, and starts uncovering a disturbing conspiracy.I was a 'Watchmen' virgin watching this at the cinema. Having heard so much of the enormous popularity (I still believe it was mostly among geeks) of the graphic novel by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, I understood that I (and surprisingly a huge percent of my fellow Norwegian movie-lovers) had missed out on one of many of-its-times cult-literature-works. The novel was supposedly ""unfilmable"" as directors as Terry Gilliam and Paul Greengrass had failed to capture its essence, but director Zack Snyder ('300') did certainly not let anything stand in his way when shooting one of the most ambitious superhero-tales ever written. Snyder lets it all hang out in this, but he's certainly torn between two camps; the ones who know and love the novel, and people like me, Watchmen-virgins.The film tells multiple stories, and tries capturing every emotional, political, and moral complexity in bits and pieces throughout. The six superheroes are interesting and compelling characters; Jackie Earl Haley is Walter Kovacs aka Rorschach, a masked vigilante with a dark past, whose ""do-it-or-drop-it"" encouragement makes him an unstoppable force of righteousness; Patrick Wilson plays Daniel aka Nite Owl II, a man fearing his former alias and who's hiding away his past in the basement, unable and failing to blend into society; Malin Akerman is Laurie Juspeczyk aka Silk Spectre II, a leathery chicksa whose counter-responding to her mother's superhero-days and are conflicted in a difficult relationship with Doctor Jon Osterman aka Doctor Manhattan, played by Billy Crudup, a doctor who accidentally became empowered with otherworldly powers and are awing bleakly at humanity; Matthew Goode plays Adrian Veidt aka Ozymandias, the only former 'Watchmen' who has revealed his identity is a ageless Aryan who's now operating as a global business-man; and there's Edward Blake aka The Comedian, played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan, a psychopath whose humor has a brooding darkness and purpose. All of this characters have a dark edge, and at times they almost look too-hot-to-handle, and with already such layered philosophical dialogs and deepened mythology it comes a bit cooking when Silk Spectre II and Nite Owl II develops an affair that becomes dominating in the second part that appears neither natural, sparkling or vivid, it just becomes a bit annoying. And here Snyder fails to capture the humanity and humorous sexual tension between guys and dolls clothed in spandex, and neither all of the actors achieves to completely fulfill their characters soul (Matthew Goode, Malin Akerman and Patrick Wilson). But this is undoubtedly a gang-of-six full of spectacle and rousing aspects; for example Doctor Manhattan is a sort of anti-superhero, the cirupy piece of glowing CGI works splendidly when alone on Mars trying to seek for a higher ground, and his relationship-troubles with Laurie / Silk S, feels interesting in the film's humanization of the vigilantes; and Rorschach is truly a paranoid superhero-version of Philip Marlowe, wearing the classic coat-and-hat but with a mask full of ever-changing expressions, strolling down the rainy streets with a snarling voice including a under-used narrative, he's tracing down a murder mystery with brilliant determination.Snyder makes it run for 2 hours and 40 minutes, and although I'm sure there's plenty of further details to investigate at a second viewing (for the geeks), it feels a bit long when there's really no climax to appear, and now there's things to love and hate about exactly that - but it surely could have been chopped down, because there's nothing to love about a film feeling like it's never going to end. But herein the long running time there are blasting visuals, the loads of green screen and digital effects are all over the place, but Snyder manages to create a world and vision that's got dark elements of film-noir, science fiction and Armageddon. In Snyder's previous film '300', he kept the story at 1st-grade levels, spoon-feeding the audience with ridiculous voice-overs and one dimensional characters, here he goes the opposite way around. Its bloody seriousness and anti-mainstream heart is way-interesting, but as said I feel it was a novel of its time, and so much of its references and ""oh-so-intelligent"" gibberish becomes, well gibberish, and the storytelling becomes a bit disorderly when the plot starts knotting up, and we're given quirky humor of various success and pop-cultural placings of great music that doesn't necessarily become executed greatly; Bob Dylan's ""The Times They Are A-Changin'"" playing under that nostalgic intro is great, the use of Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"" while Nite Owl and Silk Spectre makes love in a daft craft on the other hand, is simply terrible.In the finale there's a lot that doesn't entirely make sense, but still, there's the bone-crushing violence and grim characters that makes for a interesting watch, and it's full of glowing ambition, and so 'Watchmen' succeeds to make a change in the path of superhero-movies.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
I personally...,...Get mad at people that just crap on movies like this. It may not be your cup of tea but if you are a fan of darker superhero movies and comics and maybe painting the superhero in a more realistic light then this is one of the few movies that would give you what you're looking for. I'll keep it short. It's a good movie no matter what you're looking for as long as you like super heroes (with the exception of the campiness of Batman '69 then you may not enjoy it). To like super heroes and to dump on this movie at the same time is an oxymoron.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Was it great?,"Not really, but it was good and it had a great underlying premise. Do you kill a few to save many...?So I liked the tone of the film, and the cinematography. The visuals were great, but a tad too much on the speed ramping (slow to fast and fast to slow motion) obviously taken after the Matrix, but Snyder does it a bit too much in his films. Less is more.The writing of this was pretty bad, and by bad I mean there was way too much exposition. Each scene was pretty much filled with information introduced in an unnatural way. Too much data that someone wouldn't give unless the writer needs to convey it to an audience, but there are ways of inserting data without being unnatural.But it got better as it went on.Rorschach was the baddest of them all.

Is there a bit of an uneven ending with the antagonist? Yes. However I couldn't help but be satisfied in many parts. While I didn't think that these characters were introduced well initially, pretty much all of their backgrounds ended up being explained and they were original characters that I had never seen or heard of before but I'm happy I saw them on the big screen! I very much enjoyed the style of the movie, as it reminded me of Sin City (2005) with the blood and gore which was awesome in all of the action scenes, plus the well-spoken, beautiful, hot, and sexy Malin Akerman as Laurie Jupiter added a lot of appeal. Dr. Manhattan provided the film with much depth too. With all of those things, the movie ends up delivering!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Do NOT take your children to this movie,"Do NOT take your kids to this movie. There were unsuspecting parents in the audience with 8 to 12 year-old kids.

Of course, reading the disclaimer here would have mentioned it, but 99.9% would just presume they'd have been warned in the advertising. From the theater trailers (knowing nothing of the source material), we went to see it thinking it would be a typical comic-style super hero action movie. It was rather cold and had a convoluted message - which was ts ultimate point, I surmise. If you weren't captivated by the original story source, I think you would find the story to be not that exciting and VERY VERY long.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A Visually Stunning and Thought-Provoking Masterpiece,"Zack Snyder's Watchmen is a bold, ambitious adaptation of Alan Moore's graphic novel, bringing a layered, morally complex world of vigilantes to the screen in a way that is both visually striking and intellectually engaging. While the source material is revered for its deep philosophical themes and deconstruction of superhero tropes, Snyder manages to stay remarkably faithful to its essence while adding his own flair to create a cinematic experience that both captivates and challenges its audience.The film's greatest strength lies in its ability to balance spectacle with substance. The visuals are nothing short of stunning, with the use of color, lighting, and composition echoing the graphic novel's distinctive style. Each shot feels meticulously crafted, whether it's the slow-motion sequences or the hauntingly beautiful opening credits that set the tone for the entire film. The dark, gritty aesthetic of the film immerses viewers in an alternate reality where superheroes are flawed, human, and deeply entangled in political and moral issues.The ensemble cast is fantastic, with standout performances from Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach, whose haunting voice and tortured persona perfectly capture the essence of the character, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who brings a raw, tragic edge to the Comedian. The chemistry between the characters is compelling, especially in the complex dynamics between Dr. Manhattan, Nite Owl, Silk Spectre, and Rorschach. While these heroes are not traditional, their struggles with identity, power, and moral ambiguity make them all the more compelling.The narrative, while dense and at times complicated, successfully tackles themes such as the nature of power, the ethics of heroism, and the consequences of vigilantism. The film asks hard questions, such as whether the ends justify the means, and doesn't shy away from exploring the darker aspects of human nature. This level of depth makes Watchmen a rich, thought-provoking film that doesn't rely on the typical superhero tropes of good vs. Evil.While the film's pacing may not be for everyone-its methodical, sometimes deliberate rhythm-Watchmen ultimately rewards those willing to engage with its philosophical layers and moral questions. The film's exploration of existential dread, power, and accountability within a flawed society feels incredibly timely, making it as relevant today as it was in its original comic book form.Watchmen is not just a superhero film; it is a meditation on heroism, morality, and the human condition. It challenges the conventions of the genre while delivering a visually stunning and intellectually stimulating cinematic experience. This is a movie that stays with you long after the credits roll, asking you to reconsider the idea of what it means to be a hero in a world full of grey areas.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Interesting, funny, politically uncorrect. But it's too much","This is a new History of Cold War through superhero eyes. It's a different America which won the Vietnam War thanks to superheroes. And ""now"", in 1985, Us faces the risk of a total confrontation with Soviet Union. But someone is killing all the Watchmen, the super-humans who defend America and its society. This is the interesting scenario of ""Watchmen"", not only a comic-movie, but a comprehensive reflection on America. To make a movie from the graphic novel ""Watchmen"" is almost impossible. Zack Snider tried, the result is not bad, but not perfect either. Moore, one of the two novelists, boycotted this project. While the plot is developed as a thriller (who want to kill the Watchmen?), the focus shift from one character to an other, each of them reflecting a different philosophy. This is the strength of the movie, but also its foe. In a novel, the authors had all the time and space to develop all their philosophical questions. Which are: when the use of brute force is legitimate? Is man entirely responsible of his actions? Does God exist? If God exists, why he ignores sufferance and considers the complete annihilation of humanity? Is life really a ""miracle""? Is peace a value in itself? Does it justify sacrifices and millions of deaths? In a movie is impossible to reach an answer in 160 minutes. When we leave the theater, we can think: ""it's too much"". And we had no answer as well. The (not so much) happy ending is a great delusion, especially if we compare it to the open ending of the novel. But I don't want to make any spoiler. But there are other strengths in this film: it's fantastically politically uncorrect! And it brakes all the clichés of superhero movies: the Watchmen are not entirely good, they protect society by means of violence, sometimes brutal violence. In superhero movies, usually there no gore and no sex at all. Here we can taste ultra-violence and a lot of sex scenes. Usually in a superhero movie, political debates are off-limits. In Watchmen, politic is the main focus. And we can taste satire against liberals and peace-mongers (and vegetarians) never heard in other commercial movies. This is an act of courage in the era of politically correctness.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"""Why should I save a world I no longer have any stake in?""","You know you're in trouble when one of your biggest selling points is labeling Zack Snyder as a visionary.Surely, quite a few people already know the basic idea behind the 'Watchmen' phenomenon, but for those who don't, allow me to fill you in quickly: It's basically a darker version of 'The Incredibles'. It takes place in 1985, and superheroes used to be all that and a bag of chips, but have since then been outlawed. For the film's opening sequence, we're treated to a beautifully choreographed fight/murder scene of The Comedian (one of the original masked heroes), whom is later shown to be quite a douche bag, which really takes away from the impact of his death. That event leads to another retired hero, Rorschrach, trying to solve his murder, which leads to him uncovering a whole other plot to destroy humanity or some crap like that. Unfortunately, the opening murder is the high point of the film.You know you're in trouble when the best scene in the film is the first one.The acting in this film isn't exactly 'The Dark Knight' caliber, but it's much more preferable to the inaudible shouting of '300'. The performances here are serviceable. Nothing exceptional, but the actors do their jobs well. Patrick Wilson leads the film as Nite Owl. Jackie Earle Hayley also has a major role as Rorschrach, whose face is hidden under a mask for a large portion of the film. Matthew Goode has a smaller, yet equally engaging part, portraying Ozymandias, the world's smartest man (not really sure how that makes him a superhero). We also have a glob of blue C.G.I. pixels, voiced by Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan. Last but not least, newcomer Malin Akerman plays as the obligatory female foil to the cast, although she does so with much more personality than her character was written with.From what I've heard, some 'Watchmen' enthusiasts have been claiming that the graphic novels this film is based off of couldn't be done, or done well at least. As far as I'm concerned, they're yet to be proved wrong. Alan Moore, the writer of the graphic novel series, is notoriously known for not liking what Hollywood has done with any of his other works prior to 'Watchmen', and I quote: ""I'll never watch the f_cking thing"". But I can't really blame him for that, because what we have here is not what he made at all. It lacks the emotional depth, the message, or anything he intended with the graphic novel. Now, having said that, I do think 'Watchmen' works to a certain extent, as it's own film, if you don't really have any connection to the source material, or just don't associate the two with each other. Now, I've only read about half of the original graphic novel, but I'm willing to bet none of them contained an uncomfortably drawn out and oddly boring sex scene. One of the advantages of reading the graphic novel is not having to listen to ""Hallelujah"" by Leonard Cohen while the two lead actors awkwardly hump each other for two minutes.You know you're in trouble when a sex scene with somebody as unbelievably hot as Malin Akerman is boring.Overall, this is not the faithful adaptation the graphic novel deserves, but it's still pretty entertaining. Is this as good as the comic without comparing the two side by side? No, it's not even in the same league. But I have to commend Zack Snyder for reflecting the tonality of the source material, even though he tried to make it his own, which is where the film falls short of being a satisfying experience. It's not a must-see, but it's decent enough to at least give it a try.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
If you did not read the book...you may not enjoy it the way some reviewers seem to enjoy it.,"I saw this on HBO tonight and I think it was long, tedious, and not that exciting. A 3 hour movie really has to keep it moving and keep things interesting if one is to enjoy it...sort of like Avatar did where if didn't feel like 3 hours had gone by. Dr. Manhattan was cardboard and robotic, OK - I get that he's nuclear-powered and all but his acting was dreck. The only character that really ""sold it"" in my opinion was the bad guy...I'm not going to say who since that might spoil it for others who read this and may still have 3 hours of their lives that they don't care about wasting. Oh, and Rorschach and a few smaller characters were OK too, but not ""special"" enough to make the whole movie great. The naked love scenes did not really add to the story, but I guess the teenage boys love those. Since I'm home with a cold and didn't feel like getting up to put in a DVD I was stuck with this, and now I wish I had gotten up and put on a DVD of something else. But I was curious and love action movies, so there you have it.Bottom line - if you're a big fan of graphic novels you may like it. If you like THIS particular graphic novel you may like it. If you are NOT such a fan of graphic novels, you may find it ""nothing special bordering on awful"" like I did. 'Nuff said?",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
the super comic-book movie event exists - and it's a near perfect film,"It was called the classic ""unfilmable"" line, but Alan Moore and David Gibbons' Watchmen was film-able, and oddly enough after over 20 years of directors from Terry Gilliam to Darren Aronofsky to Paul Greengrass taking the possible helm the most commercial choice imaginable, Zack Snyder, made it film-able, and indeed a very, very good movie. How he accomplishes this is fairly straightforward: compress as much as possible of a 12-issue comic book series into a 2 1/2 hour running time, cut off certain pieces of fat (most notably the Black Freighter story which will be on DVD soon anyway as a bonus), and keep the structure and character development and stories 90% of the same. Also, make it about as accessible as possible to a mainstream audience without, possibly, insulting intelligences much.Indeed this is an incredibly faithful adaptation all things considered - ""things"" being the fact that after reading the book, still (and I'll sound cliché like many others) the most compelling and daring and magnum-opus-of-all-time works from Moore and in the medium itself, largely of the details save for a reasonably crucial bit in the climax were left intact. Snyder knew to not get too much in the way of the story and characters would be a wise move, and it is in the sense that if a work is as rich and satirical and dark and violent and sometimes warped sometimes lucid and fairly tragic like the Watchmen it's best not to get in its way as it goes along.For what it's worth, this is the best Watchmen film that we can expect from Zack Snyder, touted as a 'visionary' in the ads based on two good but definitely not great films Dawn of the Dead and 300. Because when he does not let the story well enough alone and puts his ""signature"" directorial touches on the proceedings, which is mostly slow motion, sometimes in annoying quick bursts that don't add anything of worth to the hyper-realism portrayed, it screams *much*! But, again, this thankfully doesn't happen with the kind of regularity and overbearing force of 300, and he can actually direct action and even dramatic tension really forcefully (this may come into fuller light on a repeat viewing or the director's cut). I'd even go as far as to say he's improved as a filmmaker, mounting such an impressive production with a cast of primarily character actors (matter of fact no real BIG stars), by taking the story where it needs to go both for those familiar and/or in love with the book, and for those looking for some solid entertainment.I haven't described the plot yet. Here it is in a sentence, if I can try: it's 1985, Richard Nixon is still president (and Vietnam was a victory), America is at a close possible WW3 scenario with Russia, and superheroes are outlawed - and one of them, the Comedian, has been bumped off possibly, as masked psycho/bad-ass Rorscach thinks, by a killer of superheroes, leading to an investigation by him and other drama unfolding with the actual ""American Superman"" Dr. Manhattan and his sort of love interest Silk Spectre. If that's barely scratching the surface of it all then so be it, since this is even in the framework of the film (and I mean this as a compliment) dense with detail and motivation and dramas of the personal and big-time Earth scale.Since the storytelling itself, with some of the exceptions I mentioned up before (another being a different twist done from the book for Veidt's plan), is solid and cunning and even featuring a more-than decent selection of songs, what about the cast? It's a mixed bag, frankly, but one that is at the least inoffensive and at best truly inspired, if perhaps as givens. Jackie Earl Haley, Billy Crudup and Jeffrey Dean Morgan go totally into their characters of Rorscah, Dr. Manhattan and the Comedian, making us feel for them just as we did in reading the text. Outside of that, for non-readers of the book, they're still fabulous performances, particularly for Crudup's very subtle touches in inflection (perfectly near-noticeable) and Haley as a tortured soul who sees fit to strike fear into anyone that might cut him down just a single peg (and, unlike Bale's Batman, I really believed Haley doing a super grunty voice for his character).If nothing else, the back-stories with Manhattan (Crudup) and Rorscach (a hopeful Oscar nom for Haley), and to a slightly lesser extent Comedian (Morgan), are little masterpiece shorts in the midst of the epic running time, and are supported by these actors bringing their characters full of life and sorrow and so-black-it-stings humor. Goode and Wilson are not quite as good, and Akerman maybe just falls totally flat as perhaps the point but still nowhere near as convincing as the three big guns. Even an unreasonably funny scene like Night Owl and Spectre making love isn't totally convincing because of the acting.In closing... Watchmen, worth seeing? Yes, very much so, especially if you're a fan already, but maybe so as well if going in blind. A masterpiece of a blockbuster? Not really. It's got some problems in a few scenes such as with the BAM BAM kind of style that if I were a crankier old critic I'd use as an example of the music video age destroying movies (it doesn't bother that much, but it still does subjectively). It was, happy to say, worth the tremendous hype. This being said, if you haven't read the book, do yourself a favor and read it first. Then see the movie.

Snyder has yet to disappoint us,"With tickets sold out the week before it opened, Zack Snyder's visually stunning masterpiece has finally hit the big screen. This movie fought cruel lawsuits (by the Fox A-Holes), release date changes but it still managed to make it's way out of the cutting room floor. It has also already sold more tickets than 300 (which Snyder also directed.) This is based on the comic book created a few years back, which some of you might not have heard of. Now, I'm here with a full page review of it. This takes place in 1985, and the government has no other ideas than to hire a secret organization of superheroes to keep the world under peace. When one of the members is murdered, the others are on a race to find out why, and save themselves before they are all killed. This is a complex, but visually stunning and original superhero tale. I really liked how Snyder designed his own vision of what the 70's looked like, and how he makes all the CGI look real like. You've got to hand it to him, after the hugely successful 300; this will go down as one of his best works as well. However, even if this is a comic book masterpiece it is absolutely not a movie for kids or even the faint of heart. All the themes in this movie are mature, and it's meant for an adult audience. Snyder mentioned in a column for Entertainment weekly ""I wanted to make sure everyone understood: This is not a kid movie. Violence has consequences,"" and true to his words, there's a large amount of earth shattering and realistic violence in this movie. You can count on seeing a man's arm being ripped off, a man's face being burned by hot oil, and plenty more. Like the comic book, the movie has a lot of mature materiel such as government, vigilante, corruption, poverty, and plenty of other themes you wouldn't expect a 13 year to understand. Not to mention there's a lot of mature content and a rape scene where I closed my eyes on. Actor Jeffery Dean Morgan (Grey's Anatomy) also mentioned that some of the scenes in this movie disturbed him, especially the original ending for this. The original ending was edited due to its graphic nature and how disturbing it was to some audience members. I mentioned at my school the other day if I see any kid under my age going or sneaking in to see this, I am going to kindly go out, tell the ticket manager, and pay for their way into another movie. In fact the UK has this rated at M18, which means no one under that age can get in even with a parent. I was only able to get in because I had my ID on me which clearly stated that I'm 18 (which I am.) I went to see this because I read the comic book (even if I didn't understand some of it), I both stunned visually, and plot wise by it. As for the movie, it followed the comic book, and it does a wonderful job of doing so. However the comic also contained some of the content mentioned here so I wasn't surprised by all the violence in the movie, but found it shocking. This is a visually brilliant and impressive movie, but it's not for kids. Instead rent them Iron Man which is a movie for them. work, us fans of the comic book appreciate what you're doing and, for anyone looking for a film that's 100% faithful to the graphic novel or is looking into being blown away visually, this one's for you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A Top Notch Picture,"Watchmen {dir. Zack Snyder, 2009} (****/****)Although it loses some luster upon second viewing, Watchmen remains a top-notch movie. It is strictly loyal to the source, and actually improves upon the ending. (Sorry squid-lovers!) Yes, the sex scene is gratuitous, but I'll give Snyder room to take one false move when the rest of the film is this good. Beautiful to look at and interestingly plotted, Watchmen resembles Kubrick in the way it seems game to go against every rule of the comic book genre. Needless to say, we are a long way away from the mindless antics of Daredevil or Ghost Rider. This blockbuster has a brain to match its brawn.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
the best they could do with a hard-to-adapt book,"In an alternate version of the mid-eighties where Nixon is serving a third term, costumed heroes are outlawed, but they must unite to fight an oncoming threat. That's a shabby outline, but it's hard to summarize this plot. I read the comic book this is based on, and the adaptation turned out pretty much exactly as I expected: faithful but lacking most of the book's more subtle shadings.Watchmen is one of those things people have long said couldn't be filmed. They were wrong, and this is about as good a job as anyone could be expected to do. But it still left me unsatisfied. It's certainly entertaining, and the movie gets the characters right (especially my favourite, Rorschach, thanks in large part to actor Jackie Earle Haley). The book is dark, moody, and ambiguous whereas this is a loud and boisterous action film. One of the main problems is that it makes every character ""cool"", which takes away some of the depth found in the book. It also fails to provide a proper build-up to the reveal of the ""villain""'s plan (which has been changed from the book to something rather mundane). And the fight scenes are generically shot. Director Zack Snyder really needs to lose his distracting affectation of switching from slow motion to regular speed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A dazzling masterpiece!,"Somewhere in New York City in the year 1985 in a alternate dimension, Richard Nixon is still president and superheroes have existed before they were outlawed for they were once mighty and proud. A former super soldier named The Comedian (Jeffery Dean Morgan) was brutally murdered mysteriously for he worked for a former superhero group called CrimeBusters as his friends Roschach (Jackie Earle Haley) who is a mysterious blank-faced masked avenger, Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) who is a blue-skinned nude god-like being. Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman) who is a very sexy crime-fighting babe and the mysterious yet very smart NightOwl (Patrick Wilson) all join together to solve the case of the Comedian's death. They are also trying to find out who is also behind an upcoming government conspiracy that could cause World War III for they must find that perpetrator and stop him or her before it's too late.Co-starring Matt Frewer, This is a brilliant adaptation of the ultimate graphic novel in Existence known as ""Watchmen"" from Alan Moore and David Gibbons including DC comics. After years of development hell since 1986, it seems Warner with Paramount and DC films have green-lighted the film in 2006 after Zack Sydner's ""300"" was a major success including an excellent adaptation of a graphic novel was signed on as director who was a big fan of the ""Watchmen"" graphic novel as he even studied it as storyboards for the film. The film does have the spirit of the comics's satire on politics and superheroes as it takes the audience into an alternate world unlike anyone has ever seen before since ""The Matrix"". The film is quite a complex yet provocative film just like the graphic novel but this superhero movie sure ain't one for kids cause this one is rated R for good reason folks due to some language, nudity, sexuality and graphic gory violence but more of a grown-up's superhero movie. Greg Cannom's make-up effects are just superb including the visual effects with action sequences, i think this is Zack Sydner's greatest motion picture yet and one of the true comic book to movie greats in recent memory.Although the ending was changed, it doesn't matter cause i think this movie delivers some stuff that fans would crave. The acting was even solid too including the action, i give thanks to Zack Sydner and Co to bring the beloved graphic novel to the big screen in a successful way. I can't wait for the extended cut Blu-Ray which should rock and even make the movie be more better to some audiences.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Ground breaking in many ways, but still makes you hark for old time superhero movies","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningFor many years, the 'Watchmen' guarded society and took care of the bad guys, until public opinion turned against them and they vanished from the public eye. Now, in 1985, former frontline member The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is found murdered and the old team start to wonder why. When an even bigger conspiracy to maybe murder more of them is unraveled, former members and some of their off-spring team together to search for the culprit before he strikes again, taking them down a deadly path where people they thought they could trust may turn out to be their deadliest enemies.300 director Zack Snyder's take on the apparently (I don't think I was around when they came out!) hugely successful graphic comic books puts a subversive slant on the comic book genre. This market, almost exclusively aimed at the younger end of the cinema going population (and understandably so) is here given a lengthy, back story trouting treatment, saturated with blood splattered violence, graphic sex and strong language. The fantasy characters, with their masks, capes and costumes can't help but keep the viewer entrenched in the child like world the comic book is aimed at, and getting it such an adult rating is a risky gamble that could backfire as much as it could pay off.Despite running in at nearly three hours and having little in the way of a discernible plot, Watchmen still managed the trick of never keeping me bored or looking at my watch during it. The visuals, special effects and action sequences are fantastic, and by the end you've certainly stuck with it long enough to feel thoroughly immersed in these character's histories, emotions and memoirs. But the film is following a modern trend by deviating away from the main story and taking up a lot of time digging up the history of the main characters to keep us involved in the story at hand, which only ends up serving the exact opposite, weighing the audience down with long winded mouths of dialogue that fail to flow off the tongue properly.Comic book movies, even if they stretched in just over the two hour mark, used to be simple escapist entertainment which required no brain power, mainly for the under twelves who's minds were more suited to the fantasy element. Now they're all trying to be deep and meaningful, with most of the focus on back story and trying to be all clever and cynical at the same time. If they carry on like this, there's a real risk they could alienate some devoted followers who'll feel their market has been violated. ***",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"A tough pill to swallow, Watchmen will have you choking and gasping for air as the third act rolls around.","In any sort of entertainment, you need to finish strong. Your song, speech, video game, movie, television show needs to finish out on top, wrap things up nicely---whether optimistically or pessimistically. Methods of entertainment can start slow, maybe even build slow, but should not, at any given moment finish slowly or in a weak matter. Watchman unfortunately fails to do this; and it's worse considering that the subject matter is such a highly-acclaimed one. While Watchman was a tough pill to swallow in the beginning and the middle, it becomes unbearably awful in the final act, and quite frankly demolishes any chance of this matching up to the comic book we so love.Watchman is about a retired group of superheroes coming together after the murder of one of their own, The Comedian. With the silent investigation headed by Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley), he reveals that the murder is part of something much bigger than just a random act of violence. In the meantime, the other superheroes are having a lot of trouble adapting to real life after their fame and fortune passed; while the United States is inches away from nuclear war. The themes explored here and unlike that of the typical comic book fare; themes of fate, God, destiny, war, apocalypse, and sacrifice are crucial to the entire plot and throughout the film remain a hot topic. David Hayter and Alex Tse had the tough job of being able to translate the massive comic book into film within a suitable running time.Let's at least praise the effects. While a blue male bearing it all dozens of times isn't exactly to my liking, the special effects in Watchmen are indeed quite spectacular. While it lacks the visual style and edge of 300 or Sin City, they remain a sight to see. The highly stylized fights aren't as lengthy as Zack Snyder's previous comic adaptation, but are still fun to watch. The hits, strikes, and beatdowns are especially gruesome, cringe-worthy in some instances. Zack Snyder knows what keeps his audience riveted and sprinkles a few nasty fights from time to time to keep us on our toes.The acting itself is grand as well, especially that of Jackie Earle Haley, who plays Rorschach. Not only is his character the best fleshed-out character, but also is the one that steals the spotlight the most with good delivery, funny one-liners, and more raw emotion than any other actor and actress on screen. Everyone else did a respectable job, although some of the extras are laughable when they shouldn't be.Watchmen's downfall is definitely the complexity of it all. While a complex story is riveting most of the time, you must be able to guide the audience in a certain direction so that it doesn't look like the film is suffering a seizure and is mixing up the chronological order like shuffling of cards. The pacing of the film is extremely slow, and likes to reach into the past without giving you a hintage of warning. It becomes lingering and even annoying at times, although it does develop the main characters a bit more. The pacing is uneven because quick-paced fights are blending in with the slow scenes of excessive dialogue, backstory, and character progress. With the exception of Rorschach, there is little to care about, we don't feel much of a connection with the characters. Snyder did a decent job explaining a lot in a few moments (See the opening credits) but then adds unnecessary scenes and elongated scenes.Then comes the third act. The entire film falls apart like a bad game of Jenga. The pacing totally grinds into a halt, the ending comes much too slowly, nothing is explained, no emotions will come out of you, there are unnecessary fights, and quite frankly we the audience just flat-out stopped caring for anyone. Literally, you'd have to have extensive knowledge of the comic book in order to have a better appreciation of the whole body of work itself. However, it's a flaw for us as an audience to have to do research in order to receive full enjoyment out of a film. People started walking out of the theater, people start squirming more in their seats, and as the credits rolled, silence filled the cinema.Bottom Line: In order to watch the Watchmen and actually care, you must read Watchmen. It sounds very obvious, but The Dark Knight is a well-accepted and loved film, and I can guarantee you that most of the viewers hadn't honesty read a Batman comic book. The difference is we cared for Batman and his companions. In this case, we honestly don't, because they tried explaining so much, and chose the wrong things to explainleading to characters with weak and little development, unnecessary scenes, and a lack of connection with our heroes. The themes are explored but not fully fleshed out, the plot itself is accurate but also lacks a true interpretation, and the final act just damages the entire film.Zack Snyder has the energy to make comic books scream to life with entertainment (as proved in 300) but just didn't end Watchmen well at all. The ending may alienate some, but will frustrate more. 150+ minutes is long enough, no need to make it worse by dragging it by its knuckles. Beware of slow pacing and a very convoluted, complicated plot that will require previous knowledge, multiple viewings, and lot of patience.Then a tolerance for disappointment.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Excellent Movie from Dated Material,"Many people say that the Watchmen movie had a hard job to live up to its source material, the original graphic novel. But although it's an excellent asset in terms of its characters and philosophical underpinnings, the novel is a liability because it forces the director to create a revisionist historical science fiction movie. I mean, how do you recreate the tension of nuclear holocaust and transmit it to a public that is too young to remember it? How can you remember that it's in the 1980's when you see a flying owl-mobile? (Notice that I haven't read the novel)When you forget the scenery because you're too busy watching the fight scenes and the 80's background starts to sound like a oldies radio station, you begin to pay attention to the sum of its parts instead of the whole.Fortunately, Watchmen has great parts that shouldn't leave you disappointed. For example, the relatively-unknown three-name actors who play Rorschach and The Comedian. Their excellent work allows you to contemplate a couple of fully-drawn characters that are more psychopaths than superheroes. If you extract the Rorschach story from the movie, you could have a film that stands on its own.Dr Manhattan, besides distracting you by being blue, CGI and naked, still has enough lines to make you imagine what it would be like to be a omnipotent entity that gets sick and tired of mingling with humans.The fight scenes are very 300-like but since most of us forgot 300 and were embarrassed to rent it again, the speed slow-down and acceleration effect is a guilty joy to watch.In essence, if you haven't read the novel and don't have any expectations for this movie ""changing your life"" or anything like it, you're certainly enjoy it for the visual treat and the sheer effort of each one of the people involved, specially the director and his actors.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Go watch the Watchmen,"Zach Snyder was never going to please everybody with his adaptation of the dense, labyrinth novel. But he can definitely feel he's done justice to what couldn't have been an easy thing to adapt. Whats surprising is how faithful the film is to the novel, with whole pages seemingly ripped from the book right up there on the screen! From a fans point of view i got a big kick out of seeing my favourite scenes and characters finally come to life on the big screen. One of the most important aspects in the films success is having the right actors for the film. Thankfully Snyder gets this right. Patrick Wilson nails Night Owl 2 perfectly, Billy Crudup brings Dr Manhattan to life in a way thats tortured and moving, Matthew Goode brings the right amount of cool and arrogance to Veidt, becoming especially effective in the third act. Malin Akerman has been underrated for her Silk Spectre 2 performance, but i think she is excellent in probably the hardest part to pull off. Best of all is Jackie Earle Haley as Rorshach. This guy owns the whole film and its electric whenever he's on screen.The film looks great and the effects are all top notch. Dr Manhattan is a joy to behold the way he is presented in the film. The Mars scenes are stunning and its great that the smiley face on Mars panel from the novel has been reproduced on film. The Owl ship also looks great and its flying scenes are beautifully shot.The songs used in the film work surprisingly well, from Dylan, Nat King Cole and Hendrix etc, and the score from Tyler Bates is very good.Snyder wisely ups the action quota from the novel, and its well shot with no confusing editing ( unlike TDK) and its also very violent and bloody.Watchmen won't be for everyone of course and the film will take 2 or more viewings to sink in, but i think thats a good sign of the films quality and longevity.I look forward to the extended cut on DVD when it comes out because i think this film will benefit from repeated viewing and will become a huge cult classic in the same way as Blade Runner did.

I have had enough...,"From the moment I stepped out of the 12:01 a.m. showing of The Watchmen, I have heard nothing but bitching. Yes, the ending veers from the graphic novel's. Yes, this is not a ""POP CORN MOVIE"". And the obvious answer, yes, they are not typical super heroes.The idea of this story was not to shock and aw the masses at the miraculous feats of strength or valor that these individuals could accomplish. The idea was to save humanity from its own apathetic instincts against all odds. DM and OM took this idea to the extreme, and with results. R and NO bolted down the ideology of a perfect morality of their own, limited results.Then we come to the Comedian. This is one of the most revered characters' in the history of the DC cannon. If critics think that Zack Snyder gets at least one thing perfect (besides Rorschach), its Edward Blake. The normal viewer of this film should be expected to walk away hating this character. Yet again, Snyder pulls off his magic of allowing the audience to invite this antihero into the heart of the story.Beyond the fact that the film was visually, audibly, and seamless in its entirety, critics need to take a step back and realize the depth and difficulty of such an adaptation. Yes the graphic novel is a one of a kind. No, there will never be an equal. But, as viewers, we should admire the achievement that we have had the privilege to witness. Alan Moore, with all right, may not appreciate the film because it was never written to be on the big screen. One should revel in the fact that his idea and story has been introduced to a wider audience. In the end that is all and writer can ask for to have their work expanded and adapted to fit our modern society.Great NOVEL, great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Mediocre cast but still a good film,"Being a big fan of Watchmen (the graphic novel) that is i was excited about this film finally being made. Then i looked at the cast list and was like ""Who?"". I'd heard good things about Jackie Earle Haley and had seen Jeffrey Dean Morgan (Who i personally think looks like a cheap Javier Bardem) in one episode of Greys Anatomy.Unfortunately when watching the film i wasn't quite as thrilled as i was when reading the book and i think again the cast was a big part of this. While most comic book movies rely on their special effects and eccentric characters, Watchmen had attracted me because of its focus on morality and the deep characters (much more to them than your average comic book hero). Matthew Goode provided just the right amount of arrogance and slight homosexuality throughout but the real scenes where his character has an opportunity for complex emotion he seems rigid and uncompromising (may have been on purpose but i doubt it). Patrick Wilson was neither good or bad just perfectly mediocre and to be fair to Wilson the character doesn't provide much opportunity to flex his acting muscle. Malin Akerman is again mediocre and comes of as rather immature. Billy Crudup is good as the pre-transformation Dr.Manhattan but the coldness and robotic nature of the character don't allow him to act much. Lastly Jackie Earle Haley was amazing as Rorschach. When i first saw pictures of Haley i was worried he wouldn't sport the fiery red hair of Rorschach but he does and in every seen he is perfectly chaotic, psychotic and soulless. The performance itself will see Jackie Earle Haley play many mentally damaged and unstable characters in the future (e.g. Shutter Island) and was truly perfect especially in the scene where we first see him unmasked (trying to avoid spoilers) and he screams ""Give me back my face!"".I would also like to add that while i love many of the songs used in this film that the music was poorly placed into scenes and often doesn't add to it e.g the ""99 Red Balloons"" scene. The opening montage with ""The Times they are a changin'"" by Bob Dylan is however exquisite and a great prologue to the film.The special effects were good and were a big part in the massive budget for the film but i think Zach Snyder should have gone down a different route and focused on the acting and casting. I will say however that - like he does in 300 - Snyder immerses you in the Watchmen alternate 1985 world perfectly. The special effects, Snyders Immersion and Haley's performance make the film good but what could of been a great ensemble piece (Jude Law and John Cusack wanted to be in the film) is let down by a lack of stellar performances.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A superhero soap opera well deserving of its hype,"Hype can be a powerful thing. It can propel a movie to greatness and expose it to a larger audience (See also: Fight Club), or it can cause viewers to expect far too much and then become inevitably disappointed with the movie's inability to live up to the word on the street. Such was the case with 2008's summer blockbuster/alleged masterpiece of modern cinema, The Dark Knight. While Watchmen may be compared to The Dark Knight due to both films dealing with costumed vigilantes fabricated by the DC Comics company, the comparisons end there. Watchmen is far more deserving of its hype. This film is in no way an average ordinary superhero movie. (And yes, I did just make a Smash Mouth reference, thanks.) Watchmen is set is a decaying alternate reality of 1985 New York City. In the film, Richard Nixon has been elected for a third term (this takes the setting from ""dystopian"" to ""Post Apocalyptic"") and because of this the US and the USSR are incredibly close to destroying each other with all out nuclear war. Meanwhile, the murder of a friend causes a dysfunctional group of retired superheroes, The Watchmen to slowly come out of retirement for an investigation. These two plot points mesh to form a highly interesting, gripping story with good pacing.One of the best things about this film is the characterization. Each member of the Watchmen has an interesting and unique back story. None of the characters are without flaws either, which makes them all the more interesting to watch and learn about. Among the most interesting characters are Rorschach, a sociopathic man who narrates the film through his diary composed of misanthropic, cynical commentary on life in The Big Apple; Dr. Manhattan, a Blue-Man Group reject / nudist who takes out his frustration at rejection by accidentally gaining godlike powers in freak physics accident and as such has lost touch with humanity; and The Comedian a ""hero"" with highly questionable morals. A back story is told via flashback for each character that provides clues as to their motives.The directing was also very well done. I personally do not find Zack Snyder to be a great director and find his style to be aptly described with the phrase ""all fluff and little substance"", but Watchmen proves this wrong. Indeed, this film has far more substance than the average movie. This is due to the multilayered story presented in the comic (excuse me, I mean ""Graphic Novel"") that provides source material. The film explores themes of morality being relative as well as the power of the media. Nothing in this movie happens like you'd expect it to in a traditional superhero film.However, this isn't to say the film is without its flaws. Some of the story is hard to follow at certain points, particularly the main conflict that leads to the final showdown of the film. This seems highly rushed and almost tacked on. Nothing truly indicates the twist and there is little foreshadowing. Another thing, like any action movie in this post-Matrix world, Watchmen utilizes slow motion far more than is necessary. This could be a lot worse, however. I mean, come on, we're talking about the director of 300 here. Finally, the large length of the film may bore some of the more ADD afflicted members of the internet generation, but the length could please viewers who like films with a lot of aspects.The film also contains graphic violence and large quantities of sex and nudity that probably shouldn't be viewed by younger audiences. Watchmen is very much a superhero soap opera designed for adults and mature teenagers. Do not imagine it to be as clean as the Spiderman movies. Take your kids to see The Incredibles or something, they probably won't know the difference. Regardless, this film is highly recommended. You should go watch the Watchmen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Visual Dazzle Not Enough to Elevate the Revered Graphic Novel,"I should preface my review by admitting I have never read Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' 1987 graphic novel upon which this movie is based, and from my understanding, quite faithfully, at least until the end. Without such context, much less the fan-boy enthusiasm, this 2009 comic-book extravaganza is hamstrung by the limitations of conventional film-making despite a marathon 155-minute running time. The story is quite dense and multi-layered at first exposure, and while the alternate universe presented has strong entertainment value, there is less of a case for the frequent use of gratuitous violence to punctuate the nihilism of the story. Director Zack Snyder is an inspired choice to lead the character-driven mayhem given the visual invention he brought to the Battle of Thermopylae in 2007's ""300"". His sharp eye for detail is evident throughout this elaborate production, but the movie has problems with pacing and more critically, a palpable absence of soul that would have made it more directly comparable to Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"".Set in an alternate-reality 1985 with Richard Nixon in his fifth term, the story has the Cold War moving into high gear with the Soviets willing to test our country's resolve with the potential of a nuclear strike. The opening credits effectively trace the semi-familiar history that brings the plot to this point with golden-era, costumed crime-fighters giving way to the next generation of superheroes in the 1970's. Snyder goes as far as recreating the Zapruder video of the Kennedy assassination with the smoking gun held by the morally bankrupt Comedian, one of the Watchmen who moved from WWII-era pop icon to reviled vigilante three decades later. Looking like the dark side of DC Comics' Justice League of America, the Watchmen had long disbanded by the time the Comedian is murdered in his apartment. This sparks at least some of the confederation to reunite albeit with trepidation. They turn out to be a motley group of psychological misfits beginning with Laurie Jupiter, a.k.a. Silk Spectre II, hesitant about wearing her latex suit again to fight for justice like her now-alcoholic mother, and Nite Owl, a fallen man reduced to impotence by retirement.More interesting are Dr. Manhattan, blue-skinned and nude with the power of a god thanks to a Hulk-like paranormal lab accident; and Ozymandias, now known as Adrian Viedt, the world's smartest man and a billionaire captain of industry. However, the most intriguing Watchman is the appropriately named Rorschach, who wears a face mask with constantly shifting ink blots. A true loner in the tradition of Travis Bickle in ""Taxi Driver"", he expresses a visceral loathing for mankind's dissoluteness that manifests itself into the film's goriest scenes. All the characters feel disconnected from humanity, and their warped perspectives drive the story. While Snyder pulls few punches in his depiction of them, the primary problem with the film is that he can't seem to pull it all together to make a dark-hearted adventure that can soar. Except for a clever use of Bob Dylan's ""The Times, They Are A-Changin'"" over the opening credits, Snyder's use of period music simply feels intrusive and out-of-sync without adding any texture to the film.Much of the comic-book-level dialogue also feels stilted, and unfortunately, few in the cast seem to know how to deliver it with conviction. The best of the bunch are Billy Crudup as the eerily becalming Dr. Manhattan and Jackie Earle Haley constantly seething with Eastwood-level rage as Rorschach. Jeffrey Dean Morgan registers with conviction in just a few scenes as the Comedian. However, their contributions are offset by the miscalculated performances of a too-bland Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl, Matthew Goode looking overly metrosexual as Ozymandia, and Malin Ackerman who plays Laurie in a petulant manner that trivializes her character's ambivalence about being a superhero. Granted there are good set-pieces like the bravura fight scene right at the beginning. Unfortunately, saddled with some surprisingly substandard CGI, the final scenes wring dramatically flat given the build-up to them, and they dampen my appetite for a sequel with the survivors. Even with all its flaws, the film boasts a visual audacity that is hard to pass up, especially if your appetite has been whetted by the novel. Clearly, Snyder has put greater priority in maintaining fidelity to the source material rather than making a movie that could resonate for the rest of us.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Awesome,"Comic books had their heyday from the Great Depression through the fifties. Although they are not as popular now as they were at the time, they still have their devoted fans (the tide does appear to be changing with the rising popularity of Japanese animation, or manga). ""Watchmen"" is considered the greatest graphic novel of all time (and TIME magazine listed it as one of the greatest novels of the 20th century). Having read it (but not being a comic book fan myself), I can say that Alan Moore's graphic novel is very good, but most of its accolades are unwarranted. Many of the themes present have been told before, and seem rather tired (that being said, I read it about a quarter of a century after its initial publication, so maybe time simply hasn't been good to it).That being said, Zack Snyder's film version is not only excellent, but in my opinion, it's better than the source material. The graphic novel was dense and at times highly confusing, forcing me to go back and revisit past parts of the story. The film version is more streamlined, and less padded, without losing any of the book's impact or intelligence. I don't understand why the audience reaction was so polarized. Of course there are the hard-core fans, who think any film version will be a butchery of their Holy Bible (past attempts at filming hit books have proved them right for the most part). Then there's the writer, Alan Moore, who refused to have his name listed as the author of the book, but he's done that ever since ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" came out (an over-reaction in my book. While ""LXG"" was no ""The Dark Knight,"" it's entertaining to watch when it's on TV).Speaking of ""The Dark Knight,"" that's probably the film to compare ""Watchmen"" to. This is no ""Spider-Man."" ""Watchmen"" is a dark, violent and menacing world. The R-rating is warranted (for once). Not only does it contain some gory violence (though not as much as the MPAA would lead you to believe), it contains the first sex scene on film in years.""Watchmen"" takes place in an alternate reality. It's 1985, and Nixon is still the President (Watergate is never addressed). In the past, men and women dressed up in costumes with the requisite gadgets and fought crime, or committed it. But legal action has made crime-fighting superheroes a thing of the past, so all the ex-heroes can do is go about their days like everyone else and reminisce about the past. However, for a group of superheroes who called themselves the ""Watchmen,"" a new threat has surfaced. One of their crew was murdered, and the threat of a ""mask killer"" puts them all in danger.The most apparent change is most of the material regarding the first band of ""Watchmen"" has been eliminated. In my opinion, this was a good move, since that stuff made the story more convoluted than necessary, and never really added anything anyway. Most of the material remains, however, and I swear some of the dialogue has been lifted directly from the novel itself. That's good, because some of the dialogue is brilliant (and not just the catchphrases).The acting is surprisingly good. Malin Ackerman is solid as Silk Spectre II. She's an ordinary girl with an extraordinary past. Patrick Wilson is a big surprise as Nite Owl II. He's an effective lead, despite having a past of flat performances (he has some bland moments here, too, but overall his low-key portrayal works). Matthew Goode is rather flat as Adrian Veidt/Ozymandias, although the script's version of the character didn't come out very well. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is good as the gruff Comedian. He's dark and vicious, but The Comedian was never a well-developed character to begin with, and that hasn't changed here. Jackie Earl Haley is excellent as Rorschach, the dangerous psychopath who took the vigilante part of being a superhero to heart. However, the biggest surprise is Billy Crudup. Save for a few feature film appearances, Crudup has laid low with his career, but his Dr. Manhattan gives him a chance to display his true talent. Of all the Watchmen, Dr. Manhattan is truly the most dynamic. He has the traditional superhero origins (a scientific experiment gone awry), but Moore opted for something far less conventional. Crudup (and Snyder) respect that. Dr. Manhattan has become superhuman, and in so doing, he becomes alienated from humanity. This, and the resulting toll it has on his relationships, is perfectly portrayed by Crudup.Zack Snyder got the public's attention with his re-envisioning of ""Dawn of the Dead,"" but he REALLY burst onto the scene with his stunning and visually arresting version of ""300."" Snyder clearly has a sense of visual flair. It suits him well for ""Watchmen,"" but Moore's comic has a more complex story, and to bring a competent version of the novel to the screen, a director has to have a good sense of how to tell a story. Snyder has it, and that's what makes this film so good. There are times where he borders on overuse with the camera tricks, but it's not excessive. But Snyder can tell a story in a way that is clear and concise, but also involving.""Watchmen"" isn't flawless, but it's one of the best superhero movies ever to come out in a while.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Overlong and confusing- yet asks some pertinent questions,"Let's get this out of the way. I have never read the comic series (aka graphic novel) on which ""Watchmen"" is based, so I am not in a position to say whether the movie is as good as its source material. The comic came out in the years 1986-1987, and plans to make a film adaptation were first announced soon after its publication, but nothing came of them for another two decades. At one time former Python Terry Gilliam was scheduled to direct, but he dropped out, describing the comic as ""unfilmable"".The film was eventually made in 2009, directed by Zack Snyder, and keeps the mid-eighties setting. This is, however, an alternate history version of the eighties. The main difference between this alternate reality and our world is that superheroes not only exist but also get involved in, and influence, political events. In this reality the United States used the powers of these superheroes to win the Vietnam War. In gratitude the American people elected President Nixon to a third term in 1976 and, as the main action begins in 1985, he has just begun his fifth term. (This is a world in which the 22nd Amendment has been repealed and the Watergate affair either never occurred or was successfully covered up). In the real world, the mid-eighties saw the rise to power of Mikhail Gorbachev and a thaw in relationships between the Soviet Union and the West. In the film, however, America's victory in Vietnam has only served to make the Soviets even more paranoid and suspicious and the Cold War has become colder than ever, with the two countries on the verge of war.The American people's gratitude does not extend to the superheroes who won the war for them. A wave of anti-vigilante sentiment has led to the passing of a law forbidding superhero activity. The ""Watchmen"", the group of superheroes featured here, now mostly live in retirement or become government agents. One of the group, Edward Blake, who went by the name ""the Comedian"", is found murdered. His former colleagues began to suspect that there may be a conspiracy to eliminate them. I won't set out the rest of the plot in any detail, because it becomes very complicated, but I can say that there is indeed a conspiracy, more terrible and far-reaching than the Watchmen originally suspect.A dark, brooding look has become commonplace for superhero films, but the darkness of ""Watchmen"" is rather different to that of, say, Tim Burton's ""Batman"". Whereas Burton was influenced by Gothic horror, Snyder's vision is closer to that of the film noir crime dramas of the forties and fifties, even though the film was made in colour rather than black-and-white. The film shares another feature with noir, that of moral ambiguity, something more pronounced here than it is in most superhero movies. Burton's Batman may have a dark side to his personality and bear little resemblance to the jovial character portrayed by Adam West in the TV series, but at the end of the day he is still the hero and the Joker the villain of the piece. In ""Watchmen"", by contrast, it is difficult to say who are the heroes and who the villains. One of the group is the instigator of the conspiracy mentioned in the previous paragraph, and some of his colleagues are virtually indistinguishable from the supervillains against whom they fight. (Blake, for example, had an almost psychopathic personality).Some have criticised the film for keeping the eighties setting, but I am not sure if there is any other way it could have been made. Certainly, Cold War thrillers, especially those dealing with the possibility of US/Soviet nuclear confrontation, have a very dated feel today, but it would have been difficult to adapt the storyline of ""Watchmen"" to the very different political circumstances of the late noughties. I would, however, agree with some other criticisms, namely that the film is overlong and that the plot can be over-complex and difficult to follow. I found the character of ""Doctor Manhattan"", a scientist who following a laboratory accident has been left with virtually godlike powers going far beyond those of even the average superhero, difficult to accept, even by the unrealistic standards of the genre.On the other hand, there is some decent acting; the film has a large ensemble cast, meaning that there is not room to set out all the noteworthy performances, but two that caught my eye were from Malin Åkerman as Silk Spectre and Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach, two of the Watchmen. As a ""film of ideas"" ""Watchmen"" may be somewhat confusing, yet it does ask some pertinent questions about matters of perennial interest- crime and punishment, war and peace, guilt and innocence, even good and evil. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Well crafted. Zack Snyder at his best.,"In a nutshell, my review for this move boils down to three words- Clever, complex and complete. Fresh on the heels of his unexpected smash hit ""300"", director Zack Snyder outdoes himself with this comic book adaptation. Unfortunately for Snyder, Christopher Nolan had the upper-hand with 2009's box-office bomb, ""The Dark Knight"". Even so, Snyder's work here is a painstaking and well crafted movie that is targeted at a mature audience.The story is adapted from Alan Moore's independent comic book by the same name with acquisition by DC Comics for a full blown screenplay. Through the opening credits, we are introduced to caped vigilantes of the 1930s and 1940s. Calling themselves the Watchmen, most of them are now retired after having helped the US government through the Vietnam War and averting the Cuban Missile Crises. Hmmm, so this is where X Men: First Class got its inspiration. After the John F Kennedy assassination and ensuing public outcry, the Watchmen are now disbanded and living on their own. With each receiving proper introductions and ample screen time, they are Edward Blake AKA the Comedian, Walter Kovacks AKA Rorschach, Daniel Dreiberg AKA Nite Owl, Adrian Veidt AKA Ozymandias, Laurie Jupiter AKA Silk Spectre II and Dr. Manhattan, the only former member with immense superpowers. Following the murder of the Comedian, Rorschach gets in touch with Nite Owl, Dr. Manhattan (now living with Silk Spectre II) and Ozymandias trying to warn each that former members of the Watchmen are being assassinated. With ties to the government and having put so many criminals behind bars, it is easy to see why anyone would want them dead. While Rorschach and Nite Owl investigate the Comedian's death, Dr. Manhattan and Silk Spectre realizes problem with their relationship with Manhattan distancing himself from humanity. In the meanwhile, the doomsday clock is ticking with the world bracing for nuclear war between the United States and the Soviets. But with the Watchmen retired, unwanted and stalked by a mysterious assassin, who will now save the world from total annihilation?Set in 1985 with Richard Nixon running his third term as president of the United States, this film is a clever analogy to the cold war crises of the mid 1980s. The essence of the plot is seamlessly grafting historical events with fiction, resulting in a very plausible story. Once again, kudos to Snyder for breaking out a movie other directors and producers have tried and abandoned since 1986. Their failure can be vindicated by the fact that the story itself is intricate enough to adapt on screen. Then there is mandatory character development, alternate history, and the current film making technology that was lacking 25 years ago. Although this film offers ample doses of high-end visual effects and CGI, the main focus is on character development, making this a true character driven film. As such, acting is flawless from a star studded lineup. Most notable are Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian, Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl, Malin Ậkerman as Silk Spectre II and Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. Dr. Manhattan is entirely CGI rendered but voiced by Billy Crudup. Special mention also goes to Robert Wisden as Richard Nixon and Carla Gugino as Silk Pectre.All aspects considered, Snyder has truly cut a niche out for himself. But as I mentioned before, this film was overshadowed by ""The Dark knight"" because Watchmen is not intended for a teenage audience and is not your run-of-the-mill superhero caper. Yes, the story is engaging from start to finish, but it's the detail that has gone into the production. Cinematography is top notch and Snyder's frequent use of overhead angles of filming adds an extra touch to the look and feel. There is also something unique about combining slow-motion in heavy rain, and this is complemented by an excellent score. The soundtrack on the other hand takes you back to the 70s and 80s and is a perfect choice for the setting. However, be warned that violence is extreme and brutal. Like ""300"", Snyder is unforgiving with blood, gore and guts.What is stopping me from rating this film with 5 stars is the unnecessary inclusion of over 20 minutes of animation, which I find has no relation to the already complex plot. Then again, my review is based on the ""director's ultimate cut"" available only on Blu-ray Disk. Had I watched the DVD version containing the ""Director's cut"", I would have rated this film with every star it deserves. I also thought the ending was a bit disappointing in comparison to the rest of the story. But overlooking this inclusion, watching this movie is an event in itself, not because of the two and half hour of engagement time, but due to its epic scale in storytelling. For a truly uninterrupted viewing experience, turn your phones silent and watch this in one sitting.As a Zach Snyder fan, I eagerly await his next release in re-booting the Superman saga. After what he did for this film, it is just a matter of time before Snyder grabs the whole superhero genre by the horns. For what it's worth, ""Man of Steel"" is rumored to have both Snyder and Nolan working together. Will wonders never cease!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Unassumingly Engaging,"It took me a while to get to watching this show, but after many recommendations, I'm glad I, finally, watched it. The show is well written, superbly acted and beautifully directed. The lighting is a bit too dark lighting at some point (as most cinema is these days), but still visible enough.Since the app wants 600 words before posting, I will add that Regina King is phenomenal in her portrayal of the character. She is so good at her craft. The other actors also rise up to the occasion. This is a good show and hope to get more like this in terms of good directing, immersive acting, clever writing and thoughtful editing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"A big blue tallywhacker reigns supreme, but still a decent story","Watchmen has been one of the movies I've been waiting to see for quite some time now. As a fan of DC comics, I was very hopeful, and given the past history of DC movies I knew it would be either really great or absolutely horrific.It wasn't bad.Granted, there were a few things I had to get past. The graphic violence was tough to watch, frankly. Parents do need to know that this is NOT a kids' comic book movie.I was also distracted initially by Dr. Manhattan's ever-present herculean dong. I'm no prude, by any means, and I have a healthy sex life, but it's just that natural reaction of ""hey, wow, there's that guy's pecker"" and not knowing whether you should look away or what. I get the point of it, but it sort of distracted me from the movie in general. (On a lighter note, it does give new meaning to the term ""blue balls."") Rorshach has been and always will be my favorite character from the Watchmen universe, and he's portrayed here quite beautifully. Jackie Earle Hayley did a superb job of simultaneously making the character an ice-cold action hero and a supremely disturbed psychopath, all rolled up into one big anti-hero. I would've liked to see a movie or series that focused specifically on him.There's a lot of social commentary in the movie. Frankly, you really should read the book first, because it can be confusing if you're not up to speed on when/where/what universe this takes place in.As far as pacing, this movie does last three hours, but it's mostly non-stop the entire way. I didn't tire of the movie so much as I did the actual theater seat. Still, I wouldn't cut the movie any shorter or it would completely lose its punch.All told, I give the movie about an 8, taking away one point for alterations made from the graphic novel, and another point for getting dick-slapped by Dr. Manhattan one too many times.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
I am torn on what to rate this,"Upon seeing this movie I wrote an initial review of my opinion, but realized there was something wrong with it. The problem was that I was spending more time praising Moore's novel than the actual movie, so I deleted it and decided to start from scratch after spending a good deal of time reflecting on the movie and flipping through the panels of the comic.On one hand I love Moore's original story and comic. On the other hand I am not very fond of director Zack Snyder's previous films (the remake of Dawn of the Dead and 300).On one hand this movie mimics the visual style of the novel very well and looks very well polished. On the other hand Snyder and his team in their dedication to perfectly mimicking the story of the graphic novel have made this final product come across as very mechanical and unmoving.So many things done right, but so many done wrong...For the most part the actors pull of their parts, but none of them really go above and beyond to truly make the characters anything more than iconic images lovingly ripped from the panels of Moore's story. There were only two actors who I felt really tried to do something with their characters in an attempt to enhance the characters, and they were Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach and Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian. Aside from these two performances I feel that most of the actors were so determined to fit Snyder's idea of matching the book perfectly that they failed to take the initiative to really try and break the wall and make this movie more than the graphic novel put into motion. But, not to leave him out of this review Billy Crudup did do a satisfactory performance behind the make-up and special effects for his portrayal of Doctor Manhattan, but it wasn't good enough to really get my attention when compared to Earle Haley and Dean Morgan.As far as acting goes I found the acting of Patrick Wilson (Nite Owl II) and Malin Ackerman (Silk Spectre II) to be undeniably stiff in both their respective roles, but the actor who managed to disappoint me most in the entire production would have to be Matthew Goode as Adrian Veidt (AKA: Ozymandias). This man lacked the charisma, and charm I felt when reading the character in the book, and Goode just seems to have no emotion, simply being there to show off his fancy hair, and talk in his accented voice, but I will also say Wilson and Ackerman are only better by a small notch. The performances of these three individuals as a whole were some of the key reasons Watchmen disappointed me as a film.Even with acting problems the production is a good and it is strong. The images are dazzling, and very true to the comic. It is definitely one of best providers of eye candy we're likely to see 2009, but then we have to remember visuals aren't everything, and that's why I was let down by this film.My biggest problem, as I have previously mentioned, is the lack of initiative that the production crew took when making this film. It's like they took up a diet of respectively redoing the comic for twelve weeks until they remembered each panel perfectly and made the actors do the same. Most of the actors don't look like they're really into their roles, and the production is just a fanboy dream come true, but it manages to do one thing that made me mad that keeps me from rating this higher than a seven.If this had just been a visual comic down to the letter I would probably give it an 8/10, but the few times Snyder decides to take action and add in his own little ideas to the plot it just really distracted me from the concept of the story, and ruined the mood for me. What is it that Snyder is adding that angers me so much? Perhaps the most pointless gore and drawn out sex scenes I have ever seen on the big screen.The gore is tacky, and cheap, and distracts from the story, and philosophy behind the images. Many of these images were not in the graphic novel, and nor were they ever even HINTED in the graphic novel. In this movie we have arms broken wide open, a man has his arms cut off, and a man repeatedly has his head cut into by a meat cleaver. None of these moments ever took place in the graphic novel, and I felt they threw off the pace, and distracted the viewers from what was actually going on, and I won't even talk about how he drew out a sex scene that was like six-panels into a 5-10 minute scene.My favorite part was by far the opening credits, and I don't say that in a bad way because it was really a brilliant way to open the movie. To the tune of 'The Times They Are A Changin' we get an animated series of photos that maps out most of the Watchmen's history, the universe they live in, and the setting for the rest of the film. This moment alone makes this movie a must-see for fans of the comics.I can't recommend this film very positively because I for one was disappointed by the finished product. I'm sure many will rave about this film, and it's sure to become a cult-classic, but compared to the graphic novel it really is nothing. Watchmen may be the most endearing comic of all time, and is a classic for the medium, but as a film its impact will not be as lasting as films such as last year's The Dark Knight.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Still Zack Snyder's hallmark movie nearly 10 years after it came out.,"Long before he helped create the ill fated DCEU with Man of Steel and ended it with Justice League, Zack Snyder, known for making a hit remake based on a classic horror film called Dawn of the Dead and making 300 the biggest graphical novel movie of all time, went on to direct a long movie based on the classic DC comic called Watchmen, which came out during the height of the Cold War and became a cult comic among gen xers. A teaser was shown before another DC movie, The Dark Knight, and there was lots of buzz. When it finally came out during March of 2009, it didn't break records like 300 did but made a profit at the theater as well as on home video, where a director's cut was released along with an extended version that included the Tales of the Black Freighter cartoon within the movie that was sold seprately on dvd and bluray in tandem with the film's theatrical release. A videogame composed of chapters was released around the same time on ps3 and xbox 360 to much fanfare, and a soundtrack came out which was pretty good and had My Chemical Romance at its peak. As for the movie itself, it's quite possibly the best epic R Rated comic book movie ever made with an eclectic cast and amazing effects. A TV series based on the franchise is coming out soon on HBO, so watch the movie first and make sure you read the comic book to get your Watchmen fix.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A HUGE Disappointment!,I am one of the fans of this comic book that had read it and understands its purpose. the purpose of putting these vigilantes into a human perspective and their trials and showing that they are human too. after i read the book i was stunned at how amazing it was. this movie ruined all of that. it followed the book maby 70% of the time which i respect and understand that you cant get everything in a movie. thats OK. but still they made this movie a huge joke. in the theaters people were laughing at parts that should not have been funny. and thats not their fault its the makers fault. this is supposed to be a serious story not a action movie with jokes left and right and many sex scenes with horrible music choices in the background. if you saw this movie and said wow this sucks I'm not going to even try to read the book. please! pick it up. this movies does not do it justice in the slightest. amazing book horrible movie. sorry Zack Snyder you optically failed.,2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
One of the best superhero movies of all time.,"First of all, I have not read the graphic novel.And I'm judging this movie purely based on what i saw on screen.And, i give it a 10/10 and regard it as one of the best superhero movies of all time.And there are plenty of others who would agree with me.Now the main reason why this movie stands out among all the other superhero movies we have, is this :Take the majority of the popular superhero movies.In all of them, the superheroes are cut out from the comics and then they are translated to a real life version and then they are put into our world and then on to the screen.We kinda miss out on the world from where they come.And I think rather than a superhero movie where the central idea is ""what if this superhero existed in out world?"", I think it's better if could go into their world and explore what is going on there. Now this has proved to fail( batman and robin).But if done right, it is way more rewarding. That is exactly what Snyder did in Watchmen.It was breath of fresh air and I think it is very underrated.The comical style of the movie is very fascinating.It is truly a feast for your eyes and ears.The characters are great.The theme is dark.It does not hold back at all.Even in the supposedly dark ""Dark knight"", they hold back a lot to make it more younger-audience-friendly.Watchmen does not do that.There is blood, gore, nudity and more darker themes.I'd recommend it to all superhero movie fans.If you haven't seen it already, do check it out. And make sure to watch the Ultimate cut.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Fantastic,"I read the graphic novel, I saw the film opening night, I thought the film was fantastic, and remarkably faithful to the novel. Yes of course certain parts get left out, and certain points got changed, but in my opinion it was for the greater good.I know a lot of people were angry with the movie because they went in expecting something like ""The Fantastic Four"" or ""Spiderman"" or even ""The Dark Knight"", but the issue is that the only real similarity between these movies is the costumed vigilantes.Watchmen is a fantastic story that goes in depth into political and social issues as well as questioning hero-worship and countless other themes. It is an action movie, but it's also a drama. The plot is deep, complex, and gripping.I can honestly say that Watchmen is one of my favourite films and I urge many people to go see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"one of the best, with some reservations","First off: I'd recommend reading the comic first, but it isn't necessary. I went to the movie with my sister and she liked and understood it just fine, though there were one or two minor points that didn't make sense (one due to a detail omitted from the movie, another just because she missed it.) From the perspective of someone who really likes, but is not overly obsessed with, the source material, I can say that it is very good, both as an adaptation and a standalone movie. The attention paid to detail by the filmmakers is appreciated, as are some of the changes they made to the story.The changes range from tiny to massive, really. The ending (the end is the same, but not the means) is changed from the comic, and I think that while it would have been fun to see the original, the one used in the movie functions just as well and is a bit easier to swallow for most people. Something that I both liked and disliked was the omission of a certain character's death. It also slightly disappointed me (and confused my sister) that the origin of Rorschach mask and of his masked identity are never mentioned (if you haven't read the comic and don't plan to, just ask a random person who has to tell you about it. It's worth the two-minute explanation.) The quality of acting runs across a broad spectrum. On one end, we have Malin Ackerman, who barely emotes (even during intense scenes.) Patrick Wilson and Matthew Goode are solid. Also, i you've seen the trailers and Billy Crudup (the blue guy, Doctor Manhattan) seems stiff, his portrayal actually works very, very well. It's not quite what I expected, but the calm monotone really suits, and adds to, his character. And then there's Jackie Earle Haley. Wow. In the words of my sister, ""that guy that played Rorschach is a damn good actor."" Not only is he visually perfect for the role, his out-of-mask acting is awesome (in the most literal sense.) He really brings out the insanity, intensity, and melancholy of the character; his final moments in the movie (and readers of the comic will know what part this is) are nearly perfect in their chilling, electrifying delivery.Of course, it's also a beautiful action movie with a great score and soundtrack (though it may make you cringe every time you hear Leonard Cohen's voice ever again in your life.) The long run-time feels just right. It's got some killer costumes and it's got gore.The gore. Though there isn't too much more of it than in the comic, the aggressively realistic portrayal of bones breaking, mouths foaming, arms being severed and heads splitting makes it seem much more excessive. There are some scenes that have been altered to gorier situations, oddly both of them involving the same character (perhaps to make him seem crazier? I don't know.) It's not for kids or the faint of heart (and features a couple of film's most deeply, intensely awkward sex scenes,) but Watchmen is certainly worth the time and functions well both as a mildly thought-provoking story (particularly for newcomers) and a pretty blockbuster. Watch it, seriously.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"While I believe its heart is in the right place, ""Watchmen"", while not terrible, is a disappointment","""They should have played BTO's 'Gimme Your Money Please' instead of Dylan's 'The Times They Are a-Changin' over the opening credits"".That was my girlfriend's take on ""Watchmen"". While it got a laugh out of the few people who overheard the sentiment, I strongly disagree with her. ""Watchmen"" doesn't feel like a cash-grab. I honestly think it doesn't. What it does feel like is a loving, 'I'll do it right so nobody else messes it up' adaptation. I don't doubt that Zack Snyder has as much love for the source material as I do, and I truly do appreciate what he was trying to do with this film.I'm glad I went in with low expectations due to some of the early reviews, because Snyder's approach, while perhaps seeming to him the only logical approach, to truly film the comic book, is not a cinematic approach. Seen in IMAX, this weakness becomes even clearer. Snyder's storyboards were so close to Dave Gibbons' art that half the movie is shot in stifling close-ups, failing to make even basic use of the widescreen format. Comics and film are not the same medium, and the problems inherent in Snyder's ""Watchmen"" are the same which would be inherent in my taking the comics, copying Moore's script, and adding the most basic descriptions necessary to turn a script into prose, plus a random ultra-stylized sentence every twenty pages.All that said, ""Watchmen"" is not really unwatchable or terrible, except for the direction. The set design is impressive, the look of the ""Watchmen"" world is right, and while the scenes with Nixon are embarrassing, and Malin Akerman really botches some line readings, the performances are generally excellent. Jackie Earle Haley is completely convincing as Rorschach, and I found him to be the perfect embodiment of Rorschach in every way. I look forward to his take on the scenes which will be added in the director's cut, which I will see at some point. Patrick Wilson's absolutely NAILS awkward nerdy Dan, although he's less convincing as Nite Owl. Similarly, I have no complaints regarding Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan, and certainly not Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian, whose visit to Moloch was the only thing I felt the film did better than the comics. The soundtrack would make for a good CD, but some of it is utterly nonsensical and bizarre, and I'm surprised that the scene which has attracted most of the negative attention in this regard is Cohen's ""Hallelujah"" playing over Dan and Laurie's sex scene. At least the song fits with the content of the scene, and the psychology at play, as opposed to most of the other uses of songs in the film.Also, since much of the screenplay is taken directly from the comics, ""Watchmen"" isn't a badly-written film, although some of the additions made to the dialogue are absolutely horrendous on every level, and it is a little structurally messy (again, the idea that you can film a comic is totally nonsensical and not cinematic in the slightest, and this extends to the writing as well). Still, looking at Sam Hamm's script, which might have been made at one point, one can't help but be grateful that the masses have been exposed to some of the quality of the comics, and to these characters, although there is not enough room for proper characterization in this cut of the film, and some of that was sacrificed. Perhaps the film is a lesser achievement than that first trailer which kept copies of ""Watchmen"" flying off the shelves for months before the release of this film, and exposed so many new readers to the excellence of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' work.Perhaps the ultimate irony is that the ""Watchmen Motion Comics"" DVD which is now available, and endorsed by WB, is almost as cinematic as this film. Snyder films the comics, has actors say the lines, and adds slow motion here and there, and some truly atrocious and ill-advised scenes of violence. ""Watchmen Motion Comics"" is six hours long, but is the entire comic, including ""Tales of the Black Freighter"", slightly animated. Lips move, the wind blows, stuff like that. It would be considered quite bad if released to theaters as an animated adaptation of ""Watchmen"" but the real tragedy here is that this film is the live action equivalent of the motion comics, and if you want to watch ""Watchmen"" instead of reading it, that would be the better approach because everything is covered, and because, absurdly enough, it's got a better musical score! ""Watchmen"" is not absolutely atrocious, and certainly not as bad as ""The Spirit"" or a couple of other recent comic book adaptations, thanks mostly to the enjoyable story and the excellent performances, but it is hugely disappointing, largely due to the ineptitude of the simplistic direction, as well as the pointless additions, which clash with the tone of the film. The opening credit sequence is quite fun, though. It's worth seeing once, twice for the extended edition, but that's about it.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
The wrong kind of director for that kind of movie,"It is really amazing how a movie like Watchmen could be so pretty, so true to the book and yet, so Unenjoyable. In retrospect however, it isn't as surprising.While ""Watchmen"" is a humanist story about the various aspects of human soul, Zack Snyder is an expert on gore, style, visuals (""Sin City"") and raising the testosterone of viewers to illegal levels (""300″). He is not, however, someone who can give a soul to comics heroes.Zack did everything he could, but it just isn't his kind of movie. Despite the ""comixie"" appearance, ""Watchmen"" should be done by a director who excels in moving the audience, not one who excels in exciting them. Instead of Zack Snyder, Sam Raimi or Bryan Singer, this movie should've been directed by Todd Solondz or Darren Aronofsky.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Worthy Effort But Doesn't Quite Work,"I was really looking forward to this movie having read the graphic novel. To be honest, I've always felt that the book had its own flaws.

The movie could have used some good editing. Various ideas and scenes could have been condensed. Unfortunately, the final product was a rather slow paced movie with a rather muddled storyline and ideas. Snyder also dropped much of the dark humor elements in the book. On the good side: The acting was well-done. The art direction stunning. The changed ending I felt worked better. Bottom line: a Graphic Novel is NOT a film.

The most stylish superhero film ever made,"This review is based on the three and a half hour ultimate cut of the film.For decades now superhero films have been considered strictly as entertaining movies and not something to be considered an actual art. It wasn't till one of the greatest filmmakers of our time Christopher Nolan stepped into the genre with his Batman films that made people realize that big budget blockbusters can also be an intellectual pieces of art. This is Zack Snyder taking a shot at it.The film opens up with what is one of the best opening sequences I have ever seen, setting up a mystery that the protagonist Rorschach is trying to solve. In only a couple of minutes Snyder was able to set a tone and atmosphere for this dark and bleak world with some truly awe inspiring cinematography with slow-motions, brilliant sound design and intense and violent cut-throat action. All of the above remain excellent through out the entire runtime of the film. Since then the film slows down considerably however due to its three and a half hour runtime that does not hinder the amount of action in this film. There are some truly great performances in this flick as well and the first one I have to mention is Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. He. Was. Phenomenal. And easily the best part about the film in a good way. You truly cared about his character. But not just him. Patrick Wilson once again proved that he is very underrated actor. He had a great chemistry with Malin Akerman who otherwise played a less likable character in Silk Spectre IIBut really what sets this film apart from other superhero movies is the artistic neo-noir element and Snyder's signature direction. The visual storytelling in this film is truly mesmerizing. This most definitely is not your standard by the numbers superhero blockbuster, this is almost an art-house neo-noir thriller story told in a vain of an action flick. It all concludes in a perfectly fitting and disturbing ending that will keep you quiet for the rest of the evening. For this film Zack Snyder truly deserved a title of an auteur. It's easily his best work. I have yet to see a more stylish and artistic superhero film then Watchmen. Not a film for anyone, but that makes it so much better for other like me.This is also my very first review that I have ever written on IMDb, as I feel not enough people have paid a proper attention to this masterpiece. This is what happens when brilliant filmmaker that is Zack Snyder isn't dictated by for money greedy studios.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A Great movie,"I watched this film for the first time without any idea of the plot, or expectations. I was blown away.There has apparently been some controversy about the grittiness of Watchnmen, portraying heroes capable of more cruelty and injustice than the worst antiheroes in cinema.However, it takes a brave, and more to the point, incredibly capable director to be able to make an uncompromising and refreshingly different film that is nonetheless big-budget and mainstream, and Zack Snyder proves in Watchmen that he is such a director.This is not a film to put on the TV while flicking through Facebook or doing odd jobs; it's definitely one to sit down, darken the room, put on the surround sound and absorb every detail, every nuance, every plot point. Because it's excellent.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Review: Watchmen is Excellent, Just Uneven","For a film as ambitious and complex as Zach Snyder's visionary Watchmen, it would be a crime to brand the movie's legacy with a single letter grade or numerical score. Watchmen is above rigid classifications. And while film critics are pioneered watchmen (it is their job, after all to watch films), the most valued watchmen are theater-goers willing to risk $10.75 to satisfy their desire for escapist entertainment. What makes Watchmen so challenging is that it is not easy-watching.While most comic-book flicks these days are purely geared towards escapism, Watchmen compels viewers to consider humanity in its lowest form and think about the human capacity for evil. Snyder brilliantly depicts a world drained of hope in an opening montage of revisionist history meant to challenge viewers to acknowledge the explosion of evil in recent decades. Rather than focusing the introduction on just a character, Snyder sets up the the film's underlying tension of nuclear war by illustrating the increasingly evil nature of humanity over the course of many years.That Snyder was able to capture the essence of human futility by uniquely demonstrating the accumulation of this hopelessness over countless years is a unique vision which deserves praise. And the feel of Watchmen at points can be frighteningly committed to the nihilistic atmosphere Snyder sets up. Snyder's Watchmen in this respect is far more convincing than The Dark Knight in its portrayal of a noir-like dystopia.While Snyder's 300 was visually enthralling, it felt like the kind of disposable entertainment which you can chew up and then spit out. Watchmen, on the other hand, lingers in your mind like a bad spell. The film is more than just visual dessert. It is a philosophical challenge to all viewers to side with their own protagonist. While all (or most the Watchmen, depending on your opinion) can be considered protagonists, they all represent opposing views on the value of human life. As the entire world holds its breath, the Watchmen simply wait, too conflicted and wary to take action. These Watchmen are no ordinary heroes. They are deeply flawed, complex, and extremely well-developed.As the script's storyline is really only a couple hours long, the film inter-cuts each individual of the Watchmen's past history to their present-day apprehension with the world on the brink of nuclear war. What makes this technique so effective is that unlike the average cinema superhero, the Watchmen are anything but super. What they really are are just washed-up retirees who have a little taste of nostalgia for who they used to be. And it isn't until this nuclear debacle that they found out who they really are.The only major criticism worth noting is the film's editing. Forget about ""Who Watches the Watchmen?"" Who watches the final cut? Watchmen's soundtrack is just all over the place. It likens to the product of what happens when a teenager and his friends make a home video on their very first video-editing program and add their favorite songs to layer the soundtrack. Individual songs in Watchmen's soundtrack are great, but the combination of these songs polishes this film with an unnecessary Hollywood glaze. Perhaps the editors and Snyder weren't quite on the same page.But Watchmen should be remembered for what makes it great instead. Granted, it is difficult to purely appreciate the film when it is incredibly uneven. With regard to the performances, for instance, some actors were really on (Jackie Earle Haley) while others were detrimental to the viewing experience (Malin Akerman). Certain parts in Watchmen are incredible while other parts are bound to just tick you off. And that's a damned shame for a movie with so many touches of greatness.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Needed to be a web series!,"This may be a controversial perspective, but it might have worked better as a web series. The enormous world building, a dozen people with equally important backstories, coupled with some terrific action and an emphasis on visual storytelling; I believe the whole proposal would have had more of an impact if it had been shaped and formed in a conventional web show format.I can't believe I'm saying this, but 'Three Hours' was inadequate to effectively employ its contextual complexity, ethical dilemmas, and numerous analogies. Even though the editing team did the best they could to keep everything under 180 minutes, the sheer scope of the source material necessitated additional space on screen.P. S. If I had to pick my favourite character from ""Watchmen,"" it would be ""Rorschach""; he nailed every scene from from start to finish. He piqued my curiosity with each situation! I would really like to see a spinoff focusing entirely on his individuality.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

so perfect I can't find words to describe it,"Watchmen is so good, I saw it three times already and I realize I have a Watchmen addiction I mean really it's so breathtaking every scene it's a movie that will break boundaries there violence, but that no so bad, because it's meant to be a story on itself, outside our society, in a different world but still I find many things that we nowadays share with Watchmen the music, for instance it's so good, so perfectly put together with the images on the screen my favourite movies are Scorpio Rising, Forrest Gump and Watchmen you see many people being hit at on this wonderful music okay the comic is cool too I don't disagree with that I just think that every living soul should see this movie it changed my life completely I'm very sorry I cannot be more specific on some scenes, but I don't want to pull the magic away before you've seen it yourselves the parts I don't like about Watchmen are details like the sex scene not the first one you see but the second it's on music that makes you laugh instead of tender oh I'm so mad at myself I don't find words to show the goodness of Watchmen let me put is thus: if I were king or somebody like a king, somebody with a lot of authority, I would make everybody see Watchmen but not only that I would say they all have to vote 10 on IMDb for this movie, so it can go back where it belongs: in the top 250!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Justice is coming to all of us. No matter what we do.,"An adaptation of Alan Moore's landmark comic book series, Watchmen is a story set in an alternative 1985, where the world is ticking closer to the brink of nuclear war, and a plot to eliminate a band of ex-crimefighters is instigated, but why? and by whom? It is up to two of those ex-crimefighters to investigate the plot that seems to go beyond the unthinkable.""Watchmen"" fell into traps. The first trap was a lawsuit from 20th Century Fox to Warner Bros. For better or worse, they negotiated a deal and had the film released in its appropriate date. The second trap is from the publicity itself. Now I'm sure many beloved fans would love to see the movie, and there's no reason to blame them. However, there are many other people who have never read the graphic novel in their entire life. However, that won't stop them because the marketing looked fantastic, the trailers and commercials showing cool, zesty special effects with some cool actions scenes all directed by the cool guy who did ""300,"" Zack Snyder.This is the downfall. What the marketing don't show is that the film is about three hours long, has very little to no action scenes, and it's very talky. Now why is that the problem? For those who haven't read the graphic novel, including myself, they'll be stuck in a, jumbled, incoherent piece of narrative that doesn't stop until the end. Throughout the movie, I wanted to kill myself, honestly. I was so tired by the first act that even I wouldn't have cared if the movie ended or not. It just wasn't interesting. And that's what many of you non-fans will suffer through the film.I'm not saying the movie is bad. It just appeals more to the fans than account to the others. Like I said, the movie is so very long and the pace is just uneven. Action scenes come up randomly just to keep the audience awake. Other elements that would keep them awake is the visually extensive look of the film. I must say, by technical standards, the movie looks fantastic, giving a noir-neo look. Just like ""300,"" Snyder would get every chance he has to milk some visually creative scenes for some time.When there are some action scenes, which won't be very many, they are done very well, to say the least. Like the rest of the film, the scenes are set up perfectly to bring out the best possible response from the audience. The music choice is very odd, though. Sometimes, they work well, like the opening sequence and other times, they're downright horrible. As for the performances themselves, nobody actually stood out for me. Many are saying Jackie Earle Haley did a good job, but I found him quite annoying with his ""Christian Bale-in-Batman-form-voice."" I found him very incomprehensible that I begged for subtitles to appear to understand what he's trying to say.Overall, the film was just confusing and incoherent. I wasn't interest at all of what's going on and who's going to die. When the plot does start to move, it's sometimes very predictable on what's going happen, which is pretty ironic because the film tries to be thought-provoking. Under the messy, uneven film, one can actually see it has little to nothing to say or that it didn't say anything different from previous superhero films that have been done before already. Director Snyder has a good eye, I'll give him that, but the rest of the film just falls down from a non-fan point of view. If you're not a fan, don't bother wasting your time. After all, it's almost three hours long. If you're a fan, go ahead and watch it. Enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
prepubescent drivel,"Knowing almost nothing about the book, the watchmen carried no biases or expectations. However, it was a painful, prepubescent, dark, shallow-pointless - an ultra violent spectacle driven mostly by slow plot development and over the top special effects and cursing.Certainly there IS a plot here but it moves quite slowly with purpose and symbolism somewhat lost even if you strip back the special effects and gore. Seemingly the plot tried draw on some kind of twisted reality built on simplistic references to American history even going as far as replicating famous faces such as Nixon, Dan Rather, and Kissenger. Instead of adding to the film, it only enhanced a feeling of pointless clutter.The super hero's looked like lame cheap knockoffs (except for the digital Dr. Manhatten) who went around glorifying violence (and murder) as they performed dark justice on anyone who was in their way. Sadly, even the slow motion Matrix-like fighting sequences (with an emphasis on gore) seemed to be begging for attention.As the plot dragged on and on, it sadly turned me into the watchman of the digital clock on my cell phone - Eventually I walked out of the theater after about 1 hour of trying to say interested.In the end, I was left with an empty feeling one might get from an emptying and entire bag of greasy popcorn - and like the movie, something probably only enjoyed without recourse by a teenager. I would recommend that you watch for the DVD.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Faultless,"Let's get this out of the way now - Watchmen the movie is better than the graphic novel. And I know I'm going to be slated for daring to say it. But in my defence I have to add I first read the graphic novel twenty years ago and have been a very big fan ever since.The characterisation was absolutely spot on for all the major players and a great deal of attention went into capturing the essence of each and even surpassing this in some cases. One of those cases being the greatest character of them all: Rorschach. Jackie Earle Haley was absolutely superb in the role and utterly convinced as the flawed anti-hero whose every action was a the worn like a bloody heart on his sleeve. Billy Crudrup was perfect as the understated big blue giant, Malin Akerman's Silk Spectre was just as I imagined her from the page, even down to the perfect look, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan's Comedian did a fantastic job showing us the depth of possibly the deepest character in the whole film and almost pulled off some pity for the man too. Add to all of this excellent cinematography, pace, direction and not forgetting the soundtrack you have a film I cannot fault.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Review of Watchmen,"I think I may have had too much of a biased opinion when I saw this film, because I had just finished reading the graphic novel, which I do recommend. So plot wise I knew everything that was going to happen and all the little fussy details were still fresh in my mind. Yet, it is unfair to say that a movie must follow every detail of its former medium, because that would just be pointless. This movie disappointed me in other ways.For one, it was too short and because of that they rushed things: Important story elements like Dr. Mahnhattan's perception on time, Rorscach's back story (or any character back story, it is so important to the over riding theme of who superheroes really would be should they actually exist), why the alternate history really happened the way it did, and so on. I feel like it was a bit hard to follow for someone who never ever read the novel.Also, there was some cheesy dialog with some surface acting, but it is forgivable I suppose.It was beautifully shot, the crew was very creative and effective especially in the beginning. Soundtrack is wonderful. And there are other entertaining perks, like Silk Spectre whooping some ACE in prison dressed up in a skin tight outfit, lots of Sin City/300esque violence, and others.In short, I feel like the biggest fault of this movie was that they had to make it short, and at nearly three hours that is saying something about the original work's depth, and dumbed it down for the general audience. Oh well what can you expect? They have to make money somehow, and that they did.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Faithful Adaptation that lacks any soul of the original,"Watchmen is, in many ways, a faithful, even loving adaptation of Alan Moore's graphic novel. Zack Snyder reproduces many of the scenes, especially early in the film, almost ""shot for shot"" from the book. Most of the major plot points from the book, at least those involving the main characters, make it into the movie. The things which were edited from the book: longer sequences of Rorschach, Veidt, and Silk Specter's pasts, the plot lines with supporting characters, the black freighter sequences, largely make a certain kind of sense as the things you'd cut. Snyder also does an excellent job of establishing the mood of the alternate history and the backstory of the superheroes through a great opening credits montage.But... the film lacks any real soul. None of the performances stand out. Matthew Goode manages to make Ozymandias more human than he is in the book, at least until the end. Jackie Earle Haley has a moment of snarling greatness near the end, but that's about it. Patrick Wilson brings nothing to the role of Night Owl, and Billy Crudup's tepid delivery harms the portrayal of Dr Manhattan. Snyder's editing out of the secondary characters, while making sense in regards to running time, ultimately blunts the impact of the films climax. Furthermore, Snyder is obviously of rather juvenile sensibilities when it comes to storytelling. While he's cut out many moments of character development he actually INCREASES the time allotted to violence. The book is not actually that violent and most of the more gruesome acts happen off camera. In Snyder's Watchmen we're treated to extremely gory disintegrations and extended slow-mo fight scenes which serve to show off his cool camera technology but do nothing to advance the film. There's also two instances where Snyder takes lines from the book and rather than having them delivered by the actual character, has them delivered as heresay by another one. In the final case this dramatically blunts one of the central messages of the film, ultimately making the line just an offhanded quip. Oddly, given the apocalyptic ending, the film really has no emotional payoff.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A deeply human adaptation,"As a huge fan of the graphic novel, I have to say that Zack Snyder has done about as good a job with this movie adaptation as was humanly possible. Yes, some elements were left out, but the omissions were wisely chosen. Yes, a few elements were modified. But again, the changes were done with enormous care and intelligence. In at least one case - the ending - I felt the film's (quite minor) modification was arguably superior to Alan Moore's original version. (It eliminates one factor that really has no other point of contact in the story, and substitutes a new irony that I think Moore himself might have appreciated.)What really won me over, though, was the human element. The largely unknown actors chosen to portray The Comedian, Night Owl, Silk Specter II and Rorschach not only look *uncannily* like the characters in the comic, they do an excellent job of fleshing them out. Carla Gugino deserves special note for her great portrayal of the aging Silk Specter I, and Matt Frewer is absolutely perfect as Moloch. And Billy Crudup handles the vague and disinterested Dr Manhattan with just the right subtlety. All of these actors deliver performances that are appropriately stylized, yet deeply human; they bring these characters to life for me in a way that static images on a page simply cannot.Largely because of this, I found that the movie quickly won me over. Not only as a worthwhile illumination of the comic book, but as a credible work in its own right. At first, I kept comparing each scene with its comic-book equivalent; but after about twenty minutes, I was swept up by the film and felt almost as though I were watching an entirely new creation.Visually, Watchmen does stay very close to Gibbons' original illustrations, but without being slavish about it. Scenes are allowed to flow and move cinematically, much more than in previous comic adaptations such as Sin City and Snyder's own 300. This really brings the comic to life and opens it up for the big screen, while leaving Gibbons' strange color palette and peculiar compositions clearly evident.Reading previous reviews, I sense disappointment from those who were seeking a slam-bang ""superhero"" movie, akin to Dark Knight or Spider-Man. Of course, nothing could possibly have been further from Alan Moore's darkly cynical vision. Watchmen isn't about the action itself, but the motives behind it - something largely taken for granted by superhero comics. When these 'heroes' go into action, we're meant to not just feel their exhilaration, but also to question the brooding subconscious desires that drive it. (Not to mention the urges that fuel our own vicarious enjoyment.) What if 'The Dark Knight' *wasn't* pure in spirit, but was tainted by the same perverse passions that we see in ourselves? Unlike the Wachowski Brothers' superficial interpretation of ""V for Vendetta,"" Snyder's Watchmen deserves credit for ducking none of Moore's toughest, most unsettling questions.The original remains the original, of course. Everyone should read Moore and Gibbons' masterpiece. But while Snyder's Watchmen may shine largely with borrowed brilliance, it does shine very brightly indeed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Extremely underrated, very faithful adaptation and probably one of the greatest superhero movies of all time!","I honestly cannot believe how underrated Watchmen is.It did not make a profit during it's theatrical release(though it did pretty good).It also seems to have a lot of haters on the IMDb forums.The reviews were mixed.I think it's one of those movies you will have to watch more than once.It has a fairly complicated storyline and I got lost at times when I saw it.However, overall I enjoyed the movie greatly.I picked up the original 1986 graphic novel and have since finished reading it.It was a bit better than the film, but just a bit! Director Zack Snyder made a very faithful adaptation to a comic deemed ""unfilmable"".Yes the ending has changed and there are some other things missing(though these might be included in the extended cuts of the film to be released on DVD).The ""Black Freighter"" & newsstand scenes are gone(though I didn't much care for the black freighter parts), there are also a few other changes.The film is also more violent than the novel.The plot of the film starts off with a superhero named ""The Comedian"" getting brutally beaten and thrown through a window.Then a masked vigilante named ""Rorshach"" investigates his murder, while warning his old superhero friends.The rest of the film involves flashbacks of the superheroes, showing how the 1977 Keene act banned vigilantism forcing the heroes into retirement, as well as a romance between Nite-Owl and Silk Spectre(two other heroes).Watchmen is an unconventional superhero movie.Do not compare it to ""Dark Knight"" or ""Spider-Man"".It's bloody, R-rated, thought provoking and not for young kids.This is another reason why people did not like it, they didn't know what to expect.Anyway, the film is a must for fans of the graphic novel.Others might probably enjoy the thought provoking superhero film.There is quite a bit of action as well!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Parents, be aware! Watchmen is no kids' movie!","Wow, am I ever impressed with how superhero films have been lately! I mean, we kicked off summer 2008 with Iron Man (which was excellent), the comical action movie ''Hancock'' then we had one of the most visually impressive movie I have ever seen (Hellboy 2: The Golden Army), the outstanding and incredible ''Dark Knight'', the very good (I'm not talking excellent quality, but just some good, old, explosive fun) Punisher: War Zone. The Incredible Hulk, while not outstanding, wasn't bad and now we have this movie, Watchmen. And besides The Dark Knight, Watchmen topples all of the movies I named, and by far. Not only is it excessively visually impressive, but it is another creative take on the darker side of the superhero genre.If you have seen Zack Snyder's breakout films, which are Dawn of the Dead (the 2004 film, which has got to be the best remake out there) or 300 (another piece of visual quality), then you probably know what to expect from Watchmen. So while this is a superhero movie, please note (if you are a parent), that Watchmen has it's load of graphic, gory violence, profanity, and shots of blue Dr. Manhattan penises and and of actress Malin Akerman's breasts. Please also be aware that it's based off a graphic novel, and not a comic book. This doesn't matter much to some people, but to me, it's like comparing a Spider-Man or a Superman comic with the excessively violent Sin City, which was later turned into a movie rated ''R'', and earned a 16+ rating in my province. I was in a room with a lot of parents with young children, and there were scenes I was shocked to see young children in the theater room, and believe it or not, some parent dragged his son home before the attempted rape scene with The Comedian and Sally Jupiter. However, while not a children movie, it is more than just a delight for the older viewer.I won't do a plot summary for this one, as I am scared to give out spoilers, but I will undeniably speak of the artistic quality. The actors were not excellent, just Okay, with perhaps the exception of Billy Crudup (Dr. Manhattan), Jackie Earle Hayley (Rorschach) and Jeffery Dean Morgan (the Comedian), but the visual effects steal the show. Zack Snyder uses again the same slow-motion action as in 300, and believe me, it never gets old. The script is also good quality. It shows us an alternative version of the United States where Snyder and the scriptwriters question themselves on how the History of America would have been if superheroes would have lived with us since the 1940's. Thus, we are shown many events of the American History, transformed with intelligent and creative, yet accurately false depictions of the Vietnam War, or the assassination of JFK to name a few.Go ahead, people, spend your money. It is rare a movie as visually impressive as Watchmen is released.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Just let it be surreal violence. Don't pretend it's something more.,"Violence has always been the source of entertainment whether we are talking about movies or video games. The dramatic change occurred when the the people of today, apathetically feeding out of entertainment, actually found violence without drama or philosophical bases boring and insulting. That was when we started to have movies that were/are made for people wanting to see that usual content but which were this time filled up with more intellectual stuff. Watchmen is one of these examples.Judging from the evolving level of our current society here, I have always assumed that we know where violence stands. Entertainment is entertainment and I respect that. To each his own. Taking a look at the director Zack Snyder's previous two films you can easily predict how the film is going to be. That was what I did. I expected to see lots of physical harm, limbs moving around or something similar and got prepared for it. So, why had they seen so much trouble trying to make the movie be more than physical harm, limbs moving around or something when it clearly was about that?When you have two people hitting themselves for almost a minute, don't try pretending the fight itself wasn't your interest. There is a difference between violence that is the part of a bigger story and violence that is just there for itself.The final indication of this movie's true target audience is the way they handled the philosophy. Every time I could have had something to think by myself, the characters in the movie explained those things to me so fundamentally that all I needed to do was drool. Maybe the scriptwriters knew that the ethical questions were too hard to be just visually presented to the audience for pondering.Positively, this movie did feel somewhat refreshing, maybe because of it's surreal content and it's tone changing ridiculously often. I don't think this movie is the best example of an action movie desperately trying to pass off as a serious masterpiece. If you want better alternatives of those, you can go see Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.So, how will you enjoy this movie? Just put popcorn in your mouth, let your brain cells go and try to ignore the fact that you might be deluded to actually use them during the movie.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

I felt as if I had been given the closest thing to the Sin-City experience I had years ago. The violence was seminal, the gore welcome. The characters brilliantly played (all hail Rorshach!) As for camera-work, what words can suffice! It was artistic and hit every right note as with 300. The color, texture and balance as though carefully and obsessively picked to be beyond our expectations. The camera fulfilled my every desire. As for the music, I'll never hear the song Hallelujah and feel the same way again! Zack Snyder has given me faith in filmmakers.

Who watches their watch during a movie?,"""Who watches the 'Watchmen'?"" I'm sure a couple of hundred of thousands will the first week. Maybe a few more when the 'Watchmen' gets released in a few months on DVD. Between that time, I doubt many will.It's got the unfortunate (about) 3 hour time frame (and believe me, you'll feel every minute of those 163 minutes) and the ""not-for-kids""/hard R superhero movie violence, profanity and nudity against it. Whereas 'The Dark Knight' was probably the most adult, real-life super-hero movie, 'Watchmen' really, really wants to be an adult super-hero movie. Almost like a 13-year-old comic book-geek wishing he was older.Visually stunning in some scenes, enormously graphic in others, 'Watchmen' isn't a terrible movie; it just simply tries too hard. Maybe it tried too hard to put all of its source material in the stand-alone film. Granted, I never read the original comics/graphic novel, so this is all from an outside POV. But I see now why 'Stephen King's The Stand' made its way to the small screen instead. (And I did read that original novel.) Basically, 'Watchmen' disguises itself as film noir, setting itself all over the place from the 1940s to present day/alternate 1985 (reminds me of another alternate 1985 in 'Back to the Future Part II,' as did their version of multiple-elected Nixon reminded me of older Biff in the same film. This absolutely made me laugh whenever Nixon was on the screen. I'm not sure if that was intended, but it certainly was distracting.) Half the time, I had a hard time keeping up with past, future, most recent past; I finally gave up, reminding myself to sort it out later.It's really just a mystery of who's killing off the superheroes and why. Unfortunately, it starts off that way, and then you almost have to wait the other 150 minutes or so to get back to the plot A. Plots B, C, D, etc are almost forgettable and at times slow. Sure, they seemed to know when it was slow, as they immediately threw in someone getting chopped, sliced, and murdered with a loud action sequence.I liked the visuals, the style and a multiple super-hero movie with characters they either did explain how they became super-human, or simply left as a mystery. The not knowing sometimes was even better. However, this is the same fear I have for the long-delayed 'Justice League' movie: 12 or so origin-stories, a 12-hour movie makes. I certainly couldn't take even 15 more minutes in this film to figure out how one character's mask shifts.And I did like two of the characters: The Comedian and Rorschach (though when behind the ink, or eventually unmasked, is dead-on for a young Clint Eastwood.) Their interesting presence actually made me sit up and pay attention.Unfortunately, the movie had to deal with other characters. Some so laughable, we ended back up with the mind of the 13-year-old nerd who thought these up when doodling during History class.We had the world's smartest man, who never said one intelligent thing or had any sort of a brilliant idea. We had a girl in spandex (tell me she wasn't thought up by a 13-year-old boy) who's main powers are, well, uh, dressing nice, slow-mo hair and some karate from the movies. We had a dumbed-down Iron Man/Batman who was about as interesting as pocket lent.And finally, we have Dr. Manhattan. A very, very naked Dr. Manhattan. Though this didn't offend me and I absolutely appreciated this adaptation wasn't trying to shield its audience dropping its level to PG-13 status. But, come-on, I haven't seen this much full frontal male nudity since, well, never in the theater. When I saw 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall,' I definitively heard the male audience wince at the roughly 12-seconds (in the entire film) of Jason Segel's penis. I can't wait to hear the fanboy's reaction to male genitalia roughly every 4-5 scenes.But enough about his smurf-blue penis. His character was mildly interesting, but what frustrated me about 'Lord of the Rings' is the same in 'Watchmen.' Whenever there's a character with basically omnipotent power, the solution to solving all of Earth's (or Middle Earth's) problems seems so clear and no one seems to want or thinks to use such power. How about wiping out the Earth's nuclear bombs with a single thought (or just blinking that ring to that volcano)? Yes, I realize there's a lot of ""learning"" to do and it would end up as a 15-minute short film given my solution. But given I have little patience, a 3 hour (or 9 with 'Rings') movie probably wasn't suited for me anyways.The music was loud, overbearing and too much of an 80s homage. The dialogue, at times, was hilariously bad. And when the twist is revealed in the closing, I almost laughed (again, probably unintentionally) on how everyone went on as if nothing happened.'Watchmen' is worth a watch, but I should've just wanted the couple of months for DVD. I certainly needed several breaks. Heck, even 'Lord of the Rings' let a year pass between ""learning"" sessions so you can recoup.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Watching The Watchmen,"Watchmen is a rare film and because of that it may scare off some looking for the usual superhero fare. Watchmen packs in a lot in its two hours and forty minutes so it never feels too long or boring. The film is densely plotted and original. Give director Zak Snyder (300, the 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead) credit for turning Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons graphic novel into a film; the project had been long gestating since the late 80's. Terry Gilliam was set to direct at one point but ultimately deemed it to be ""unfilmable"".According to many Snyder's vision of Watchmen is faithful. Not having read the novel I have to believe they are probably right. Snyder did not seem to want to compromise the integrity of the project. At one point, the studio was in talks with Snyder to make it PG-13 but ultimately Snyder decided it wasn't going to work. Snyder has also said that he is going to add an hour for the DVD and Blu-ray version of the release.Now on to the film itself, The Watchmen meets and exceeds expectations. The film is set in an alternate reality of the US in 1985. Nixon just won his 5th term in office and the US is in a cold war with Russia and nuclear war is all but on the brink. Masked vigilantes have been part of the culture since the 40's the first group was called the Minutemen and we get a brief synopsis of what happened to them. The latest group are The Watchmen. Some of the Watchmen don't don their masks and fight crime anymore as superheroes are now made illegal. Some decide that its still their obligation. Did I mention someone is trying to kill off superheroes? This brings the group back together. The movie has a lot going on including a very involved mythology which is very engrossing. The film is very satisfying and will leave you discussing and thinking about the film for a long while. Very highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
amazingly done from the edge-of-your-seat beginning to the groundbreaking end,"the first time i saw the trailer for this movie i was mesmerized, i'd never even heard of the graphic novel let alone read it, i still haven't read it but i think that the movie was excellent from start to finish, the story and script were so well written and the actors delivered perfectly, the special effects were to drool over, and the action was no-holds-barred, the movie was slow at times but you never want nothing but violence, it seemed like every scene was important some how, and most importantly it kept your interest, you watch spider-man and daredevil and they fought the bad guys just like you want to see, but the watchmen had no mercy, some might say that Rorshach and the Comedian were sadistic but i think that every thing they did just added to there character and every scene whether it be a sex scene or a violent scene graphic as it may be was another great addition to the characters, the actors turned in a great performance in what is possibly the best movie based on a graphic novel, so thats why i gave it a 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Zack Snyder's Finest,"One of the greatest adaptations of a graphic novel and undeniably amongst the most thematically rich examples in the comic-book genre, Watchmen renders on screen what was once considered unfilmable by many and is a deftly layered, unflinchingly bold & thoroughly captivating deconstruction of superheroes. No less than a groundbreaking achievement, the film is destined to polarise some but it is also assured of a devoted cult following. In short, this visually arresting blend of filmmaking art & popcorn entertainment remains Zack Snyder's finest film to date.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

read the book and then saw it (please don't listen to negative critics),"Me and 10 friends went to see it. 3 had read the novel including myself and loved it. 3 hated it because they went in with high expectations and the rest were neutral. it wasn't hard to follow, but without the subplots like in the novel it was hard for people who haven't read it to follow. except for the end when it was all given away. The long running time does not help this. most people will see the movie before reading the novel. those who haven't seen it I suggest not going in thinking its a who done it movie or its going to be like 300 or it's going to blow you away with something new. It is something new but it won't blow you away. watch, then get your hands on a copy of the novel and then leave your comments if you feel the director did a bad job etc. I think Zack Snyder did well to follow the novel, add his little extras and try and make it appealing to those who haven't read it. with so many super hero movies out and coming out I'm not surprised people where disappointed. they got something completely opposite to what there used to seeing. Will it flop? I don't think so, I just hope that too many people do not let themselves be persuaded by critics leaving negative comments.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Dark, sweet treat...","Why does the one well-written, but extremely negative review of a great movie always get picked for the main page? Trolling...?I did not read the graphic novel, so I could hardly be called a fan-boy... but I still loved this movie. You will too, provided you are up for deeply flawed, comic book superheroes running around in an alternate reality circa 1980's U.S.Beware, the film richly deserves it's R rating for brutal violence, fairly graphic sex scenes, and some full frontal nudity. This film is no place for children (or squeamish adults)... but if you've seen (and still enjoyed) movies like ""Kill Bill"" or ""Sin City"", you won't be too shocked.There's a rich, gritty back story to each of these characters, told in flashback. Despite what some have said, I did not find this confusing at all. This is a sweeping tale which required masterful storytelling which was done seamlessly. I loved the nostalgic pastels and fashions of bygone eras in the retro scenes.If you're still intent on seeing this movie, do NOT wait for the DVD. This is a sweeping tale that makes for a jaw-dropping film and it really must be experienced on the big screen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Closest I have come to leaving a theater,"This movie was no where near what myself or my husband expected. We are both big graphic novel fans and were sorely disappointed. The sound effects were overkill, the special effects were added for no reason at all (eg.. clock building on Mars?), the story tried to follow to many plot lines and it got to three quarters of the way through the movie and you're not sure where you are because there's so many stories that are so poorly attempted. The director has tried to give it this violent dark feel but its just violence for the sake of violence. Its not clever like a Tarintino film and makes sense, its just gore. Big waste of a film budget. I was so bored in it I was wondering in one scene how many children could have been fed by the waste of money that used for that scene.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Review from both sides of the viewer,"Fanboys beware... You won't like this review... OK, so here's what happened, I've been a comic book fan for a long time, but I never got my hands on 'Watchmen' I did know how important it was, I did know who Alan Moore was and I did know some college professors even made a textbook out of this graphic novel but I never got a chance to read it.So I went to see it knowing what I knew and couldn't got out of the theater more happy, confused and depressed... I know, weird.Just like the graphic novel set out to do, the movie took everything I knew about superheroes and threw it out the window, with heroes breaking bones, killing, raping, maiming, etc. and not just criminals!The human side of it all, so to speak. Then I came back home, thought about it and finally got my hands on the graphic novel and then I watched the movie again and wow... they really made a home run with that movie... the adaptation was incredibly loyal and the ending was better! (I felt the squid in the graphic novel was anti-climatic and didn't made sense for Dr. Manhattan to leave earth, fanboys, begin to bash...) Truth be told I hated 300, but Zack Snyder really got it right with this one, the acting, the photography, the costumes, all of it!I was more intrigued by the Nite Owl character than any other (even Rorschach) and loved the costume! how come it took a non-batman movie to finally make a decent-cool looking-realistic Batman costume!? the hood came off easily (just like batman's comic book suit does) non of that magic marker around the eyes, it didn't looked like his agility was compromised by the suit and it looked sweeter than any costume in any batman movie ever! (fanboys, continue bashing...) So all in all this is a good movie, if you didn't read the graphic novel you may have to watch this movie two or three times, the second time around you will enjoy it more since you know what it is about and the 3rd time you will notice things you didn't notice before (very few movies do that) Also so few comic book movies deserve an Oscar for best adaptation...Watchmen is a theatrical experience that if it's not recognized it will regain immediate cult status, either way this movie will remain deep in the hearts of this and many generations to come.$0.02",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A non comic reader's take on it,"I'm not much of a comic reader and as far as I know before watching, the story was about a bunch of super heroes. After watching, I can say that I enjoyed it a lot. It's not like any other super hero movie. Unlike other super hero movies where the action is the actual star of the movie, Watchmen has it's story and characters to thank for in making it what it is.Each leading character has dimensions to them. These are not your standard super hero do gooders. The movie manages to portray them as humans with flaws and all. It's amazing how the movie manages to present so much character development for so many characters, and do it so effectively. At the end of the movie, you feel as if you actually understand these characters' motivation and why they became are who they are.And the movie's ""feel"" suits the story too. It's very dark story-wise and the cinematography together with the choice of music really contribute a lot in achieving the tone that the movie has. Overall, a very well crafted and original movie that delves into a world where super heroes are very real.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

An okay attempt at adapting one of the greatest graphic novels of all time,"The 1986 graphic novel was amazing due to its depth, complexity, darkness, it being timeless, and its realistic attempt at the superhero genre.The 2009 movie, is good on its own, but only because it copied the graphic novel, but just did it worse. The dialogue, story, and even some of the imagery is ripped straight on of the novel. The movie is a faithful adaption, but none of the credit can be given to the movie. This movie has depth, is dark, and complex, but not nearly as the same level as the novel. Any of the themes you can find is just a result of the script that was copied from the book. Something that it doesn't copy from the book is the action. The fighting is brutal, violent, and fun to watch, but extremely unrealistic. It misses the point that the story is supposed to be realistic. The ending, which I won't spoil, is a lot worse, and doesn't really resolve any problems the way it was supposed to. Overall, almost anything good about the movie is just copied from the graphic novel, and everything else it does is just bad. If you haven't read the book, the movie gives no effort for you don't understand or enjoy what's going on.The directing, cinematography, and visuals are amazing, but the acting is very mediocre at some moments.The movie is okay, and worth a watch if you've read the graphic novel, but if you haven't, just read the book.

"Great movie, demanding, uncompromising like Rorschach","I swear I must have been in a black hole of comic fandom in 1985! After the movie was announced last year, I sheepishly avoided questions about having read the book. (I had not!) Then all copies of the graphic novel that I had missed sold out or skyrocketed in price! As soon as a reprint came out I picked one up and read through it. So the book and movie is quite fresh with me. I thought both were excellent. Watchmen doesn't pull any punches and is largely faithful to the book. Zack Snyder and Dave Gibbons did a fantastic job bringing Watchmen to the screen. Like Rorschach, the movie does not compromise.But that could be a detriment for some. It's a movie by fans for fans. While fans will love Watchmen, it may be a mystery for the initiated. People who don't like comics may not get it. The good news is that those people are now in the minority! In 1985, when Watchmen was published, the first mainstream comic movies, Superman and Batman had just been made.Watchmen is a deliriously complicated puzzle of a story. Tough to do in a film! Watchmen succeeds brilliantly without taking itself seriously. Rorschach, Dr. Manhattan and The Comedian are easily the most complex characters in any graphic novel and could have fallen out of the pages of a Dostoevsky novel. The brilliant acting treatment given to them by Jackie Earle Haley, Billy Crudup, Jeffrey Dean Morgan is really top notch and certainly carried the film. The film is well worth watching for Jackie Earle Haley alone. The look is glorious as well. The Artist Dave Gibbons was very involved with the film and in most places it follows the book panel by panel. Sure there were a few changes, but nothing untrue to the spirit of the novel.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Too close to the comic for its own good,"THE GOOD: Watchmen does 90% of everything it tries right. It's beautiful, intelligent, well-acted and beautiful again. Rorschach is AMAZING and Dr. Manhatten is spot on. Most of the dialog, often word-for-word from the comic (yes, sorry, graphic novel), is razor sharp, and the plot, while imperfect, is still head and shoulders above the norm.Unfortunately, the 10% it does wrong is probably the stuff that will stick with you.THE BAD: I respect Snyder for his determination to follow the comic to the letter, I really do, but he has to learn when to step back and let a movie stand on its own feet. For example: the story could and should have been restructured to avoid the cluster-bomb of flashbacks crammed into the first hour. And Bubastis seriously had to go.Then there's the terrible, embarrassing-to-the-point-of-movie-damaging porno scene dead smack in the middle. Why!? If there was ONE place to stick with the comic (where this scene is short and tasteful) this was it.Finally, the sound track is distracting. It's not that the songs are bad, but the placement, volume and arrangement of said songs makes it all too clear that many are only here for commercial tie-ins. There are of course exceptions (loved the intro and the comedian's funeral).Overall Watchmen is an achievement in many ways. It's not perfect (nor was the comic to be honest), but it's damn good. Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Good but not great. Very faithful though.,"Well, the big day is finally here, and we've all been waiting for various amounts of time for the film adaption of the popular comic book spectacle known only as Watchmen. Made by the so-called visionary director of recent cinematic borefest 300, this movie was obviously a big target on everybody's radar, and I wasn't sure what to think of it - how could anyone, let alone Zack Snyder, make a film adaption of a book as layered, complex and involving as Watchmen? The answer to that question is, they took the easiest way out and just made the movie scene-for-scene with the book. Not a bad idea in the end, although there were a few minor changes. I'm quite frankly surprised how much fun this was to watch.I think the main draw here for the comic-book fans is the number of not-so-subtle nods to them in the way that the movie really did pull most of the scenes here right out of the book, dialogue and all. I mean, word for word, seriously. The most shocking part of this to me, aside from the abysmal opening sequence and the stupidly gory fight scene in the allyway, was the Dr. Manhattan soliloquy on the moon, which was actually pretty much carried out in full, flashbacks and all. Rorschach's journal is vocalized a lot of the time, too, and I kind of expected that. The flashbacks are all done with high regard to the novel, and a lot of the time I was just sort of nodding my head along with it, as the book was still fresh in my memory and none of it really surprised me.The violence was heavy, bloody and dark as Hell, and I was much more entertained here than I was watching big, beefy men with no shirts on sloooooowly stab each other to death in...you know, that other movie. Like I said, the beginning is silly, with the violence being kind of pointless and very poorly constructed, but after that it gets better. The scenery is awe-inspiring, with huge, bright, vivid landscapes filled with shadows and intricate details and everything else that's just icing on the cake. Just look at the city streets; V for Vendetta wishes it looked that good. And the scenes on Mars...holy hell! The costume designs, too, are all amazing, and it's a slap in the face to other comic book films that they made everyone look so much like they did in the original book. I mean...aside from Ozymandias, they look like they jumped right out of Alan Moore's graphic novel.Okay, so enough book comparisons, how was the movie as a movie? Well, this was very long, very detailed, and very over the top in every aspect. The explosions are loud, and they're bright, too; I had to cover my eyes a few times. The story is told in a very jumpy comic-book-esquire format, which is no surprise, although honestly I would have preferred a totally different adaption by a smart director like Chris Nolan instead. Everything moves fast, so fast that it gives the illusion of the movie being shorter than it is (and also being ironic in the way that 300 dragged more than a car with flat tires). The story is very stylized and charismatic, with the use of several songs during the ""bigger"" moments that I actually liked a lot; they added an extra special something to the movie that I found charming and invigorating, even. Not something I'd like to see in every movie, but it works surprisingly excellently in this one. And yes, Dr. Manhattan's speech does get a bit tedious - working only in the book format, apparently; a direct copy-paste of the novel dialogue to a cinematic form is not a good idea - but for newcomers, I imagine it will at least be interesting to listen to, if not too long. And the great special effects will even keep the comic fans watching.The ending is quite a spectacle, with a new bit added in that I found quite cool; won't spoil it, though. It is a lot darker in some ways, a lot lighter in others, and more Hollywood-ized, and I found that it worked. Watchmen is about as good of a straight-ahead comic book adaption as we'll get these days, so far at least, and although it is not perfect, I found it extremely entertaining and definitely worth re-watching. It isn't particularly life-changing, lacking most of the gravity and weight of the novel, but it is a provocative, interesting look at superhero films, and those who have never experienced the novel before will be in for a real treat.

Let's do a slow pace dark movie about superheroes and hope it's art,"This is one of the worst films I've seen recently. It starts with a nice action scene, well done, nice fx... And then it just goes DOWN. And when you think it couldn't get any lower, it DOES, and when it's at the bottom it goes even more deep... After all that, it has a very nice ending. Off course that doesn't justify the almost 3 hours I lost getting bored there; because the end of the movie could have been placed in a very different film. I have to say that almost all the dialogs are just plain stupid. Some people say that THIS is what superhero movies should be like... I think there is no point in doing such ""realistic"" characters and situations if it can only bore you. I prefer 1000 times over this movies like X-MEN or BATMAN. This movie feels like ""I want to do some artistic stuff with something that isn't supposed to be art..."" It could have been a good idea, but it was just a waste. Luckily it's gonna be out of Top 250 any time soon.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"In my opinion, movie adaptations are a highly overrated phenomenon","The beauty of the graphic novel, as Alan Moore and David Gibbons were clearly well aware when they crafted possibly the finest work of its medium in the original Watchmen, are its visuals. The best examples can layer countless clues, leitmotifs and intelligent details into their frames that would take pages to cover in a normal book.So in that spirit, allow me to sum up this review with one distinct mental image - Watchmen the Graphic Novel is the sweet over-sized cake. The cinematic medium is the undersized box. It's a testament to Zack Snyder's ability as a blockbuster director that he just about manages to squeeze the cake in, for the most part, intact - the taste is there, there's enough to satisfy one's appetite, but don't expect the edges to be smooth or for it to look like it did in the catalogue.Okay, a little vague perhaps - allow me to elaborate. Watchmen the Graphic Novel has long been considered unfilmable. Terry Gilliam turned it down. Alan Moore's opposition to an adaptation has been vehement and well-documented. On the evidence of the final product, they were right - what made it to the final cut is very much a mangled Watchmen.Character backstory is cut right back, sometimes even rushed - Rorschach's past, given a whole chapter to breathe in the GN, is cut down to one brief flashback. Veidt's, the poor bastard, is reduced to a PR speech. Only Dr Manhattan and The Comedian's curriculum vitaes make the transition with great aplomb - the former's four-dimensional flashback is brilliant, bordering on art cinema with its impeccably edited glimpses into Jon Osterman's past.The cast of nobodies and vaguely-recognisable-faces helps to keep the 'comic-on-film' feel of the whole thing - there's no denying that would be lost if we had Sigourney Weaver in a yellow jumpsuit, as opposed to The Girl Who Played Some Boobs in Harold and Kumar Get The Munchies. But equally few of the performances stick out - imagine how the comic sounded in your head, and that's a bit like how this feels. The exceptions are Jackie Earl Halley's monotonous Rorschach (who's badly-in-need-of-a-Locket throat-growling just about stays the right side of Christian Bale's Batman) and a surprisingly brilliant performance from Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian, who's as brilliant at being the refreshingly charming macho man's-man as he is on the brink of tears (in a moment of rare genuine emotion).Key scenes in the GN are almost glossed over completely, which in a work that pays such relentless lip service to its source material leaves the whole thing feeling a little disjointed - the climax, after so much build, seems almost like an afterthought, and the fates of two key characters in the graphic novel get nothing but a passing cameo, making the whole thing feel a bit pointless. Oh, and whilst we're discussing the ending, that big point of contention with the fans - Snyder's new take works. Just.Perhaps most bizarrely of all is the contribution of the soundtrack guy - it's a testament to the top-notch work a good soundtrack man can do that few reviews will ever need to point out when it works. In Watchmen it doesn't, and some of his picks veer from the flaming obvious to the downright bizarre. Case in point: the overlong sex scene to Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah. Evidence B: Laurie's moving reunion with old friend Dan Dreiberg to Nena's 99 Red Balloons. Sometimes it feels a bit like someone on the production team spent a boozy weekend with a couple of compilation CDs - in all fairness, when it hits it hits well, as seen in the stunning opening montage set to Dylan's 'The Times They Are A-Changing' (in a sly wink to the fans that would take far too much time to explain).On the bright side, and continuing with this somewhat strained analogy, there are moments when our cake is positvively enlivened by its box. The visuals are spot-on, the colour palette is bold and pleasingly walks the line between cartoony and gritty realism. The action sequences, if laden with a little too much unnecessary slow-mo and at times bizarrely inappropriate, are well executed, clear, and entertaining. The editing is superb (a staple of Snyder's films thus far).Most importantly of all, it's a truly original work - there has never been a film quite like Watchmen before, and whilst it isn't entirely successful, it packs a stiff kidney punch to a genre still reeling from the blow Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight dealt it. It's a long way from perfect, but it is important - it's the mark of a genre maturing, zits and all.So, got the idea now? If nothing else in this tenuous cake analogy we've learned that sometimes it's better to keep certain things in their own boxes. Be they comic frames or otherwise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Who Watches the Watchmen? I DO!,"This was one of the BEST super-hero movies I have EVER seen! I have read the graphic novel and when I went to see the movie I had some idea of what to expect but even then this great movie managed to make my jaw drop! Never have I seen a movie that is actually ""true"" to its source! Everything in the novel was faithfully reproduced on screen, from Dr. Manhattan's glowing blue visage to Rorschach's shifting mask...it's all there! The acting of this feature was simply superb. The best by far was Jackie Earle Hayley as the murderous, cold-hearted Rorschach. He took the comic-book character and gave him a face-lift like no other. His raspy voice and intimidating appearance was all that was needed to bring this amazing character to the screen. His costume was picture perfect and reminded me of those film-noir detectives of the old days that spent their time solving mysteries in the dead of night. Rorschach is no exception to this as he is the only one to take action and figure out what is going wrong with the world.The other characters all had their two cents as well. Nite Owl II was great and true to his comic book roots. Silk Spectre II will no doubt be the source of every young man's wet dreams...talk about sexy...WOW! Malin Akerman was absolutely STUNNING! I even enjoyed the Comedian as well...his gruff attitude and scarred face are what set him apart from the other Watchmen. I also highly enjoyed Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup). He was incredibly well-made through the dazzling art of computer animation and he seemed very real in my eyes. Speaking of eyes...I loved Dr. Manhattan's pupil-less glowing eyes. Very cool.As with most action-y movies, this one is loaded with it. Violence abounds and there is even a steamy scene between Nite Owl and Silk Spectre II. Rorschach too provides a good dose of blood and gore. Chopping in a man's head with a meat cleaver is sure to curdle a few stomachs so I warn you now to shut your eyes if you are of the squeamish type.All in all, this movie is sure to become the smash-hit of the year and might be up for an Academy Award or two!

A Masterpiece of modern cinematography,"In a nutshell, one of the best movies ever made, if not the best.Based on Alan Moore's awe-inspiring graphic novel of the same title, the movie does a wonderful job of capturing the spirit of the book, paying attention to the tiniest details and using the book as a storyboard that allows the pages to come alive on the screen and transport, for the duration of the film, to a a darker but fascinating alternate reality while looking at history that never was but, perhaps, could have been.The movie opens up with a mystery, and the tension keeps building as we meet a diverse cast of characters, enjoy spectacularly filmed, breath-taking sequences, and slowly other mysteries and unanswered questions turn the movie into a mesmerizing Chinese puzzle box in which everything, and I mean everything, can assume different shades of meaning that might at first appear isolated but really are always connected to the main themes of the movie, at times in ways we'll only recognize later on as we solve parts of the puzzle.The action sequences are fantastic, original and superbly choreographed, but often take a back seat to the depth of character development (often touching but never clichéd) and grander themes that challenge us to ponder mysteries like; time, the corruption brought on by power (who watches the watchmen?) love and the nature of life itself.A great director, a beautiful soundtrack, inspired performances by all the actors (special kudos to the man under the Rorsharch mask) and creative, stunning cinematography come together to bring to the screen one of the most intelligent, thought-provoking stories ever written.Any film lover will count it among the best movies ever made, if you haven't seen it yet, enjoy it now, movies of this caliber are few and far between.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Epic film,"I never read the comic books and I never knew the core story better than it being about superheroes. This movie surprised me. Being a huge sci-fi and action film fan this story and film fit my taste very well.The only question I have is- Why did they not make two movies instead of one? Because the movie is almost too long and it could have actually used a little bit more character development. Other than that, it's a great film. The best action flick of the year in my opinion. Good acting, good story and very well narrated. I wish this movie will get a follow up because this is the best comic book action movie I've seen.

better not to watch director's cut-too lengthy,"This was a hard attempt to replicate Sin City but performances were bleak, especially by Malin Akerman(Laurie) and Patrick Wilson(Dan).Fortunately acting by Haley(Rorschach)& Morgan(comedian) was a relief.Truly speaking Akerman looks good in romantic comedies only. I cudnt digest her playing a superhero. I haven't read the original graphic novel and I am one of those who watched the director's cut(3hrs 6 mins), so had a difficulty in grasping some parts of the movie but the scenes which had Dr. Manhattan, were really intriguing.It had a philosophical touch.Overall a good suspense has been maintained till the end.And by the time u finish it, things don't make sense at all....the story cud have been better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Great Rendition of the Novel, but lost its appeal","I read Watchmen 6 years ago, and absolutely loved it. I had heard through the websites that the movie was going to be made, but never thought that it would happen. Then I saw the preview at ""The Dark Knight"", and I knew it would be pretty close to the novel.Now I've finally seen the movie, what I can say is this: Great rendition of the novel, but the appeal that the graphic novel had is still lost on screen. Watchmen the novel took what we who read comics knew as convention and spun it on its head, while taking a piece on how superheroes would function in ""the real world"", and presented the adult themes in comics, with a lot of ""annotations"" and symbolism. Watchmen the movie pretty much took the functionality part of it, while portraying superheroes as semi-flawed (which the novel does); however, these ideas have already been made into movies (maybe not good ones, but it's been done). The result is the audiobook equivalent of the graphic novel--one person's abridged interpretation of a masterpiece. Now, to give the movie credit, the effects are beautiful, and the acting (esp. Jackie Haley as Rorsharch) is good; heck, even the climax/end is more plausible/convincing than the novel's. However, as I watch this movie, I think that if this had been made 20 years before, it would have been to movies what the graphic novel was to comics. Definitely nice watch, but not earthshattering.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A work of art.,"Alright, I went to the movies not really knowing what to expect. I understood the chance of Watchmen being a complete failure, but I also knew that it had potential to be an amazing movie. Luckily, I had a great time, and I thought the movie was a complete success. There was a tremendous amount of things that made me really enjoy this movie.Firstly, I was impressed by how consistent the movie was. Some movies are very good at the beginning and your interest slowly dies as the movie progresses, but not Watchmen. Watchmen kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Halfway during the movie, I really needed to use the restroom, but I was so completely mesmerized, I didn't want to miss a second!Secondly, I would like to compliment Zack Snyder on putting this graphic novel into a film and also respond to some rants. I truly think Zack Snyder was the best man for the job and respect him completely for staying faithful to the novel and for making this movie amazing. I've recently read some of the comments posted already about this movie and a lot of them have said ""not as good as the graphic novel"" or ""terrible compared to novel"". I myself am a huge fan of the Watchmen comics, and don't understand why all of you are so bitter. You may think the novel was better because of the way your mind perceived the novel when you first read it. Imagination has no limits when you read, so you can make something much more glorious than it truly is. But when it comes to actually putting it on the big screen, things can get extremely tedious and difficult. But personally, I think that all you big Watchmen fans should be proud that the comic book that you read and adored is on the big screen, and you should respect Zack Snyder's hard work and effort to put this into film form.Thirdly, I thought the storyline pieced together perfectly in the film. Even if you have not read the graphic novel, I think you can catch onto the story of this movie quickly and jump right in the plot. The movie does a great job of introducing the characters and also does a fantastic job on showing the era that this story took place.Finally, I am very excited that Watchmen took advantage of the ""R"" rating. It was very macabre at times, but it was great! Also, there was quite a bit of sex, and one glorified three minute sex scene! If you were planning on taking your 8 year old son to see this movie, just be ready to cover his eyes up very often.Overall, Watchmen was a fantastic visual experience that I recommend it to everyone on IMDb. If you haven't seen this movie already, go see it soon, you wont regret it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
The Watchmen was One of the Best Superhero Movies I've Ever Seen!!,"I have never been so impressed (well, maybe for the Dark Night) with a movie like The Watchmen. To know I must feel, you would have to know my background. When the movie first came out, I was going to go to it but my father said I couldn't because it was too inappropriate. By the end of that month, I had forgotten about the movie and was not even excited to go see it. My dad then let me go see the movie. It was only playing in one place in Denver at 9:40 p.m. and I knew I wouldn't get another chance to see it unless it came out on DVD. Within the first 5 minutes, I was hooked. The action was great, the storyline was great, even the opening credits were great. The characters were very well played and I don't even think the book could compare to the movie. You almost felt like you were in the time periods that they were in. The movie put you in some sort of mood that made it feel like you wanted to be there. That's not even half of what I can think of saying but all in all, the movie was phenomenal. Thank you for making it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Wow,"Snyder did a fine job with his adaptation of Watchmen. He captured the essence of the graphic novel within the restraints of a 2 hours or so movie. Watchmen was in 1985 a new take on the superhero genre which by then had really degenarated after Stan lee's successful revival of the genre in the 60s. One could argue that Spiderm,an was the first coming of age of the superhero and Watchmen the second one. Watchmen is a a brilliant take on the nature of men and on the nature of evil. We have the almost existentialist Rorschach who is so much lost in his almost absurd struggle against evil that he has lost all personality behind his mask; the completely evil Comedian who finds his place in society because it needs evil people; Dr Manhattan who becomes so detached from the human race that he views them in complete ataraxia; Night Owl and Silk Spectre who represent the Everyman who tries to find the right way and proto-fascist Ozymandias. Essentially the film revolves around his plot to save the world (set in a parallel universe in which the US won the war in Vietnam and Nixon is still President but superheros are outlawed) from nuclear war by wreaking death and destruction on New York. And here lies the moral question: if men is evil or at least incapable of living peacefully, does anyone have the right to force us into living peacefully? Does the end justify the means? The amoral dr manhattan seems to think so, uncompromising Rorschach doesn't and Silk Spectre and Might Owl are caught in the middle. Everyone is flawed excepr dr Manhattan and that's the point: he is not human anymore. All in all the story is incredibly complex but well told up to the final irony when it turns out it was all in vain and a complete moron is responsible for it. I don't know why Moore had problems with the film as Snyder did a really good job. He captured all that was essential to the story. The use of music was very good in the film and a nice substitute for Moore's quotes in the graphic novel. My only misgivings are the drawn out action sequences which at times make the film something in between and art house movie and an action film. The acting is terrific. Each actor really captures the character brilliantly and the fact that they play the characterts throughout their loives is an impressive proof of their acting abilities.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Good film, bad music","Having read the graphic novel first, I have a very short, non-spoilery review.-Loved most of the casting choices, with a possible exception of Veidt, about whom I have no serious complaint.-Overall I thought the inclusion of superfluous source material was good, but could have included more, axed some of the existing possibly. The story about Ride of the Valkyries from Hollis' autobiography excerpt would have been nice, and I especially would have liked to see the rest of the interview with Veidt.-The worst part of this film for me, and why I knocked it down to a 7 rather than an 8, is the music. One or two campy music scenes I can handle. But anytime this film can't think of a way to show characters doing something it falls on some cliché kitch music to get a slight chuckle out of the audience, see uses of All Along the Watchtower and Hallelujah for the most ridiculous.That said, good movie, wish it had taken more of it's scenes seriously.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Superb,"I wasn't expecting this to be great given the ambiguous reviews I had read but it was really good.The acting is very good with all the characters doing what is needed and delivering much better performances than you normally see in a superhero film. Haely steels the show as Rorschach whenever he is on screen although that may have more to do with the script than the acting, he does get the best lines and most brutal action scenes. Patrick Wilson and Carla Gugino supply the more human element with a believable romance and some very simple interaction. Wilson does get most of the jokes to deliver and some of them are surprisingly funny for an action film. Billy Crudup is mostly a special effect with little to do himself. Matthew Goode is fine as the villain although he is the most 2 dimensional of the characters.The special effects are good with some spectacular visuals and the action sequences are well choreographed although a few of them are over-done to the point of seeming silly and pointless.The ending is good, consistent with the tone of the film and not a simplistic happy ending.All in all a great mixture of action, intelligence and humour.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
American legends,"I have read the comic book when at school and in an enthusiastic manner shared it with a friend- which did not share my enthusiasm finding the characters and especially the Jupiter mother miserable. Reading a comic book of this character is a private and intense experience therefore I admit that when I saw the movie and realized how much it has been reviewed and analyzed, I was disappointed feeling that I had lost the pleasure of an arcane and introspective experience.Cleverly the director has an extensive introductory sequence which explains a lot of the environment and personal histories of the characters and thus partially solves the problem of presenting the information that in the comic book is offered in the form of text, such as newspaper articles or diary entries. Otherwise as far as I remember, except some cuts the graphic novel is followed closely in plot and dialogue. Some of the violent scenes have aesthetic elements closely reminding Sin City.I have to note that I found the dialogue between Mr. Manhattan and Silver Spectre 2 on Mars rather embarrassing, since I thought that those were far two weighty and perhaps pretentious stuff to share with a movie audience.Rorsarch was a character played well since he is a plausible yet twisted human being with religious yearnings- not so accurately portrayed in the movie as in the graphic novel- and a troubled childhood. He is also very strong physically but still within human conception, unlike the Olympian Ozymandias or the impossible Dr. Manhattan.This movie has brought forward early memories in me and I am trying to remember out of memory the parts of the graphic novel left out from he filmic production.Still I believe that the most impressive sequence is the introductory one which is I think mainly the creation of the director.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Snyder did the unthinkable and actually succeeded in it.,"A movie that was too grim for 2009 and maybe even a little for 2020 (surprising, innit?).Watchmen tackled the problem of the moral dilemma of superhero existence. Like the tag line: ""If the watchmen watch us? Who watches the watchmen?""Back in 2009 superhero genre was just getting started, MCU released its first smash hit while WB were riding the wave of The Dark Knight so it might come as a shock that they decided to green light such a film. Superhero fatigue didn't exist then.But a decade later, it does. And moral questions like this does deserve to be examined. And Watchmen does exactly that.Based on the smash hit Alan Moore graphic novel of the same, Watchmen is about a group of retired superheroes who hold the future of humankind in their own hands. It takes place in a dark dystopian future-past where Nixon won a third term and US won the Vietnam war.Taking scenes right out of the panel (Literally) Snyder creates a moral reflection of sorts on humans and how twisted they can be. Even larger-than-human being have sins like humans all the same. We expect superheroes to be of higher virtue and to lead humankind but what about their human side?Needless to say, Snyder does an amazing job to put these huge material to screen while keeping its heart in place. It does not lose all the edginess and style of the novel while improving the motion picture.Must watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Not bad...as long as you haven't read the novel.,"""The Watchmen"" is a movie adaptation of what many consider to be the best graphic novel of all time. The differences in mediums immediately makes this process extremely difficult, but also makes the comparisons become somewhat less important. A movie must not be compared with a book even if they share so much in common and as such it must be said that ""The Watchmen"", while a failed adaptation, is an above average movie that presents the story in a comprehensible and maybe even in an enjoyable way.Unfortunately, this reviewer has read the novel. This reviewer also noticed from the very beginning that the director wanted to be faithful to the book. Scene after scene we are shown animated copies of the book, dialog included. Impressive from a technical point of view that they are able to reproduce all that wonderful and rich imagery. The problems however became apparent soon after. Even if most of the scenes follow the book, that becomes irrelevant since so much of what adds the book its value is missing from the movie. Furthermore, the movie's visuals, even if impressive, didn't require any creative input from the crew since they are copies. All the creativity of value is mostly technical. Worse, the few creative changes that are seen in the movie are all in the purpose of showing more violence or sex or whatever commonplace sentimentality feelings they want the characters to express.In the end, ""The Watchmen"" is a good movie, but mostly because it doesn't stray from the novel much and has some of it's value. If you want the full vision and experience, then you're going to have to read the novel.Snyder may have pulled ""300"" off, but ""The Watchmen"" required a more thoughtful approach on adaptation; decisions and choices would have to be made so that, instead of keeping the visuals, the movie could have kept the ideas and feelings of the novel.7/10. Good movie. Terrible adaptation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A Pleasant Surprise,"I have known about Watchmen since last year, and (ever since i saw the previews) I have been eagerly awaiting its premiere. To get ready for the film, I went out and bought a copy of the graphic novel on which it is based to get ready for when the movie came out. I absolutely fell in love with the book, but I came to another realization: the story is practically unfilmable. Watchmen, the book, is extremely complex, full of sub-plots and flashbacks and newspaper clippings and book excerpts. I just couldn't imagine how they'd pull it off, even with a two and a half hour running time. Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised.Watchmen, the movie, is still quite complex for your typical Hollywood blockbuster, but not so complex that it becomes unwatchable for the average film-goer. This is quite a feat, considering the story revolves around various characters in various different time periods. In my opinion, it'd be very difficult to make a better adaptation than the one Snyder has done. But, having said that, I do have one major complaint. Most of the film is done in the style of films such as 300 or The Spirit, with the slowed-down action sequences. Personally, I don't think this really worked for the film. I would much prefer it to have been done in a gritty, realistic style. This makes some of the action sequences a bit laughable, in parts.Aside from that, the film still makes the characters hard to love, but even harder to hate. Watchmen follows The Dark Knight in blurring the line between hero and villain. Hopefully more studios will follow these two film's examples and continue to make more thought-provoking, serious superhero movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
It could have been better if Snyder hadn't ruined it,"I know a lot of people like this movie, but for me it's just good, even though I really should like it a lot. There are a lot of great things, but there are also flaws that bother me. He would say director Snyder is the biggest problem. His style and signature, which he has in all his films, is visible here. It insists too much on the visuals, and it doesn't turn out well in the end. Slow motion in too many scenes, repetitive motifs, excessive use of force and violence. That is much more important to him than the characters and the story, and it shows. It is clear to me that he had a difficult job here, but I think that he did not succeed in it completely. Too long a movie, several different versions, it all smells bad to me. It's a shame that the end product isn't better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Good-looking but disappoints in comparison with graphic novel.,"In short: Do NOT, repeat, NOT, see the movie until you've read the graphic novel. It offers nothing that the graphic novel doesn't do better.If you're not normally into comics, you may consider that this one was elected in TIME MAGAZINE as one of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to the present. Yes, novel. The graphic novel ""Watchmen"" really sticks out as full-fledged (and extremely original) literature.Elaborating: Whenever a movie is made from a story already told in another medium, someone will complain that this or that was omitted. They (okay, now 'we') are always right of course, but other people tend not to care, accepting that the movie 'cannot have it all'.But then why make it? This question is extra relevant in this case, where the original story was already in a visual medium.Furthermore, the 'you cannot put it all in a movie' argument is wrong. The 'Watchmen' movie actually demonstrates that a completely loyal adaption would have been possible. It would have been longer, but it would also have been incredibly much better if there had to be a movie version.Watchmen the movie IS impressive, and until a point extremely loyal to the graphic novel.The problem is, ALL good things in the movie result from sticking EXACTLY to scenes from the graphic novel. But about one and a half hours into it, it will be clear that you can stop drooling in anticipation of the movie version of the correct ending from the real story. And also that the lack of a lot of background from the graphic novel is rapidly beginning to hollow out the the movie adaption.So, after an impressively loyal start the movie ultimately fails by deviating from the heavily superior graphic novel.Without giving too much away (trying to avoid spoilers by only hinting at how differences from the graphic novel discredit the movie):1) In the novel, Rorschach follows a series of leads concerning missing persons in a storyline that builds up to the climax. The climax of the original graphic novel is radically different from the movie, and the build-up storyline is part of why it's actually devastating. The movie is weakened by omitting this side story..2) A lot of 'man on the street' sequences from the graphic novel are omitted. These scenes revolve around a street newsstand and its occasional as well as frequent customers. Without these scenes, the movie lacks the 'consequenses for man on the street' interest of the graphic novel, and also removes a lot of human interest from the Rorschach character. Also, the 'pirate cartoon' (which refers to a comic-within-the-comic from the graphic novel, and which has been adapted separately) cannot be inserted in a way that will make sense in an 'ultimate' Watchmen movie cut as planned. (It is a comic book story read by a young man who frequents the street newsstand. Without the newsstand scenes there will be no context for the pirate story).3) The movie follows Rorschach, Night owl and Silk Spectre. A lot of background about another super hero, Ozymandias, is left out. The background given in the graphic novel serves to make some important points for understanding the entire story, and the movie is weakened by the omissions.4) As already mentioned, the climax differs from the novel. While good enough seen autonomously, it pales in comparison to the correct ending. And it does smell of ""The Dark Knight"" - so much that I think it's a pure and unoriginal ripoff, and that at the cost of the real storys uncompromising originality.The movie is still highly impressive 'in it's own right', but it IS redundant where it's loyal to the graphic novel, and finally inferior for not sticking completely to being loyal.A perfect movie version would have been approximately four hours long (four and a half if counting the pirate story in). The movie clearly proves that a loyal transfer of the graphic novel to cinema was possible. But it fails to be it.Without putting down it's stunning visuals and it's dark and brooding intelligence, this is NOT an 'ingenious', or 'brilliant' movie. This is just another relatively okay (and certainly well-produced) movie adaption of a novel from which the true brilliance and genius was borrowed, and which you really ought to read instead.By the way: Why the BLEEP isn't Mozarts Requiem credited in the music list, along with information of conductor, orchestra and record label?Post edit: Much much later I am finally changing what I almost immediately regretted, namely giving this movie 6 stars. My reason for that was it does entertain to a point (about halfway, where is turn to pure boredom and disgust if you know and like the novel), and it is visually good looking, but so are lots of other movies that differ from this in being worth one's time. Since it completely fails in keeping the stuff that makes the graphic novel great, I don not feel it deserves attention at all, and therefore I have changed to 1 star. This movie simply should not have been made. I never felt an urge to see the movie again, I do regret having ever wasted time with it. Knowing the novel it merely annoys and bores me, and I don't like it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

At the same time one of the best and one of the most boring DC movies,"The film begins with confusing scenes that make no sense without a context, so I had the impression that I did not start watching the movie, but that I fell in the middle of the second season of some series. It is too prolix and discursive, without any focus on anything. Many things happen, but it does not make much sense and it looks like it does not lead anywhere. There are movies that start slow and even boring, but later everything starts to make sense, but here, even after more than two hours, there's no real plot to hold your attention. Okay, the movie lasts for three and a half hours, so at that moment there's still the duration of the entire average movie left, but two hours of introduction is really too much. After more than two hours story begins to get meaning and movie brings some really impressive scenes. Sex in the aircraft was first thing to wake me up a little and then follow the action scenes in prison and scenes on Mars. If the whole movie was like that half an hour or so, I would probably be thrilled, but two hours of boring introduction to the story at the pace of tectonic movements and over the top ending, with totally redundant pathetic elements, prevailed in the formation of the overall impression. Less than hour of excellent material with everything before it being boring and everything after it being stale. The best thing about this movie is great music (Nat King Cole, Bob Dylan, Simon & Garfunkel, Janis Joplin, Billie Holiday, Leonard Cohen, Jimi Hendrix), and Carla Gugino, who, even in a supporting role, always improves the overall impression and makes me rate a movie at least half a star higher.

The characters are true to themselves and to the script, they have dark sides and the world is not black and white like in every other superhero movie. The movie shows us the glimpses of the past and how it is affecting the present behavior of the characters. Dr. Manhattan is slowly loosing its humanity and has no interest in humankind. Ozymandias end up saving the human race from itself but. Rorschach unbending princeliness shows us what it means to be a true superhero.

The so called superheroes have really no superpower except the blue dude.. the only thing that makes the film worth watching is the special effects which really rock. The movie tends to be boring sometimes with dull dialogs like the one silk specter has with Dr Manhattan on mars trying to convince him to save the planet.The movie has the same idea as "" The day the earth stood still"" and at some point you just wish for the movie to end, the duration is way too long. The lines are quite hilarious sometimes and the action is kind of childish. Silk spectre and Nite Owl look like batman and robin clones, they ride a silly ship that looks like a giant jellyfish.. And in the end Dr Manhattan sacrifices his honor and one of his friends for world peace.. World Peace..sounds like miss congeniality..

Underrated,"In my country this movie didn't last long in the cinemas, so the first time I saw this movie it was on DVD. I had been attracted to the story and after a first viewing I was blown away by the CGI, acting performances and the story.Personally I still believe that this movie remains underrated (even after five years there are only two graphic novel/comic book adaptations that are superior to this movie and these are sin city and the dark knight). Watchmen gives a raw perspective on the lives of different vigilantes. The mixture between the rather unknown actors (and not blockbuster actors) and the perfect CGI makes this movie so great. Add an incredible soundtrack to this mixture and you're in for one hell of a ride.Personally I have seen both the theatrical version as the director's cut and I have tried to watch the ultimate cut. It must be said that the first two versions are very good to near perfect (especially the director's cut adds some very beautiful scenes to the movie). If you're watching this movie for the first time though it might be better to watch the theatrical cut because most people don't like three hour movies. Personally I prefer the director's cut, but that's only because I'm a huge fan of the movie and prefer a longer version of the story. The ultimate cut though is not for everyone, I have tried to watch this version but had to stop. This version adds the story 'Tales of the Black Freightner' and because this story is an animation 'movie' every scene that is added from this picture forms a kind of a fracture with the main (watchmen) storyline. I think that the ultimate cut is only for the real die hard fans of watchmen (and especially of the graphic novel).Overall I think that Watchmen should be seen by everyone because it's one of the few successful hero-stories that doesn't show a hope-giving picture of these men and women but that tells a real dramatical series of events.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A visual masterpiece,"Every one in Hollywood considered the graphic novel Watchmen unfilmable. Zach Snyder who is well known for his visually impressive film 300 too the novel and made an impressive adaptation that far exceeded my expectations. Before seeing this movie, I had not read the graphic novel. After viewing, I bought it and compared. I was surprised at how thorough he had been. Watchmen is visually immersive, story and character driven with an amazing amount of SFX and VFX. The cast all around is fantabulous and no one does poorly. This movie also got the careers of a few actors going which doesn't surprise me. For anyone who is hesitant at watching this epic movie, just go in for Rorschach because man oh man is Jackie Earl Haley a great actor. He was my favorite character and I loved the way he moved and talked. The movie is set in an alternate world where certain things differ from ours and the city looks very dark and gritty. This is a very long film, however, it is required in order to do justice to the lengthy novel and all the characters inhabiting this world. The story is complex to the extent that you'll need to watch it a few times but that isn't a bad thing because it is a fun movie to watch in general.Snyder also uses plenty of slow motion in order to enhance the breath taking action and fighting scenes which are choreographed brilliantly. I really have no negatives for this movie because every time I watch it I get sucked into this fictionalized world and really invest in these very flawed but awesome characters.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Who watches the Watchmen? I DO!,"Watchmen is one of those films where you need to find a day where you have NOTHING planned, and then sit down and watch it. This film requires a heck of a lot of concentration. Being 2 hours and 40 minutes long means it isn't the longest film out there by any standards, but the pacing is a tad slow for most people (including myself) and so getting through it may be a bit of a pain unless you have nothing else to do.I shall start with what I always start with; Director and actors. The actors in this film are, of course, top notch. Jackie Earle Haley as 'Rauschach' worked beautifully. His dark and mysterious tone suits the character perfectly. Dr. Manhattan was also brilliantly played by Billy Crudup as a very cold and unmovable genius was superb. The ensemble is good all round. The best part of the ensemble is, of course, Zack Snyder. Having loved the beautiful cinematography, well-paced and gripping story of '300', I expected great things from this film, and he delivered in most circumstances.The cinematography in this film is exceptional. The intro is stunning, and merits as possibly on of the best of all time, and the general atmosphere of cold-war America, tainted by violence and the fear of nuclear war, feels eerily possible. Just brilliant. Every blaze of yellow looks great, every shining blue person is a great addition to the overall feel of the film.The plot is great, apart from one small thing; the pace. It just seems that the action culminates far too late, which makes the ending a bit iffy. Yes, it works and looks great, but the execution just leaves you thinking ""WAAAAAAAA... oh, that it?"". Not very good considering the outstanding nature of 300.Therefore, I cannot put this film up there with my favourites. It looks superb, and has some brilliant acting not to mention the label of a brilliant director on it. It is all brought down a bit though by the poor pacing. I simply could not watch this film twice, in a year even. 8.3/10, a noble effort at such a grand concept.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Probably more enjoyable on DVD...,"The entire ""Watchmen"" thing was completely unknown to me, except for a panel gag cartoon featuring Rorschach browsing a porn mag: ""Inkblots, nothing but inkblots!""So my perception towards this cinematic rumpus was unbiased. And i must admit that i enjoyed (and cherish) this optical ghost-train-roller-coaster jumble for it's unique and plain weirdness, some really cool one-liners and the extensive care for the finest detail.But even the ""subtle"" phases of the movie were either entirely spaced-out, or soaked with sorrow and foreshadowing, leaving the viewer with just another heavy impression or hunch. So, the whole spectacle became more or less lackluster over time.You can put a comic-book aside, if there's something you must digest, but ""Watchmen"" just keeps on punching the uncovered parts. Maybe that's why a friend told me that this movie made him sleep. Overload.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
The most important Series I've ever seen.,"The writing is incredible, the acting sublime and the cinematography otherworldly. Trust Damon Lindelof to use a comic book premise to tackle the most important challenges facing American society today.

The only downside is that some people will assume it is all fiction just because it uses Comic book characters and story.

"After a second view, it just grows on you","Watchmen has some fresh material that no comic book adaptation dared, so a kind of revolution, but there are some problems in it that make the movie a hard and less entertaining experience. In other words, it is related to you. It is like if your viewpoint about cinema, comic books or super heroes is the same with Alan Moore, Watchmen will be your movie, but if you are interested in rather cinema, entertainment, then it will turn into a hard experience. Mostly, the development of the events makes the movie less engaging, gripping and less entertaining. Visually, Watchmen is very well, dark, but at the same time colorful, some images are dazzling, the plot is astonishing, because inventive and smart, but somehow, there is lack of impressive material (except for Rorschach?) I don't know why, but Watchmen recalls me Sin City, another revolution in cinema. I have not read the comic book of Watchmen yet, but as the people said, the movie is very loyal to the comic book, even some of them say the most loyal adaptation so far. As for the innovations, in Watchmen, super heroes are not as pure as snow, especially The Comedian and Dr. Manhattan. One kills or hurts innocent people and enjoy doing that, the other does not care about humanity and he kills innocent people either. This is also the first movie which we see toys of some super heroes which is good. The movie has some social and political subtexts, it has some great one- liners... A corrupt and decayed world, life and death, a little philosophy, Watchmen has all those and more, but somehow it leaves a ""funny"" taste in your mouth. It seems that some critics and the people who are like Alan Moore don't complain about lack of action or lack of tension or slight entertainment etc. but the poster, the characters, the story prepare you for action and excitement, but the comic book is not about that, so by the loyalty of Snyder, we see a different movie than we had expected. By the way, the movie has some action, don't get me wrong. However, also there are some bizarre and raw violent scenes which I have no idea about. Good news for the people who like such kind of stuff, but that scene which they fight a group of gang was too much! Very luckily, there are not many slow motion shots in Watchmen in comparison with 300, Snyder uses the camera greatly here. By the way, I did not complain about the sex scene at all, unbelievably, many people talk about this and say it was awful, bizarre. It was just a scene, not good, not bad, if you ask me. Yes, as some people think too, the character who 'shoulders' the movie was Rorschach, he has become my favorite character from the movie. A sort of, he recalls Sin City's Marv also. His adventures, his ""face"", a very interesting character from the world of Watchmen. The other characters, especially Dr. Manhattan are interesting too, but Rorschsach was like the only character gets the movie move. However, these are not the things that the fans of the comic book want to discuss (remember, it changes according to what you are interested in) The parts he appears are the most appealing parts of the movie. There are some further problems either. Patrick Wilson is one of the most weird choices for that character or why they used plastic make up for Nixon? I haven't seen, but Frank Langella would be very good. The parts that take place in the huge station/base were uninspiring and a bit cliché and also recently we saw a similar one in Hellboy II. Despite all these things, I appreciate Snyder, because he is an auteur, he has his own style, he is not one of those ""incumbent directors"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A little tiresome but well adapted,"This is certainly a worthy adaptation to the big screen. I don't know the novel religiously, but I know it somewhat well, and it seems sure enough that this film carries through the themes, events and at times even words.What must be applauded is that it dares take itself seriously - it's violent, dramatic, even a bit disconcerting. Not all heroes save the day, that's really the point of the entire novel and film. You can only harp on the heart-strings so many times (even Spider-Man is getting a bit tiresome), but when a movie punches you in the face, you have a reason to be dizzy.There are weak points to it though. I think the theatrical cut could've possibly been even shorter (~2h15m? come on, think about it), with some sort of absurdly extensive ultimate end-to-end-all 5-disc DVD/Blu-Ray edition further down the line.Jackie Earle Hayley gives a spectacular Rorschach, even his ""gravelly"" voice (really described as being more monotone) and unrelenting quest for punishing criminality. It was too bad that the psychologist scenes were a little different (maybe we'll at least get the entire closing ""monologue"" somewhere down the line, but I guess you can't have it all).Some say there's ""no trick"" to Billy Crudup, but that's the trick in and of itself - to make a character seemingly indifferent feel human, earnest and interesting. He doesn't simply drone on, he's actually acting with every line and twitch.The adaptation works to the point where it's like reading - it couldn't hold my interest burning passionately the entire way through, but where it does work, it really works (the opening credits and Dr. Manhattan's origin comes to mind). The fact that it does work the entire way through is a testament to the original book, that there are themes resonating beyond just the characters themselves.At this point I have no rush to see Watchmen again. Whenever there's word of some sort of ultimate package, maybe I'll check it out, but there's a lot to take in, and it's mostly through the dialoge and characters. Hardly your typical action or thriller flick, but one to be savored on occasion, like (pardon the metaphor) a fine wine with enough years to it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Great film, but only for certain people....","This movie is sure to become a cult classic someday. It's just one of those movies that people either love or hate. I think the length of the film is that gets most people, but I was entertained the whole time.The way this movie looks, first off, is great. Most of it is very dark and stormy, and really sets a great mood. The story is also very well told. It is more of a character study than anything else, and does a great job of making you understand the characters.I think a lot of the negative reviews were based off the violence in the film. It is not your average happy, jolly, superman film. But I think it works good in the movie. It is something different.

I love it!,"I watched the Ultimate Cut, and it was absolutely amazing. I had always thought that the additional footage wouldn't be enough to fix the issues with Zach Snyder's adaptation, especially after seeing the Theatrical Cut. However, I was completely wrong. The Ultimate Cut truly deserves its title, as it provides three-and-a-half hours of cinematic darkness that seeps into your bones. Every aspect of the story is explored in depth, and the characters are fully fleshed out. The movie features many unforgettable scenes that are sure to delight any Watchmen fan. The reason why I enjoyed it so much is that the Theatrical Cut lacked any real depth, so the scenes didn't have the same impact. With all the added context and layers, the Ultimate Cut finally makes Watchmen feel complete.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
What have they done?,"It is the 1980s, but in an alternative reality with 2 major differences, one masked heros (not super heros exist) and one god like super hero does exist (Dr Manhattan).It is the 1980s, the doomsday clock is moving closer and closer to midnight, nuclear destruction is close.It is hard to review this movie. On one hand it is a literary master piece. The comic book (I won't use graphic novel, because while it is one of the first graphic novels, it wasn't published that way) is visually boring but tells the story in a multilayered manner.Transitioning to a movie the layers are gone, but in a masterful way which suits the movie medium.Unfotunately made today it is a period piece, and not enough has been done to remake the movie as a period piece.The visual style is up-to-date not part of the 1980s, the action scenes which involved ordinary people seem more like the over the top kungfu or super hero pieces. There is no colour or lighting styles from the 80s. The clothes chosen are timeless. Younger viewers might get confused by the alternative time line, not really being able to fit things together as not enough back story is included.In addition the comic book's original visual style doesn't stand up against modern comic books and graphic novels and provides no visual inspiration for the movie.Story wise, it is still up there. It is hard to really say, because I found I was filling in untold pieces from the comic book, rather than them being retold to me.In addition many elements are only really understood by children of the 70s and 80s. In the 70s the caped hero become an icon (Elvis wore a cape on stage). In the 80s these heros were not so popular and the events in the alternative time reflect this.In addition, only those who grew up in the 1980s, where we would often have serious conversations about surving nuclear holocaust, can really get the core of the story. This is something that was not fleshed out in the movie version.But then maybe audiences are smart enough not to spoon fed every part of a story (unlike modern movies).In the end the positives out weigh the negatives.Something, different, post modern, interesting. I suspect it may become a cult classic as viewers return to the original comics, or review and find the layers inside the story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Excellent Adaption,"If you're a fan of the graphic novel, there's a good chance you'll like this movie a lot. Despite a few changes it's a pretty faithful adaption.WHY IT RECEIVED CRITICISM
This movie fell flat with audiences because it's incredibly dark, even for a super hero movie. The characters aren't likable in your typical sense. Heroes like Rorschach and Dr. Manhattan are heavily loved by fans but neither of them make the story any less bleak. Also no one is necessarily heroic which makes it hard to root for anyone. In a sense this is what makes Watchmen so thought provoking and unique. It makes you question what was morally correct and who was the real hero in the end. To many, this kind of content will come off as depressing or disturbing. I wouldn't recommend it to viewers who are expecting an MCU type film. If you are a fan of darker comics like what DC is famous for, then this is probably the type of story for you.One other critique I have is that some of the dialogue doesn't translate well from book to screen. Snyder added his own iconic dialogue that resonated very nicely with audiences but other parts of the script come off as a bit corny. While I appreciate the film staying faithful to the writing, I think it limits the ability of character development when you can only work with one storyline.Personally I love this movie. I'm a huge fan of both DC and Marvel so I don't think all marvel fans will dislike this movie. It's just extremely different. Overall I'd say its ability to create a realistic superhero scenario is something that should be praised.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Not bad, but not great.","I don't want to go on and on about this movie. The fact is that it began, following the book perfectly until about the one-hour point, and then it went on its own way. I have read the book, and the book is great, and the movie started to be as good as the book, but unfortunately, the movie would have had to be about five hours long to truly captivate its written counterpart. With that being said, I can only say this: if you have read the book, you will be disappointed. If you haven't, you may very likely truly enjoy the uniqueness of the movie. I really only have two complaints about the movie. One, I didn't need to see Dr. Manhattan's penis every five seconds. Two, the ending is different from the book, and with that, I was disappointed because Dr. Manhattan is made to be the villain, when in the book he is not. So, if you are expecting something truly different and unique, go see it. If you are expecting Spider Man or Superman, stay home and order pizza. And finally, if you are a parent with young children, and you take them to see this movie, you should be ashamed of yourself and your kids should be taken from you.

Well...One thing on my mind.,"So yeah I watched Watchmen the other night. Actually it's so damn lone that I watched it in two nights. Zack. I guess he is my second favorite director(not screenwriter). He knows how to do a badass movie I'll give him credit for that. But it's not always enough. Sure it was enough with 300 but this time around it's different. The plot is. jy? you know what it's so boring that I won't even review it. I didn't like all characters except for one. Seriously I don't remember a single name.The one character I did like is a dude with a sock on his head. He's badass. So I guess it's all bad. Oh yeah and the fact that it's unesessery long. I'd like it more if it was shorter. The good things. Well actually there's only two good thing. The sound and music and the fact that this movie is truly badass(not as much as 300 but anyway). The action scenes are so cool. They just incredible. The style of the movie is awesome(wow I guess it's three) I admit that. So overall a boring plot, uninteresting characters and cool badassness. Seriously compared with the Dark Knight or even Batman Begins it's just crap. The dark knight had badassness as well as script, characters and acting. Oh yeah the acting here is decent I guess - nothing incredible that would erase the flaws. So 6.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Worst movie I've seen in the last 5 years,"I'll start off by saying I've never read the Watchmen comic.This movie might have been a little more bearable with about an hour chopped off of it. There are many scenes that drag along presumably for 'dramatic effect'. If anyone is old enough to remember having to sit through the scene in the first star trek movie where the enterprise is unveiled you know what I mean.It seemed like there were several scenes where the music was really out of place, and poorly selected or mixed. I mean, it takes place in the 70's, all the music is from the 70's, and then they start playing '99 luftballoons' ? I found the scenes with the Kennedy assassination and Kent State massacre in poor taste but probably younger viewers won't mind.I get that it's a dark movie and a dark comic but the way the story is told you really have little empathy for anyone in the movie. All through the movie you don't really care who lives and who dies. There is no sense of pacing in the movie, it just seems to random speed up and slow down. It's one of those rare movies that has you tapping your foot impatiently waiting for it to end. The most positive comment I heard coming out of the theatre was a guy telling his date ""It wasn't THAT bad"".YES IT WAS.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Yes, They Are The Good Guys.","Watchmen is big. Really big. From the time –span the story follows, to the issues it deals with, the amount of characters and the sheer scope of the whole thing. It's just massive, (note that this is a review of the Director's Cut. The Theatrical Cut is a 9/10). But that's only to be expected, considering it's an adaptation of one the biggest, and one of the most critically acclaimed comic books of all time- which was one of the first to define the graphic novel genre and remains one of its great masterpieces-, so being stingy with its scale and the care taken to craft the film adaptation was never an option. Now, people will look down on me for saying this, and truth be told I do feel a twinge of guilt saying this, but I really do feel that the film lives up to it's source work, and personally, I think it surpasses it. I'm sure that's something that no fan of the graphic novel will want to hear, but I truly believe that the film takes all of its best elements and adds its own great touches, and manages to create an incredibly sharp and hugely intelligent experience.This is easier said than done, which is evident from the amount of time the project spent in development Hell, waiting for someone crazy enough to make it, attracting names like Tim Burton and Terry Gilliam and others, before finally landing into the brave and talented hands of Zack Snyder, an already established pleaser of fan-boys and non-comic fans alike, with hits like 300 and Dawn of the Dead. But with Watchmen, Snyder cements himself as not only being capable of crafting a hugely faithful and worthy adaptation of an acclaimed work, but an incredibly talented and tactful director who isn't afraid to do his own thing. Big as the film is, there's not doubt its everything Hollywood hates, with a running time of over 3 hours, a slow-moving and complex plot, razor sharp satirical undertones and some extremely graphic scenes, it's frankly a miracle it was ever allowed to be made. But Snyder and his creative team, with writers David Hayter and Alex Tse and a team of producers, stuck by their guns, and have crafted a film that even Alan Moore, a notoriously harsh critic of adaptations of his work, would have to admit is pretty good.The story is gigantic and spans over 40 years of history, and reaches far off to the red planet Mars, dealing with any topic, be they political, social or personal, in between. It takes place in an alternate 1985, where the world teeters on the brink of nuclear war, and where superheroes have been outlawed. When one of them is killed, Rorschach, the last hero still in operation, unknowingly stumbles on a plot that will change the entire world, leading to the re-emergence of other heroes that had previously retired, including Nite Owl, Silk Spectre and others, who must do what they can to prevent a global catastrophe in a world quickly falling apart.Handling the material with great enthusiasm, and showing huge skill with the slow-moving story and character/theme driven plot, Snyder uses the aspects the graphic novel couldn't to great effect, with striking visuals and incredible colour use, breathtaking cinematography from Larry Fong and a fantastic soundtrack, (opening with one of the best montages ever made), and boasts some incredibly well-made scenes that leads to amazing story development, with not a dull moment in sight, despite an epic and sprawling plot that deals with themes like political totalitarianism, society, humanity, morality and the relevance of existence and life itself. But, believe it or not, at its heart, Watchmen is extremely satirical. True, it's a bleak, razor sharp satire, and its uncomfortable humour is mostly earned through shock value rather than broad comedy. But underneath all the heavy themes and some truly disturbing sequences, Watchmen is a sharply-observed and pitch-black comic satire that delights in deconstructing the entire superhero genre, and cast a glaring eye at what it would be like to actually be a costumed hero, asking questions like what would make real people actually become heroes, how the world would react to them, the impact they would have on society and the impact a real superhero with god-like powers would have on the world if they existed.But one of the greatest strengths of Watchmen is its 3-dimensional and multi-layered characters that are thought-provoking and keenly satirical of other superhero characters, brought to life by a great cast that all really seem to understand their characters, and who succeed in nailing their performances of them to the wall. Jackie Earle Haley gives a fantastic performance as Rorschach, and depicts his unflinching brutality and expert superhero skills with his paranoid naivety brilliantly. Patrick Wilson is perfect as Dan Dreiberg, and gives a down-to-earth portrayal of a man lost in the mediocrity of normality, and together with Malin Akerman as Laurie Jupiter, who's Silk Spectre is spot-on and powerful, the two convey perfectly the vital theme of people who once lived lifestyles of excitement and thrills, but are now hollow shells of their former selves, desperate and driven by their need to don their costumes once again. Billy Crudup gives a perfect performance as Doctor Manhattan with his cold, calculating personality and his emotionless mind, and Matthew Goode is spot-on as the dignified yet seedy Ozymandias, but the stand-out performance for me, perhaps just for the sheer strength of his character alone, is Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the Comedian, who is so gloriously twisted and sadistic you may cringe every time he comes on-screen.Watchmen is definitely not for everyone. Its 3-hour length, unusual story/themes and moments of extreme nastiness, probably means that most people won't care for it. But if you want to see a film that really puts a twist on superhero movies, then this is a film you should definitely experience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Great adaptation of Alan Moore's magnum opus,"3 hours and 30 minutes of pure Zack Snyder at his best is the best definition of the Ultimate Cut. I've watch the theatrical cut as well, both have its qualities, but the Ultimate Cut is really something. I've paused sometimes to check the graphic novel and Snyder really captures the tone, the world, the aspect and the messages of the original work. I liked the inclusion of the Tales of the Black Freighter, back on the movie I was thinking about the pacing, not liking it, but after seeing all the movie, the pacing here is good as well. slow-burning, almost hypnotic, I paused sometimes, wish I didn't, seeing this continuously is a experience. Here you can expect fidelity, it looks, walks and talk like the graphic novel, some changes, but I understand why they changed. Expect a great cinematography as well, the gray look of the film fits the narrative, help to create the admosphere of a world without hope, filthy and about to go to war, Zack Snyde directering is great here, he understands the visual medium, he have his own style, unique and kind of megalomaniac. The soundtrack, the edgy gore violence, distinctive action sequences, you know it's a Zack Snyder film. There's so much great things here, a few I didn't like, more subjective things than objective ones. And this film should be released later. After decades of superhero comic books, Alan Moore created THE anti-superhero comic book, which ironically is praised as the best superhero comic book ever made. If this film released with a established MCU, like in 2015 or even now, the impact of this film would be stronger, since it's a very unique comic book movie and different of all films of its kind, even with Logan and Joker out there, but you can use the argument that this film is ahead of its time, because it is.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Do not judge a book by its cover,"After having seen this movie, I am left puzzled, speechless, lost in thoughts, left with many questions about the characters.I have not read the comic series; in fact I was not even aware that this movie was derived from a comic series, and due to the somewhat ""strange"" movie poster, I prepared myself to watch another Hollywood flick about heroes, with cheesy lines, half-hearted acting, horrible storyline, men with a fetish for costumes and pseudo-identities, etc.I was surprised in many ways. 1st, that Hollywood was actually capable of delivering something so thought provoking, so deep as I could have only expected it from books. I personally have only read very few books in my life, as I do not have the patience, loose concentration and interest very fast. Hence, as I am sure my previous comment labels me for my generation, I consider movies my ""book collection.""Having read several reviews of this movie now, it is hard for me to establish credit either to the comic series write Andy Moor or the director of the movie Zack Snyder. In my opinion Andy Moor deserves great respect for packaging a bizarre presentation of reality, in the form of men in costumes, labeled as heroes, in order to deliver a message, making it more appealing for the masses. On the other hand, I am very happy that there are directors out there with such a keen eye for detail, understand the message, transforming it in another form.

No one hinted at the fact that Veidt's attempted assassination might have something to do with superhero murders. It didn't really feel like there was a mask killer.

The adage is true,"There is an adage that has become popular over the past decade.

The first time I saw CONTACT, the night I saw DOGVILLE, and AI, the night I was at the London celebrity premiere of THE ABYSS, and when we watched .REC one dark night. There's plenty more, but nowhere near enough. My perfect movie drug is a hard fix to find. When it happens, I'm happy for days afterwards.Last night, I saw Zack Snyder's WATCHMEN, and it's going to be a happy weekend. Last weekend I finished the WATCHMEN graphic novel for the second time (1st was 10 years ago), and loved it again. NB: I am not generally a fan of comic books, or superhero movies. I thought BATMAN BEGINS was way, way, way better than the hugely over-rated DARK KNIGHT. The only other comic book series I have ever read was SPAWN, fifteen years ago, when I was in the toy business and we were working on the action figures... (still got some in mint cond, and a pair of SPAWN tracky bottoms which I've always been too embarrassed to wear...). But I had a feeling, going in to the movie, and having read plenty of reviews, that once again this was going to be one where I bucked the critical trend ... I approached it ready to experience an uncritical, complete pleasure.WATCHMEN delivered it all. For me, Snyder is three-for-oh ... DAWN OF THE DEAD and 300 were superb, but WATCHMEN is a step up. I loved every second, but here's the catch: it's because I had just read the graphic novel. IMHO, watching WATCHMEN without reading the original first, you're more likely to hate it. The film is so full of flavour if you've read the book, in almost every scene a character mutters something, or there's a scenery detail, which gives a spark of pleasure to the book's fans...but which would be lost on the unprepared. Me, I was enthralled as, time after time, the movie brought so many key scenes - and tiny grace notes - to life from the graphic novel. Faithful to the source? Hell yes, and brilliantly too.Let's list the key criticisms which others on IMDb have aimed at WATCHMEN:Boring - I was wide awake and engaged throughout. Inappropriate music - the music rocks, the only bum note is Leonard Cohen (come on, he's rubbish). The sex scene - trashed as being cheesy and corny...I disagree, you need it, at that point in time, as much as they do...and it ends on a killer, laugh out loud flamethrower joke. Slow motion action - again, why people have trashed this is beyond me, it's part of the film's core visual style, you go with it, it's spectacular. Hard to follow - if you've read the book, it's a piece of cake. Different ending - Snyder's big ending is better than the book's, sorry Alan. Manhattan's willy - I mean really, it's there on screen, what, ten times? And not for long... A few sniggers in the cinema, but the good doctor's willy isn't THAT in your face. Dodgy CGI - Again, for me, part of the film's style, there's some photo-real stuff and some stylised CGI which is clearly part of the cartoon look.And the actors. Look, I already told you, when I love something I love everything. Kudos to every single one - and special mention for Jackie Earl Haley and Patrick Wilson. And Malin Akerman, as they say in Barnsley, you'll do fo me lass.I'll stop now, I loved it, WATCHMEN was staggeringly good, the special edition DVD just has to be a classic (come on guys, get it right). I wouldn't change a second of this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"A great fan tribute, a few small upsets","I'll say up front - since it will naturally affect my review - that I'm a huge fan of the graphic novel, and had been eagerly awaiting the movie interpretation for some time.Oh, and likely some spoilers, minor or otherwise, throughout.My initial reaction was that it was a wonderful interpretation of a groundbreaking work, made by people who obviously cared very much about the source material, but that it had a few niggling disappointments that contributed to a watering down of the final product.I found that the tone set in the opening scenes - including the credit sequence - was spot on. You were pulled instantly into the time line (again, something best appreciated by those familiar with the story already) and between the still photos and a surprisingly apt soundtrack, the sadness of the deterioration of the 'glory days' of the Minutemen was palpable. And after that, there were a number of moments where the tone seemed pitch-perfect - due in large part to the incredible care taken to directly transpose entire scenes from the novel directly to the screen - Rosarch's first visit with Dreiberg being a perfect example.The characters again were transposed to the screen with incredible faithfulness to the source material (for the most part). They managed to somehow keep a veneer of the comic book sheen - see Nixon, for example - while making these people incredibly real. Dreiberg and Rosarch, again, perfect examples of the written characters, both their physicality and personality, jumping straight out of the book. Amazing performances from both of them as well.And I think, in the end, it's *because* of this fastidious faithfulness that, when something doesn't quite fit, it really jars you. My main point of contention is the casting of Veidt. It was no mistake that the original character had the strong chiseled features and physique of a classic Greek hero, and this was something that simply didn't make it across for me. It's a shame too, as he's such a pivotal character. It's so crucial to get the message across that he had done what he's done out of a *love* of humanity, and that he is calmly, quietly *proud* of his work. But it just didn't fly.My other 'issues' were fairly minor - a wholly unnecessary sex scene up in Archie (with an especially ill-fitting backing track - at least the Cohen version of it...), a surprisingly high-pitched delivery from Dr. Manhattan which took a bit of time get used to, and a slightly goofy 'cameo' moment from a certain diminutive actor who I was most familiar with from sitcoms. Me, I would've tried to cast him as a short Teller, but what do I know.So yeah - full points for what they wanted to do, but the deeper message within the original story lost a lot of its impact for little reasons. Too bad, they very nearly got it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Fantastically written- well worth sneaking into seeing,"Being a fan of David Hayter's writing, I was a little biased about my view on the movie. However this thankfully did not affect how I saw the movie and in fact exceeded my expectations.I originally walked in thinking I was going to see a movie like Spider-man and Batman. However, I actually saw something beyond that. It's actually more political than an action movie and I think that's what made the movie enjoyable.

Why is there so much hate?,"This has to be one of the most mixed reviewed movies of all time along with Passion of the Christ and Snyder's own 300. I really loved watching this and didn't really get bored even though it is 2 hours and 40 minutes long. Jackie Earle Haley's Roarshach was one of the most bad ass characters that I have ever seen in a movie. He was definitely the best part of the movie and all his scenes get your attention. I thought that Billy Crudup made Dr. Manhattan a very interesting character, Patrick Wilson's Nite Owl was also very interesting as was Matthew Goode as Ozy, and Morgan was perfect as The Comedian who was the most unlikeable ""hero"" ever in a movie. A lot of people think Ackerman was terrible and while she wasn't very good she was OK. I enjoyed Dawn of the Dead and thought 300 was alright but this is snyder's best movie so far and everyone should see it just because it's such a cool looking movie and Roarshach deserves his own movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Tonight, a comedian died in New York.","Where do I begin?First let me address all the disappointed movie goers in the audience. I'm sorry that this movie's plot was too ""confusing"". I'm sorry that you couldn't appreciate the fine acting, writing or directing. I'm sorry that you're offended by sex and violence. Maybe if you petition Hollywood all the production companies will from now on be required to release fresh sh't that everyone seems to eat up.Second I'd like to address the Alan Moore extremist, F'ck off. Snyder was what, like 95% accurate to the book? Would you prefer that Aaronofsky was given the directing role and turned it into some post 9/11 bullsh't? Wouldn't it have been swell to see our beloved Dr. Manhattan combating some mutant Osama Bin Laden?! I know right, the thought alone brings me to the verge of climaxing.

True to its origins,"I don't think that Watchmen creator Alan Moore could find much to complain about in this rendition of his best-selling graphic novel. Neither will it disappoint moviegoers. It's packed with enough action, romance, and conspiracy to make sure of that.Throughout the first half of the movie, it seems almost a frame-for-frame copy of the graphic novel that started it all (except for the pirate sub-plot, which will be available as a separate animated movie). While this is sure to please the purists, I found the inclusion and precise plotting of the film to be sometimes tedious and sometimes smacking of artistic cowardice. Movies need to respect the original books from which their inspired, but they also need to introduce something new--and that shouldn't just be graphics and special effects.I guess I left the theater dissatisfied because I wanted a little more. I wanted the movie to answer some long-nagging questions, such as how does Rorsarch's mask work? I also wanted it to add narrative flashbacks to the characters instead of relying so heavily on character conversation.

Well, that is what watching this film feels like.I have not read the comic book, and probably never will, but it seems a lot of the film I spent questioning things: do these guys have super powers or are they just lush at fighting? why does the blue guy spend most of the time naked?",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A masterpiece,"For a few years now Hollywood has effectively been driving a silver stake through the heart of superhero movies by flogging them to death. ""Watchmen"" is a movie which isn't devalued by being released after a spate of superhero movies. For some reason, I've been watching these superhero movies. Sure, I like them, but how many of them have repeat viewing value? Not ""Hulk"", but ""Hancock"" definitely. In children's movies, ""The Incredibles"" was terrific. Not ""The Dark Knight"" either, though Heath Ledger's ""The Joker"" was the sum total of that movie's greatness.Of all the superhero movies I've seen, ""Watchmen"" is the ONLY one I'd call great. The rest look boys' own adventures in comparison.""Watchmen"" will not be a movie for everybody. It's hardcore in parts. Here, in Australia, it is rated ""MA"". In my view, an ""R"" rating is warranted. There are scenes in this movie that would not look out of place in ""The Texas chainsaw massacre"" or ""The day of the dead"" or ""Taxi driver"". Perhaps its gore is on a par with the terrific ""Sin City"". The camera does not blink-there is much strong and bloody violence in this movie. Apart from the gore, there are also brutal fight scenes. No punches are pulled.There is full frontal male nudity and sex scenes. ""Watchmen"" is also not an ideal 'chick flick' either, as there is a strong rape scene in this movie.So, it's not my intent to put you off seeing this movie. Quite the opposite. Just be prepared for something a lot darker than ""The Dark Knight"". And if my preceeding descriptions of the movie have got you salivating with anticipation, then there is the flipside of this movie...it does try and get profound. More often than not, movies which try and do this bore one witless (as a kid, I remember ""Star Trek: The motion picture"" being a terminable bore). However, the intellectual musings of this movie work well...just be aware that it is in this movie, and if it not for you, you will have to wait a while for the 'good stuff'...though the opening of the movie does constitute 'the good stuff' too.OK, how to liken this movie to others which may be touchstones for you? Think of it as part ""Apocalypse now"" (for the philosophising on the dark side of man), ""2001: A space odyssey"" (for general philosophising and delving into 'The Profound') and ""Sin City"" or ""Taxi driver"" for graphic violence.No, ""Watchmen"" is not a movie for the kiddies. It is a very adult movie. It can be confronting if you are lulled into a false sense of security about superhero movies based on what you've recently seen.Without going into the plot too much, it concerns a dystopian world where superheroes are being murdered for some unknown reason, by someone unknown. Having superheroes in a world can't but change the world...in this world, those changes include President Richard Nixon not leaving the White House in disgrace and hence continuing his term for another four years or more.And the superheroes who do inhabit this world give rise to thoughts in the viewer: what is a superhero? Who is a superhero? As far as superheroes go, there is a colourful gang in this movie. Are some/none of them worthy of the moniker ""superhero""?About a week before I saw this film, I bought the comic book it was based on. Did not read it before watching this movie. So, I'm unbiased towards the movie in that I have no preconceptions as to what the movie has to live up to. Like ""The Incredibles"", having no great expectations for this movie allowed me to find the greatness in it, without being disappointed by any hype it may have had, or preconceptions. This movie did not disappoint...it exceeded all my expectations. Only a few cheesy glances between some characters struck the wrong note with me. Not enough to put me off this movie.This movie deserves some Academy Award attention in 2009, I think. Like ""Best film"", ""Best adapted screenplay"" etc. A cast of unknowns does justice to the terrific story.Unlike other superhero movies, this is a movie that will reward repeated viewings. It's depth assures that.Essential viewing...for adults. Enjoy the stunning opening to this movie...and the great music which is employed throughout it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

A new perspective of vigilantes,"If you got tired of movies in which only special effects are the attractive, Watchmen is a suitable option. The film reflects that we can never entirely leave our past behind, because sooner or later we'll have to meet again with it. The main characters are very realistic, because they don't fight crime because it's their responsibility or for defending justice, they do it because they're as twisted as the enemies they fight, or because they have serious self esteem issues, so they feel better killing and fighting, even torturing. The heroes are the villains at the same time. Particularly, Rorschach is the best character. He is a psycho-vigilante that won't be tolerant with the scum that surrounds him, so he behaves extremely violent with it because he knows the society is doomed. As a plus, the violent fight scenes are greatly filmed, just like in 300. It will probably be one of the best films of 2009.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Not as good as the book, but still worthwhile","After watching the watchmen on opening day, I have to say that this movie is good, but it's no ""Dark Knight"" as some fanboy's would have you believe. The first thing that I have to say is please don't take young children who love comics and super heroes to this movie, this is like ""300"" meets a much darker and more explicit version of ""the Dark Knight"", along with a large amount of frontal nudity.I'll start with the great and gradually move down to the ugly. One of the things that I like the most about this movie is it's amount of respect to the original novel while still giving the story it's own spin. As many of you have probably heard, the ending has been changed, but in the way it has been changed does not hurt the story, but helps it. The new ending makes more sense and also fits in better with the plot. I also believe that the casting was spot on, when you look at these characters from the novel, and then look at them from the movie, you can't really tell the difference. I was amazed that when I looked at these people I saw the Comedian and Silk Spectre instead of actors playing them. I also thought that this movie had beautiful design, direction, and cinematography. When it comes to cinematography, 10/10.Although Watchmen had great casting for the most part, one character bugged me just a bit, and that was actually Silk Spectre II, or Laura. At times the writing made her dialogue come off as cheap and flat. However, for the most part this did not happen, just in a few scenes. I also thought that Snyder added a little to much gore, which is why this movie reminded me a little to much of 300. Gore was even added in places that it wasn't needed such as in a fight scene that takes place in an alley. I also thought that Snyder added a little to much nudity to this movie, not that it bugged me, but it got kinda annoying and pointless when we got to see a 2 minute long sex scene, I didn't know if I was watching a movie or a porno.There is really very little that I can say is bad about this movie, beside from some of the makeup being to obvious (Sally Jupiter). To be honest with you the only character that didn't come off as spot on was Nixon, especially with a giant fake nose on his face that made him look like a cartoon character. The only other thing that I can think of that hurt this film was it's lack of central plot. I know that I'm about to get ripped apart by fans and non fans alike, but after reading the graphic novel a few months ago, I could already tell you what this movies downfall would be. What works in a comic book doesn't always work in a movie. I could tell that people in the audience didn't like that the movie would have about 10 different subplots running at the same time, and then suddenly, at the very end we would jump back to the original plot.So, in my opinion, watchmen was a good film, besides it's lack of clear storyline. Most of the Dialouge and casting was great, loved the drama/action parts. However, this isn't going to be 2009's Dark knight box office record breaker, if we even have one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Never intended for mass audience consumption,"I think one of the most beautiful ironies in recent memory is how the Psychologist in Watchmen was driven insane by digging into Rorscarch's psyche, just as normal American families were driven insane because they went to Watchmen with their kids not knowing they were entering the mind of Alan Moore. Thats something that most people are not ready for/never will be ready for, and its the biggest reason a Watchmen movie could never work as a mass audience film especially when literally interpreted from the source. Alan Moore goes to dark places when he writes, he asks tough questions, and his writing is both shocking and disturbing on many levels, and it contains a whole lotta truth. If there is one thing the average person cannot handle and does not want ANY part of, its the truth, in any form, and especially not in their 'entertainment'.There was no way Watchmen could ever be 'dumbed down' enough for it to appeal to a wide audience, thats not was it was ever intended to do. This movie is true to the book on some levels, it has truth, its dark and its disturbing. So why did Hollywood try and market it as just another super hero movie like the Dark Knight, as if to say it might be something you could take your kids to see? I have no idea, it is probably the biggest movie marketing blunder I have seen in a long time.This movie fails because it does not capture the essence of the characters, the only one it gets close to doing so with is Rorschach, (and you just know that Hollywood execs are right now trying to figure out a way to make a Rorschach prequel movie, PG rated of course.) But so little time is spent on character development for the rest of the characters that they come off as flat as a cardboard cutouts.I'm not saying the movie is a disaster, but it doesn't do what the book did in terms of the way it made you think and feel, and isn't that the point? If they could not translate that to film, then the other alternative should have been considered which was to make the Watchmen into an ordinary superhero team and give them an adventure to go on like the Avengers or Justice League. Quite frankly, much as that would have been a bastardization of the source material, it would have been more entertaining than what we ended up with.All the slo-mo action in the world could not smooth over the problems associated with a 'book to film' project like this, but I'm sure thats how Zack Snyder and co sold the idea to the big wigs. Only someone as young and inexperienced as Snyder could have the ego to think that making a movie like this and have it appeal to a wide audience was a realistic goal. I suspect he will be far more careful and 'Michael Bay' like in choosing his projects in the future.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Watchmen Ultimate Cut, a dark and stylish neo-noir superhero film","""It was dark when the murderer got back, as dark as it can get.""
Zack Snyder have created a dark, very stylish and visual masterpiece of a neo-noir superhero film but is it a good Watchmen adaption? Yes and no. This film has everything Watchmen should have, spectacular acting for the troubled characters and also almost image by image from the panels. But he missed the mark that made the original graphic novel the big thing it was and it was of course the ending and the whole nuclear war/doomsday that people were scared of but it was actually better in the director's cut/Ultimate cut, the new Watchmen show hit the mark with tackling racism in Tulsa. If you don't mind that then this is a masterpiece in the superhero genre. What Zack failed to do was to delve into the story and really make it matter, but as past directors and filmmakers said it was unfilmable and Zack did his best and succeeded in a way.
People could say the Black Freighter doesn't have to be in the movie and that's true but what it help tell in the graphic novel is that it mirrors the Watchmen story in a way that I don't spoil. So it is important but not needed so I recommend the Director's cut for the usual viewer and the Ultimate cut for the big fans. Another thing about the Black Freighter scenes is that it shows the life of a newspaper salesman and a teenager reading the comic and with that we get to see how the world in their eyes and not the vigilantes we follow, which goes deeper in the fear of nuclear war.There's many parts of the movie that are simply excellent and the ensemble cast and the performances they gave is one of the best things of the movie. Malin Åkerman, Matthew Goode, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Patrick Wilson all did spectacular performances and captured their graphic novel counterparts. But the best performance of the movie is Jackie Earle Haley as Walter Kovacs/Rorschach, he captures everything that makes the character awesome and makes it so believable, truly one of the best performances I have ever seen. You can say that to a lot of actors in this movie, they brought their A game. Rorschach is also my favorite character in the Watchmen graphic novel and movie, he also have one of my favorite movie scenes. ""Men get arrested, dogs get put down"" that whole scene is simply incredible.
The fight scenes are hyper-violent, so really bloody and brutal. That can be off putting for some, I like it though. The fight choreography is great though.
The costume department, practical sets and props are simply perfect. Everything looks like the 80's so everything is authentic to the time period, the costumes are my favorite as the vigilantes costumes are just incredible. Not really comic accurate but more realistic and safe.To finish of the review I want to say that this is my opinion and you the reader might have a completely different perspective and opinion on the movie, and I get it that this isn't a movie for everyone. But you have to give Zack Snyder a plus for making it visually stunning with his stylish directing and not changing too much except for certain minor things and a different ending. The theatrical cut is fine but the director's cut is superb, ultimate cut is for fans of the movie and graphic novel.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A modern classic.,"In an alternate timeline, Nixon is still president and the world is sinking under the pressure of a cold war against Russia. A faded gang of superheroes lay dormant until one of their own is murdered, prompting an investigation that leads to a startling discovery about the future of the world and what the cost of peace and the salvation of mankind may be.As director Zack Snyder's first film with actual characters in it, ""Watchmen"" takes its time in building a back-story for its broad range of colorful characters and misfits, and is all the better for it. The narrative bounces back and forth between the past and the present (which, as it turns out, is a fictional 1985) and yet, through the 162 minutes the film takes to reach its point, it never lets up for one minute or becomes a chore to watch. Truly, this is one film where you won't want to miss a minute, with each scene carrying as much weight and relevancy as the next. While the material at hand is very dark and mature, and even though it won't appeal to a younger or more mainstream audience, it is certainly a film that functions on multiple levels.The film is chockfull of excellent performances from its cast, but it is Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach who stands out from the pack. This brilliant casting choice creates an iconic character that, many years down the line, the film will be remembered primarily for. As for direction, Snyder flexes his cinematic muscle with enough caffeinated action and jarring visual effects to match wits with the dense plot at hand, in turn, making this his finest film to date. Sure, there is a plethora of directors who could have tried their hand at this material, some perhaps more qualified, but Snyder's film is both classy and stylish and, in a nutshell, as close to perfection as it gets. It's an assault on the senses as well as the psyche, and perhaps one of the darkest superhero tales of our time, translated flawlessly to film.""Watchmen"" might not be enough to pacify one of its creators, but the purists and movie-lovers alike will find it a rare treat in film-making where a film based on a graphic novel or comic book can capture its source material so beautifully while simultaneously stimulating and satisfying those who are not already initiated. ""Watchmen"" is one of those films that, as we look back on this decade in the future, will be talked about and remembered fondly as a definitive film for its era. This is not just one of the finest films of the year, but also one of the best of its kind.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Simply a Masterpiece,"In the 1980s, Alan Moore helped comics come of age. He created adult story lines of great complexity, filled with profound and sometimes unsettling ideas. Hollywood has consistently botched these ideas with the likes of Constantine, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and the uneven V for Vendetta.Until now.This is a film you must see. Right from the opening tiles, where an alternate history of a USA full of costumed (and sometimes psychopathic) superheroes unfolds to the songs of Bob Dylan, this is Alan Moore's ""Watchmen"" as it was intended to be. The filmmakers have preserved exactly the spirit of the original. If you're looking for The Matrix, you will be disappointed, because this film is better than that. It is at once profound, eloquent, complex and visually stunning, action-packed, gory and beautiful.The script manages to distill the best moments from the comic books and make the overall theme clearer. Fine acting from all the leads, a brilliant soundtrack that borrows from the likes of Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, Leonard Cohen and even Koyaanisqatsi, reveals the true reverence the filmmakers have for the original graphic novel. Forget the muddied philosophising of The Dark Knight, this is Hollywood at its best - insightful, thoughtful, dramatic and exciting.Go see this film...then go read the book.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Who Watches the Watchmen? We Should,"Personally, I was not anticipating Watchmen quite as much as my friends. They all read the cultish DC Comics graphic novel while I hadn't. It seems that everyone who reads it somehow has a life changing experience. I went to the packed midnight showing of its release, surrounded by college students, with hope that the film adaptation would prove the same for me. I have a personal affinity with comic books and superhero movies, but until Watchmen I'd never seen a true comic book film. Through stunning visuals it goes above and beyond, making the superhero film into the piece of art it always should have been.It opens with a chilling scene of a vicious super powered fight, backed by Nat King Cole's gentle ""Unforgettable."" The story revolves around the mystery of who killed the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a former costumed ""superhero"" and former member of the disbanded Watchmen. We follow the vigilante Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley), another former Watchman, who investigates the murder case. The story behind the Comedian unfolds through a series of flashbacks revealing only more puzzling information. Watchmen takes us to an alternate 1985 in which America won the Vietnam war and Nixon is in his fifth term. The story does not raise this film above the standard by itself, but it does so through the themes, issues, and questions it calls to mind.The film contains excusable infractions from the poor makeup job of Nixon's nose to the awkward and laughable sex scenes. I couldn't stand the use of Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"" to score the sex scene between Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman) and Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson). The context of its use turned a sweet ballad into what sounded like a sexified, Barry White-esquire rendition. If anything the audience found amusement at the awkwardness of the creative sexual encounters; it's uncomfortable but entertaining.Underlying the film are thought provoking themes other superhero movies don't dare to explore. It redefines the ""superhero"" from savior to human, not only in the realm of making mistakes but the capacity to do wrong. Other films barely touch on this idea from Spider-man's human weaknesses to Batman in Dark Knight straddling the line between hero and vigilante, but they're both inherently good. The audience doesn't disagree with their actions or motives. The ""heroes"" in Watchmen prove that though they save the day, they can be just as selfish, unforgiving, and murderous as those who oppose them. It makes the point that every hero is one choice away from becoming a ""villain."" Heroes can't always make the right choice. As Rorschach says oh so poetically, ""Humans are savage in nature."" I'm afraid that some casual viewers of Watchmen didn't quite appreciate or grasp the concepts that I found so intriguing. They were too distracted by Dr. Manhattan's glowing blue penis, the apparent ""randomness"" of the music choices, and the lengthiness of the film. I barely noticed the nudity because I was too distracted by the characters and social commentary. The music suited the time period and captured the intended emotions, and I never once wondered when the movie was going to end. I suppose this extreme thematic exploration is a little out of its time for some, especially for those who have not read the original graphic novel.Viewers agree that the look of the film made an impression. Even if they don't enjoy the mystery or the damned but redeemable characters, the visuals are truly stunning and hypnotic. Director Zack Snyder caters to comic readers by striving for artistic mimicry in imitating specific panels from the graphic novel. The drastic color scheme creates a mesmerizing, innovative style, pleasing to the eye and reminiscent of comic art. The visual approach is apparent from the opening credit sequence. Through iconic, almost photographic stills Snyder elegantly presents the superheroes' history. It effectively introduces the audience to the world of the Watchmen. Brutal violence is beautified through split second slowmo shots to enhance powerful punches and emphasize the bright, agonizing gore. The fight scene choreography feels like watching a comic book in action, showing the audience every hit, every bullet wound, every blood splatter. The film utilizes its parent text by truly capturing the comic book on screen.Whether it's colorful, chilling scenes of graphic violence, various ex-superheroes representing the best and worst of humanity, or a whodunit mystery, Watchmen proves to be a ride of pure adrenaline. It'll make you squirm, laugh, gasp, and most importantly think. In a flashback, the Comedian says, ""I thought I knew how the world was"" but none of us seem to know. Watch the Watchmen and maybe you'll feel enlightened, maybe disturbed, but it'll make you feel. Not only is it a must see; it's worth re-watching.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A nice illustration for a great book,"If you are going to make a movie based on a great novel which you love you have two ways to go. First, you can try to follow the text as close as you can and create an illustration. This is what Zack Snyder has done in Watchmen. There is also another way, which is to recreate everything from zero and push beyond the limits of the original. A very risky approach which the fans would most likely condemn. Andrei Tarkovsky did it with the Roadside Picknick (a great science fiction novel by Strugatsky brothers) to create his Stalker. And this is to me the main difference: In Stalker we have an ingenious new creation while Watchmen is only a perfect illustration.After saying all this I can mention that Snyder's picture is of a very high quality, the acting is very good (especially, Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach and Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl), and the soundtrack is quite extraordinary. I would give it 8 if it would not have little mess with the ending.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Loved Watchmen,"I can't say enough about Watchmen. There was moments in the movie where i was a little confused on why things were happening and what was going on, but it all makes sense in the end. I have not read the GN yet, but just as a movie, I thought Watchmen was phenomenal. I went with four of my friends. We are all about 18. Three of us are into movies and pretty mature, and the other two aren't so much. The two immature kids walked out of the movie saying ""That was F^$%#&# weird!!"" The other three of us however loved it. In the words of my one friend, ""it is more philosophical than The Bible"" (exaggeration). Some things i would've changed about it. The beginning when they are showing all the old Watchmen as the credits are going. It seemed like it was meant to be comical and that really wasn't the vibe of the movie, especially the music that was playing. Also, the sex scene was about five minutes too long.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
An authentic adaptation that stands well on its own as an action film with some depth,"As someone who didn't find the Watchmen story met the hype in the graphic novel, the film was a pleasant surprise, and I definitely enjoyed it more than the book. Snyder hits all the points in the comic book very faithfully, and makes the story a bit clearer in its character focus. The action is extremely well shot, and nails the comic book, over the top aesthetic. Because it is such a faithful adaptation, many of my problems with the story of the book carry over here, but I do think we get a clearer sense of Veidt's goals throughout and thought Laurie's backstory and character was more emotionally engaging in the film. It is really strange to me that this movie wasn't more beloved, especially by critics - people really adore the graphic novel, and this is a very faithful adaptation of it which I think improves on it in a few areas, and yet it is rarely mentioned. The story isn't as captivating for me as most, but this is still a movie well worth watching for the world building and action sequences.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A Really Amzaing Experience!!!!!,"OK, i'm gonna try keep this short, I just saw this on a late night session and i have to say this film was great!!The visuals were quite outstanding and beautiful, and the fight scenes were really cool and bloody at times!!!I just don't know what to say anymore on this beautiful film!!!Haven't even read the graphic novel yet but its still awesome to see it if you haven't.So, if your wanting to see a film with beautiful visuals, awesome characters, some lots of blood, gore and sex. Then Watchmen will keep you satisfied!!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A different comic experience,"The movie 'Watchmen' is a great piece of visual media very carefully adapted from a great visual comic. The details of the movie depict how thought-out the cinematography of the movie was. It is a highly graphic adaptation that leaves no scenes to spare. The movie is paced quite well, the first half of the movie felt like a breeze however towards the end it got a little hard to keep up with which might be different for everyone depending on your expectations from the film.The most striking feature of the movie to me was the soundtrack and the sound effects used. The soundtrack of the movie has a wide range which is very carefully picked out to set the mood of the film and some songs you could add to your playlist. The song 'The Times They Are A Changin'' by Bob Dylan in the intro was a great way to start the film as the movie shows us a different light than which we usually see villains and superheroes in. The movie also features other more vibrant songs used in the past scenes or action scenes. The funeral scene was a key moment that caught my eye with the use of a great song 'The Sound of Silence' and its use of different techniques which I will mention later. The sound cuts in the movie were very abrupt but necessary as they showed the quick change of scenes quite similar to actual comic books.With that, I think the great adaptational skills of the makers can be seen in the form of action scenes in the movie which include a lot of blood and gore graphically which is used more easily in the comic. In the action scenes, the use of weapons is shown very clearly and even the sequences are very comic-like in the way the attacks are shown. The way the funeral scene was directed also felt like it was straight out of the comic book for me. The smiley badge of the Comedian being tossed into the grave with the camera panning to the Night Owl. Comic books have more freedom to work more creatively in the sense that they can merge reality and fantasy without the consequences of creating a somewhat believable reality. An example of that can be Dr Manhattan's character, who can be hard to bring to life without the use of an enormous amount of visual effects.Symbolism is another quite prominent feature of the film. The most visible example of the symbolism is the use of the smiley badge in several scenes from beginning to end. It can be seen in the blood splatter on the smiley badge at the start to somewhere in the middle with Dr Manhattan's creation being a smiley face as well and the end with the guy in a smiley face shirt having a red splatter of ketchup on his shirt. The symbol is similar to the signature symbols of superheroes like the bat signal in Batman. The symbolism of emotion can also be seen in the cinematography of the movie. In the past scenes, a warm tone is used to show a happier and stronger bond between the group, and the present is shown with cooler and darker tones depicting the grim reality the group and the society are faced with.My only complaint with the movie comes from the fact that I expected more of a satire about the actual reality of what superhero films tend to ignore. The only time there was some of that was when the comedian said, ""Everything is a joke."" For me, the film focused more on the glorification of the Watchmen rather than highlighting the satirical aspects of superhero films.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Against the consensus.,"Against the consensus, but hey! First of all, let me begin by informing you all that I have not read the graphic novel. I have no prior knowledge of these characters, or the story. I deliberately ignored all reviews about the film, and kept an open mind as I do regularly.I'll start with the acting. Wilson was reasonably convincing in the role of Dan, as was Morgan in the role of Eddie Blake. Both actors played their parts well, and convinced me that they were super heroes for the duration. One performance, however, stood out. A straight mile above the rest was Jackie Earle Haley in the role of Rorschach. His acting was astounding, and I felt an attachment to this character by the end of the film. It was the only performance I feel that deserves anything in the form of high praise.I am the belief that the story was unsuitable for the big screen. It felt almost as random and pointless as 'The Spirit', and I was equally bored and bewildered throughout. I'm all for a far fetched story, but Dr Manhattan's back story, and character as a whole seemed on a par with that of a five year old's art-class project. The story failed to command my attention, and I was furious with the way it ended.Overall, I'm sure this film is excellent if you're a fan of the graphic novel. However, be warned If you've never read it before, you're in for a shock; and it probably won't be a good one.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Pleasantly Surprised,"(Too tired to retype here is what I put on my blog.)-Short Version-Well it is Tuesday and I am happy to report that the director didn't rape the source material as bad as Indiana Jones was raped by George Lucas. But the film still seemed lacking.-Long Version-First and foremost the movie is definitely not for kids. Zack Snyder seems to take the source material seriously without fluffing it up. (and yes that means Dr. Manhattan's penis is flopping around for all to see.) The cg was amazing at times and made you suspend belief as you watched the characters history unfold throughout the movie. I don't believe Alan Moore will ever watch the movie but he should be pleased to know that his political under tones and many aspects that made the book unique were left in.All in all it was a good movie but the source material seemed very difficult to translate into cinema. My only wish was that the movie was longer so it could have had more room to grow.Liked-Loved Computer Graphics-Imperfect Characters-True to source materialDisliked -A couple of the costumes reminded me of batman and robin.-At times the violence made me cringe, i.e. brutal rape scene. ( hey I said it wasn't for kids.)-Some of the makeup on the minor characters could have seen a little more detail-Movie was missing the comic within comic Tales of a Black Freighter",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Well, hmm. . . Yeah!!!","Since the very first murmur of ""Watchmen"" being made into a movie, there has been doubt and excitement running around my mind. Doubt, the graphic novel, as many have said, is cruel, down to earth, incredibly dense, and a lot to take in. I heard it described as the riskiest super hero movie, ever to be made. Plus the ending of the film is not for the ""Spiderman"" and ""Fantastic 4"" lovers. It's incredibly (love that word) dark, and esoteric in its own sense. Those were my only doubts. My excitement, coming from mostly Zach Snyder, possibly one of my all time favorite director, which each of his films play through my mind constantly. I sometimes watch each one several times a week, just to psycho-analyze it. (yes, I'm a film maker)And he makes a lot of smart moves in difficult places. The other thing, getting me pumped was. . . well. . .Rorschach, I know, I'm a sucker for a bad ass, but he was one a huge part of me seeing the movie. I didn't even pay any mind to the ""R"" rating until the movie started and went ""Woah, how Snyder-esquire"" And Snyder used the crap out of his ""300"" style fighting. Bad thing? not necessarily, it's almost his signature in a way. . . Before I go any further, I just have to ask. . What the hell is with the soundtrack. I don't think I've ever seen a soundtrack. . . as unique as this. I can see what was trying to be done with it, and I'm all for dark humor, and that form of Sarcasm, but the silly music got old after a while. There could have been a better soundtrack for this movie, obviously, me, being a metal-head, could have definitely used a little metal, and heavier music. But seeing as it didn't happen, I'll stop with the ""What If's"" and move on. The Special effects were jut wonderful, if I ever get excited for a movie, I usually look up info, and videos prior to the release of said film, and I sometimes learn a lot about how it's made. And I have to say, Zach Snyder has always been very revolutionary with his tactics, but this film took it to a new level. The whole time before the movie came out, I was wondering how they would do Rorshach's ever changing mask. Or Dr.Manhattan's. . . glowiness. . .ess. One thing about Manhattan, erm, nudity, was that it wasn't overly accentuated, or wasn't trying to be made vague either, which was very well done. It was a subtle mix between ""in your face""(hahaha) ""Don't look at his wiener"". The violence can be described only as. . . gratuitous (another great word). Again, staying true to the Snyder mantra. It was at time, a bit over done, the prison arm-cutting scene. Made me cringe and smile at the same time. Not a lot of violent scenes can make me cringe. (I'm a Saw fan. . .soooo)Manhattan exploding people was a little twisted (loved it) and Rorshach's less than heroic tactics of disposing of villains. This all spelled ""R"" ( Not to mention the porno-like ""300"" style sex scene)But, then again, I don't think a film adaption of Watchmen could be any other rating. In the end, I'm not going to go to deep into it, but I was very impressed with it, not only as a standalone film, but also as a wonderful adaption. Zach Snyder, my good friend. . . Keep it up. :D -Sam Miller",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Yes, you should watch the Watchmen","Watchmen is certainly not your typical comic book movie. The first hint of this is that nobody calls the original source material a comic book. It's a graphic novel thank you very much. This implies a certain weight, gravity and seriousness. And it also indicates the reverence fans had for the material. Long deemed unfilmable Watchmen would require not just a very talented director but a brave one. Zack Snyder was up to the task. The film he produced was not perfect. But with all the inherent challenges it was probably as close to perfect as one could reasonably hope. Snyder made a very entertaining, compelling and ultimately quite satisfying film.Watchmen is not an adaptation of the original printed story. It is that story brought to life lock, stock and barrel. To get the project off the ground it was deemed that adherence to the original story was paramount. And with amazing attention to detail Snyder fills the screen with every bit of that story. This makes for a very dense film. To say there is a lot going on is an understatement. It also of course makes for a very long film, clocking in either side of three hours depending on which version you're watching. But the story holds your interest throughout, with the smart cultural references sprinkled in adding more layers. There is enough big action to carry things through some of the inevitable lulls that come in a film of this length. The film looks spectacular, terrific sets and costumes make the film really pop off the screen. The myriad visual effects are very well done. The music fits in perfectly. And Snyder coaxed winning performances from his cast.There are a couple of standouts in the ensemble cast. Jackie Earle Haley does a fabulous job as Rorschach. No easy task bringing personality to a character completely hidden away behind a mask, Haley does so superbly. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is excellent as well portraying the Comedian, showing a somewhat less heroic side to the hero. All the other performers fill their roles capably if not spectacularly. The women, Malin Akerman and Carla Gugino, aren't given much to work with and it's hard to get a handle on Billy Crudup's performance at all what with our seeing a CG representation of him rather than the actor himself. But while some may be less memorable than others all the characters work, all the actors did enough to do the story justice. And what a story it is. It's a long journey in this most sprawling of comic book movies. The long trip is well worth it as the film shows why legions of fans consider Watchmen to be no mere comic book.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"unbelievable!!!  No really, It's awesome!!!","The comedian is a crime fighting superhero of the mould of Batman or Green Arrow, a mere mortal with exceptional fighting abilities, he is also about to meet his match. As his door is beaten down he is assaulted by an attacker who seems to know and counter all of his best moves, and they are pretty sweet. However after a 30 storey journey straight down to the street level the comedian is no more. This is the catalyst that drives the barely human Rorshach into action to revisit the members of his old team and try and figure out if this marks the start of an attack on all his old team members from the defunct superhero team ""Watchmen"".Many films these days are over-hyped, dumbed-down or are turned into incomprehensible garbage, and while I heaped praise on ""Batman Begins"" my feelings on the ""Dark Knight"" are well known. Unlike Dark Knight, this hasn't been hyped to hell, nobody died before it came out so people's views aren't clouded by sympathy, and, unlike Dark Knight, I didn't really like the comic book. Yes, you heard right, I was not a fan of ""Watchmen"". Whilst the writing was okay (I preferred Moore's other works like ""Halo Jones"") the artwork was quite static and I found that lack of dynamism off-putting (Gibbons women look like men in drag!)Add to the that the fact that the film had been branded ""Unfilmable"" due to the size of the original text, and due to the persnickety nature of the audience, it was likely that the books fans would have a go at the film for being not enough like the graphic novel or too much like the graphic novel and you've got a tight rope it is virtually impossible for the director, Zack Snyder, to navigate successfully.So let's get to the guts of it. Is ""Watchmen"" any good.If I was Alan Moore I'd start dancing in the street right about now. ""Watchmen"" the movie takes the original ideas, too grounded in a desire to be real in the novel, and lets them take flight on the big screen. The action sequences are awesome, with a great blend of the realistic consequences of violence, which Moore wanted in the original text, mixed with dynamic cinematic editing and framing to make them exciting to watch. Much of the dialogue and the best cinematic shots are taken directly from the source, but look so much better on the big screen. It was like the ideas in the comic-book, belonged here all the time, but on the page, they were too restricted, (the dialogue sounding especially good from the mouths of these character actors.)Perhaps the masterstroke here though is with the no-star cast we have no baggage from previous roles, no ""oh, that's George Clooney as Rorsharch"" or ""Russell Crowe as Nite Owl"", etc. You accept the actors because nothing tells you that you are watching a movie, you are simply watching a huge story unfold before your eyes.I went to see this with a friend who nothing of the comic book and he loved it, I knew the original source but was not particularly a fan, and loved it. Obviously there are a few minor changes (In a way the big change is actually cleverer device than what happens in the original story!) but these were of the kind comparative to the subtle changes in Shawshank, nothing worth writing home about.Is it the greatest comic book adaptation of all time? I don't know, but it was a brave move by the studio and a ballsy piece of direction by Zack Snyder that has put this hype-played-down, superhuman-visual-treat in cinemas for the world to enjoy.I hope you do, as I know I will again.Joyous.Nuff said!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Powerful on visuals and performances, deeply flawed on storytelling","From director Zack Snyder, the man behind the visually stunning historical epic '300', comes a dark, complex vigilante thriller based on the acclaimed comic book series by DC comics. This film set in 1985 during the height of the Cold War, follows a league of superheros: masked vigilante Rorschach (played by Jackie Earle Haley), techno expertise Nite Owl II (played by Patrick Wilson), glowing blue- skinned being Dr. Manhattan (played by Billy Cruddup), Silk Spectre II (played by Malin Akerman), and former black-ops specialist known as The Comedian (played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan); who are shut down by the government after a political meltdown. However, when one of their former members is brutally murdered, the superheros step out of retirement to solve the mystery behind the criminal responsible of this horrendous act. On the other hand, their investigation is challenged when tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union heat up to the point of an anticipated nuclear world that is set to devastate the world.This is not your average superhero film that some come to expect. Instead of glamorizing with flashy action sequences and profound special effects, this film conveys a dark tone that makes even other DC films like the Dark Knight trilogy seem light-hearted, and dwells heavily on plot development with action making up only a minority of the storyline. This film, however, juggles two stories at the same time; one centering on the band of superheroes going under investigation of a murder of one of their own, and the other revolving around a looming global disaster by a nuclear war between two rivaling countries, with plenty of political and historical commentary, much of which is introduced in slow motion cut-outs during the opening credits with Bob Dylan's popular song "" The Times They Are Changin"" playing. The result, unfortunately, is one bloated plot that transcends into a convoluted mess. The plot move at a significantly slow pace and we are left with plenty of plot elements that never seem to add up. The connection between the government conspiracy and the murder of one of the former Watchmen is left unclear, or at least understated. Along the side, the story tosses numerous subplots to the table that fail to fit in with the main story, especially the ones dealing with the Cold War conflicts including the Vietnam War. Many may the impressive visual effects and the occasional bloody action scenes that upload in various points of the runtime. Some of the futuristic and fantasy imagery serves as eye-candy in many scenes including the stunning CGI on Dr. Manhattan's body. The performances by the cast are decent, especially by Billy Cruddup who plays Dr. Manhattan, which delivers some redeeming value to the film.Watchmen is by no means a bad film but rather one that is terribly misguided. While the visuals and performances stand strong, the film suffers greatly in terms of storytelling, thus lacking the spirit of Zack Snyder's other works. The overly complex plot may appeal to some whether or not they are able to comprehend it, but leave others sorely disappointed.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
It was a great movie,"I don't see what people are harping about. This was a great movie. Its repeat viewing material. The cast was STELLAR! The action was great, the effects were awesome, the pace was perfect, didn't feel like 2.5 hours. That is a sign when a movie is good, you don't check your watch. People single out Malin Akerman, and I don't see why they didn't like her performance. It was on par with every other performance. Jackie Earle, you are Rorschach.I've read the comics. The ending in the movie was fitting. What is the perfect ending? This came very close. I'm sorry, but this was just as good or better then The Dark Knight.I want to watch it again, I want to see the directors cut. I want to own it on Blu-Ray and watch it in IMAX. This was a movie lovers version of a comic book lovers story. Mr. Moore, it was film-able.This movie wasn't complicated to follow. How can you get lost?

One of the best movies from 2009,"I'm a huge fan of this kind of movies, being an adult and being a woman.by the time this movie was on theaters I was in living in extraordinary circumstances that made it impossible for me to watch it, but I liked it just fine in a different format.For a start, the whole thing is amazing, I'm sure just like me, those who were fans of the comics didn't felt disappointed.Every single detail were carefully added, the whole story was great, a friend who never read the comics *novel if you want* said that she didn't liked the Utopia stupid world-peace boring world they left, but it caused a very visceral response from her against it, just like the graphics did for me, it's exactly what I was expecting.Costumes, background, were as good as expected for this adaptation, but what made me cry, twice *no shame admitting it* was the soundtrack, if you had the chance to listen to it, do it.The fight among Eddie Blake and his murderer was awesome. The saw/jail scene was maybe the best one, and The Comedian is just awesome! at the end I was feeling like one of those teens that can't find another word and repeat AWESOME so many ways it lost any sense.Everything about this movie was great, even with the boring girl who played Silk Specter II (who did a great job) and lame kid who played Nite Owl II(who actually did great).Now, about the second Nite Owl, the problem is not the actor but a previous role he played, Hard Candy ruined the poor dude, just like Sleepers ruined Kevin Bacon forever more.I haven't thought once that they ruined one of the best comics ever, as I screamed they have when I first heard a movie was on the making I was prejudiced against this for so long, and now lets just remember that saying ""keep your words soft and sweet in case you have to eat them"" I give it a 9/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Love it or Hate it, maybe","For those expecting the normal comic book 'super-hero vs. super-villain' heroics and stunts, this movie is going to be quite a surprise.Most of the movie is very character oriented. Possibly more of the movie involves flashbacks into the characters' history than it show 'current time' action. Pretty much all of these flashbacks are tied to character exposition rather than striking events.The movie is very dark, and in the end, there are only a couple of characters that you have some feel you can safely like ... maybe.This is most especially NOT a movie for the kiddies to watch. Not close, no how, don't do it. It has very mature themes involving vigilantism, rape, murder, mass murder, graphic violence, nudity (male and female), strong language ... you get the drift.If I'd been sold on going to see a normal super-hero film, I'd have come out of the theater very disappointed.

Yummy self-important dialogues and numbing gore.,"I grew up a fan of most superhero comics. Now I enjoy a costumed hero movie from time to time. The Watchmen were not in my repertoire so I was curious about it. Compared with the recent burst of superhero movies, this movie was interesting in it's use of a darker, historical revisionist propaganda look with a gay-fetish twist.But interesting does not necessarily mean entertaining. It's similar to when you are dragged through the museum of the tedious and you finally see something interesting but then you want to scream and run out for the doors. The looks of this flick where cool, but that was not sufficient to carry this piece into the entertainment category. Numerous segments were tedious. For example: The constant use of self-referencing flashbacks. Another example? The over-cool, ""we are so self-important"" and humorless dialogues. Another example? The useless scenes of torture and gore. Another one? The constant use of internal jargon. The cherry on this intriguingly stale cake? The character called ""The Comedian"" was about as unfunny as they get. OK enough already.If you like movies that are self-important, disjointed and gory, this is for you. Personally, I wouldn't watch it even on video and feel it was an utter and total waste of time.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Excellent Movie for Comicbook Fans,"Watchmen was a brilliant adaptation of Alan Moore's limited series, containing enough of the original material to satisfy a dedicated Watchmen fan, but with enough variation to justify the $120 spent on filming it. It achieves the perfect balance of loyalty and creativity.I have only two problems with the film. Firstly, the film relies to heavily on the viewer having read the book. I have read the book, but I cannot imagine anybody who has not really understanding the film--too much material is cut from the film, though I look forward to seeing the director's cut when it is released on DVD.My other problem has to do with the action sequences. I felt they were too unrealistic, and that a simple introduction to Newton's laws would not only make the movie more enjoyable, but would probably be easier to film. (For example, in many of the action sequences, a punch or a kick from one of the characters will send the person being hit across a room, while the attacking character remains firmly in place.)Overall, I felt Watchmen to be an excellent adaptation of an excellent book, but I feel that it will probably only appeal to readers of the original series. (Thad doesn't mean you shouldn't see it if you haven't read the book--it means you should read one of the greatest books ever written and then go see the movie.)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
If you've read the book you'll love it...,"... Otherwise I don't know if it would work so well. I have read the book and as far as book to movie adaptations I was fairly surprised at how well this movie accomplished it. The problem is that the book was very long for a graphic novel (a great read but there was just more too it than most) so this forced a montage of back story in the beginning of the film that makes sense if you read the book but probably not as much if you haven't.I thought the cast did an amazing job portraying the characters in general but I give special props for Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) and Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) for really becoming their characters and giving impressive performances each. I also give them credit because they had possibly the two hardest characters to play in the story. Rorschach is essentially a crafty bad-ass, not like Terminator bad-ass but more subtle, as well as being psychologically damaged from a rough childhood and past experiences fighting crime. He doesn't seem deep at first glance but anyone who read the book would probably agree he's by far the most interesting character. Dr. Manhattan is also incredibly hard to play because he's a person who started out as a human being and was turned into a being who could form/rearrange matter. I thought they did a great job explaining his back-story. Everything from how he became what he is, to how the name was chosen, and even how he used his powers or how others used his powers.As far as story goes Watchmen has one of the best. It is a great character study and is really a deeply philosophical question of what is right and wrong. The big question raised at the end of the movie as well as the book is whether the end result justifies the extreme means to get there. The best part about the whole story is to this day I still don't know who I think was right and who was wrong because both sides of the story have valid arguments. Forgive me for not going deeper into this but I really don't know how to explain it without giving it away so my advise would be to read the book first if at all possible but the movie is certainly worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
wonderful,"I saw the prescreening on Tuesday night in Minnesota with about 400 other excited viewers. The scene was quite a spectacle. As this film is an adaptation of a highly followed graphic novel there is a lot of pressure for Watchmen to adhere to its roots and for the most part it has done a very good job doing so. In regard to the integrity of original characters, plot, action and point of view. The exception being the a few original characters left out and a different ending. We need to remember this is an adaptation not a remake and this adaptation is in a different medium and is trying to reach a larger more broad audience so naturally, there are going to be differences. This difference(s) become amplified if you are expecting very precise mold of the original.What I found to be a curious parallel between the graphic novel and its film counter part is, in the graphic novel a large message or concern is the growing desensitization of the public to sex and violence. The interesting part is that the film ""Watchmen"" holds so much violence and sex that is it actually serving as one of the instruments that desensitizes Americans today.In all, this film has wonderful cinematography, great action, brilliant special effects, and a good story. So if you can put down you Watchmen novel and not over compare the two so closely, this film should raise dialog and and conversation prove to be highly entertaining -",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
I watched the Watchemen,"This movie is in one word Amazing. The acting was wonderful and the story was compelling and very smart. Watchmen is not a movie for someone who is expecting a big budget action film. Watchmen is not about the action but more about the story. This movie requires a person to play close attention to literally everything, if you don't you may miss very vital information. This movies isn't about the action its about the characters, the world and above all humanity in general. To those of you who thought this movie was crap, I implore you to watch the movie again and take it for what it is a character driven movie with a damn good story.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A risk turned out fine!,"It's interesting how I got to finally watch this movie. When I saw the posters for the movie, the six main characters didn't appeal to me for some reason. I just thought ""this is another superhero movie"". Man, was I wrong. So, fast-forwarding to the last month, I decided to check it out online. The stream was so slow I barely saw around the first third of the film. I was so enticed by it I decided to buy the DVD without watching the whole thing first; not an usual thing I do, I only buy DVDs of movies I saw and liked. I wasn't disappointed. It turned out to be quite a nice surprise.Some people go as far as comparing this film to The Dark Knight. I can certainly see the ""cynicism"" and the dark overtones of both films. Both films also depict superheroes (except Dr. Manhattan) as fairly normal human beings (well, with physical prowess of top athletes though; some think like supercomputers). They are both philosophical and crude. However, The Dark Knight somewhat sticks to the good-bad formula (Batman never becomes corrupted, for instance). Watchmen goes way further into depicting heroes as more complex and morally ambiguous, like... human beings! Amazing, the first time comic characters come as close as real people.The story is also very interesting, full of layers of background history and symbolism. It has many twists and it depicts many bad choices made by the characters (they are no longer perfect). Hell, they even depict one moment of sexual frigidity! That was hilarious, and it is yet one example of how this movie rocks. It becomes a statement in itself: a human, realistic statement. Rorschach is by far the most interesting character for me; an underdog who undergoes several life changes, and becomes a ""no-bullshit, all-go"" detective type of person who, in his own words ""never compromises, not even in the face of armaggedon"". His practical approach is the best, and so is his amoral ways.Well, I've got nothing else to say that hasn't been said a thousand times before. All characters have a role and a personality (well, they could have developed Silk Spectre II more, she's kind of generic), and it mimics real history with flawed characters. A giant step in Hollywood films! 10 out of 10, without doubt.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A valiant effort,"This is hard one to describe. Looking at it coldly, it's overlong, messy, and sometimes frustratingly confusing, and yet I came out of it feeling thoroughly glad I'd seen it. I haven't read the graphic novel - as with V for Vendetta, I wanted to enjoy the film for itself without it having to live up to the original in my mind - but I look forward to doing so. From my scant knowledge of it, it sounds like a very difficult thing to adapt into a film, and I think that this actually does a reasonable job. You can feel it straining to contain its content at times, particularly in the first half, but once it gets into its swing, it begins to enjoy its own chaos, and feels more fluid. This is a flawed effort, but no less entertaining for it. It's not quite funny enough to make laughter possible, and not quite dark enough to feel truly desolate, but the balance, whilst not mind- blowingly feels-inducing, is effective, and generates a atmospheric integrity that lends weight to proceedings. The characters are intriguing, if occasionally confusing, and I appreciated the fact that I didn't recognise many faces, as this allowed characters without a greatly developed backstory to have independent weight. There are some fine performances: The Comedian stands out, as does Rorschach, despite appearing disconcertingly to use the same voice modulator as Bale's Batman. It's just a shame that the ultimate villain reveal is rather obvious from early on. Overall, despite its problems, this is a worthwhile watch because it feels like it was made with genuine heart. There is a sense that it is not quite good enough to be an unqualified success, but it also film feels as though it admits its own difficulties - it doesn't take itself too seriously, giving itself the freedom to have fun. This bravery is commendable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A breakthrough film for the comic book genre,"I don't want to give anything away, so I'll just say this: Watchmen is to comic book movies what The Clash's ""London Calling"" was to music. Not brand new... or I would have referenced The Ramones. Sin City, 300, and The Dark Knight are all precursors. But the movie is such a new amalgamation, such a new spin on an old genre, that it is kind of stunning.It's long, involved... a lot happens, and yet in other ways, very little happens. A friend told me to bring no-doze, he was so bored by it. So maybe you'll be bored, too? But if The Dark Knight got it's foot in the door on reinventing the comic book movie? Watchmen kicks the door down and deconstructs it into a gory, fascinating, piece of modern furniture.One interesting side-note. I thought as I came out the film, despite all the good work done in the past 10 years by directors like Alexander Payne, Clint Eastwood, Paul Greengrass, and others... the movies that are likely to draw the most ink or future twitters about this era - and surprisingly, with the most to say about our times - have actually been SF or comic book movies like the first two Matrix films, X-Men 2, Revenge of the Sith, TDK, and Watchmen. If I'm wrong on this, challenge me. But when was the last time you saw an indie or foreign language film with political or cultural commentary as involved as any of the aforementioned films? With the possible exception of Slumdog Millioniare, which was visually stunning. But in many ways, was almost a traditional Capraesque throwback film.Don't wait for Watchmen on DVD. Go see this in the theater and be mesmerized by everything good and bad about it. It will take you somewhere, though I can't guarantee everyone will like that. But you won't see or feel anything else like it in the theaters this year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
That was 3 hours of my life I will never get back,"After the first 10 minutes, I kept thinking ""This has GOT to get better"". I should have trusted my instincts and left the theater in time to go to ANY other show....ANYTHING would have been better then watching this - even an episode of BARNEY has to have more excitement then this complete waste of time. I have never been so bored during a movie in my life. This show has totally ruined Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"" for me too...forever. Thank goodness I only used my ""Scene Points"" to get in so I didn't pay any money at the theater. I would have been very angry if I had actually spent money to see this movie. I started feeling like Weird Al's Parody of ""One More Minute"" - I'd rather rip my heart right out of my ribcage with my bare hands and then throw it on the floor and stomp on it until I die...then spend one more minute WATCHING THIS STUPID MOVIE.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A New Kind of Superhero Movie,"I must admit, I really wasn't expecting this. I had anticipated seeing yet another ""superhero movie"" and being visually entertained for a couple hours, but this adaptation of the allegedly legendary graphic novel Watchmen far exceeded my initial expectations. David Hayter, who last wrote the first two X-Men movies, really outdid himself in writing this epic 160-minute film.Set in the 1980s, Watchmen focuses on a handful of superheroes whose servitude to the world neither seems wanted nor necessary, with the exception of the enigmatic and omnipotent Dr. Manhattan. When one of the Watchmen is murdered at the beginning of the movie, it sets the stage for a jam-packed tale centered around questions of revenge and the human condition. Unlike other superhero movies I've seen in the past, not only do you have dazzling special effects and a multitude of action sequences, but the accompaniment of blood, gore, nudity, sex, and swearing. This, coupled with the dark imagery pervading the film, does a fantastic job of making the movie an adult feature, rather than a just torrent of guys and girls in tights kicking each others' butts. Heavily emotive and extremely interesting flashbacks show the history behind the characters if you, like me, am not aware of the details behind the graphic novel (which I believe gave me a distinct advantage).The plot gives the feeling of a true crime type of movie, which further allows one to view the story as more of a tragedy than a simple action movie. The acting is particularly well done, and I was pleasantly surprised to see Jackie Earle Haley as one of the main characters (his last performance that I saw in Little Children made this role even more unexpected). The aforementioned special effects, though fantastic, don't overshadow the movie itself, and the mysterious orchestral score adds suspense and trepidation. To further the impression of a dark drama set in the past, the score is peppered with songs from Bob Dylan, Simon & Garfunkel, Jimi Hendrix, and others. Though the movie was nearly three hours long, I was never bored and yet was consciously aware of its length.All in all, I hope (and believe) that Watchmen will open the door for more mature and adult-themed superhero films with R ratings, and being the first one of its kind, does a darn good job of setting the bar for those of its kind yet to come. If you're looking for superhero action mixed with Dark Knight-styled imagery and lots of extras, you simply can't get any better than this.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Crazy Fun,"I had gone and seen this film when it first played in theaters.And I wasn't sure what it would deliver.It is the kind of superhero movie that would keep you guessing,even I don't think the comedian was the average hero.This film also has all kinds of surprises in it too.As it alternates History as well.It also has a good soundtrack to it as well.People who enjoy graphic novels can and will be pleased,but as comic book fans,they may have another point of veiw of it.The humor in it is very dark but the action is so intense. ..... ....... ...... ... ......... ...... ....... ...... ..... ....... ........ ........... .. ....... ......... .......... ...... ..... ............... ........... .......... .......... ............ ......... ........",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Unbalanced but interesting,"This one's definitely worth more than one watch. Not only does it show superheroes far more flawed, in a darker way than Hellboy does, it also shows a meticulously constructed alternative history with Nixon and Kissinger still in the 80s government.Overall the film is done very well graphically. The action scenes are spares but good while animations and backdrops are gorgeous. Costumes and atmosphere were great. A lot of classic 60s-80s songs used but it was done well. Definitely one to go see in High Definition with the best possible sound.The Watchmen are each interesting characters. The casting of each of them was pretty good overall and my favorite is Matthew Goode as Adrian Veidt, the enigmatic Ozymandias.Rorschach was too much of a walking cliché, the type of hard nosed vigilante that seems to smoke too much cigarettes to be able to talk normally. While he looks short and thin, he is way too fast and strong to be believable in this film. Earley's performance without his mask is impressive nonetheless.Like the Silk Spectre II, these characters do not really have superpowers yet they somehow beat the living hell out of any opponent with just their fists and feet. This is where the realism was lost too much at times. At times it would also get overly violent, particularly in the prison scenes related to Rorschach.Ozymandias has no real superpower other than being exceptionally bright and fast in combat while also being outrageously rich and successful.Dr Manhattan is the coolest of the Watchmen, actually being the only one to have superpowers like light speed travel, increasing/multiplying himself, manipulating matter at atomic level and what not. He also walks around naked most of the time which I thought was amusing, but does make sense from his perspective: why should he care? The combination of sadness and decreasing care for ordinary humans in his face is done well.The Comedian is killed early but with all the flash forwards and flash backs he gets plenty of screen time. Good actor too. The most insane and evil of the bunch, he is actually the only one sane enough to use fire arms. It was weird to see so few relying on them.The Director's Cut is great and pays a bit more attention to the sympathetic first Nite Owl.Say what you want but I found this film much more interesting than the overrated Dark Knight, it shows more morally grey areas while there's no clear distinction between heroes and villains.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Even a disappointment to a fan of comics and 300,First I have to say I love comic books. I read them my entire life and still do. In general I'm always interested in watching movies that are based on comic books. Since I really like the style of 300 I thought why not giving this movie a try and watch Watchmen?This is what I have to say about the movie: The plot was interesting since it had a nice twist and turn of events. I didn't read the comic book from Alan Moore before because I wanted to be surprised by the plot. I was surprised but not in a good way...Story: That said I criticize the way of telling the story. There are way too much diversions misleading the viewer from the main plot. After a while this turns out to be tiring and you get to feel the lengths of it. Zack Snyder seemed to feel the same way as he threw in some violence here and there. Perhaps to shake and wake you up anew. No prob with violence if it does make sense (like in the epic battle of 300 for example). But here it seemed really more to give the viewer a quick shock to stay focused.Action parts: I like the quickness of the action scenes. It really remembers the camera movement from 300 and also the in-Action-Slow-Motion. So the action part looks good. I didn't enjoy the music in these scenes since the music takes a bit away the thrilling part of it. Watch the opening scene with the battle of the comedian to see what I mean.Style: Hmmm here this really is a matter of taste. I didn't enjoy the costume design. Some but not all of them. It looked too much popcorn alike. I much more prefer the darker style like in Batman the dark night.All in all it's not a bad movie but because of the mentioned points a was disappointed. So what is cool about it? I liked the casting. The actors fit their roles well. I also enjoyed the short action-scenes but be prepared there is not a lot of it in that movie... What else? Good camera-work and CGI as expected. My personal opinion 6/10,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"It's true what they say. You will either not like it, or REALLY Like it.","I saw a screening of Watchmen today, and I knew walking in that the reviews were a bit mixed because of the idea of it being based off of a graphic novel. So I walked in forgetting that a novel existed, and I watched it as it's own individual movie. In this case, I happen to enjoy it very much.Why I liked this film: First off, Zack Snyder is a genius when it comes to artistic film making. His idea of fast motion to slow motion fight scenes, and artistic motion capturing is phenomenal. It felt like 300, which I assume what going to happen when they said ""Visionary director of 300"" in the trailer. Along with an artistic environment, I also enjoyed the idea of a whole bunch of new faces that Hollywood hasn't paid much attention to. It was good to see some fresh new unknown faces on screen to play these roles instead of out commonly own overused actors today. They all did great with their roles and brought some fresh blood to the movie. Overall, what keeps this movie on the positive side is it's artistic value (Just like 300).The negatives about this film: Yes I enjoyed the film, but the most important base of a film is the plot. The movie was way too plot heavy and had too much going on at once, I lost track half of the time. I also don't think they spent enough time on the past of the Watchmen, like how did they all learn to fight and get their high tech gear? truthfully, I think this film should have been split into 2 films. there would have been a lot more room for plot explanation, and a lot more could have been done. It was just too plot heavy. That's the major criticism Overall this is a good film. HOWEVER, you WILL NOT enjoy this film if you go into the theater expecting a perfect adaptation of the graphic novel because to be honest, it doesn't follow it that well. Take it for it's own movie. Go and watch it for the soul purpose of seeing it as it's own movie, not to relate it to the novel, otherwise you will not enjoy it for silly reasons.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"A beautifully, flawed, mess of a film.","First off, I'd like to bring to attention that I've never read the graphic novel, so I will not tackle what they missed, left out, or didn't get right in the translation process. Watchmen is a beautifully shot, stylized, well directed, mess of a film. The film manages to splash new life on the superhero genre, it fails in delivering the messages and metaphors that were spread about the graphic novel, from what I've heard and read of. There is many, many underlying ""plots"", if you will, that are only dimly focused upon. You'll easily catch wind of these, but will feel unsatisfied when the conclusion of the majority of the underlying aspects are either forgotten about or wrapped up terribly. It's the same equivalent of being told you're going to have sex and either have very unsatisfying foreplay or not getting anything at all.The acting is all over the place. Where some actors, such as Jackie Earle Haley, BIlly Crudup, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, and Patrick Wilson deliver powerful, touching, and deep performances, the remaining cast either portrays their character as one of a soup opera or of a first time acting job. It's completely obvious that Jackie Earle Haley steals the show away from everyone with his portrayal of the psychotic Rorschach. His tone, his expressions-- facial and bodily, give the character the tiniest but genius nudge in the right direction.The slow-motion trademark of director Zach Synder gets old almost directly after the opening credit montage. The effect works flawlessly in the opening scene of The Comedian's demise. It also gives the montage a very campy, but nice touch, making it stand out as one of the many highlights in the whole picture. After those two back-to-back scenes, the effect is used only to give the film a more stylish, modernized feel, which ultimately brings the film down...a lot. We've seen this song and dance numerous times, we don't need to see it again.The ""new"" ending works with the film in ways that the original couldn't. It adds more emotion and character to the characters involved in it. The message is put across ten times better than it would had the original ending stayed. I've read constantly that this ending is the biggest flaw in many people's eyes, which I can't understand. Using the original ending in this film would just make the campiness of the film go overboard.Also, the pacing at times is perfect, while at other times, the editor needed to be addressed more than they were.Overall, Watchmen has many flaws throughout it, but also has enough to hold it high up as one of the best films of 2009 to date. It left a dirty taste in my mouth for a few hours upon viewing, but later settled in. While I enjoyed the movie for the most part, reading that this is the closest depiction of the graphic novel we'll ever get just makes me believe that it shouldn't have been made. There's so much room for improvement that it'll frustrate even the casual of viewers.Enter the theater with caution.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
I think its only good to a fan.,"So I got dragged along to see this with my friends at the midnight session viewing expecting an ordinary super hero movie, which it turned out to be nothing much. I'm not a fan of the novel nor did I even know what it was about till i got there.The movie seemed over stretched, had no real plot understanding till the last 30mins, jumped around from scene to scene too much, fights scenes were sub par, and so many useless scenes they could have cut, some pretty bad acting from Malin Akerman for a movie like this. I thought the music that went with the movie was also pretty awful and could have had a better music selection. The movie seemed to be over explained and left nothing the you imagination, it seemed like there was constant narrating through out the whole movie.Overall, not a movie for the ordinary person, if your not a fan of the novel then you probably won't like the movie.

Brilliant Movie,"I've never read the Watchmen comics, so I don't know how the movie compares... but the movie was excellent.

As for the reason the movie was made, the plot, it was well written and the actors did a great job. Great underlying message in the end too, and the movie has a punchline that would make Heath Ledger's Joker jealous.DO NOT TAKE THE KIDS TO GO SEE THIS, there are some very graphic sex scenes and extreme gore scenes. They don't dominate the movie, but they are a part of it.I'm not the kind of person who likes a movie just because it's ""gore drenched"" or because it's ""sexy"", or even ""action-packed"".

Not for everyone (but definitely for me),"'Watchmen' is based on one of the most popular DC graphic novels of the eighties and it's been kicking about in (film) production limbo practically ever since. Many people have even gone as far as to call it 'unfilmable.' Therefore, many of its die-hard fans were sceptical when Zack Snyder took on the job of bringing it to the big screen.The result: a faithful adaptation and - in my opinion - a good one. However, that doesn't mean that it hasn't attracted more than its fair share of criticism.For a start, you have the fans of the graphic novel. They claim it's still not as faithful as it could have been. Yes, there are a few changes here and there which may leap out at the faithful. My counter argument is that - yes - the source material was so filled with sub-plots and excessive narrative structures, that all of it was never going to make it to the big screen. What we're given is a story that - while being complicated - is also accessible to the masses (and therefore commercially more lucrative - hopefully) and easier to follow.Then you have the people who have never read the graphic novel. They may not like it because they may be expecting something else entirely. If you look at the promotional poster, you may think that you're going to watch an 'X-Men' type film, filled with lots of superheroes fighting it out with various weird and wonderful superpowers. Warning: Watchmen is NOTHING like X-Men.Watchmen is a multi-stranded narrative which is more of a conspiracy-thriller-who-dunnit than an action movie (there's only two real action sequences in the whole film). Yes, the film happens to be about superheroes, trying to decide whether there's an assassin killing off their numbers one by one, but only one of the superheroes actually has superpowers (the rest are just basically good fighters in masks).So, if you're expecting either an exact replica of the graphic novel, a straight out action movie, or something like X-Men, you will probably be sorely disappointed. However, if you're wanting to watch a violent, visually-stunning thriller which twists and twines while it introduces various damaged ex-heroes, give this a go. It's dark, moody and certainly different enough to be appreciated for not adhering to every superhero cliché around right now. This is nothing like the 'Marvel universe' which is currently so popular!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"""...the flawed masterpiece.""","Director's CutIf crime cinema has its own ""The Godfather"", then superhero/comics would have accomplished ""Watchmen"". ""Watchmen"" does not win a point on terms for cinematic quality as much, but the narrative depth that it offers is thoroughly similar. Alan Moore's Watchmen is a complex story, with complex characters, in troubled times. Set in the cold- war era, ""Watchmen"" undertakes a visual scope of the darkest universe, with whores and wronged politicians dwelling.'Watchmen' is a group of costumed vigilantes, working for a sole purpose – to eradicate crimes completely and attempts to make the world a 'better place'. They are Rorschach (Jackie Earle Harley), Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson), The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), Dr Manhattan (Billy Crudup), Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman) and Ozymandias (Matthew Goode). ""Watchmen"" is probably similar to the batman universe. The only contrast would mainly be that Watchmen's has six, but Batman has one.Mostly during the course of the story, ""Watchmen"" shows retired superheroes (except Rorschach). Those being crime-fighters are merely a past. It is a national law called 'The Keene Act', which is being released during that point of time which made any form of vigilantism illegal.The story begins with the murder of The Comedian. His comrade, Rorschach, was being made to be wary, and immediately warned other Watchmens that there might be a formidable enemy intending to annihilate the group. Rorschach understands that The Comedian is not an easy target, and he deems the murderer to be no less than 'extraordinary'. The story then moves forward with Rorschach, the only active vigilante, striving to unravel the mystery by disclosing the identity of the killer, and the reasons of it.Even if it abruptly charges with a mystery, ""Watchmen"" never stays in that direction. The film continuously digs deeper- into the implications from the murder, and also into the characters. ""Watchmen"" shows competence in character development. For instance, Dr Manhattan is flawed morally, despite being the only person who is gifted with superpowers. He betrays his lover, lacking care for people and blindly obeys orders from the President to interfere the Vietnam War and mercilessly murder people. Perhaps amidst enduring the unparalleled abilities which none other will have, he loses touch with humanity.Ozymandias is questionable. A villain, an anti-hero or actually a hero? He is responsible for the peace made between nations in the world, but consequently, millions are killed. Ozymandias setting up exploding energy reactors in major cities to eliminate conflicts completely, reminded me of the efforts made by the American to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki to bring an end to Word War 2, and ultimately to carry peace to the world. If the world never condemns USA, then I don't see the need to put Ozymandias down. What he does, is actually similar to what American had done during the Second World War –kill millions, to save billions.Roscharch is most loyal to a set of principles he clings on. A fixed devotee of vigilantism he is, although he is actually the least merciful of the six. The Comedian has his story to tell, Nite Owl is a naïve-nice guy preserver and Silk Spectre II, the only woman in the team, shows weaknesses and shares unwell ties with her comrades. ""Watchmen"" shows strength in showing that all the characters play pivotal parts to bring the story forward. None of the characters is wasted, and if one goes off, the adventure will never work.I could imagine seeing ""Watchmen"" on a big screen and experience wonders. The competent cinematography led by Larry Fong brought images of streets to awe. David Hayter and Alex Tse too should be credited for putting up a deep, well-written intricate screenplay for the screen. The performances are uniformly excellent, especially from Jackie Earle Harley and Jeffrey Dean Morgan.""Watchmen"" is not your ""The Avengers"", ""Captain America: The First Avenger"", or ""Thor"" or anything that Marvel had been releasing for the past few years. ""Watchmen"" is different. It is dark, brutal, complex and distinctly pictured human nature – us. Celebrities or 'heroes' are well supported or admired in front of cameras or media, but the dark sides of them are concealed, just like the six heroes in ""Watchmen"". If superheroes are real, they would just be like the 'Watchmen'.

Not terrible.,"First off I'm in the ""has read book, dreaded the movie"" category but after finally watching the ""watchmen"" I can honestly say it was not terrible. I wont get into nitpicking about things that were left out or changes from the original material but will simply leave it by saying it was a faithful adaptation of the source.That being said, Id like to put out there a few thoughts on the whole lead up to this film and the resistance in it being made. Those familiar with the history behind the potential of having this material made into a feature film know all to well the story of the original director who was tagged to make it's story. In a nutshell Terry Gilliam claimed that it was ""unfilmable"" except for maybe as a 10 part miniseries or something to that effect. In this I both agree and disagree. I believe it was Gilliam's feeling that something so rich and beautiful as the original graphic novel shouldn't be the victim of any sort of dumbing down or compromise. And that he was possibly afraid of the filmed material being tossed onto the bargain bin of film history. However I believe that the source could have been filmed given the right hands to craft it. Was Snyder the right man for the job? I don't know.. Nor do I think its a relevant point. Any director would have tried to place his/her spin on it.. as that is what directors do and get paid for. It was inevitable that the thing would have been shot as motion picture, Im pleased and satisfied that it was handled appropriately.The feeling of having the piece lose its vibrancy and pertinence is a sentiment that I believe all of the original fans share. It was never about not filming ""the watchmen"" but more about having it not relegated to share the same shelf space in the sci-fi section as battlefield earth. The result, made by Snyder and co. unfortunately will not be a part of film history but hopefully in my opinion simply a stepping stone into discovering the wonderful piece of art that is the graphic novel.It is faithful and yet lacking.. this missing element i hope will lead new people to the original source.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Not Your Average Superhero Movie!,"Watchmen is definitely not the your average superhero movie you would come to expect. Zach Snyder did a very good job on changing things up and pointing out the flaws in each superhero character. Also, this movie is so much more violent than most superhero films. This film does a good job on showing the gore, blood, and sex.This film is about a group of retired superheroes who reunite after a death of their own. Once reunited, they find a diabolical plan to destroy the world.The acting is really good. The people who stood out to me was Malin Akerman and Jeffrey Dean Morgan as ""The Comedian."" I thought he was the best character in the film.Overall, this is a visually-striking film that is a little bit long. But this film has great action scenes and great character development. Watchmen is not your ordinary Spider-Man or Batman. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Watcmen is impossible to film,"I'm a big fan of the graphic novel. At first I had a doubt that Watchmen won't turn up to be a great big screen adaptation. After I watched it, I thought it was pretty decent. There are 12 chapters in the novel. Each chapter gives a detailed exploration about each character and their parts in the bigger plot, as well as the point of views from other supporting characters.I know it would be very difficult to translate the complexity of the book into the film, but the film itself wasn't that bad. The storytelling way in the film was a bit messy because there were so many parts of the book that were cut from the film. Those parts actually held the connection between each sub-plot tighter. And of course there weren't an in depth approach to each of the character. Leaving their personalities to be floating on the screen.But it was still enjoyable to watch, with great special effect, fighting scenes, and definitely the soundtracks.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Has one defining moment,"The marketing for this movie was first rate. Unfortunately, the movie did not come anywhere near the hype (nothing new there). A movie can appear good in retrospect or after a few viewings, but this movie just keeps on amazing with its ability to get worse.The overly long boring movie offered nothing. The makers should have worked with the creator and discussed how to have moved it from the comic book to the screen and into the new century. They did not, and ended up with an extremely poor movie. For those that disagree with such sentiments, just look at the numbers.I hope in years to come they re-make this story but with the creator’s contribution. For now, I only recommend the closing credits. This is one time you want to turn up late for a movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Important, thrilling, atmospheric and extraordinary","This is a review on Zack Snyder's Director's Cut of Watchmen.So many things you can say about this but you wouldn't be able to fit it all in the one review. Adapted from Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' highly influential comic book of the same name, director Zack Snyder attempts to bring Watchmen to another medium: film. And what an outstanding film it is. Running just over 3 hours, the film will never bore. Your eyes will be glued to the screen.Containing just incredible performances from nearly every cast member, the standouts are Jackie Earle Haley as Rorshach and Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan. Jackie is pure method when it comes to acting and is instantly unrecognisable as the vigilante. The way he moves, his deep and intimidating voice, his very disturbing back story: everything is perfect. Probably the best casting choice since Naomi Watts in David Lynch's Mulholland Drive. Billy Crudup, despite being totally redone in amazing GG, is brilliant as Dr Manhattan. Crudup's hypnotic and enchanting voice is the only reason I love his performance. Every time he's on screen, his voice just enhances the viewing experience. I could listen to him all day.Snyder and his team have put a ton of effort into re-creating Moore's gritty vision of 1985 New York. The set design is sublime and gorgeous. But it's the films visual look that makes the film even more special. Snyder is known for his highly visual films and Watchmen is no different. Every scene is carefully and skillfully done to create a sense of atmosphere and a stunning look. Such scenes like Rorshach's back story and Dr Manhattan's back story and The Comedian's funeral come to mind.I remember one reviewer saying, about Watchmen, that Zack Snyder is ""the Stanley Kubrick of comic book adaptations"". I think I will agree with this. So many images stay with you long after viewing. Snyder's style is very much like Kubrick's. Incredible set design, lovely long takes and an atmosphere like no others. So don't expect a run-of-the-mill comic book film. This is serious science fiction and a complex yet interesting look at humanity and what makes us human.Watchmen is truly special. An intelligent look at heroes, a highly interesting study of humanity and life and a visually stunning film that is one of the very best of the decade. A masterpiece that will hopefully get recognised more in the future. It is important science fiction that should lie with Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey and Mamoru Oshii's 'Ghost In The Shell' as serious works of art to be studied. If not, humanity may fail.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Great adaptation,"If there is a problem with Watchmen it is that people unfamiliar with the original novel will expect a superhero story. Watchmen is almost an anti-superhero story and if you are expecting something similar to Superman, X-Men or Fantastic Four you will likely be both confused and disappointed. The whole idea of Watchmen is much too epic to get across in less than three hours.For starters, the ""superheroes"" do not have any superpowers, except for doctor Manhattan. Night Owl is wealthy from his inheritance so he can afford some nice toys like Batman, but apart from that the so called heroes are real human beings with flaws and sometimes questionable motives for putting on a costume at night and going out to beat up the ""bad guys"". Unlike regular cartoon heroes they do not all have full confidence in their own judgment and neither does anybody else, except for Rorschach making him the main driving force in the plot. Like a psychological dissection, they all have different aspects of a superhero character.It all takes place in a nightmarish version of the 20th century where right-wing politicians like Nixon can be elected for five consecutive terms, gangs roam the streets and the population is in a bad state of cold-war paranoia.Alan Moore has crafted a brilliantly complex plot featuring psychologically deep characters in a world that mirrors the darker parts of human nature. Both the Comedian and Rorschach understand just how dark that can be, but naturally only the Comedian sees the humour of it. Translating this depth to a feature film is almost impossible as has been predicted, however Zack Snyder has succeeded surprisingly well and has kept very close to the original storyline and graphical style.The acting is very good for the most part, Rorschach and Night Owl are acted with great respect for the characters in the novel and really come to life. I was slightly disappointed in Ozymandias, not because of the acting, but I believe the actor himself could have been better chosen since he does not have the physique or charisma of Ozymandias in the novel. Other than that it was impossible to develop the characters any better.The ending was the only major alteration but it does not alter the outcome much and was needed not to over complicate the climax.I will probably watch Watchmen again and enjoy it more with each viewing. It is not for those who want an action packed battle between good and evil because this if far from it, but if you enjoy depth and realism then it could be a very enjoyable two hours and forty minutes. It probably helps a lot to read the book first to get a better understanding of the Watchmen universe but it isn't necessary, although I would highly recommend it in any case!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Comic part was much better than the actual movie!!!!!!,"Set in an alternate universe circa 1985, the film's world is a highly unstable one where a nuclear war is imminent between America and Russia. Superheroes have long been made to hang up their tights thanks to the government-sponsored Keene Act, but that all changes with the death of The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a robust ex-hero commando whose mysterious free fall out a window perks the interest of one of the country's last remaining vigilantes, Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley). His investigation leads him to caution many of his other former costumed colleagues, including Dr. Manhattan, Night Owl (Patrick Wilson), Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), Sally Jupiter (Carla Gugino), and her daughter, The Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman). Heralded for bringing the world of superheroes into the literary world, Watchmen gave the super-powered mythos a real-life grounding that had been missing in mainstream comics to that point.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
The apex movie of dark superheroes,"I remember reading this graphic novel in high school, and was very excited about this movie. It did not disappoint.In a refreshing trend began by perhaps Peter Jackson and his Lord of the Rings movies, tributes to past work of authors is being treated to something rare - directors who do not compromise, who present the work as written, who if anything give vibrant life to the brilliant work already done by the author. This is Watchmen.If the author is too dark, too gritty, then so goes the movie. You are treated to dark alter-heroes who you are not sure if you love or hate. In the case of the Comedian, I love him and hate him all at the same time. You are treated to the dirty naughty sexy trashy world of the pubescent young boy's fantasy supergirl, a world I relish in and still insist on to this day, and you are entertained.If the author put in ridiculous costumes and far fetched pets and tepid homosexual unlovable anti-heroes, then so goes the movie. He kept everything, and I salute him.Watchmen is a dark mirror on your society, and the evil of super hero worship, and the fallacy of fighting crime with violence. It is an exploration of the lurid sexuality in comic book heroines, and the horror and futility of war. All of this is capped with a top shelf music score and special effects visuals that blow it out of the water.One of my favorite movies, a brilliant masterpiece of film that I treasure.Hello darkness my old friend, it's good to talk to you again...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Not as good as the TV show, but still a nice movie","Great casting choices for every character in this movie. As far as Snyder's works go, this is pretty good for a comic book adaptation, especially for someone of his track record (as of 2022).Watched this movie after I saw the TV show, so it's not quite as good as some other Live-Action Watchmen media, but definitely not a bad movie, even though the 2hr 43min runtime is absolutely unnecessary and should be cut down. The script seems to think it's self important in parting with a moral of The Comedian's death or something, but it's handled clumsily and one of the lowlights of the film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
awesome,"Zach Snyder was able to conquer the impossible- adapting the popular graphic novel into a major motion picture. Many actors have attempted but Snyder has proved to be the most successful. Even die-hard fans of the comic can appreciate the movie.Although Snyder had to omit sections of the novel due to time constraints, he was still able to adapt the comic in a concise manner. Most of the alterations Snyder made only allowed the graphic novel to translate appropriately to the big screen.The movie is packed with attention-keeping visuals and the soundtrack is AMAZING.A must see by all means.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Awesome,"I think the best praise I can give the Watchmen is that I came away feeling as though I'd watched something very different. Super hero movies were in a funk: Spidrman was played awfully safe, Batman has been turned into a stuffy bore, the less said about X-Men the better - the world needed The Watchmen! It has relevance and topicality, intelligence as well as action and the soundtrack kicks all ass. So why not a 10? Well although it is a very faithful adaptation, I think it could have been even more so and I'm greatly looking forward to the directors cut. I'd previously read about the sex scenes, and though I didn't find them to be completely unnecessary, they just didn't fit the tone and as such they do seem a little 'wrong'. Minor gripes aside, The Watchmen is all over fantastic!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A Falling Standard,"From the first view of Nixon's nose (frankly just insulting to the audience) to the end credits brought in by an attempt at a Bob Dylan cover (resulting in some of the worst sounds I've ever heard) I never bought into the film Zack Snyder has made.The ""visionary"" director brings us an alternate 1985 New York, a New York which looks and feels fake; the result is an immediate disconnect to the characters, which are in effect used as props in the movie. Snyder spends so much time with the look of the movie (the shots, special effects and slow motion) that everything else feels secondary, so much so that when the characters do speak it's jarring. The performances, although pretty good for the most part, are over-shadowed by the film's attempt to recreate the pages of the graphic novel exactly.Snyder's choices of music, among a very obnoxious sound mix , were misplaced. In the Vietnam sequence Snyder uses ""Ride of the Valkyries"" in order to illicit the feelings and emotions given to us by Apocalypse Now because he is seeming incapable of doing this himself.This is the downfall of the movie. In trying so hard to be the graphic novel it loses what it should be as a movie. Why try to copy something exactly as it is? The answer is lack of creativity, originality, and artistic prowess.This film will be talked about for decades, unfortunately because of vast leaps in the field of penis CGI physics and the most ridiculous sex scene of all time.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Very entertaining but not great,"I was lucky enough to view an early screening of the movie and when I sat down with my popcorn I was hyper as ever. The aspect of the movie that shocked me most, which was not advertised in the trailer is how many comedic scenes that are going to be present. This element did not damper the experience I had too much because most jokers were funny but I went in believing that this movie was going to be very dark (have not read the GN). This addition of comedy for me immediately takes it out of the legendary film categories.The film has brilliant action with gore that stands up to the likes of Saw! CGI present was also on par with what film goers are used too. The music from Tyler Bates certainly tries to recreate some of his brilliance from 300 in this film and when you recognise this while watching it reminds you that you don't have to take this piece of art so seriously but too enjoy that same brilliantly choreographed scenes and that standing up out of your seat shouting ""YAH, you just got owned!!"" feeling that you received from 300.The film did drag on a bit too long and the side affects of this are looking down at your watch every so often as well as reminiscing the adrenaline pumping fight sequences earlier in the movie.Overall I very much enjoyed the film which entertained me thoroughly and appreciated the beautifully created scenery present. I recommend you see this film in the Cinema the way it is meant to be seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Amazing!,"When I saw WATCHMEN I had a reaction that I sadly seldom have with films today. My mind raced with a single burning question - ""When can I see this again?"" I'd been hearing of Alan Moore's graphic novel for years. People would talk about it in reverential tones. When I'd confess that I had never read it they'd give me a piteous look and, with the passion of true believers, urge me to read it as soon as possible.Three years ago I did. When I finished I thought that, if anything, their praise simply wasn't lofty enough! This is a masterwork.I held me breath at the prospect of someone trying to catch that lightening in a bottle. The cinematic road is littered with the bones of worthless suitors who've taken on the name of great works but not the heart.Zack Snyder captured it completely. I have tried to describe it to others who haven't seen it. I'm frustrated at my lack of vocabulary in appraising this film. I keep using the word ""amazing"" over and over.

"Never compromise, Not even in the face of Armageddon!","So last year in 2008 after seeing the spectacular super-hero movies Iron Man and The Dark Knight you could only worry that the next super-hero movie, Watchmen, could live up to the expectations that the fanboys like me craved. So yeah i'm a watchmen fanboy. And its finally here on time after all the court debates. So Watchmen the movie is essentially like Watchmen the graphic novel but played out in motion. It's like Sin City in that it is the perfect adaption, all dialouge and scenes are pretty much intact or unchanged which is good. Zack Snyders reach doesn't exceed his grasp he knows what hes doing it and does it for the fans. He knew whether or not to change certain things or expand on them. The cast was something of a mystery. When the first photos of the characters were released i looked rather bewildered. The only really recognisable name in the credits was Jeffery Dean Morgan. But the cast choices (like all comic book adaptions) were very spot on. Matthew Goode was okay as ozymandias and Nite Owl was okay too. Malin Akerman, aside from her obvious good looks, was pretty good and could handle her role well enough. But special acting merit really go to Jeffery Dean Morgan, Jackie Earl Haley and Billy Crudup. Rorscach is my favourite character from the book and you cant help but worry that an actor might screw up your favourite character (ryan reynolds if you screw up deadpool i will kill you) but Jackie Earl portrayed rorscach the way the fans know him. Jeffery Dean Morgan as the comedian was an excellent choice, he really captured the craziness and instability of the character.And Billy Crudup as Dr.Manhatten. Dr.Manhatten is an odd character, he is never actually with the humans he sees outside the human realm of existence in a sense. And Crudup managed to capture the characters sense of ""out of the box"". The book was never action packed. But the trailers kind of made the film out to be. How disappointed the lesser minds would have been. Zack Snyder, like i said before, knows what hes doing, he added in action scenes where necessary and didn't blow them completely out of proportion. And in watchmen the book the story and characters are just the bones of the greater fiction, the meat of the book is the themes and messages of humanity and vigilantism and how they affect us in modern society. These themes and messages remain unscathed. The one problem i had with the film was the changing of the ending. While the change wasn't amazingly drastic and kept in the same vein of the book it was still quite a departure. I don't see why they couldn't have kept the ending from the book anyway. At around 3 hours long it has good pacing and builds and creates its scenes well and doest waffle around with unimportant plot devices. So all in all this is a great movie for the fans but even my friend who hasn't read the book loved it so it may even appeal to some total wacthmen n00bs.

Awesome to not so awesome moments speckled throughout,"Overall good fun to see the pages of the comic book come to 'reel life'. Some sequences and visualizations were absolutely fabulous. Haley played Rorschach perfect, Veidt being played by Mathew Goode seemed a scary proposition but it turned out well. But, all this could have been much better. For starters couldn't Zack Synder invested more in the sound track/ original score section? Music throughout the movie seemed like Zack playing one of his mix tapes from the 70's 80's; the effect totally inappropriate pieces making potentially strong emotional scenes into cheesy and almost laughable segments. This showed a lot of immaturity on the directors part. Like Hendrix's ""All along the watch tower"" playing while Rorschach and Nite Owl approach Karnak.. .""Two riders are approaching. .. and the wind.."" come on, what was he thinking! Apart from Rorschach and the Comedian's roles, all others were forgettable performances. Still being in absolute awe and love of the source material, I enjoyed Zack's work!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Almost Perfect,"I have already shared some of my sulky after-movie rants here when I expected more from a comic book (or graphic novel) adaptation, and I thought while they are making films for profit they wont allow to lose megabucks in favor of some graphic violence. Never mind four letter words or sexually explicit scenes, which probably fall under more strict classification, maybe because they make a character more realistic (and Hollywood wouldn't want to be blamed for some kids getting mixed up between reality and the virtual universe), or more likely it's just the usual hypocrisy.And now we can see it in full blow: aged ex-heroine boozing at two in afternoon, a physicist turned into a god-like creature who starts to develop god-like aloofness towards mankind, and a violent macho symbolising America's usually concealed or denied fascism and superiority complex. Mind you these are some of the good guys we're talking about! There are some more good guys with a little more touch of the boy scout creed of an average superhero but they wont be caught feeling squeamish about shedding blood and wont say crap instead of f**k, either. (They even do it not just say it!)The cold war's atmosphere is captivating, but there's even more to it than the paranoid fear of a once highly potential nuclear holocaust. One of my favorite lines is when Adrian Veidt (Ozymandias) goes about solving the general problem of mankind. In brief, he puts it this way: we don't need to declare war on any nation or anything more than 'the evils that beset' men. And this thing is the artificially expensive energy (sources like fossil fuels and oil) that is being used for the only sake of maintaining the economy. This way of thinking wasn't new in the eighties but nobody gave it a f**k, and now it is still vastly ignored on high levels but this is the very reason I am really glad they cared to give it some place in the movie. For the usual moviegoer a bullet in between Lee Iacocca's eyes wont say much but it was my secret warm spot :)Apart from the deep thoughts there is what we can expect from a director like Snyder: beautifully choreographed fighting scenes every now and again. And not just in the third tier (as it's usually the case in this genre) but we're welcome with one great fight in the first few minutes. I felt ever so satisfied that there was only one character that could do harm by supernatural means, as the others had to perform some real exquisite stunts. This is what I call comic book on the screen, and Snyder proved that 300 wasn't just an accident.I don't want to spoil the story, but the endgame is a real treat too, without any of the usual Hollywood cheesiness or ignorant spoon-fed moral. Something to think about and at the time of writing I have to admit it is even more. It's a magnetism that I feel very rarely: I simply must see it again in the movies, as I can't wait for the DVD release. Let's hope it'll be a major blockbuster and also a critically acclaimed piece and so we can hope for a long awaited beginning of the adulthood of comic book adaptations. Keep up the good work Zack Snyder!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A good effort at making a difficult movie.,"The Watchmen film adaptation is both helped and hurt by its cool trailer and its source material. The trailer was amazing enough to encourage those with no previous knowledge of the graphic novel (like me) to check it out before the movie was released. Unfortunately, this only served to raise my expectations a bit higher than they would have been if I would have gone into the experience completely fresh.Taken for what it is, Watchmen is a laudable effort. While a few key scenes and important plot points ended up on the cutting room floor, that's more of a reflection of how well-written the source material is, rather than gaffs by Zack Snyder.The narrative and overall flow suffers the most from the necessity of having a reasonable running time. At times the movie just feels like it's a string of cool events that are taken directly from the comic frames, separated by a bastardization of the rest of the story. But then again, once I think of how complex the story is to begin with, it's easier to give credit to it being handled the way that it was.The acting was OK for the most part, by the end of the movie I had basically accepted everyone in their roles. Dr. Manhattan, Laurie and Dan took some adjusting too, while Rorschach, Adrian Veidt and Edward Blake were more of a natural fit. Some of the dialogue that works so well on the printed page seemed a bit clunky on the screen, but that's to be expected. Watchmen was written as a comic book, not a play.I think that open-minded newcomers who watch Watchmen stand a pretty decent chance of liking it. It works fairly well as a superhero movie, even without all its depth and complexity. Watchmen veterans, on the other hand, will just have to come to terms with the fact that while the movie wasn't perfect, it will be very difficult to make a better version of Watchmen. Perhaps we should enjoy what we have, changes and all, and just be grateful that this movie was even made. Don't expect perfection from the Watchmen film adaptation, that's what the graphic novel is for.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"""It is too late. Always has been. Always will be..""","This is one of those movies that are entirely attributed to one man. But it is the perfect example of how the involvement of a LOT of people can make something work.Thankfully, the original story is great! So it is quite hard to fumble an adaptation. Sadly, the reigns seem to be held by someone in control and with a vision.. one that probably shouldn't be in such a position. Specially when they are allowed to make some changes for ""no reason""! Some I understand, because of time and space. The fictional Marooned comic that ties into the story beats, for example. I'm one to think snyder doesn't understand very well what he is working with.. but one can't ever be sure.The visuals are impressive for such an adaptation. But you have entire departments of production and set design, as well as the visual effects, and cinematography.. not just a director.

Needed more Explanation,"Admittedly, I know nothing about Watchmen. Is it a comic book series, is it a graphic novel? Are they good guys, are they bad guys? Do they have superpowers do they not? This movie was my first introduction to them and it wasn't a good introduction. I was confused within the first five minutes. The character The Comedian (Jeffery Dean Morgan) was watching T.V. and he's watching a speech by Nixon at the president's podium, so immediately I'm thinking early 70's. Then he flips the channel to MTV which I know didn't hit the air until early 80's! But I thought: ""This will all be explained anyway."" Well, it wasn't.The movie then dove into giving us a taste of each costumed caper. There was a group called the Minutemen who, I think, were predecessors to the Watchmen (if the Watchmen is even a group to begin with). What I did gather is that these masked men and women were not quite who you'd want protecting your streets from evil. The Comedian, for instance, was nothing more than a criminal in a mask. And why even give him the name ""The Comedian""? That's entirely too close to ""The Joker"", another wicked DC character.Apparently, if you put on a costume you become super strong (like breaking concrete with your fist strong), you gain elite fighting skills, can dispatch of scores of foes without breaking a sweat, and can sustain the most gruesome beating without any visible signs of damage. OK, so you might be saying: ""Isn't that the case with all action movies nowadays?"" I say to that, yes, and I think it's absurd in all cases except when the action heroes have super powers.We all know it's a precondition for a female superhero to be a supermodel. One of the superheroes named Silk Spectre 2 ((Malin Ackerman) she was number 2 because her mom was the first), besides the super ability to maybe cause drooling with her incredible lack of clothing, she was able to kick men clear across a room, break bones completely in half and best of all she never had a hair out of place. Now that is an ability to be jealous of. No matter what she did: fight, have sex, save people from a burning building-- her hair was never out of place. Now, her clothes... that's a different story. They were displaced a few times as this movie bordered on softcore porn.Between Silk Spectre showing her goods and having a sex scene with Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson) and Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) choosing to parade around with no clothes, there was plenty of nudity. I guess if you get atomized and reconstructed like Dr. Manhattan did you then prefer to let it all hang out. Why wear clothes when you're ripped like Mr. Universe and you can presumably make your body parts any size you like?Let me not make it seem as though the movie was all bad. The last ten minutes were good. Which kind of sucks because the movie was so long. Two hours and 40 minutes or so to be exact.So, lets do a brief recap: confusing, softcore porn, unexplained abilities, too long. This movie wasn't catered to the non-fanboys at all.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

A fan written review,"After reading the comic book shortly after the film was announced, I deliberated about writing a review this soon as I would have liked to have seen it a second time. Like the many reviewers of this title; I have read the comic book, and I promised myself before watching the movie that I would try to not compare the comic and film too much whilst watching it, so I watch whilst appreciating Snyders creativeness with the characters and filming. I could compare the two versions after.The movie had received a lot of negative press in the months running up to the release, one which I was upset to hear was that the film was to be an adaptation.Overall the movie was what I expected; a lot had been cut out, and many scenes shortened and squashed together to shorten the film down to appease a wider audience. It would be hard to write my comments further about how the novel differs the film, as it would spoil the film immensely.The first scene opened the film perfectly, with the intro credits providing a brief history of the Minutemen and the foundations of Watchmen. I was sceptic about Snyder's trade mark slow motion effects being added in, especially as this was one of the only things that I didn't enjoy too much in '300'. However, I was pleasantly surprised to see these added to 'Watchmen' nicely.Haley was outstanding in this film, I hadn't seen him in any other films until now, although I've been told his performance in 'Little Children' was very good. I think the majority of the audience will find Rorshach the most likable character from the line-up. The casting was perfect, the awkwardness of Dan Driedberg was perfect, and Dr Manhattan's detachment from human civilisation was played out perfectly, in particular; the watchmaker scene.Although a great film, I feel as though more could have been added to describe the history of the Minutemen a lot more, as I think a lot of people would come out wanting more. I would highly recommend reading the comic, or even reading the 'Under the hood' sections.I am eagerly awaiting the directors cut, in the meantime I will just have to settle with watching it again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Laughing at the Comedian,"Its getting a bit difficult to choose between making one long movie, splitting material between two or three films, or just doing a TV serial.Watchmen mainly survives being packaged in one bundle. But the characters, the politics, the sexual politics and the plot begin to burst out of the seams. We are laughing when we should be in awe, and sometimes not laughing at the ironic humour.The acting was good in parts - but slightly too many characters remained 2 dimensional. Because a film can only really work at one speed and level at a time, we are occasionally presented with stuff that doesn't scan.But overall the film is entertaining throughout, and will challenge quite a few directors to risk more in what they deliver. But sometimes the format cannot frame the material.And who would have expected DC to be doing so well in the film franchise war?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A Critic's Perspective,"Watchmen.....With an opening scene, being a cross between Blade runner, for the grit and instant realisation that the future or in this case, the past, is not the wonderful utopia we all dream for, and Matrix time delay, to intensify the action and drama of our reluctant hero being beaten to death, you hope that more is to come. SighAs expected the grit and the filth of this scene continues, along with 1hr of flash backs, and character building that becomes boring and elongated even for those who aren't aware of the characters before hand.Being bored with this, your eye start looking for other entertainment, and you quickly notices, the similarities between ""league of extraordinary men, eye candy"" and the wide detailed landscape that becomes more interesting that the character that your meant to be watching.Just as you start to realise that the plot hasn't really developed in too what you would consider worth buying the extra large popcorn for. A love story comes to light, only to be stop, due to lack of medical advances that we are now privity to in too day society.With a couple of anti-climatic events before and after this one, I was left wondering what the whole fuss was about.Was it because the acting was little under done, or the characters didn't really have much to do until the end of the movie?Superhero movie?, No, but a movie that exercises it's political agenda via the interactions of 5 heavy weights that have been force to realise that they don't in fact have super powers, longing for ""the old"" days.With some great real life, sets, and time relevant hardware, expect for the graphic display of the T.V in the opening scene. Watchmen lacks for me the intensity of the comic, and the desire to back the bad guy, which came through more in the graphic novel, that could have ever hope for in a movie.Many of the fight scenes are put in place to prove not only to the retired characters but to the audience that they in fact as good as they think they are, but only to a point of dealing with real life situations. As the movie comes to an end, you realise, what should been totally obvious from the beginning that there are only two superhero's in the movie. A reluctant hero, and the megalomaniac villain backed by his own self worth of righteous.This movie delivers everything it sets out to do, with enough entertainment and eye candy to stave off the boredom, for two and half hours of getting to know normal people, coming to grips of how bad our human race has become.I grew up with these people in my life, they became everything to me. Superheros did everything I long to grow up and dreamt of achieving. Maybe with age you realise that superhero's don't really exist, only ordinary people wishing they could create world peace. In this case, these people do, but with sudden realisation, that ""Be carefully what you wish for, because one day you might get it"" and it may not be in the way you had dreamt.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
no superhero here-,"I've been using IMDb as a reference on movies for a long time now, and Watchmen is by far the most interesting movie- people either give 0-2 stars or 8-10stars- i don't see a 5,6-ish score in like 10 pages.just to express my gratitude to the society, i'm writing my first comment ever. there are lots of good comments written- along with the bad ones. i'll try to be brief and helpful, to those who aren't sure what to expect-this is Not a superhero movie- even if the marketing guys decided to make it look that way.

The thing is simple and the movie isn't it. I want to say that it should have been enough to end the film before the 2 hours and a half of duration.

Awful,"I feel that this movie was just awful. The acting was horrendous and the story was bland. The action was minimal compared to the amount of stupid drama. Rorscach was the only bright spot in this film, his character was the only one that kept me interested. It just continually proved to me that Marvel will always outfilm DC, its a fact. The awkward sex scenes are unnecessary and even the music in the film was corny. I would say that this movie lacked something but that would be an understatement, this movie lacked mostly everything. It was painful to watch and the fact that it was almost a 3 hour movie mad it 10 times worse.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

A great movie and also a great conversion from the comic to the big screen.VERY IMPORTANT: Everyone who expects a movie like X-Men or IRON MAN will be disappointed.

Core originality,"Simply said. I can find nothing about watchmen to bitch about. It took me through a world view and left me wanting more.The parallel world of watchmen where Nixon is a defacto Hitler.. is right out of fallout3 game and we all need a mod cons bunker. If you have no imagination or desire to know history. don't watch this.In its way a revelation. I am asked to produce 10 lines of text.. so i will expand. The movie does not need 10 lines . Like 'To Kill a Mockingbird'.It is a work of art as a whole. A story worth telling. So few movies like this exist.We argue to and fro about aspects of this or that film. But movies like watchmen, Mockingbird, Phenomenon, are art.""I am not locked in here with you, you are locked in here with me""Now THAT will become a catch aphorism for all the wannabee heroes. Rorschach became real to me with that line. His vigilante stance is now backed by raw power even if his stance leads to destruction he has earned it in willingness to fight any odds.

Soul of a Superhero,"Being a Superhero can be fun but the undeniable truth they all know is that their all human behind the mask. Sure I wouldn't mind being a Superhero but I can't do it 24.7 and it's not something I would want to do everyday or even forever for that matter if it interferes with my personal life too much. ""Watchmen"" is my second favorite graphic novel and I'm proud to say it's one of my favorite comic book movie adaptations and one of my personal favorite movies.Watchmen was never really a superhero epic but more of a character drama which was what made it great, and it was always the humanity of a superhero that I was always interested in the most. We get to know who each of the individuals behind the masks are they all have wants, needs, flaws, fears, feelings and can age which makes them human. The Wam Bam aspect came secondary which was fine by me since sometimes but it's nature it was story filler that can bring the character drama and development to a grinding halt which annoys me in some comics. There is a who dunnit plot that intriguingly develops but the story was never entirely concerned about it.Everything in this film is great and done right, from the setting they are able to successfully create the alternate America from the book which spans from 1960, 70, and 80. From the technologies which are in between modern and futuristic, what they watched, music, but also the costumes the superheroes wear. The fight sequences are great, the choreography is well done and their pretty violent; along with the special effects. It's true the film is long but the length was just right and I really didn't notice since this is one of those films your highly engrossed in that you don't care.There are a lot of great characters that are all three dimensional and told in a non linear and multi focus format (similar to the TV show ""Lost"" and movie ""Pulp Fiction"").Walter Kovacs/Rorshach (Jackie Earle Haley)he's my favorite character in the book and the actor not just looked like him but nailed the persona perfectly. He's sort of a more accessible Batman like character, highly intelligent, enigmatic, spooky, and might have a bit of a screw loose due to his strict black and white ethical belief that everything is arbitrary and has a pattern which probably only exists in his mind. That mask of his is one of the most impressive one's I've seen (how the heck he can see and breath in it is anyone's guess) because it's an ink blot test pattern that constantly changes. Trust me, he may'be a small guy and doesn't look like much but if any bad guy tries to pick on him he'll make them into dog meat. For example, while in prison one big guy goes at him with a knife, Rorshach just hits him with a food tray and throws deep fry grease onto him, ouch.Jon Osterman/Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) he is the most complicated of them all because he's the only one that really has superpowers. It almost seems he has the good deal but sometimes with some superheroes all great power has a price. From him it was simply his human identity and mortality. His abilities have literally given him a sort of godhood, he can see multiple possibilities before they happen and has immortality. These things have made him detached from human kind to the point where his former human identity has became a distant untouchable memory. In a way his longing for mortality again is similar to Greek Myth how Gods would watch over mortals but then become mortal themselves once in a while just to get a taste what they don't/can't have or be.Dan/Night Owl 2 (Patrick Wilson) is another Batman like hero from his inventiveness and all the gadgets in his underground lair. He's laid back and can live a normal life. But deep down once in a while we see he yearns to play his superhero role again because he feels his work is far from done. It sort of reflects the repressed feelings he has carried for Laurie Jupiter/Silk Spectre 2 (Malin Akerman) for a long time.Silk Spectre 2 is a sweet, strong, slightly feisty female superhero but is a little troubled herself in figuring out who she really is and what she wants of both her identity and life.Edward Blake/Comedian (Jeffery Dean Morgan) is an anti hero that you can like or dislike (I'm more leaning toward dislike) at the same time, he is a person that has done some shady things in both personal and professional life, but we see he's a broken person from his eyes there's a sense of shame and regret.Adrian Veidt/Ozymadias (Matthew Goode) is the smartest man in the world, idealistic and has literally unbeatable martial arts skills but he's a shady enigmatic characters; he's a bit cold and might have developed a bit of a god complex which makes him a bit chilling.The film shows a superhero is always human, it doesn't matter what unique abilities he/she has there will always be limitations. Sure ""Spiderman"" can shoot webs and swing from point A to B, but he can't fly nor get to somebody in trouble 100 miles away. And he has to go back home and take off his mask to deal with his personal life. Even Superman after a hard day wants to go back to see Lois Lane. There is a conflicting dichotomy as we see humans wanting to be superheroes and stay super for their human lives are limiting and equally despise the role because it keeps them from being human and live life as themselves.Superheroes behind the masks are made of flesh, blood and possess human souls.Rating: 4 stars",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Ultimately a boring and uneventful movie,"The first five minutes lays the foundation for an interesting plot which is not handled in any noticeable way for two hours. Things get increasingly frustrating with every flashback as the viewer is further educated on the history and motivations of all the characters. These techniques, which seem to make up more than half the movie stunt any forward momentum. The violence is over the top, unnecessarily gory. The music is some of the greatest music ever written: Dylan, Simon and Garfunkle, Leonard Cohen, etc. But it feels almost too mainstream, like it's '60's awareness time children, put down your Brittany Spears!'. Sure it's great but way too obvious. The fight scenes are typical Asian choreography, strings attached, nothing new here, the usual dancing. So, all in all, I was left feeling bored for most of the movie. There was some excellent and convincing acting in the Rorshack character, who is likable for his uncompromising views, his fearlessness, and his humour.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"For what it's worth, it's astonishing.","Prior to going to see this film last night, I was overlooking some critic reviews ans was rather surprised to hear their response. A good bit of them were panning the film calling it superfluous and plodding. Going into this picture, I knew I had to take some of these elements very lightly as this is based on a graphic novel with not a real sense of reality along with the 160 minute running time. Still, based solely as a piece of film making, which is how I viewed it without comparing it to its original material at all, I found it to be visually stunning as well as occupying a heart, something usually lacking in superhero flicks.To surmise the plot, the year is 1985 in an alternate universe where Richard Nixon is president for a fifth term, the US and Russia are on the brink of nuclear destruction, and superheroes are a part of everyday life and culture. Here, they have been around since the 1940s and continue to evolve and fit into the society that changes constantly. Now, one of their own as been viciously murdered and the most mysterious of the Watchmen, Rorschach is on his own manhunt to find the killer. He comes across his old pals including Nite Owl II, Silk Spectre II and Dr. Manhattan. Together again, they now must fight the world that will end without them, their own personal demons and each other amidst a nearing apocalypse.Again, going only on the film aspects, this does triumph in more ways than I think people are giving it credit for. Despite the running time, director Zack Snyder gives adequate insight to each superhero showing their past in flashback as well as what has led them to this point. This is wondrous to behold as we get to see a variety of people who have been called upon to save the world when they need saving from themselves or the situation they find themselves in. The acting is mostly great with Jackie Earl Hayley as Rorschach, the narrator, perfectly capturing his brutal manner and grisly voice. Patrick Wilson is also terrific as an overweight, mild-mannered geek Dan Dreiberg who once masqueraded as a superhero but now is reduced to working in his basement. Malin Akerman, I can't really say is that convincing as an actress but she does look good in tights. Perhaps the most sympathetic character is Jon Otterman, also known as Dr. Manhattan, a glowing blue superman who is almost like a demi-god in the fact that he isn't limited by time and space. Because of this, caused by and accident in the lab, he is also in his own world and unable to connect to really anyone outside of himself.I know why some people would really not like this film as the tone is incredibly grim and the plot is sometimes convoluted. Still, there is not doubt in the visual effects, which are ground-breaking and beautiful at the same time. As I said before, the acting is mostly great with some characters not cast for talent as much as for looks. Director Snyder handles this material, which I am told is unfilmable, with a deft hand and is mostly successful, save for a completely unnecessary sex scene in the middle set to the song ""Hallelujah."" Of course, no one else will complain about that, but despite that and several plot holes, Watchmen is astonishing and although it's much too early, is probably the best film of 2009. Enjoy it for what it is and understand the movies are headed in this direction. Change is coming to all of us, no matter what we do.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Who Watches The Watchmen?,"This is a good film, that could have been greater.Snyder is known to make faithful film adaptations of eclectic comics, but in this one, he falls a little short; he was lost in the details, and when that happens, you usually lose the bigger picture.It reflects on the rhythm of his movie; sometime it is so hashed-out it could have been edited by Uwe Boll. There are film noir excerpts, told in the first person by Rorschach and third-person viewpoints and flashbacks, which gives the film the feeling of too many hands at work.The aspect that distracted me most was the use of obvious musical scores without any relevance here and there in the movie. If I can accept Dylan's ""The Times They Are A Changing"" in the opening credits while past history is showcased, I had troubles with the same old, same old hippie classics like ""All Along The Watchtower"" and ""The Sound of Silence"" (the later one being played at the funerals of a guy for which few had any sympathy to this point), which had no relevance whatsoever in a film which takes place in the 80s, apart from being well-known hits that would make people in the viewing room go ""Hey! Cool!"" and ""Alright!"" when they hear it. The use of Apocalypse Now's Ride of the Valkyries during the Vietnam part was especially pathetic.Yet during other parts, like in Dr. Manhattan's story, the music (in this case, Phillip Glass') merged with what was on screen with complete osmosis, creating a little masterpiece that could have had a life of its own. You get a impression of godlike omni-potency, and yet also of hopeless solitude when experiencing it. The best part of the movie IMO, and the only one who measures up to 300's lavish style.The actors give acceptable performances, the best ones being delivered by Haley and Morgan in interpreting Rorschach and the Comedian, respectively. Gugino's tiny appearance lit up the screen as a very credible 40s pin-up, and Akerman was a treat for the eyes, although about any Hollywood starlet could have done as good given the thin character.The camera work is good, but is being hampered by Snyder's strict observance of the original novel's layouts; As much as it worked in 300, the passage here from paper to film is more debatable.Too much have been written about Dr. Manhattan's genitalia, a most hypocrite reaction when compared to the explicit violence and gore that pockmarks the film -and which is absent from the novel, BTW. Well, it's about as erotic as your average secondary school biology manual. Half of the inhabitants of the Earth's got a penis, people. Don't make such a fuss about it. Beside, we see much more of Akerman's zones than Dr. Manhattan's CGI ones, anyway (which isn't unpleasant).The history (which I won't recapitulate here) is, of course, of the first order, but suffers from the lack of rhythm that comes from the difference between the medias.In the end, Watchmen is a movie that will make its audience think, much more than 300; it isn't just a dumb summer flick filled with explosions, but a philosophical movie draped in capes and masks.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Watch me(n) care less.,"* Note: Yes, I read the graphic novel; no, I do not consider it perfection. This is not a biased Watchmen-comic fanboy review, nor a review from someone unappreciative of the original story.Adoptions and remakes are always severely patronized. When we view them, we always have an image of the original version laced in gold in the back of our heads, with the label of PERFECTION hanging over that image. When someone interprets that original version of a story into another field of art, or reinterprets it into the same field of art, we go in unconsciously thinking that there is NO WAY it will affect us as powerfully as the original did. This alone is stupid. If you look at past novel-to-film adoptions, a lot of them have far surpassed the original text. The biggest example is A Clockwork Orange. The original novel was just another cliché the-government-is-evil novel with a cute spin on morality tied into the ending. The film, however, nearly single-handedly created the surrealist genre in cinema and minimized a lot of the cliché plot points. Just because a movie is based on a novel does not mean it has to be bad. However, if there is a flaw in the reinterpretation, we say it's the loss of the translation, but we never stop and accuse the original version of that flaw, even if that's where the flaw originated. Viola, Watchmen.If there is anything the film version of Watchmen does, it shows the gaping flaws in the original graphic novel. Zack Snyder is taking a lot of critical trashingsome of which he deservesfrom the group of people who saw their nostalgic childhood memories/fantasies torn apart on the movie screen. But what that group of people fail to realize is that Snyder didn't change . . . well, anything at all, except the ending. He left out trivial scenes and bits of dialogue for the sake of time, but he pretty much copy/pasted everything in the graphic novel to the screen. That's something that can be proved on close examination of the two works. So there are only two reasons for people to dislike this movie: the actual story from the graphic novel, and the modern visual presentation.As I stated earlier, a lot of negative reviews from the fanboys are (correctly) trashing their beloved graphic novel without even realizing it. The biggest problem that is obvious in both the film and novel is that the underline story of the Watchmen is just seen-this-before. The graphic novel wasn't unoriginal in the sense than you could predict every plot point, but it was unoriginal in the sense that when you look back, you see how typical the grand picture is. In both movie and novel, the ending is the cheesy and predicable reversal-of-expectations that has been done for hundreds of years. It's something you expect from a 5th grade creative writing session, not something from a said-to-be literary genius like Alan Moore. A lot of other plot points were directly ripped-off of Twilight Zone and Outer Limits episodes. Even the so-called ""deep"" themes are just clichés. You've heard them all before in high school psychology class. We understand the world is a bad place. We've understood it when we were 4-years-old and our grandmothers got ran over by a semi. Yet Moore carries his writing as if he's saying something completely new. Furthermore, the graphic novel and movie both reek of blatant immaturity. 1000-foot blue penises. Some of the most laughable costume choices ever drawn. The immature idea that something has to be laced with violence and sex or it isn't a mature piece of art. All the movie did was bring these flaws to the screen and expose them. These aren't Snyder's flaws, these are Moore's.Now for Snyder. First and foremost, Watchmen should have never been entrusted to him. Period. Watchmen should have been treated like The Godfather. Instead, it got the treatment of the Spider-Man 3 outtakes. As a visionary director, Snyder is perfect when he's working on movies like 300. He has an infinite amount of talent with brining style and freshness to generic action scenes that you've literally seen thousands of times. This is why 300 worked so well. 300 was a pointless action movie, and it never tried to be anything else. Watchmen is the equal opposite. The heavy themes or nihilism and pessimism are almost made laughable in the film version of Watchmen. It's as if Snyder couldn't decide if he wanted to be a pretentious old man or a crowd-pleasing hack. And he isn't experienced enough or talented enough to attempt both at the same time. Also, his overuse of CGI literally turns entire portions of the film into a bad Disney Channel cartoon. This is partly due to Moore's immaturity, but Snyder's CGI just emphasizes it to the point I felt like I was watching Horton Hears a Who more than once.As for the level of violence and sex: both were mild. The reason I mention it is because so many reviews are complaining about generic gore scenes, or a single breast shot, which I find downright funny. The average T-rated (13+) video game has more blood/violence than Watchmen^4. I can name several PG-rated films with more nudity. Grow up, folks.Every factor I just listed is why Watchmen fails as a movie, and is underwhelming as a novel. The movie does absolutely nothing but rip open the mild bleeding wounds the novel had. It dumbs down an already semi-unoriginal story. It takes the boring dialogue scenes in the novel and turns them tedious and impossible-to-sit-through. It takes the downplayed childish elements in the novel and parades them in front of the camera. It turns the stylish art direction of the novel into a cheap live-action cartoon.The Watchmen underwhelmed me in the first place. Now I just sit and laugh at them. Again: Grow up, folks.2/10",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Stunning,"The reviews have been mixed, and therefore it was with some trepidation that I went to see this. Despite being a lifelong comic book fan and having read the original book back in 1986. Oh wow! As good as if not better than Blade Runner. This film will run on forever just like that one. Everyone was excellent. Especially Rorschach. If there is no Oscar for Jack Earle Haley playing him, there is no justice at all. Malin Ackerman too. Awesome. Not 'eye candy' like some clowns have said. Her character is the central role in the story, so she had to be more than that. She played it brilliantly. Also extremely well acted was Patrick Wilson's take on Night Owl. A middle aged man with problems some fifteen years older than the actor himself. Now that is good!90% faithful to the book which seems impossible, but true.I loved it all except the guy playing Nixon's rubber nose which was a tad silly.The only thing could really fault was the horrendous Bob Dylan cover by My Chemical Romance played at the end. I agree with other posters that this was out of context and in the wrong film. Not only that, but it is probably the worst track they have ever made. It sounded like it was made in one afternoon's jam session - it was crap! Why put this this incongruous awful music on the end ? Was it done to make the goths go to the cinema to boost takings ?

See it in IMAX...,"I never heard of the ""Watchmen"" before seeing the movie trailer. In fact, after seeing it, I thought that this would be like more like the Fantastic 4 (which wasn't one of my favorite movies) than Dark Knight.However, the critics and user ratings are right - this is an amazing movie - if you see it in IMAX. This is how I saw it. I seem to have had a very different experience than many of my friends who saw it on normal sized screens. The IMAX rendition is so striking (both visually and audibly) that any problems in storytelling are shunted into the background. As such, I strongly recommend making the effort to see it on the huge screen if you have that option.That said, it was well-acted, visually stunning and the pop-art references are fantastic. It is 2hours and 40 minutes long - and, in huge screen mode, just about every darn minute there was something amazing to look at.It's basically a mystery story about the death of superhero ... in 1985. Although in this version of 1985, the existence of superheros is a part of life (even though there are only a handful).Whatever you 'think' a superhero or comic-book movie can be like, this movie will challenge that (like Sin City did). It's not a kid's movie by any means. There is intense and graphic violence, explicit nudity and adult themes throughout. My advice is a big thumbs up if you've got an IMAX theater showing it. Since the critics and user ratings for this movie are both in positive territory, I say that indicates it's good flick no matter the screen size.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Worth The Wait,"I've never been a big comic book reader but always enjoy superhero movies regardless of whether I'm familiar with the superhero or not. As technology improves and advances, so has the story lines surrounding the lives of the superhero. Overall, this movie did not disappoint me. There could have been more crime fighting than explaining the history of crime fighting. I didn't think the movie was for kids obviously as the MPAA didn't think so either by the R rating. If you've seen the movie Sin City, then you should have an idea of the types of scenes that could be shown in this movie and trust me, there was no deviation from that style.I have a thing for slow motion scenes in movies and think that was the greatest discovery since sliced bread. There were plenty of slow motion scenes that captured the action the way I love to see it. I know there are just as many ""thumbs down"" as there are ""thumbs up"" which part of the problem, from what I understand, is related to the connection of the movie to the comic book. As I mentioned earlier, I'm not a big comic book fan and therefore cannot relate the movie back to that source. I only had to rely on the storyline to entertain me and I was truly entertained. As I'm sure you are aware, the movie is very, very long and some parts where it gets into the history of some of the crime fighters can be a bit challenging if you haven't had your Wheaties. That doesn't take away from the movie; it just means that you have to pay attention to what's being said so that you can understand the psyche of some of the characters.I didn't want to give any parts of the movie away so I kept it brief. I think this movie is worth the almost 3 hours of downtime it takes. I'm sure you'll be entertained to some degree.

Awesome!!!,"Thanks for making this movie I have been waiting many years for this and it will definitely go down as my favorite movie of all time.I'm a big fan of the comic and didn't know what to expect from the movie, the comic is so complex and long I didn't think it could be done, but it has and it totally blew me away. The visuals/cast/acting/music were all spot on.I know they changed a few things and some left out even things I wanted to be there but the end product was just amazing.I'll definitely be seeing this a few times and I can't wait for the DVD director's cut :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Who watches the Watchmen? Me. And I'll do it again.,"Whatever your views on whether or not this film ever should of been made, the beauty of the finished article is something that can not be denied. Though Alan Moore will never acknowledge the project, what Snyder has produced is a tribute to Moore's imagination and a near perfect homage to his work. Though there are some changes, other bits missing and the occasional bit of artistic license used, the movie is about as faithful a translation of the novel as one could realistically wish for. It looks sublime, the action is incredible and the general atmosphere absorbing. I loved the novel and loved the film, proof that the two needn't be mutually exclusive.Despite it lasting nearly three hours, perhaps the biggest compliment I can give this film is that upon leaving the cinema, both my girlfriend and I looked at one another and said ""We need to go see that again - very soon!""A wonderful achievement and a fantastic film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Enjoyable but definitely not the best,"I watched the movie last night and left theater wondering if i would watch this movie again. The beginning of the movie (especially the opening credits), the cemetery scene the killing scene of the comedian and the music choices truly delighted me and made me think the following would be one of the best adaptions of graphic novels in movies after Sin City.However the movie started disappointing after the first hour, the story (not sure whose fault it was) seemed sort of ridiculous and not very entertaining and captive. The movie seemed to mock itself Then was the whole sequence in the prison, Rorschach psych exam, the attempts of his murder by other convicts and the series of the shots of the bathroom door with flashes of Rorschach advancing to kill were GREAT. But then the movie relapsed in more ridiculous ""emotional"" performances and dragged on for another hour.Overall the movie is not up to the level of the 300, but some moments were done with great direction daring choices and beautiful photography but the majority of the movie made me think that they didn't have and definite vision of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Now, Everyone's Watching...","Seeing Watchmen has sold out tickets, has had long lines and has already received several reviews on websites, the film appears nothing short of a success. While I do agree that the ending does bog down a tad with its over-dialogue--all the while confusing novel readers alike--the comic book labeled ""unfilmable"" has been completed to near perfection.For lack of naming actors, the performances of Rorschache and Nite Owl were arguably the best, while critically-bashed Silk Spector II and Ozymandias were much better than given credit for. I thought Silk was the center of the film's sense of humor (as well as the sex, obviously) and Ozymandias was not given the proper back story to build up his character: the Alexander The Great-influence; his family's wealth; how did he become this ultimate ideal of such strength and intelligence? And so sure, he doesn't look like Robert Redford, either. Oh well.Watchmen excels with a great opening credit sequence (one of the best ever), beautiful set design and costume (they nailed it), cool tunes (other than an unneeded Tears For Fears instrumental) and outstanding cinematography (didn't rely on lame camera tricks). Director Zach Snyder's use of CGI within the film was especially great, none better than that of Jon Osterman a.k.a. Dr. Manhattan. It's true, if you haven't read the book, you're not going to be nearly as amazed with how superb Snyder captures Jon's presence and dialogue within the movie. Film critics have also claimed that the Mars' sequences look cheesy. Are you kidding me? It was beautiful. The working gears of Jon's new home nailed the reference to the outer realms of time and space. Maybe the newspapers were cutting the budget, not allowing critics the IMAX treatment. Really, Watchmen has some of the best CGI ever put to film.The fight and action scenes (i.e. the opening death, the alley fight with Dan & Laurie, the prison break sequence) were excellent. They did include Snyder's signature slow-motion, extreme gore, and sheer violence (ala 300) without making it a farce. The black humor and sensitivity of the novel (i.e. Comedian's breakdown, Rorchache acknowledging friendship) gave new fans that much needed balance. Being a hardcore graphic novel and comic book geek, it was even easier to understand more of the Watchmen's analogies, themes and messages from seeing it in live action. That's a plus.It wasn't hard to receive goose bumps and anxiety from watching the Watchmen. If only those feelings remained towards the end of the film (it's a little different, yes, but the overall meaning is still there), I would say Snyder's adaptation of the Watchmen is perfect. There's no fault in being ""too faithful to the book."" There is a fault, however, for not giving this outstanding achievement in cinema a few hours of your time.****",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Cant get much closer to the book,"Since I read the book first its hard not to review the movie without comparing it to how close it was to the original. So I'm not sure how I would review it had I never read it. The book did not blow me away when I read it, but I thought the murder-mystery story was interesting and had some cool characters and an original spin on the lives of comic book heroes. Just seeing things like the comedians death, owl ship and Dr. Manhattan brought to life almost exactly like the book was pretty amazing. I am glad they went with unknown actors so audiences do not focus on what star is in the role and take away from the believability of the characters. For the most part the actors were convincing, especially Rorschach, with the voice and visual effects ended up being way cooler than what I would have thought. The films visual effects were top notch which made me wonder why they didn't spend as much time on the horrible Nixon makeup. Aside from the Minutemen, the costumes were made to look a little more modern and I believe the change was good, since the original designs were a little ridiculous looking even for the time period. As for the music, I personally am not a fan of folksy protest songs that made up a large part of the soundtrack, but I guess they were appropriate for the mood the director wanted to set for what was going on at the time. I also feel the movie should have been NC 17 with a lot of unnecessary nudity and very brutal violence which was in the book, but not to that extent. To me the ending explanation was more believable than the space squid, which just would have been silly looking after going through this serious story line for 2.5 hrs. The director said he wanted to make this movie before someone ruined it and by pretty much copying the look & dialog of the book word for word this really cant get any closer.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Makes you want to watch silent films again.,"First of, I read watchmen the week before I saw it. It was damn near perfect. The ending is... indescribably perfect. So with great expectations, I sat down in the cinema to see what Mr. Znyder could deliver, or if he could deliver.He did. Mostly. The film starts off excellently with the killing of the comedian(played to perfection by Jeffery Dean Morgan), and is a superbly shot scene. Then, as the opening title appears, Bob Dylan is played. Yes, that is right. The opening title itself is a terrific, funny, helpfull and cool. But for god's sake, a man was just thrown out the window, Bob Dylan is not appropriate!The film continues, Roarshach is introduced & played perfectly, and the plot evolves. Just a wee bit slow. We get introduced to all the characters, most of whom play their part excellently. The only one I didn't quite like was Ozymandis.As the film progresses it look gorgeous, and contains all the key scenes and quotable comments. But also dreadful music. The most obvious scene that springs to mind is sex scene with Nite Owl & Silk Spectre, with a horrid verison of Hallelujah in the background.As a conclusion, the movie looks and feels like true Watchmen. They DID manage to film it. But, despite the promising music in the trailer, it chose poor music at vital moments, making it feel a bit campy.Yet, Watchmen is worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Should have been better,"When i heard they were turning one of my favorite comic books into a movie i couldn't wait to see it, but after watching it i wish i never went to see it. The opening credits were amazing and by far the best part of this movie. Although Zack Snyder has a talent for great visual effects he cannot contribute anymore than that. The dialouge was taken straight out of the comic and came off really cheesy. Also this movie had horrible acting the good actors were Rorsharch and the comedian. And where was the original soundtrack if you are going to make an epic superhero movie you cant just pick some random songs from your ipod. And right when i was getting interested in the movie he throws in a 10 minute sex scene and i was ready to leave. Snyder makes a descent attempt at watchmen but it can definitely be better.

I saw many couple get up and leave long before I did. Second, the movie is confusing. They jump from one bizarre storyline to another. These filmmakers must have thought this movie and it's topic are so incredibly interesting that everyone else would think so to. Guess what - they're wrong. It's bizarre. The movie is also very violent and gory in many parts. In short, Watchmen deserves to crash and burn. Be careful about all these positive reviews.

Jack Earle Haley portrays a scary Rorschach, Jeffrey dean Morgan is perfect as The Comedian.

The Mythology is Translated with Elegant Perfection,"Notorious for its 24 year, serpentine path to the big screen, Watchmen has finally, and definitively been realized as the astonishingly complex piece it was originally conceived as. There is elegance in the moral ambiguity of the source material, and it would have been a desecration to forgo this in order to bring yet another cardboard ""Comic Book"" film to the theaters (e.g. The Fantastic Four, The X-Men, last two Spiderman films, etc.). The Watchmen was never a comic book, but a deconstruction of the superhero mythology. Deconstruction is not just a fancy term for ""things are gonna explode"", movie patrons. Jerry Bruckheimer's name is not attached to this film. This is brilliance.With no shortage of thrills the action, like that in ""The Dark Knight"", has a point. It is reassuring that a director understands the difference between pyrotechnics and plot. The Blu- Ray Director's cut provides extra footage which enhances the story for the uninitiated.And for the record, Jackie Earle Haley defines the role of conflicted freak as only Heath Ledger had before.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I watch the Watchmen, and I love it.","Watching the Watchmen is a satisfying experience. I'm a fan of the comic, and this movie lived up to my lofty expectations completely.I love the visual style of the film, and the music choices suit the mood nicely. It's kind of reminiscent of what Scorsese does with music in his films. The highly stylized look of the film, the use of CGI, I dig it all. Right from the very impressive opening credits, the movie pulls me into its world with the visuals and music.The cast is great all around, they deliver the goods. Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl II, Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach, Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian, and Carla Gugino as Silk Spectre all resonate very strongly with me. Some folks have said that Malin Akerman's performance as Silk Spectre II is weak, I have no complaints personally.Pretty much every artistic liberty the movie takes is fine with me. The villain comes across as more creepy in the movie than in the comic, I do enjoy this interpretation of the character as well. The various other changes also went smoothly with me. I feel that they did a perfect job adapting a very dense work into movie form.The characters are as likable and flawed as ever, and the feel of paranoia and helplessness of the cold war is thick. The action is spectacular, brutal and satisfying. The tender moments are handled quite well also, giving us the full package of sex and violence.Pretty much, Watchmen is a modern fable about vigilante heroes trying to fight the feeling of powerlessness during the Cold War. It's an uncompromising ride I plan to take many more times over the years.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"'Watchmen' is a movie that leaves you, ""WOW!""","""Watchmen"" is the first movie of 2009 that will leave you at awe. It's visually stunning, well acted all around, terrific direction by Zack Snyder, and overall pleasing to see & experience. Now, for the geek critique stuff. Yes, there's NO squid ending, but this new ending works in more ways than you could possibly imagine. It truly is an incredible ending, and frankly I wish Alan Moore thought of it. It ties everything together about human nature and why we're a race that wants nothing more than control. Also, there is no murder of Hollis Mason, but from what I read it will appear in the Directors Cut. No, Black Freighter, saw that coming when the movie was being made, lucky for us, it comes out on DVD in a couple of weeks and will intertwine in the ""Ultimate Directors Cut"". I guess the 2 little things that erk'd me were the following, the old age make up (wasn't too convincing) and second, Matthew Goode as Ozzy. He just came off too much like a douche.

Sure, there were changes for a more modern age, but it was still done in comic-style...and you could really tell.

Simply Brilliant,"First up, an acknowledgment. I've never read the graphic novel. So my review is entirely based on the movie. Short version, 10/10, and simply brilliant.For a starters, this movie --is not kid friendly--. This is a story for the adults, and it is well worth it. I've taken my nephew to see Ironman, The Incredible Hulk etc, this is not a movie in the same league, not even really in the same genre.To describe the movie's plot, I feel, is to subtract from the whole. There are many things going on at once, and when talking to a friend I described it as ""Pulp Fiction"" in a comic book universe. On reflection, this really seems to me an accurate description. Whilst there are some 'comic book' moments of action and fighting etc, this movie is all about the story. There are a handful of stories going on at the same time and, honestly, each and every one was great.Do not be fooled by the 'comic book' nature of the movie. The story line is one of the greatest I have seen in a while, where, at the end of the movie, I left wondering which 'side' I would choose. There is virtually no 'good guys and bad guys' situation, each character is a 3 dimensional person with flaws, good points, and bad.Will be seeing again two or three times.

The best superhero movie that I've seen in years,"WATCHMEN is a 2009 American neo-noir superhero film directed by Zack Snyder and it stars a supporting cast of Malin Akerman, Patrick Wilson, Billy Crudup, Matthew Goode, Jackie Earle Haley and Jeffrey Dean Morgan and also Carla Guigino is in the film as well.It is an adaptation of the 1986 - 1987 DC Comics limited series of the same name by Alan Moore and David Gibbons.The film is set in an alternate history in the year of 1985 at the height of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, as a group of mostly retired superheroes investigates an apparent conspiracy against them and uncovers something even more grandiose and sinister, while their moral limitations are challenged by the complex nature of the circumstances.I love the action in this film and the director stayed true to it's source material and it is really amazing and fantastic to see. It took nearly a few years to get this movie on to the screen and finally principal photography took place in 2007 and concluded on 2008. As with previous film 300, Zack Snyder closed modeled his storyboards on the comic, but chose to not to shoot all of this film using green screens and opted for real sets instead and the film was released on March 6, 2009 and was released on DVD and Blu-Ray on July 21, 2009.The acting is great and my favorite character in WATCHMEN is Rorschach, played by Jackie Earle Haley and he did a very good job in the part. Malin Akerman and Patrick Wilson did struggle in a few scenes, but they were really great and entertaining in this film as Silk Spectre II and Nite Owl II.Matthew Goode plays the perfect hero and villain as Ozymandias and his performance was amazing and spectacular. Billy Crudup plays Doctor Manhattan and his performance was so emotional and sad as hell, but was really great. Carla Guigino is really amazing as Silk Spectre I and she is really great and fantastic in her part. Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian was really amazing and he does not have a lot of screen time, but he is really good and dramatic, but it's a shame that he died in a scene in this film, not the actor, but the part that Dean Morgan plays.I think the CGI and visual effects were really interesting in this film, along with 300, which I will review soon, this was really amazing for 2009 and this film really did good at the box office, but got a polarized reaction from critics and audiences. Some critics gave it overwhelmingly positive reviews for the dark and unique style on the superhero genre, the cast and the visual effects, while some reacted negatively for the same reason, as well as the R rating for ""strong graphic violence, sexuality, nudity and language"" and this film got a 65% ""fresh"" on Rotten Tomatoes and on Metacritic has an averaged score of 56%, but I don't think it should have gotten a mixed and polarized reaction from critics and audiences.I don't think that is really bad as critics said it to be and it is really good, but the love scene between Nite Owl II and Silk Spectre II is a little too romantic because we're seeing their chests and everything, but I just skipped that scene and went on to the next scene, so I would not have to see that part.Critics also liked and hated this film because of it's run time. The theatrical version is 162 minutes long -- 2 hours and 42 minutes -- and that is an hour and a half long. The director's cut is 186 minutes long -- 3 hours and 8 minutes -- and that's over three hours and a half long. I have not seen the other versions of this film, but I do think that the original version is really cool. In November 2009, a four-disc set was released titled ""Watchmen: The Ultimate Cut"" and this included the director's cut version re-edited with an animated cartoon as featured in the graphic novel, bringing the film's run time to 215 minutes long.Tyler Bates' musical score is a little confusing to describe because I like it and hate it, but he could have done better, but no hard feelings, right? The rest of the story is really amazing and awesometacular and just really cool as hell.Overall, WATCHMEN is not the best comic-book film adaptation in the world, it could have been bad, but Zack Snyder and Company did a really great job and I could have not been more pleased. So, I will give it a 6.5 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Not for fans yet also not for casual movie goers,"Zack Snyder somehow managed to fornicate with the corpse of the comic book and produce a bastard child that is rather untrue to the original story and amazingly also quite boring.To my surprise plot elements were changed even when it didn't seem to help the movie and the ending was changed as if Snyder, Hayter and Tse (screenwriters) had some sort of personal vendetta against one particular character. Ultra violence is added where it is unneeded, yet it is removed in the one scene where it was essential to the story and message.I read the comic rather recently and found it quite good, but unlike so many I didn't fall in love with it. I can see how it might have been something quite special if one read it around the time it was published, but to some degree I think it might have suffered like all giants that others have stood on the shoulders of - it doesn't seem all that special today.My point is that I wasn't a die hard fan of the story going in, but respected it and liked the message or question it presents, yet the movie annoyed, disappointed and perhaps worst of all bored me enough to make me want to write this review... and I LIKED 300...",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Very well made but somehow much darker than the comic,"This film is extremely well done considering the difficulty in getting the beloved source material right. However, the violence and depravity of the comic was somehow manageable in print - it didn't sting as much because it was just pen and paper and words on a page. But the film brings this world fully to life and it is a disturbing universe that shocks and startles. This film overwhelms the viewer a bit as the characters confront the age-old question of ends versus means head on - is it right to save the world if you must wreak havoc to do it? Is it villainy or heroism? The Watchmen wrestle with this question - there is no answer - only a choice of which side to take or to even take sides at all.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Good try, but it could have been so much more...","First things first, the movie is not on par with the original novel.The majority of elements that stand out in the movie, such as the order that events are presented, come straight from the novel. Thats not to say Snyder hasn't added anything to this movie at all. His casting choices (Dr Manhattan and Rorschach particularly) and directing style are two redeeming qualities to mention a few. The films problem is this. The original novel was so dense and each character story so detailed that Snyder spent the majority of the movie establishing their back stories. Because of this, the first portion of the film was excellent, intriguing and well developed. However, once we're allowed to digest this information, its as if Snyder suddenly realises that he has to wrap the film up. The second half feels rushed and passionless. Apart from Rorschach (whose acting was excellent throughout), the rest of the watchmen seem almost dull and wooden as the film reaches its 'climax'. The second problem with the movie is actually Snyders fault. Although he claims to have stuck rigidly to the original material, (apart from the ending which he can be forgiven for) Snyder seems to have misunderstood Alan Moore's vision. The novel did present the Watchmen as anything more than vigilantes. Apart from Dr Manhattan, non of them actually had superpowers, unlike in the movie were the Watchmen are seen to punch through walls, fall from great heights etc.In the end, its hats off to Snyder for filming the unfilmable...but... i can't help thinking it could have been something astonishing..",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
It's not an action flick - but it is a very watchable hybrid of SF and film noir with actual character development!,"I never read the original graphic novel, but I lived through the period covered by the film as a child and then a young adult. They have the seventies and eighties, and an alternate believable history, down very well. They look at the impact that have a living a breathing Superman level superhero might have had on the world of that time, and they do it very well.Don't expect and action flick, nor your typical ""superhero"" movie. If you do, you are going to be disappointed. Most of the characters are ""Batman"" level superheroes, not the Fantastic Four or the Hulk. This is more a cross between film noir, alternate history with a touch of Science Fiction, and a film on the human condition. It is incredibly violent at times, and it feels like a couple of the scenes were added just for the action. Sort of like comic relief, they keep the film from feeling totally claustrophobic. They avoid the utter hopelessness of Blade Runner. Then again, that is one of my favorite films.The movie is more about personalities, and both about being human and the extremes. Two of the main characters represent the extremes of the human condition, and it is interested to see how the film develops both. Even though the ""happy"" ending scene may serve to hide it, the film is very much a classic tragedy. The ending begs for a sequel, along the lines of ""be careful what you wish for.""

Who watches the watchmen?  Not me.,"Compared to the comic title, this movie would do without the graphic novel. The surprises and suspense from the dramatic scenes are simply not there. The real world, the arms race, controversy and blame over the cold war portrayed by the media is not there either. The dialogue between Mr. Manhattan and Ozymandias confuse me to pieces. Who is who? And why are the most important, and philosophical conversations between the two missing? As if to keep away the mysteries of the universe portrayed in the comic. On some bright sides, I see that the characters like Silk Spectre, Nightowl (eg sex and romance without the romance), Comedian and some other characters are of comic likeness. Rorschach is the only reason to watch the movie because of its comic accuracy though. And why blatantly nuke a bunch of random people without telling them why? People with no background or synopsis to the story> Practically skipping the whole 'genetically engineered psycho-virus' thing. The outlandish music and the portrayal of the 70s aren't really on par with the comic since it took place in the 80s. A dark setting, civilization's bleak outlook masked for it would be too hard to portray generations of civilization and its achievements on screen without a cast of a few thousand people. I mean come on Superheroes using superpowers (lacking emotion, and empathy to say the least), beating people up, and saving lives when in the comic it is clearly told that Dr. Manhattan is the only one with actual powers save the irrelevant dream-like sequences being added. And again with the computer generated images. Sticks out like a sore thumb. I guess it had to be done to the cat but I mean costume? At the high point of anyone's lifetime we suffer and feel like any fragile creature would and Alan Moore took advantage of that.....the movie shows it wasn't that easy, Pure eye candy.

A stand-out superhero movie,"Few days back I watched the movie ""Watchmen"". I had picked that movie purely for lack of other choices because I didn't want to see another super hero movie. To my pleasant surprise I loved this movie.To start with, I was taken-in with the concept that all the super heroes no more than mortal humans with imperfections embedded in them. They were mere vigilantes dressed up in funny costumes. There is of course one exception to them, Dr Manhatten, who out of an accident in a nuclear laboratory becomes something of a super human with quantum mechanical powers.To truly love this movie you need to have some knowledge of 1970-1980 history. You need to know about President Richard Nixon, Secretary Henry Kissinger, the cold war tension between US and then USSR and about the Vietnam war. You also need to have some idea of quantum mechanics. The movie stands out from rest of super hero movies in its portrayal of characters. There is no evil-minded villain from whom the heroes have to rescue the world. The heroes do not subscribe to the idea that every human life is equally valuable. But they all in general try to have rational and moral view of their own albeit the minor differences in opinion. Although I would not totally agree with the ending, I would still prefer such an ending to a run-of-the mill childish super-hero saved the day ending.To summarize, the movie is not for the regular super-man or spider-man loving fans.

For a more mature audience i think,"When i first watched this when it first came out, i was disappointed. It didnt fit the normal superhero movie i was looking for. Sure i loved the R rated part of the movie, but it wasnt Super enough for me.A few years later, after rewatching it, i learned to appreciate it alot more, for the then unique story it rolled out. Probably my decision influence by watching 20+ other superhero movies in between, but there you go.Definately a quality Super movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
This is one of the best films ever,"I have watched many movies in my life but very few of them are 10/10 movies, true masterpieces - The kind that you will remember for a life time, talk about at every chance, recommend to everyone, will watch many times etc..Watchmen IS one of them. You really need to watch the director's cut of this movie in order receive the full experience. This is not your typical superhero ""blockbuster"" movie, there is a lot of violence, gore and some sex. The bullshit level is very low and most of the events are logical and make sense.Watchmen does the best job in transferring how it feels like to be a superhuman that his powers and senses exceed human reality and captivity. Dr Manhattan's story will fascinate EVERY superhero enthusiasts out there, with emphasis on science/physics geeks.Zack Snyder did an amazing job in transferring the comics into the big screen, the soundtrack in also incredible..3 hours of joy. A must- watch 10/10 for me!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A Faithful Adaptation of One of the Best Graphic Novels of All Time,"I know, I know. This film came out almost 4 years ago and I'm just writing a review now. Oh, well. For what it's worth, I saw it in theaters the first night it was released.Being one of the many fans who loves Alan Moore's and David Gibbon's critically acclaimed graphic novel, I can say that this film does not disappoint me.It is almost as faithful as it can be, and yes, I believe that to be a positive thing.""Watchmen"" was a very polarizing film for most people. I don't think I came across one person who said ""it was alright"". It was either ""awesome"" or ""it sucked."" I was the former. Having not watched it since 2009, I put it in over the holidays, and my opinion of the film didn't change.Snyder's knowledge of the source material is obvious, and I prefer this to his latest comic book outing (Man of Steel)The standout for me is definitely Jackie Earle Haley's performance. I mean, how do you capture Walter Kovacs? How do you manage to portray Rorschach as well as he did? A very great performance that deserved a lot more credit in my opinion.Make no joke about it - this film is dark, violent and, once again, dark. It's not for everyone, and I can see why some people may have disliked it, especially considering most people probably went in thinking ""Oh! A superhero film! Looks fun!"" Plus all the promotional posters may have lead you to believe it was a superhero film. It's not. It's a vigilante film, and one that is a lot better than people seem to think.In conclusion, Snyder catches the world of ""Watchmen"" perfectly, and Haley's Rorschach is something to behold, in what has got to be the best possible adaptation of Watchmen you could have envisioned.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
pretty nice with some twist,I enjoyed the movie. It have a twist at the end. Some sex content and violent too. I enjoyed also to see DR Manhattan who was a nice character to see and to hear. I enjoyed also the womens and the different suits and personnalities of the heroes. Very good.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Awesome, Complex, and Dark","First of all great job to Zack Snyder for directing this movie! This was the perfect movie adaptation for the Watchmen Graphic novels. It was as if the characters were stepping out of the pages to the big screen. The Graphics of this film are absolutely stunning and gorgeous. I really enjoyed the dark and complex plot of the movie. In my opinion Rorschach and the comedian were the most interesting characters in the movie. Not everyone can understand and get the darkness of the movie and the violence might be a little to much for some people. Since the movie was a little too long, and I found some scenes between Laurie Jupiter and DR. Manhattan boring, I gave this movie an eight out of ten. But this movie is really good and I recommend it to people who like complex, dark and violent movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Watchmen is hit and miss.,"As a fan of the book, I was prepared for this movie to be terrible, but I am glad to say that it isn't.Did he adapt the ""unadaptable?"" No, he didn't even try. The newspaper stand guy, the comic reader, most of the normal people really were all left out. Rorschach wasn't a fully realized character; you never felt his loneliness or sadness, only his anger. Silk Specter was not the mean bitter, and strong-willed character she once was, instead she became Silk Follower who did whatever her current boyfriend did pretty much. A lot of the musical choices really killed the mood of the film at times. The violence in this movie is borderline gore. And at times (mostly during fight scenes) the movie feels too finished and over-stylized.In terms of tone, the unrelenting feeling of dread and uncertainty is not present in the film. Mostly due to the exclusion of the normal characters. The ending was changed to something that works better in film, but that also makes it less open-ended which is something I dislike.It's faithful enough to appease most fans, and changed enough to appease most movie-goers. But to me he (the director) shined it up so hard that it left an unmistakable glare. The sex, the violence, the music, the changes just didn't do it for me. Those things may have worked in 300, but they felt out-of-place in Watchmen. At times it felt like Watchmen the book (usually during Doc Manhattan's scenes.) and others where it felt just like any other movie.This isn't a bad movie, and it's a pretty faithful adaptation. It could have been a lot worse. But some things just held it back.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"This was well done,","For the most part. Definitely not like some other adaptations of printed material. Mayhap it was helped along by the fact that this was originally a graphic novel, nee comics series. In any event I applaud the directors and technicians involved. First Moore, then Gaiman, Morrison-- the UK has provided a number of artists in that medium who are in a class of their own when it comes to interpreting stories from a societal critique perspective, and mythological one, respectively. Where to begin? I don't believe it was necessary to read the GN before viewing, though it did help. Again, the story and background were well crafted to the screen, filling in much which otherwise would have been lost. Nixon's nose, oooohh the NOSE!!! LOL! All the real-life characters were well portrayed, imo. The ending, as they tend to do, was somewhat anti-climactic. But then, endings are very difficult things to pull off, even under the best of circumstances. All in all, this one is an A, perhaps -, but still top shelf. Of course, I've seen some stinkers lately, so my op is likely biased due to gratitude.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A faithful adaptation of a brilliant comic,"Zack Snyder's rendition of Watchmen is as faithful as you can get to the masterpiece of a graphic novel that is Watchmen. What was lost in the movie's mediocre cast and lack of a directorial flair was made up by the high-budget SFX and the brilliant writing of the source material itself. The reviewers which complain about the three-hour-long watch time clearly do not understand the entire premise of the original story itself. The excellent world-building and vast number of different characters and personalities, which come together to form a cohesive storyline, is half of what makes the comic what it is in the first place. While this is hard to adapt into a movie that will capture viewers' attention for the full three hours, Snyder did an excellent job in covering all the relevant plot arcs and characters. This is a textbook example of a movie-book adaptation that works.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

As Good As Anyone Could Expect It To Be.,"Given the variable quality of recent super-hero screen adaptations – from adequate to incompetent – this big, bold version of Alan Moore's legendary comic book is as good as anyone could realistically expect it to be. I read the compilation comic book (called a 'graphic novel' so that grown-ups didn't have to feel embarrassed about buying it) more than 20 years ago and was impressed by its sour, jaundiced view of the world – but then, I was only in my early twenties. And while I was impressed, I came away still thinking it was a good comic book and nothing more. Certainly no literary work of genius as some would have us believe. The makers here were left with something of a quandary: stay faithful to the book and you please the fans but get destroyed by the critics; make it more appealing and understandable to an audience with no knowledge of the book and you won't be able to hear the critic's praise over the howls of protest from the fans. Thankfully, they stayed (mostly) faithful to the book – even Rorshach's clipped way of speaking is retained.As I prefer film to cartoons, I prefer the film to the graphic novel. The film can – and does – create a depth of mood and atmosphere that the comic book has no hope of matching, and as I watched the terrific opening shots of an alternative past unfolding beneath the credits I started feeling really pleased I'd bothered to pick up a copy of the DVD. For the most part, the characters in Snyder's film (and until now I've considered him highly over-rated) are no cartoons come to life but real flesh and blood characters. They're not deep, full-rounded characters, admittedly, but they at least have a measure of depth lacking from comparable flicks. The film retains the dark, noirish atmosphere of the comic, and even though it's a long time since I read the comic, I'm pretty sure that many shots are exact replicas of the comic-book panels they're adapting.The violence, while difficult to take at times, is also in keeping with the comic – where gory scenes of mutilation can never be as shocking as when it's recreated on celluloid – and it's again credit to the makers that they didn't bow to the inevitable pressure to tone things down in order to get a lower age classification rating and so boost their profits. Remove the violence and you remove the guts of the story and all you're left with is a companion piece to the adventures of Peter Parker.If you haven't read the book you're probably initially going to struggle to understand what's going on – even though the film takes a long time filling in the back-story (which is why the running time is so long). Sadly, in this age of the post-MTV generation, this means a level of patience is required on the part of the audience that may be beyond the capabilities of some. However, if you've read the book, I'm pretty sure you're going to enjoy this. Let's just hope there isn't a Watchmen II",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Thank you Zack Snyder!,"This is only the second time I've watched Watchmen (2009) in its entirety and I can still say that this is still Zack Snyder's best movie in his filmography.Positives for Watchmen (2009):
This is one of those grand epic scales superhero movies that does everything perfect. You have this story that takes place in an alternate timeline where superheroes existed and they would help take part and effect events during the Vietnam War and the Cold War. Then, you have the phenonenal cast with Malin Akerman as Silk Spectre II, Billy Crudup as Doctor Manhattan, Matthew Goode as Ozymandias, Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl II, Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach, Carla Gugino as Silk Spectre, Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian and Stephen McHattie as Nite Owl and they are all awesome in this movie. For me, the standout character of this movie is easily Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. I love how some of our heroes are doing things for selfish reasons while the villain is doing things for great and noble causes. All of the classic Synderisms are done perfectly in this movie. You also have some animated sequences that were awesome to watch. The action is also spectacular where there are very few of them in the movie and you don't mind that. And finally, this is one of those epic slow burn movies that takes its time with its storytelling and everything pays off at the end of its lengthy runtime.Overall, Watchmen (2009) is a legendary achievement in the superhero and comic book movie genre. This is easily one of my favorite superhero movies of all time and it is my favorite Zack Snyder movie of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
words cannot describe,"I consider myself a very open-minded person, I can enjoy over the top violence, gore, stupid jokes etc. but this, words cannot describe the disgust I feel towards this ""film""If I knew it was directed by Zach Snyder I would expect it to be completely stupid, but perhaps entertaining.. this movie was unbearable!I can't believe this movie is rated so high, anyone who liked this crap has to be brain-dead! The idiotic script, the boredom, the inappropriate songs, the final message.The only good thing about this movie is that it's so easy now to spot idiots on IMDb.P.S. and wtf was that excuse for a Nixon makeup",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Interesting but graphic,"Watchmen was a very fast paced superhero film that included many good components and some that I would remove. With emotional tensions at an all-time high with a group of dangerous individuals with the country on the brink of nuclear war in 1985 and 1986, Zack Snyder takes the audience on a rollercoaster to find the answers with a group of vengeful superheroes. This film included the struggle between humanity and emotions as the characters battled to find what is right for their specific lives.I thought DC mixed dialogue and action well to keep the audience engaged. As a rated ""R"" movie, it fulfilled the reigns of the rating completely, leaving no imagination with language and graphic scenery that claimed a large piece of the movie. The constant struggle for revenge brought out the violence in some, while the heat of passion in others.The constant action breaks evenly with dialogue and backstory to complete the character arcs to inform the audience of how some of the superheroes gained their powers and what struggle they had to deal with that brought them to their superhero state today. Although some of the dialogue could have been removed to shorten the film from three hours to about two to two and a half at most.In addition to plot and story, the film offers a great detail of visual scenes, especially with Dr. Manhattan and his elevated state of nuclear energy with CGI. Costumes and visual effects all move smoothly and consistently throughout the entire film. Camera angles and lighting provide a lot of effect with emotion to help drive specific feelings straight to the heart of the viewers.The overall journey of the film of discovery and decisions of fate leaves us wondering what will happen next and how will they survive with the common man?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Relatively close to the original scenario but...,"While most of the original scenario is still there, this movie has two significant drawbacks. The first one is of course Matthew Goode, who lacks the charisma and presence required for such a key character as Ozymandias. It is unbelievable that there has been such an error in casting. I don't say Goode is a bad actor, just that he cannot impersonate Veidt. Also, the part about the origin and the past of Veidt/Ozymandias are weak compared to the weight they bring in the comic. The second is the chosen end, that differs from the original book and, in my opinion, is much weaker. Except for that, the movie stays relatively true to the impressive original scenario...",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A great starts that leads to a mellow flick with many lengths,"Here comes another superhero movie after all those Supermen, Batmen, Spidermen and so on. Many movie experts simply start getting tired of all these quite similar movies and I only watched this one because somebody told me that this was a standout of its genre. The story is indeed interesting as somebody tries to murder a gang of retired superheroes that all have their dark sides in this atmospheric movie that has some film noir tendencies and a couple of solid ideas.This all sounds promising but the movie is simply way too long and has many lengths. The film kicks off very well and especially the narrative parts of Rohrschach, the best character among the superheroes played by the best actor in this film with Jackie Earle Haley, is highly addicting. The movie simply develops too many flashbacks and uninspired side stories that slow down the starting dynamics after a while. Especially the typical Hollywood love story stereotypes bring what could have been a different kind of movie on a more commercial and ordinary flick for the masses. The dialogues are quite cheesy and there are too many of them. The characters are not sympathetic enough to really care about them. If they had all died, I would not have been unsatisfied. In my opinion, there is quite a waste of time and potential in this film.The acting is not bad but not outstanding, the action sequences are the same and the story has its ups and downs so that the only solid thing are the special effects but they can't save this movie from mediocrity. Another letdown is the ending of the flick. I've waited for more murders, chasing scenes and the proposal of diversified possibilities to guess who's behind the crimes. In the end, there aren't so many murders and the final solution doesn't come as a big surprise and what happens in the big boom just won't come. The conclusion is not that standard and can be described as courageous as it differs from your usual happy end but I disliked the movie's philosophy and would have expected something more emotional, engaging and surprising.In the end, I would only recommend this movie to those who like superhero movies and would like to see a darker side of some heroic characters. Anybody who likes Hollywood cinema and modern special effects will surely adore this movie. Anybody who's expecting something gripping, original or profound should simply avoid this kind of movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Faithful to the Graphic Novel,"I read the graphic novel Watchmen for the first time the day before seeing the film adaptation. I felt it was important to take in the story Alan Moore had created in the way he had envisioned it before seeing it adapted by somebody else. Having done this, the film version held few surprises. I wouldn't say that the lack of surprises isn't necessarily a bad thing, but rather it means that the film closely follows the original graphic novel. I think the film will please ardent fans who have been waiting to see the story on the big screen. CGI is now at a point where it can do justice this story justice, and even the scene on Mars was fairly well done. The violence in the film was appropriate (this is definitely not a film for children) considering part of the story is about these superheroes that are borderline sociopaths. What I felt was lacking in the film was in the socio-political commentary that was prominent in the book. It was definitely touched on in the film version, but it felt softened in the film as if to say the action was more important. I feel that this political side seems to be an important part of Alan Moore's work. In all, I have never been a big fan of graphic novels adapted into film, but I felt that the film version of Watchmen was entertaining and will make fans happy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
You didn't see this coming.,"This movie is really difficult to rate as it explores quite a different genre. We all have grown up watching good Superheroes who had nothing wrong. But what about a superhero who is completely flawed, still he has to take the chances for everyone's best interest. The world can't always be black or white. There also lies a grey area between. That's where this entire film revolves.I really liked the story, direction and cinematography (One extra point for Rorschach and Big Figure jail bathroom scene). This could have been masterpiece from Zack Snyder. The only area where the movie struggle is the slow narrative. Though movie goes back and forth often in timeline but sometimes you tend to loose interest. Saw 2 hour 43 minute film on Netflix, but even I was tempted to check my phone due to the slow narrative.Overall this is one of those movie which makes you think what was right and what was wrong. At the end of the day both are right at their side and it's all about your perspective. This is Most underrated Zack Snyder work I feel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Excellent musical soundtrack in an otherwise mediocre movie.,"For a movie to be effective as entertainment, it has to tell a coherent story. This movie does not do that. Instead the story is a convoluted series of disconnected scenes. Also, the use of an alternative future does not work. It is too contrived. The superheroes are back, but so what? The acting was good, especially that of Stephen McHattie who is the star of the movie. The actor who plays the Comedian also gives an excellent performance. But the entire production seems to be little more than an animated comic book, which is not surprising since the movie is based on comic book characters. However, this movie offers one excellent feature: the music. The musical soundtrack includes ""Sounds of Silence"" by Simon and Garfunkle. Because of the musical soundtrack the movie, if not great, is at least watchable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
