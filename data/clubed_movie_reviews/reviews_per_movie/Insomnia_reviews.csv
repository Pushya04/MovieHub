Nolan can now be considered one of the best!,"INSOMNIA is not only the third film of acclaimed director Christopher Nolan (his first two were FOLLOWINGS and MEMENTO), but also a film that is able to intertwine the acting talents of three Academy Award winners.  Al Pacino plays a celebrated cop who is asked to work on the case of a murdered girl in Alaska.  Hilary Swank plays the local law enforcement who has her eyes on making a big case.  Robin Williams plays a troubled Alaskan writer.  Without giving anything away, INSOMNIA is definitely worth it.  Some may see it, and be disappointed.  One way to steer away from this failure is think of INSOMNIA as a psychological thriller rather than a ""Shoot 'em up"" thriller. INSOMNIA is story about loyalty and human emotion.  Don't get me wrong, the movie is thrill-packed, but let's just say--You don't need blood and gore to make the audience members be on the edge of their seats (which I was). INSOMNIA hits all of its points including acting, directing, screenwriting, and cinematography.  It's a first class thriller with great characters.  On a side note...Pacino is worthy of an Oscar for his performance, Williams is equally excellent, and Swank also deserves recognition for complete scope of acting.  A job well done by these three actors, and especially the man behind the curtain, Christopher Nolan!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hardly a sleeper,"As said in my reviews for his masterpiece 'Memento' and the fascinating 'The Prestige', Christopher Nolan has always struck me as a very talented film-maker, and most of his films are ones that have impressed me a lot. Even weaker efforts, where his ambition can get in the way, have a good deal to admire. His films are all impeccably crafted technically, and often entertaining and thought-provoking, also knowing how to get good performances out of talented casts.'Insomnia' is not one of Nolan's best films, but not his worst. For me it's somewhere in the middle if ranking his films, 'Memento' being his best and, while with a lot of impressive elements, 'Interstellar' being the one that impressed least. It shows fidelity to the Norwegian original, but doesn't go so far that it's a pale retread, in a way that is summed up very well by Roger Ebert.Nolan directs with impeccable style and sense of atmosphere, as well as an ability to tell a potentially convoluted story with clarity without resorting to excess and over-ambition. Much of 'Insomnia' is exceptionally well made, while beautiful Alaska has rarely been more oppressive as well while the cinematography has grit and class. David Julyan's music score is not quite as complex as that for 'Memento', but has a very effective eeriness.The script is tight and thoughtful, and the story, filled with neat twists and turns, is hugely compelling and atmospheric, never being too simple but complex enough to still be understandable and be respectful to the viewer. The cat and mouse stuff could have been predictable and convoluted but executed in masterly hair-raising but also quiet tension.Performances are all strong across the board. While underused somewhat, Martin Donovan and especially Hilary Swank are great here. It is however Al Pacino and Robin Williams who are even better. Pacino gives perhaps his best performance since 'Heat' and he has to me definitely not been on this amount of blistering form as he is in 'Insomnia'. Williams is cast against type, and he plays a genuinely terrifying character with menace but also dignity and restraint.Flaws are only a couple, with the film ending too conveniently and some of the editing being a touch too jumpy.All in all, a gripping film and hardly a sleeper. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Excellent Performances, Especially Williams","One doesn't expect to feel claustrophobic in Alaska, but that's exactly the effect when watching ""Insomnia"". The primary story is about the police investigation of the murder of a high-school girl in a small Alaskan town. Through the pull of old acquaintances and political necessity, two LA homicide detectives (Pacino and Martin Donovan) are dispatched to the scene to help the locals. The political necessity concerns a graft investigation in which the two LA detectives are key suspects. One is thinking of copping a plea, so they are spirited out of LA to avoid the investigative light. Then they find themselves in the 24-hour day of the Alaskan summer where the two plot lines collide; the murder investigation and the graft. And what a collision it is.The insomnia of the title is suffered by the Pacino character, who can't sleep during the movie's 7-day span. And each day his eyes are more sunken, he's groggier, less focused. This parallels his descent into guilt, remorse, and desperation. But to provide any more details would be to give away key plot elements. ""Insomnia"" is gripping and it's best to see the movie cold.The acting, especially Robin Williams as the key suspect in the child slaying, is top notch. Williams is made for these roles, he should kiss the suck-up feel-good stuff goodbye for good. The photography is excellent, Alaska never looked so ominous, and the direction delivers the goods. Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Do Not Sleep,"I didn't know that 'Insomnia' was based on a Norwegian movie of the same title. Otherwise, I would have watched the original film first. What convinced me to watch this one was the cast that included three super-talented actors and the director Christopher Nolan ('loved his 'Memento'). Thus, my comment is pretty much just about the movie rather than how it compares to the original.There's really a lot to like about. This isn't merely a 'catch-the-bad-guy' thriller but a character driven psychological drama. It starts as a who done it, then turns into a how done it to why done it to what are you going to do about it. While it is the complex characters that stand out, the details of the murder case(s) are very well presented and the layered twists add well to the plot. 'Insomnia' is fascinating to look at. The production design is of very high quality and the cinematography is breathtaking. The attention to detail and the emphasis of the visuals that make the viewer experience Dormer's sleep deprived world is stunning. Incidentally, I was watching it very late at night and perhaps that is the best time to watch it.Nolan's style of execution is remarkable. Daylight is used very effectively as a character of its own. In a way, it's the antagonist of the movie that leads to Dormer's mental 'deterioration'. It's a dark movie set in constant daylight. Then there's the clever use of fog and floating logs which in a way act as pathetic fallacies. Blood also plays a symbolic role. The quietness of a cold and gloomy Alaska is both intense and chilling.Al Pacino proves again what an excellent actor he is. It's amazing how he eerily looks the part with bags under his eyes, a clumsy gait, stooped shoulders and a continuous expression of fatigue while he dives into the depth of an extremely complex character. Robin Williams skillfully downplays his part as the latently manipulative Finch as he takes advantage of Dormer's vulnerability. Hillary Swank brings an air of freshness as the rookie detective who also has to make a difficult decision towards the end. Maura Tierney makes very good use of her few scenes.On the flip side, it may seem as though 'Insomnia' loses focus in some scenes as it appears to derail. Of course there are different ways of looking at this. The ending feels rushed and is very predictable. Also Williams's Finch could have been more developed considering the important role he has. Nonetheless, it's a well-made film. I intend to watch the Norwegian version to see how it compares but on its own, Nolan's 'Insomnia' is a fascinating experience and the cast and crew deserve all the praise for finally putting it all together.",,Anonymous,Mystery
It Made Me Tired,"Al Pacino's character looked tired when he arrived in the Alaskan town. As he attempts to reconcile a serious mistake, he grows wearier and wearier. Enter Robin Williams, a sociopath who plays a cat and mouse game with Pacino. Balance that against the perceptive and admiring Hillary Swank and a lot of baggage from Pacino, and you have the ingredients for a terrific thrill a minute film. I found myself rooting for the Pacino character even though there is a level of dishonesty that will be hard to reconcile. He must cover some huge tracks. There are some issues with Williams' ability to know things that are a little far fetched. Many villains fall into that gap, but that's OK. We take him for what he is. It's an engaging movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Great, compelling piece of work!","I was really looking forward to this film, and I'm glad to say that I wasn't the least bit disappointed.  First of all, I was glad to see Al Pacino on screen again.  It seems like it's been a while since I've seen him on screen.  I think the last film he was in was ""Any Given Sunday.""  Pacino yet again delivers a brilliant performance, strapping the audience in for a wild ride through the emotionally scarred mind of Detective Will Dormer.  It seemed like I could feel his every emotion throughout the course of the movie.  Because this is a character-driven story that revolves around Dormer, his pain, anguish and guilt on account of accidentally taking his partner's life, constant insomnia and subsequent threats by his nemesis, played by Robin Williams as a writer of trashy detective novels who's fascinated by Dormer and blackmails him by threatening to spill out the secret of Dormer shooting his partner.  As for Robin Williams, he is fully convincing as the reclusive novelist/murderer of a 17-year-old girl.  I suspected, from the trailers, that he'd play a serial killer.  I wouldn't exactly classify his character as a serial killer, but he is the antagonist and a murderer and Williams plays the role perfectly, never underplaying it and never overplaying it.  He could've went over-the-top, playing a totally ruthless killer who cackles at the thought of murdering someone in cold blood.  Though he's not our sympathetic character, you do feel sympathy for him at times.  And I like how the story creates this little cat-and-mouse game between the two characters, each one plagued by skeletons in the closet.  Oscar-winner Hilary Swank delivers another fine performance, and I was stunned to see how amazingly attractive she looks, after having seen her gender-bending role as Brandon Teena in ""Boys Don't Cry.""Christopher Nolan is the acclaimed director of ""Memento"" and he scores yet again, with this beautifully constructed thriller.  I was intrigued from start to finish.  Nolan's use of lighting is dark and murky, wonderfully setting the noirish tone.  Nolan shows great promise as an up-and-coming director, and with a good outlet he can possibly become the next Kubrick. I greatly look forward to seeing his next project, whenever that may be.I recommend ""Insomnia"" to anyone who loved Nolan's previous ""Memento"" or anyone who simply enjoys a great, multi-faceted mystery/thriller that will keep you guessing at every turn.  I think it's too early to vote this movie as one of the best films of 2002, but it's a possible candidate.  We don't see too many ""great"" films anymore, and whenever they're out there it's good to take advantage.My score:  9 (out of 10)",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This film will give you Insomnia!,"Who doesn't love Al Pacino? Anyone.....Come on..... there at least should be one hater! Guess there is not. Al Pacino is loved by everyone who has seen him as ""Michael Vito Corleone"" in The Godfather Trilogy or the ruthless ""Tony Montana"" in Scarface. These films were the highlights of his career and even though he isn't as memorable as Will Dormer in Insomnia, it is hard not to give him an honorable mention. Insomnia is referred to as a ""Cat and Mouse"" thriller and it proved that it is one because of the whole chase thing between Will Dormer, a cop, and a local writer who goes by the name of Walter Finch, a man who is under the suspicion of killing a teen. This is proved even more when there is an actual ground chase between them two on the logs in the flowing river. That scene was full of heart pounding action and added a bit of intrigue that made you appreciate the film a little bit more. The film would have been unknown to me if there weren't the three Oscar winners, Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and Hilary Swank that made this thriller for what it is, also if Christopher Nolan hadn't directed it. He is truly a great director. Steven Spielberg has to watch out for the might of Nolan. Al Pacino was absolute and admirable in Insomnia therefore making him the best actor in the whole film. His role as a tough cop was fascinating and hypnotizing. Robin Williams, who portrays Walter Finch, was not as great as Al's however he still doesn't disappoint. This is not Robin Williams best role but it MIGHT be his most evilest role in his ""Evil Trilogy"". Hilary Swank's character Ellie Burr made you think that she was unnecessary but as the film reaches its climax you realize that she plays an important part. Swank's performance could not rival against her other roles in ""Million Dollar Baby"" or ""Boy's don't Cry"" however she is agreeable but not fun to watch. The films chilly, or spooky, atmosphere is the best in any movie, I have ever seen so far. It just makes the films setting really home-sweet-home. The scenery at the beginning was beautiful as the plane flew over the ice and glaciers of Alaska.In Nightmute, Alaska, seventeen year old resident Kay Connell is found murdered. As a favor to the local Nightmute police chief, two Los Angeles Robbery Homicide police detectives, Will Dormer and Hap Eckhart, are called in to assist in the investigation. Although renowned in the police world, both Dormer and Eckhart are facing some professional issues back in Los Angeles. In Nightmute, Dormer has a major case of insomnia due to a combination of the incessant midnight sun and from a secret he is carrying. This insomnia is causing him to be delusional. Something he is not dreaming about is that the murderer has contacted him, informing him all about the murder and the fact that he knows everything that is going on with Dormer. They begin a symbiotic relationship in keeping secrets for each individual's benefit. But ambitious young local detective, Ellie Burr, might piece the story together on her own.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Clear Cut,"Insomnia is almost a collage of several other mystery films (namely Se7en) tied into one, but not distinctively. Although it wasn't completely repetitive, it was as cliché as detective work goes, and the movie didn't stand out one way or another. Whether it's the elusive murderer on the loose or the mentally plagued cop who's trying his best, this movie is predictable and lacks ingenuity.Accompanying the lack of creativity, the prime actors and actresses had average performances and the emotional conviction in the roles was often lacking. A straight plot followed by routine dialogue made Insomnia rather mundane and an effort to watch. Although there were particular exciting scenes, they were rather short and sparse. The resources were there, but execution was a miss.Whether it's L.A. Confidential, The Usual Suspects, Se7en or any other great mystery movie, these all had a strong emotional attachment that hook viewers into truly empathizing with the protagonists and mystery at hand. Unfortunately in Insomnia, it's almost like you already know the fate of the characters, and still don't care.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Although it moves a bit slow at times, still a good suspense drama","Although I don't think this is one of Christopher Nolan's strongest films, but it was still pretty good and had a good story which is what his films are mostly known for. One of the quotes from the movie is ""a good cop can't sleep because a piece of the puzzle is missing and a bad cop can't sleep cause his conscience won't let him"". And that is what the story is about while getting blackmailed by the killer who tries to convince the detective that they are both in the same situation. And if the end sometimes justify the means. Unfortunately the killer isn't the least bit interesting although the film starts off by making the killer seem like a interesting character. Although the film moves a bit slow at times, has a well woven plot that will keep most audiences intrigued from beginning to end with it's drama and suspense. The main reason I saw this is because it's a Christopher Nolan film and it didn't really disappoint.7.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Mesmerising performance from Pacino,I used to think that nobody could come close to Robert De Niro when it comes to who was the best actor in Hollywood but as the years went by he started to pick some real Turkeys and a in the mean while an old hand was gradually taking the crown from De Niro and that is Al Pacino. In Insomnia he has picked another cracker of a film that although not fast paced is brilliantly acted and is very watchable. Hilary Swank is superb as is Robin Williams and its refreshing to see him taking a serious role instead of sentimental trash like Patch Adams but as per usual it is Al Pacino who steals the show. He plays an insomniac Cop who gets intangled in a murder case and gets into trouble after accidently killing his partner . I cant think of an actor who looks more tired than Pacino anyway so he was perfect for the role. The story is OK but to be honest the film is more about the performances than the plot. 8 out of 10,8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Atmospheric, tangled thriller","A veteran detective with skeletons in his closet, whisked away to a foreign land (for whatever reason) - it's been done many times. Most of the time, the ""is he dirty or isn't he?"" routine is frustrating (""Black Rain"", ""Boom Town"", ""Rising Sun"", etc.). BUt it's different with ""Insomnia""; you pretty much know the main character is a dirty cop, so it's really about the walls closing in, which is actually refreshing. And it adds levels.Other than that, it's the talent of the main cast that makes this fresh. Pacino, Swank and Williams are all terrific (although Williams is perfectly at home with quietly deranged; it's beyond creepy). And Pacino is well-suited for a guy who can't get any sleep. He makes run-down look easy.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Christopher Nolan does it again!,"First off, Christopher Nolan is one of my biggest influences when it comes to film and screen writing. With films such as Following and Memento, both of which reached cult following levels, he is well on his way to a successful Hollywood career. Then, today came, his 3rd film was released, Insomnia. Based on a 1997 Norwegian film written by Nikolaj Frobenius and Erik Skjoldbjærg, Insomnia is a true work of art in the world of film.Christopher Nolan takes all that was the 1997 film, and brings it to the next level, using his own style of directing, a musical score with shades of Memento, and an all star cast. Al Pacino and Robin Williams pulls out the greatest performances of their careers in the past decade, if not in their ENTIRE careers in my eyes.Pacino once again excels in the role of master dective, while Williams takes this chance to show his ""dark side"", and he does it so well. I can only hope that this is a rebirth of Robin Williams, and as it stands with his upcoming film One Hour Photo (which he once again plays a dark, psychotic role), it seems to be just that! Hilary Swank also pulls out what is the greatest role of her career.Insomnia brings you in as an audience, with it's perfectly woven plot, with a film noir feel to it, just as Nolan's first two films. It is a rollercoster ride of drama and suspense as you watch Al Pacino from the very beginning unravel, and the rest of the story and his past catches up with him. I can not say much more about it, as I do not wish to spoil anything about if for you, but I do want to say this... ...go see it, right now, and enjoy. If you love crime/mystery/drama films with that wonderful Film Noir feel to it, you will love this film. If that isn't your thing, then the performances of the three main actors are worth the price of a ticket in itself.Finally I just want to say, that Insomnia proves once and for all that Christopher Nolan will indeed be a force to reckoned with in Hollywood. I've said it before, and I'll say it again... ...Christopher Nolan is well on his way to becoming the Hollywood legend which he proves he is capable of becoming.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Chris Nolan's worst is still good,"As is evident by now, anyone who has enjoyed Christopher Nolan's movies would, most probably, Insomnia at the bottom of their favorite from Nolan. While people who don't enjoy the Nolan brand of cinema will mark Insomnia as their favorite from Nolan. Simply because, this movie is a remake and while has many of Nolan's signature styles, it is not as evident as it is in his other superior works (IMHO).Nolan's movies (from Following to Inception) is built around the concept of duality. Insomnia has a similar theme running through it, that of Al Pacino's character living the life of a honest role-model while still doing things reprehensible, thus showing two sides of life. Al Pacino and Robin Williams are in supreme form and the cinematography by Wally Pfister is gorgeous. But the 'quickness' that is associated with other Nolan movies (even BB) is visibly absent in this one. It is by no means a bad movie, but the slow burn of the thriller does dampen the effect. Not a must watch, but an intriguing thriller that well matches its Swedish inspiration.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not As Good as Original, But Still A Good, Dark Tale","I erred in giving into temptation to watch the original Norwegian ""Insomnia"" on IFC just a couple of weeks before seeing this Hollywood re-make directed by indie-credible ""Memento"" Christopher Nolan with a very effective Academy Award-winning cast.The original movie had a tiny budget and also an excellent cast, led by the terrific Swede Stellan Skarsgård, growing as pale as that relentless sunshine during the course of the film; the usually haggard-looking Al Pacino interprets his insomnia visually through an ever more haggard face.Though the original film isn't given as the source material until well into the closing credits, this follows the main thrust of the story closely. The changes, though, are both subtle and significant and intriguingly as American as Sam Spade when the mise en scene gets moved to Alaska (actually shot in Vancouver). Significantly, there is less sex and more morality.Hilary Swank's character is more naive than her counterpart; Martin Donovan's character's role is more central to the story and, of course, Robin Williams gets more screen time than his original counterpart, as the conflict is less in the lead's mind and more on the screen as a duel. The plot twists are done differently so I shamefully got confused between the two movies.While not as overwhelming as the original, I do think this version should rank right up with the great detective/cop-does-the-right-thing movies, and the plot makes more sense than ""The Big Sleep.""(originally written 6/16/2002)",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not a bad thriller but could've been better,"""Insomnia"" is a thriller that has some big names attached to it: Al Pacino, Robin Williams & Hilary Swank; all designated as 'Academy Award Winner' on the movie poster. Director Christopher Nolan is also well-known, though his only Oscar nomination is for a co-screen writing credit.The story concerns a veteran cop (Al Pacino) sent to Alaska along with his partner in order to aid in a murder investigation. Through a series of events cop & killer (Robin Williams) eventually come face to face, though under circumstances that pit them against each other in a battle of wits.The cast, as previously noted, is stocked with Oscar-caliber talent. However, it seems to me that those casting the film went for big name actors over others who may have been better suited to the parts. I have no complaints about Al Pacino as he's played this sort of character enough times to be able to do it in his sleep. On the other hand, Robin Williams just didn't convince me as a murderer in the usual Hollywood 'criminal mastermind' mold. Hilary Swank was decent enough but her role demanded none of the skill that won her two well-deserved Oscars. The movie makers should have skipped Swank's price tag and spent the money on better support because most of it is merely television-caliber.The script is a pretty good one if you like thrillers of this sort, although it's been done to death by now. Nolan's direction throws in some admittedly breathtaking outdoor scenery while the more intimate scenes are no better than average. The score by David Julyan is decent enough but I can't really recall anything particularly interesting or memorable about it.On the whole, the film is a perfectly acceptable thriller though it falls into the trap of placing more emphasis on stars than story. However, I expect that fans of the genre will not find it difficult to overlook the supposed faults that I've outlined.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Almost, but not quite","The film Insomnia, based on an earlier Norwegian film, is an almost winner.By acclaimed directed Christopher Nolan, (Memento,) this is a bet that almost, but not quite, pays off, in the sense of waiting for the ""other shoe to drop."" It is not so much a murder mystery as it is a character study, but, as with the rest of the film, it's almost but not quite that, also.Al Pacino is Detective Will Dormer, who has been summoned to Nightmute, Alaska by an old friend to help solve the murder of a 17-year-old girl. Pacino is a man on the verge of many things: retirement, age, and moral collapse, as we learn early on. He and his partner, Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are being investigated by Internal Affairs back in Los Angeles. On the way to Alaska, Hap informs Dormer that he intends to ""cut a deal"" and take whatever comes of it. This doesn't please Dormer in the slightest, and he gives the impression he'll fight the investigation, and his partner's selling-out, but fate has a different idea. Early in the investigation, Dormer accidentally shoots Hap. With his partner now dead, Dormer has nothing more to fear from IA. Or so he imagines.Enter Walter Finch, played by Robin Williams; he is the main suspect in the murder, and has also seen the shooting of Hap, or so he informs Dormer. Now the plot will weave around these two, almost exclusively, as they play their game of manipulation and one-upmanship. And here's where the film begins to lose its own compass.First, I had a bit of a problem with the fact that the two detectives from L.A. were in Alaska to begin with. Supposedly, this is an official trip, but I have trouble believing that the Los Angeles Police Dept would send two of its people to Alaska for such a mundane reason. Yes, it's murder, but the ease with which these two solve the case and pinpoint the murderer is just so fast that it's hard to believe the Alaskans couldn't have done the same, and done it sooner. Second, the character of Ellie Burr, (Hilary Swank) who has made a study of Detective Dormer's work for her academy thesis, is just a little too worshipful. And what a coincidence that she should be there in Nightmute, involved in this case. It's a little too contrived, in my opinion. Hilary Swank, a wonderful actress, is overqualified for the wide-eyed wonderment she portrays here. There's not enough depth in her character to hold your interest.Third, we never really get a chance to pick apart Finch, Robin Williams' character. We only know a little about him, but nothing essential, and nothing that adds to our understanding of why he committed this foul deed in the first place, or what is driving him to do what he does. We come into this situation, ""in the middle"" and leave it pretty much the same way when the movie ends. There's a solution, but no enlightenment.There are two other interesting characters that also tease us into wanting to know more, but never give up any information beyond that: the hotel desk clerk, played by Maura Tierney, and Police Chief Nyback, played by Paul Dooley, are both characters I would have liked to see developed into ""whole"" people. Especially Tierney's character, who says one of the most fascinating lines in the film, something about how people in Alaska are either born there or are there because they've escaped something a lot worse. With a lead-in like that, it was a shame not to follow up on it.Mostly, we are treated (?) to extreme closeups of Pacino as he spirals down into his insomniac, ethical black-hole, and teasers of the menace Robin Williams might actually be hiding underneath that parka. In neither case is it enough, or satisfying, and as the film winds down into its inevitable conclusion, we are left with a hollow feeling that we just didn't get enough. We can draw conclusions, but they are not the point; the point is what makes these things happen in the first place, and that's a question that goes unanswered.Additionally, there are some recurring cut-scenes of the murder itself, which are never explained or illuminated. They appear as memory flashes, but we never see them in their entirety, which is extremely annoying. Overall, the film looked as if it were originally a lot longer, and was edited down to fit its current time. If that's not the case, then it's just too minimalist to make a satisfying story.The plot is, or could be, a very good one, with a bit more explanation. There is a lot of atmospheric buildup, but in the end, not much suspense or tension for the viewer. The characters tease us with development, never quite making us understand them, or their motives; they feel thinly painted, and shadowy. Not a tour-de-force for director Nolan, though Pacino and Williams give their parts all the nuances they can.I left wanting more.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good But Not Nolan's Best,"Will Dormer is a veteran LA detective, recognized for his investigative skills, noted by his peers as a good cop.I was expecting a typical detective story with lots of puzzles and thrilling mysteries, hoping to see why Will Dormer is acclaimed for his job. But this is not really the focal point of the story. Just around 25 minutes in the movie, you'll already see a major lead about the suspect.While I understand that the story begins after the foggy beach chase, I was left wanting for more build up and mystery in the investigation. It really felt rushed.The first encounter with Walter Finch at the rocky beach put me in the edge of my seat. It's a pretty good cat and mouse chase but the real surprise is the accidental shooting of Hap that really sent me in shock.I'm not really a fan of the ending. I think it's predictable and too safe for an interesting lead character. And Ellie Burr, towards the end of the film, suddenly became too soft for Will that she tried to cover up the truth for him.Insomnia is a character-driven, psychological thriller. It explores the character's moral judgement on how they will navigate their way through difficult choices where their principles are at stake.Robin Williams as Walter Finch doesn't appeal to me that much but I love every bit of Al Pacino's acting as Will Dormer. Those sleep-deprived eyes, hunchback posture, and piercing stares look so authentic you can feel his weariness. Overall, it's a decent film but I'm not obsessed with it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A bone-chilling masterpiece,"Al Pacino is an L.A. cop who's come to Alaska with his partner to investigate a brutal homicide. Hilary Swank is the Alaskan detective who admires his work and methods. Robin Williams is the killer they're hunting down. (All three are Oscar winners by the way, and deliver performances that are definitely worthy of an Oscar.) Throughout the film, Pacino's character's mind wreaks havoc; the Alaskan town is so far up north, they get ""white nights"" (I.e. the sun doesn't set for half the year). As a result, he cannot sleep.With ""Insomnia"", Christopher Nolan joins my list of directors I admire. ""Insomnia"" owes much of its stunning success to the directorial choices Nolan makes. The most difficult task of the movie is this: how exactly can you show the audience Pacino's increasingly disoriented, sleepless mind-frame, without boring them? I think Nolan handles this expertly.The cast deliver stellar performances, in particular Robin Williams. His character is undoubtedly psychotic. What a temptation for Williams to steal the show with a display of angry shouting, of pure psychopathic hostility, of maniacal laughter! But no. He avoids this and goes for a far different touch. His character talks of extremely disturbing things in a very calm, matter-of-fact way, making his performance far more bone-chilling. As much as I love Williams' comic roles, I have to admit he's practically unrivalled in ""serious"" acting.Another thought: although this is a film I like to consider a thriller, it is very much like a film noir as well. Personally, I love the plots of film noirs, but I can't stand the relentless usage of shadows and dark lighting. ""Insomnia"" shatters these guidelines. It is a very dark film with lots and lots of light. The effect is interesting to say the least.This film is a thriller, and consequently, I'm choosing my words carefully in order to spoil as little of the film as possible. I highly recommend seeing this film— I was blown away. ""Insomnia"" is also very deep, powerfully invoking themes of guilt and restlessness.

Great movie...until the last five minutes,"I saw this movie at a preview screening last night.  Throughout the movie I was on the edge of my seat, waiting for the resolution of an engaging, suspenseful film.  Well, I got one.  It's too bad that it was one of the most anticlimactic endings I have ever seen.  Despite great performances from Al Pacino and Robin Williams, I walked out of the theatre severely disappointed.  It's sad that the final few minutes of the film can ruin an otherwise good movie, but it happened here.  I'm still upset at the terrible ending.  I gave the movie a 7, but only because I'm feeling generous, and 95% of the movie was great.  Still, it's worth seeing.  You may not think so from the review, but that's just me venting.  It's a very good film.Perhaps I was just expecting something more Memento-like of an ending from Christopher Nolan.  You can judge for yourself.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"If there's a good European movie made, an American version will follow shortly","I think most movie remakes are totally unnecessary because 1) they either show nobody came up with a good story and therefore just took the easy way out by recycling an old one, 2) some director thought he could surpass the original and almost surely failed to do so, or 3)the movie's foreign and American's don't like that If you think number 3) isn't true, just think about it for a second. If there's a demand for something, then somebody usually wants That something. Was there ever a time I read an article on our beloved IMDb with a title like: ""US cinema's can't wait for the next Almodovar picture to be screened"". Now movie remakes derive from the US, by not even checking somewhere if this is true I know it is, without a doubt, a fact. There are nations (I know of bigger European ones, like Germany, France, Spain, Italy), that for generations have been borough up by watching every single possible thing on TV dubbed into their language. Be it ""The Simpsons"" or ""Casablanca"", they put huge amounts of money into the industry of dubbing and the end result is these nations have poor knowledge of other languages. Except for Germans, who luckily share a language similar to the English language, this is a fact. American't take a different approach, they brand the stuff their way, ALL the way. Big bucks are put into making a movie that's already been done. All this because in the end, they were borough up by watching only American stuff, and because Hollywood likes to earn something as well.It's actually funny and disturbing at the same time thinking just how racist this discussion could become, if pursued on. But this is not my point at all, amidst the almost accusative comments I've made thus far I've almost lost hold of it. In short, if there's a good European movie made, an American version will follow. This is sad enough as it is. What's even sadder is that this is happening faster and faster. It's almost a crime, the makers of the original get some Hollywood money for the rights to the movie, and the price they pay is much greater. Instead of them taking credit for a well done movie, the Hollywood machine does.Why Chris Nolan decided to make a remake is beyond me. After a story like ""Memento""!!! There is nothing bad that can be said about his version apart from it being a remake. Which is more than enough. The only bright side of remakes, and you can quote me on this, is they make you discover good originals.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

An intense character study set against a psychological 'cat and mouse' game... that,"Christopher Nolan succeeds once again at mastering a suspenseful script into a truly superb film. Nolan (Memento) creates a complex and carefully construed tale that has plenty of intentional misdirection that is quite convincing.Al Pacino plays another one of his droopy detectives in a role that is quite unoriginal if placed in other films. Yet what separates this role from others is his portrayal of L.A. Detective Will Dormer actually has some 'meat' attached to it. Pacino plays a detective with a history of successful apprehensions, yet, he has flaws just like any other person and they come back to haunt him. Relocated from Los Angeles to Alaska, he is sent in hopes of capturing a killer who murdered a local schoolgirl.Judging from the previews, premature assumptions can be made labeling the film as another simple 'cat-and-mouse' thriller. Instead, those conceptions will be lost soon after the haunting opening credits emerge and we are transplanted directly into a deep and complex character study set against the backdrop of a local homicide mystery in a small Alaskan town. The film's antagonist (For those who have seen the film - is he really the villain or the catalyst for Pacino's ethical debate?) is a local writer portrayed by Robin Williams. This is Williams' second villainous role in his trilogy of films (Death to Smoochy, One Hour Photo) that aims at diversifying his resume. Williams impresses as he juxtaposes between an innocent victim of a mishap and between a calculating and conniving murderer.Director Nolan has assembled a terrific cast as this complex plot unfolds at a frivolous rate. This is a film that a discerning viewer will admire and a viewer with a short attention span will loathe. Nolan tosses us with one set of objectives and midway through the first act, we are sitting in on an entirely different film. Adjectives such as formulaic and conventional should not be associated with a film such as this. Nolan has completely revitalized the tired genre of the murder thriller with his sleek direction and picturesque photography.Nolan first had conceived of the idea upon viewing a Norwegian film of the same name directed by Erik Skjoldbjaerg. Nolan seems to have taken the flaws of the original and improved upon them in a sleek feat of filmmaking that leaves much to be questioned about its' brilliance. One viewing is not enough to internalize the level of sophistication Nolan has created with this brilliant film.Hillary Seitz's first attempt at writing a screenplay is solid but must be understood that the conception was not hers. Still, her script contains some juicy scenes that benefit all our characters in this film. Three Oscar winners (Pacino, Williams and Hillary Swank) highlight this film and with good reason. At first glance, the cast seems informingly incongruent, yet with time, all explains itself. Swank's performance as Detective Burr seems unnecessary right up until the final moments in the film. Yet, this is all of the resolute brilliance Nolan lends to this film.This film succeeds on several levels of cinematic bravura. David Julyan's haunting score coupled with intense subliminal flashes match the films' dark tone and Cinematographer Wally Pfister (Memento) captures the majestic beauty of the Alaskan sea front.As aforementioned, a thrilling chase of a murderer can be expected when introduced to the film. But not long after, we are delving into a debate that has a positive fix on morality. A battle between a person's conscience and his actions are truly at the forefront of this intellectually intriguing and complex thriller. Despite its' disappointing anticlimactic finale, the film still has enough zest and brilliance to make this film a true testament to the skill of Director Nolan.Giancarlo's Rating: ***",,Anonymous,Mystery
Al Pacino is so tired he can't sleep,"Two policemen, Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are sent in Alaska to make an investigation around the murder of a high school girl. Convinced that the murder was committed by a serial killer, Dormer decides to organize a police raid in an isolated house where seems to live the suspected murderer. But he (unintentionally?) kills his team mate. Fortunately, no-one saw him and because he doesn't want to be suspected, he gives a coherent reason about Eckhart's death which enables him to be saved. But the real murderer (Robin Williams) saw him killing Eckhart and starts to blackmail him.It is from this reversal of situation, the cop dominated by the killer, that ""Insomnia"" draws its originality. Here, several factors (that play in favor of Williams to the detriment of Pacino) explain this: Al Pacino's sickness: insomnia which prevents him from sleeping and especially the scenery where the action takes place, Alaska. An apparently peaceful land at least for its inhabitants but dreadful for foreigners, especially for Al Pacino. Indeed, the fact that it is always daylight only makes his sickness worse and makes him vulnerable in Williams' eyes. It is useful to add that Al Pacino is dazzling as an insomniac cop and the director Christopher Nolan emphasizes on his progressive weakening throughout the movie. On another hand, it is not a coincidence if his name is Dormer. It means ""sleeper"" in French so I think that only French people who watched this movie can appreciate the irony.With all that has been previously said, ""Insomnia"", according to me partly renews the detective movie. The result gives a solid and carefully constructed thriller. The sole shortcoming Christopher Nolan and his crew did is having hired Robin Williams to act the role of the killer. Throughout his career, he has been hired so many times in good roles and here, it is difficult to see him in the shoes of a criminal. Moreover, when he appears on the screen, the movie becomes quite talkative. These handicaps stop the movie from ranking among the greatest thrillers ever made but all the same, ""Insomnia"" constitutes a very good moment.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""I didn't murder her. I killed her, but it just ended up that way.""","FILM: 8.5/10.I recently rewatched the 2002 film Insomnia, and it's still a gripping and compelling experience. From the very beginning, the performances draw you in, and they are an absolute joy to watch. Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and Hilary Swank are all in top form, each player contributing equally to the film's success.Al Pacino's portrayal is a testament to his talent. He never digresses into overacting as he has in the past; instead, he plays his role with a subtle intensity that builds anticipation. His character is plagued by insomnia, which adds another layer of complexity to his performance. Pacino expertly captures the fatigue, frustration, and moral conflicts his character goes through.Robin Williams, known for his comedic roles, surprises us with a dark and disturbing character in this film. He's like a ticking time-bomb of undistilled rage and mounting frustration, just waiting to explode. Yet, for the majority of his screen time, Williams displays an almost creepy sense of control that sends chills down your spine. It's definitely one of the darkest and most poignantly disturbing roles he's ever done.The film weaves murder, mystery, and psychological tension together seamlessly, creating an enthralling narrative. Director Christopher Nolan, known for his ability to create mood, does a masterful job in Insomnia. The atmospheric cinematography by Wally Pfister and the hauntingly beautiful setting of Alaska enhance the sense of unease and isolation felt by the characters.The pacing is well-executed, keeping the tension high throughout. Every twist and turn in the plot is executed with precision, leaving you guessing until the very end. The psychological cat-and-mouse game between Pacino and Williams keeps you invested in their complex relationship.Overall, my rewatch of Insomnia was a great experience. The performances, the mix of murder, mystery, and psychological tension, and Nolan's masterful direction all contribute to its success. It's a film that stays with you long after the credits roll, and I highly recommend giving it a watch.FORMAT: Blu-rayVIDEO: 8/10.1080p presentation, Detail level: Good, Colour reproduction: Excellent, Level accuracy: Excellent, Encode: Good, Master condition: GoodAUDIO: 9/10.DTS HD-MA 5.1 audio, Dialogue reproduction: Excellent, Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent, Dynamics: Excellent, Surround sound presentation: Good, LFE content: GoodMOOFIEMETER: 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Al Pacino's terrific acting as a detective carrying out a twisted and complex enquiry,"Riveting and interesting thriller with brilliant performances. Two Los Angeles homicide detectives Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are dispatched to a northern town where the sun doesn't set to investigate the methodical murder of a local teen. To Ellie (Hilary Swank) the rookie assigned to assist the detective Dormer's a hero. But she doesn't knows Dorner is investigated by Internal Affairs. Poor Dormer,however, he's really disoriented in every scene, no longer distinguishes so clearly between means and motive, cause and effect. He who sins, does not sleep ! .Days never end. Nightmares are real. No one is innocent. Don't close your eyes. A tough cop. A brilliant killer. An unspeakable crime. A murder investigator has been brought in on a special case, sleep deprived, he makes a horrible mistake which is discovered by the killer he has been hunting !.This taut psychological thriller contains intrigue, action, shootouts , suspense, twists and turns. If all this may sound familiar, it's because Hillary Seitz's subtle script improves on the 1997 Norwegian thriller of the same name: Insomnia by Erik Skjoldbjærg with Stellan Skarsgård, Sverre Anker Ousdal, Gisken Armand. Concerning a twisted premise: when a killing takes place and covers it up, a double sided game of cat-and-mouse ensues. Despite its linear script, the movie is very recognisable the work of the sharp, probing intelligence that gave ¨Following¨ and ¨Memento¨. You'll be pleasantly surprised by the unconventional progression of the storyline and the various twists within the script. While it succeeds as an extremely stylish, gripping thriller, it's also another of the director's takes on life as narrative. Uniformly excellent performance especially from Al Pacino and Robin Williams , lends welcome nuance and depth to the ethical investigation while furnishing the drama with dark, telling ironies and intriguing ambiguity. There are few actors as Pacino who can keep a straight face, yet still manage to convey complex emotion, and he is one of them. He walked through his scenes with somberness and really powerful, yet weary. Pacino and Williams are well accompanied by a magnificent support cast, such as: Hilary Swank, Paul Dooley, Nicky Katt, Maura Tierney, Jonathan Jackson, Katharine Isabelle Larry Holden, Jay Brazeau, Lorne Cardinal, Ian Tracey, among others.It displays thrilling and suspenseful musical score by David Julyan .

Rage Against the Dying of the Light,"""Invited to 'Nightmute', Alaska, to head a murder case, veteran LAPD detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) finds his investigation interrupted by an ever-shining midnight sun that wreaks sleep-depriving havoc on him - and by personal guilt over a second crime that may be real or a figment of his increasingly unstable consciousness,"" according to the DVD sleeve description.Director Christopher Nolan does an excellent job crafting a North American version of the original 1997 Norwegian crime drama, helped immensely by Hillary Seitz' intricate, intelligent adaptation.Also extraordinary are Mr. Pacino, cinematographer Wally Pfister, and editor Dody Dorn. Hilary Swank and Robin Williams effectively tone down their established personas. The smaller roles are beautifully realized - Paul Dooley, Larry Holden, Katharine Isabelle, Jonathan Jackson, Nicky Katt, and Maura Tierney deserve an ""ensemble cast"" award - and, Martin Donovan's ""Hap"" is particularly haunting.This film could have easily been nominated for six ""Academy Awards"" - but, probably, voters were sleepless in Chicago. Nevertheless, ""Insomnia"" shows Mr. Nolan, coming off ""Memento"" (2000), moving into the circle of upper echelon directors. Mr. Pfister knows how to hand-hold cameras, and Ms. Dorn's editing skills are sharp - hopefully, this team will receive some more film projects.********* Insomnia (5/3/02) Christopher Nolan ~ Al Pacino, Robin Williams, Hilary Swank, Martin Donovan",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Atmospheric thriller. Robin Williams does a great bad guy,"A good thriller this one, atmospheric, taught and keeps you guessing. I sure do like Robin Williams in these roles as the bad guy, (also check out One Hour Photo) he is so good, creepy in an understated way. Al Pacino gives a great performance here too, conflicted, stressed and slowly unraveling from lack of sleep. I think his character stays awake for 6 days and it was fascinating to watch him try to cover his expanding pack of lies while going crazy. (Director) Nolan sure likes to torture his leads in unique ways.Insomnia takes place in a remote Alaskan town where, because its summer the sun doesn't set. Two Los Angeles detectives are dispatched there to investigate the homicide of a young girl (why, I'm not sure). Hilary Swank plays an impressionable young officer who meets their seaplane -I liked her here, trying to impress Al Pacino as the folklorish cop hero.While apprehending the suspect Al accidentally (?) shoots his partner and then covers it up, giving the lurking Robin Williams killer character blackmail ammunition against him. These two have some great scenes together, cat and mousing their way through the second half.The scenery is beautiful here, unique especially if you don't know better as I found myself distracted at times by Squamish (B.C) posing as Alaska with shots of the Chief, the mill, Chieftain pub, Britannia beach etc. A good thriller. 2/9/15",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"One of the better film's out there, but not up to Nolan's incredibly high standards","I'm one of Christopher Nolan's biggest fans. I think he was best filmmaker in the past decade, and if he continues making highly innovative,different,engrossing and intense films like memento,Batman Begins,TDK and now Inception, he's going to have a claim to be one of the greatest directors of all time. He's certainly on his way there. This film is by no means lacking in creativity, but when you look at Nolan's other works, this is no doubt the odd one out, there is genre subversion with the classic dark noir scenes replaced by omnipresent sunlight. The plot is good,but not great. What really draws you in is Al Pacino showing his greatness as an actor with a brilliant rendition of William Dommer,the title character .A cat-and-mouse game between hero-cop-with- skeletons-in-his-closet-suffering-from-insomnia-and-guilt and criminal- with-ace-up-his-sleeve is intriguing and engaging. But so,Robin William's appearance somehow hurts the movie, who,despite his talent,gives an unusually lackluster performance. The movie then loses its pace and intensity,and I found my attention wandering,something I thought impossible during a Nolan Movie. The 24-day concept is new and refreshing,Hillary Swank also gives a solid performance. The first 1 hour was very promising.Yet, somewhere in between, the movie loses its intensity, and already lacking Nolan's characteristic incredibly out-of-the-box-theme, it also loses its chance at greatness. Despite that,it's not a bad movie by any stretch. It's definitely worth a watch. Catch it for another stellar performance from one of Hollywood's stalwarts and Nolan's clever cinematography.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
No time for Sleeping,"Right from the opening credits the mood of quiet tension never lets up. The strong contrast between the icy landscape and blood leaking all over a material isn't there just to be a cool visual. We see our protagonist Will Dormer, a weary detective whose face looks burdened by the troubles that follow him. An insomniac, hunted by internal affairs for his suspect methods and now sent to investigate a murder in a remote town where the sun never sets. It's a question of how long before he snaps.Pacino is on top form in the type of role he's always excelled in. Tough and experienced after years in the job, but emotionally vulnerable and perpetually on the edge for exactly the same reason. His younger partner Eckhart is willing to dish out information on him. The turning point comes when a trap set for the killer goes wrong and Dormer kills Eckhart after mistaking him in the fog. There's no doubting that it was an accident, but Dormer knows that with the case against him he has no chance of making such a claim. He manages to just about suppress his guilt and concoct a story that lets him off clean. There's one major problem for him however, the killer knows that he did it.Insomnia isn't just a moody title, it's a reflection of Dormer's mind-set as a whole. How a man's mental state has become so damaged that his morality and ethics have become blurred. It questions how far he's willing to go to do what he knows is right deep down, even if it goes against the very principles he's lived by his entire life. The permanent daylight of Alaska serves to highlight his insomnia in a visual sense, bringing it to forefront so there's no place for him to hide. Too often films of this ilk try to add some kind of quirk or motif without giving it a reasoning or representation. But it's something that is handled impressively here.Bar Pacino, two performances really standout. The first being Hilary Swank as the plucky Ellie Burr, a role she plays to perfection. She never goes for the typical rookie cop trying to impress, she instead plays it audacious but collected, someone who wants to do the right thing but understands the difficulties that come with the job. The second is Robin Williams as the killer Finch. It never ceases to amaze me how someone so funny can reach such depths and play such disturbed characters. It's comparable to his part in 'One Hour Photo', released the same year. He takes an understated approach, making Finch more unnerving than raving and it works in give the role an edge.The relationship between Dormer and Finch actually turns out to be one of the highlights. We very rarely get a thriller that makes such a valid connection between the hero and villain. It is clear that the two of them share the same psychological problems. Insomnia haunts their every step. Notably their both trying to achieve the same thing, clearing their names. Finch wants to people to think he's innocent and Dormer wants to pin Eckhart's death on anyone but himself. Their relationship is fascinating for how manipulative it is. Both latch on to each other despite appearing to be polar opposites because they need to work together to survive.There are a couple of occasions where things can happen a little too conveniently or the plot ties together too neatly. Some of the action sequences feel a little out of place given the tone, though the chase across the logs is handled excellently. Nolan's reliance on the bigger picture can sometimes lead to the little details being forgotten about or hastily connected. However the story itself is a nice antidote to his previous film 'Memento'. While that film was chained so tightly to its gimmick that there was no room for anything to breathe or develop, Insomnia is much sparser and atmospheric. More interested in building tension through fog and isolation. It allows the characters to soak up the ghostly settings and for that to play into their psychology.Why the film drew Nolan's attention is obvious. It plays on themes that he finds interesting, mainly the troubled morality of the central character. Whereas most thrillers are interested in the details of the investigation and the crime, Insomnia makes a wise choice to instead examine the mind-set of Dormer and how he is distressed by his choices. The brightness proves a crucial aspect. Despite the murky underside of the case, the light is always on Dormer. He has nowhere to hide his feelings, even sleep has rejected him.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not a very good movie,"If you suffer from insomnia be sure and see this one - -it will put you to sleep. It was a real letdown for me. I had expected from all the hype to see a tense or suspense filled drama, it was neither. It started to go downhill for me from the very first. That the L.A. police Dept. would send two of their best detectives to Alaska to help with a murder case that was totally unrelated to them or L.A. is not creditable. I feel that neither the director or screenwriter knows too much about actual police work as there were other things (e.g. running red lights and sirens blaring to serve a search warrant)that didn't make sense. Puchino & Swank did as well as could be expected with the material they had to work with. Robin William's character wasn't really believable.

Nothing like Al Pacino on no sleep,"I was having trouble getting to sleep the other night and this came up on cable, I may have missed the first couple of minutes but I think I got the gist as it went along. Al and his homicide squad partner come up from LA (where their unit is under investigation) and assist Alaskan police on a murder case in mid-summer. Al never quite adjusts to the 24 hour sunlight but that's only one of his many issues. Swank does really well as the local smart, hard-working and appreciative help. Al gives a nice textured performance, everyone sort of has shades of this or that in this movie, as things progress we learn a little more about the characters and what led to the murder. At points Al's eccentric behavior may test credibility but the story moved along well, this is a serviceable cop drama.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Well built thriller with a less than stellar ending,"It's weird watching this in the middle of watching Twin Peaks. Both are about out of town lawmen coming to an out of the way small town in the heavily wooded parts of the American northwest to investigate the murder of a high school girl whose body had been dumped, naked, in plastic bags. The lawmen stay at lodges, and there's even a use of the name Leland. Based on the Norwegian movie of the same name, Christopher Nolan's Insomnia, at some level, feels like the more literal version of David Lynch's surrealistic exploration of a murder. But enough about that, how's the movie?Al Pacino is Will Dormer, a soon to be disgraced Los Angeles robbery-homicide detective who's been sent to Alaska to help the local police department investigate the murder of Kay Connell. With him is his partner, Hap, who is considering cutting a deal with Internal Affairs that will throw Will under the bus but save his own skin. Will, convinced that if they just maintain a strong front, is disgusted and disappointed in his partner's willingness to give in. With the local police, they find Kay's backpack and let out a message to the community that leads the killer to try and reclaim it at a remote cabin in a rocky and foggy location outside of town. In the confusion, Will accidentally shoots and kills Hap who dies convinced that Will did it on purpose, and the killer witnessed it all.The movie gets its title from the fact that the remote Alaskan town of Nightmute is above the Arctic Circle and has no nighttime that season and Will cannot get any sleep in his well-lit hotel room at the local lodge. That he cannot sleep means that he cannot forget the pressure he is under back home, the guilt he feels for shooting Hap, and that he's being squeezed by the Kay's killer, the local author Walter Finch, played by Robin Williams. This feeling is sold cinematically through over-exposed images, cross-cutting to previous moments, and blurring sound design as Pacino's performance because more and more strung out. He often looks, in the latter parts of the film, to be struggling to simply keep his eyes open and focus.All of this is solid stuff. Pacino is good. Williams is understated and creepy as Finch. Hillary Swank is eager as the young Detective Ellie who gets tasked with writing the report on Hap's shooting. Everything is cleanly filmed in a professional manner, and the sequence in the fog is just the right combination of clear and murky to give us solid perspective into a hard to discern situation. The appearance of Williams provides an interesting level of menace, and Pacino's increasing desperation as he loses more and more control of the situation is played really well.I suppose the only thing holding me back from appreciating this film more is the ending. It's not that I don't like to see flawed protagonists relearn the correct values. It's that I'm not sure I buy Will Dormer following through to the end. You see, Dormer, at a certain point, gives up on getting out clean with any hope of also getting Finch held responsible for Kay's murder. So, he drives to Finch's cabin in the middle of the country to kill him with Ellie having coincidentally gone at the same time to collect a piece of evidence for the Kay murder, Finch having come forward at Dormer's insistence because there was no hiding the fact that Finch and Kay had a previous connection. Finch, the very careful murderer, accidentally leaves out the dress Kay was in when he murdered her, leading Ellie to figure out in a split second that he did it, even though, as far as we know, the police never knew what dress Kay had been wearing and it was well known that Finch had bought the girl clothes. The meat of the final confrontation is built around this realization that feels thin at best. So, Dormer has to save Ellie, who's also figured out that Dormer did in fact shoot Hap in a solid piece of movie detective work, kill Finch, and, as he lays dying due to a shotgun blast from Finch, insists on Ellie letting the truth out about Hap's death.Now, I've seen the original film, and it ends very different with the Dormer analogue getting away clean. That's not necessarily what I want from this American version, though. My criticism isn't because this takes a nicer route than it's progenitor, but that it's a combination of too convenient, too thin, and too clean. Ellie being there at the same time feels almost like a distraction. Ellie figuring out that Finch is the killer feels too easy. Dormer wanting to just kill Finch feels like the right move for his character, but using his dying breath to accept responsibility feels like a step too far. There's nothing really wrong with this ending, but I suspect there's a superior, more interesting on in a previous draft of the script.Overall Insomnia is a finely crafted thriller with a strong central character at its core. It's the sort of thing one might expect from an up and coming director given a decent budget in order to try and prove himself. The personalities involved in front of the camera were probably too strong for the young Brit to fully control, so he corralled them effectively. He made something safe to prove that he could operate in the system, reminding me a bit of Orson Welles' The Stranger, though Nolan and Welles would go on to have vastly different careers.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Zzzzz...,"You know that feeling a movie gives you at the end?  This one definitely had it.  Not because it was great, but because IT WAS OVER!  Robin Williams and Al Pacino played their roles perfectly, however, the story left me wanting, wondering If and hoping there was some kind of moral.

A Masterful Crime Thriller Enriched by Psychological Complexity,"With 'Insomnia', Christopher Nolan ventures into the realm of the traditional crime thriller, yet his unique directorial touch is evident throughout. The film is a suspenseful ride packed with unexpected twists, with an underlying psychological complexity that elevates it beyond a typical genre piece.Al Pacino delivers a remarkable performance as Detective Will Dormer, effectively capturing the moral ambiguity and sleep-deprived paranoia of his character. His nuanced portrayal enhances the impact of the film's exploration of guilt and redemption.Nolan's atmospheric direction shines, as he beautifully exploits the gloomy, ever-bright Alaskan setting to accentuate the protagonist's disoriented state. The tight script maintains the tension while ensuring a steady reveal of the plot's layers.In essence, 'Insomnia' is a testament to Nolan's ability to deliver a gripping narrative with depth, intensity, and a keen eye for character development. Though different from his more puzzle-like narratives, it is a compelling piece in Nolan's directorial repertoire.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An awesome detective thriller with great directing and acting,"Christopher Nolan takes on a noir detective story with a unique location. Detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) arrives in Alaska, tired but ready to work. He and his partner Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are greeted by local policewoman Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank). The Los Angeles detectives are investigating the murder of a young high school girl Kay Connell (Crystal Low) but Dormer is disoriented by the daylight in the middle of the night. They stay at a hotel run by Rachel Clement (Maura Tierney). Hap is being investigated by Internal Affairs and is thinking of confessing which would incriminate Will. The next morning on little sleep, Will and Hap head to the high school to interrogate Kay's boyfriend Randy Stetz (Jonathan Jackson) who is uncooperative during the questioning. He does admit that Kay was seeing someone else but he doesn't know who it is.Will treats Ellie as a protégé schooling her on the procedure and the little things of an investigation. When Kay's bookbag is found in a cabin, it provides clues and a trap for Will to devise. Dormer continues to threat over the IA investigation, doubting his own tactics. When the amateur Alaskan police botch the stakeout alerting the suspect, a foot chase ensues through the cabin and fog. A policeman is shot but Will Dormer pursues the suspect across slick rocks and fires into the mist possibly shooting and killing his partner Hap. Overcome with grief, Will is unable to sleep and keeps reflecting back on his previous shortcuts he took to nab awful criminals. He works to cover up the possibility that he shot his partner as he becomes increasingly dazed. Noises disturb him and he hallucinates his partner giving him accusatory looks. The killer calls him up on the phone and reveals that he knows of Will's guilt in killing his partner. Ellie suspects that something isn't quite right with Will's account of his partner's shooting. Will confront Tanya Francke (Katharine Isabelle) taking her to the dump where Kay's body was dumped after spooking her by playing chicken with a truck. Tanya mentions Kay's secret lover who promised the young victim all sorts of things. The killer calls him again at the station taunting him about what he knows and Will offers to meet him. He deciphers the clues and heads to the house of Walter Finch (Robin Williams), a mystery novel author.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Best cop movie I've seen in the last 12 years,"When you have three Academy Award Winners in one picture, it's destined to be terrific or downright terrible. This movie is terrific. The funny thing is I didn't realize how good it was until about four years later. Time has a way of blurring your memory and mine is more blurred than most. You can't forget this one however because it sticks in your head and won't come out. The cinematography is superb and the lines are, in several places, quite unique and memorable. I will always remember at the end, feeling Dormer's (Pacino) insomnia. Literally feeling it. And obviously, I've been there. I once went eight whole days without a night's sleep. Don't ask me how, but I did. And after that much sleeplessness, it begins to mess with you. I have only seen about ten minutes of the original film on which this film is based, not because I got bored and turned it off, but because I didn't realize what I was watching. If I had, I most certainly would have watched the whole thing. Robin Williams was an illogical but certainly credible, deserved, and welcome addition to this film, and anyone who says he plays something other than what he actually plays didn't pay close attention. He is always good for an unexpected performance. Do yourself a favor, study this film. Really study it. A true work of art if there ever was one on film.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Will is conflicted with different things and after shooting and killing his partner that may or may not have been an accident he finds it hard to get a clear head and to sleep in a town that seems to be stuck in constant day light.

Insomnia,"Insomnia, an excellent detective mystery drama that has enough layers and turns to keep you engaged, though never really hitting the home run, it's a extremely solid movie that grabs hold and doesn't let go.Directing, not having seen much of Nolan's early work yet this is obviously much smaller scale, a has a stronger focus on characters. And by no means does that mean a weaker movie, it's a really easy movie to watch. A good story, well acted, great music, and also really well paced. The creative stuff done with the whole insomnia aspect were great additions to, and also helped with pacing. I did expect it to ramp up more towards the end but it does kind of hang in that aspect. It doesn't play into the story enough in my opinion. Besides that the movie looks fantastic, for an era, 2002, where movie could really look ... grungy. This is the opposite, very well directed as we can expect by now.Writing and story. I love the dynamic between the two leads here, and it's what makes this whole movie a lot more interesting. Besides the fact the cast is stacked so there's no problem there either. The writing is great and for me came to a satisfying conclusion. Some nitpicks here, like the scene with the hotel manager at the end, why is she sleeping in his bed? I get what it suggest, but it felt totally misplaced. There was zero connection for that to happen.Acting, fantastic. Pacino is great, Williams steals every scene especially in these sort of roles, the tenderness and mysterious depth, excellent. Everyone else good too.Music, audio, though teetering on generic it is a good score, but mostly it carries the movie's pace incredibly well. The subtleties are really good. Sound design, wow those gunshots are loud, be prepared. Adds to the impact for sure. Also the sound design for the insomnia effects are great too. If you've ever been without sleep for too long, it's immediately recognizable.Very enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Great overall - Lacks convincing the impact and relevance of the insomnia,"Really compelling story, with multiple plots closing in on each other as the movie progresses. It has a overarching theme and message perfectly fitting the characters, making them believable and likeable despite their flaws. The acting is convincing, the dialogue however is less so.The main issue is certainly the pacing, as it feels very drawn out, especially expressing the issue central to the movie - insomnia. However, the doubt that was attempted to be caused as a result of it did not come across well and was not at all convincing. This could have made a significant impact on how the movie and what the protagonist sees would have been interpreted.

Terrific thriller,"Insomnia is a terrific thriller with a really smart idea of a bleak mystery and spiral into corruption set against constant daylight that prevents anything being hidden. It's definitely one of the best remakes of a European film that's a lot less bleak than the original whilst still bringing plenty of moral greys.Al Pacino and Robin Williams are the pillars of this film and both play against type to great effect. Al Pacino has a few well placed moments of his loud rage but for the most part remains increasingly tired whilst still clearly giving it all. Robin Williams dials down the manic energy completely for a much quieter and unnerving performance.Christopher Nolan's direction is really impressive, going from micro to mid budget pretty flawlessly a way few filmmakers get the chance to these days.

The killing may or may not be accidental and we are now thrust into the detective's guilt trip over the circumstances and his implausible 'strange bedfellow' agreement with the young woman's killer.

A dark ride in the subconscious,"Following up a movie like Memento must be quite a chore, but Christopher Nolan did his best. Insomnia is more of a focus on photographic technicalities, allowing the more mainstream viewer to experience Nolan's dark and cryptic style of focusing and cutting. But then again, Insomnia isn't just about cinematography, it's about the nature of human beings and their passion for the truth. Al Pacino portrays the troubled cop Will Dormer to a hilt, letting his natural wrinkles and facial expressions become a natural prosthetic. While the dialogue was simple and direct, the entire history of the characters could be told in the first few minutes of the film. Hillary Swank and Robin Williams' characters had very little history or motive, but then again, their stories are not as important as Dormer's. However, such a miscue in storytelling leaves a hollowness to the picture, turning everyone into a fickle backdrop for Dormer's troubles. Overall, the story was well put together, and executed by the numbers. While David Julyan's score was good, he should have sought to stay confined within his bounds as he did with Memento and Following. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Very good psychological murder film,"This was a difficult one to find to watch in Australia. Christopher Nolan has made many of my favourite films and Pacino is one of my favourite actors so I keenly wanted to give this a watch. And he's brilliant, Detective Hanna in Heat is one of my favourite film characters of all time, so to see him as a detective again (albeit a less frenetic, less energetic and more beaten down one) was my highlight as are all the actors in this film.The setting of no night and all day is really interesting and utilised here, with streets busy during the ""day"" and quite during the late hours but still well lit. Morally it raises interesting questions, and thankfully unlike some films by the end it satisfactorily answers them. A great score too.The only reason it does not get higher is because it's still a crime film, set in northern America which isn't too different (besides the big names) from a midday thriller, even if it's a way above average one.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sleep Will be the Last Thing on Your Mind,"Christopher Nolan wasn't always directing caped crusaders and dreamworld desperadoes. Once upon a time (nine years ago to be exact) he was at the helm of a criminally underrated crime thriller by the name of Insomnia.Starring Al Pacino as a L.A. detective who travels to a remote Alaskan town to help identify the killer of a teen, this is one of Pacino's most recently truly great performances (a shame, I know). Hilary Swank and Robin Williams co-star as an up-and-coming local policewoman and deranged author (respectively), and both do a superb job of keeping pace with the venerable titan of Tinseltown.What's particularly effective here is the excellent use of setting. In Nightmute (sounds inviting, huh?), because of its far-northern location, the sun doesn't set for long periods of time. This causes Detective Dormer (Pacino) to eventually start falling apart at the seams, as the sun seems to penetrate every effort he makes to lose himself in restful slumber. This naturally ties into a specific subtext that reveals much about Dormer's personality and tainted past as a detective, and it's very refreshing to see the usual them of darkness giving way to light flipped on its head.The problem with writing a review of Insomnia is that I can't detail too much about what unfolds (in terms of plot) without ruining some of the major twists that lend genuine weight to the story as it ambles along some truly dark and disturbing corridors. Don't let the analogy fool you, though; there's nothing slow about the pacing, and it's wholly engrossing from start to finish. The sense of impending slumber is imminent, though, and this heightens the tension in the third act when ""truth"" starts to become a relative term for our exhausted protagonist.Insomnia isn't nearly as stylish as Nolan's most recent offerings, but it's certainly ably directed and its tale is spun with maximum efficiency. If, for one reason or another, this gem that originally shone almost a decade ago has eluded your radar, be sure to check it out.As for myself, it's time to get a little shut-eye.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Insomnia (1997) v.s. Insomnia (2002),"First I watched Insomnia in theatre and I thought that it was great movie. Two days later I saw on TV Guide that Insomnia was on TV.  I searched IMDB and found out that the Insomnia (2002) is actually a remake of a Norwegian film by the same name Insomnia (1997).So I watched the movie on TV and I noticed that the plot was a somewhat altered.  One would assume that a remake would be a better with a budget of 50million and enormous star power, but that's not the case here.   I expected more from `Christopher Nolan, the creator of Memento'.I think the reason the remake is not as good is because they changed the characters to make Al Pacino and even Robin William (the bad guy) look better. They never wanted to make a better film; they wanted to manufacture a movie that would make millions and millions of dollars, like most of the movies that are made in the Hollywood today.The acting was okay and Christopher Nolan's directing of the movie was excellent, but overall I believe that the original Insomnia was much better.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Insomnia: Flawed But Acceptable Remake,"As mentioned in my review of this film's 1997 Norwegian parent, of late I am deeply interested in the similarities and differences between foreign language films and their American remakes. With a fondness for both Scandinavian cinema and Al Pacino, the Insomnias were an obvious case to investigate.Remaining faithful to its forebear in terms of the main plot, Insomnia gives us Detective Will Dormer, assigned to the investigation of a 17 year old girl's murder. Amidst difficulty adjusting to the midnight sun of Alaska, an unfortunate accident forces him to lie about his actions. He becomes haunted by both his guilt and the threatening musings of the girl's murderer, who knows the truth.An interesting opening credits sequence combines images of a bloodstained fabric with the beautiful Alaskan setting this remake calls home. A fair answer to the original's setting, the remote wilderness offers incredible scenery, its iciness as entrancingly mysterious as the unexplained sanguine fibres. The first and most noticeable difference to set this apart from its Norwegian counterpart is the female detective, played here by Hilary Swank. Despite Swank's entirely likable performance, one cannot help but lament this change of direction. The original character's austerity was her strength; the alternative's naivety her weakness. The mentor-student dynamic which forms between Pacino and she is, while unique and understandable, far less effective than the tension of the original relationship. Due to a combination of the newly introduced IA subplot, the dropping of the retirement age and concomitant hearing problems of the main detective's partner, and the lack of an American gun ban, Dormer's ""accident"" and whether it is indeed that becomes more the focus of attention than the guilt of Engström's. Additionally, the original's heavy usage of insomnia in a metaphorical sense is largely replaced here by its physical effects. More realistic? Probably. More effective? Absolutely not. It only really comes into play in the finale, an action filled Hollywood shootout that drags a flawed but acceptable remake down in its last act. Pacino's latter-day madness is on full display here, much different to Skarsgård and, much as I love Al, a less compelling performance. Now Williams, however, takes his part and flies with it, bringing something new and creative to his adaptation: one of disappointingly few improvements upon the original film. An intoxicatingly interesting point to be made is that the dead dog into which Dormer shoots his decoy bullet replaces a live one shot by Engström: a fascinating difference which speaks volumes, both about the difference in characterisation and the allowances and tolerances of the respective film industries.As a remake, Insomnia is certainly poorer than its source, replacing some key plot points with less effective ones and adding an ending which is as trashy as the one it replaces is superb. Standing alone as its own work, it mostly manages to present its ideas decently and entertainingly, crafting a film better than much of the other schlock that gets churned out. If only we lived in a better world, the budget of this could have gone to distributing the original. C'est la vie, alas...",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Once again an awful Hollywood remake of a brilliant European thriller!,"The original (Norwegian) version of Insomnia really impressed me, and was one of the most interesting twists on the standard cop-solves-murder formula I've seen for years. I really tried to keep an open mind about this remake, putting aside the examples of the lousy Hollywood remakes of brilliant European thrillers 'Spoorloos' ('The Vanishing') and 'Nattevagten' ('Nightwatch'), and saying to myself ""this time it's Christopher Nolan, it's gonna work out fine!"" ('Memento' is one of my favourite movies of the last ten years). Even a quick glance at the DVD cover and the phrase ""cat and mouse game"" jumping out didn't deter me. But after the opening scenes of the movie, noting that the cop (Pacino)'s partner (Martin Donovan) was considerably younger not older as in the original, hearing all the internal affairs sub-plot, I started to get a bad feeling. And then, after a crucial plot point I won't reveal for those who have yet to see the movie, there's a scene involving a dog... well as soon as that happened my heart sank and I said ""oh, I see what they're going to do. I know EXACTLY where they're going to take this"". Then the movie, much to my dismay, continued along it's cliched way, and every single thing that made the original so fresh and fascinating was thrown out the window! If you haven't seen the original you just won't know what you're missing, but believe me, it is so much better than this! It wasn't just the plot alterations and the expanding/changing of certain characters that ruined this movie for me, I also though Pacino's performance was lousy. I defy anyone to say that he is even CLOSE to the level of Stellan Skarsgard's superb performance in the original movie. I believed Skarsgard's character, I didn't believe Pacino's. I really don't know why Christopher Nolan would agree to direct a movie with such an awful, cliched script when 'Memento' showed he is capable of writing much more original and exciting scripts himself. 'Insomnia' is yet another example of an awful Hollywood remake of a superior European thriller. Please try and see the original, it is ten times better than this!",,Anonymous,Mystery
Great but not at the same caliber as most Nolan films,"Here's another great work by the masterful auteur that is Christopher Nolan. Insomnia is about two cops who go to a small town in Alaska to investigate the murder of a teenage girl. While chasing a suspect officer Will Dormer (Al Pacino) accidentally shoots and kills his partner Hap (Martin Donavan). Distraught at what this could do to his already dwindling reputation, which is explained in some very important back story, Dormer lies about the accident and tells everybody that it was the man they were chasing that shot Hap. This event leads to a dark series of twists and turns that go deep into the psychological nature of an emotionally provoked cop and a psychopathic killer.Insomnia is a very dark film, yet only in figurative terms. The film is never physically dark and this is for an extremely important reason that is also where the title of the film stems from. It takes place in an Alaskan town far up north and in many places like that it never gets dark for certain periods of the year. Dormer, a cop from Los Angeles, is investigating this murder during one of those periods. Because of the complete lack of darkness Dormer develops sleep problems and is hit hard by insomnia. It is this that spurs on a thrilling chain of events that lead up to an incredible climax that comes very unexpectedly. This setting creates for a compelling juxtaposition of psychological themes that branch out towards the sleep depraved nether regions of the human mind, to the dark and twisted mind of an unconventional killer, who Robin Williams portrays with absolute disturbing perfection. Robin Williams, despite being as hilarious as he is, always amazes in his more serious roles and Insomnia is a fantastic exposè of his dramatic talent.Dark and brooding films are not something that are far and few between in this day and age of cynicism, yet Insomnia is able to stand out as one of the better portrayals of the dark side of the human mind. And not only is Insomnia a good example of a dark thriller, it is just an all around well made film. Pacino and Williams are incredible together and their counteracting roles balance each other out in such an immaculate and harrowing way. They are both given a fantastic script to work off of that weaves a captivating story that will leave you thinking, while also entertained. And of course it is a Christopher Nolan film so the stylistic direction is of course great. The jumpy and claustrophobic way in which it is shot provides a fuller experience of the psychological thriller story. Nolan keeps the technical grandeur toned down greatly for this picture, but his visual stamp is still there.My only real complaint with this film is that it is not as big as what you would expect from a Nolan film. It is much smaller in scale and doesn't blow your mind out of proportion like his other films do. However, this is hardly a legitimate complaint because an individual movies quality should not be compared alongside another. Each film is its own and should be critiqued as such. Thus saying that Insomnia lacks the pizzaz of other Nolan films is not so much a criticism so much as a personal observation.Insomnia is a great addition to the psychological thriller genre. Its a great story that keeps you wanting more and Pacino and Williams absolutely amaze. Don't expect anything huge but definitely check this one out for visual and psychological aesthetic.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Finally I could see a good thriller,"Some days ago Woody Allen came to Spain to receive the prestigious Príncipe de Asturias Award, and he had time to express his personal opinion about Hollywood today. His recent film Hollywood Ending is a clear critic of what Hollywood has become. I have to say that I agree with him. Films are more and more expensive, but the results are worse and worse. It seems like there are no good writers yet, and films like The Red Dragon (which I saw today in its Spanish première) are -in my modest opinion, of course- a demonstration on how empty of ideas a film can be. But Insomnia is an exception among dozens of low quality films. It has a really good screenplay, with very good original ideas, and, also, the printed result is great. Al Pacino is splendid (does he overact a bit or is it just my imagination? Maybe it's only my imagination). Robin Williams is correct, he does his role well (it's his second bad guy role in just a few months) and the rest of the cast are also quite good. The opening scene is simply captivating. And the edition of the whole film is wonderful. It's a pleasure to see the first minutes of Pacino's scenes, full of short shots perfectly combined with plenty of subtle details. I enjoyed the whole film since it began until it ended. Nice story, perfect screenplay, solid acting, good music, wonderful cinematography and editing and good directing. A really good film.

"Chris Nolan, Al Pacino and Robin Williams - I couldn't ask for more","Despite being one of the lowest rated films by Nolan, it remains my personal favorite.Christopher Nolan's direction in ""Insomnia"" is tense and atmospheric, emphasizing the isolated and haunting Alaskan setting. His direction maintains a sense of ambiguity and moral complexity, blurring the lines between right and wrong, and presenting morally compromised characters.Al Pacino delivers a strong and compelling performance as Detective Will Dormer. Pacino effectively conveys the character's internal turmoil, guilt, and exhaustion, adding depth and complexity to the role.Robin Williams departs from his typical comedic roles to portray Walter Finch, the enigmatic and sinister suspect. Williams showcases his versatility as an actor, delivering a chilling and nuanced performance that adds a layer of psychological intrigue to the film.""Insomnia"" delves into themes of guilt, deception, the consequences of one's actions, and the fragility of the human mind under extreme circumstances. The film explores the psychological toll of insomnia, blurring the lines between reality and hallucination.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Al Pacino battles Robin Williams and no sleep,"Sumptuous scenery and a fresh, enthusiastic Hillary Swank are in sharp contrast to weary Al Pacino in ""Insomnia,"" about a legendary LA homicide investigator who goes to Alaska to assist in finding a killer. In the land of the midnight sun, Pacino finds there's no rest from his demons.This is a slow-moving film at times, though the performances are very good. Pacino makes one tired just to look at him. As the film goes on, and he's had no sleep due to the constant light, his voice becomes raspy, his eyes are nearly shut, and he looks stupefied. He plays a complicated man, hounded by a departmental investigation and now a blackmailing killer. Like many of his other characterizations, Pacino gives us many layers of an imperfect man. Hillary Swank is very good, though wasted in a role that doesn't give her much to do except be young. Robin Williams, as a mystery author, turns in an excellent performance. Former General Hospital actor Jonathan Jackson has a small part as the victim's boyfriend. Jackson is very much a chameleon, playing a bad boy as if he was born to it.This was probably a disappointment in a movie theater at $10 a shot; it's perhaps more interesting as a rental or on television.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Christopher Nolan at his Best,"Director Chistopher Nolan is the acclaimed director of Memento one other of his great films that he has done, and then he scores again with this beautiful well-made thriller, I was intrigued from start to finish, Nolan uses of lighting, and darkness to give just a wonderful scenario an tone of the movie. Al Pacino was great Robin Williams is just a scary person in this film and shows his dark side and that's what Nolan does to his actors. This is simply one of the best psychological thrillers that I have seen hands down to Nolan.

I give "" Insomnia"" a 9 out of 10 Stars.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Neither Nolan..Nor Pacino,"I had great expectations from Nolan and Pacino collaboration but those were never even acknowledged, let alone met by Insomnia. The film is neither a Pacino drama, nor a Nolan brainy thriller and in fact the props like insomnia and the Alaskan landscapes rather than the story itself, are what make the film bearable. Pacino, as we all know has got bigger teeth, but Nolan does not give him much to dig them into as he manages a meek film, its visual splendor and Pacino's intense, brooding performance notwithstanding.Nolan's mark was conspicuous by its absence much to my chagrin as the story unfolded in a linear format, which was entirely unexpected. That was when I had a look at the credits and found that Nolan did not write this and he was just a director on this. Apart from Pacino, no one leaves a mark including Nolan. Robin Williams, after Good Will Hunting is particularly unconvincing (at least to me) in the role of a lousy writer while Hillary Swank was not needed and was never defined what she was supposed to do.Dialogue was never one of Nolan's characteristic abilities, which was painfully evident with this film, as we never root for any of the lead characters. By the time of its denouement we no longer care what happens to anyone in the film. It is a pity that the Nolan-Pacino combination ended in something like this which is kind of fitting, since they were never masters in each other's genre. If not for Pacino and breathtaking cinematography which pops in rather inadvertently, this movie would be unable to sit through.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Tense Thriller with Wonderful Performances,"Insomnia (2002)*** 1/2 (out of 4)A L.A. detective (Al Pacino) heads to Alaska to help a friend's police department investigate the strange murder of a teenage girl. The detective has drama going on back in L.A. but he finds himself in even more as insomnia sets in as he tries to crack this case. His job gets a bit more complicated when the killer (Robin Williams) comes to him for help.Christopher Nolan's INSOMNIA is a remake of an earlier film but this one here takes on its own identity and throw in three excellent performances and you've got everything you could possibly want out of a thriller. The film isn't your typical cat-and-mouse thriller because this here actually has a brain that has its characters constantly thinking and reaction to what's going on.The film works perfectly as a thriller because even though you know who the killer is it doesn't take away from the entertainment. The screenplay gives the detective and the killer so much development that you really get to know both of them, get to know their flaws and you really get inside their minds. This is a thriller without the mystery of finding out who the killer is and Nolan perfectly handles this and manages to build up suspense through the character's developments.Of course, when you've got such great performances it really helps. Pacino turns in one of his greatest performances in years as the detective who finds himself under an incredibly suspenseful situation while at the same time not fully functioning due to his new insomnia. I really thought Pacino was fabulous and especially as the film wears on and his character becomes more delusional. Williams is so calm, cool and collection that you can't help but find yourself liking him yet you have to remind yourself that he's a killer. The coldness that Williams brings shows what a terrific dramatic actor he was. Hilary Swank plays a supporting part and she too is quite good.INSOMNIA, on a technical level, is quite excellent with a wonderful score and some dazzling cinematography. Nolan perfectly handles the more dramatic actions scenes but also makes the dialogue scenes intense. The film is certainly one of the better thrillers of its time and remains highly entertaining.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Conscience never sleeps,"This is important movie in Nolan's directing career . After the success of ""The Following"" and especially ""Memento"" (two low budget thrillers) he got a chance to direct a big budget movie . He had chosen to create a remake of Swedish thriller – ""Insomnia"". It's not really hard to understand why . The Swedish original deals with themes and elements that Nolan talks about in his movies – the obsession , useful lie , morally ambiguous main hero , thin line between good and evil , women catalyst the plot , hero losing his grip on reality and the feel of neo-noir movie.It's interesting that this is Nolan's only movie that wasn't written by him . Every other movie he made was either written by him or co-written . Here Hilary Seitz is the only writer , although Nolan did consult the screenplay with him. I haven't seen the Swedish original , but from what I've heard this movie isn't a shot by shot remake and few things were changed. For more on the changes you should see the IMDb FAQ .""Insomnia"" seems less impressive compared to Nolan's earlier and later thrillers . Maybe because it feels like a rather conventional story . While other Nolan's thrillers either explored unknown grounds (""The Prestige"" , ""Inception"") or were told in creative non-chronological way (""The Following"" , ""Memento"") here ""Insomnia"" feels very un-Nolan like. Maybe it's because Seitz is the writer . The dialogue don't have that certain rhythm or British humor . Many little plot twists that change the situation don't appear here . The story is rather linear (with the exception of flashbacks) . Some people even don't know that this movie was made by Nolan.It doesn't mean that ""Insomnia"" isn't worth watching . Hell no. Since this is a cat and mouse game between cop and killer , where all the cards are put on the table from the beginning , Nolan tries different things here . The movie is much slower than his other movies . This time is all about the mood. Wally Pfister captures the cold beauty of Alaska well . The thriller is also very atmospheric and manages to capture how main hero is losing his grip on reality thanks to insomnia. There are two great scenes here : the shootout and the chase scene.The movie relies heavily on the psychological tension between the hero and the villain . Without good actors ""Insomnia"" would fell apart . Here , Al Pacino gives one of his better performance , especially in recent years , as the tired of fighting injustice cop . This movie also shows Nolan's sixth sense when it comes to inspired casting – Robin Williams. Before ""Insomnia"" and ""One hour photo"" people would laugh at the idea that Williams would play a criminal . Here , he gives he's character some truly disturbing creepiness hiding under quite sympathetic face. His character comes out like a cynical weirdo who doesn't seems to notice that he's doing bad things. The chemistry between Pacino and Williams in on of the strongest things in the movie.Hilary Swank seems to not have as much screen time as she needs and her character isn't too expanded . Too bad , because she feels quite crucial to the story . Also , the ending is kinda a letdown in that way it's not impressive and feels uninspired.""Insomnia"" is a good thriller that asks important question : how far would you go to defeat evil ? In a way it's a take on Dostoyevsky's ""Crime and punishment"". I love the metaphor here – conscience never sleeps . Just for that ""Insomnia"" is worth watching. Nolan's weakest movie yet is still a good movie. I give it 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Remembering when Hollywood made entertaining movies.,"It's a very good mystery story with lots of twists and turns. Plenty of potential gaps and loose ends but it all comes together nicely in this excellent script. Pacino is top notch as usual and his gradual deterioration from insomnia and mental anguish is always evident. Williams is surprisingly good as the creep and Swank is perfect as the upstart detective. The moral of the story is kind of summed up in one quote ""A good cop can't sleep because he is missing a piece to the puzzle. A bad cop can't sleep because of his conscience."" And the best part is it's pre woke so there isn't any mandatory messaging or casting shoved in your face. Definitely worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Nolan, Pacino and Williams Will Keep You Awake","The last good movie Al Pacino made (to date) is this movie with Robin Williams and Hilary Swank.It tells the story of two Los Angeles homicide detectives investigating the murder of a local teen, in an Alaskan town where the sun never sets.I can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here. Robin Williams is always reliable, but here he is truly awesome. Pacino brings his A Game for what appears to be the last time, whilst Swank is also on top form.There is something special about Pacino here, that has been missing in most of his work between then and now.Given the talent involved, I'm not surprised this failed to find an audience.Insomnia is a professional piece of work, suspenseful, with a good sense of atmosphere it makes for quality entertainment.

His insomnia was contagious; I started getting weary just feeling what he was going through.This is the first time I've seen Swank, and she was good but perhaps this is not the role that will convince me that she deserved her Academy Award.

"Lacking real suspense and anything unique, this is Christopher Nolan's least interesting work, by far","At a time where Swedish actor Stellan Skarsgård hadn't yet become Hollywood famous, a low-budget Scandinavian thriller film entitled Insomnia with him in the leading role garnered some reputation after eminent American film critics as Roger Ebert praised it. Five years later, in the year of 2002, British director Christopher Nolan adapted the material into a way bigger production, brought in A-listers Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and Hilary Swank, re-located for a small town in Alaska, while keeping the original title. The plot stayed the same as well: a long-time LAPD detective and his younger colleague are sent to The Last Frontier to assist in a homicide investigation. Before long, Insomnia veers away from the typical crime thriller when Pacino's character suffers from the eponymous illness and the delinquent suddenly crops up – having an ace up his sleeve.As an adorer of David Fincher's Se7en, I was instantly hooked by the John-Doe-esque suspense, but contrary to Kevin Spacey's intriguing psychopath, Insomnia's bad guy doesn't provide us with a spellbindingly intense finale, but merely a clichéd TV movie showdown. As fascinating as psychological thrill can be, omitting any other suspense rarely works. Two sub-par action sequences and brief glimpses of Pacino's insomniac hallucinations are all we get in these two hours and in this case, less isn't more. Such perpetual lack of intense scenes or violence could only be excused if it were a PG-13 film, which it is not! All of this is only slightly spiced up by what is most definitely Al Pacino's best acting performance in this century.Even though Nolan has several good approaches, Insomnia is nothing more than generic, unspectacular, and forgettable in the long run. Hillary Seitz's adapted screenplay is laden with crime show stereotypes and gratuitous dialogue but lacks real character development or any unique elements. The best example for this is Hilary Swank who obviously has the most unfavourable role as an aspiring assistant detective that wants nothing more than to get advise from the old-established cop. Due to all of that, remarkable achievements in terms of visuals can't help the film anymore than Pacino's dedicated acting and Insomnia is best watched on a weekday evening while eating lunch and conversing with your partner.",,Anonymous,Mystery

I would say ""Insomnia"" is a decent drama with a little thriller but I hoped for something better. It's definitely not bad. The acting game was amazing (of course) and the storyline was original. But not always so interesting. And I can't say the movie is a mystery. Again - it's good but with this actors and director good is not enough.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Nowhere near Nolan's best but still quite good,"Insomnia is probably the least of Christopher Nolan's films. That's not all that surprising when you consider it's not an original Nolan work but a remake of an earlier Norwegian film. What also should not be surprising is that even a lesser Christopher Nolan film is still a really good film. The guy doesn't make bad movies. Insomnia may lack the uniqueness of his original works. But this movie still has a compelling story to tell. And Nolan is more than up to the challenge of delivering that story in a fashion which is both entertaining and thought-provoking.The story centers around Los Angeles police detective Will Dormer who along with his partner has traveled to a small Alaskan town to assist with a murder investigation. Dormer is a notably famous cop, a hero, but left behind in Los Angeles is an internal affairs investigation which threatens to undo his life's work. As he lands in Alaska this weighs heavily on his mind. And things are about to get a whole lot worse. In the course of hunting down the Alaskan killer Dormer makes a huge, catastrophic mistake. If discovered this error really will bring Dormer's life crashing down. Crucially none of the Alaskan police he works with know what he has done. Unfortunately for Dormer one person does know: the killer. And now the killer sees himself as Dormer's partner. They're going to help one another get away with their respective misdeeds. Wracked by guilt, in a terrible moral quandary, what will Dormer do? He really is in a terrible state, made much worse by the fact he can't sleep at all. What's really keeping him awake? Is it the perpetual Alaskan sunlight? Or is it his own guilty conscience?The role of Dormer is pretty much perfect for Al Pacino who brings both a sense of authority and a great weariness to the role. Dormer, successful though he may be, is really being beaten down by life and up in Alaska things are only getting worse. The guy is crumbling and Pacino captures that very well. The other key performance comes from Robin Williams who shows up halfway through the film inhabiting a character who is quite unlike anything you'd expect from this particular actor. The film provides a chance for Williams to show off some serious acting chops and he delivers. Pacino and Williams play off one another brilliantly, the tension between their two characters is palpable and it drives the film forward. Hilary Swank has an important role as well, playing a young Alaskan police officer who idolizes Dormer but who does a little digging and realizes there may be some very bad things the famous detective has hidden away. To what lengths will Dormer go to protect those dangerous secrets? That is the crux of this film's plot. It's not your typical good guy/bad guy story. The lines between good and bad are not just blurred, they're completely wiped away. It's a smart story which really grabs you. And the film is photographed beautifully. The light might be forever shining but there is true darkness lurking here. Story, performances, photography...everything comes together very well. Even in a film which is not nearly his best effort Christopher Nolan produces something quite excellent.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A marvelous film.  Christopher Nolan does it again.,"When I saw Insomnia the first time I was a bit disappointed.  I have never been the biggest Hitchcock fan and this film seemed to be a page directly out of the Alfred Hitchcock guide book to film making.  It is not as if I hate Hitchcock I just think his techniques have become over used and cliche. I was really excited about this film before viewing because I am such a fan of Christopher Nolan from his work on Following and Memento.The biggest disappointment however was that the film made me tired.  I caught myself dosing off several times during the film.  Upon repeated viewing I realized that this was the brilliance of the film.  Nolan found a way, perhaps accidentally to make the viewer feel the same way as Al Pacino's character.  This is when it ocurred to me Nolan is still the genius he was two films ago.  The story is great, and the acting superb.  Robin Williams pulls off a great take on a mundane psycho, and Hillary Swank as in Boys Don't Cry helps carry the film.  I recommend this to any Hitchcock fan and if you love suspense films and find yourself disappointed the first time, watch it again and you will love it.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Between this one and the original, while they both consist of the exact same set up, I can relate to the Christopher Nolan version more since it contains more 'thinking' dialogue and can also relate to the North American setting as opposed to the 1997 version which i also give the same rating centers more on atmosphere and less on dialogue. One of the more memorable scenes has the two stars conversing with one another while sailing on a ferry boat, seeing Will (Pacino) look so helpless staring at the killer's face unable to do anything, and Walter projecting in speaking terms almost a mirror image of Will was an absolute classic and requires a heck of a lot of thought.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
a frequently overlooked gem,"Al Pacino stars as a Los Angeles homicide detective sent along with is partner Martin Donovan to the small town of Nightmute, Alaska to help with the investigation of a brutal homicide. They have partly been sent because local police chief Paul Dooley is a retired LA cop, but also because Internal Affairs has been investigating them and their boss wants them out of town. Donovan reveals to Pacino that he's been considering cooperating, a move that would ruin Pacino. While tracking down the murderer, a brutal accident puts Pacino in the hot seat. He tries to cover up his involvement, while suffering from insomnia due to the 24 hour daylight in this part of the world. Local rookie cop Hilary Swank, a great admirer of Pacino's, starts to realize something is wrong ... and the murderer (Robin Williams) himself contacts Pacino, revealing he knows what really happened and that he can help them both. This seems to be the least talked about of Nolan's films, which is a shame because it's a sharp and interesting remake of the 1997 Norwegian film that starred Stellan Skarsgard in Pacino's role. It's not a carbon copy of the original film, going different places with the same material. It's also one of the last really strong performances we got from Pacino.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

You know exactly where it's going from the opening 10 minutes. Even the ending does little to make it interesting. Christopher Nolan, you are the weakest link. In comparison to Memento this film is a major stinker.

The film Insomnia adds a few inventive notes to what could have been a typical and predictable drama picture.,"The film ""Insomnia"" adds a few inventive notes to what could have been a typical and predictable drama picture.  Constant daylight and chilling temperatures add an interesting backdrop to director Christopher Nolan's take on Nikolaj Frobenius' story of lies and deception in the suspense-filled, dark drama Insomnia.Will Dormer (played by veteran actor Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan II) are Los Angeles detectives sent to the remote town of (aptly named) Nightmute, Alaska to help the local police department solve the recent murder of a young teenage girl.  The film while having some interesting plot twists plays on the moral justification theme of `once you allow yourself to justify a lie or a wrong, no matter how right it seems at the time, you can easily lose your moral compass'.Nolan's wisdom in the selection of cinematographer Wally Pfister is evident. Pfister exhibits a Hitchcock-type style of foreboding in his selection of shots from the very beginning of the film.  The opening scene consists of an aerial shot in which a plane flies over what appears to be uncharted expansions of ice and water.  The pilot's voyage into the uncertain physical terrain provides a vivid metaphor for the characters' rapidly changing moral compasses.Robin Williams ventures from his normal comedic roles and gives a very believable portrayal of the creepy and morally deranged writer Walter Finch. So believable is his character interpretation that you may feel for his self-justification.  Al Pacino, who has often played the edgy detective (in films like Sea of Love and Heat), gives an acceptable depiction of a veteran detective struggling with his conscience.  Pacino exhibits his usual excellent style of acting and does not have to stretch much for this role.Director Christopher Nolan creates the perfect tension between local detective Ellie Burr played by actress Hilary Swank and Al Pacino as she conducts a separate investigation of a shooting incident.  This subplot further emphasizes the impact of dynamic moral compasses, as Swank wrestles with the effects of internal (as well as the more obvious external) conflicts upon her conscience.I enjoyed the movie ""Insomnia"" and recommend seeing this movie.  Director Christopher Nolan's use of dialog, plot and cinematography to emphasis moral justification at key points in the film shows that this director is bound for greatness.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good, worth your time, but could have been much better","This could have been such a great movie.Nolan's direction is definitive. The cinematography is near perfect. The score is inviting without ever descending to a cloying nature. The script, the story, the twists and turns of the writing are constantly engaging and feed the viewer's attention with scene after scene near perfection.Ms. Swank is wonderful.However, some of the casting is not as good as it could have been. Imagine Insomnia with Pacino and Williams replaced by Smith and Jones, two less prominent actors just as good as all the other elements of the movie and then you are approaching an IMDb rating of around 8. But, with Al and Robin I give it a 6.""Heresy!"", you say. An understandable reaction, given the elevated reputations of the two leads. I mean, the two mean are like cinematic gods, right? No, not really.Ever since 'Scent of a woman' Pacino has been offering the same, overacted character no matter what the project. And Robin? Go watch any interview he has given on a talk show over the last 20 years and you will see what to expect from him, because he can't get out of 'character' either, just like Al.Smith and Jones, two good actors, would have brought interpretations to the roles that would have probably been unique. In fact, I bet their interpretations would have garnered some award buzz. But, in the hands of tired Al and burnt out Robin we get exactly what we should expect from them: two characters that could have been in any other movie.Still pretty good, still watchable at least once. But, this ain't no classic Chris Nolan fans. I guess the good news is that he probably won't make the same mistake again.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Intriguing Daylight Noir,"Firm noir stands as one of the most challenging genres. By their nature the shades of grey characters require a deft touch to produce a relative hero and relative villain among the flawed characters. Contrast that with the slasher genre where one just hires a group of attractive but wholesome looking teenagers and one unattractive white guy, colors a few buckets of corn syrup red and you are good to go (by the way, this is also the recipe for a Tarrantino movie just add way too much droning dialog). Insomnia is good film noir. Nolan uses the breathtaking Alaskan scenery (although like the ""The Proposal"" somehow the movie was shot on one of the handful of beautiful, warm, summer days in Alaska rather than the other 340 frigid ones) to set a backdrop of overexposure and to sell the central premise that Pacino's LA detective can't adjust to the failure of the sun to traverse the sky. How Nolan got Hollywood's two biggest (outside of Nicholson and anyone in a Tarantino picture) scenery-chewing actors - Pacino and Williams to turn in subtle, nuanced performances is a mystery worth an Oscar in itself. Pacino's age occasionally comes off as problematic in the film as several pivotal scenes require a level of athleticism that he clearly no longer possesses (the famously fit Williams never seems over-matched by the demands). Hilary Swank has the opposite issue, she seems just a little too experienced to play the fawning, impressionable wannabe detective who uncovers Pacino's dirty, big, secret. Like any Nolan film, little annoyances pepper the outing such as the abortive relationship between Pacino and the hotel clerk - they seems close despite not spending any time together. In short, however, the smart, atmospheric mystery is worth the viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

We follow the unfolding of the investigation as the main character, Detective Will Dormer, goes into a spiral of daydreams for not being able to sleep.However, the themes of Insomnia are based on the moral dilemma that Will faces due to the fact that American Internal Affairs Department is investigating him for misconduct, putting in check his reputation, career, and work, which can culminate in several cases being reopened, criminals returning to the streets, and his own dubious conduct in the face of the incident in the story that sets the plot in motion. The incident itself is the basis of Insomnia's moral problem and the investigation of the murder becomes the external factor.Al Pacino's performance is the traditional one, but who steals the show here is Robin Williams as Walter Finch, one of the suspects in the crime. Al maintains his run-of-the-mill tough-as-gangster side, but Robin delivers a compelling character through well-constructed dialogue.I think my only problem is how silly Will is made by the antagonist. At no point, including in the climax, does Will take control of the situation, suffering from the antagonist's manipulation and also from his decadence in the face of insomnia. Even when it looks like Will will take the reins, the antagonist sweeps him off. Not even the character of Ellie Burr gets the spotlight; Maybe she could be the companion that gets the protagonist back on track. However, Will is one of those solo heroes and this ends up being his ruin. By the time the movie ends, we're fed up.The cinematic elements are a mix of very good and weird. The cinematography is great when it depicts the natural beauty of Alaska. On the other hand, the effects that demonstrate Will's increasing hallucinations are not so good. However, in general, the film has a good rhythm.The director of this film is Christopher Nolan and we can see his touch on the film. With an estimated budget of $46 million and a super cast, considering the year of release Insomnia isn't an overproduction, but it works; It doesn't stand out for any transcendent factor, in the end being just an acceptable mystery.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Neglected Nolan Film Well Worth Revisiting,"We all know that it's our real or perceived weaknesses, mistakes and transgressions that keep us awake at night; left to themselves they can run riot. Unable to rest, we lose perspective, our memory plays tricks on us and guilt - justified or not - can become overwhelming. Soon we're caught in a circular trap, from which we can only be freed by sleep or the morning.It's precisely this insomnia that haunt's Nolan's third film; Dormer (Pacino) is haunted throughout by an assortment of vulnerabilities. Some of these are a simple fact of the passage of time and humanity - the threat of a turned ankle after a jump, slipping under the logs giving chase, an inability to sleep in bright light. Others are real guilt, an increasing doubt of his own motives, or the temptations of being away from home and whatever his more 'normal' family life might be. This is all given force by the parallelisms between Dormer and Robin Williams's character, and the Internal Affairs investigation with the central murder.These are all strengths of a script that, unusually for a Nolan film, isn't written by the director. I haven't seen the film it's a remake of, but certainly it's a film that unlike many of Nolan's other films (which he at least co-writes), its main female characters are complex, interesting creations with genuine agency. Photographed by long-term collaborator Wally Pfister, the film is soaked in cold, almost metallic shades (amongst others) of blue, lending a sense of the eerie to a film which, driven by a Pacino performance that for the most part avoids his latter-day tendency to self-parody, brilliantly evokes the way an inability to sleep feels all the day round. Unlike many Nolan films, the story is entirely linear; but it retains his obsessions with how our past informs our present, and the film plays with that as the flashes of visons that haunt that Dormer suggests a suppression of his past that threatens to overwhelm in - and by the end, does.This is often seen as a minor Nolan film, on the way to the more successful and lauded films that lay in his future. But it deserves attention for all these reasons, not to mention the much missed Robin Williams's haunting and controlled performance. If Inception would take the cinema of dreams to somewhere new, this asks uncomfortable questions about what makes us unable to sleep ... and therefore to also dream. Showcasing as it does a deft thriller plot, his customary technical excellence and female characters who are better drawn than his usual, this is a corner of the Nolan filmography ripe for a revisiting.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"I could easily fall asleep while watching, ""Insomnia""!!","It's the same cookie-cutter cop vs killer movie, same formula you've seen over and over and over. The only deviation was - did he do it, did he know he was doing it, did he mean to do it, should we cover it up? Etc.. etc.. Basically the standard 'Morality' issues (no spoilers in this review). Hence, a middle of the road review.I've never been a huge fan of Robin Williams - I don't even find him funny, so when he tries to play serious roles, I find him even less entertaining. Now, he's a bad guy... nope! I can't explain it, but he just wasn't the right person to cast in this movie!!RECOMMEND: Just slightly above average. I'd say your chances of liking it is 50/50.

Very Insomnia!,"I can't believe I never found out about this movie. I watched it just recently. Al Pacino and Robin Williams were great! I never thought Robin Williams could do serious work. He was very serious in this one. He was also very serious in the movie The Final Cut. This story is about a Cop from Los Angeles traveling to Alaska in regards to a murder of a 17 year old girl who had been brutally bashed to death. What Pacino didn't know was that the sun never goes down in Alaska in Winter. It effects his sleeping patterns and gets dizzy every day. Pacino then bumps into a dark mysterious writer named Walter Finch. Everyone thinks he's the murderer. But is he? You'll have to watch the film to find out. The director Christopher Nolan did a great job at keeping the camera still. It never moved or bounced up and down once. he always kept it straight and still. Great action, acting and directing.

"Nothing special, story is pretty flat and the atmosphere is not really great","Nothing thrilling, it is more like a procedural with some twists. The procedural wasn't tense and the twists therefore just happened along the way.To me there is a nonchalant way of telling this story, embodied by the ever nonchalant Pacino. The Internal Affairs back-story may have looked brilliant at the time, but it totally dilutes the case and actual setting. Choosing permanent daylight season may have looked brilliant too but it loses the edginess of a tired cop too used to open his eyes in the dark.In the end nothing really caught my eye - I would even say I found the overall editing of the story choppy - and most of all the Insomnia gimmick didn't work and fast became annoying.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good performances, but not a great film","I saw a sneak preview of this film tonight and I wasn't terribly impressed. I thought Al Pacino's performance was one of the better ones his given recently, and it was nice to see Robin Williams in a serious role.  I thought Hillary Swank's performance was average, but the character was a little cliched and underdeveloped.  The supporting cast was fine, but the movie is really about Pacino's character and he really looks like he hasn't slept for days. The movie was a little confusing to follow at first (but makes sense in retrospect) and develops somewhat slowly.  It definitely gains steam as the movie moves along.  There really isn't a lot of suspense as to who dunnit? and the ending is also not too surprising.  That's not to say the movie isn't suspenseful or interesting.  The intrigue comes from watching how Pacino's character deals with the situation and how the story will reach the inevitable finish.  The interaction between Pacino and William's characters is great, especially in the interrogation scene.  William's character probably could have been fleshed out a little more. Probably the best thing about the movie was the scenery.  The film takes place in Alaska and the locations are stunning.  That alone is almost worth the price of admission. I don't think this movie will leave an impression on its audience like Memento, but it's a different type of movie.  If you like Al Pacino or movies that focus on characters put in situations where they are forced to question their previous actions, it's worth seeing.  Otherwise, you might find it a bit dull.I'd give it a *** out of *****",,Anonymous,Mystery
2 Hours I Will Never Get Back,"Who ever is calling this a smart adult movie is wrong. This movie has nothing on the likes of Memento. I had originally heard that due to insomnia, Pacino wasn't even sure if he had killed his partner, and that sounded intriguing. The fact that in the end he wasnt sure of his motivation was very unconvincing. There are no smart twists in this movie. In my opinion the acting wasn't that great either, just because Pacino looked like he hasnt slept in a week doesn't make for a great performance, because thats pretty much the way he looks all the time, same with that crappy In The Bedroom movie, just because Sissy Spacek looked burned out and crazy doesnt mean she gave a great performance, shes looks like that naturally. There were a few decent parts to the movie, like when Pacino was trying to stay awake driving and almost left the road, but that doesnt make up for the rest fo the crap. The detective work was alright too, better then an Ace Ventura movie anyways but overall the movie wasn't good at all. When I check my watch several times during a movie and finally leave, never wanting to watch that movie again I know it isnt a good movie. I should have watched Undervocer Brother.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great Alaska scenery is the backdrop for murder...,"I thought this film was going to be one of those grisly slasher movies, but I'm glad I was mistaken!  Pacino is, as usual, on his mark!  In my mind, he's one of the best actors of all time.  This film shows why:Pacino and his LAPD partner, Donovan, are called by one of Pacino's friends to a small-town community in Alaska, where a 17-year-old-girl is murdered. Wasting no time, Pacino goes right to work, possibly wanting to take his mind off the troubles he has back home with his own affairs...The suspects dwindle, and Pacino wastes no time even further dwindling that list, but what he has left is a group of people that any one of them could have done it...or could they?Hillary Swank was the downfall to this film.  From the first time she meets with Pacino, she holds him on a pedestal, even going as far as quoting some of his previous work (even the address of a murder scene in one of his past cases).  It was obvious to everyone what a fan she was of Pacino, but they took it a little too far...Overall, this is an excellent movie!  The scenery was breath-taking (one of those, ""I wish I would have seen it on the big screen"" moments) and the characterization of Robin Williams (who was billed way too high for this film, since he doesn't enter the picture until about half-way through) as a writer was pretty good, also.  In fact, I found myself asking some pretty interesting questions throughout.Pacino fans and Williams fans alike will enjoy this film.  I gave it a somewhat-generous 9 because I lost myself in the film...I could really see something like this happening!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"No brawling fistfights here, just pensive dialog","Although I love this film and rate it ten out of ten, I do admit that there's something missing, and I can't quite put my finger on exactly what that ""something"" is.  However, I think that if anything was added to compensate for that missing ""something"" the eerie subtly of everything would be trampled.I think a large part of Insomnia's effectiveness has as much to do with David Julyan's film score as it does with Pacino and Williams' wonderful performances.  Sure, the entire movie is ""bleak"" and gloomy (and the score sure adds to it), but what do you expect from a movie with a plot that revolves the murder of a young girl?  You sure as heck don't walk into the theater expecting some feel-good, heartwarming piece of crap that you'd see any other time of the year, that's for sure. We need more movies like Chris Nolan's Insomnia; it's unrelenting yet delicate, and I think that's what's putting people off.  What many want are macho brawling fistfights between Williams and Pacino, but what they get are pensive and thought-provoking dialogue (plus a little shootout near the end.)  Personally, I'm glad we get to see Williams and Pacino talk things out most of the time instead of beating the crap out of eachother in every scene.  They'd be wasting their talent if there was no dialog interaction between the two.My rating: ten out of ten",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
excellent,"I found this movie to be a big cut above the run-of-the-mill shoot-em-up thrillers churned out nowadays. The creepy atmosphere of this remote Alaskan town in the far north country where the sun never sets is captured very well and creates an unsettled and unnerving undercurrent. Pacino's and William's work is very good here. The story, in addition to being a superb crime drama, is an excellently crafted tale of moral ambiguity, as the policeman's fate becomes slowly and inexorably conflated with that of the perpetrator. A movie for grownups, I think.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pacino gives a masterclass in how to act exhausted,"Insomnia is a very solid detective, crime thriller which is elevated by superbly inter-woven character development and excellent performances.Al Pacino plays a slowly psychologically unravelling, detective. Once an invincible hero-cop, now carrying secrets, and facing a reckoning for his past actions.Robin Williams plays against-type and demonstrates his acting range as the antagonist killer. Intrigued by Al Pacino's detective, he shines a spotlight on their similarities, much to Pacino's revulsion. It is this push and pull dynamic that makes Insomnia such a magnetic watch.Hilary Swank is the light to Al Pacino's dark. Young, ambitious and uncompromising in her idealism. She brings a truthfulness to the investigation and to the film itself, encouraged by Pacino even if it means his own downfall.This dynamic between the three leads plays out in the isolated backdrop of the relentless Alaskan sun. There is no hiding from it, turning Pacino into an insomniac. And Pacino gives a masterclass in sleep-deprivation acting.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Swank and Williams did a good job as well, both of them believable. I did not, however, like the way the film was cut. Always flashing back to scenes that don't make sense untill the very end. That really took me away from the film. I constantly found myself turning to a friend asking, ""what the heck was that?""

As for Nolan, Memento had an ethereal charm in being stitched together by cat gut. This is plain bull. Robin Williams is plain wasted, both as a comic and as an actor.

Botched remake,"Look, Nolan is an incredibly talented director. He even does a nice job with the visuals in this remake of the vastly superior original, but that's the whole thing - the original is just so much more believable and human and messy and interesting. Hollywood again feels they have to clean up a flawed character - well, damnit, then write your own cop movie and leave the original alone. I also (maybe I'm in the minority here) can't stand Robin Williams when he tries to ACT! he is so one-note, so stilted, he made the killer so bland and boring it really hurt the remake. Seriously, go back and look at his performance - there is NOTHING going on in the eyes, face, nothing. he doesn't know what to do so he keeps himself tight-lipped and tries to give a sinister smile every now and then.

Definitely One of Nolan's Best.,"I didn't know what to expect from this film. Upon watching The Dark Knight Rises only a few days earlier, I had heard that this was Nolan's worst film. Well, after seeing TDKR, which is riddled with unsubtle dialogue and bland pacing, I expected Insomnia to put me to sleep.It did not. In fact, it's now in my top three of favorite Nolan films.Here's why: Al Pacino gives a riveting and quite subtle performance as a detective plagued by mistakes in his past. As the mystery of a murder in a small Alaskan town begins to get more and more interesting, we learn more about how far Pacino's character is willing to go to reach justice, but we also see him falter, and succumb to more personal demons. It's a sublime performance, and I personally think he's one of Nolan's most layered and interesting characters.All other cast performances are amazing, including a memorable turn from Hillary Swank, who plays her role with a sense of keen suspicion and humbled intellect. But, the real standout next to Pacino is Robin Williams. I will give no spoilers about his character here, but when he's onscreen, it's easy to see why Williams won an Oscar years prior. He's a master of acting innocent but disturbed all at once. A truly gripping performance, that absolutely holds its own next to Pacino's greatness.The real beauty here is Nolan's direction. The tension is palpable, and is far more engaging and riveting than the few action scenes the film has, (though the action itself is great too!) The cinematography is top-notch, and really brings you into this small town world, adding a sense of paranoia and constant fear to each scene, as if someone is always watching, and no secret is truly unknown. Nolan creates an atmosphere through the performances that is perfect, and added to the location and cinematography, all three of them blend together strongly to form a fully matured motion picture. Truly worthy of being called a ""thriller"" in every sense of the word. Nolan's pacing may be off in TDKR, but not in Insomnia. Definitely not in Insomnia.I was truly mesmerized at the moral quandaries the film presents. I can't speak too much about them since I don't want to give spoilers, but no other film I've seen, especially a detective film, has dealt and shown grief and regret in such a fascinating way. The lines in this world are grey, and even the best people make mistakes. Mistakes which the characters much learn to live with in order to fit their own justice. Its engaging questions and themes are explored in depth, and never come off as preachy.In conclusion, Insomnia is truly one of Nolan's best, and is an underrated gem. Please watch this film. It deserves, and needs to be seen. A deep exploration of morality, filled with a tense atmosphere, and wonderful performances. Films like Insomnia are cinema at its grandest.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Nolan's Most Underrated,"It's Interstellar week so my quest to go back and review all of Christopher Nolan's previous films continues.It seems weird calling Insomnia Christopher Nolan's most underrated movie considering I also think it's his worst film. But saying it's his worst is saying a lot. Insomnia is a brilliant psychological crime thriller that has a lot of the same beats as other police dramas but it definitely has the Nolan flavor along with it. It's about a detective Will Dormer, played by Al Pacino, who is forced to take up a case in Alaska with his partner in order to save his job because of previous mishaps on a case. The case is one of Kay Connel, a fan of Walter Finch's crime novels.As the movie progresses not only does Dormer have trouble sleeping, hence the title, but has to face his inner demons and mistakes he has made that have shaped an inescapable position. Pacino is brilliant in this film and plays well off of Robin Williams, who plays a surprisingly terrifying villain. I think this is another case of the acting in Nolan's films being overlooked. Nolan always creates great material for his actors to work with and puts them in perfect positions, but only one acting academy nomination has ever come from one of his films. I'm not sure Williams or Pacino's performances should have won Oscars but they are definitely under-appreciated.It's hard not to mention Hilary Swank who gives another incredible performance in a movie that she could have easily been overshadowed by two of the all time greats. Insomnia is one of the all time great crime films and I really hope that after Interstellar Nolan moves back into that genre and maybe even brings back Pacino for something. Perhaps something less cerebral than Inception but captures the intensity that Insomnia does, with the incredible characters of The Prestige. Go check out Insomnia and you will be pleased with the outcome.+One of Pacino's last great performances+Intense and thought provoking (as usual with Nolan)+Swank's overlooked performance+Williams creepy villain+Nolan directing a crime film-Ending a bit of letdown compared to other Nolan films9.3/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
When deception goes awry...,"This film is great on several levels.  Pacino and Swank play off one another with classic big city detective/ small town officer roles that appear to be made for them.

The bonus is Robin Williams in another (less than comedic) role, which he pulls off extremely well.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not the best effort of anyone involved, by some distance.","I refer mostly to esteemed director Christopher Nolan, actors Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank as the most notable here. To be honest I wasn't impressed with any singular aspect in terms of scripting, cinematography, directing, pacing, setting or anything intrinsic to great film-making. Even taken together, I did not find this picture particularly engrossing.Al Pacino's performance is best described as workmanlike. There is none of the showmanship or nuance displayed in Scent Of A Woman, Devil's Advocate, Heat or The Godfather. Bereft of a good script or a chance for one of his trademark speeches, Pacino relies on hangdog expressions as much as Julia Roberts relies on doe-eyed expressions in Notting Hill. From an actor of such obvious ability, this is disappointing. Robin Williams fares no better as the villain. He employs subtlety in a similar manner to his role in One Hour Photo but the effect falls flat here as his character fails to have any depth. There is no reason to hate him, there is no reason to understand him, sympathise with him or be terrified by him. Hilary Swank tries her best with the material but comes up as short as the rest. Martin Donovan is utterly forgettable, even considering the use of flashback scenes and mild hallucinations.The most disappointing aspect has to be the direction. Having seen such fine, genre-defining work from Nolan, it's very sad to see him flounder with this. I didn't necessarily expect clever trickery, complex editing or any of his other hallmarks, but with greater attention to the style and mood of the genre (in this case detective thriller with some film noir undertones) he could have made this much more engrossing. Instead we're lumbered with slow push-in shots, standard alternation between close-up and distance shots for action scenes and pedestrian back/forth shots for one-on-one dialogue. The entire direction fails to create a sense of mood or tension. Even the relative beauty of Alaska is not exploited, or even used except in one short scene where Pacino loses control of his vehicle.There is no sense of progression here. A complete absence of short shocks or built-up set-pieces further desecrates the picture - well, more accurately they are THERE but they're completely ineffectual and usually feel forced. You feel them coming because you've seen them done better in countless other pictures. Al Pacino does not seem any more of an insomniac at the end than he does at the beginning - it's not the make-up, it's the lack of performance. Robin Williams comes in too late and as mentioned, adds no drama or tension.The whole thing plods along without ever taking off. I was waiting for a defining moment, a spark, some kind of twist that would offset some of the obvious weaknesses but it never came. There was never a moment or a line that explained the predicament and gave the film the deeper portent it was aiming for. The plot unravels in ones mind only moments after the credits roll with notable holes and lack of substance.Perhaps I've been spoilt by such great film-making I've become jaded, but considering past performances by the creators I wasn't expecting to be left in such a malady. I am reminded of the recently released 88 Minutes which I happened to see before this picture. Sadly, although that picture is also far from top quality, I happened to find it somewhat more effective.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good,"Just saw Insomnia at a preview here at school, really good movie.  I thought the sound-track was quite appropriate, very similar to the one in Memento, and fits just as well.  C. Nolan does a excellent job of telling/viewing the story from the main characters point of view which I think really helped to pull the audience into the movie.  The quality of acting is a no brainer, what else can you get besides excellence when you put Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hillary Swank together.  This is definitely a must-see.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"It's not my favorite thing, but I can sleep in the daytime if tired","I hadn't seen this is 20 years and the only thing I remembered was a chase through the fog of Alaska. Not sure what I thought of it then, but the fact that I forgot all of it is not the most positive sign, but it's engrossing. The atmosphere is certainly terrific and the two lead actors, Pacino and Williams, are fine, but both characters are repulsive human beings, one obviously much worse than the other. It's an interesting cat and mouse game and an unusual mystery primarily due to the locale. This is early Nolan and it all makes sense as opposed to his now mega-filmmaking which many times is something fantastic to look at and a puzzle to understand. As of 2022, Memento might still his best film even though some of his later films have moments of awe, all have merits and Dunkirk is truly outstanding. As far as this one is concerned, I think it a well made film in a great environment, but again, I did not like the primary characters and it is a gloomy picture to start with and a mighty depressing one by the time it ends.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Amazingly good movie that will stand the test of time!,"Perhaps my favourite Alaskan movie, maybe even my favourite Al Pacino movie and surely guaranteed one of Robin Williams best non comedic roles. INSOMNIA! A movie directed by Christopher Nolan is a movie about a mysterious murder that in a remote town in Alaska lacks the resources in law enforcement to solve it so two detectives from Los Angelas are flown in to help solve it. Yeah so its a pretty basic who done it type movie besides the whole Alaska thing.But what I love about this movie is the realism that Christopher Nolan is famous for. Even before he was known for Batman his movies had that amazing look Nolan is famous for.  The cinematography is incredible. Its like a travel brochure for Alaska! Its simply amazing. The story is great. It leaves you in suspense wondering whats going on but in a good way. And not to spoil anything but the reason its called INSOMNIA is its filmed in the part of summer where the sun never sets (sort of the same as the movie 30 days of night). It just adds to the films allure.So if you like great crime movies in the ""Who done it"" genre and you haven't seen this flick? Where have you been!?! Its time to track this movie down and watch it. You will be in awe. Especially if you're a fan of Christopher Nolan's other work or like the actors Al Pacino, Hilary Swank or Robin Williams.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not Nolan's best. It's pretty thought-provoking, not awesome.","Christopher Nolan's previous movies, INSOMNIA, brings a very interesting and complex story that brings in terrifying conspiracies and though-provoking enjoyment. From murders to the protagonists' struggle with sleep, it really does bring some eye-catching moments and very much brings good ""hold onto your seats"" thrill-rides that makes the audience want to understand more about what could and had been happening.It's not the best Nolan film, but Robin Williams and Al Pacino pull off a very warm-welcoming investigation to there own by bringing fantastic enjoyment to a never-ending chapter of pure excitement to its own synopsis. It's a watchable movie, but it does not go beyond other Nolan projects.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Half-baked in Alaska.,"Much like a pivotal scene in the movie, a superb cast are stranded in this well below average movie, seemingly fogbound by their own collective credibility. These are leaden characters, who act without motivation, in a film teeming with implausibilities and plot-holes. The unusual setting, used to such mesmerising effect in the Coen brothers' ""Fargo"", or Fincher's ""Se7en"", is merely a gimmick here that does nothing to hide the obvious shortfalls. Actually, the film owes much to Fincher's, atmospherically at least, and various scenes bring it to mind, most notably the chase through the fog, reminiscent of Brad Pitt's pursuit through the rain-drenched alleyways of ""Se7en"".The film wants to be too much, and achieves very little, and, despite everything ending wrapped up in a neat little parcel, it's the sluggish direction that is the real let-down.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Most overhyped movie of the year,"After trailers extolling the prizes awarded to the actors and declaring it the movie of the year the last thing i was expecting was an average movie. I also wasnt expecting Robin Williams to be so bad, misreading his character so completely and at times obviously reading from an autocue, harsh yes but true.

But ""Insomnia"" is something completely else. The leading roles are for Al Pacino and Robin Williams, who are giving the best of the best performances! Furthermore there is two times Oscar-winning actress Hilary Swank. So far the cast, now let's say something about the story, which is truly remarkable. It's brilliantly written and it will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time.This is without any doubt the best Pacino-movie of the last few years. Pacino and Williams are an excellent on-screen duo. It's a shame this movie received hardly any awards for the acting performances. This was the second time I watched ""Insomnia"", so I knew the story, but that didn't bother. I still loved it!To conclude I would like to give a quote I loved a lot: ""Life is so important.

Crafty little thriller,"A few weeks ago my mom and I were watching Insomnia on TV when it was storming out and right as the conclusion was about to happen, the power went out! Don't you hate it when that happens? So I just had to rent this movie and finish it, I just watched it this morning and I have to say that Insomnia was a very clever thriller, almost on the edge of Hitchcock. The plot was so very interesting and also makes you question your own ethics on what is right and what is wrong. It's rare that a movie really does have that kind of effect on you, where you almost wonder if it would be so bad if someone got away with something so terrible. The actors in this film were absolutely terrific in their performances, especially Robin Williams who has proved to many that he can act brilliantly in a drama and now in the thrillers. Insomnia is a clever thriller that I was very impressed with.Will Dormer and Hap Eckhart are two detectives from L.A. who are coming to Alaska to investigate a the fatal beating of a 17 year old girl, Kay. Dormer meets another cop who admires his work, Ellie Burr. Together along with other policemen they find the killer, but he gets away. In the middle of trying to find the killer in the deep woods in the thickest fog, Will accidentally shoots Hap thinking he's the killer. But scared, Will tells everyone it was the killer that shot him, but then Will gets a phone call from the killer and he knows about Hap. Now Will has a chance to get off scott free along with the killer, but it's a question of him being able to live with this horrible secret while someone who's innocent goes to jail for the killer's crime.Insomnia is a great thriller, I was incredibly pleased with how well it worked. Al Pacino, Hilary Swank, and Robin Willaims all did a terrific job of acting, they really clicked and made the film work. I think one of the scenes that really got to me was Dormer explaining to Rachel about his ways in L.A., what he was ""escaping"" from, you'll have to see what I mean. But Pacino does a grade A job of acting in that scene, he made it so effective to where you would question on what you would do in a tough situation. I would highly recommend Insomnia, it's a terrific film, just don't watch it in the middle of a bad storm, the ending might get cut off, lol.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
You Won't Sleep,"Impossible to sleep while watching this movie! Why? Its a thriller for one thing full of a good story with fine acting and directing. To make it even more interesting, it takes place in Alaska and has story within story dynamics something that if done right is most satisfying to viewers. This is done right. It takes a short while to get used to Robin in a serious role but it works so well. Pacino is worth the price of a ticket on his own too. He makes such a good cop because he is an experienced actor. Small town life here is worth noting with everyone knowing everyone else and complications don't exist. Life is predicable and repeats itself making you wonder if that is what everyone has in common who lives there? The entire little town seems to be fenced in with mountains but does have ferry boat, waterway and sea plane access as well as long stretches of highway all scenic as a plus. I bet the air there is as clean as you can get it. Good movie to snack on as the story unfolds or have a sandwich ready to go with a tasty drink. One thing that bears noting is the way Pacino has trouble literally keeping his eyes open as he is acting out not being able to sleep for days. If you watch his expressions, I warn you upfront, you may get a little drowsy but do finish the movie at all costs. Then nap if you can",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sleepy-eyed Pacino well met,"Will Dormer (Al Pacino) is a Los Angeles cop who is sent along with his partner to a rural Alaskan town to investigate the murder of a young girl. While chasing a possible suspect, however, Dormer accidentally shoots his partner, with whom he had had a recent argument, in a dense fog.  Rather than admit his own guilt, though, Dormer tries a coverup, thinking that no one could know what really happened. But someone did see - the man Dormer and his partner were chasing.What follows is a taut cat-and-mouse game. Walter Finch (Robin Williams) knows what really happened in the murky fog, and he'd like to help Dormer cover it all up - but for a price. And in addition, the shooting of Dormer's partner is also being investigated, separately, by a novice detective named Ellie (Hillary Swank), who idolizes the veteran cop. Something's got to give - Ellie's a great young mind, and it'll only be a matter of time before she figures it out, right?Every movie, save for the mindless, faceless action films, must have some kind of hook for the audience, something to make it unique. In this case, it's the fact that Williams is playing a bad guy - an atypical role. And it's a great role for him, too, as he does a fine job getting to the meat of the character. Pacino's got a good character to play as well - think Serpico - and he's at his best while underplaying thinking man's roles (okay, I'm not forgetting his younger, wilder days as Michael Corleone, but his best work as a pure actor are with these roles). Add in the beautiful Alaska scenery and the fact that it's light out for much, much longer periods than it is for those of us in the continental U.S., and you have quite the setting for a modern film noir, so to speak.The title comes from the fact that Dormer simply can't sleep after he's accidentally (or was it an accident?) shot his partner. He's haunted by images of his dying partner; racked with self-doubt, he also has trouble sleeping because of the endless light in Alaska, resorting to taping his shades closed and placing objects in front of the window to make it darker. And because of his inability to sleep, he becomes very strung out, unable to think clearly.This movie is from the director of Memento, which was a fascinating film noir in its own right, expertly written and directed. Because Memento was so good, I did have higher hopes for Insomnia. Insomnia isn't nearly as good as Memento, but it's still a very well done, intriguing psychological thriller with an excellent cast.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Put me to sleep,"The script defies convention by revealing the killer early on, the cast and director makes for a stellar line-up, yet this film doesn't hit the heights it should. The tension is slack, Nolan opting for a morality film which might have worked well if the issues were more fully explored. It remains an enjoyable film, however Nolan's direction does the cast and script a slight disservice.The performances of Swank, Pacino, and Williams are consistently good. However there is a lack of chemistry within each relationship in this film, in stark contrast to Memento. The LA investigation is touched on in a rather light fashion for a plot device on which the ethical dilemmas of the film come to hinge.The two murders committed in the film are not given equal moral complexity, which might cloud the judgement of the viewer. It is clear all along that Nolan is placing the audience on the conventional side of the moral equation.Despite these flaws, Pacino shines as the decorated cop whose years in the job have eroded his moral fibre.

I did enjoy this version of it, I wasn't nodding off in the theatre, but I do have to say it lacked that thrilling kinky edge of both Following and Memento; there is something to be said for non-linear storylines and Nolan is brilliant at them.  I hope in his next film he explores that sort of thing again.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
under-appreciated Nolan film....,"Nolan's sophomore effort is unfortunately jinxed as being his most underrated, although arguably his strongest film so far. A detective whose task is to nail a killer finds himself murdering a colleague, because he might have compromised his decisions on past cases to Internal Affairs. The man is conscientious - did he kill him on purpose, or was it a genuine accident ? He cannot decide, but either way he did fire the fatal bullet, and this robs him of his sleep - hence the title. Worst of all, the killer he's looking for saw him do it and is now threatening to compromise him further. So very Shakespearean - Nolan himself calls it ""Hitchcockian"" on the director's commentary. Pfister's camera takes in some gorgeous Vancouver scenery, and Al Pacino hits this one right out of the ballpark. Just watch Pacino during the interrogation scene. There's a beautifully acted moment when he is restraining himself terribly from lunging across the table and strangling the murderer - so much does he hate his guts. Nolan is so intensely focused on the internal drama of the leads, he chooses very simple and direct shots, which are nonetheless elegant. Compare this to David Fincher's Seven, an exquisitely stylized movie that is ultimately about nothing real. Unlike the chilling but wholly unrealistic John Does and Hannibal Lecters of the film world, killers in real life are most often the weakest of human beings - Fincher admitted this with regard to the Zodiac killer - and that is the whole point of Robin Williams' character in Insomnia : a weak, cowardly and very ordinary man who becomes a killer simply by unfortunate accident ; a forlorn middle-ager who dares to imagine himself in love with the first seventeen-year-old girl who gives him some attention, and then kills her when she offends him by literally laughing at his advances.Admittedly Nolan's austere visual style may leave something to be desired for. Occasionally the film feels too talky - too much dialog and character-based exposition, and too little of things actually happening. But these are minor nitpicks.Apparently there weren't enough Batmobiles and explosions to satisfy the popcorn-munching hipster douche bags who also saw this film. Empty thrillers like Seven and The Silence of the Lambs which are thematically hollow and pointless will always garner greater popularity than a deeply psychological film like Insomnia.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Black and white where it should have been grey,"Insomnia is a film concerned with a grey landscape and the grey areas of the characters morality.  Or at least that is what the Norwegian original successfully conveyed.Christopher Nolan's remake seems bound to a script determined to make explicit many of the ambiguities that made the original so fascinating. Everything seems to need a motive in this, as though cineplex audiences wouldn't be able to understand the main protagonist, Dormer's (Pacino), feelings of guilt and and panic at what he has done without lengthy argumentative speeches and a tacked-on possible motive of vengeance. Perhaps that is what comes of heavyweight names above the title - you have to give them their grandstanding moments.Martin Donovan's role was cruelly underwritten, and came across as more of a plot device than a fully-developed character.  A shame, as I felt he could have been a useful counterpoint to Pacino's bluster.  There was little of the warmth of his Norwegian parallel, and a later exchange between Pacino and the hotel receptionist made little impact because of it.There were other ways in which this had been dumbed-down and sanitised. For example, a scene where Pacino shoots a dead dog.  In the original, this dog is alive and healthy and has previously witnessed his guilt.  The act of coldly shooting a live dog is far more shocking and resonant, making the audience seriously question how far this man will go to protect his secrets. The remake, again, turns this powerful scene into a convenient plot device, with only a fraction of the meaning.The films ending, whilst superficially similar to the original, tidys up all the loose ends of the plot and sees that justice is done.  As such it leaves the audience entertained but not provoked or inspired, as the original's moral questions and ambiguity had done.Ironically, this remake of Insomnia is less how one would imagine a Christopher Nolan film to be than the Norwegian original.  Although a handful of his stylistic flourishes still make it into this film (the wiper blades, the rubber gloves, the clever narrative reversal of the opening modus operandi sequence), his ability to make the audience question the moral rights and wrongs of the characters, even beyond the end of the film, is sadly underused here.Insomnia is by no means a *bad* film.  It just doesn't, in my opinion, do justice to the talent working on it and as such was a great disappointment. Nolan is, on the strength of both Following and Memento, a truly inspired talent and it would be a great shame to see him become little more than a ""name"" director in Hollywood, when he could be something as special as the next Kubrick or Roeg.",,Anonymous,Mystery

"Christopher Nolan Goes Chronological, and Almost Gets Another Neo-Classic","Christopher Nolan's previous two films, ""Following"" and the buzz-starter ""Memento"", have earned him quite the attention.  It seems he's been dubbed one of those rare directors who can put out mainstream films with an artsy/""underground"" feel and appeal, all after only two movies.  His latest, a remake of the 1997 foreign thriller ""Insomnia"", features no lasting gimmick, which, interestingly, detracts from the film, but instead features excellent performances and setting/cinematography to solidify it.The best thing about the film is the great acting performances from the big-name leads.  Robin Williams shows he can be as convincing a disturbing villain as a beloved family hero.  Al Pacino sells the sleepless induced descent to madness of his character brilliantly, but otherwise is just his normal self (which is still good, but it's difficult to see him as the ""beloved good cop"" the script makes his character out to be).  Hilary Swank delivers another top performance with her portrayal of too perky cop Ellie, bored with the small-time crimes only to discover on an exciting case that her idol Al Pacino might not be the man she thought him to be.  The three characters have great chemistry amongst each other, ironically much more chemistry than Pacino with his character's partner Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan).On that rare occasion when eyes are off the main characters' dynamics, a good look reveals the beautiful cinematography.  The film was shot in Alaska and British Columbia, and the landscapes have a certain lush yet desolate feel that can't be found anywhere else.  It's also interesting because even in a setting with the sun out 24/7, Nolan finds a way to give pivotal scenes an apparent darkness reflecting the tone of the picture.  The never-ending sunlight also adds an eerie quality to scenes with Pacino walking around the town late at night.  With no other individuals around, but bright sunlight, it seems as though the world has ended (which, in a small town like that in the movie, when a high-profile murder occurs, it probably has).With excellent performances and cinematography, the only thing that slightly drags down ""Insomnia"" is its lack of a gimmick.  ""Memento"" was deemed revolutionary because it was cut backwards from end to beginning, which made the audience identify with its confused main character (once you knew what was going on, the movie was simply not as great as it was when you were as perplexed as its lead).  ""Following"" earned similar interest for another non-chronological editing gimmick.  Although parts of ""Insomnia"" do employ visual and audio distortion, these parts are few and far between. While there's nothing wrong with the film, the lack of an expected ""cutting-edge"" (no pun intended) gimmick throughout makes the film ever-so-slightly less interesting, especially as a remake.  It's still a very solid film that's worth watching, but it only has one real nail-biting moment and no real unexpected twists.  It's undoubtedly one of the best films of 2002, but it can't compare to other classic thrillers or even Nolan's own track record.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
cinematic school of the drooping eyelids...,"In ""Insomnia,"" director Christopher Nolan and his cinematographer have a knack for schizophrenic edits that disorient and surprise with regularity, putting a fine accent on an otherwise unspectacular police procedural with delusions of a deeper moral core (some aspects of which work quite well, to an extent). Los Angeles detective Will Dormer (an appropriately somnambulant Al Pacino) is sent to the small city of Nightmute, Alaska to investigate the murder of a young girl, but accidentally shoots his partner while in pursuit of the murder suspect; throughout the rest of the movie, Dormer is racked with guilt (which reveals another transgression years before) and is unable to sleep. He forges a bond with the girl's murderer, an author played with a too-controlled earnestness by Robin Willaims (whose dark side was displayed much better in ""One Hour Photo""), and these two actually wind up showing a multi-layered morality and depth that is mature and endearing. However, too many unnecessary plot threads run through ""Insomnia,"" and the script frequently resorts to repetition to pad things out (and at nearly two hours, the movie is already overlong)details about different guns and bullets and who possesses what winds up less clever than confusing; similarly, a boyfriend character is given little personality and just serves as a convenient plot device to take the killers' fall when the third act rolls around. And, after a fairly satisfying buildup in its first half, ""Insomnia"" unravels the closer it comes to the endinstead of the action and suspense tightening, it becomes as lethargic as the sleepless Dormer, to the point where a shootout ending is inserted (which, despite some subtle closing irony, pretty much jettisons the pains the film took to be cerebral) to wrap up the plot in a crowd-pleasing way. Removing the fog of amazement many critics had toward Nolan's ""Memento,"" ""Insomnia"" is a sophomore effort that's rather thin beneath the surfacea cinema stunt that too infrequently rises above convention.5.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Good, but not great","Perhaps it was the old lady sitting next to me with the heavy lilac perfume or perhaps it was the clods sitting behind me talking through the whole thing, but I found myself wishing that this movie would just get over already.  It seemed a little too long and not quite as interesting as I had hoped that it would be.The intriguing part of it was the question of  ""crossing the line"" and how justifiable it is.  I think that this aspect could have been better written with a lot more mystery as to Al Pacino's motivations.  Was he really going along with the killer or did he have something more up his sleeve as far as entrapment?Pacino was great as always, he was very subtle, expressing himself with just a smile or a one-liner.  Robin Williams held his own and Hillary Swank was just terrific and very believable in her supporting role as a rookie cop.All in all, I think that this movie had potential, but the storyline could have been even better, so I gave it only a 6.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Dream Duo,"I had a dream that eventually came true: seeing Pacino in the same film as Robin Williams, and not any movie, but a film in which their characters will clash. Two astounding, breathtaking, stucking to your seat performances, especially Robin Williams in a most unexpected but terrific role, quite different but as exceptional as ONE HOUR PHOTO, far far from GOOD MORNING VIETNAM or DEAD POETS SOCIETY. I don't think that this movie has the Chris Nolan's trademark, it still remains understandable, easy to follow, without too much complexity, unlike most of his other features; with maybe the exception of DUNKIRK and DARK KNIGHT trilogy.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good but nothing special,"Don't get me wrong, this is an entertaining crime film with great characters and tremendous acting.

The best-of of Al Pacino,"I've just had the DVD this week end, and I couldn't help it, I saw the film at least 5 times... This is the best film I saw from Al, the film title Insomnia reflects exactly the state of the actor... Pacino leads an inquiry on a brutal death of a teenager, in a lost town in Alaska. while chasing the criminal(Williams), he accidentally kills his partner, and make of Williams the author of this accident... It's then the debut of a long insomnia in a country where the sun never sets... Natural landscapes of Alaska serve remarkably the story. However, it's difficult to talk about Insomnia without mentioning the psychological idea of intrigue. The movie deals mainly with one question: How to live with the sentiment of guilt? till when a lie can possess you? Nolan answers it with the parts related to sleep in the movie.I particularly loved the performance of Pacino in this movie, it was in one word amazing, during all the movie you could notice the fatigue on his face... he was like someone who really suffers from insomnia.I recommend this movie to everyone who haven't seen it, and especially for those who liked ""Memento""...",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Same old, same old","Someone forgot to warn seasoned detective Al Pacino that the sun never sets in most parts of Alaska at that time of year, and as result, the poor guy doesn't sleep a wink during the entire movie. The poor audience has to endure director Christpher Nolan's hyper-style version of the effect sleeplessness has on the most attention sensitive of minds.That's right, Pacino is the cop of cops in this boring and a sadly typical cop movie. But its not the buddy-cop version, that would be too much just one month after ""Showtime!."" Instead of a mismatched partner, Pacino has one he genuinely likes as a person, which means he won't live that long, and he doesn't. Insomnia's twist is Pacino shoots him, and lies about it.See, the two of them are called from LA (where all good cops come from . . . or . . . wait . . . ) when a seventeen year old is brutally murdered and naturally, the local police are baffled because no one ever kills anyone in Alaska. While on a stakeout, Pacino runs after the killer (an effectively creepy and all too convincing Robin Williams) through fog that appears out of no where thats so thick poor Al can't see three feet, and the second he sees anything moving, BAM! Direct Hit! And wouldn't you know the luck? Robin Williams sees everything.And if you had just beaten a high school to death AND starred Bi-Centennial Man, you'd try to get away with it, too. So he blackmails Pacino, convincing him to help pin the murder on the girl's boyfriend; most of those silly Alaskan cops think he did it anyway. And Williams is incredibly effective as the soft-spoken and rational Walter Finch, who writes novels when he's not killing people or seducing jailbait. He's always calm, and he knows Pacino too well, probably because he writes about cliche detective work that Pacino is given to work with.But there are nice touches. The first few scenes show blood falling on a cuff, and someone vigorously trying to remove those tiny spots. Throughout the film we're treated to super-duper close-ups of that blood soaking into the fabic and staining it; as are those same stains on our characters and consciences when we've comprosmised morality. My gripe with ""Insomnia"" is that here we have ANOTHER cop movie about cop morals (Los Angelas cop morals, to boot!) and the line between right and wrong.Don't other people in our great and diverse society question their morals who AREN'T cops and attorneys? Do you have to ride the line everyday to be interesting or what?",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Dark despite its light scenes,"Watching first later Nolan movies, it's easy to see a decreasing amount of intensity of adult content. Warning: not sexual content, to violent and intense content. Memento was very intense, this, the next Nolan movie, is way less intense, though far higher in intensity than what you see in the dark knight trilogy.I don't know what was the original movie like, but this movie certainly was not bad. Direction managed just as in memento to bring the viewer into the character's perspective, Al Pacino acted very well, just as Robin Williams in his unusually really dark role. Visuals were very good as well, with some stunning Alaskan views.just as I said in Memento, content of this film is quite intense. To compare with other movies from Nolan, on a 1 to 100 scale: Memento is 100, Batman Begins around 30-40, Inception 35, The Dark knight 40-50, Interstellar 10, and Insomnia is a 80-90. Not that much for the amount of gore, more for the way that minimal is depicted, and how a gruesome murder is described towards the end. These two give a high-level of intensity to the movie.

What if they had chosen De Niro or Edward Norton to play the role of Finch?,"Before I wanted to write a review, I didn't know it yet, but apparently this movie is a remake of a Norwegian movie, made 5 years earlier. That's something I don't really understand about Hollywood: Why do they always have to make remakes of European and Asian movies? Is it because they can't bare the thought that someone else might have come up with an idea for a movie that actually worked or is it because they believe that no-one will have seen the original version and therefor will believe that the remake is actually an original movie? I don't know, but I find it quite sad actually. Still, if it is a good movie, I can see past that...The story is situated in Alaska this time. When Detective Will Dormer is sent from the city to investigate the murder of a teenage girl in a small Alaskan town, he accidentally shoots his own partner while trying to apprehend a suspect. But instead of admitting that he shot the man, he uses an unexpected alibi. But that doesn't make it easier for him, it only adds to his guilt and makes it almost impossible for him to cope with his emotions. Add to this the fact that he can't sleep because of the midnight sun, the murder case that needs to be solved, the investigation that has been opened against him, some blackmail and framing of an innocent bystander, orchestrated by the man they were chasing and you know that it is all getting much too big to handle for one man...I can't say that I had ever heard of Nikolaj Frobenius or Erik Skjoldbjærg before, but they sure know how to write an interesting script. The story is nice and there are enough twists to keep you guessing until the end about who actually did it and once you know that, why he did it. But if I had been the director of this movie I would have chosen another actor for the role of Walter Finch. What Robin Williams did with it, certainly wasn't bad, but I believe that a man like Robert De Niro or even Edward Norton might have been better for the role. Somehow I don't see Williams as a man capable of what he does in this movie. Still, that doesn't mean that the quality of the movie is low or even average. No, this is definitely an enjoyable thriller that offers some very good acting, beautiful decors, a good story... I liked it all and that's why I give this movie a 7/10, maybe even a 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

My date and I agreed that there is a *purpose* for Insomnia, however, as it could truly put the audience to sleep! Watching Al Pacino go day after day without sleep and nodding in and out of consciousness, we found ourselves also doing just that.  The gunshots towards the end, however, served to jerk the audience awake. I was very eager to see this movie as the trailers seemed to offer so much more.

An Anemic Remake,"I don't know why Christopher Nolan bothered to do a remake of the original Insomnia, a Norwegian film about a morally ambivalent investigating detective, whose pragmatism made him an effective investigator, but also a little unprincipled.  Brilliantly portrayed by Jonas Engström, the Norse version draws the viewer into the ethical relativism of the esteemed sleuth. It's a riveting performance.On the trail of a child murderer, he makes a mistake, shooting his partner, friend, and long-time colleague by accident while chasing the killer in a thick fog.  None of the police witnessed it, so he covers it up by saying that the killer did it.  One can understand the reasoning:  it was an honest mistake;  and, the murderer is ultimately responsible, anyway.  The detective creates a cover story for one simple reason:  he's embarrassed. He could have easily told the truth, and it probably wouldn't have harmed him;  but, in a moment of panic and discomposure, he lies, creating a plausible cover story, making it more difficult with every succeeding lie to come clean.  It's believable.  Not knowing that the accidental homicide was witnessed by the murderer, the tangled web he weaves starts becoming his own personal spider web, himself the captured fly.The American version, by contrast, is much less interesting.  Why? There's no moral ambivalence.  In the American version, Will Dormer's moral dilemma is the same old crap about ends justifying the means.  It's like taking a melody played gently on a flute, and blaring it out all gaudy and loud on a mighty Wurlitzer.  It's not as convincing as the original film, because it moral subtlety that made the original so compelling.  We sit there and say, `that's wrong,' instead of sitting on the edge of our seats and saying, `it may be wrong, but it's understandable.'  The ethical pragmatism of the investigating detective in the original is what gave it its edge, its grit, its dramatic tension, its cachet.  Toward the end of the remake, I started to feel as drowsy as the sleepless detective.If you want to see Insomnia, rent the original version, not its eviscerated copy.",,Anonymous,Mystery
A much different Nolan film,"When looking at Nolan's filmography you see this one is very different compared to his future and past two films. Instead of writing and directing this time around Nolan is just directing. Proving he is just as good at coming up with original material as he is a studio director. I have no doubt it's his direction of this film that lead him to being offered Batman Begins.Insomnia is a great drama, mystery, thriller with great cinematography, a solid score, and great performances from Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and Hilary Swank. This film has a way of really weighing on you and Pacino's performance of a cop who is strung out from stress and lack of sleep convey all that weight very well. Plus watching it on no sleep makes it that much more trippy as I felt the lack of sleep Dormer was feeling.This is one of Nolan's most straight forward films but still has that Nolan touch, look, feel, and twist. In the end this film has convinced me that I will never visit Alaska.Next up in Nolan marathon Batman Begins -IMDb: 8/10

Not by Al Pacino however, who is very overestimated and has been playing nearly the same role through his whole career (one is rather tired of him), but by Hilary Swank and Robin Williams. After seeing Swank in ""Boys don't cry"" you will always have high demands on her, but Williams is surprisingly enough forming a complicated character here, which wasn't to be expected.A little too much shooting in the end.

Well Made Thriller,"I think overall Insomnia was a well made film. It had a great cast, Al Pacino was great and Robin Williams was outstanding as the villain. The cinematography by Wally Pfister was gorgeous and the directing was sublime. Throughout the movie there was always a dark tone even though the actual town that it was set was always in daytime. David Julyan's score gives an operatic sense to the film which in addition to great acting and low key lighting creates a dark feel to the film. I think in my opinion Robin Williams should have at least been nominated for the best supporting actor Oscar. Overall Christopher Nolan has made a dark, gripping movie with a great cast and beautiful Cinematography.9/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Tantalizing!,"I don't particularly care for Pacino. I have always thought of him as a one dimensional actor (same facial expressions, same voice intonation, mannerisms, etc).Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised with his performance in Insomnia.  The movie will most certainly keep you awake, due in part to Pacino himself. His character (Will Dormer)played to his strengths.  The ""Twin Peaks"" meets ""just-about-any-other-thriller story line"", allows Pacino to personify the essence of what Insomnia is all about.  Swank and Williams complement Pacino both literally and figuratively.I have not seen the original Swedish production but Nolan wasted no time in giving his ""Insomnia"" a distinct  touch, very early on.Insomnia will not set the Box Office on fire but will impress thrill seekers and all Pacino fans.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""A good cop can't sleep because he's missing a piece of the puzzle. And a bad cop can't sleep because his conscience won't let him.""","Nolan seems like he's a director who can do no wrong. Every film he's done has been a unique work with beautiful directing and complex scripting constantly trying to be different. Insomnia is no exception demonstrating once again why Nolan is one of the masters of modern cinema.Al Pacino leads as the veteran cop who is sent to an isolated town to investigate a child's murder with his partner. During this he is under investigation from internal affairs who his partner may be cooperating with. The pressure of this begins to take hold as the case goes on, trying to hide all his secrets.Whilst it was not written by Nolan, it is a story well suited for him to handle. Just like any Nolan film, it tackles meaningful themes of morality and guilt throughout with Pacino's veteran cop becoming conflicted on his own beliefs.Once again Pacino demonstrates why he is one of the best actors, with his character becoming more worn down as the film goes on. The look of his eyes alone show how exhausted he is and that the lies have taken his life away.Though as impressive as Pacino was, Williams is probably the biggest surprise of the film giving a chilling portrait of a serial killer who steals the show whenever he's on screen. It's very different to his usual role, but he plays it incredibly with an eerily calm demeanour and incredible dialogue delivery giving a memorable portrait of a killer.The killer works as an effective reflection of the veteran cop for both of them are trying to hide their own lies. The only difference being that whilst Pacino feels guilt for his lies and actions, the killer feels none.Insomnia is a masterpiece in filmmaking from start to finish. The directing, performances and writing come together with everyone involved in the film giving it their A game.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Gripping crime drama,"Reviewed by Martin Davis, Retrospect Film on Facebook. Having directed the critically acclaimed and commercially successful 'Memento' and before his hugely impressive relaunching of the Batman franchise, Christopher Nolan directed this tense and gripping crime drama. A remake of the 1997 Norwegian film of the same name, 'Insomnia' sees world weary LAPD detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and his partner Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) assigned to investigate the murder of a teenage girl in a small Alaskan town. Early in the film we learn Dormer and Eckhart are themselves under investigation by Internal Affairs. Much to Dormers frustration, Eckhart confesses he has agreed to an immunity deal if he testifies against one of his partners past cases. With tensions running high between the two, a trap is laid for the girls killer. When Dormer accidentally shoots and kills his colleague as they stake out and then give chase to their suspect in the Alaskan fog the only witness is the suspect himself. Dormer knows whilst he is under investigation the accidental killing of his colleague will come under scrutiny and blames the escaped suspect. The scene is set for a riveting game of cat and mouse between the detective and the, as yet, unknown killer. Over the next few days Dormer is unable to sleep due to the guilt of shooting Eckhart and the perpetual Alaskan daylight. Growing increasingly paranoid and hallucinating, he then starts to receive anonymous phone calls from the man he is searching for. Dormer eventually finds him, an author living in a nearby town named Walter Finch, played in fine understated form by the late Robin Williams. There is to be no straightforward arrest though. Both men harbour terrible secrets about each other. Meanwhile, an ambitious young local cop, Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank) is starting to put the pieces together about the killing in the fog and to realise all is not as it seems. The net is starting to close in on both the hunted and the hunter. Much less your standard cop hunts killer crime film and more an enthralling psychological drama 'Insomnia', amongst others, confirms Nolan as one of the best modern filmmakers. With excellent performances by Pacino, Williams and Swank and cinematography that captures perfectly the bleak Alaskan landscape 'Insomnia' is not to be missed.

Disappointing,"Perhaps I don't appreciate the subtleties of the script/plot here, but aside from the excellent photography and location work (mostly in Canada), this so-called thriller is a painfully drawn-out, burdensomely chatty, overly psychological story which is devoid of mystery and thrills.Conversely, I stayed with it just to find out the resolution.Al Pacino's performance is one of meticulous control, showing his character's psychological torment, but he becomes progressively tiresome and reminds one very much of Robert Mitchum's dead-pan style of acting.Robin William's performance is also one of considerable restraint, but yet again, this epitomises the stifled, inflexible style of the whole film.A mind-numbingly executed story, with no dazzling fluctuations in pace. Not recommended.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Really great thriller with unforgettable acting,"Insomnia might be considered as one of the few commercial thrillers from the past 10 years, but of course that doesn't necessary mean it's not good. In fact, it's really great. I don't quite know what I liked so much, but when I think about it, I really loved it. After the movie ended, I thought it's nothing special, but it's something I would recommend. Well, I guess I have seen some bad thrillers lately and I appreciate what Insomnia showed me.We have a story about a detective investigating a murder among the woods of a small city. Very few citizens and nobody could suspect anything bad could happen. One day, Will Dormer played by Al Pacino, along with his colleagues are in action, trying to catch the killer. The is a fog and Will is completely alone when he sees a man with a gun pointed at him. He shoots him, thinking it's the suspect, but it turns out that it's another one of his colleagues. Nobody finds out about this and Will starts living in fear, keeping that secret. And the most important is that the real killer saw Will killing his friend and now Will could do nothing except waiting, helping the killer in what he needs. His life becomes a nightmare.Well, it's a nice plot. There is a drama element in the movie that you would probably like. It kinda fits with the story, the atmosphere and the location where the movie takes place. Dark, lonely place with a bad mood atmosphere surrounding it. Somehow you could not have a straight thriller or a satire. It just cries for drama. And if we add that Pacino's character has had bad life and he lives in a nightmare, the pessimism takes place and you understand the movie is not what you thought it would be. After the first half an hour, the movie becomes more of a character study then a crime - thriller with great twists and tension. And since I put SPOILERS, I would allow myself to tell you that the killer in fact appears on screen 40-50 minutes before the end. It's kinda Se7en style, but with different plot purposes. This time Walter Finch played by Robbin Williams, is a cheater, a cold blood murderer and kinda eccentric and sly person. At least enough sly and clever to rule Pacino's character. At least I did have expectation for a tensed thriller with a twist, but as I said it became a character study which is kinda provocative and it explains why Insomnia has some haters. I personally liked it. I guess Pacino played his role in a great way, so there was no way I could have been disappointed. And the bottom line is that it actually turns out that I loved the character study factor, cause of Pacino's great performance. I don't see anything wrong with it, but some people do. In this particular case, it depends on what are your expectation before viewing Insomnia.I want to point out that Williams as the killer, was ridiculous. This is a thing I hated. He is not believable at all. His facial is funny even when he tries to be deranged psychopath. Acting is indeed great as I said many times already, but that was one of the worst cast choices ever. Of course we have great Swank performance which for me is the best actress alive these days, we have Pacino with a great performance as the unhappy, pessimistic looking detective and some nice performances by not that know performers. The director Christopher Nolan, perfectly know with Memento, does his job. I just thought that there might be people who are ready to view Insomnia, immediately after they are told it's from Memento's director. Final words - highly recommended fresh and original drama - thriller with different and casual plot moments and superb acting.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A good cop can't sleep because he's missing a piece of the puzzle. And a bad cop cant sleep because his conscience wont let him.,"Insomnia is directed by Christopher Nolan and written by Erik Skjoldbjærg and Nikolaj Frobenius (1997 screenplay). It stars Al Pacino, Robin Williams, Hilary Swank, Maura Tierney, Martin Donovan and Nicky Katt. Music is scored by David Julyan and cinematography by Wally Pfister. It's a remake of a 1997 Norwegian film of the same name.LAPD detective Will Dormer (Pacino) and his partner Hap Eckhart (Donovan) travel to the remote Alaskan town of Nightmute to aid the local cops investigating the savage murder of a teenage girl. But Dormer leaves behind an Internal Affairs Investigation that gnaws away at him, and when a potential bust of the murder suspect goes tragically wrong, his conscious gets attacked on two fronts. By lack of sleep and by the killer himself.It's a House of Cards.Viewing from afar it's easy to be cynical and suggest that Insomnia is just an American remake cash in. Bigger budget, bigger stars and directed by an indie darling of the critics moving into the big league. While on the surface the plot looks to be another in a long line of cops and villains thrillers where procedural unfolds and evil is ultimately brought down at the end. Yet Insomnia is so much more than that, it's a deep movie dealing in complex psychological issues, a blanc-noir of some character substance, a picture clinically put together around one mans descent into a private hell, with the beautiful Alaskan backdrop perversely claustrophobic and Anthony Mann like in being at one with Will Dormer's fragmented state of mind.Killing changes you. You know that.From the opening moments as we observe a biplane flying over the Alaskan glaciers, accompanied by David Julyan's nerve tingling score, there's a looming air of disquiet. Nolan knows his noir onions, mood is everything and the dense psychological atmosphere is never once breached for the entire movie. Much of the picture is dialogue heavy, gratifyingly so, with the hushed conversations between Pacino and Williams begging the viewer to hang on every word as cop and killer (no spoiler, it's revealed to us early as a necessity) jostle for control of each others soul. What action there is also comes with a side order of otherworldly delights, a chase across floating logs and a stalk through eerie fog being the two particular highlights.Sleep comes at a cost.With three Oscar winners in the cast Nolan had some serious quality to direct, that Pacino, Williams and Swank deliver excellence is high praise for the British director. Pacino actually gives one of his finest late career performances, utterly compelling as Dormer, his haggard face tells of a thousand sorrows, his sleep deprived gait befits a man staring into the abyss. Wally Pfister's photography is on the money, the blend of snow whites and green tinges sparkle from the vistas and the soft brown hues inside the hotel provide the rare moments of tranquillity available to Will Dormer.

Amazing acting along with a different story.,I loved Memento. But that doesnt mean I was necessarily going to like Insomnia. The thing you need to expect when you go into Memento is a mind trip.

Interesting meld of Stars' typecasting,"I was fortunate enough to see this as a premiere in Halifax last night.Those of you expecting Memento Revisited - lower your expectations. Ultimately, this is a nice film noir mystery - where the mystery lies not in Whodunit? but rather in Whatshegonnado?Pacino's role is a recap of his Serpico role - but this time with a far more selfish twist, as he slips into series of bad decisions resulting from some serious sleep deprivation.  Williams' role as Finch is simply his gentle academic (see Good Will Hunting and Awakenings) turned desperate.Perpetually illuminated, this drama is character driven and intriguing as a study of the motivations within us.Find yourself in a quandry - you never know how you'll react - and that's the question you'll be asking yourself as you walk out -- How would I handle these situations?",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Good but not captivating,"Insomnia is director Christopher Nolan's follow up to Memento. It's not as good as his previous film but it's not bad. The film begins with Al Pacino's character, a cop from L.A., going to Alaska to investigate a murder. He arrives with another cop from Los Angeles. The film immediately spins into a routine serial killer movie with Al Pacino discovering info that the Alaskan cops had no knowledge of. The first 30 minutes of the movie are really, really boring. Suddenly, Robin Williams shows up and the movie takes off. Williams is perfect in this role and surprisingly he's completely serious. Once Williams comes on the screen, the film becomes more than just a normal serial killer movie with a few minor twists and some good original ideas. Hillary Swank plays one of the Alaskan cops and she's just plain out of place in this movie. It's not that she does a bad acting job but she just doesn't fit. As for Christopher Nolan, he does a decent but not award worthy job in the director's chair. With some wild editing, this film does bear some resemblance to Memento but not much. This film is much less confusing and also not as stylish. Overall, it's a good serial killer movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Won't Let You Sleep,"This strong psychological thriller drama will not let you sleep. It is intelligent, well-acted and well directed. No wonder that this is a re-make of an European film - they do too little good scripts in Hollywood nowadays. The European public is much more connected to literature, and the lack of big apes and aliens encourages script-writers in Europe to focus more on humans.Acting is superb. Al Pacino is playing a deprived of sleep Columbo, with the emotional depth of a master. Robin Williams decided to break his stereotypes casting of the last years, and the decision seems to be already paying back. I expect more wonderful roles from him soon.The director Christopher Nolan takes a bet by picking a less revolutionary script than in his previous film 'Memento'. He succeeds and I actually liked 'Insomnia' more than 'Memento' - probably human feelings are easier to understand when run in the normal chronological order. It is hard to believe that he is only at his third film, he always has the self-confidence and sure hand of a master. As the titles of his films are all in the Hitchcock tradition, the comparison to the 'Birds' author is striking, and I really hope that the future will prove it as well-deserved.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sleep,"Another Nolan movie added to my list of good movies. This movie is packed with great actors like Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank. This story is about a detective investing a murder case in Alaska. The plot of the movie is really impressive. It's not just a simple thriller but a psychological drama thriller. It depicts the character of Al Pacino as an insomniac detective,Robin Williams as a manipulative writer and Hilary as a young detective.The character development of Robin's character was not so strong,which is the main downside of the movie.

Kay's body was found on the rocks by the lake naked with her neck broken.It doesn't take long for Det. Dormer to find a suspect in Kay's murder her on and off again boyfriend Randy Stetz, Jonathan Jackson, who's been known for working her over where she had black & blue marks to prove it. What confuses Dormer in Kay's murder is that it wasn't the crime of passion that he suspected it of being. It was cold and calculated in that her body was washed and her nails clipped as if she was being prepared for burial at a funeral home. Still in him thinking that Randy was Kay's killers leads Dormer his partner Eckhart and the local police to stake out this cabin where they think he hid all of Kay's clothes and personals as a trophy of his grizzly act.With the shadowy killer sensing he's abut to be caught he makes a run for in that in all the confusion Dormer ends up shooting,in the thick fog, his partner Eckhart,to death! Deciding to cover up the shooting Dormer plants evidence at the scene to implicate young Randy Stetz whom he felt was responsible for murdering Kay but didn't have the evidence to arrest or convict him!**SPOILER ALERT from This Point On** What Det.Dormer didn't realize was that Kay's killer local dime store novel detective & mystery writer Walter Finch,Robin Williams, was the one fleeing from the cabin and saw what Dormer did: Kill his partner Hep Eckhart. Finch whom Kay had a crush on murdered her when she rejected his crude and uncalled advances towards her. Now having something on Det.

Just like he's planning, with Finch's cooperation, to do in setting up young Randy Stetz! What really got to Det.Dormer more then anything else in the movie is the constant and non-stop daylight that after a number of days without sleep starts flipping him out. It's in fact local lady detective Ellie Burr, Hilary Swank, who's a big fan of his who later realizes that Dormer in fact blew Eckhart away by finding a spent shell casing at the scene of the shooting from the gun he had a Walther 9.mm not the one he planted a .38 revolver in Randy's house in order to frame him. With Dormer now suffering from severe sleep deprivation he decides to let the chips,or shell casing,fall where they may Finch decide to do him in to keep Dormer form turning him into the local police for Kay's murder!Wild stomach churning and gut crunching final with both Finch & Dormer having it out in Finch's cabin where he's holding Det.

And why shouldn't he by that time Dormer, who was bleeding to death, had nothing to lose and everything to gain. First by clearing his conscious in his crimes back in L.A and his killing his partner,by accident,Hap Eckhart! And most of all preventing Det.

"Not as good as ""Memento""","Actually, not close to ""Memento"" at all. I liked Al's performance, weary and with a week's worth of luggage underneath each eyeball, but Al, we need to do something with your hair. I found my concentration on Al's hair spoiled the movie for me. For one, it varied in colour a lot, salt and pepper, then more salt, then back to jet black, then teetering to a brownish red. And the hair pieces were another story, moving around his forehead in various degrees of thickness but mostly good matches for his vari-coloured hair. And he is getting a bit long in the tooth to believe the sprinting runs and underwater near-drowning scenes he has. The scenery was stunning. Hilary's performance was great as she slowly starts to understand what is really going on. Martin Donovan did not creep me out for once. The plot was great but suffered from the old cliches of senseless chasing and lots of shooting. It should have been more intellectual in concept but I guess we have to please the masses. And nobody can do weirdly awful like Robin Williams. What a gifted performer both in this and in One Hour Photo. 6 out of 10.

Robin Williams, who apparently strung himself thin, was in two movies that aren't going to make it very far...  this and Death to Smoochy.  Meanwhile, Al Pacino plays his overused character as it is...  overused.  The ""intrigue"" in the subplot is marginal, causing some of the extremely predictable scenes to drag even more with talk of internal affairs and some thingy with people in jail.  There's some teenage angst which is thrown in for the hell of it, and just general uninterestingness.  The insomnia scenes are also quite boring. So yeah.  It's a movie.

Pacino and Williams give good performances!,"For those of you who remember this film, as it came out it May, it stars Al Pacino and Robin Williams. It's the story of a detective (Pacino) who accidentally shoots his partner and kills him while pursuing a murder suspect (Williams) in a wooded area of Alaska, where the film takes place. Two things to point out here; the sun doesn't set during the time of year where this film takes place. Also, Pacino's character can't sleep because his conscience won't allow him to forget that he killed his partner, and that he blamed it on the murder suspect played by Robin Williams. It is note worthy to point out that this film does have some good performances by Robin Williams and Hillary Swank. And how can you go wrong casting Al Pacino; he's always good.  Also, Christopher Nolan directed this film. His other claim to fame was directing the critically hailed film, Memento starring Guy Pierce. My one qualm with this film, as with other films of this year, was the fact that it was a remake of a 1997 Norwegian film of the same title. It just seems that Hollywood doesn't have too many original ideas up it's sleeve and the really good stuff is actually coming from the other side of the world now.

Robin as a bad guy is really convincing. The more the film advances, the more it's become tense, because Al has to do much planning for his version while fighting insomnia makes him being very sloppy.

He's so tired he can't sleep,"""Insomnia"" is a story about a cop (Will Dormer-played by Al Pacino) sent to Alaska to help a friend solve the grizzly murder of a local teenage girl. Dormer amazes the locals, most notably young cop Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank) and Fred (Nicky Katt) with his unorthodox methods. Dormer organises a set-up and what should be a routine capture of the main suspect goes horribly wrong when Dormer shoots his partner (Martin Donovan). Dormer covers up the unseen accidental shooting, but things get complicated when the prime suspect (Walter Finch- played by Robin Williams in his creepiest role since ""Mrs Doubtfire"") sees what happened. Finch tries to broker a deal to get himself in the clear, and a game of trickery unfolds.Not a heart racer, but certainly suspenseful and worth a watch.

To make matters even worse, the killer Walter Finch (Williams) witnesses Dormer kill his partner and the two men begin trying to avoid prosecution and jailtime.Al Pacino is once again playing the role of a detective, I think he first played detective in the 1995 movie Heat, a classic crime movie about some bank robbers. His performance in this movie is excellent as well as that of Robin Williams.If you're watching Insomnia and you're a RW fan, you should watch One Hour Photo, it's another movie which released in 2002 and Williams' comes off as a lonely guy with a kind personality, but he becomes deranged and stalks a family.The man has made some great movies and it's sad that he's no longer with us, R.

"This is a good one to watch on January 3rd, when Alaska became a state in 1959","Insomnia affects millions of people every day. Not being able to sleep hardly ever must really suck. In the great state of Alaska, during parts of the summer, the sun is out for almost a full 24 hours a day. Seeing the Sun at ten o'clock at night? That would drive anybody to do something that makes no sense. Having to try and sleep, while the sun is out, for an entire day. A person gets dizzy just thinking about it, so you probably already can tell how insomnia could make life very stressful for someone, who has to deal with these conditions all the time. Most people know how bad they feel when they don't get enough sleep. Most people know how difficult it is to sleep when it isn't dark. Most people are used to night and day. We also know what it feels like to be extremely exhausted. Being relentlessly tired creates a level of depression that makes people sick.This film is a remake of a 1997 Norwegian film. In Insomnia (1997), the film takes place in the Norwegian Arctic. In that part of the world, they too have to deal with days when the sun is out for a full 24 hours. In the case of this American remake, it seemed appropriate for the writers to move the location to Alaska. After his directorial debut in a quiet, critically acclaimed independent film called Following (1998), Christopher Nolan hit pay dirt with his cult-classic masterpiece Memento (2000). After doing a film like that, it was a no-brainer that his next film would be very intriguing. Insomnia (2002), would be Nolan's third feature film. Complete with a huge budget, amazing locations and a big cast, Nolan would direct a great crime-drama that involves murder and a major lack of sleep.In the town of Nightmute, Alaska a teenage girl is murdered and Al Pacino's seasoned, LAPD detective, Will Lormer, is sent in to help solve the crime. Hillary Swank plays Ellie, a local police officer, who considers Will a mentor of sorts. Throughout the movie, especially in the early parts of the film, there is this established connection between Swank and Pacino. It caters along the lines of a teacher-student relationship. It is a professional relationship. One that shows the respect she has for the legendary Lormer. In a humorous moment in the film when the two are getting to know each other, Ellie says to Lormer, ""A good cop can't sleep, because he's missing a piece of the puzzle. And a bad cop can't sleep, because his conscience won't let him. You said that Detective"", which Lormer responds chuckling jovially with, ""Yeah, that sounds like something I would say"". This is the moment where Pacino's character embraces his legendary status that this young woman has bestowed on him. It establishes the feeling and mood surrounding the relationship the ""good guys"" have in the first half of the film. It shows that the ""legend"" has a good sense of humor, it humanizes all the characters and sets things up for the thrill ride ahead.In Insomnia (1997), the ""Lormer"" character is trying to distance himself from his old job in Sweden, where he was caught tampering with a case, because he slept with the main witness in the case. Pacino's version has him in an Internal Affairs investigation. He and his partner, Detective Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan), are being investigated and Hap tells Will he will turn over evidence against Will, even if it means many horrible criminals back in Los Angeles, may be set free. A tragedy strikes in Nightmute, which creates a new case that Ellie has to deal with, while Lormer continues the search for the serial killer. Ellie eventually becomes suspicious of Will, when the serial killer, played by the late, great, Robin Williams begins pulling Will further into the madness as the insomnia begins to take its toll.This film is a huge departure for Robin Williams. He was always a student and scholar of comedy, but did do some serious roles. He handles the subject matter in this film very well, channeling his energy into making his character as creepy and as sympathetic as possible. Both Nolan and Williams manage to make us believe this sick man could do this serious crime. Pacino is so good at showing how tired he is. I was wondering, through the whole shooting of this film, if Pacino actually didn't sleep for this role. It is amazing to see. As the film rolls along you see him losing himself. Pacino is another one of those great actors who can speak volumes with just his facial expressions. He has totally mastered his craft by now and it is that professionalism and seasoned veteran thespianism that makes his performance so amazing. Nolan's inter-cutting close up shots of things in the scene, mixed in with flashback edits, help the audience understand the power of insomnia. Combining Nolan's edgy storytelling with mesmerizing location scenes, along with a story with mood and an eerie atmosphere and you have a making of a nice piece of art. It is gritty in its make-up, human in its characters and completely shows that the main ingredient in this film is the ever-present feeling of guilt.8.7 (B+ Mygrade) = 8 IMDB.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I respect Al Pacino. I support Robin Williams, especially in his dramatic endeavors. I don't like Hilary Swank, but that's a small matter. I have a lukewarm attitude toward director Christopher Nolan. But for some time I really liked the film 'Insomnia'. Until I got acquainted with the original - a Norwegian film under the same name, it seems, released in 1999.Yes, the American film is professionally tailored. Well played. Its disadvantages are visible only if you know how it could have been (and it was!). And it was: brilliant.Al Pacino overacts. He goes out of his way to try to prove to the viewer how much he wants to sleep. During the entire film, the Swedish actor not only didn't yawn once, but he himself seemed to have no idea that he wasn't getting enough sleep. And at the same time, his fatigue poured off the screen. How? A miracle, probably. In the Norwegian original, the main character is not a hero at all. Pacino again released a caricatured brave comic, a man of honor and conscience. And the scriptwriters conceived of him as an ordinary person, quite unpleasant by the way, with human emotions and shortcomings.Robin Williams is the most organic. Although again, one cannot help but notice some of the grotesqueness of his character. He plays the villain. He is obsessively unpleasant. Purely Hollywood approach - 'good character' versus 'bad character'. And God forbid the viewer confuses them.The ending absolutely killed me. In ""Insomnia"" 2002, she aroused distrust in me for a long time. But now I know for certain that nothing like this was expected.In 2002's Insomnia, there is a sense of a great idea that falls apart as the film progresses, and by the end there is no trace of it left at all.

A great cure for insomnia,"The summary comes courtesy of my husband, although I'm sure other people must have made the same comment about this mogadon-fuelled thriller.I was expecting something edgier and unpredictable from the director of 'Momento', but it seems that he literally lost the plot this time. What begins as a beautifully photographed and intriguing film descends into a saggy and oddly edited disappointment which seemed to go on far longer than its 2-ish hours. This time there are no plot innovations, just annoying edits to represent Dormer's (Al Pacino) symptoms of prolonged insomnia.And, oh dear, Mr Pacino's been hanging out at the Theatre of Pain again and traded in his 'Heat' subtleties for a ""from the buttocks"" 'Scent of a Woman'-style performance. He's 62, looks ten years' older but we're supposed to believe that - not only is he still employed - he can scale fences and chase villains - albeit at a sleepwalker's pace.And please don't get me started with Robin Williams! Having obviously made the winning bid at the recent ""Roles to give gravitas to Failing Comics"" auction, Robin pulls out all the stops (which includes wearing corduroy!) to convince us that he CAN do 'serious'. The problem is he can't.In taking the role of the bushy-tailed rooky, Hilary Swank has taken three steps back in her acting career, like 'Boys Don't Cry' never happened.

Garbage,"Insomnia is boring, badly scripted, badly acted, melodramatic trash. Al Pacino plays a detective with some phony non-italian name which doesn't suit him, who has arrived in some beautiful Alaskan village to solve a murder. Yes that famous, emotional don corleone (its tough being a rich mafioso) is back better than ever as an emotional cop. I don't know what was more irritating, Pacino's huge sacks of age under his eyes, or the sophomoric script he's reading from. Hillary Swank also appears, playing a fighto woman cop ready to solve the case reminding me of some second rate Nancy Drew, which funny enough, was mentioned in the film. Her acting was amateurish, and i'm sure she was trained by the best or whatever kind of shit they can give an oscar winning actress. i remember her from buffy the vampire slayer, in which she seemed more relaxed and less like someone trying to be a ""good"" actress. Robin Williams in a dramatic role just doesn't work. Finally, the director. This memento man, who does wonders with the camera. well, i was wondering what exactly that is. i've seen the following and memento: both shit. and now this...what's the big deal? Is it his filters? his lighting? i can't imagine it being his ability to direct actors because this film exemplifies bad direction of the actors. its not that hard to film a beautiful image, especially in this film's case in beautiful icy alaska. Christopher Nolan is no great director. Just watch this film, and you'll see. He's just an excuse for ""film buffs"" to say ""gee, that's great art.""

Great Acting - Average Plot.,"Evidently this film is a Remake. I didn't know it. And I'm betting that the director of this film, Christopher Nolan (Memento), is banking that most Americans are like me; oblivious to the history of the film.Memento was a very original film which won over the critics, but unfortunately didn't fair well with mainstream America at the box office. Memento found its audience on pay per view and as a video and DVD. It is now a cult classic with educated movie fans and film students. There are a lot of folks who now WISH they would have seen the flick on the big screen. Hind sight you know.I mention all this because Christopher Nolan is a smart man, who probably wants a long movie career. Very few directors experience the level of critical success on what was only their second major movie ever. So here is Nolan, on the crossroads. He's won the minds of Americans (the critics, cultural elite, etc) now he has to win over the hearts of Americans. How, by making a relatively safe film that is accessible to most Americans.What's more ""American"" than Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and serial killers? Not much.Insomnia is a good film. But it's a safe and predictable film. It's also a very commercial film, unlike Nolan's previous 2 creations. He's proven to the studios that he can make art, now he has proved that he can make money.It's your standard cops and robbers flick, but what makes the film stand out are the actors. Who would have thought that Robin Williams would succeed in his role as a very convincing killer?  He did a very good job which is almost worth the ticket price alone. And Al Pacino... man, they made him look 20 pounds too heavy and 30 years older--on purpose. He's supposed to be ragged looking and they do a great job. You can sum up the film as great actors, do great jobs in an average script. They did so well, that it saves the film. Anyone else, and this film would have fallen flat on its face because only the acting, and not the directing, kept it afloat.It's a slow film, not an action flick. But it is suspenseful. It gets a 8 out of 10 from me.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Could have been better,"Maybe I just expected too much from this movie, after heaving read a positive review in a magazine about it recently. Al Pacino performs very well; the role of the cop simply fits him , yet INSOMNIA is probably not the movie he will be remembered for later. However, I had some difficulties watching Robin Williams as the bad guy, he always gave me the feeling like there is a slight smile on his face. This might happen if you have watched too many comedies with him before. The story is good, just the ending is rather poor, but watch yourself.07/10 (because of the bad ending, else 8)",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Twin Peaks meets The Pledge,"I've seen the original Norwegian version of Insomnia, and for once I really don't feel that the American remake ""ruined"" the original.  Nolan's Insomnia is a considerably different movie despite following the plot outline of the original quite closely.  Nolan and his screenwriter add more narrative elements--twists and complications--and provide more backstory, a significant departure from the sparse plot of the European film--that's to be expected from a Hollywood production, I think.  But I was pleasantly surprised to see that Nolan's version keeps intact the moral complexity of the film's main characters--American movies generally exhibit a somewhat Puritanical discomfort with moral ambiguity, but Nolan doesn't seem to submit to that pattern.All in all, I enjoyed the new Insomnia very much, although I had to force myself to stop being an anti-remake snob and just appreciate it for itself. If you really liked the new Insomnia, I do recommend watching the original, just to see how the same story is rendered by a different creative team for a different audience.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

There were some annoying plot flaws but the acting of Pacino, Williams and Swank helped make this a strong movie and one worth seeing.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Once is not enough,"Christopher Nolan's ""Insomnia"" is so good, so full of intriguing detail, that I found it even more enjoyable on second viewing than on the first. The direction is first-rate, and the acting is generally better than good. The really good news about ""Insomnia"" is that it's at least as good as, and arguably better than, the original film on which it's based. This isn't always the case when Hollywood re-makes a ""foreign-language"" film for the big screen and the big names.There are several good reasons for the artistic success of ""Insomnia"" (2002). First, is the choice of Christopher Nolan as director. The man really does know how to use his camera and his actors: clearly, his ""Memento"" of two years ago was no flash-in-the-pan success. Another reason for the film's success is that the screenplay was written by Nikolaj Frobenius and Erik Skjoldbjærg, who also wrote the 1997 Norwegian original. (Skjoldbjærg also directed the original.)Although the two versions of ""Insomnia"" are different in many ways, the basic plot outline is the same. A young woman is murdered, her body cleaned of all useful forensic evidence - except that the very cleaning is evidence of a kind - and left on a rubbish heap. A famous police detective is brought in from the south to assist the ""locals"" in solving the crime: from Los Angeles to Alaska in the current film; from Sweden to northern Norway in the original. In both cases, the locale is in the far north, in the summer, when the sun never sets. The southerner finds the continuous daylight disorientating, with night turned into day, and his sleep patterns are disrupted - hence the film's title.In the course of the investigation, during a stake-out gone wrong, the famous detective shoots and kills his partner, and then attempts to pin the killing on the young woman's murderer, through manipulation of the physical evidence. In each case, the rest of the film is an exploration of the detective's sense of guilt, his bizarre relationship with the murderer, who has witnessed the shooting, and his increasing instability from lack of sleep.The back-stories of the two films are very different. Detective Will Dormer (Pacino) arrives in Alaska with a lot more baggage than can be carried by hand. He's fabricated evidence in a gruesome abduction/murder case, and he's under investigation by Internal Affairs. His partner, Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) is about to cut a deal with I.A. to protect his own career. This provides the necessary tension between the two men to make the apparently accidental shooting suspect, not only in the viewer's mind, but also in Dormer's. In the original film, detective Jonas Engström (Stellan Skarsgård) also has a blot on his record, but there appears to be no I.A. investigation (or whatever the Swedish equivalent might be), and thus no real tension between the two detectives, beyond the fact that detective Erik Vik (Sverre Anker Ousdal), a much older man, is a bit of a plodder, cut from smoother cloth than Engström.The principal supporting role, that of the local female detective is also very different in the two films. In the current version, detective Ellie Burr (Swank) almost fawns over Dormer, and that characterisation creaked a little for me. Burr declares she has read all of Dormer's cases (how likely is that, really, since it appears that Dormer has been an L.A. detective for about 30 years?), and made a detailed study of one of his major cases during her stint at ""the academy"". In the original film, detective Hilde Hagen (Gisken Armand) is a seasoned, tough professional, who suffers no burden of hero-worship. For me that characterisation worked better. Happily, Swank's character grows as the film develops.I have mixed feelings about Robin Williams's role, possibly because it's a new take for him. (Which is all to the good: some of Williams's sentimental past performances require dangerously high doses of Gravol to sit through.) I thought that his character had rather too much to say for a demented killer, and in some scenes he was, as the English would say, ""too clever by half"". Overall, I would give his performance one-and-three-quarters thumbs up. I will say, however, that I liked the original - Bjørn Floberg  as the killer/writer Jon Holt - better. His characterisation had an edge, and a dangerous quality, that the Williams character lacked.One cannot say too much about Al Pacino's performance as Will Dormer. One review I read declared that the essence of the film is written on Pacino's rugged and wasted countenance. And that's true enough, but the greatest quality of his performance is in his eyes, in the depths of pain lodged in remembrance, the aspect of a decent man who has seen so much that he has, in his own last words, ""lost his way"". It's a brilliant turn. Pacino works the part for every nuance that it has, and then some.Skarsgård's take on detective Jonas Engström lacks the bravura quality of Pacino's Dormer. His character is less dramatic, more mundane, and the script gives the actor fewer opportunities for the ""big scene"". We never learn enough about him to have much reason to develop sympathy for his situation. The role is a great challenge, therefore, and Skarsgård does very well with it.Final note. ""Insomnia"" is beautifully filmed, the scenery rugged and spectacular. Those viewers who waited for the final credits to roll by will have discovered that the film, with the exception of the aerial footage of the ice fields at the start, was shot not in Alaska but in northern British Columbia. As a Canadian, that gave me added pleasure in this very fine film.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
There are two kinds of people in Alaska...,"In 2002 I went to the theaters and saw Insomnia on the big-screen. I was impressed by the eclectic range of characters from Hilary Swank, Al Pacino, and Robin Williams  a combination that I may have put money down prior to this film the group that would never share screen time together. I was wrong. I also was eagerly anticipating what Nolan would do with this film, having not seen the original when I went to the theater; I knew that he would bring us a compelling drama that would pull the best out of our cast. I was not disappointed. I loved the combination of acting between Pacino and Williams because they had two completely different styles. I thought Swank was decent, but contributed very little to the simpleton character she was to play  and I thought that Maura Tierney as the reclusive innkeeper was a great fit. I loved the way that Nolan filmed it, the cinematography was excellent, and the music kept me on the edge of my seat until the very, cliché ending. I was in awe of this film  that is  until I saw the original. Now, I find myself questioning the value of this film and of Nolan's honesty to the original director's vision. It nearly makes me tear up to see a great, valued independent foreign film get the slap of U.S.D.A. Hollywood on it with bigger budgets, bigger scripts, and an ending that seemed like it arrived directly from the ""How to build a great climax"" handbook handed to new  mainstream directors.For those looking for a review of just this version of Insomnia, I want to initially say that watching this film on its own is good. If you have not seen the original, then this is a great eye candy film with fantastic scenes that prove that Nolan can conquer his trade if given the opportunity (remember what he did with the Batman legacy), but together these films do not match up and fans of the original will scoff at Nolan's poor attempt to bring the honesty and directness that director Erik Skjoldbjærg superbly brought to the screen. I understand that one, when making comments about Insomnia, should keep them separate, but there are so many disheartening differences between the two that I do not want others to purely watch this one with Pacino and Williams, but instead see the two and make their own assessments. To begin, Pacino is no Stellan Skarsgård (as odd as that may be to say), but Skarsgård brings a character to the screen forcing us to follow the emotional level of the events, instead of Pacino's over-the-top reactions to situations. While Skarsgård brings intensity to the character due to events and his ""unknown"" past, Pacino brings a visual to the character. You cannot seem to take your eyes off Pacino, but that is just him being the actor that he is. There are elements left out of Nolan's interpretation that are key to truly giving us the ""bad cop"" mentality that we are supposed to have about Dormer. Oddly, in the original, we are not supposed to find ourselves liking or feeling sympathy for Skarsgård, but in this one we want to see Pacino come clean and rid himself of the guilt. A big difference between the two films is the cross-referencing between Pacino and Skarsgård, because by seeing each of these two bring something new to the table, we, as viewers, saw a completely different film.Nolan's discreet changes morphs this film into something completely different that originally conceived. To call this film a remake would be tough in my eyes, because it is not a remake. It is a new interpretation of a classic film. Nolan makes some small changes to the plot which ultimately changes that course of our characters and the overall tones of the film. For example, there is quite a bit more Hollywood ""running"" in Nolan's film than in the original. Skarsgård captures our attention because of his internal conflicts, while Nolan captures our attention in his film by forcing us to watch Pacino run Williams down, to see him screaming his lines at random characters, and the ending that just epitomizes the standard that Hollywood seems to embrace. Without giving away too much detail, I must say that unlike the original, more gunfire is used, the intensity of the music is increased, and an event occurs with our main character that changes the original film completely. That is why I cannot call this film a remake in any way shape or form. This is an interpretation, albeit a very close interpretation, but not identical. Nolan took chances, he changed the frame of the story, and gave us a pure 100% uncut slice of Hollywood that one could almost witness in any blockbuster released during the summer months. It was pathetic and if I were the director of the original, Nolan's interpretation would have made me rather upset.Overall, I still like Nolan's work, and while I have lowered my enjoyment of this film after seeing this original, I must say that from 2002-present I thoroughly enjoyed Nolan's Insomnia. So, where does that put us currently? I would suggest this film to friends mainly because I am a sucker for Pacino's work (early and recent), and for some strange reason I cannot say ""no"" to a Robin Williams' film (even if this took place during his ""dark"" stint). I also think that Nolan's craft is unmatched today, and while he will conform to Hollywood (i.e. Insomnia), he uses it to pay rent and finance his next films. I will say this to friends as well, if you want to see a great film, one must see the original Insomnia and witness a truly disturbing character at his best. Skarsgård is on the top of his game with version, and Pacino can not compete.Grade: *** ½ out of *****",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Enjoyable Movie!,"Insomnia was surprisingly an enjoyable watch. It was based in Alaska so I was expecting more scenery than plot, but thankfully the opposite occurred.

Pacino didn't over dramatize his role and did great. Hillary Swank, who I have never cared for, was outstanding.

Take a sleeping pill. Or watch this movie.,"I tried watching this a while back, but couldn't get past all the moaning and groaning about how they couldn't get any sleep. Not exactly riveting dialogue.But the reason I gave up on it was more personal. I've lived in Alaska, and this ain't Alaska. Look, Hollywood, Alaska is a pretty amazing place, and if you bothered to learn about it before you made your films, they might be better films. Instead, Hollywood just takes the Alaska name and uses it as an excuse to make up all sorts of fantasies, as though no one besides a half-million Alaskans have ever been there.Insomnia was filmed in Stewart, British Columbia, Canada, which is adjacent to Hyder, Alaska, the southernmost point of the state, which is a largely abandoned gold mining town and unsuited for filming this story. Stewart, on the other hand, is more modern than most small, rural Alaska communities, and doesn't look Alaskan. But more importantly, there is no midnight sun there.Heck, there's no midnight sun in Fairbanks, either; you have to go well above the Arctic Circle for that, and then you are going to find yourself in some really small, off the road communities, often without much in the way of utilities, shall we say. Not anything like Stewart, BC.What you do get in much of Alaska is that it stays light at night for much of the summer, even though the sun is below the horizon. In Fairbanks, it almost seems like daylight around the solstice. You see little kids playing softball at 11 p.m. in the summer. Alaskans love the long summer daylight, and stay up late by choice. It's not a matter of insomnia; you just have more energy with all that light, and figure you will have plenty of time to sleep in the winter.OK, so these cheechako detectives come up to Alaska and they can't sleep. And they keep moaning and groaning about it. Let's see, what oh what can they do?A) Go into your hotel room and pull the curtains, so it is dark in the room, put your head on the pillows and shut your eyes.B) Buy a sleep mask, one of those blindfolds that goes over your eyes while you sleep, which any regular airline traveler should have.C) Take two Benadryl.D) Go to a doctor and ask for a sleeping pill.These guys are detectives and they can't figure out how to cope with a little insomnia? They've never heard of sleeping pills? Sorry, no sale.But the larger problem is movies that don't match the reality of their settings. People tend to get a bit touchy. I saw someone complain that the 1945 version of State Fair didn't look like the real Iowa State Fair. An Indian complained that Dances With Wolves didn't match the look of the authentic tribes involved. Etc. When we see our home locale on the screen, it is easy to nitpick. Even if there are major errors, it depends on the type of movie whether such criticisms are justifiable.What bothers me about grossly inaccurate movies like Insomnia is the provincial stupidity they reveal about their makers, people too lazy to do even the slightest research about what a place like Alaska is really like. Many years ago there was some Italian director filming scenes in the train station in Anchorage with Harvey Keitel, except the movie was set in eastern Canada, and Keitel was supposed to be taking a train to the Canadian Arctic. Huh? Absolutely none of this made any sense, geographically. Train? Try a small plane, buddy. The movie, as far as I could tell, was never released, if it was even completed. Maybe they finally looked at a map.The reality of the far north of Alaska and Canada is much more romantic and interesting and beautiful than most of the idiotic versions produced by Hollywood. That's what also makes me sad about seeing ridiculous films like Insomnia. If they had filmed it in something resembling a real Alaskan bush community in the far north, one with a mile or two of road, 10 bars and two general stores, that would have been a film with character.",,Anonymous,Mystery
A good watch,"I went in with no expectations - I have yet to see Memento so I have nothing good or bad to say about Christopher Nolan, and although Robin Williams usually annoys the hell out of me, from the trailers for this film I figured that this character wouldn't be his usual over-manic obnoxious self.I was impressed over all. While not the best film I've seen this year, it's pretty high up. Some gorgeous cinematography (being filmed in rural Alaska didn't hurt this film at all!) although at times the occasional lack of focus and rapid cuts started to get irritating and detracted from the point they were supposed to be making.Aside from the unfortunate casting of Hilary Swank; Martin Donovan is excellent as always, Robin Williams is in his best role since the Fisher King, Al Pacino is Al Pacino (which is either good or bad, depending on whether you like Al Pacino;) and Maura Tierney is once again shamefully underused.Overall: a good film.

Saw the original....Next night saw the remake.....SEE THE ORIGINAL,"I don't really want to say the remake is a ""bad"" movie. If I hadn't seen the original first (the Norwegian original), I probably would think the Hollywood version was just a LITTLE bit better than it was. However, having seen the original, I was disappointed in the remake and that brought the flick down a peg. There are some HUGE differences between the two, although basically the same plot, of course.It seemed to me that the remake had the potential to be EVEN BETTER than the original, which in my opinion was GREAT. Hollywood movies tend to be ""bigger"" all over than their foreign counterparts...more action, faster paced, more animated, better movie sets, more ""blockbuster"" if you will. Having said that, I really don't go for the whole Schwarzenegger explosion chase scene mow 'em down with your machine gun good guy bad guy thing anyway (OK I'll give ya Star Wars...but that's pretty much it....and please note it's Schwarzeneggerless). My biggest fear was that Hollywood would turn this into yet another F bomb loaded bang bang shoot 'em up cop story. My worst fear was pretty much confirmed. I'm not a prude. I'm not against violence in film (IF it ADDS to the film and is NOT ""gratuitous."") But the GREAT thing about the original is that the LACK of ""blockbuster"" elements makes it a really TAUT, TIGHT, TENSION FILLED, PSYCHOLOGICAL SLOWBURN, and THAT made the ""creepiness"" of the film much more visceral and consistently sustained throughout (maybe along the lines of something like ""Blood Simple""?). Moreover, the ending of the original film was the icing on the already delicious, well crafted cake.It wouldn't be fair to kill the remake completely. The plot line sells itself, and there are more twists and turns in the remake (perhaps TOO many to suspend disbelief, though). Maybe this is simply because everyone talks so much faster than in the original and it's faster paced, and therefore there's more room to insert ""more bang for your buck"". It's not ALL bad, though, because Al Pacino was excellent, and Robin Williams was the best thing out of EITHER movie (that man is actually a comedian???...with a MAJOR LEAGUE creep factor like THAT??? He was impeccable.) There's more ""banter"" in the remake, and the Robin Williams character was expanded, and those were pluses. However, it just doesn't make up for the typical, Hollywood ""let's throw this in and that in and have police cars racing with sirens blaring"" (when it's unnecessary and counterproductive if you want to actually SOLVE a crime) ""and if we throw enough stuff in we'll have an action packed thriller alright...and who cares about suspension of disbelief anyway as long as we can make it so we have that climactic bang bang shoot 'em up at the end?"" Sighhhhhhh. Ugh. I should have known. What a letdown.You certainly won't sleep through Insomnia (2002), but sadly, this one is MUCH more ""predictable"" (""formulaic"") than the original (1997), and it's frustrating. It could have been so very good, and it had the potential to be even BETTER than the Norwegian original (as excellent as it is). On the bright side, SEE THE ORIGINAL, do it on a night where you're not in a rush, and turn the lights out (no pun intended on that ""bright side"" thing, although it DOES work for the film's very clever 24 hours of daylight reverse film noir motif now that I think of it). I'm not a horror movie fan, and this is not a horror movie...but the original was actually quite creepy in several ways, you will not have to suspend disbelief ANYWHERE NEAR AS MUCH, and it DEFINITELY is engaging despite the relatively slow pace (in fact the ""slow"" pace actually ADDS to the ""taut"", ""creepy"" feeling in general). The best compliment I can give the Norwegian production is that it certainly is a WELL CRAFTED piece of film making. See it. The 1997 original doesn't disappoint.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

vanilla ice-cream on white bread,"You Have Got To Be Kidding! How could so many intelligent movie lovers be sucked into rating this film so highly. The IMDb staff should be ashamed for falling for the ""star-power"" and credentials involved in this disaster.At best, Insomnia is predictable, uninteresting, emotionally flat (except for Pacino's performance - which seemed totally out of place among such boring bland and uninteresting performances). Robin Williams is not the slightest bit convincing as a psychotic author/murderer. Swank's character was every bit as flat and lifeless as the rest. Predictable, boring, and thoroughly forgettable. There was surprisingly little emotion (anger, betrayal, bitterness, sorrow, depression, whatever) conveyed as she witnessed the fall of her hero. The plot is given away so soon that the only tension created in the film is Pacino's insomnia - which makes this film as interesting, gripping, and engaging as actually having insomnia.This is definitely not a ""Thriller"". There was no suspense throughout the whole movie. I saw it twice and waited for it - the music told me it was supposed to be there but film I saw was anticlimactic.I have to give some credit to whoever tried to save this story by throwing in the ""good cop makes a mistake""/cover-up type subplot. It was almost interesting enough to watch Pacino's character wrestle with the white nights and a crippling conscience. But then those other cardboard characters would interrupt and turn the plot focus to into vanilla ice-cream on white bread.Now, don't get me wrong, I love Robin Williams and Hillary Swank. They are extremely talented and I would probably make a point to see any movie they are in. Memento is a landmark film in independent cinema - I loved it! They all deserve the awards they received for those specific films. BUT, the ugly fact is that, despite the talent and ""star-power"", they made a bad movie together. For what ever reasons they didn't deliver performances worthy of their best work. It happens to the best.

Oh, the initial crime, the murder of the young girl, is typical enough, but the players make the whole thing interesting.

Robin Williams is the killer, a run of the mill minor author with poor social skills and a knowledge of forensics from his crime novels. Hillary Swank gives a new dimension to the over anxious rookie who admires Dormer, but hates the way the evidence is pointing. While not your typical crime story, the story brings a psychological depth that few films offer, an insight into the minds of the characters. Language and nudity in context are within the bounds of decency, and these days the film might have gotten a PG-14 rating instead of an R.

A good thriller marred by questionable circumstances,"This is an edgy thriller that, provided you can get through the questionable premise  two street-smart cops are called to Alaska to help solve a 72-hour-old murder (gee, how long would it take to get through the red tape to make THAT happen?)  keeps you on the edge of your seat.Al Pacino is brilliant as an insomniac on the edge (he's come under investigation in L.A.  so WHY would they send a cop under a cloud all the way to Alaska?  Does L.A. routinely export its dirty cops?).  He really does make you think he hasn't slept since he made it to the Land of the Midnight Sun.Robin Williams does well in a relatively minor role as the author-boyfriend- suspect putting Pacino to the test (but his character seems to know an awful lot about Pacino's past; where does THAT  knowledge come from, and why does he know that Pacino is even in town to investigate this murder?).  Hilary Swank is good as a novice Alaskan cop not taken seriously by her co-workers (how many cops DOES it take to run this little Alaskan town with so little crime?), but she has some hokey moments, including a real clunky one with Pacino at the very end of the movie.This film was directed by the same guy who did `Memento' (Christoper Nolan), but don't expect the same genre of quirkiness.

"a worthy effort, but some formulaic styles","I was privileged to see 'Insomnia' on May 1st, 2002 at an advance screening on my campus.  I am a film student and have been eagerly awaiting any new releases by Christopher Nolan after watching 'Memento.'  I particularly liked Nolan's innovative style that is seen all throughout 'Memento.' Unfortunately his innovation takes a vacation for much of 'Insomnia' as it becomes a stereotypical murder mystery and even a bit of a horror towards the end.  Al Pacino has enough screen presence to be 80% of the film and still carry it well.  Robin Williams and Hillary Swank put in roles that were nothing near the limits of their acting abilities.  The plot had enough twists in it (amidst some weak dialogue) to make this an enjoyable film. This is one of the most enjoyable murder mysteries I have yet seen, but this became a very Hollywood style movie with less innovation then I expected from Christopher Nolan. All around, I give this 3 stars out of 4.  Not a must see film, but recommended if you like murder mysteries or Al Pacino.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Fair, but not an eye opener","Despite the hooplah, I found this one of the mediocre films of the year so far.  It does hold ones interest, however, it is predictable and somewhat boring.  Al Pacino is aging and not as facile in his performance as he has been in the past.  Robin Williams, the villian in this movie, is playing well but it too is not his best performance.  Perhaps his next film out now has a slight edge on this sleeper.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
#Movie Review,"I have only 1 word to say about this movie MASTERPIECE !!!! MANN THIS MOVIE IS SO GOOD I AM SO HYPE hehe..no but for real Christopher Nolan respect!Meticulous crafted story packed with thrilling action and a powerful message this movie simply rocks! There are only a few minor things that bothered me, regardless the good parts totally outshine them..no plot holes gentlemen.Brilliant acting , Al Pacino steals the show, marvelous performance, I was hooked the entire movie! Definitely Recommend it 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Once,Al Pacino was once a great actor. For the last years his films have been boring. He looks like he has no interest in the part he is playing. He looks very tired. I'm sure he does not need the money. Maybe time to call it quits.,7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Snooze Alert Warning,"I can't understand the applause for this terribly boring and under developed story. After Memento I expected a interactive, thought provoking movie, what I got was a definite disapointment. The name Al Pacino invokes memories of some of the greatest movies of all time (Godfather,Scarface,Heat,to name a few) this will not be mentioned in the same breath as those. Having 3 oscar winning actors in the film is wonderful accomplishment, but it does not make it a Oscar caliber movie. Swank's performance was uninspired and contrived, Pacino's performance almost let me catch some ZZZZ's, Williams as a murderer, ewww terribly frightening,not really. I wish people would not be mesmerized by Pacino, but the fear of criticizing a legend overwhelms most, not me, I dont blame him although it appears he sleepwalks (pun intended) through his scenes, the story is weak, dull, and woefully spotty. If you want to waste your 9$ go see it, if not spend 3$ and rent ""The Usual Suspects"".",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good enough?,"Insomnia is definitely overshadowed by all of Nolan's recent outings since Batman Begins (as well as the far superior Memento). It has a great atmosphere, and technically it is great, but the screenplay lacks and feels incredibly contrived at times, as well as having some pretty cringe-worthy dialogue at times. Still, despite that, it mostly succeeds and is pretty entertaining, even if it really does seem incredibly forgettable. I have no curious wonders or question why it's not more popular, but as it is, I recommend it. I wouldn't even know if it's Nolan worst film, since I'm not a huge fan of him. But for fans, seek it out.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Must watch for a Nolan fan,"This movie right here defines the possibility that Nolan can push with his films. The film casts Al Pacino in the main role, as a detective for Police Department of Los Angeles. The film has amazing cinematography with scenes being shot in Alaska I presume. All the scenes are beautifully shot, and they are eye catching.After watching 'Memento,' I found him very intriguing and ingenious with his style of directing and approach to film making. He is well-known in this movie industry and his movies are a solid evidence to why this is true.Even though Al Pacino looks very old in this movie, I found his role satisfactory as a detective. The movie has a lot of things to grasp your attention for 118 minutes. The film takes twist and turns throughout the movie. A perfect drama, crime thriller for you and by the way this movie can be watched by with your family (if they don't mind some gore obviously, no sexual scenes are in the movie).I'm just gonna say that I was not satisfied by the ending, that's the reason for the rating.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great directing... great acting... good movie.,"I wouldn't rate this as the best movie of the year, or even Mr. Nolan's masterpiece to date.  I read a review on this board that gave this movie a 10/10, but I just can't go that far.  Most of my reluctance to call this such a great movie comes from the fact that Christopher Nolan didn't write it.  He is such a talent as a director and a writer, that when they come together it's a beautiful thing.  This is a remake of a 1997 movie, so you can only expect so much from it.  I knew this going into the movie, but many people didn't, and they expected the excitement level of Memento, where Nolan was able to write in so many twists & turns.  This movie just doesn't have that level of involvement, but don't get me wrong... it's a great movie.  Al Pacino gave a magnificent performance, as did Robin Williams in an uncommon role.  I like seeing him when he isn't the funny guy, so it was what I expected from him.  I thought the little audio & visual clues that Nolan drops into the movie ever so subtly is one of the best parts of this film.  It isn't so blatantly obvious that when you see the foreshadowing you pick up on it and know it's something you should remember, just not why, and it isn't so hidden that it takes you knowing about it to find it or look out for it.  It's one of his many skills as a director that I've noticed in his previous works, and look forward to in his future projects.  This movie was done when Memento took off, so I'm hoping for something great to come soon. This movie is well worth the watch, and I'll see it again, but don't go into it expecting it to be Memento 2 or you will leave bored & disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Doesn't Quite Work,"I can accept the plot contrivances but something doesn't quite click in this interesting but seriously flawed film. The flaw I am sorry to say is in the direction (and screenplay, of course). Momento was brilliant, but Insomnia isn't. Plot lines don't come together, even though the story line is pregnant with possibilities. An accidental death--or is it--and the hero is conveniently free of disciplinary charges that would have materialized if his partner lived. Scheming with a killer and almost allowing an innocent person to be framed. These all make for an intriguing drama--yet, for some inexplicable reason, the film comes off somewhat flat. The acting, scenery, sound--all are excellent, but something, somewhere misses and the movie doesn't quite work.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Finally watched it from my favorite director. Good is the floor, apparently!","This was more of a (really) slow burn.
The story is nothing really special, about ""good cops vs. the right way vs. the judicial system vs. the bad cops vs. the bad guys"". Done before and after. It's fine. It's good.Problem is, the clichés that built the story the first 40 minutes are a bit boring to watch.After that, the tension goes up and never goes down. Pacino was really good, in kind of an easy role for him, but contrary to many, I dislike very much Robin Williams in general and he again just doesn't work here. (Awakenings may be the only time I thought it was good on a role).Here, Robin Williams destroys everything with his acting, tone, presence and face. Except for one scene, he fails Pacino and the movie. Put Patrick Wilson (or many others) on the role? This is suddenly much, much better. Swank wasn't that good either. Allison Tolman from Fargo Season 1 would've nailed the part! (with time traveling, I know).In the end, the worst Nolan movie, it is still good.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A major improvement for Nolan,"I must admit that I am not a Chris Nolan fan. I do not buy into his style of often self-indulgence. But I also admit that when the closing credits for Insomnia began to roll, I was spellbound. A one of a kind dream-like thriller that grabs us from the start and never lets go as the horrors of insomnia and small-town murder unfold. Pacino is great as usual, but Williams is the center of the spotlight in a very uncharacteristic performance as a shady writer. Most people prefer Nolan's Inception or The Dark Knight over this, but I disagree completely. This is his most well-made and probably his only really well-made film.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good but not a classic.,"Al Pacino, as we all know, is a fine actor. Michael Corleone. Frank Serpico. Richard Roma. 'Lefty' Ruggiero. Did I mention Michael Corleone. Yes? Oh well. Michael Coreleone.Not that his Detective Will Dormer is as memorable as these guys but its still a nice performance. Some memorable scenes like the phone call to the widow. This is slow burning Pacino for those who think he just does too much Foghorn Leghorn these days - bellowing and waving his arms. (I'm divided on the subject but admit he can go over the top).Plot outline: The Alaskan sun is pretty much up all the time and Dormer has to deal with a murder investigation/cagey murder suspect while not getting any sleep.To sum it up, this will keep you interested. Christopher Nolan is a talented guy and sets the mood pretty well - shots of chilly landscape constantly lit with light - and keeps the story ticking over. I thought Robin Williams was good in his change of pace role, as a calm and icy suspect and had good chemistry with Pacino. My friend still thought he wasn't dark enough. In the end though, they don't take the concept far enough and you're not left very satisfied. It pretty much goes where you suspect it to go and then just ends.Watchable but not a classic.

Excellent Psychological Thriller,"Christopher Nolan and Al Pacino are both are masters of their craft, and it great to see them working together. Insomnia is the best film Pacino has done since Heat and Christopher Nolan's first Hollywood, allowing him to re-boot Batman.Set in Alaska during the summer of 24-hour daylight, a 17-year-old girl had been murdered in a small town. LA police detectives Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) have been asked to help the small town investigate. Both are experienced detectives, friends with the police chief and they are being investigated by Internal Affairs in their native city. Whilst investigating Dormer sets out to find the evidence, know every thing about the victim and match the information to a suspect. He quickly finds out that her boyfriend was abusive (the local bad boy), she had a fallen out with her best-friend and received expensive gifts. After setting a trap for the murderer goes wrong an officer is injured, but worst of all Dormer shots and kills Eckhart. It's seems to be a tragic accident but Eckhart believed it was deliberate. Dormer blames it one the killer. Now Dormer has a 3 way challenge, to find the killer and battle his mind games, cover up him killing Eckhart which is being investigated by a talented young officer Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank) and battle the affects of guilt and insomnia.Insomnia is a clever, tight thriller, with themes about guilt, psychological damage and the grey world of right and wrong. Nolan handles the material with skill and keeps the audience guessing. He slowing builds the jigsaw. Some pieces are obvious, some more subtle. You find out who the killer is pretty early, like in real life the prime suspect is normally the killer. But this is a film about mind-games and the affect of insomnia and guilt. Nolan keeps the film going and keeps it under 2 hours. The writer and director does a good job handling the multi-layered, but interlinking plot so you don't get lost in the film.There are excellent actors in the film. Al Pacino is brilliant, as he normally is. He is best actor in the film and his character has some similarities to his character in Heat. He about to show the mix elements of the character, but still makes him sympathetic. Robin Williams shows he can be a good, serious actor, but his performance in One Hour Photo was better. Hilary Swank is also a good actress in this film. There were no weak links in the film acting wises.My one criticism of the film is it was a bit too Hollywood, reminding me of Silence of the Lambs. I wanted something a little less conventional. But it is still a good movie.If you like Insomnia I personally recommend Se7en, Heat and Zodiac.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
comparing two Insomnias,"I was searching through IMDb for comparisons between original Norwegian Insomnia from 1997 and Hollywood's Insomnia 2002, to find out whether it is worth to see the latter, and not to repeat the experience I've had with Vanilla Sky and Abre Los Ojos. It is not that I dislike the VS, but ALO obliterates the impression from VS completely, so I wondered if I should bother renting I02 (Insomnia 2002) at all. Well, I was surprised that I02 is worth viewing _even_ after I97. So, here I'll try to write for those who also wonder which one's better.First, both are very good films, with excellent actors' work, graphics, and music, and I won't compare these. But I believe that I02 scenario is a bit flawed, because where I97 gives less or no reason at all for a particular response or action of a character, I02 invariably puts things so that the same response or action is the only choice for the character. To put it bluntly, psychologically I97 is more like a David Lynch's movie, whereas I02 resembles more a thriller with Michael Douglas, where all pieces are meant to move by a strictly defined orbit, a brilliant but still somewhat dumbed down version. I personally value the former kind of movies more, so naturally I97 gets more of my credit.So, if you can, see both, I97 and then I02 ( at least I've seen them in that order ), but if you only want to choose just one, I97 would be, in my opinion, better.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Robin Williams Out Of Character In A Movie With Too Many Flaws,"I had been intrigued by this movie from the time it first appeared, largely because I was curious to see how well Robin Williams would handle a straight dramatic role. Simply put, he was all right, but the movie itself was rather weak and uninspired.The first thing I wondered about was the premise. A teenage girl is murdered in a place called Nightmute, Alaska, and the local police department there calls upon the LAPD for assistance, who end up sending two detectives to help out - Dormer (Al Pacino) and Eckhardt (Martin Donovan). They have no detectives in Alaska? I mean I'm sure that murder isn't especially common up there but they had no one who could help? The cities of Anchorage or Juneau wouldn't have had a detective who knew something about  murder investigations? I just thought that whole idea was problematic.Second problem was the characters themselves. Frankly speaking, there wasn't a single likeable character in the whole movie. There was no one to root for. There was killer Finch (Williams), irritating hero-worshiping local Alaska cop Ellie (Hilary Swank) - no wonder they had to go out of state - corrupt Dormer (Pacino) and his squealing partner Eckhardt (Donovan.) Is there anyone here to feel sympathy with? NO!Third problem was the storyline revolving around the title. Yes, Pacino has the right look for a guy who's gone 6 days without sleep. But so what? The movie would have worked just as well if Dormer had been well rested, but we have to have this story about how it's hard to sleep when one first goes to Alaska in the summer because the sun is always up. OK. That's exciting.Anything good about this movie? Well, the opening musical score was quite good and really drew me in (until the movie actually started anyway); it sets the tone quite well for a suspense cop thriller. Problem is there's not a lot of suspense or thrills coming up. And Williams came across well in this very out of character role for him. Unfortunately, it just isn't a very good movie.3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good, But You Can't Quite Warm Up to it...","""Insomnia"" is an odd film, because you can never quite warm up to it. It has great actors, a great director, and a pretty good plot...and it came off pretty good, but somehow, not ""great."" There is something about the movie you just can't warm up to, and it's pretty evident while you watch the film.Al Pacino plays a detective sent to Alaska, along with his partner, to investigate into the death of a young woman. When he gets there, he begins a search on a foggy day, where he spots the killer and gives chase. Through the fog, Pacino mistakes his partner for the killer, and fires his weapon, killing him. Thinking no one saw this, Pacino files a case that the killer shot his partner and Pacino came upon the body. He disposes of all evidence and begins to search for the killer once more. Until he gets a call.The killer of the woman is on the phone, saying that he saw the whole thing from yesterday and that he saw Pacino shoot his partner. Now the killer (Robin Williams) has something to hold against Pacino (although the whole idea of the killer having something against him seems to wither away quite quickly).""Insomnia"" is the next film from ""Memento"" director Christopher Nolan. He's a talented director, and ""Memento"" is one of my favorites (perhaps), so you come to expect a certain amount of talent from the director's next film. Well, he does a good job here, but unlike ""Memento,"" we can't really care about the characters as much. As the end unfolded, I found myself not really caring about Pacino's character anymore. Quite frankly, I wanted it all to end. It is a bit too long for its own good, because the plot, characters and dialogue becomes worn after a while.Al Pacino is one of the best actors out there; you think of gangster films, you think Brando, De Niro, and Pacino. But Al has proven he can play more than Al Capone and Michael Corleone, and while he gives a good performance here, he doesn't seem quite thrilled that he is in the movie. Granted, the idea is that the detective can get no sleep, but he acts drowsy from the beginning on. A sign of great acting, or a sign of regret?Robin Williams has been, apparently, trying to prove that he can act drama. ""Good Will Hunting,"" ""What Dreams May Come,"" ""One Hour Photo."" Quite frankly, I miss the funny Robin Williams. The funny Robin Williams that made us laugh in so many films and practically made (in terms of saving) such films as ""Jumanji"" and ""Hook""--underrated films that I enjoyed. I didn't care for ""Good Will Hunting"" very much, and ""What Dreams May Come"" was just plain weird. So I'm hoping that Robin returns to comedy pretty soon (I heard that ""Death to Smoochy"" was awful, so I won't count that as comedy).Yes, ""Insomnia"" is a good film, but there's something about it that you just can't warm up to, and it's hard to ignore that sense of feeling.3.5/5 stars -John Ulmer",,Anonymous,Mystery
Absolutely Captivating!!,"This movie is more Shakesperian tragedy than thriller, but it is beautifully constructed.  The performances by Pacino and Williams are superb.  Each of them captures the subtleties of each character in a manner which complements the script and cinematography.  And although Swank's role is less involved, her performance is also noteworthy.Speaking of the cinematography, it is truly a work of art.  This movie has some gorgeous scenic shots and expertly captures Will Dormer's torment throughout the movie.  The filmwork alone makes the film a must-see.  An excellent script along with great performances from the entire cast makes this one of the best Hollywood films of 2002.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Most predictable Nolan Film till date.,"Insomnia (2002) :
Brief Review -The Most predictable Nolan Film till date. Watching this film after watching all universally acclaimed Classics of legendary director Nolan is like giving matric examination after passing degree with distinction. Insomnia is the only psychological thriller directed by Nolan and we know he never repeat any genre (except for TDK Trilogy) so this film was meant to have something chilling and thrilling stuff. But like all Nolan films this one lacks power punch in the climax. All i mean is, Insomnia is a Nolan's Film without trademarks of Nolan. The film is about a cop who is asked to solve a murder case but himself commits a crime during the investigation. The real murderer tries to settle his account with him for knowing about this crime committed by the cop. Overall, this is a nice plot except it doesn't explore psychological elements we saw in cult films of 90s. Maybe it was late considering the fact that Holywood had found better ideas with psychological thrillers like 'Silence Of The Lambs' and 'Fight Club' which had real thrilling climaxes. As i see, every Nolan Film had something saved for the climax to blow us away but Insomnia wasn't the one. Specially when it was needed such stuff for being a film of this intricate genre. Insomnia is very good movie and definitely watchable even in repeat viewings and no doubts most of the credit goes to the performances of Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank. What it misses is innovative ideas to end the suspense and unpredictability. There was lot of talk about 'Wild Card' in this plot but where was it? I couldn't see anything sort of that. So, Insomnia misses some things but simultaneously adds some small small things to make the overall picture look Great. You know, Nolan had done far better than this.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Less tricksy then Momento, but as good","Director Christopher Nolan re-invented the thriller genre when, in his film 'Momento', he told the story backwards. 'Insomnia', his follow-up movie, is less tricksy and covers some fairly familiar ground: corrupt cop, pretty female assistant, manipulative psychopath, horrific murder - none of this is especially new territory for film. But in spite of this, 'Insomnia' is every bit as gripping as its predecessor, thanks to some economical storytelling, Al Pacino playing ravaged as only Al Pacino can, the backdrop of some stunning but savage Alaskan scenery, but above all else, through Nolan's wonderfully taut and claustrophobic direction. Some scenes (the chases in the fog, and on the logs) are pure cliché, yet in Nolan's hands they come alive in a way that they fail to do nine times out of ten. Nolan is a clearly a major talent, and with this film, he has proved himself not just an imaginative young tyro, but also one capable of working with a serious budget and major stars. For all the obviousness of the premise, this movie shows how this sort of thriller ought to be done.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great Al Pacino with Great Director,"We can consider "" Insomnia "" a new style Hitchcock movie . This movie has a unique vision of director Christopher Nolan which takes place in far north Alaskan town which never gets dark and they refer it as "" white nights "" , and this is one of the main keys and centers all the dark events moving around . Christopher Nolan is a very intelligent director and he transfers his ' unique ' ideas to the audience through unusual ways . Its a dark movie in a non dark place and there is some sort of mystery around a girl murder occurred that local authority can't deal with . Al Pacino played the leading role as detective "" Dormer "" who is sent to investigate that murder . Since Pacino's character is not used to the constant daylight he has problems sleeping throughout the film. This lack of sleep leads Pacino's character to make huge mistakes throughout the film . While watching the film the audience feels the pain that Al Pacino is going through, while also feeling as though they have not gotten sleep for six days either , and here appears why Christopher Nolan is a great director in the modern days of cinema industry . Robin Williams surprisingly plays the murderer character "" Finch "" a local non-famous writer and its quite opposite what we used to see Williams's do in his movies .",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good, but could've been great.","Let me begin by saying I enjoyed Insomnia, and I recommend seeing it. The story, the twists, the camera work, the sound, the direction is all top notch, but what hurts the movie is bad casting and mediocre acting. Except for Al Pacino. I think we take our great actors for granted sometimes. Like here, Al Pacino gives a great performance, but he always gives a great performance, and I think we just expect it. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast (except for Paul Dooley as the police chief) phone in their performances. It's not that Robin Williams, Hillary Swank and Maura Tierney's performances are bad, it's just that they're mediocre and it detracts from an otherwise very interesting story. Part of this problem stems from the characters themselves as written, because they are very formulaic and un-interesting. Even Robin Williams as the killer is pretty boring, which is something I thought I would ever say about him. Let's face it, the killer always makes or breaks this style of film, ala Silence of The Lambs. So if we as an audience don't despise the 'bad guy' it's difficult to get emotional about the movie, and Williams doesn't do much here to have the audience hate him. His character is more like a fly that keeps buzzing around your face that you want to swat away. I won't go into the plot of the movie because a lot of the comments here have already done that, but as I said earlier I think the plot and side-stories here are very interesting and Christopher Nolan, the director, does a great job of conveying through the camera, what it must be like to have insomnia. The photography and scenes of the Alaskan landscapes are some of the best I've ever seen. The score was also very well done. I believe we have a lot to look forward to from Mr. Nolan in the future. Based on the story, the technical aspects, the direction and Al Pacino's performance I rate Insomnia 8 out of 10, only because IMDB doesn't allow me to vote 7.5.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
No cure for Insomnia here,"This film is definitely not to be seen if you are suffering from insomnia, as the director Christopher Nolan, and Al Pacino do a great job of depicting the complaint. This is truly an example of daylight film noir, as one of our local critics put it. One does wonder whether a thicker set of curtains might have helped, but Al plays a man at the end of his tether in a number of respects. His career is in doubt, he has no personal life to speak of and he faces a bleak retirement. Yet he is tenacious in solving the case. His young local assistant, hero-worshiping him from afar gets to know some of the cost of being a good detective.Robin Williams plays the supercilious killer (we learn early on it is indeed him and the suspense lies in whether a case can be put against him). This character is really a literary conceit - most crims are not terribly smart- and a difficult part to realise effectively, but Williams, who is good at oddballs, plays him in a low-key, effective way. I usually find 'why I did it' scenes artificial, but here they seem to work.Hillary Swank as the young cop is all bright eyes and bushy tail but she fills the role admirably as the eager beaver who wants to learn from the great detective. She teams well with Pacino, who's seen it all and can't forget what he's seen.The landscape, darkly brooding, is a character also. Most of the film was filmed in British Columbia rather than Alaska where the story is set (though we do see a couple of Alaskan glaciers). Anyway, almost all of the inhabited parts of Alaska are below the Arctic circle and don't have the midnight sun, whereas Tromso, the setting of the original Norwegian film this is a remake of, is indeed above 66 degrees north. Not to worry, it seems it's not just the light that's preventing Al from sleeping.Christopher Nolan directs here in a much more straightforward fashion than he did in 'Memento', but he's good at menace and setting the movie on the frontier gives it an edge, at least for those who see the frontier as a scary place. In fact you are probably safer in the wilds of Alaska than the streets of LA. Not to worry. This is a very satisfactory thriller from the dark side, despite the perpetual daylight.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Solid film with numerous basic stand out aspects such as acting, cinematography and script but it does do a little more than you think.","I'm not sure what surprised me more, the fact that this was actually a remake of a Scandinavian film or the fact that deep down, Insomnia is a really smart and classy thriller. There are so many examples of thrillers from recent years that get into a groove of good guy, bad guy, love interest and rely on their special effects and stunts to pull it home. In Insomnia, these things are toyed with a little and what with a few other well made and thought through conventions, it makes Insomnia rather enjoyable.After you get the customary set up which reminded me of The Silence of the Lambs what with the police agent acting as a fish out of water (Academy to the Frontline in The Silence's case  Los Angeles to freezing, backwater town in this case) brought in to track a murderer whilst having the plot involve a rookie female of some sort. What's clever here is that we know as much as the police do from very early on but as secrets and situations arise, the path we go down with Will Dormer (Pacino) is as decisive as it is enthralling. Insomnia is a really well shot film  its use of the Alaskan setting through long, external shots and the way it portrays inside settings as so 'in-between' light and dark are really good. The fact the town he's in is almost always engulfed by light at the time of his visit acts as a fabulous device.Where Insomnia breaks away from the standard thriller is when it toys with the prospect of role reversal. After Dormer gets a call from Walter Finch (Williams) who's assumed to be a murder suspect since it was him running from a set up and it was him who has 'one up' on Dormer for events you'll discover, the film moves into a period of about thirty minutes revolving around Finch proving his 'innocence' that the death was an accident and Dormer becoming more and more besieged by guilt and the blackmail Finch has on him. It's almost as if Finch is now the OK guy and Dormer is the one who has done bad and this is emphasised through the way he sees the world: he's starting to see everything in a distorted manner, he's having to tidy up his mistake by covering his tracks; something a murderer would have to do as well as come up with alibis. He's also failing to sleep at night and at one point is mocked by Finch for 'breaking his record'. This is Dormer entering the killer's mindset and it's done really well, having an interesting spin on things.I suppose the reason Insomnia's such a well made and effective thriller is that its director is Christopher Nolan who pays attention to fine detail. The way the editing becomes a little erratic and you could say 'slack' but I think it's for a reason  heads are in different positions as reverse shots are displayed during conversations (like on the ferry) and it becomes quite abrupt, emphasising the lack of sleep Dormer's had. Like I said, the film does play around with who's 'good', who's evil and who's being pinned as evil when really maybe they're not and Hilary Swank's character of Ellie Burr is perhaps a little more than a supporting character when you think about it. Despite all the manipulation, the 'order' is eventually restored so that felt a little disappointing as I felt the film set itself up nicely for a twist of some sort.Make no mistake, Insomnia is well made and has made me curious as to what the original is like. I can just imagine Stellan Skarsgård running around an icy Scandinavian country dealing with the things that happens in this narrative. For maximum effect, watch the film late at night when you've got that feeling that you just know you'll be tired in about an hour and half but you start the film anyway.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
good movie,"I have read some of these online reviews, and have come to the conclusion that most people missed the point completely.  The movie is about crossing the line or breaking the social contract, and the moral decisions that it entails.  Robin Williams isn't a psychopath, even though he could definetly be called an eccentric failing writer.  Nevertheless, he crossed the line that has been outlined for people by the social contract that in a sense has been promulgated through christianity.  Of course, I'm getting a little off topic, but the fact remains that the ending revolves around the idea of owning up to what you may have or have not done.  The idea of it being light outside all day only accentuates the fact that it is associated with being awake.  Conversley, night is associated with sleep, and the subconscious doesn't allow either one of the main characters to sleep for long.  If you're looking for a hollywoodesque blockbuster about a cop chasing down a criminal out of vengence or whatever it might be, this movie is not for you. This is far deeper.  I've seen two (Memento and Insomnia) of Nolan's three movies, and I think he has to be considered one of the best contemporary directors.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
poor christoper nolan,"i feel bad for christopher nolan, the director. he comes off the heels of mememto, which people may not have seen in the theater, but have gotten around to watching on dvd.  he not only gets good previous material here, but a budget and 3 oscar winners in the actor and actress categories. i won't give anything away.  there is only one thing a viewer of this film should do--rent the original (or watch it on ifc).  someone stepped in on nolan's film and made it too polite, without much risk.al pacino's character, dormer, is the one we must follow throughout the film.  in EVERY case in this film, i felt his character was justified in his actions.  unfortunately, his actions are a source of suspense and plot revelation in the film, but with little conflict (we know who did it from the COMMERCIALS) the story needs some internal conflict or character flaw to make it more interesting.  should he have done this?  should he have done that?  well, yes.  move along. i don't understand why everything has to be tidy at the end.  there is no thought process going on in a viewer's mind once the credits roll--that is all taken care of for us.  any question you might ask is moot by the finale. and that's sad.  anything that was sexual, mildly perverse, or disturbing was taken out of the original and sanitized to make a cleaner, more ""psychological"" film. nolan does nothing wrong here.  he adds clever flashbacks to make an old storyline juxtapose a newer one.  you'll see--it's something similar to what he did in memento, and it works again here.  the guy is 31 years old, has done three films.  i look forward to his next one, especially if it doesn't have major stars in it.  perhaps this is merely a case of him paying his dues in a bigger film so he can make better ones in the future with his vision. rating--6 out of 10.  it's not terrible, especially as a character study of pacino's dormer.  it just doesn't leave you with much to think or talk about.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
brilliant movie with a murder that is not the main chapter in the movie,"this film is brilliant made. You can almost say that it's a sort of soap movie.

Well that is the information the detective and the killer give each other. the detective (Al Pacino) has insomnia, because it doesn't turn dark in that place in alaska.

A different style for Nolan.,"Differs from other movies by Christopher Nolan, he drifts away from his usual complex plot twists and overlapping stories. It is not a bad crime/thriller movie, i just expected something more extravagant here. Insomnia really did not have that huge of an impact on Will Dormer, i expected something crazy here.Nonetheless, the movie is decent, maybe i am just a little disappointed since i love Nolan's complex, mind twisting movies. Could have incorporated something interesting regarding Dormer's insomnia, he just had some mere hallucinations and that is it. But, alright for a crime movie it was decent. Had a great cast, Al Pacino and Robin Williams outstanding as per usual, interesting to see Pacino in a movie like this, a little different for him as well, in my opinion, he played his role masterfully.Is it worth watching? Yes, it is, if you want to see Nolan/Pacino from another perspective, i recommend watching it, you will not be shocked, it is a little intense and some parts are quite interesting.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Christopher Nolan, the director of Memento, does a good enough job with the material.  However, the material isn't good at all.  Same old repeated cop story throughout history, the good cop with a tainted past who had to bend the rules at some point to get a guy he knew was guilty.  If you enjoy cliche ridden characters, i guess this movie is for you.  If you're looking for originality, unfortunately, keep looking.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not Memento, but hardly without merit","I have not watched the original behind this(I know, I know... and I'm even Nordic), but intend to do so if I get the chance. No need to keep secret the fact that I primarily made it a point to get a viewing of this because of its director. I was not disappointed. The visuals, the editing... effective and utilizing a nice range of what is possible in film-making, a clear grasp on the tools, without it ever being flashy or not having a purpose. The version I saw was on TV, so it could very well have been edited from the original version, please keep that in mind if something I say seems to be in complete contrast to what you thought. The plot is very good and develops interestingly throughout(some of them are... well, you'll see). The pace is not bad, if not all that fast. That is not to say that this doesn't hold tension... when it needs to, it's got it in spades. The acting is credible and skillful more or less for all the players. The cinematography and aforementioned cutting are masterful. Details captured, and the way in which the physical state is rendered... Christopher's career may have begun not too long ago, but I could definitely imagine that it will be worth following. It certainly has been so far. I recommend this to any fan of Nolan and/or Pacino. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good, but not great","In a year where the film product tumbling out of Hollywood is mediocre at best, ""Insomnia"" looks like a masterpiece.  Not quite.  Christopher Nolan's followup to the inimitable ""Memento"" doesn't quite reach those heghts of originality.  The movie is good, but not the great piece of filmmaking that most critics would have you believing it is.Why?  Al Pacino has done the Weary Cop Thing before (think ""Sea of Love"") so playing this part isn't much of a stretch, and I personally think he's a bit old to be playing the cop and chasing suspects over floating logs etc. Hilary Swank still hasn't found a sufficient followup role after her triumph in ""Boys Don't Cry,"" and she basically follows the Pacino character around. Most importantly, what hampers ""Insomnia 2002"" is the Hollywood ending, the obligatory shootout, the baddies are subdued, and good triumphs.  I expected more ambiguity and less predictability from a truly innovative director like Nolan, and he let me down.  Succumbing to the standard Hollywood finale may ensure Nolan a lengthy and profitable career in Tinseltown, but a sellout is a sellout is a sellout.To digress a bit, wouldn't ""Panic Room"" have been a more effective movie if Forrest Whitaker just left with the loot, didn't return to the house, and left Jodie Foster to her own devices?  Now that's an ending, not perfect one, not a happy one, but better than what was given to the moviegoer.I'm not a Robin Williams fan, but I sincerely hope he's remembered next February when Oscar nominations roll out.  He was creepy, calculating, pathetic, and simply scary in his part.  As for everyone else, I say it's on to the next project.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
How To Make A Remake CORRECTLY,"For many years, I have said repeatedly that there is zero point in producing a remake of a film because there is literally no way that it can succeed from a filmmaking standpoint. It creates a weird paradox where the audience already knows what happens before it happens, and its impossible for a remake to top the original because creators of remakes don't fully understand the intention behind the original project. After seeing this film, I realize that I might have been wrong, and that good remakes are actually possible, as long as they are done like this.Sir Christopher Nolan is an intelligent director, and he likes to spend a lot of time making intellectual films that go deep in the psyche of his characters. The original ""Insomnia"" (1997) is a Norwegian film which is a good movie, but my main criticism of it was that it didn't go deep enough in the exploration of its themes. Nolan's interpretation on the other hand, does. It's the same story, but with a more focused narrative. It's in this that you can see what makes this remake good. The course of events is the exact same as the original, but with a few minor changes, the theme of corruption and guilt more interestingly presented.The general rule for characters in this movie is that they are all trying to do good in the most general sense, but they do evil in the minor sense. Look at the main character for instance: Will Dormer's flaw is that he is willing to break small laws as long as he locks away a generally bad person who would otherwise cause harm. This is why he is so aggressive with suspects, why he is willing to throw an innocent girl around a landfill just for answers and is ultimately willing to cooperate with a murderer to keep dangerous criminals off the street. He thinks he can get away with all of this, which he doesn't, because he's a victim of his own guilt in the form of insomnia and ultimately gives up on this way of carrying out his goals, allowing the truth about him to be spread regardless of consequences.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Starring Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and Hilary Swank, the film follows two detectives investigating a murder in a small Alaskan town where the sun never sets during the summer months.Detectives Will Dormer (played by Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhart (played by Martin Donovan) are sent from Los Angeles to Nightmute, Alaska, to assist in solving the murder of a local teenager. During the investigation, Dormer accidentally shoots and kills his partner in the foggy Alaskan wilderness, but he covers it up to avoid scandal and continue the investigation.As the days stretch on without darkness, Dormer finds it increasingly difficult to sleep, leading to a state of insomnia that begins to affect his judgment and perception of reality. Meanwhile, the prime suspect in the murder case, crime novelist Walter Finch (played by Robin Williams), begins to manipulate Dormer, exploiting his guilt and sleep deprivation.The film is a masterclass in tension and suspense, with Nolan's direction creating a palpable atmosphere of unease and paranoia. Al Pacino delivers a riveting performance as the conflicted detective, portraying Dormer's descent into moral ambiguity with nuance and intensity. Robin Williams delivers a chilling turn as the enigmatic suspect, playing against type as a manipulative and sinister character.""Insomnia"" explores themes of guilt, morality, and the consequences of one's actions. As Dormer grapples with his guilt over his partner's death and his own ethical compromises, the line between right and wrong becomes increasingly blurred.The remote Alaskan setting adds to the film's sense of isolation and claustrophobia, with the perpetual daylight serving as a metaphor for Dormer's inability to escape his own conscience.Overall, ""Insomnia"" is a gripping and thought-provoking thriller that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats until the very end.

Another Nolan piece of mastery that the mediocre will pass off as mediocre.,"For those of you unable to uncover the depth in a film you will think this film is nothing more than a typical twisted murder mystery. Nice try because it is everything but normal popcorn fare. This is not a normal good cop/bad cop scenerio like many of us without the trained or patient eye will believe. The film is full of quick flashback imagery that works to lead you up to one detail in the past that may clue you in to why Will( Al Pacino) is in the sticky situation he is in back in L.A. The remainder of the storyline up to the very end serves as a sort of ambiguity letting the audience decide if his intentions are good or bad. Walter(Robin Williams) is the trigger character as the sharp murderer. This is the most honest work I have ever seen Robin Williams pull off as he plays the psycho that seemingly leads Will farther down the wrong path. Hillary Swank plays Ellie, the young eager cop anxious on her first real murder case. If any character lacked the slightest bit of roundness it was this one, yet she ends up playing a pivotal piece of the puzzle.The editing in this film is beyond amazing...perhaps the best I have seen in recent years. The flashbacks mixed with the effects of Will's insomnia give the audience Will's mood from the beginning to the end. As usual, Chris Nolan's attention to detail is unbelievable. The only flaws of this film occur in the characterization. Will( Al Pacino) seems to flow in and out of his accent. Otherwise, this film is one perfect work.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Thriller and moral conflicts,"In thrillers, if you can easily predict the ending then the fun is destroyed. In this film you can predict the ending but still the story keeps you strung.

What makes this film watchable other than Al Pacino is its chilling chase sequences in the foggy waters of Alaska. The close-up shots of the actors and of movements of hands, eyes, etc were prominent. The location of the shoot totally echoed the sort of uncanny and lonely feel it needed. The way Pacino's character changes and his inner conflict is related to Insomnia, which is prominent right from the start and he shows signs of physical deterioration which grow with the moral burdens he is carrying throughout the film.

Welcome The Young Hitchcock,"There are movies, many kinds of movies, as the art of movie making evolves many genres have evolved and these many genres in their wake have left behind precious treasures.Popular genre and unpopular genres populate the film landscape:  one among them literally invented by Alfred Hitchcock was the `Noir'.Let us study the meaning of Noir; a search on the web would give you the following meanings.· A genre of crime literature featuring tough, cynical characters and bleak settings. · Suggestive of danger or violence.Insomnia, Directed by Christopher Nolan, is true to the above meaning, The movie is based on a movie called the Insomnia, written by a two Norwegians, Nikolaj Frobenius and Erik Skjoldbjaerg, The first insomnia is a Norwegian film directed Erik Skjoldbjaerg,A super cop and his partner arrive in Alaska from L.A. to assist the police there to solve the murder of a 17 year old girl, an investigation into the super cops past is suggested and a strange rift is established between the cops that arrive from L.A. the body leads to the killer the killer is trapped and while in pursuit within the Alaskan fog the super cop shoots at killer but kills the partner, the Killer is witness to this and begins to black mail the Super cop, It's a mistake but because of the investigation on his past practices the   super cop goes to  some lengths to cover up. Lengths like, a false report, routing the bullet to the murderer and a string of others.Set in the Alaskan brightness, The mood is bleak a constant cloud overhang and the light continuing thru the night, The story is simple we know the murder and the murderer almost immediately and there is not much intrigue there. Infect there is no intrigue at all, but in abundance is the talent of the director, the talent of the actors and the handling of their respective talents. There are some directors like Sam Mendes who succor on the color of his characters and let them lead the mood and there are some that succor on the plot and lets the plot dictate the mood. The later is definably Hitchcock and in this our times it is another Britain, Chris Nolan. This above arguments supportive display is Insomnia.The super cop, Detective Will Dormer' is Al Pacino and the murderer is Walter Finch' Robin Williams, the detective Ellie Burr' is Hilary Swank assists and adores Dormers work, Ellie burr character carries a streak of non-ironic in the filed of cynical characters, like a bright flower in a barren farm. One claims the other and highlights other.  -I had consciously excluded her from the plot synopsis because her character is constructed within the story like eyes within the human body, She is present in a vital character but not significant to the vacant obvious plot, By way of revealing the story thru the bright flower the rather dark story has a shadow of brightness to it. The afore mentioned plot is just the infrastructure a Chess board, a rich, dark yet an amazing mood within which minds of the characters move, where the plot and the mood do the tango.The Plot is obvious the movement of the characters is obvious and so why did I drag my wife to the movie for my second and her first? Good Movies are like cherished moments, like those photographs that are tucked in those album jackets and extract emotion or related emotions from you very now and then. Like those Hitchcock's in your library. They are revisited again and again, probably for a scene or a string of them. This is a Movie that has no intrigue that draws the audience but draws you in for its directorial genius that ties in tough cynical characters in a bleak setting with a suggestion of danger.So is it wrong to place it among the other Film Noir?",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Nolan's remake, with brilliant Al Pacino","Story follows two detectives who came into small town on Alaska to solve the crime. Detective Dormer (Al Pacino) accidentally shots his partner Detective Eckhart (Martin Donovan) when they were catching the murderer. But Dormer doesn't admits his mistake and instead of that he gives an alibi. Local cop Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank) is trying to figure out what happened that day and how/why did Dormer shoot Eckhart.Christopher Nolan delivered ""Insomnia"" after his masterpiece ""Memento"" and he really didn't left me disappointed. ""Insomnia"" is remake of Norwegian movie with the same title (with Stellan Skarsgård in main role). Since I didn't watched Skjoldbjærg's movie I cannot compare both of them but I can write some of my thoughts about Nolan's remake.You can really make psychological profile of every single character and then you can explain their behavior. So, Dormer is old detective that knows everything about his job, but he makes mistake when he accidentally shoots his partner and then cover up everything. Why? Well he cares about his reputation and he also has investigation on his back in L.A. He's bothered with insomnia and when he manages to fall asleep he always dreams that unfortunate scene. Al Pacino played Dormer with perfection. He has a perfect face to act man bothered with crime and insomnia. He's one of my favorite actors and here he shines.Man Dormer wants to catch is Walter Finch, sick man and a murderer. But Finch saw everything and Dormer must play his game. But are they so different? They both killed and they both aren't good guys. Here we have Robin Williams in not so usual role for him. But he managed to pull it off and he showed all skeptics (if those exist) what he is capable of.Opposite of Dormer and Finch there is young cop Ellie Burr, the only positive character. Although Ellie admires Dormer, she does investigation and notices irregularity in Dormer's report. She is ambitious and she eventually finds out the truth. Hilary Swank did her usually good job and she's natural talent cause she's not educated actress.At the end right people deserves to die and Dormer says the most important sentence of the movie: ""Don't lose yourself!""(or something like that), when Ellie wanted to throw the bullet away.So at the end of my comment I must recommend this movie and original too. This one because of Nolan/Pacino/Williams/Swank collaboration and the original because of...(we shall see).",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I will have to see the original Insomnia before I can judge what Nolan contributed to this movie because Insomnia was a movie carried by the plot more than anything else.Williams and Pacino were terrific, as usual, and surprisingly Swank was good as the up and coming detective.

"Nolan's ""Graduation Film"" Is No Memento","I am a huge fan of Christopher Nolan.  I believe he has the potential to be one of the great directors of his generation.  But, how do you follow-up something like Memento?  Obviously a brilliant effort.  Insomnia, not so.  A puzzling effort.  The biggest puzzle of the summer.  It has flashes of brilliance but the final package just has no intensity about it.  Anxious yes.  Thought-provoking only enough to make the premise interesting, nothing more.  Intense no.  The establishing of the narrative's dynamic is handled with great care and expertise by Nolan.  Both Al Pacino and Robin Williams render fine performances.  Pacino will surely get a Best Actor nomination (and perhaps win compared with the other performances I've seen so far this year.)  The cinematography was very well executed.  The film captures Detective Dormer's increasing isolation, desperation, the effects of sleeplessness on his thinking and professional drive, his inability to shut out light (his sense of guilt), the emerging doubt about his true motivations as he sinks ever deeper into a morass of lies in order to pursue a truth all these elements were superbly handled.  And yet, in the end, the flashes of brilliance don't add up to anything special.  The ambiguity, Nolan's trademark, works well on a moral and simple plot level but what is the context?  Unlike in Following and Memento, there is ambiguity without genuine context in Insomnia.  Ultimately, despite the well-told story, it fails to live up to its potential.  Still, the elements were well enough developed and directed to justify labeling Insomnia as Nolan's `graduation piece.'  He has made the transition from art house to mainstream director. It will be interesting to see where he goes from here.  I'd give it an 8. Despite its flaws, Insomnia is one of the best offerings we've seen this mediocre summer.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Nolan's 'training wheels' film,"Right now, most people know Christopher Nolan for his critically-acclaimed Batman trilogy. Others who know a little more about his work link him with some pretty intense science fiction, fantasy or generally twisted movies like Inception, The Prestige and Memento.However, before all of those classics, he did a remake of a Scandinavian film, Insomnia. I haven't seen the original, so I can't compare to that. Although, as it wasn't originally his story, he didn't have as much input on the screenplay as he normally does. It's about a couple of cops from LA (one being the strung-out Al Pacino) who come to a small town in Alaska where it doesn't get dark for six months of the year, to investigate a murdered girl. Enter Robin Williams - the main suspect and Al's nemesis.With those two acting heavyweights, you can never really say that Insomnia is a bad film. It ticks all the boxes. Everyone puts in a decent performance and I can't really see anyone who likes detective-type movies being disappointed. However, when you compare it to Nolan's other work, it does seem like a step down in quality. I can only think he prefers working on his own screenplays. Either way, don't let that put you off. It does the job and it's definitely worth a watch (as are most of Al Pacino's films!).",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The lead actor, Skellan Shaasgard, is as good as they come, outshining Al Pacino, and the direction is better.  Nolan is talented but he doesn't do anything here exceptional.

"Short review of Insomnia, no spoilers.","Excellent film, even though you know exactly what's going on. There is no actual mystery there. It is, however, still intensely suspenseful. All of the mysteries are internal ones. Questions of morality, guilt, suspicion, right and wrong, decisions that change everything. You never know who is going to jump what way... and how insomnia affects perception and judgment.There are good guys and bad guys, and it's easy to see the ones at the extremes, but in the murky half-light hide the grey hats, the ones you can't trust to be good or bad. So what do you do? There's where the suspense lies...And it is good.I was never TRULY a fan of Al Pacino's (maybe I just haven't watched Dog Day Afternoon all the way through) until this film. His craggy face lends itself to his role, and he is best when he is understated, pulled back, reined in. It's good.Who's the villain? Well, watch it and see...Cinematography in this film is almost another character unto itself. The camera plays tricks on you, leads you on, asks questions you have no answer for until the bitter end. The story is presented visually, exactly how it should be. You know from the first moments of the credits that Something Is Going On.

"Very good actors and director, mediocre movie.","First of all I am a huge Pacino fan.  He can seem to overact at times and this seems to be one of them.  The movie never grabs your attention like you want it to.  Robin Williams is good but seems to have an easy part to play in the movie.  I was really looking forward to this movie when I found out is was from Christopher Nolan, and maybe that is why I seem to bash this movie more than others.  It is a good movie just not what you want it to be.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A good thriller,"I had some expectations when I saw this movie. Its almost impossible not to create them, when we have before us a film by the prestigious Christopher Nolan, with actors as strong as Al Pacino, Hillary Swank and Robin Williams (the latter - rare case - in a role of dramatic villain). Only later did I come to discover that this was a remake of another Norwegian film, which I never saw.The script is based on a police investigation into a crime in Alaska, where the Sun has the peculiarity of, at the peak of Summer, never to disappear from the horizon. Will Dormer, a Los Angeles cop, goes there, but he's not used to the environment or the white nights, so he cannot sleep. Something that worsens as the remorse for his past haunts the investigation.Nolan is a skilled director with unquestionable ability. However, this movie is far from his best. In fact, if we didn't know that he was in, this movie could perfectly well be any other good American director. But there are moments of brilliance: the way insomnia was portrayed, the way the white Alaskan landscape was used to make the place oppressive, mysterious and inhospitable... The script, in turn (in one of the rare films where Nolan avoided getting involved in writing), has more of a turnaround and can get our attention. Although we know very early on who is the criminal and the great villain, the film focuses on the figure of the policeman, calling into question his way of doing justice, avoiding making him a hero, just as he avoids making the victim an innocent figure. The murdered young woman, in fact, was not a choir girl.Al Pacino was perfectly up to the challenge and along with Williams dominates the entire film. This duo of striking actors is fundamental and was able to do what it took to make their characters strong and domineering. Right behind, we can appreciate Hilary Swank, an actress whose performances have not always appealed to me in other films, but who was very well here.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pretty absorbing film,"This film is a pretty good one. It's absorbing insofar that it draws in the viewer. The acting is pretty good by everyone, but no one really shines in this one. That often hurts a film with a big name in it (in this case, Pacino), but not in this case. Rather, it's a collaborative effort and the film benefits from the combination of talents. The story is engrossing enough to hold the viewer and the sheer beauty of Alaska definitely helps in keeping the viewer's interest, too. Definitely worth a rental.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"great acting, great writing, great directing. Insomnia is the strongest movie so far this year.","Just saw Insomnia and was blown away by it. It showed that if the writing is strong, the acting award-caliber, and the directing effective, then a thriller does not need to be a twisted winding road connected by the plot surprises. This is a straightforward story that, while not neccessarily predictable, doesn't rely on pulling a 180 on the audience. Al Pacino does his usual tough guy thing, with the twist being that he doesn't get to sleep during the six days over which this movie occurs. Robin Williams is spectacular. He has long been panned for doing 'family stuff' (without reason, oftentimes), and certainly does something entirely different here.I went into Insomnia with high expectations, and all of them were met and exceeded.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
More Great Work From Nolan; Masterful Work From Pacino,"Al Pacino has always been known and rewarded for his loud, showy, abrasive, and larger-than-life characters.  He's garnered Oscar nominations for big, in-your-face roles such as in Dick Tracy and The Godfather, and finally won for Scent of a Woman, in which his gargantuan, wild performance literally carried an otherwise average film.  That's why it's such a shock and treat to see him playing the lead character, Detective Will Dormer, in Insomnia as a man so lost and broken in spirit that you can see the failure, defeat, and exhaustion on his face.  This isn't a variation of his shouting, impassioned, bordering-on-caricature personas; it's a performance of subtlety and depth as he slowly becomes bogged down by both guilt and lack of sleep.  In short, it may be Pacino's best performance of his career.L. A. detectives Will Dormer and partner Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) arrive in the small Alaskan town of Nightmute (sumptuously photographed) to assist local police in the murder of a young girl. The town is in the middle of a 6-month period of constant twilight, with the sun never going down and light pervading all, adding to Dormer's sleeplessness. Ellie Burr (Hillary Swank, in a perfunctory role), a rookie cop, serves as their guide and helps with the investigation.  Dormer and Eckhart are in conflict; Eckhart threaten sto give information to the LAPD about misconduct on Dormer's part.  During a chase for the killer, Dormer accidentally shoots his partner.  The killer sees this, and uses it to blackmail him into helping him flee police capture.At the midway point, the murderer is revealed, and is played by Robin Williams.  Again, here is a performer known for his energetic and spontaneous work in a variety of comedy and family films.  Under Nolan's direction, Williams turns in a creepy cool performace, underplaying his role and imbuing the character with an intangible, offbeat quality.  With the two main performers doing such quality work, it's sad that Hillary Swanks' role was not more fleshed out.  Her job is too basically be in peril when the script calls for it or act suspicious.  It's not so much that it's a poorly written character, it's just that  a great performer deserves a great role.Director Christopher Nolan has directed another fine thriller with Insomnia. Of course its much more conventional than Memento, but that's to be expected and really can't be held against a top-notch mindgame such as this. He gets fantastic performances out of his cast, especially Pacino with his masterful onscreen deterioration of his character. A well-paced and engrossing film, with just the right amount of action and  a fascinating and thoughtful psychological dance between the two main characters. Nolan is filling the niche he carved himself in the suspense genre with more quality work.8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Murder and Manipulation in the Unrelenting Alaskan Daylight,"Christopher Nolan brings us this eerie, methodical thriller about an Alaskan murder case, successfully adapting and re-working a 1997 Norwegian film of the same name. Insomnia's intrigue lies not in its hunt for the killer - a small-time writer named Finch (Robin Williams) makes very little effort to mask his guilt - but in how he uses sensitive information and unusual atmospheric conditions to misdirect and blackmail the lead officer. Flown in to crack the case, superstar LAPD police detective Dormer (Al Pacino) is compromised when he can't acclimate to the region's 24-hour daylight cycle, spending several sleepless nights in a rented bed. This, plus an impending internal affairs investigation and an accident in the field, places him in a troubled state of mind that's ripe for his target's manipulations.Pacino and Williams produce several excellent, contentious scenes together, though the latter doesn't appear in-person until halfway through the film. Pacino, a patient and confident character at the outset, balances vocal frustration with nuanced confusion as the hours mount and he begins to lose his grip on reality. Williams, meanwhile, is downright chilling in the rare villainous role, leveraging his normally-jovial energy abundance into something that feels more nervous and unsettling in the strange new light. Great performances, well-managed by an emerging director who may not have completely trusted his own instincts quite yet. Insomnia is most effective when Nolan uses the camera to explore Dormer's visions and hallucinations, misleading us right alongside the self-professed ""good cop,"" but those scenes feel under-represented. It's a more traditional story in their stead, with only hints of the ambitious narrative gambits that would come to define his later works. Effective, but somewhat less challenging than your typical Nolan mind-bender.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

At times the scenes are too long and only thanks to Al Pacino's excellent performance you won't yawn or longing for the imminent end... Robbie Williams and Hilary Swank are also worth watching but they spend much less time on the screen than Pacino.

Good Movie.,"To be brutally honest, I wasn't really too stoked about seeing this movie. What I mean to say is that it looked good, but it didn't really strike me as anything great from the previews.  Also, I must say that I was less than stoked about Christopher Nolan directing (I wasn't a fan of ""Memento"", it was ok, but nothing great).  Well, needless to say, I ended up going to see this movie anyway.  I must concede that I liked the movie a great deal more than I thought I would.  Even about half way through the film I wasn't sure if I was really liking where the film was going, but by the end I was happy with the film.Again, I have to be brutally honest, I'm not a huge fan of Al Pacino. I've liked a bunch of his movies, but I don't think he's anything terribly great. But, I thought he did a great job in this film.  I've always been a huge fan of Robin Williams, this was quite a different role for him, but he pulled it off.  It was a little odd to see him as the antagonist, but he did a great job.  Hillary Swank (another person that I think is a pretty good actor/actress, but nothing great) did a great job too, and looked really good.  The rest of the cast did a fine job too, Maura Tierney, Nicky Katt, Jonathan Jackson, etc...The story was quite interesting, and did a great job of keeping you interested.  I thought the story did a great job of keeping you guessing whether or not Robin Williams' character was telling the truth of lying. I can't really say any more than that, or else I'll give away the good parts of the film.I thought this was a really good film, and definitely worth watching.  I wouldn't say it was anywhere near the best movie I've ever seen, but it was quite good.  I hope that you like the film as much as I do.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Nolan is Masterful!,"The grandiloquent directors of our time have the niche to implement a certain theme into masterful storytelling. One of them is Director Christopher Nolan. No one could forget his ingenious direction for last year's sleeper hit `Memento'. He has done the same for this year's unsleeper hit `Insomnia'. If you forgot, `Memento' focused on a short-term memory loss amnesiac who utilized mementos devices such as inscribed tattoos and polaroid photographs as aids to his disability in order to solve a murder mystery. In `Insomnia', it focuses on an insomniac detective who uses his crafty police-work and his masterful discretion as aids to his disability in order to solve a murder mystery. Al Pacino stars as the restless detective. His performance should open the eyes to academy award voters during oscar time. The godfather of all actors proves once again why there is not a challenging role he can't refuse. I was quite `alarmed' to see Robin Wiliams playing the heavy; but he was quite impressive as the sadistic psycho. Also, Hilary Swank does deserve accolades for her role as the junior inquisitive police officer. However, the true light of the film that opened my eyes widely was the innovative direction of Christopher Nolan. This 32 year old brit is one of the best bright minds of theatrical filmmaking. So see the light at the end of the tunnel (or at the end of the movie theatre line) and see `Insomnia' today!***** Excellent",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
a fake psychological thriller,"I didn't like Insomnia as much as I'd hoped. Insomnia is a psychological thriller different from the others, but in my opinion at some point it becomes a boring movie about a simple cop who after accidentally killing his colleague, tries not to take the blame by making up an alibi. I think sometimes it's too repetitive and then it's very badly organized in terms of timing, this time Nolan failed. The positive notes of the film are Al Pacino and Robin Williams, although the character I liked the most is that of Hilary Swank, Ellie Burr. The first part of the film is very nice, exciting and intriguing; but then when the killer comes into play, it changes totally genre in my opinion, there is no more a minimum of tension, fear, having to understand what the protagonists are doing etc. Real thriller are Prisoners, Seven, but also just mention another Nolan movie, Memento. It's still a nice movie, but I don't expect Nolan to fall..

More action oriented than the psychological Norwegian original,"""Insomnia"" (2002) by Christopher Nolan is a remake of the 1997 Norwegian original by Erik Skjoldbjaerg. Nolan relocates the action from Lapland to Alaska. More important however is that the remake is more polished and less raw than the original in at least two ways.In the first place the images of the landscape in the Nolan version are very beautiful. In the Norwegian version however the misty landscape better reflects the mood of the troubled detective.Secondly the Nolan version is more action oriented, while in the Skjoldbjaerg version the detective fights a more psychological struggle with himself.The confrontation in the Nolan version is not only between the detective (inspector Dormer played by Al Pacino) and his suspect (Walter Finch played by Robin Williams), but also between the detective and internal affairs. Dormer considers employees of internal affairs as a sort of failed cops that didn't have the courage to become a real cop. When we find out however that in an earlier case he fabricated evidence to get someone convicted his intuition told him was guilty our evaluation of interal affairs becomes somewhat more nuanced. All in all in both films the detective is a complicated character and certainly not the proverbial good guy.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It's so easy to kill someone,It's really so easy to kill someone even when you don't want to. Or is it that you really didn't want to? What is conscience? What is guilt? Does the end justify the means? What is a good cop? What is a bad one? Someone already said that a good cop is the one who solves more crimes than those he commits himself. This is all what this movie is about and the story evolves in the beautiful and almost unreal landscape of Alaska in summer when there is no sunset and insomnia seizes bodies and minds. The first images are terribly ominous showing an almost unwordly landscape seen from the air and they are made even more ominous by a music sound track of heavy and overwhelming density and sullenness. Al Pacino is great is the role of the super-detective who nevertheless has got his Achilles heel and what a big one. Robin Williams on the contrary seems not very much at ease in his first role of a villain. Anyway this is a good movie and in my opinion much worth to be seen.,7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Un-Nolan-Like,"One of Nolan's earlier films, this movie was the least encompassing of his style of any of his others.

Not as good as the original,"This remake of the 1997 Norwegian film by the same title is something of a disappointment, not because it is worse than the original (which it is), but because Christopher Nolan, the director, is hot off of his brilliant film Memento.  As unconventional as that film was, that is how conventional his Insomnia is.  This is due mainly to the important ways in which Al Pacino's character Agent Dormer (why didn't they just call him Agent ""Sleeper,"" hmm?) has been softened up from the original character, played by Stellan Skarsgård.  If you've seen both films, you'll know which scenes I am thinking about.  Maybe these changes are due to American audiences' sentiment that their heroes be unambiguously good, without a dark side.  Or, maybe Al Pacino's ego required that the character be more heroic.  In any case, the character has lost any trace of originality, which was really the only saving grace of the original film.  Why and how this film came to be remade in such an uninspired fashion is beyond me.  It is my hope that Christopher Nolan's next film shows a bit more spark than this one.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of Nolan's earlier works,"There are two types of people out there; one, who deem Insomnia to be one of their favorite Nolan directorial, and two, who find the same to be lacking in several aspects, especially if compared to Nolan's more recent outings. Even if I belong to the latter group, I can reason with both sides of the argument in quite an equal tone!On the one hand, it is a competent plot that displays a certain flair and urgency that keeps us hooked but on the other hand, the movie plays out more like a drama than a conventional thriller, And I say this because the script had more to show about detective Dormer and his mental struggles rather than focusing on what kind of rationales might have driven the killer to commit the wrong.Now it's a creative choice, and I am in no place to judge but I will tell you this, had he taken the more orthodox or formulaic (so to speak) path, his film would have fared much better. It's not terrible, but nothing great either.P. S. I know people have raved so much about Al Pacino's performance, and yes, he's without a doubt a tremendous actor who deserves every single bit of the compliments but what about Robin Williams (R. I.

His portrayal of someone suffering from sleep deprivation was so real that we couldn't understand why it wasn't more recognizable to those acting with him. Robin Williams was able to overcome his typecasting and was perfectly believable as a calculating villain. Hillary Swank did an excellent job of morphing her character as the plot developed. There were a couple of scenes where one had to willingly suppress disbelief, such as when Pacino spent about a minute trapped below surface in frigid waters after a vigorous pursuit sequence. Then there was the fog that mysteriously thickened at the worst possible moment. The conclusion of the film was plausible but not completely satisfying. I would have liked more twists throughout.

Taut detective thriller,"Director Christopher Nolan made a sensational splash with the indie hit ""Memento"", earning him this shot at the big time. For the most part, he proved himself up to the task. ""Insomnia"" provides a multilayered psychological thriller where two distinct storylines are interwoven in the character of Will Dormer (Al Pacino). The workup is a bit contrived, with Dormer coming to Alaska from LA to help out an old buddy with a murder investigation as he is himself being investigated by internal affairs. This serves as a foundation for the two storylines. The first is the animosity that develops between Dormer and his partner, who wants to cut a deal with internal affairs. The second, of course, is the murder investigation. After Dormer accidentally (?) shoots his partner while chasing the suspect in dense fog, the psychological games begin. Local detective Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank), who is fawning all over Dormer and has read all his books on detective work, begins to suspect that her hero may have feet of clay.The psychodrama becomes intense as Dormer is confronted with communications from his killer nemesis Walter Finch (Robin Williams), while suspicions swirl around the death of his partner. Add to this his inability to get any sleep in Alaska's perpetual daylight and you have a man driven to the absolute brink.Nolan does an excellent job of shooting this film and the editing intensifies the psychological tension. The cinematography is also superb, aided by the majestic Alaskan and British Columbian locations. While the interaction between Dormer and Finch is unlikely, the symbiotic relationship that develops is fascinating and Nolan squeezes every psychological tingle that can be wrung from it.Pacino is masterful as the insomniac cop who has made certain ethical compromises in his career in the name of justice. He looks so terrible that he must have been purposely depriving himself of sleep to increase the realism of the character. Pacino gives Dormer (an interesting play on the latin dormire, ""to sleep"", a dormer is the window of a sleeping room) a hard edge that gradually erodes as he becomes more sleep deprived, blurring the distinction between good and evil.Robin Williams seems to be trying to shed his nice guy image with back to back wackos. He follows up his sociopathic performance in ""One Hour Photo"" with this character who is a sort of sinister pragmatist. Williams is at his best when he is pushing sanity's limits, whether that be in zany comedy or maniacal mayhem, which is precisely why he was wrong for this part. This character is far too calculating and controlled for Williams talents and the part is also much too physical for him. He is just not convincing as a cold blooded killer and tough guy. That is not to say it was a bad performance, just the wrong actor. Hilary Swank unfortunately doesn't have much to do in a film that is dominated by Pacino and Williams.This is an excellent big budget debut for Nolan and another terrific performance by Pacino.

take a bow Mr.Pacino,"for giving probably the best performance of the year in this riveting thriller by Christopher Nolan .

Good movie,"but not great.  I don't see where the raves are coming from.  Granted, the acting is good.  While Pacino was...well...Pacino, I thought the rest of the cast was excellent.  The direction was well-done - the scenery was stunning, moods were captured perfectly, etc.  My problem is the story line.  I thought it was old and cliched, and I haven't even seen the original movie. It was very predictable.Maybe my problem is that my expectations were too high...I saw the previews: Christopher Nolan - excellent; Pacino, Williams, Swank - great; Alaska - great;  the pieces seemed to be there to go above and beyond Memento and Following.  I felt that the pieces were not put together - mostly, but not fully.It's very much the same feeling I had after seeing ""Unbreakable"" because of the high hopes I had since seeing ""The Sixth Sense.""  I know these directors are capable of so much.  That's why I'll still be in line to see whatever's next from both of these new masters.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hitchcock for the new millennium?,"OK, maybe this may pushing it a wee, teency bit, but I have a funny tingling feeling that Chris Nolan could be on his way to becoming the best British export since the late Alfred Hitchcock. Pushing it a bit? Maybe. However, his Thrillers are growing in stature now and the creation of tension is superb.Insomnia features a sterling cast performance, obviously with Messrs Pacino and Williams deserving a lot of credit in their part of creating very strong characters. Pacino's performance as the tormented insomniac detective Will Dormer is as magnificent as it is subtle. His haggard face lifeless as he grows into a deeper spiral of sleep deprivation, guilt and despair. This is definatley as good as any work Pacino has done before. Williams is quite a revelation as the twisted Walter Finch and wholly believable. Hilary Swank in the supporting role as the eager young detective is as usual great.The atmosphere in the film is it's crowning glory, the collision between the claustrophobic interiors of the Police station and Walter Finch's home to the vast and beautiful Alaskan vistas. The lack of action gives way to a superb psychological battle between Dormer and Finch giving a great Hitchcock-esque (there I said it) final sequence.

ever heard of tylenol pm?,"Personally, this movie stunk. The continuity was screwed up. The longer Will (Pacino) went sleepless, the more sounds started to bother him, only this occurred in certain scenes, but not in others. What happened to them? Why did they only interrupt his thoughts when he was in the police station but not on the ferry? And Williams as a bad guy is just bad. I couldn't understand why Will didn't just by some sleeping pills, like Unisom or Tylenol PM. There are ways to make a person go to sleep. I know this is supposed to contribute to the ""thriller"" theme of this movie, but it was just garbled and unorganized.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Decent thriller; Nolan can do better,"The eternal daylight is tormenting inspector Will Dormer (Al Pacino), who has been sent to Alaska from Los Angeles with a colleague. Due to his lack of sleep and the dense fog, Dormer accidentally shoots his colleague while hunting the killer. He decides to cover up that misstep. This empowers the killer (Robin Williams), who has seen everything. The hunter and his prey turn out to be evenly matched.It can be seen that Insomnia is more precious than the chilly, pale Norwegian original - starting with the opening scene. As a concession to its intended audience, the story lost its sharpest edges. For instance, Dormer does not shoot a dog; that would make him too unsympathetic.The American version delivers text and explanation every so often about background and motives of the tormented cop, which makese the film getting off to a slow start and regularly loses momentum.Insomnia is nothing more and nothing less than a skillfully made thriller. Nolan's third film is the calling card he needed to conquer Hollywood, without losing too much of his artistic freedom.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Once is not enough!,"Christopher Nolan's ""Insomnia"" is so good, so full of intriguing detail, that I found it even more enjoyable on second viewing than on the first. The direction is first-rate, and the acting, especially Pacino's, is generally better than good. The really good news about ""Insomnia"" is that it's at least as good as, and arguably better than, the original film on which it's based. This isn't always the case when Hollywood re-makes a ""foreign-language"" film for the big screen and the big names.There are several good reasons for the artistic success of ""Insomnia"" (2002). First, is the choice of Christopher Nolan as director. The man really does know how to use his camera and his actors: clearly, his ""Memento"" of two years ago was no flash-in-the-pan success. Another reason for the film's success is that the screenplay was written by Nikolaj Frobenius and Erik Skjoldbjærg, who also wrote the 1997 Norwegian original. (Skjoldbjærg also directed the original.) I can only speculate on their feelings about having the opportunity to re-do their own fine film, to expand on the original concept, take it to a new setting, broaden the characters, and fill in some of the blanks in the story.Although the two versions of ""Insomnia"" are different in many ways, the basic plot outline is the same. A young woman is murdered, her body cleaned of all useful forensic evidence - except that the very cleaning is evidence of a kind - and left on a rubbish heap. A famous police detective is brought in from the south to assist the ""locals"" in solving the crime: from Los Angeles to Alaska in the current film; from Sweden to northern Norway in the original. In both cases, the locale is in the far north, in the summer, when the sun never sets. The southerner finds the continuous daylight disorientating, with night turned into day, and his sleep patterns are disrupted - hence the film's title.In the course of the investigation, during a stake-out gone wrong, the famous detective shoots and kills his partner, and then attempts to pin the killing on the young woman's murderer, through manipulation of the physical evidence. In each case, the rest of the film is an exploration of the detective's sense of guilt, his bizarre relationship with the murderer, who has witnessed the shooting, and his increasing instability from lack of sleep.The back-stories of the two films are very different. Detective Will Dormer (Pacino) arrives in Alaska with a lot more baggage than can be carried by hand. He's fabricated evidence in a gruesome abduction/murder case, and he's under investigation by Internal Affairs. His partner, Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) is about to cut a deal with I.A. to protect his own career. This provides the necessary tension between the two men to make the apparently accidental shooting suspect, not only in the viewer's mind, but also in Dormer's. In the original film, detective Jonas Engström (Stellan Skarsgård) also has a blot on his record, but there appears to be no I.A. investigation (or whatever the Swedish equivalent might be), and thus no real tension between the two detectives, beyond the fact that detective Erik Vik (Sverre Anker Ousdal), a much older man, is a bit of a plodder, cut from smoother cloth than Engström.The principal supporting role, that of the local female detective is also very different in the two films. In the current version, detective Ellie Burr (Swank) almost fawns over Dormer, and that characterisation creaked a little for me. Burr declares she has read all of Dormer's cases (how likely is that, really, since it appears that Dormer has been an L.A. detective for about 30 years?), and made a detailed study of one of his major cases during her stint at ""the academy"". In the original film, detective Hilde Hagen (Gisken Armand) is a seasoned, tough professional, who suffers no burden of hero-worship. For me that characterisation worked better. Happily, Swank's character grows as the film develops.I have mixed feelings about Robin Williams's role, possibly because it's a new take for him. (Which is all to the good: some of Williams's sentimental past performances require dangerously high doses of Gravol to sit through.) I thought that his character had rather too much to say for a demented killer, and in some scenes he was, as the English would say, ""too clever by half"". Overall, I would give his performance one-and-three-quarters thumbs up. I will say, however, that I liked the original - Bjørn Floberg  as the killer/writer Jon Holt - better. His characterisation had an edge, and a dangerous quality, that the Williams character lacked.One cannot say too much about Al Pacino's performance as Will Dormer. One review I read declared that the essence of the film is written on Pacino's rugged and wasted countenance. And that's true enough, but the greatest quality of his performance is in his eyes, in the depths of pain lodged in remembrance, the aspect of a decent man who has seen so much that he has, in his own last words, ""lost his way"". It's a brilliant turn. Pacino works the part for every nuance that it has, and then some.Skarsgård's take on detective Jonas Engström lacks the bravura quality of Pacino's Dormer. His character is less dramatic, more mundane, and the script gives the actor fewer opportunities for the ""big scene"". We never learn enough about him to have much reason to develop sympathy for his situation. The role is a great challenge, therefore, and Skarsgård does very well with it.Final note. ""Insomnia"" is beautifully filmed, the scenery rugged and spectacular. Those viewers who waited for the final credits to roll by will have discovered that the film, with the exception of the aerial footage of the ice fields at the start, was shot not in Alaska but in northern British Columbia. As a Canadian, that gave me added pleasure in this very fine film.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Good Film,"Insomnia is an interesting film.  The plot is not extremely original, but I don't think the plot was what Christopher Nolan wants his audience to focus on.  The most interesting thing about this film was the motivations of characters and how they interact with each other.  Al Pacino gives a superb performance as a tired insomniac detective and Robin William's character is a perfect counter to him.  Robin William's character also gives a wonderful performance that shows his versatility as an actor.  The shots and picture in this film are fantastic and are starkly different from Nolan's earlier film Memento.  Insomnia is a good film to see for any person who likes mysteries, thrillers or psychological films.  I give it 3 and half stars out of 4.  Excellent film.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Darkness where there is much light,"Really excellent, thoughtful and intelligent thriller.  Its been blessed with some top acting talent, all of whom have another meaty role to add to their resumes.  Even the supporting actors are in tune with the movie.Do not want to give away any plot points, nor am I positive I'd be able to. Its not that movie is confusing, but its strange in that I am not sure what I saw, exactly.  Movie has a weird mood to it and I can't think of anything else like it.Pacino has disappointed me recently, but he's back in top form here. Robin Williams took a difficult role and made it his, and he is excellent also. Hilary Swank makes the most of her role and her best scenes are worth waiting for.  Nicky Katt and Martin Donovan and Paul Dooley are also in the movie and all very good as always, and Katt even gets to tell a pretty funny joke near the end.  Also enjoyed Jonathan Jackson, who I thought was very good in 'The Deep End of the Ocean', and Maura Tierney, who each have one or two scenes.Movie is edited to the skies and that is also a good thing.  Near the end, when Pacino is screaming for a break, the editing makes you feel like he does.  By then you want to throw a valium at the screen to give Al some relief.Cinematography is excellent and the location where the movie is shot offers many picturesque views.Christopher Nolan is a top talent, and I can say that even though I didn't care for 'Memento' at all.

Watch This One Wide Awake,"Insomnia is another great movie from Christopher Nolan. While not as avant-garde as Memento or Following, it is still very suspenseful, and it makes the viewer focus on the moment rather than thinking about the sequence of events.What makes this movie interesting is that Dormer (Pacino) knows who his adversary is early on. Finch (Williams) makes Dormer suffer for the rest of the story, sometimes it seemed almost unbearable to see Dormer being tormented.As for the acting, Pacino, Williams, and Swank are well cast and gave remarkable performances. I expected good acting and an excellent story. However, I found the story good and the acting excellent. Will Dormer is one of Al Pacino's more memorable roles, ranking up there with the characters Frank Serpico, Michael Corleone, Tony Montana, and Vincent Hanna.This was a movie that I could not rate right after seeing it.

Too loaded with talent to be sleep-inducing,"Al Pacino as a veteran homicide detective, Robin Williams as a killer, Christopher Nolan of ""Memento"" behind the camera -- everything's in favor of ""Insomnia,"" a remake of a Norwegian film from 1997. Strangely, the fact that the story doesn't have clever twists and doesn't play out as a noir mystery like it starts out as is the only thing between ""Insomnia"" and greatness.Will Dormer is easily the last good character Pacino has played. He's tired, harboring a multitude of dark secrets and he's good at his job. He's on his way from Los Angeles to Alaska with his partner Hap (Martin Donovan) to investigate the murder of a teenage girl. When they spring a trap on the killer, some thick fog and a mix-up results in Dormer accidentally shooting and killing Hap. Knowing this would be the end of him, Dormer claims it was the killer who shot Hap. The guilt in combination with 24-hour sunlight that far north leads to a number of sleepless nights. Then it really gets intense when the killer (Williams) contacts Dormer and threatens to expose his secret.The dynamic between a criminal and a cop who don't want to work together but must if either is to come out of this mess unscathed is what makes ""Insomnia"" unique. Pacino and Williams come from two totally different acting backgrounds, so their chemistry keeps the tension for much of the film, which is key when the ""whodunit"" interest factor gets thrown out the window rather quickly. The story becomes much more of a drama and the suspense comes from whether they can dupe the local police, especially the naive and tenacious young cop Ellie (Hilary Swank) who idolizes Dormer and his work.The sleep deprivation factor acts as Nolan's creativity license. The story sticks entirely with Frank's point of view, so a number of tactics are employed to create that sleepiness feeling without going so overboard as to drive the viewer crazy -- or to sleep. Objects go in and out of focus and there's obviously a huge lighting factor for cinematographer Wally Pfister to handle. Pacino's performance, however, ties it all together in this way. It would have been nice if the insomnia was less metaphoric and more relevant to the plot, but there's no use trying to turn the film into something it's not. As much as we want murder mystery or something more akin to Nolan's ""Memento,"" ""Insomnia"" is not that kind of film.Despite no wicked left turns in the story, at times ""Insomnia"" is a bit tough to follow. A lot of what's motivating Dormer happened off camera before the time of the story, so some of that crucial information gets squeezed out. The tension and the acting really sell the rest of the film, so these end up minor deficiencies. ""Insomnia"" is one of those rare instances where the talent and the production values really elevate a film that might not otherwise warrant the any serious acclaim.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

With Nolan and Pacino you can't go wrong,"I went to see this movie for two reasons: Al Pacino and Christopher Nolan. Let's just say I'll bet on every movie either of these two participate in, and this is no exception.Without spoiling too much, Al Pacino's character is having trouble sleeping all through the movie, for more than one reason. His behaviour gets more and more confused and unfocused as the sleep deprevation takes effect. Pacino's acting in this movie, directed superbly by Nolan, is his best ever, in my opinion, which is a good enough reason to go see this movie.The photography in this movie seems to focus on extreme long shots of the Alaskan landscape and on close ups of the characters, to show that there is little in between in that environment. The editing, however, plays a much larger role in telling the story, specifically sharing the main character's state of mind with the viewer to complement the intense acting. Therefore, as the tagline says, try not to even blink throughout this movie.If anyone is expecting another masterpiece like Memento, this isn't it. But still, for Pacino's acting and Nolan's marvelous direction, I give it 8/10.Enjoy! =8-)",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

He must have been duct-taped,"Going from Memento to this one can only wonder if Christopher Nolan did in fact have anything to do with this film.  The girl I went with fell asleep several times (which brought new meaning to the film's title). I almost fell asleep twice.  The acting is very good, it's just the damn movie moves along so slow.  It's like 'Ok, we got your point, it takes her a while to drive out to the cabin'.... 'do you have to draw it out into a 10 min scene?'. Keep in mind to all you Nolan fans.  He remade this movie from a movie that came out several years ago in france.  So he took a bad egg to begin with. He still shoulda known better. Tisk tisk.  Hopefully he just caught a momentary case of McTiernan virus (McTiernan went from DieHard to Rollerball 2002) and he'll recover.Let's all send our best wishes to Nolan on a speedy recovery.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What a crime/thriller genre should be.,"First, the build-up of the story and narration of it are exciting and organized at the same time. How did Nolan do it? That combination is hard to achieve, but when it succeeds, the level of the viewers' focus is extremely high. EDITING. Most of the time, the editing part of films is considered supplementary. When it is lousy, it shows; when it is done well, it's not noticeable, rather smooth.

Gotta love this one,"Insomnia isn't your average serial-killer story. It's better.There are several elements in this movie that makes it work:First of all, the storyline. It's intriguing; it deals with guilt, lies and the desire for (impossible) redemption. The plot doesn't center in finding who the killer is or who is gonna be his next victim, that is pretty much clear when you see the trailer. No, the plot revolves around the cop having his prey in his hands but not being able to turn him in or finish him off.The performances. The oscar-winning trio make the best out of the script. Pacino, Williams and Swank are perfectly cast and give the best performances I've seen this year. Al Pacino and Robin Williams prove that they can do a role far different than what they're used to. Williams has the potential to do a memorable villain. Let's see what he's up to in the years to come.Directing and cinematography. Boy, Christopher Nolan achieves to picture a place where you actually can't sleep. This little town is a dark, creepy place although the sun never sets. Also, through out the movie Nolan depicts quite well that awful feeling you get when you haven't had any sleep.I loved this movie. Please, don't think of it as a ""Seven"" or ""The bone collector"" type of film. It's smarter than that. I tell you this because on my way out of the theater I heard a couple saying ""Ah, I thought it had more action, I almost fell asleep..."". Oh please! You want to see cheap entertainment?

A Good Film- no doubt- but not without its slower moments,"A taut, sleek, and well acted thriller- Insomnia is a more than decent remake that makes the best out of its cast and source material, to make for a slow, but ultimately very interesting thriller. As always, I praise Nolan for his direction in this film. There is no one I feel would be more fit for directing it. The writing in the film seems to drag a bit at parts, with its pacing even slowing to a crawl, but I still find myself enough invested into the story and characters to keep going- and i'm glad I did. Al Pacino gives a fantastic performance in the lead role in this film, and i'm very glad it was him in the role, rather than previous casting choice Harrison Ford, as I feel his performance in The Fugitive would undermine the whole film a bit. Hilary Swank is also very good in her performance, but the true game changer in this film is Williams, who isn't afraid to try something drastically different from his usual roles- and surprisingly succeeds so very well at it. I did feel the film could have been about 15-20 minutes shorter, but luckily it kept me engaged just enough to enjoy it, which is good, considering all the great talent this film provides and is involved with. In the end, Insomnia is not Nolan's best by far, but a good remake and a good film- nothing more, nothing less- and sometimes that's all you really need.

Compelling,"This finely wrought remake of the Norwegian film of the same name (1997)--an excellent film by the way--is something close to a thriller masterpiece flawed only by a too-hurried resolution. Christopher Nolan, whose strikingly original Memento (2000) is among the best films made in recent years, planned this out very carefully, tying up most of the loose ends without relying on any phony motivation, which we sometimes see in passionate cop dramas. However, the guns blazing at the end was a cheap way out of this psychologically complicated story. Still, I think we can overlook that small fault since the rest of the film is so very well done.The incomparable Al Pacino gives a mesmerizing performance as Los Angeles police detective Will Dormer who is sent with his partner north to Alaska ostensibly to help in a murder investigation. However we quickly learn that being out of town may help him and his partner avoid an Internal Affairs investigation to which Dormer may be vulnerable. By the way, ""dormir"" in French means ""to sleep,"" which is something Dormer does not do for six days, which is very close to the edge of human tolerance. Indeed Dormer's last line in the film is ""Just let me sleep.""Pacino is supported by Robin Williams as Walter Finch, a morally-deranged mystery writer who doesn't appear until the film is about half over. He makes up for keeping us waiting with a dramatic performance that will curl your toes. He is even more despicable than Bjorn Floberg was in the Norwegian film. Not only is Robin Williams's appearance subtly altered and his demeanor strange, even his voice is not the same. He is a long way from Good Morning, Vietnam (1987) and Mrs. Doubtfire (1993), but I think this is, in a more modest way, one of his best performances.Also featured is Hilary Swank, whom you should see in Boys Don't Cry (1999) if you haven't, as Ellie Burr, an ingenue Alaskan detective in awe of the master cop from the big city. Notable in a modest role is Jonathan Jackson as Randy Stetz, a high schooler with a chip on his shoulder. I also liked the brief appearance by Katharine Isabelle, who played the murder girl's trampy girlfriend.The key psychological question in both films is why does Will Dormer decide to cover up the accidental shooting? In director Erik Skjoldbjaerg's 1997 film the answer is human nature. That certainly worked, but was not enough for Nolan, and so he gives us Dormer's Internal Affairs problems back in L.A. as further motivation. This works very well for two reasons: One, it is convincing. Recall his spontaneous confession to the hotel clerk (Maura Tierney). And two, the cop problems in Los Angeles are right out of the headlines of recent years. They are real. Nolan even has Ellie find a copy of the Los Angeles Times with one of the stories on the front page.The next psychological question is, is the villain a serial killer in the making? If he is, then Dormer must stop him regardless of his own problems. And therein lies the internal conflict of the film so well projected by Al Pacino. We know that there is something more than the midnight sun to account for Dormer's disintegration. He is a flawed cop. Like some of his real life counterparts in L.A. and elsewhere he took it upon himself, by falsifying evidence, to administer justice to a man he knew was guilty. When he did that, he knew (and this is something he teaches Ellie) that he had lost his integrity as a cop. The temptation to frame somebody we know is guilty of a horrendous crime is very great and many of us would fall into it.Since I cannot discuss the ending here in any concrete way, let me just say that if Nolan had really taken his time with the ending he might have had Dormer simply murder the villain and face the consequences (or even commit suicide). But I suspect Nolan believed that the heroic character of his star would have been compromised. In Skjoldbjaerg's film the police detective actually shoots the dog to obtain the spent bullet he needs. In Nolan's film the dog is already dead. I think this minor blush of character actually taints Nolan's film to some small degree and leads Nolan down the path to the Hollywood ending to come. But judge for yourselfOne final point. A lot can be gotten out of a single camera shot. This is something that Nolan does very well. A case in point is the shot on the plastic evidence bag holding the bullet that Dormer picks up in the lab. Nolan has the camera show us the words on the bag, ""chain of custody,"" and he has the camera linger long enough for us to read them. This nice touch reminds us that THAT very chain of custody is being compromised, another echo of real life criminal investigations from recent years in L.A.See this for Al Pacino, at his best here, one of the great stars of our era whose ability to command the screen is second to none.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

Very Suspending!,"InsomniaRated R for Language and ViolenceStarring: Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary SwankStar Rating: ***** out of 5Genre: Drama/Crime/ThrillerThe movie is about a Los Angeles Detective Dormer (Pacino) who goes to Alaska to solve a very unspeakable crime with a local detective (Swank) and they are trying to solve a case of a murder of a teen who was murdered. I couldn't believe that Robin Williams plays the bad guy in this movie! When one of the detective's accidentally shoots his partner he takes the blame but yet continues with the case. When Walter Finch (Williams) keeps playing mind games with him the game keeps getting even deadly and Detective Dormer keeps having all this head that he keeps having insomnia.BOTTOM LINE: VERY GOOD!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
excellent character study,"Insomnia doesn't resemble other action thrillers in the way that it is  rather a character study revealing the conflicts of an experienced cop who happens to make a fatal mistake while on duty. Al Pacino is amazing and very natural.So is Robin Williams,even though it is the first time I have seen him playing the evil character. Hilary Swank is also very successful in a supporting role. The daylight and the insomnia concept which is being emphasized all throughout the movie isn't of course the mere lack of sleep itself, but it is a symbol used to show the type of conflict that Pacino's conscience is going through. The end and the universal message it puts forward is very dramatic and touching and one which I won't be able to forget for a long time. Highly recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Where its always light, there is darkness","Excellent telling of a fairly uncomplicated story, none of which I will re-tell here.  Partly because I still have questions about it all and partly because I am not sure what I saw, but I mean that in the best way possible.All three stars deliver the goods, but Pacino is in his zone and for my money, hasn't been this good in over a decade.  Robin Williams is also excellent in a role he was probably not offered immediately, but he handles it all very well.  Its not that his acting ability was ever in question, but when you play the bad guy, there are a couple of ways you can do it, and a lot of them are bad.  Hilary Swank is just a talented actress who can do a lot more than parts like this, but she was excellent as well. I could see why all three wanted to be involved in this project.Out of the supporting cast, I enjoyed Nicky Katt (he tells a very funny joke toward the end), Maura Tierney and Martin Donovan. Paul Dooley is there in the beginning and then not so much at the end.Jonathan Jackson, who I enjoyed in 'The Deep End of the Ocean', basically has one scene, but he makes it count.The movie is edited to the skies but that's also a good thing.  Its especially effective near the end, when you want Pacino to sleep so bad that somewhere I bet people are throwing valium, blankets and Teddy Bears at the screen.  You feel exactly like he does, or when you feel when you're just about to fall asleep, but wake up suddenly, with a shudder.  That the editing can communicate that is worth mentioning.Beautiful cinematography and worth seeing on a big screen for the scenery. Top work by all involved.  8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Slow but good.,"Insomnia is a movie that puts very heavy importance on pacing. It builds and builds, very slowly, but methodically and intelligently. It's a deep movie that needs an avid watcher. If you are short on attention or feel like watching something that will come out and grab you, I don't reccomend Insomnia. I think you really have to want to watch this film for it to suck you in.Sometimes this movie just got a little too thick and slow for it's own good. I realized towards the end, when the one cop tells a vulgar joke, that that scene is probably the only light hearted moment of the entire movie. And even then it's weighed down by Swank's character, who has a lot on her mind at the time. Certainly this is a very serious, heavy movie, and it should be, but a little break to clear the viewer's mind now and then would have done wonders.Great acting all around, good directing and good script make this movie a 8 out of 10. It also gets kudos for being up there with Fight Club as the best portrayals of having insomnia in a film. (Insomnia shows the condition pretty dead on, and is less obvious about it than Fight Club)",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Great insightful drama,"This is a very well acted drama. If you like Al Pacino or Robin Williams, you will enjoy this movie. This is the kind of movie that unfolds before the viewer. To mention any material aspect of the movie in the review will spoil the movie for the viewer. This is a classic crime drama with imperfect people on both sides of the law. Acting is top notch and very believable. The movie takes place in Alaska, during the Summer where Alaska earns the nickname Land of the Midnight Sun.

You have a great cast (Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and Hiliary Swank), a great director (Christopher Nolan), a great screenplay, and just great over all.Don't have to worry about this one. You can relax instead of trying to figure it out, like Memento. It's a cat and mouse movie. It moves back and fourth from the good guy to bad guy. You already know who the killer is, and all the director does is bring you along for the ride.Each scene of the movie, was memorizing. Plus, it had a great scenery. The setting is in Alaska.

Very European,"I find European films can be either extremely well done, or done on a low budget; where a quality story is replaced with shock value.(ie nudity and bizarre events)  Much, like today's real life TV where shock replaces a high budget for ratings. I never seen the Swedish version,(it may be Norway, or Finland) of this film, and it must be excellent.  I figure if a producer will spend big money on a remake it will be good like Unfaithful.  The European film story is usually more complex than North American style.  I like this film's story, where the cop gets caught in a pickle, and can not incriminate himself.  This is a story of strings, where bad choices can pull other strings and create other problem.  The killer tries to make himself be like the cop, but he gives clues that this is an untruth.  In the end, another cop is given the same choice, and that leaves an impression on the viewer.  Like Unfaithful one see the ramification of there actions. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Hooh-Ahhh!  Good Stuff!,"In the American version of a 1997 Norwegian film, Al Pacino is Will Dormer, a decorated veteran LAPD detective.  He and his partner, Hap Eckhart, are ostensibly in Alaska to help an old friend of Will's investigate the murder of a seventeen year old girl.  Hap, however, is convinced that they have been sent away to ease the pressure of a sweeping Internal Affairs investigation underway in L.A.Dormer closes in quickly on the primary suspect, mystery novelist Walter Finch (Williams).  Fortunately for Finch, however, he has some valuable leverage on Dormer; he knows something that Dormer can't afford for anyone else to find out.  As a result, Finch, who believes that his experience as a writer qualifies him to be a master criminal, is able to manipulate Dormer and the local cops.Compounding Will's problem with Finch is the midnight sun of Alaska; Dormer hasn't been able to sleep since he arrived.  As Dormer's grip on reality becomes increasingly tenuous, he is beset on all sides by his personal demons, by the devious Finch and by an earnest rookie police officer, Ellie Burr (Swank), concerned about the direction her own investigation is taking.Christopher Nolan's first directorial effort since his critically acclaimed Memento is significantly less confusing and much more rewarding.  The Oscar-encrusted cast deserves quite a bit of the credit.  Pacino is Pacino, but he works perfectly as the shady, shoddy veteran cop and he manages not to chew up all the scenery.  Robin Williams is surprisingly creepy as Finch, and he manages not to erupt into madcap hysterics.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Insomnia? I couldn't keep my eyes open!,The scenery was great. The idea of it never getting dark was weird. But that was about it. I think they must have sacked the make-up artist early in the proceedings as dear old Al never even started to look tired. He may have been hallucinating but where were the bags under the eyes? And the plot was so predictable I could have left after half an hour and still known what happened at the end. Robin Williams was pretty credible as a bad guy though. Can't believe this was made by the same guy as Memento. No comparison. Waste of two hours.,3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Complex, thoughtful crime drama set in the land of the midnight sun","Set in Alaska, this film makes good use of the delirium caused by the midnight sun, using it in a ""Telltale Heart""-esque context.  The cast is outstanding, with Al Pacino as the cast's pater familia, Hillary Swank as an eager rookie cop, Robin Williams turning in a disconcertingly creepy performance as a bad guy, and interesting supporting players including Maura Tierney and Jonathan Jackson (be on the look out for good things from this up-and-coming young actor).  I recommend seeing it on the DVD. Christopher Nolan, Insomnia's director and the imagination behind Memento, twists time in the commentary track.  The film is presented in the order shot, rather than in the order of the script or finished film.  This is an approach I wouldn't mind seeing in more commentaries.  Very thought provoking!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The Best Film of the Year...so far,"It is so nice to see a great film slip through Hollywood untouched by the typical big explosions and horrible screenwriting that has been and continues to be the craze in the industry.  Christopher Nolan has quickly and clearly established himself as a great filmmaker with another great story and an even better film.  The film is remarkable for its storytelling and characters, and not to mention its independent flair, which is rare and admirable these days.  Pacino, Williams, and Swank deliver the goods in this fresh and dramatic thriller.  Did I mention the acting was absolutely wonderful?  Well it was.  Did I mention that the directing was top-notch? Well it was.  Someone once said this would be a good David Fincher film, they couldn't have been more wrong...Nolan's style is far more developed (latent imagery with a certain degree of ambiguity) and does not rely on the MTV style camera and editing effects to make his stories mysterious and intriguing, his blatant manipulations of the audience's knowledge and perspective is far more effective.  I recommend this film to anyone in the mood for a mindbending, deep journey into the human psyche.  This is what great filmmaking is all about.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Even Better Than The Original,"Well-written, superbly acted, beautifully photographed, Christopher Nolan's Insomnia is definitely the best release of 2002 so far!  And for those of you who are afraid to watch because you've seen the original, I promise you will not be disappointed.The screenwriter made appropriate changes to the script that really improved the film.  The dialogue could have been simplistic, but instead was natural and sophisticated.  Most invited were the addition of several unpredictable plot twists as well as an improved ending.Pacino, Williams, and Swank all deliver incredible performances.  Pacino especially, who portrays the conflicted detective so perfectly.  The cinematography only enhances the emotion of the performance by allowing you inside his head, which compliments the nature of the film.Not only a crime mystery, but a psychologically-charged drama, this film is a must see.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
As Strong As The Norwegian Original,"Insomnia is a slow, gloomy, glum, dark (inside) movie, but this is the way Nolan intended it to be. The slow pace and sudden outbursts of violence and anger make a fine balance for the well-known story of a small town murder. The stellar ensemble of Al Pacino, Hilary Swank and Robin Williams make this strong film a mere feast for eyes, and the breathtaking nature serves as a cold, but magnificent background for the wild human passions that are on display here. Alaskan views are almost a main character of the movie, adding with their cold detachment to the merciless out weaving of the events. It is incredible to see how people live and work in this ever-sunny polar day spell of time, which makes it terribly hard for Pacino's character to get by. He is suffering and we feel it. This is a cool example of Al's excellent acting and he makes it very naturally and very smoothly. All the main and secondary parts are performed well and the whole film deserves a big cheer, with only one possible minus - it was bit too long.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

There were a few good acting moments.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not typical Nolan, but it's worth it","Every viewer probably knows: if in a film somebody has problems with sleep, it is often a sign of a bad conscience. And if the viewer likes something more than a competent detective, it is a competent detective with a bad conscience. Because almost nobody wants to see shrewd men who easily untangle every mystery and have no psychological issues. Definitely not the worst role of Al Pacino.The only problem with this film is that a viewer is by now too used to convolute, multi-layered detective stories with sudden plot twists every five minutes. Not to mention that of Nolan one mostly wishes something totally mind-blowing. But Insomnia is not that kind of a story. There is even not too much of a mystery who the murderer is. In the focus of this story are rather the relationships of the main hero with other characters. With his new temporary colleague who adores him because of his past achievements. With teenagers who despise him as an old man. And then, it is also an intense psychological duel with the murderer. It may seem rather basic but somehow looks very fresh and meaningful. Nowadays, the murderers are often even romanticized, and it is a dangerous trend. To the contrary, Al Pacino's hero is able to show that the villain is not special although he considers himself that way, and it is an extremely important message.Yes, the story is minimalistic, and probably all elements of it are recognizable and lacking too much originality. Still, there are many points worth considering: a protagonist and a villain, both strong-willed and played by brilliant actors, an atmosphere of slowly building suspense and a perfect scenery for a criminal story - the cold, snowy, overwhelming expanses of Alaska.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A real thriller that owes as much to location as to story,"The opening of this movie is typically filmic bordering on cliched, with a panning shot over Alaskan scenery of the two LA cops in a small sea-plane. However, this should not cloud your judgement on what is otherwise an excellent concoction of blinding imageary and genuine suspense.Al Pacino takes to his character like a duck to water. During the scenes in which he is desperately trying to sleep you really do feel his sense of frustration, despair and fear; also helped by the way the camera is overexposed to the bright light penetrating through every crevice. However it is Williams who really steals the film with one of his best performances ever.One of the most extraordinary things about this films is the way Williams mananges to play a clearly very evil and distorted psycopath, yet manages the get sympathy from the audince. This isn't just the typical ""lovable rogue"" Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid style performance; it is much deeper and unfathomable than even the empathy one feels for Hannibal Lector.Overall this movie is an excellent thriller that owes as much to its beautiful scenery and terrific filmic devices than it does to its script and acting. Its only slightly let down by its rather dissapointingly cliched ending. A deserved 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

the anti-summer movie,"""Insomnia"" is not the kind of movie you expect to see this time of year. It's the kind of dark film studios usually save for fall release. The logic is that a) audiences are expecting more serious, dark material that time of year and b) it's positioned better for Oscar attention. Something has happened this summer, though. We seem to be getting back to the idea that summer is not just the time for dumbed-down action. It's the height of the movie box office season, period. If a movie is good, it has the best chance of being seen during this season. That has not been the way things have gone in recent years. The high-profile release of ""Insomnia"" release may be a sign that major movie studios have finally wised up.This summer, if schedules hold, we'll get Cold War thrillers ""Sum of All Fears"" and ""K-19: The Widowmaker."" We'll get the first major studio, serious crime film in a while, ""Road to Perdition.""  Are the days finally gone that true movie fans must spend spring and summer waiting for anything good to watch, settling for what amounts to garbage? I'm hopeful.By the way, I loved ""Insomnia."" It's the best film of the year so far. The film is a rare instance of a project living up to and far exceeding its potential. Sometimes the collaboration of great talent actually creates something great.Director Christopher Nolan, who only four years ago released his first film, ""Following"" on a shoestring budget shot with friends over a year of weekends. Only one print was made of the film at the time. Not knowing this, I was lucky enough to see it screened back in 1998 at a theater in Santa Monica. Only two other people were in the theater. The night before I saw it, Nolan held a Q & A session after the screening. I'm kicking myself now for not attending that. If only I'd had any idea what would happen next. In 2000, at the Toronto Film Festival, came ""Memento,"" and everything changed. A couple of struggling producers named Clooney and Soderbergh immediately recognized Nolan as having big-time potential and tapped him to direct ""Insomnia,"" their remake of the 1997 Norwegian thriller of the same name.I saw ""Insomnia"" on Memorial Day Sunday. The theater was packed.So now here is Nolan, having directed three Academy Award winners in a thriller that found itself taking advantage of a Memorial Day weekend left wide open by schedule shifts. The choice to release it at such a time would not have been made had this film not been so good. I believe that the studio took a look at it and said, 'this is great, people are going to love this. Now, when can we open?'Despite its big stars and probably big budget, ""Insomnia"" is remarkably tight. There's a subdued, perfectly channelled intensity throughout. Stylistically it's only a few clicks removed from `Memento.'  The two films look a lot alike.Each of the great actors, Pacino, Williams, and Swank accept themselves as pieces of Nolan's puzzle, snapping themselves in perfectly. They're the kinds of roles actors live for.Grade: A",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Nothing to hate here.Both Pacino and Williams are beautifully and eloquently restrained... these are great performances.This movie achieves almost greatness through every little nuance in every little detail.Watch it, of course, it's Christopher Nolan showing he can do more than direct an incredibly complex backward-timelined indie flick and succeed majestically.

Stain on the original,While we all love Christopher Nolan for his iconic films this effort and his choice of actors and script in this Remake of the vastly superior original Norwegian movie is lacking and removing the gritty and yes toxic behavior of the leads in the original is missing as well.

They can count on three more nominations early next year from the Academy. Al Pacino is superlative as a detective arriving from Los Angeles to help a murder investigation in a desolate town of Alaska. Pacino's character has many hidden secrets, which would account for his haggard appearance, which worsens after a ghastly accident. Robin Williams is exceptional as a suspect, wisely underplaying the loner role, instead of resorting to over-the-top cliches. And Hillary Swank is ideal as a rookie detective. The Alaskan scenery is a character within itself, alternately beautiful and unsettling. A chase scene over floating logs will leave you breathless; supporting cast is excellent. While the ending may be a bit ""Hollywood-ish"", it hardly detracts from this mesmerizing, thought-provoking near-classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the better thrillers of the last couple of years.,"Somehow I have the feeling that his movie is an underrated one. It's a not much talked about movie, that certainly deserves to be talked about. It has got a great compelling story and it is professionally directed by Christopher Nolan and acted by the fine cast.The movie starts of as a rather basic thriller but as the movie progresses it takes some nice turns. The story remains compelling throughout its entire running time for several reasons; the cast, the settings and the nice twists in the story.The movie its story is very well constructed. It works well as a murder-mystery/detective movie but luckily the story is so much more than this, thanks to some original twists in the story. The movie really starts to get good and interesting from the moment when the detective and the perpetrator are somehow forced to help each other to conceal both their crimes and form an unholy alliance but without ever fully thrusting each other. It makes the movie mostly unpredictable and provides the movie with some nice twists and tense moments.With Al Pacino in the lead, you just can't go wrong. He plays his character with eye for detail and in a sympathizing and honest way. He plays his part interesting, as well as realistic. This way we can always feel and cheer for the main character, even though some of his actions are far from being morally the right. Plus he looks like a very convincing insomniac as well. Also really excellent was Robin Williams in the role of the murderer. In ""One Hour Photo"" he already showed how well he can handle a non-comedy role but his role in this movie is perhaps even better, since the character itself is probably a more realistic every day person. Other fine actors such as Hilary Swank and Maura Tierney are also present but their roles aren't very challenging. Three Oscar winning actors together in one movie!The settings also work really well for the movie. At first sight, Alaska would seem like an unlikely cold and boring place to set a movie in. The nature however looks beautiful and certainly as well adds to the movie its atmosphere. Of course also the beautiful cinematography and subtle directing adds to this.From start to finish a great compelling thriller from talented director Christopher Nolan, with some superb acting in it.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

In short, Nolan creates a killer noir thriller with Pacino working his craft to perfection.  The supporting cast is great too, and hallmarks of Nolan's cinematography and suspense show up much like it did in Memento, his amazing masterpiece from last year.

This big issue makes movie lack its grip of suspense or mystery of murder.

In a city in which there is no darkness, Pacino finds himself having difficulty sleeping; this difficulty is deepened by the guilt that he holds for killing his own partner early on in the film.  A nice twist is entwined in the story when we are informed of a possible motive for murder that Pacino's character had. Thus, Pacino, unable to figure out if the shooting was in fact an accident or not, finds himself entirely incapable of sleep.In another twist of fate, the girl's killer turns out to have seen Pacino killing his partner, thus putting him into a stalemate; Actually fess up to the murder, or let the killer of the girl walk free?The film was very good, with a great plot, good script and wonderful acting on all parts, namely the two title characters, Pacino and Robin Williams.I gave the film an 8.

Suspense thriller delivers.,"Al Pacino plays Will Dormer, a Los Angeles detective sent to Alaska to investigate a local murder.  He and his partner are under investigation by Internal Affairs and their captain decides they need to get out of town for awhile.  Christopher Nolan (""Memento"") directs this remake of a 1997 Norwegian film of the same name.  The title refers to the fact that they're so far north that there's 24 hours of sunlight in the summer and it's hard for newcomers to sleep.Pacino plays a familiar role, that of a world-weary cop (see ""Heat""), but he's so good at it I didn't mind.  During the course of trailing the killer, he accidentally shoots his partner who came up from LA with him.  The situation is complicated by the fact that his partner was about to testify against him for planting evidence on a murder suspect.  Dormer can't tell the truth because no one will believe him so he lies, and the lies lead to more lies and more bad police work.Other actors who turn in good performances are Robin Williams as the wacked out killer.  I never would have guessed it ten years ago, but he's turned into a pretty good character actor when it comes to creepy parts.  Hillary Swank stands out as the local police officer who idolizes Dormer - she studied his casework while in the academy.  She's young and idealistic, everything Dormer used to be, and it's interesting to see the interplay between the two as Dormer tries to hide what he knows she's going to find out eventually.The cinematography is excellent - Wally Pfister returns from ""Memento."" The Alaska scenery is overpowering, perhaps suggesting the smallness of the people who live there.  The constant daylight interspersed with dreary rain and fog accentuate the state of mind Pacino's character is going through, the mental deterioration from lack of sleep and the stress of having to hide the facts about his partner's death.  There is never any night time, and despite the attraction of the younger female cop, no romantic interest to help him forget.  It's just Pacino getting more and more stressed out.I really enjoyed this film.  The direction and acting were excellent all around.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Movie is GOOD; PACINO IS GREAT,"Al Pacino is clearly now the front runner for Best Actor Award. He is simply marvelous in this film as a tortured detective.In Alaska there was a murder, and two detectives from Los Angeles are sent to assist. (I was never sure why!). The problem is that there has been an Internal Affairs Investigation and the younger member of this team is likely to testify against the Pacino character. So when while chasing the killer that detective is shot (accidentally?) by Pacino we and he are left to wonder about the motivation.Pacino, who previously falsified evidence to convict a known killer (why the IA investigation) now falsifies more evidence to coverup his shooting of the younger detective - the twist is that the killer knows this and begins to blackmail Pacino, who can't sleep either due to the lack of sunsets at the that high a latitude (this is Alaska) or his guilty conscience. We are never sure of which, and neither is he.Pacino is marvelous. Hilary Swank good. Robin Williams is creepy as the killer who it turns out is just as much a tortured ambiguous soul as the Pacino one is. This is not a film with black and white borders regarding morality and right and wrong, although at the climax Pacino makes an attempt to clarify that issue in his own mind.The plot works. The setting in Alaska does a good job in giving the feeling of isolation Pacino feels, and he is simply wonderful.Almost certainly ""Insomnia"" will be regarded as a Film Noir classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Zzzzz,"With all due respect to Al, Hilary and Robin, what happened?  How did it happen that three Oscar-winning actors put together such a ho-hum film? There was no suspense to speak of, and I neither liked nor disliked any of the characters.  Was indifference what they were going for?  The only emotion this movie wrung out of me was an overwhelming, ""Is anyone ACTUALLY this stupid?"" when it came to Pacino's character.  Please.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Another good one for Pacino,"The only letdown to this movie, if it was even that, was that I expected the murderer's role to be more deranged. He winds up that way, but I expected it from the start based on the commercials I had seen. Overall a very intriguing story which makes you not realize you spent 2 hours in the theater.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A very good movie with only one little flaw ...,"On the whole Insomnia is a very well done movie. I enjoyed the story, the way it is told and how it develops. The dialogs are kept short. There are a lot of memorable quotes. The cast is very well chosen. Al Pacino is brilliant in his way as always. I also want to mention the performance of Hilary Swank. She is very convincing in her role. Robin Williams also gives a great performance (though I enjoyed his performance in 'Good Will Hunting' more). There is only one scene in this movie which isn't quite so convincing. It's how Detective Dormer (Al Pacino) obtains that .38 bullet. First, you can't muffle the blast of a .38 gun shot with just a towel. The only result would have been black holes in the towel. Second, a .38 bullet fired from that distance would have gone right through the body of such a small decaying dog. No way to recover that bullet with such a tiny pocket knife. Someone who doesn't know about shooting and firearms might not be bothered by this, but I would prefer that scene to be done differently. A dead deer or elk by the road might have been a better option. Nonetheless it is a very good movie and worth having on DVD, because it is worth watching more than once for all its nice details. My rating is 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
New Twist on the Murder Mystery,This was a great new twist on the murder mystery... it wasn't the best movie I've ever seen... but it was definitely one of the best I've seen in the past few years... this is a must see!10/10,10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Nolan nails it AGAIN,"Christopher Nolan nails it again. In this movie he is again able to put the viewer in the state of mind of Pacino's character though various cinematic devices just as he did his previous movie Memento. The pacing is excellent and Nolan gives the viewer a sense of the locale without having the breathtaking Alaskan scenery distract the viewer from the plot.The characters are REAL people, not stereotypes, that is as much owed to the actors as to Mr. Nolan. It's clear that Christopher Nolan is a COMPLETE film maker something that has been so elusive in Hollywood's recent past. It also does one's heart good to realize that all is not lost in Hollywood today, talented people can still work their way into the industry and then be allowed to make quality films.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
DISAPPOINTING,Expected a really good movie with such a good cast plus the positive reviews but disappointing. Had some clever moments and good acting as expected.,4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Stunning,"There's a lot to be said about an actor that can start a movie as a character and by the end of the film he's playing someone entirely different and the audience never caught the subtle changes. Al Pacino nailed this role.Easily some of Robin Williams best acting as well. That coupled with Christopher Nolan's imagery and soundtrack. I rewatched this move about six time in two weeks. One of Nolan's hidden gems, that is arguably one of his greatest films.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A really distinctive detective story,This is more than an ordinary thriller or detective story which Hollywood produces by the dozens these days. I surely like this kind a bit original thriller that has done something for its plot.Al Pacino is great as meticulous detective Dormer. I think you just got to love his relaxed way of acting. However there is much more in detective Dormers character than meets the eye.Robin Williams also does a great role in this film. I personally think his character is one of the best you ever see in these thrillers. His character is also one you should not judge at first sight.This is really a moving story about human motivation. A look into the human mind and what a human is capable of. In the end you wonder just how you got there.Personally I find the lack of too much violence especially delighting. I think you should not make a thriller (or any other kind of movie) if you got nothing else to offer but violence. There are in this film some rough scenes however so I would not recommend this to the youngest in the family.,10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This is an unbelievable thriller that has fantastic characters and unique circumstances,"Insomnia (2002) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently watched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a detective being investigated by internal affairs. He is sent to Alaska to help an old friend investigate a strange murder of a high school aged young lady. He finds some clues that will help him find the killer; meanwhile, the world is finding clues on why he's being investigated by internal affairs.This picture is directed by Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins) and stars Al Pacino (Heat), Robin Williams (Hook), Hilary Swank (Million Dollar Baby), Martin Donovan (Tenet), Paul Dooley (Popeye) and Yan-Kay Crystal Lowe (Final Destination 3).Everything about this movie is brilliant - the characters, circumstances, cast, settings, storyline, dialogue and soundtrack are all perfect. Seeing Robin Williams and Al Pacino play cat and mouse was wildly entertaining. The characters couldn't be more different which made it work. The daylight being a menacing presence was also clever and well done. The background music also added to the intensity of the light. The dialogue is very clever and helps pace the movie. The twists and turns are very smart, and the ending felt like the only way the situation could conclude.Overall, this is an unbelievable thriller that has fantastic characters and unique circumstances. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It's worth the price of admission,"I have to admit right off the bat, that I expected this movie to be given at least an 8.5/10 - 10/10 with 3 top brand actors (Pacnio, Williams & Swank) and a very good director in Nolan after seeing Memento (which was great).After watching Insomnia though, it's proven a point that I should always listen to. ""Just because there are top name actors or directors or producers, doesn't mean the film is gonna be amazing."" And that's exactly what happened here. BUT, (if I paid) it was worth the price of admission (got free passes).The film is set in Alaska, in a small fishing town where everybody knows everbody. A murder of a 17-year old girl is committed and a top LA detective is called in (Pacino) to solve the murder. But the plot takes in interesting twist and the movie takes off there.The pros of this movie: The script was well written and smart. It's not a ""leave your brain at the door movie."" The cinematography is excellent. The direction is very similar to Memento, with very quick flash backs use while a conversation is happening. The acting was fairly good. Pacino, playing the (we've seen it before) don't give a crap detective/cop. Williams, playing a very well, mind-screwing detective author. Swank, who's role was small, but still made the best of it.The Cons of this movie: Williams has a TON of skill and ability as a non-comedic actor, and he doesn't receive enough screen time in my opinion to really shine. If the roles of Williams and Pacino were switched, maybe things could have been a little more interesting. If not, at least the interaction between Pacino and Williams should have been extended or have been able to meet several more times. Where in this movie they only been 2 or 3 times. If the interaction between them where increased, we could have seen acting ability at it's best.Overall, again it would be worth the price of admission. If you liked Memento or Don't Say A Word, you'll like Insomnia.Final Rating: 7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
PACINO KEEPS QUIET SHOCK,"A solid follow up to the excellent ""Memento"" from Nolan. An absorbing thriller, with a beautiful setting. You know where you're going, but there are enough sub-plots to pad out this tale.Good performances from the dependable Pacino, Swank and Donovan. Williams has been praised for a return to form. However I think he's beyond redemption, and was the weakest link in an otherwise good film..",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
