"Underrated, excellent  movie","Its such a shame that this movie would receive such bad press. The idea of just a man by himself on an island may seem boring and long-winded yet this movie isn't. It touches so many emotions, laughter, sadness, fear, tension. When released it was said to be one long advertisement for FedEx however this movie proves to be so much more than this. With a fantastic soundtrack, great storyline, great acting from Tom Hanks, this movie truly is something fantastic. Maybe a bit of a cliché, other than that the movie appears to be faultless and to find that it didn't make it onto the top 250 saddened me as the movie truly is something to be perhaps even considered a masterpiece.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A Movie That Saved Mylife,"A week ago I completely lost every hope in this world and I set my mind to do it, for some reason and out of nowhere I remembered this movie and I had the desire to rewatch it which is quite strange. I watched this movie like 15 years ago and I barely remember anything from it anyway I started watching the movie in the worst mental state I've ever been. Throughout the movie I settled down a bit felt comfortable, some cries then and there some laughs as well and that monologue at the last quarter of the movie truly saved my life when he said ""I've got to keep breathing because tomorrow the sun will rise. Who knows what the tide could bring?"" What a brilliant movie absolutely wonderful, I hope things get better for anyone in a rough spot, take care all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Outstanding,"I think this is an excellent movie..I've noticed many felt it ""too long, boring, etc..."" which is to be expected in today's ""gimme non-stop action; I haven't been doing anything for 5 minutes, I'm bored"" mentality.  This was a true man vs nature movie that really made me think about what I take for granted and I found myself wondering how I would react in such a situation. Would I talk to a volleyball?  you betcha...anyone who has spent any significant time alone can relate.  Bought the DVD and will watch it for years too come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The most deserving film not in the top 250,"This movie is the most deserving of all movies out there that is not in the IMDb Top 250. In fact, this movie should be in the Top 100. Everything about it works, the cinematography, the locations, the acting, the story and this is Robert Zemeckis' greatest showpiece. Tom Hanks has done some bad roles over the years but this is as brilliant as any Jimmy Stewart performance captured on film. I revisit this film about once a year and find things about it that make it even better with each viewing. The story is so well written in its simplicity, and Helen Hunt and Hanks have an amazing chemistry. It is a love story with action and heartbreak like few films have been able to pull together. I guarantee you will never pass a Wilson volleyball again without a big smile!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A wonderfully silent drama with Hanks and Wilson spiritually sensational,"At the turn of the millennium technology started to get bigger and better. Films were starting to develop in a way that was never predicted, but so did the actors. After watching Robert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump 1994, I thought I had seen a true drama, but that was clearly only the beginning.Tom Hanks (Big, Forrest Gump) stars in his Oscar nominated performance as Chuck Noland, a Fed Ex executive who is stranded on an isolated island after a thunderous plane crash.When doing background research on this film, I was surprised to see that Russell Crowe had beaten Hanks to the Oscar in 2001. As good as Crowe was in Gladiator, I personally thought Hanks made the most sensational performance of his career here. Hanks' character Noland is truly remarkable. From being a comfortable and hard working executive at home with his long time girlfriend Kelly (Helen Hunt), to being an isolated figure in different circumstances. The change in character allows Hanks to express his full acting potential and dive deep within the soul of the character. It is a true battle of human intelligence and human power that Hanks does so well to give and some scenes really got to me, it is such a powerful role and does well to rival his other Oscar wins.The text's semiotics are remarkably significant. Having left the wreckage of the plane with only a few supplies, Noland builds himself around what he can salvage and none is more recognizable, than Wilson. A silent volleyball, which was encoded into Cast Away so Hank's could use dialogue to express his traumatic emotions.The plot is made exciting through various scenes. The plane crash is very dramatic and beautifully directed by Zemeckis and scenes shot on the island, when Hanks is alone and wandering what to do are silent and chilling, justifying the drama genre.The beautiful island is contradicted by the drastic situation, a truly magnificent incentive.The ending too is wonderful as it paves the way for many possibilitiesa spellbinding film",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Amazing performance shines through,"Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away.  Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed (not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead), but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year, it is worth it.The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fed-ex deliverer who has a fiance (Helen Hunt) and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia, but alas, the plane he's on crashes in the water and, dare I say more (well I can because practically everyone saw the all-revealing trailers)?  Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball).  That Hanks can communicate with this volleyball, and almost make the ball as a real person with real feelings that is almost like the Silent Bob to his Jay, is one of the films triumphs.  The others of course being the whole lot of him on the island and Hanks' performance.  If it was someone else, it would not be as successful, but Hanks gives his all and (as usual) pulls through 5 fold delivering one of the years and his best performances.

well-crafted and intriguing,"From director Robert Zemeckis comes this powerful character study of a man and his quest for survival. Hanks is a time-obsessed postal worker on a routine cargo transport. His life is forever changed after the plane crashes and he finds himself stranded all alone on an uncharted island. We're drawn into his long, arduous journey as he struggles not only to keep his sanity, but to stay alive so he can make it back to the love of his life (Hunt). A fascinating, believable, and thought-provoking portrait of a man and his fight to live, with a remarkably ideal performance from Tom Hanks, and steady, effectively leisure direction that allows viewers to accompany this resilient survivor on his emotionally wrenching journey. A small idea expanded into a one of a kind movie. ***½",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Great one-man performance,"It's 1995. Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) is a FedEx systems analyst troubleshooting around the world. He is meticulous about time in his work. He comes home to spend the Christmas holidays with his girlfriend Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt) in Memphis but he's called away. Before he leaves, he gives Kelly a box with a ring and declares ""I'll be right back."" His plane goes off course in the storm and crashes in the Pacific Ocean. He gets marooned on a deserted island with some of the packages washing on shore. His only companion is a volleyball he names Wilson.This is one of the best one-man performance ever. The story itself isn't as compelling as one assumes. It is a lot of wave sounds while Tom Hanks discovers survival techniques through trial and error. Wilson is a fascinating invention. It's interesting that Robert Zemeckis doesn't insert a voice for him. It actually works very well. The movie can drag at certain places but Hanks is always a fascinating watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
What a fantastic film!!!,"I have never seen a more meaningful and thought-provoking film. Right from the start, I knew this was going to be a classic film, and my opinion was not changed throughout the course of the movie one bit. It delivers such a strong message of fear, survival and hope, that leaves your mind devoted to thinking about it for a long while after. It made me think about all my creature comforts, and what is actually necessary in life. Talking to a volleyball has never been more dramatic! I also loved the fact that there was little talking in the film, maybe that was because i was staying in a hotel in France with french TV, but anyway, it sort of made you guess how he was feeling, in a clever way. This is one of my all time favourite films, and I could watch it again and again without getting bored... so go and watch it...NOW!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Loved it,I saw this in the cinema and loved it. Essentially a one-man-band show from Hanks who proves himself up to the challenge with an intense physical performance. Great scenery and the addition of 'Wilson' is the icing on the cake.,7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"The Decline and Fall of ""Cast Away""","""Cast Away"" has a brilliant performance from Tom Hanks, solid direction from Robert Zemeckis, and an intriguing plot from writer William Broyles.  The film quickly grows out of slow beginning to build to the fantastic island sequence, which leaves the audience hungry for the final climax.  Yet ""Cast Away"" squanders all these advantages and crashes in the last act.  Why did a movie with such potential self-destruct?  Some points:1) Turning the film into a two hour FedEx commercial was disgraceful and unnecessary.  The family is eating Christmas dinner, and what do they talk about: FedEx!  Hanks and a friend are flying in a plane, and what do they talk about: FedEx!  Who greets Hanks upon his return to civilization: the president of FedEx!  The story would have been much better served with a fictional shipping company, which would have preserved key aspects of Hanks character but not insulted the intelligence of the audience.  People paid to see a movie, not a FedEx commercial.2) The studio ad campaign, which made a super human effort to give away the ending of the film.  I don't know who was responsible for the second trailer, but I would advise studios not to hire them.3) A poor screenplay from Broyles, who came up with a good idea but lacked the talent too properly execute it.  Top on the list is the failure of Tom Hanks' character to undergo any kind of change or growth: after suffering through a life altering adventure, he emerges as the exact same man as when he started.  He remains optimistic and cheerful, never displaying any anger or bitterness.  You would think that a man who was stranded on an island for four years and lost the love of his life would be at least a little upset or depressed.  And after spending these four years alone, living in the most primitive conditions, he needs no time to adjust to modern civilization, except that he doesn't like sleeping in his bed.  He also feels a need to apologize to everyone he meets for being marooned the island, something akin to apologizing for being hit by a drunk driver.  And the final scene with Helen Hunt looks more like it was written for a romantic comedy; in fact, that argument could be made for the entire final act, which is filled with site gags.4) Casting Helen Hunt.  What a waste of talent.  She receives no billing (justifiably, see this is Tom Hanks' movie from beginning to end) and has a relatively small role.  Better for Hunt to devote her considerable abilities to a worthier project, and for Zemeckis to cast a less well known, up and coming actress that might surprise the audience.""Cast Away"" is a movie in three parts: a decent (but slow moving) opener, a fantastic middle, and a disastrous end.  It's a movie that could have (and should have) been better.  On a scale of 1-10, with 5 being average and 10 being a masterpiece, I am forced to give ""Cast Away"" a 5, making ""Cast Away"" a discount theater or rental movie.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Not a film to cast away...,"Quite the opposite. Admire both Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks, and honestly feel that 'Cast Away' is among the best work of both. It is long and the opposite of feel good, but utterly riveting, thanks to the bold risk-taking and Hanks giving a performance for the ages.'Cast Away' has been criticised by some for having an unsatisfying ending. It is understandable as to why it is polarising, and why it is seen as inconclusive and depressing to some wanting something happy. Count me in as somebody who found the ending incredibly powerful and who cannot fail to tear up. Have been picky about endings recently and the inconclusive nature didn't bother me that much and actually appreciated that it was more downbeat rather than happy, who to me would have felt a little too on the pat side.There are so many great things about 'Cast Away' that help make it quite a superb film. Zemeckis' direction is some of his boldest, there are some courageous risks taken like his use of camera work and done in an ingenious way and not overdone. Even better is Hanks' one for the ages almost one-man show performance, sometimes not saying much but expressing a lot in a nuanced way. He is instrumental in making the island and his resilience in struggling to survive riveting viewing and he does so phenomenally.It is a very well made film too, beautifully and cleverly photographed, atmospherically lit and with a lovingly created island setting. They blend so well with the film's tone and with its boldness. The score avoids from being overwrought, while there is a beautifully constructed script that provokes a lot of thought and wide range of emotions. While deliberately paced, the story is an engrossing one, with a excellently harrowing plane crash and the very telling section on the island that to me didn't drag at all even with events being a little on the slight side. Plus there aren't many times when you feel so much for a volleyball, you do here.While the other characters aren't as well written or as interesting as Hanks', it is not in a way to bring down the film in any way. Helen Hunt makes a moving impression even with limited screen time, her meeting with Hanks one of the film's most powerful moments.In conclusion, a powerful, bold and superbly acted, directed and made film that is moving without the audience being forced or manipulated into feeling so. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Definitely worth a couple viewings.,"I'll be honest, the first time I saw this film, I wasn't too sure if I liked it.  I mean, I certainly enjoyed it, but I just wasn't too sure of how I felt about the film as a whole.  I must say that this film was MUCH better the second time around.  And just got better with each additional viewing. I am a huge Robert Zemeckis fan, so maybe my expectations were slightly skewed at first.  But, all in all, I've watched the film enough times now that I can say ""I love this film!!!""When I really stop and think about it, the film is brilliantly executed. The scenery is absolutely breath taking, the special effects are so well done that you don't even realize that there are special effects present. This seems to be a trademark of Robert Zemeckis (case and point, ""Forrest Gump"").  The acting is very good, although, there's only 2 real sources of acting in this film, Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt.  The rest of the cast was good, but their roles were very minor.  Tom Hanks pulls off another great performance, as usual.  You really can feel all of his emotions while he's stuck on the island.  Also, not many actors have changed their physical appearance like Tom Hanks did for this film, I truly applaud him for his work.  As much as I liked Russell Crow in ""Gladiator"", I firmly believe that Tom Hanks deserved it more (although that would be his third Oscar).  Helen Hunt also pulls off a very nice performance.  There is also a good deal of comedy in the film, and it is done very well.This is one of the few films that I strongly recommend you watch.  There aren't a great many films that I would say this, but this one I would. Although...if you aren't a fan of Tom Hanks, then you might have some trouble with this film because a great deal of the film is him alone on an island.  So, if that is the case, then you are off the hook.  So, I hope you watch the film, and I hope that you enjoy it.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Must see survival film,"A film that would be nothing without a powerhouse actor like Tom Hanks. Let's see, this is a film where a single man gets stranded on a deserted island and most of the film's running time is nothing but him talking with himself. No big emotional speeches, barely no action, no real climax - the movie kind of just ends on a mystery, but in a good way - and very little dialogue compared to other recent movies. And it pulls it off, if only barely in certain parts.Tom Hanks is the saving grace of this film. He is charismatic enough to fill the screen with his presence and is able to convey a lot of themes and emotions without talking, which makes the movie enjoyable to watch. Still, the deserted island part of this film is its weakest. I enjoyed both the beginning and the end a lot more than I did the part where he's just going through the known motions of surviving on a deserted island. Yes, some of that stuff is creative, like the reuse of skates for various tasks, and the ""character"" of Wilson adds a touch of both humour and drama into the scenes. Still, Hanks' character Chuck Noland is an interesting guy and he's opening speech at the beginning of the film easily both sets the character, arouses our interest and gives a lot of room for growth, not all of which gets explored. The island was an important lesson for him, but it was more of a necessary evil, if you ask me.That being said, it's a strong movie. The film makers went the extra mile to give it nice little finishing touches that lift it above its peers and make it film worth watching. Definitely recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Excellent film gave me goosebumps,"Crazy that Tom Hanks didn't win the nominations that year! A captivating stranding of wonderfulness, gloriously directed by Robert Zemeckis!

Cast Away is legendary even many years later.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Man VS. nature,"This is the only movie were you actually get emotional attached to a volleyball!The movie starts of real good. We see Hanks as a guy that is always hasted and always have to beat the clock. When he strands on the Island (after an amazingly shot plane crash) he all of the sudden has all the time of the world and the movie turns into a man VS. nature battle were both challenge each other.The are lot's of scene's were nothing really happens and are really slow but it never gets boring! And that's the power of this film.Hanks once again shows his talent and he definitely is my favorite actor of this moment. Zemeckis directing, Burgess cinematography and some nice special effect and make up also do good to this movie.My only points of critic: The time on the Island is to short, it last only about 1/3 of the movie and I really wanted to see more of Hanks on the Island because those are definitely the best scene's. Another thing, the movie is maybe a bit over dramatized at some moments. But oh well...In a way a must see.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Misunderstood,"I simply loved this film but was shocked by the bad reviews that people gave it. To this I say to them: You seriously misunderstood the meaning of it. Although I won't reveal any real details about the meaning because I think that you should try and understand it yourself. The movie was terrific and simply breathless the whole time.  I felt awestruck about how the life of one man could be so changed after an experience that Hanks went through.  I say that every element of the film was perfect.  And for those of you who hate Wilson, you have to understand about how human he really was to Chuck. I was amazed on how well this movie was made and think that everybody should have an experience that should cause you to take stock of your life.  I was so adamant to get this movie; I got it at 8:00 the day it was released.  I give it an 8/10.  Well done Robert",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"A Tom Hanks vehicle with Hanksisms, Hanky writing, Hanky melodrama","Tom Hanks stars as time-obsessed FedEx executive Chuck Noland who literally lives by the clock, even when spending time with his girlfriend (Helen Hunt) during the holidays. On Christmas Eve his beeper calls him to catch a last-minute FedEx flight to Malasya for official business and he waves ""I'll be right back"" before he boards. Then his plane crashes in the Pacific and Chuck is indefinitely marooned on a desert island, with only a volleyball as his company.I have huge affection for 'desert island' premises and subscribe to the thinking that whatever you do with the execution, it will still be a wonderful experience. It simply cannot go wrong. It does not go wrong in 'Cast Away' either  although I would have loved to see more exploration of the lush island jungle  in fact, its island sequences are all golden. The only problem this film has is the lachrymose final act in which Hanks fades and director Zemeckis pulls up the directing chair and starts pouring in relations-melodrama to sew things together.Everything up until this rote lukewarm point is well-crafted with patient strokes, courtesy of the film's protagonist. Tom Hanks, who put forward the idea for the film to Forrest Gump-pal Zemeckis, is in nearly every scene and carries so much dramatic weight, effortless leading man appeal and sympathy-laden charisma that he sucks you in entirely. Initially I applied some skepticism to judging his businessman character and it was not until the vivid, epileptic plane crash sequence that he started to absorb me. As the airplane was sinking into the deep blue with Chuck trapped inside (I can't imagine anything more frightening), you knew, judging by how much you were pulling for him, that he was our hero. This is man vs. nature at its best.Upon waking up on the beach of the stormy desert island, Chuck is faced with some of the weapons mother nature has in her arsenal: you can feel the energy being slowly drained out of him during the first couple of days as he struggles to crack coconuts, find water, build shelter, make fire, catch fish and tend to his wounds. Insanity sweeps across the shore and Hanks aptly embodies the hard-edged, blood-spilled, sweat-dripping, tear-shedding transformation of a time-driven businessman to a primitive instinct-driven maroon. It is eerily crafted with an harmonic silence and sans your dutiful MacGyveresque inventions, scaffolds or nifty tools. Here is a mere man, seen through epic aerial shots and with underlying subtitles that spell out ""desperation"" and ""loneliness"", both of which Hanks assuredly and crisply exemplifies.So then, what is really wrong with 'Cast Away'? Nothing  aside from marginal missteps  is wrong with the cast away part, it's the ending that that is not in-tune once Zemeckis wields his clear-cut, spelled-out and moralist trademarks. I refuse to spoil anything (mostly because I remember the film having been spoiled to me long before I sat down to watch it), just rest assured you will be begging to be taken back to the exciting island.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Tom Hanks or Daniel Day-Lewis,"They both have their place and there's room for both. These two actors, and I'll throw Sean Penn in there, are touched by God.

"In my opinion, the best movie ever made.","This is the movie that defines perfect. Every way I look at it, it's amazing. Now, if you don't think this movie is perfect, erase all of the thoughts you had about this movie before reading this, or else you'll probably disagree with many of the things I say.This is my favourite film of all time. I love Tom Hanks, I love the location, I love the story, I love the camera-work, I love every aspect. I'll start off with Tom Hanks himself. Well, he sure says a lot without saying much. The emotions on his face are unbelievable realistic. Every breakdown Hank's character has seems real. He can also make the audience emotionally invested in a volleyball, now THAT'S good acting.The camera-work is astounding. There are many shots that last much longer than the average take in a movie. At first they annoyed me, but now I love them. The pans that can take a minute long really add to the realism, and just lets you take in the situation the main character is in. The effects are pretty good too, sometimes the porta-potty sail looks kinda iffy, but for the most part it's solid. Zemeckis nailed it with how this film was put together, and the camera crew did amazing too.The story comes off outlandish, but in the end seems realistic. I found that the chances of Noland actually surviving a plane crash and then stumbling upon an unoccupied island slim to none. But hey, at least it's not like Lost, where not only to they crash onto an island, but like 20 or so people survive. I absolutely adore the ending. It shows that the movie will take risks, and that it's willing to vary from the crowd. Some people might say this movie is depressing, but for me, it's a perfect balance. We see a whole bunch of sad and dramatic stuff, so when the happy, funny moments come around it makes them all the more enjoyable.Finally, I will put all the stupid complaints to rest. A feature length FedEx commercial. Ya, right. Regardless if Zemeckis made a deal with FedEx or not, it makes the movie even more realistic. A real company makes it seem like it really happened or really could happen. Not to mention, why does it bug everyone so much? I didn't even notice how many times the name appears until I read someone complaining about it online. The next thing is the runtime. I'll admit, this movie is a bit long, and is not very convenient. When i saw this for the first time, it bugged me how long the events went on after Chuck is rescued, but now it makes sense to me. More story needed to be told. This wasn't just a survival movie. It's supposed to be more than that. A character study, as we look at the lengths someone will go to stay alive, and the effects that being taken away from civilization for a long time can have on a person and the people around him. And for everything else, you don't like Tom Hanks or the story, that's really just personal preference and I probably won't change your mind on that.Well, I think Cast Away will always be my favourite movie, and for me, It's a dream come true. My favourite director and my favourite actor come together to make a masterpiece. It's Zemeckis' best movie (Forrest Gump is a close second) and Zemeckis has mastered the art of telling a good story. But, can you please stop with all those CGI movies? It was cool at first, but now it's getting old. Oh well, we've still got his early work, one of the best films ever made, and my favourite film of all time.Cast Away 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Remarkable and a story that everyone would want to hear about,"Castaway is one of those classic movies that everyone must see. The plot is uncommon and it was very interesting. Tom Hanks played a great role as Chuck Noland. The fact that he had to face and understand the difference between life in the real world and living in an island with nobody else but a ball named Wilson, made the movie remarkable. Every second is mesmerizing and really made me wonder how scary and difficult it is if I were in Noland's position. This movie also contained love that played a main role to Noland's survival, which makes the audience to feel not as desperate to watch Noland getting lost with the power of love that brought him hope. Also the transition of time as Noland lived his different life being an outcast was really interesting. Not only by appearance, but also mental and behavior. It's a classic the everyone must watch. Tom Hanks played it really well. It also made me question his future fate as the movie goes on, telling about his journey and survival day by day.

South x South-West Pacific,"I just had the unexpectedly strange and very moving experience of seeing CAST AWAY for the first time with a 39 year old male friend who is deeply traumatized because he is estranged from his pretty blonde wife and gorgeous young children. He lives in a coastal holiday resort; palm trees, hibiscus and mountain cliffs. His complete inability to previously express his agonizing emotional solitude whilst living here (in Australia) in paradise had him descend into sobbing heartbreak throughout in a way I have never previously witnessed. He kept exclaiming to the screen (and Hank's emotive performance and situation) ""This is ME, This is how I am feeling"" and for the first time in many years was able to melt, awash with emotional relief at being able to translate his feelings whilst watching the ordeal in play. It was an astonishing paralyzing experience for me to share with him and it has as of today (today!) allowed him to seek the help and professional guidance with a degree of confidence and heartfelt understanding previously unavailable to him. So I had a double feature! A real life human drama in the room with me, and the film itself! It all added to the experience of having someone alongside who was living CAST AWAY for real in his own heart and head. Maybe if you have a distressed friend unable to break into or out of the emotional knot caused by bereaved family loss, this film will allow a way forward. It worked for us.any way.....One has to hand it to Hanks though for a front and center performance that allows every man watching to see his everyman persona on show and apt in every movement and emotion. CAST AWAY is a magnificent looking film, in c/s and on a huge screen it must be astonishing; great plane disaster set pieces and tropical traps, hilarious and heartbreaking Robinson Crusoe level drama and photography and sound design worthy of Oscars. I was queasy about all the FedEx ""ads"" throughout but agreed in the end it was a great device. I especially liked the North By Northwest farm locale seen early and late in the film... and even the positive denouement allowing a realistic life pointer to be an acceptable ending. For a few moments there in the final act, I gripped the seat in apprehension hoping the schmaltz possible wasn't about to really happen. I would watch CAST AWAY again, in fact I want to and will start from the terrifying and spectacular plane crash through the excellent compelling Island sequences and exit with the ocean tanker in the background. CAST AWAY is a uniquely American film success, too long in the last act, and perfectly realized in all the island scenes by the irreplaceable Tom Hanks. I thank you and my pal is today able to move on as well.Other similar theme movies worth seeing are: ""Man Friday"" (1975) with Peter O'Toole as Crusoe and Richard Roundtree as Man Friday, and the excellent LOST style telemovie made by Universal in 1969 called LOST FLIGHT which stars Anne Francis.

The ultimate survivor,"Literally from the moment when humans began traveling the seas and oceans out of the sight of land, there have been tales of people being shipwrecked and marooned. Sometimes it is small groups of people on an uninhabited island, other times there are natives on the island and in a few cases, it is one person all alone. Different and more expanded versions of this story arose in science fiction after interplanetary travel became plausible. The recent hit movie ""The Martian"" is the best-known example of the lone person marooned.
This movie is one where a single person somehow manages to survive a destructive plane crash and wash up on the beach of an uninhabited tropical island. Tom Hanks stars as Chuck Nolan, an engineer with FedEx that is a hard driving, yet somewhat personable individual. He is flying as a passenger in a company cargo jet when they encounter a violent storm and there is an onboard explosion of some kind.
Once on the island, Nolan needs to immediately satisfy his basic needs of food, water and shelter. He struggles to get a fire going, open a coconut and other basic tasks with no modern tools. Fortunately, a few packages from the plane wash up on the beach and he finds some useful items in them. After four years, he realizes that if he does not leave the island, he will die there alone and largely forgotten.
This movie is nearly all Tom Hanks and he does a superb job of playing the increasingly eccentric exile in an odd form of solitary confinement. In order to keep himself sane, he must go a little insane, inventing a semi-imaginary companion to talk to. It is a worthy addition to the story of how humans can adapt in the most strenuous of circumstances and with no hope of any assistance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Life is full of the choices we make...,"Although this movie is one of those ""love it or hate it"" movies, it still proves to be captivating and breathtaking.  First and foremost, Tom Hanks is once again brilliant, and should have won Best Actor.  Second, he and Zemeckis once again pair up for a brilliant director-actor tandem.  I love the way Zemeckis pays attention to particular details (i.e. the ocean, the night sky, like in ""Contact"").  I also think the end of this movie is unbelievable.  I'm kind of gullible and I usually don't get hidden messages, but this one was loud and clear: he reaches a crossroads in his life, and can do whatever he wants.  The two best parts of this movie are the ending and the music, majestically conducted by Alan Silvestri, who typically works with Zemeckis.  The music is beautiful and accentuates the action of the movie.  This may be the ""Tom Hanks Show"" for a good solid 2 hours, but it still conveys a powerful message: people may love, and lose, but they are still free to make independent choices.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
One of the best Tom Hanks films,"Castaway is a perfect Tom Hanks movie where he gets to showcase his skills as an actor. Robert Zemeckis has directed a new take on the Robinson Crusoe saga with a man marooned on an island with nothing more than his perseverance and patience. This may be an adventure film on the surface but there are underlying themes of loneliness, loss and isolation. Of course, there are some stupendous scenes, this being CGI obsessed (in a good way) Zemeckis. The plane crash is a highlight and different from what we have seen in other films and the island scenes with the waves are amazing. As mentioned above Hanks is so good you cannot picture anyone else in his role and his collaboration with the director keeps on flourishing (they also made the critically lauded Forrest Gump). Do not miss Castaway for anything.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A fine effort that falls a bit short due to a couple of poor choices,"""Cast Away"" centres on Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), a FedEx employee stranded on a deserted island after his plane crashes. Entrenched in a desperate struggle for survival, he faces constant physical and emotional hardships. It's a high concept movie that harks back to the classic novel ""Robinson Crusoe"".This was a demanding role for Tom Hanks and he ably carries the picture. The middle portion of the film is basically all Tom Hanks with his only interaction carried on with a volleyball that he transforms into a makeshift companion. Unfortunately, the film's other big name, Helen Hunt, delivers a performance that really makes you wonder how she ever won an Oscar. She and Hanks have absolutely no chemistry together and her poor acting makes the role even more unappealing.The surprising thing about the film is how it turns a simple story of survival into an engaging film. Obviously, life on a deserted island is bound to be somewhat uneventful but Hanks & Zemeckis nevertheless retain our interest. The concluding portion of the film, however, leaves much to be desired and nearly ruins the film. Part of this is due to Hunt's performance but the storyline is hokey to begin with.Director Robert Zemeckis delivers an attractive looking film with a wealth of fine outdoor cinematography. Also worth noting is the sound design, which really enforces the sense of realism on the island. Alan Silvestri's score is wisely dormant during this time, which gives it greater impact when featured at other times. All in all, the entire film is marked by high production values.The film's glaring flaws do not outweigh the more polished elements but it is disappointing to see the film nearly derailed by a couple of poor choices. Nevertheless, the film is certainly worth watching for the good parts.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
one man show that delivers,"Cast Away is a movie that captures the spirit of one character facing the challenges of nature better than any Jack London story. The enormous risk in making this movie was that it relies, more than any other film I have ever seen, completely on the talent of its star, and realistically I don't see how anyone other than Tom Hanks could have made this work. And work it does; Hanks did a lot more than lose 50 pounds to make this a convincing performance - he reached the very core of the transformation from a human surviving in the information age to one that must survive on primal, animal instinct. He is so convincing that when he loses a completely inanimate object (a volleyball - his only companion throughout the mid-section of the movie), he moves the audience almost to tears. There are a few other characters in the movie, and the supporting performances are well done for what they are worth, but this is Hanks's show from start to finish. 8 out of 10 stars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Cure for Insomnia,"'Way too long' is the first thing that comes to mind..If you're going to have a one-person movie, no matter what else you do, don't let that person be annoying, and boy oh boy, does Tom Hanks annoy me!From a logistic point of view, I find it incredible he could live that long. It seems impossible, but then again if he died there wouldn't be much of an ending, and what's shocking about that ... Even when he gets back home, HE'S STILL BORING!  He's just not a fun guy.I felt sorry for the volleyball and was glad when he escaped.  I would have done a lot to get away from Gilligan..sorry, I mean Tom.Seriously, there was good cinematography.  The island probably would have been paradise if the population were more agreeable.Now I can see why Russell Crowe won Best Actor for 'Gladiator'.

DIY:  Survive,"Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), a top Fed-Ex manager, is a workaholic whose life is controlled by the clock. When Chuck accepts a last-minute job that interrupts his Christmas, he parts from his love, Kelly (Helen Hunt), to board a plane which ultimately crashes into the Pacific. Chuck is the only survivor of this crash and is washed onto a deserted island. With only intuition and a few recovered packages, Chuck must learn to survive. His love for Kelly is the only thing which pulls him through this time, but when he is rescued four years later, he returns to civilization only to find that Kelly has moved on. With the love of his life taken away, he must now overcome his most difficult challenge: life without love.In the film ""Cast Away"" (2000) director Robert Zemeckis depicts a great adventure of the hardships and tragedies that one man must face for survival. Zemeckis accomplishes a great feat through this movie. For over half of the 143-minute film, Tom Hanks performs with only a volleyball, ""Wilson,"" and somehow the film never ceases to entertain the audience. Aside from this achievement, Zemeckis successfully portrays his central idea of loss and return and the tragedies that accompany this. His idea is effectively depicted through Chuck's mood changes from desperation to optimism, from passive despair to aggressive hopefulness. In the end, his return is accompanied by the painful realization that he has been gone too long. The central message delivered to the audience is to appreciate life because it can change at any moment.Zemeckis's intentions are also illustrated through sophisticated techniques. The most appealing technique of this film is its ability to attract both genders: females are attracted to Noland's motive for survival, and males are attracted to his techniques for survival. Camera techniques are also very important in this movie's appeal. The camera does not conceal imperfections; it actually strives to capture the unattractive moments to portray true ruggedness. To show Noland's frantic mentality, the camera moves quickly and restlessly. Another compelling technique is Hank's physical transformation. The production of ""Cast Away"" was halted for a year while Tom Hanks dieted to achieve his starved appearance. This along with the other techniques utilized make this film both compelling and entertaining to a wide variety of viewers.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Cast Away shows that we yearn to survive, not for ourselves, but for love.","A classic shipwreck tale that is flipped into a love story. This isn't just about surviving a deserted island with limited resources. No! It's about testing our limitations and capabilities, proving that even the faintest of glimpses of humanity still resides within us when all hope is lost. A FedEx employee travels on a plane, it crashes, he is washed ashore on a remote uncivilised island, he must survive. It sounds formulaic, uninteresting and all too familiar. Yet, the most overlooked director for the past few decades, manages to turn the simplest of plots into something much grander in scale. Time seems to be stationary for Chuck, who is marooned on this island for four years, however the rest of civilisation keeps on ticking. It doesn't hit you until the last thirty minutes where you suddenly become overwhelmed with emotion. You feel for him. You've witnessed him struggle for survival and even contemplate death. Only for the rest of the world to forget about him. It's a sad truth, but a poignant one. Chuck befriends a volleyball with a bloody hand print for a face, symbolising the need for social interaction. But more importantly, so that Chuck can shout ""WILSON!"" which, to me, is extremely satisfying. There is a really profound scene towards the end where Chuck walks around a buffet table looking at prepared crab and a lighter, things that we take for granted. Utterly resonating. So simple yet so powerful. Tom Hanks had a physically transformative role, although at times was slightly bland. Zemeckis' direction is the star. Easily one of his best directorial efforts. Love the camera angles at the beginning where it's conjoined with the FedEx post. I did find that the second act starts to lose steam, especially when we fast forward four years. I feel like some vital and pivotal moments were missed out. I wanted more Helen Hunt, just because I love her. However, Cast Away is another strong entry in Zemeckis' filmography and a decent acting performance from Hanks.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Much Ado About Nothing...,"Before seeing the result of a new cooperation between Hanks and Zemeckis I read lots of reviews and praises about this film. My opinion is: It is the ordinary Hollywood mainstream movie targeted at the average America's audience (by the way, in Europe this movie did not score at all).The first ""let's meet our hero"" part is just terrible. The worst part is about the FedEx guy's visit to Moscow. Hey, Mr. Zemeckis..it is year 2001 now, and you show Russia as it is 20 or 30 years ago. The most ridiculous thing is a lorry stuck in the middle of the Red Square (as far as know, there's no traffic there!) and Tom Hanks ""the savior of under-developed Russians"" paying his employees with bars of Mars and cans of Coke. Hey...this is nominee number 1 for the worst movie of the year!Then we see Helen Hunt with another non-convincing performance this year (I think her popularity this year is a big mistake of the studios' casting). She tries (without success) to show at least some emotions towards her husband played by Hanks. But it seems like Ms. Hunt read her script just before shooting somewhere in between her other numerous movies, because her acting is not convincing at all.Then we are supposed to be stunned by crash-scene, after which the ""one-actor"" show begins. I do not think that Tom Hanks is a bad actor, but his level is not high enough to carry the weight if mega-million dollars' movie alone. For sure, this part of the film contains lots of stereotypes about ""a-la Robinson"" situations. For almost one hour we see how Mr.Hanks learns to make a fire, to open the coconut shells, etc, etc. In fact, Discovery Channel would do this part of the movie in a better way.Then our hero fights with the ocean, loosing his companion, Willson-ball, which was supposed to be a very touching scene. Then our hero is happily home, being saved in the middle of the ocean. His wife is already married, and here it's better to stop the movie, but the director uses the audience's patience for another half-hour, posing some moral questions (finally!) if it is good to ruin new family of his ex-wife.Overall, the movie is boring with exception of some moments (10% of the movie or so). After leaving the theater I just felt like I left an American-style fast-food, feeling lots of food in my stomach but being unable to recall the taste of food. Same here: expensive movie longer than 2 hours with nothing to recall in couple weeks. Indeed, this year was not good for Hollywood.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Cast Away Film Review,"Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) is a man that works for FedEx and travels around the world for the company. During Christmas dinner with his family, he gets a call to catch a plane for work. Something goes wrong with the plane on his way and it crashes into the ocean. The rest of the film shows how he tries to survive on the island he ends up on and him living without the love of his life, Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt).One of the major themes of the movie is survival. Chuck makes the most out of what he has to fend for himself and keep himself alive for the amount of time he is on the island. He makes a bow and arrow type of thing out of sticks to catch fish and crabs to eat, he made a fire with sticks to keep himself warm and to cook his food, and he used the blow up boat from the plane as shelter.The camera crew did an amazing job showing Chuck's will to survive through the camera work. They used aerial shots to show how alone he was, close up shots to show the emotions he felt, and cut to shots during his conversations with Wilson to show that the volleyball was the only ""friend"" he had on the island.Tom Hanks' portrayal of Chuck Noland is one of the best on- screen performances, in my opinion. He did an amazing job showing the desperation Chuck felt while he was alone on this island struggling to survive.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Okay, But Nowhere Near The Hype","I remember all the hype this film got prior to its release. Myself, I was disappointed in it but on a second look with lower expectations it was much better. The DVD picture was outstanding: razor sharp and was much more enjoyable to view than at the theater.I remember a comment or two at church when this film came out, about how it was disappointing that God was never mentioned by Tom Hanks' character in this movie, that anyone in his predicament - stranded on a island for years by himself - would be talking (or even yelling) at God, or praying at one point.Nonethelesss, Hanks and Hollywood are rarely shown needing or asking help from The Almighty, so they show long scenes of him in his Robinson Crusoe mode, talking to a painted volleyball ""friend"" instead.That story, however, of Hanks and his island adventures, is much better than the beginning and endings with Helen Hunt, who almost does the wrong thing but, thankfully, does not. I found that last 20-minute scene uncomfortable but maybe we were supposed to feel that way. I just thought they could have come up with a better conclusion post-rescue.Anyway, most movies in which Hanks stars pretty good, and this is no exception. It's certainly worth a look on DVD.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Too manipulative for it's own good.,"`Cast Away' is a less than average film overall and it certainly is nowhere near as good as it set out to be. There are only two stars in the film that are noticed, Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt.Tom Hanks does fairly well and you can see that he has prepared for the role, but you can also see that he's not very happy with the material he's been given. Helen Hunt doesn't get enough screen-time, given the plot of the film. She is convincing as usual as a loving housewife but only has one scene in the movie in which she `jumps off' the screen.`Cast Away' blatantly shouts out `Give me an Oscar'. The material sets out to be gripping and humane but I found it to be hollow on the inside and some of the scenes were unintentionally hilarious. Come on, one man's friendship with his football?????? At 145 minutes `Castaway' is overlong and surprisingly little is covered in that space of time.The film ends on a question mark and suddenly stops without any satisfying conclusion. Most people, including myself would probably feel cheated out of our money instead of engaged and satisfied. Only the most sentimentally minded audiences wouldn't fall for such blatant manipulation.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Hanks Pulls Off What Not Just Any Actor Could,"I remember being fairly dismissive about ""Cast Away"" upon its initial release before I'd seen it. I wasn't thrilled with the direction Robert Zemeckis had gone as a director (""Forrest Gump"" anyone?) and I was just about Tom Hanks-ed out by the time he made this. But then I saw it, and found myself impressed by both the direction and more notably by Hanks' performance.The difficulty of that performance should not be underestimated. Hanks plays a man stranded on a desert island and spends the vast majority of time alone on screen. Even if there are better actors than Hanks out there, it takes a certain kind of screen presence to pull that off, and Hanks has it. His Academy Award nomination was richly deserved.Grade: A-",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Hanks shines,"For some, cast away will be boring and tedious. For the majority of the film , we watch Hanks as Chuck, fighting the odds to live another day and to one day, hopefully make it back home. It all takes part on a inhabited, isolated island. There not a lot to do except catch fish and smash open coconuts. But the film is not about surviving the harsh surrounding but instead about being mentally strong , fighting self physically problems and living for hope.I can't see anyone else but Tom hanks playing Chuck. He has the likability factor and most importantly he can act. he puts in all his effort for this performance. He has to carry the whole film as he the only living talking thing on that island. He has to pull the audience in, make us care enough to wish and hope that he makes it off the island and thankfully, Hanks didn't let us down. There no over the top obstacles he has to overcome physically. The biggest one is sorting out his infected tooth. Hanks biggest challenge was acting next to a volleyball named Wilson. The scenes in which he speaks to him could of came off as silly but Hanks is so brilliant that he makes us end up caring for Wilson us much as he does.Overall, I suggest everyone to watch this film",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
ANOTHER AMAZING PERFORMANCE BY TOM HANKS.,"7.5 actually.
Tom Hanks offers another amazing performance. (Probably his 2nd best after Forrest Gump) He can carry a full movie on his own by just using body language and emotion. And also the Wilson part is ridiculous. Haha. Well done.
P.s. I love the symbolic ending. Its about destiny and future and having the choice to take your life in any direction of your preference. Nice.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
One-of-a-kind type of film,"I went to see ""Cast Away"" in the theater during Christmas 2000 because I have a taste for stranded-on-deserted-island movies like ""Mysterious Island"" (1961), but was somewhat disappointed. Why? Possibly because of the fact that Tom Hanks' character in the film, Chuck Noland, is stuck on an island all by his lonesome and the island is very small. As such, there's zero social interaction, except with a soccer ball that chuck names Wilson, and there's very little exploration of the island because it's so small. On top of this, the ending is odd and somewhat ambiguous. Despite this, ""Cast Away"" was a surprise hit at the box office.Viewing it a second time, I was braced for its uniqueness and got more out of it, but there's still a lot of downtime or empty stretches as Chuck tries to survive for over four years on the island and then faces a completely new life and perspective in the closing act. So don't expect a lot of action or high adventure; this is a drama about the mundaneness of being stuck on a deserted island and how it positively or negatively affects you. There are only a couple of thrilling scenes, like the excellent plane crash.As noted above, the film respects the intelligence of the viewer by not spelling everything out, but the answers are there for anyone who takes the time to reflect on the events and clues. Some questions the film might provoke: How exactly does a certain Fed-Ex package save Chuck's life? Where's God in all of this? The Texas ranch at the beginning belongs to ""Dick and Bettina"", but at the end to just Bettina, what does this mean? Why the angel symbol of all things? Where does Chuck decide to go at the end?Like I said, ""Cast Away"" is a one-of-a-kind film and so you have to be in the right mode for it. But, when you are, it's very satisfying and even... enlightening.The film runs 143 minutes.GRADE: B-/C+",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Counteracting Loneliness,"So much has been written about the performance of Tom Hanks. He is so convincing that for a while I actually thought this had happened to him. This is a story of loneliness. The Robinson Crusoe aspect is slowly developed as Hanks employs what knowledge he has to do the rudimentary things that are required to survive. Crusoe has Friday; Hanks has Wilson. The despair that develops as one begins to realize that he may die, never seeing another human being or experiencing some tenderness, is so disturbing. When Hanks walks around, arms in the air, announcing to the world that he has made fire, it's a primitive conquest that seems so grand yet so minuscule. The final scene in the film is so gut wrenching. No man is an island but a part of a greater universe. I'm not speaking from a religious foundation but that which is within us.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Makes you think,"This is not film for everyone, let's make this clear. Very slow in some parts, some people would say boring. But the fact is that this film is filled with emotions. Excellent acting by Tom Hanks, he carries the movie by himself. Story about not giving up. Most of us live in a nice environment and take normal every day stuff for granted. But when you see this film, you realize something, life is not about nice car, beautiful clothes and stuff like that, there is more to happiness. We don't appreciate all the things we have in life, ant this film is a reminder to enjoy life and be grateful for all we have. Ending is for some people lousy but for me is one of the best ending scenes ever(you will know what I am talking about when you see it).

"Hanks says a lot with so little, but what is in the box?","I was so upset when I saw commercials for Cast Away. I mean, how much of the movie do you have to let me know about before hand?  I would have enjoyed the movie more if 80% of it wasn't shown to me in the commercials. That being said, Cast Away was a very enjoyable movie. Especially since Tom Hanks is such a brilliant actor. He says so much without saying much at all. He is a very expressive actor who lets his facial expressions and body language tell it all.The movie was actually well paced. I have heard many complaints that this movie was slow and boring. As I have said before (in other reviews), if you can not enjoy anything more thought provoking than the latest N'Synch album or the latest episode of Dawson's Creek than this movie is not for you.I do have one question though? What is in the box? I guess I'll have to scour the DVD for an easter egg with that information. (Hey, maybe I've watched too many episodes of Gilligan's Island. Yeah, that's it...

Good movie. Full of Jungian archetypal images and symbols,"I saw the movie Cast Away and enjoyed it, not only for the fine acting by Tom Hanks (who doesn't need my praise) but for the thorough integration of Jungian psychological symbols throughout the movie.The image of the island is an age-old symbol of alienation where the ego is `cast away' (note that the name of the movie separates the two words usually conjoined when referring to a person, but separated when referring to a physical state or in this case, a psychological state) and meant to engage in a task of self-discovery. Hanks does so throughout the rest of the movie. We see the character played by Hanks at the beginning of the movie, a slave to the clock - an executive of a company - a cog in a system. Who cares if it is Fed Ex as some of the other commentators have mentioned. So what? Would they feel better about the movie if the air courier service was named `No-Name Airlines'?After the plane crashes he makes his way to the island where shortly afterwards he undertakes a symbolic burial of his old self or ego when he finds and buries the crew-member of the airplane. Then he descends into the island cave - an image of his unconscious where he encounters himself. Four years on the island. To any Jungian this is a quaternity symbol. Other Jungian images are apparent: the faint light he sees in the distance to which he tries to swim after on the island a short time - his goal that he is not ready to assume: the waves (his unconscious) push him back. Wilson, the basketball, a symbol of his self with whom he converses by why of psychological projection. The primitive paintings on the wall of the cave in which Hanks sleeps - reminiscent of the ancient wall paintings in France and Spain - all archetypal images of the collective unconscious. The whale which looks at Hanks after his release from the island - a symbol of the dynamic unconscious with which he has reconciled or rather integrated. Finally, the eagle wing symbol on the Fed Ex package - the symbol of the archetypal Self in Jung's psychology, the very place he seeks at the end of the movie and which he finally realizes at the very end while standing at the cross-roads. He has arrived at himself and integrated his life, no matter what direction he goes in, it doesn't matter.There are many other Jungian symbols in this very good movie. Some are very explicit while others are subtle. Think I'm over psychologizing this movie? Ask Semekis the director. I bet he has either undergone Jungian analysis or read an awful lot of Carl Jung himself. Those are my thoughts.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"Slow beginning,  then pretty good","The first 45 minutes of the show establishes the Chuck Noland character played by Tom Hanks as a high-strung Fedex foreman. It could have been done in 5 minutes.

Vastly Overrated,"What is so good about this film that critics and moviegoers alike insist that is deserves not only the praise it's getting, but Oscar nominations? I can only conclude that, sadly, it was such a poor overall year for quality films that we're all so desperate as to rate a below average movie much higher than it deserves.Aside from the fact that the story was nothing more than a dull, overlong, contrived piece that was supposed to be something about 'time', it was just bad filmmaking.  Frankly I think the little P.O.V. shot of the package near the beginning of the movie was one of the most annoying shots that I've seen in a long time.  Just what did that accomplish that a simple closeup of the package wouldn't have.  Follow the package in extreme CU if you must, but please, a package, nor the hand of the delivery man, has eyes for us to see through!  Unless for some reason there was supposed to be a camera strapped to the package.Granted, there is some nice cinematography in the film as well, but it is overshadowed by the sheer lack of any real coherent storyline.  Someone else said it best - Tom Hanks gets stranded and suddenly he's a man without a brain.  FOUR YEARS???  It didn't cross his mind to build a boat before then? I hope I don't get stuck on an island with Chuck Noland, thank you.  Why all the silly gaps in time?  The film would have been much more interesting had we actually seen what he went through in order to survive for that long. (hmmm, think the screenwriter couldn't come up with much for him to do over the course of four years, and if he built a raft right away then the movie would be cut in half... so hey, just put in a long passage of time with a title card and everything is solved?)It pains me to see a film like this getting so much praise.  Yes, it has been a bad year for movies, but there were some good ones too.  High Fidelity, Gladiator... heck, even Mission Impossible II was a better made film than Cast Away.  Here's hoping 2001 is better, so maybe audiences will start expecting a little more from their movies.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Utilizes Multiple Genres And Nails Them All,"In 1985, director Rob Zemeckis created perhaps the most genre-diverse film of all-time with Back To The Future. Fifteen years later, he came close to duplicating that extraordinary feat with Cast Away, an incredibly diverse movie in its own right.For a basic plot summary, Cast Away tells the story of Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), a FedEx worker who goes down over the Pacific in an airplane, washes ashore a deserted island, and must fend for himself in the harsh terrain and conditions.The key to this film is its ability to combine such genres as action, adventure, disaster, comedy, and drama and, most importantly, make them all mesh together and work on the big screen. All the pieces come together nicely to form a moving, exciting, always-moving (I never quite understand why some people consider it ""slow) plot & character development.What really makes this movie a classic, however, is that it is a human interest flick at heart. The mental & physical struggle of Chuck is at center stage here, and the acting from Hanks is impeccable as usual (he can play anything!). It speaks volumes that, within 90 minutes, you may be expressing emotion towards a man's relationship with a volleyball.Overall, I wish more movies would be produced like Cast Away. It has a little something for everyone. Though many film fans consider Forrest Gump to be Hanks' crowning achievement, I personally enjoy this effort tenfold, as here the multiple themes actually converge to form a coherent, dramatic narrative in the end.

No Q&A here,"If you are looking for a life-lesson, this movie stubbornly refuses to teach you anything.It modestly shows what you already know: You will give up almost anything just to live, because you're human and humans are survivalists.It carefully hides what you normally look for in a life-lesson story: what makes life worthwhile? What reward is there for all the pain and toil you may have suffered in the name of survival? That's exactly why this movie could be most uplifting to watch AND AT SAME TIME brutally honest about the human situation.There would always be some book, some authority, some self-appointed life coach along to show you: this is how life works, this is the meaning of life, this is the big answer; and it's almost inevitable you fall for those at some point. What normally happens is you try to live the way they tell you, fulfilling some goals failing most, finally become disappointed in their ""big answer"". Confused and cynical, you move on to the next stage of your life.Yet you still struggle, you still try, for something you know absolutely nothing about, with no logical reasons to ever achieve anything. All the while, life beacons you on with mystery and you cannot help but to walk on.This move is a commentary on life, on humans. Those who thought this movie is ""ambiguous"" are perhaps looking for a life ""Q&A"". I can assure you, you would find no answers here.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
wow,"very very amazing movie great plot great everything now chuck i feel sorry for him i mean his wife leaves him because she thinks he is missing when really he is on an island oh and for those of you who think nothing of Wilson, chuck wouldn't have survived if it wasn't for Wilson, h*ll i wish i had a friend like that who never gripes or complains or doesn't cost money...hahaha oh and he was apart of the cast one of the most important pieces a wonderful movie great script and great characters and Wilson was just the touch!!! a must see movie that depicts what a human really is! this movie in many way makes me feel like that could happen to me someday. and i would handle it the same way as he did just make it through the hard times and yes there were times that chuck probably had fun i mean who wouldn't have fun every now and then oh and you would probably have some real life skills that could save just about anyone anytime and you could be a very self tought person this movie depicts several things wrong with technology and several good things about it....maybe we should all have a little bite of training on how to make rope that was pretty cool how he did it and it was strong to no like some of the stuff we have now days around here and stuff you could by at wal mart just doesn't campare to that",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
An endearing love story,"I have seen this film 5 times. Recently got the Blue Ray version. I am not going to go into the narrative much. Others have done that already. A Mr everybody gets into a situation no one would ever want to endure. Not much dialogue, not a lot of action, but a story of human spirit and survival. Tom Hanks, I praise you as the Jimmy Stewart of our time. C No land.Just wanted to say the ending never leaves me dry eyed. And a line from the film has always got me through difficult times.

one...,"After he tackled (with panache) the fantastic cinema with ""What lies Beneath"" (2000), Robert Zemeckis decided to shot an adventure movie. The result was ""Cast Away"", a simple and bald movie. This film is also the occasion for reunion between Zemeckis and Tom Hanks.After ""Forrest Gump"" (1994), Hanks puts himself in Chuck Noland's shoes who is all the contrary of Forrest Gump. He's a man who lives an unrestrained life a bit all over the world. But one day, his life's tumbling down. Indeed, following a plane crash, he finds himself on a desert island somewhere in the Pacific ocean. Now, he must get organized...Robert Zemeckis' movie is in itself a respectable achievement. It's especially worth for Hanks' awesome performance. He's all alone in front of the camera for a very important part of the movie but he got out very well of this difficulty. Then, dialogs are rare, music is nearly absent but Zemeckis managed in holding the spectator's attention for all the movie. Moreover, he knows what he's doing and in spite of the length of the movie, you don't get bored.""Cast away"" is a movie that even exudes a certain humor. You have to see Tom Hanks's face and behavior in front of his new (and embarrassing) situation on the island.This movie is a little masterstroke and ranks among Zemeckis' best movies.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Good but not inspired ""star movie"". Too much FedEx","Tom Hanks successfully carries this movie, which centers on a single character like few others for a large part of its time. It is an unabashed vehicle for Hanks.Still, I was less impressed with his performance (good, not great) than others on the Net. Helen Hunt is good as always, but finally does not really get a chance to display her skills fully. Like in Forrest Gump, I felt that serious moments were somewhat awkwardly acted - since I have seen better from both Hanks and Hunt in other movies, I'll blame the writing or director.In contrast to others, I did not feel this movie was ""disjointed"", the very distinct parts make sense from the story-telling point of view and emphasize the experiences of the main character.All in all I enjoyed this movie and it lingered on for while, even though the heavy, heavy Fed-Ex exposure almost managed to spoil it for me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Awe Inspiring!!!,"I watched this film years ago and the imagery is seared into my memory. The movie is pretty long but worth every minute. Hanks transforms his body in this film to match the situation of his role. It is very challenging for a single person to keep an audience engaged over the duration of the majority of a film, especially a long one. Hanks pulled it off and he makes it seem so effortless.Hanks carried this film on his back, up a mountain, through a blizzard while being struck by lightening. That is just how awesome he is in this film. The writing is flawless. The location is perfect.You gotta love the other star in this film, Wilson. Wilson had attitude and played his role well. Wilson took no guff and gave as good as he got. Bravo!Hanks acting was so on the mark throughout this film, even if you didn't speak English and subtitles were not available, you'd still get the gist of every scene because Hanks was just that good.My Braven Review Quiz Spoilers: b, a, a, c",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Hanks' Tour de Force,"Just saw this movie a couple of hours ago. Let me get straight to the point. This movie is not good, it isn't bad either but it doesn't deserve the attention it's getting. The first part (introducing the character(s)). We meet Tom and Helen, Tom is a sleazeball yuppie who only cares about his job, Helen euh... has no character. I didn't care about either one. The second part (plain crash) this was good, but not as good as the ""ALIVE"" plain crash, but it had it's moments. The third part(Tom only on island part 1). This is were the problems lie. It's very very slow, it's all about the nature cinematography (if you want to see this, please rent or buy THE THIN RED LINE) it was nicely done but not perfect. Tom Hanks is a good actor, but I simply do not care if, I know he is alone on the island, I know he will make a fire, I know he will learn to break coconuts, I know he will make an imaginary friend, (all seen in the trailer), but there's NOTHING more. This trailer ruined the entire film. That's why this part is very boring. The third part (Tom on island 4 years later and escaping). This part I enjoyed, we see a man who was spend 4 years of his life alone, of course he's cracking up, wouldn't you, but this part isn't long enough, In the beginning we only see the first weeks/months of his solitude, if you really want to see character development it had to be spread out more over the years, not only the first and last month. The last part(Tom and Helen meet again) some good parts (his sleeping on the floor/his disinterrest for being wet and the towel he gets) but mainly bad parts. The dialogue with ""Stan"" for not being with him when his wife died, and the scenes with Helen Hunt. So what do we got : Tom Hanks' role was good (oscar-nominated worthy, not winning) and another Robert Zemeckis film I just didn't get a real good feeling about.(Forrest Gump and Death Becomes Her being the others)",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

One of greatest movie I have ever watched,"First time I watched Cast Away, I'm loo little. But I can memories ""I'm sorry Wilson, I'm sorry"" moment. I'm Tom Hanks fan since watch this movie. Cast Away is a great story. This is the best cinematic example of what it feels like to be truly alone.Finally I have a big question, what was in the box with the angel wings, and why didn't he open it?",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
a very strong performance in a very strong film,"The idea of a drama about a lone person being stranded on an island has always fascinated me as a moviegoer. In real life, there have been many castaways such as the Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk, who spent half a decade alone on a tiny island off the coast of South America when he was confident that his ship, under deplorable conditions, would not make it back to port. Selkirk was probably the basis for this movie Cast Away. No, it's not a true story, but it's manufactured so well that if somebody was to tell you that it was based on an autobiography, you would probably believe it.Cast Away stars Tom Hanks as Chuck Noland, a busybody FedEx executive who's ""all about time"", who soon discovers he has all the time in the world when his plane crashes into the ocean and he, alone, finds himself on a deserted island where he ekes on the barest living possible. He improvises his own shelter, tools, companions, and accepts the fact that help may never arrive and if it ever does, it may be too late for him.This is an exceedingly wonderful movie. Not only is Tom Hanks the quintessential choice to play a castaway, but he does his performance so well that you quickly forget that you're spending most of your time looking at a superstar instead of a character. And you have to admire Hanks for his nerve to play such a character. When he first arrives on the island, Hanks is a tad bit obese, cleanly-shave, and perhaps a bit unsightly. When we effectively cut to a scene that takes place four years after his marooning on the island, he's a gaunt, scrawny survivalist with shrunken muscles, exposed ribs, and a hardly recognizable face through all of the beard and overgrown hair. In order to achieve this, production was shut down on the film for a whole year so that Hanks could lose a tremendous amount of weight and fit the description mentioned in the script. Now you have to admire an actor for such an undertaking.Cast Away was nominated for two Academy Awards after its release at the dawn of the century. One was for Hanks himself, the other was for the sound design and the sound, next to Hanks, is the most important element in the movie. The film clocks at two and a half hours in length and it's not until about seventy-five percent of the way through that we even so much as hear a click of music. The soundtrack is taken up by amplified sounds that heighten the feeling of a lonely place. The crashing of the waves, the howl of the wind, the grinding of wood against wood as Tom Hanks vainly tries to build a fire, the list goes on. Without such incredible sound design, I don't think the island scenes of Cast Away would have been half as effective. And it's because of these two important elements that the movie stays interesting rather than bogging down as one might expect. I mean, after all, you're spending a long time just watching a lone man struggle to survive on an island. And it's not like he's doing anything incredible like wrestling with savage beasts or running from cannibals or anything like that. Just an average, everyday man just worrying about whether or not he's going to live long enough to see home again.Before I conclude my review, I want to give just one warning. It has nothing to do with the film itself, it has to do with the advertisements. I saw the movie before I saw the trailers or the ads. And good thing I did, because I soon found out that the ads spoiled the movie from beginning to end in just a few minutes, ruining any feeling of question or the height of our expectations and thus, spoiling the integrity of the film. In short, see the movie, then watch the trailers if you want. As for the film itself, it gets an enormous amount of recommendation from me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"This movie,...SUCKS.","Okay,...let me start with the POSITIVES--I liked the plane crash.

It's not JUST the pathetic acting that made me hate this movie,...it's the script. This movie had the potential to be really interesting and profound...but then just as Hanks' character starts to settle in on the island, there's a blackout and suddenly the screen says: ""4 Years Later"".Um,...FOUR YEARS LATER??? Then,...why the hell did I come to see this movie??? So that I could see him reunite with rat-face Helen Hunt. Um,...okkaaayyy. Except that the reunion between the two is PATHETIC. The scriptwriters tried to pack the ENTIRE process of shock, grieving, reignited love, and realization that each of them had ""moved on"" into TEN MINUTES.What a load.The ending is so cheesy it hurt. And the imagery throughout the film is so blatant that it's insulting.They just skipped over EVERY SINGLE SCENE that I was interested in seeing.This movie's a STEAMER.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
All You Need is Hanks.,"I once stated that due to Tom Hanks being such a great actor that a film could be made with him being the only character and it would still be great. This film prooves that theory.Hanks stars as a fedex worker named Chuck. He gets stranded on an island and must survive there, the only possessions he has with him are a few fed ex boxes.This is a great survival film. Stranded on an island with no help makes for a great conflict that someone can relate to as it could happen to anybody.Tom Hanks is phenomenal in this film. He really plays a man stranded on an island well. Shows all of the emotions needed; fear, panic, excitement, anger, and determination. I never thought that anyone could make a volleyball seem like a person but this film did that thanks to Hanks great acting. THis really could be his best performance, but he has so many and I think it is safe to say that he is one of the greatest actors who ever lived.Zemeckis deserves a lot of credit too. THis film obviously had great directing and Zemeckis is a really under rated director in my opinion. Everything seemed perfectly right in this film.Great conflict and legendary acting. Highly recommended and easily one of Tom Hanks's best films and that says a lot.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"An emotional, uplifting, and positive  story of hope, faith, survival and perhaps Divine Intervention.","""Cast Away"" tells the tale of a successful and much revered Federal Express Executive who's dynamic life takes a surreal turn after he is the sole survivor of a horrific plane crash into the ocean. The storyline pits a business savvy workhorse against the wrath of nature in a desperate attempt at survival.At the core of the movie is a story of hope, survival, love, and faith. The movie explores the personal successes and failures of a white collar, high-powered Executive who's career and many aspects of his personal life are ruled by the clock. An unexpected and traumatic life-altering event removes Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks)from his regimented lifestyle bound by self-erected parameters, and deposits him smack-dab-in-the middle of a new life where he realizes that, ironically, he now has an abundance of his most treasured and precious resource-the resource of time.""Cast Away"" is an excellent cinematic experience for viewers who have a strong sense of faith, spirituality, and perhaps even divine intervention. Throughout the film, Chuck faces obstacles and scenarios that make ""Survivor"" look like a walk in the park. Everywhere he turns he is seemingly subjected to tests of his mettle and intestinal fortitude. Watching Chuck navigate each experience, the viewer cannot help but explore his/her own circumstances and wonder if they have what it truly takes to survive if they were left to their own devices. Notwithstanding the physical challenges, one must ask themselves if he/she could overcome the emotional and psychological challenges.Perhaps most importantly, I believe the premise of the movie is that you are only bound by your own parameters. You can survive just about any situation if you look deep down inside your core and pull out reserves you never knew you had. It also seems to teach you that you should never give up. However, if the situation is too much to handle and you have done your absolute best to survive, you may just get a little help from a divine source.Powerful, emotional, gripping, exciting!

Cast Away- Emotionally,"I believe the older a person is the  better one is able to understand what Chuck Noland experienced on that island. One has to be beat up a little to gain life's true perspective. Watching the movie several times I still am moved by Hank's ability to bring out the sadness of his character's plight. At 66 years old I see things in the movie that move me to tears. About my third viewing I was moved by the scene of his getting over the wave. As he turns to start rowing he looks back toward the island. That look on his face shows such ambivalence. What he learned on that island has such a bittersweet after taste. This is so significant to Chuck that he turns Wilson around so he can take a look. Then the rain and fog come in to fade out the island. Great stuff! This is where also the theme music begins,it has been silent on the island. What a moving musical score. It comes in when there is emtional conflict in the remaining portion of the story.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

A kind of modern Robinson Crusoe,"Tom Hanks once again performed very well his acting in this film. He certainly showed how difficult is the life for humans in areas where the so-called civilization did not yet arrive. At this point one should recall all what was taught at primary school to get fire, to feed himself, to sleep and to protect from rain and wind. He could not find any black Friday man as Crusoe did, instead he prepared a ball called Wilson as his only companion. Very strange that in that tropical island there were no mosquitoes or any other insects, at least he was not bothered by this problem, and the whale he found in the sea, was really very ""nice"", funny to see this sequence. What happened to his wife, who thought he died, may also happen to many other wives of soldiers going to war. In fact, she is still in love of his first man, and she married just to forget about him, but not because she was really completely in love of the new husband.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Good performance by Tom Hanks, good sequences on the deserted island, but the movie really only succeeds by a margin. *** (out of four)","CAST AWAY / (2000) *** (out of four)By Blake French:(this comment on ""Cast Away"" does contain material of a spoiling nature).""Cast Away"" starts on a fairly entertaining note, but devolves into a contrived love story and becomes buried in tedious sequences in which its characters have nothing to do. The main character spends most of the movie's dreadfully long running time alone on a desolate island-but we determined from trailers and TV ads that the character is retrieved after four years, which kind of eliminates the tension of whether or not he will get off the island alive.Tom Hanks plays Nick Noland, a systems engineer for Federal Express who intends to wed his long time girlfriend, Kelley (Helen Hunt), after he returns from a business trip over the south Pacific. We are not surprised when his plane encounters a horrible storm. During one of the most intensely convincing crash sequences ever made, the aircraft plummets into the ocean below, miles off course. Nick is the sole survivor, finding a resting place on a deserted tropical island. Time passes, he builds shelter, losses hope, but nonetheless survives. If you are not aware of his eventual rescue after four years, then you are not among the movies target audience. The story really focuses on Nick starting his life over and overcoming extreme odds. He finds out that Kelley became married and the rest of society has assumed his death. Nick's determination is encouraging, but the movie needs more detailing survival on the island. The scenes on the island are the movies best. The film is very careful not to become idle. There are constantly new situations and conflicts being introduced, even though their scenes are often slow moving and tedious.Tom Hanks does an exceptional job as the only real character in the film, all other's are plot devices. There are a few attempts to introduce side characters, but in a movie like this that is nearly impossible, although the actors do a reasonable job with what little screen time they behold.Director Robert Zemekis stays focused on a consistent narrative instead of going back and forth between characters, like the mediocre ""Six Days, Seven Nights."" This is a thought-provoking situation, but most of us already know how the plot concludes. The actual conclusion itself is actually dissatisfying and inconclusive. ""Cast Away"" is still a good production, well made, and beautifully crafted. I liked the directors consistent style and focused narrative, the plane crash sequence, and I give the film a marginal recommendation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The last act makes this a disappointment,"I remember the day I was going to see this film what I was thinking to myself.  I was driving to wherever, and I began to wonder how Hanks was going to get rescued.  It would probably be by a plane going overhead or he was going to make an attempt to sail off the island in some crude contraption of a boat and then be rescued by some ocean tanker that transports cars from Tokyo to Nova Scotia.  I then began to think of what expression I would have if I was the extra in the film that had the thankless non speaking role of the guy that sees Hanks first.  Would my eyes bulge from their forehead?  Would I look like I had just seen a ghost? Would I just stare in awe as the tiny boat floated by and was dwarfed by the tanker that I was on?  Would I be smoking a cigarette and it would just stick to my bottom lip as my mouth became agape?  These are all tough choices to make for an extra with such a vital role in the film.  Which one of these reactions actually happened in the film?  Well if you have seen the film, you know exactly what happened and if you haven't then you'll just have to read a little further to find out.  But just saffice it to say that it is issues like this one that made the film a 7 for me and not the 9.5 that it should have been.  And that is a shame.Cast Away is a very good film, it's just that it could have been one of the best if only they would have put a little more care into it.  Even though the film is a good 2 and half hours, it deserved to be three.  When you go to great pains to have a story of this magnitude then why can you not close the deal and make the last act just as good as the middle one?What is good about the film is the first act and what is even better is the second one.  We are introduced to Hanks as a guy that lives and dies by his watch.  He is always timing everything and he is so busy that he has to schedule in his girlfriend for New Year's.  It is a promise, he guarantees her that he will be home for this festive time of year.  So far Hanks's character, while a little intricate and obsessive, seems like many of us. We all live by the clock in one way or another.  It's just that he is a little more serious about it.  But in these times that we live in, we are all bound by deadlines, we are all aware of the time and we are all a little obsessive about our jobs at one time or another.  So again, we can relate to his character quite well.  Of course that all changes when the plane that he is on crashes in the middle of the ocean somewhere.  Hanks uses a raft to drift for days and he comes up on a deserted, almost uncharted island in the middle of nowhere.  It is here that the strength of the film is presented. And this is the most amazing thing about the film.  We are not only entertained with Hanks on an island by himself, but we want more.  We are captivated.  At least I was.  The film moves slowly at times when he is here but it also captures the feeling of isolation, loneliness, despair, hope and a plethora of other feelings in between.  Hanks does an incredible job of conveying these emotions inspite of the fact that he is the only thing on screen.  He has no one to talk to so he finds an inanimate object and gives it life.  It's name is Wilson, a volleyball that has washed up on shore that Hanks breathes life into.  Wilson becomes a great character and when it is in danger at times, it frightened me and saddened me that it was.  I have not experienced an array of emotions the way I did when he was on the island.  And as much as I wanted to see Hanks get off the island, I was completely engulfed in his time there.  When he eventually did get off, I craved for him to be back on that tiny island, with Wilson, his coconuts, his caves, his fire and all else that was there.  Up until his rescue ( and you knew that was inevitable, from the trailers ), this was easily one of the five best films of the year.  But what it did once he got rescued was very weak and very poor.  There was so much more that they could have done. There never was that reaction shot of the guy on the ocean liner that first sees him.  There was never really any reaction to him getting rescued.  It just happened.  I wanted to see everyone's faces and expressions when this man that has been lost for 4 years come home.  But not once did we get that. And that is what I meant when I said that this films should have been 3 hours long, hell it could have been 3 and a half, that would have given us closure and maybe a little more honesty.  As it stands, it is a good film, but with the combined talents of Zemekis and Hanks, it could have been so much more.  And that makes it disappointing.7 out of 10- Still a good film and a fantastic journey, but it lacked once he got off the island.  However, Hanks should be nominated for best actor and if he wins, there should be no complaints.  It is an incredible performance.  This film is worth seeing but it also worth noting that there are quite a few better films out there so far this year.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"""See our cast away, here on Gilligan's Isle...""","CAST AWAY has an interesting start.  Tom Hanks can carry a romantic drama. But this movie is not a romantic drama.Soon there is a jumbo jet plane crash in the Pacific Ocean.  The crash as depicted would truly splinter the aircraft and kill all, but anyway Tom survives.  Not only is he fully conscious and makes it to the surface of the water, but a lone jet engine remains high above water during the crash and begins to chase after Tom.  Tom escapes.There is a special effects problem here.  When Tom first makes it to the surface and while he is being chased by the jet engine, the ocean has small white caps.  But then after Tom escapes from the jet engine, the ocean instantly has giant swells.  First the ocean waves are too small to reach the bottom of the jet engine, then next they are three times bigger than the engine.  There is no continuity.Tom washes up on the shore of a small tropical island.  On the wide screen it might be fine, but on TV there is never a single shot showing the whole island.  The movie is spent on a beach always facing in the same direction. There is a strong sense that the ""island"" is only 180 degrees, and not 360 degrees around.To be honest, if I were lost on a small tropical island, I know I would starve to death within a couple of weeks.  Still, any person would do their best to try to survive.  There are some obvious things any person would do.A person would make a home base at a dry shaded location high enough to be far from big storm waves.  A person would take stock of everything they had. All man made items would be saved as being rare and precious.In CAST AWAY, Tom Hanks digs a hole and puts the dead pilot inside with all of his cloths on, and then covers him.In real life, most anyone would take the cloths off of the pilot and keep them because the clothing has high value.  Also, most men I think would use pieces of the dead pilot's body as bait for fishing.In CAST AWAY, Tom completely wastes the batteries to his only flashlight, and in general he acts like his ""frantic guy"" character from his MONEY PIT movie.  Too often, Tom is in ""frantic guy"" mode but it is not funny enough to be a comedy.The island portion of CAST AWAY does not ring true to life.

However, as is the case with many of Tom Hank's latest films, the message was more valuable than the price of a theatre ticket.Many times in our lives we find ourselves alone on a metaphoric ""island"", isolated from everyone else as a result of some tragedy or unwelcomed consequence that has drastically affected our lives.  And like Hanks' character, we find ourselves without the familiar surroundings or things we have taken for granted.  So we struggle to learn again many processes and procedures that before were simple and available to us.When the struggle becomes to much of a burden, we begin to wonder if it is worth the life that was presented to us at birth.  If that hurdle is overcome, then you realize that faith in the next day is all you have for hope.  And like Hanks' character was presented with material to form a sail to escape his predicament, we also carry the hope of surviving our experiences as a result of life's waves.The soliloquy that he delivers toward the end of the movie is priceless. He sums up his fears, his challenges, his triumphs and his failures with the statement, ""I have to keep breathing.  For tomorrow, the sun will rise. Who knows what the tide could bring.""The final scene with Hanks standing in the middle of a rural intersection is the icing on the cake.  For when we survive our crises, we find ourselves at a crossroads with many roads to choose.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Too slow, too long","Whenever critics or audiences recommend the Tom Hanks classic Cast Away, I inevitably come away scratching my head. There is no doubt Cast Away is a good film, but it has serious flaws that keeps it from achieving greatness. The stuff which has been immortalised into pop culture- Wilson the ball, or Chucks painful attempts at starting a fire- are indeed the stuff of legends. They are sequences which she'd great insight into the human condition- into the innate will to live, the adaptability and adjustability of the human spirit, or into how social interactions are crucial to human survival. But many audiences forget that the ""cast away"" portion of the film only occupies about 90 minutes in the middle. The tiresome introduction and the laborious conclusion- a conclusion which Dosent conclude much at all- occupies the other one hour of film. Chucks romance with Kelly feels contrived, and the ending does little to offer hope(which is what I think the ending was supposed to do). Then there are the ""survivor"" sequences. While this middle section does allow Tom Hanks to offer a raw, gritty performance of unvarnished intensity, it is largely dialogue-less, and moves much too slowly for my liking. There is not a great deal of suspense or intrigue to retain an audiences attention. Cast Away then, can only be a film remembered for its memorable moments. Apart from these moments, and an excellent Tom Hanks performance, the film is too long, too slow, and too dull.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A quiet tour-de-force for Hanks,"FedEx delivery manager Tom Hanks ends up stranded alone on an uninhabited island after a hellacious plane crash. Gorgeous-looking picture from director Robert Zemeckis does have its heavy-handed moments (Hanks looking and acting like a savage after a few years, presumably to make a point about man's raw beginnings), but these don't detract from the rest of the film, which is extremely well-crafted and well-paced. ""Cast Away"" isn't a deep, psychological portrait--but then it doesn't really have time to be. It's a movie about personal survival, a litmus-test, with sentimental trimmings (it has heart). It is also shrewdly written by William Broyles Jr. So that we in the audience find ourselves asking, ""What would I do in that situation?"" and ""Would I have thought of that?"" Engrossing and satisfying, the film once again gives Hanks the opportunity for an acting triumph; he holds the screen like a pro and gives a sturdy performance (although his weight fluctuation is a little erratic). In support, Helen Hunt is natural and inoffensive. Despite 'cute' overtures to instill audience good will, the picture is more honestly-rendered than ""Forrest Gump"". It holds a special power, one that should touch all different audiences very deeply. *** from ****",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
This movie couldn't be more dramatic..!!,"Cast Away is a 2000 film starring Tom Hanks. Hanks portrays a FedEx employee who is stranded on an uninhabited island after his plane crashes on a flight over the South Pacific. The film depicts his attempts to survive on the island using remnants of his plane's cargo, as well as his eventual escape and return to society. A very well executed story. This is a silent movie obviously A guy won't speak to himself in a lost island. Its about his survival and his battle with nature. This movie couldn't be more dramatic. A very calm and incredible movie, which will take you to a completely different journey to an island. The authenticity and Outstanding plot was enough to made me attract towards such a movie. In terms of acting Tom hanks did an awesome job. No wonder he got nominated as the best actor. This volleyball part was very innovative. Wilson is the name given to the volleyball which plays the role of a mute, infinitely patient, non-living listener in the movie, providing Chuck with a companion for the 1,500 days he spends on the island. Overall a must see flick which is a hell of a ride. I will give it 8 ratings out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Hanks can't go wrong,"Before there was ""Lost"" and before there was ""Survivor"", there was ""Cast Away"". ""Cast Away"" is Giligan's Island if Giligan were the only one on it, and if he were Tom Hanks.There was a t.v. show in the late 80's to early 90's called ""Parker Lewis Can't Lose"". They should have called it ""Tom Hanks Can't Lose"" because he is doing everything right. If Tom Hanks' popularity wasn't already astronomical enough, he just served to increase it with his role in this movie. How good of an actor must you be to have nearly an entire movie in which you are the sole focus. He was not the focus of several other characters, he was the focus because he was the only character. This movie, as simple as it was, was brilliant. Hanks did a great job as did the writers and director. Very few movies have mirrored the feat that ""Cast Away"" accomplished.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Life cannot be appeared.....,"His life, it was certain that he would get his wife, his house, and many thing.....That has destroyed by one storm. The only survivor was him. And small, tiny island. He tried to escaped sometimes, but he realized it can't help but fail because of high waves. He waited timing and after few years left, he finally escaped and came back to his life.The one thing I've impressed when I saw this movie is life's sadness, and many of ways to go in his case. Where will people go? Where will people choose? As the best way to go is not easy to be figured out, people always suffer from their choices. This movie tells this point exactly. The man, who drifted to a island, confuses many times until he escaped the island; if it is right to be alive and it is all unworthful in front of me....It shows people's typical life. This movie shows one person's victory and sending-off his new journal.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Review,"Cast Away is survivalist film starring Oscar award winner, Tom Hanks, that takes place on an island in the South Pacific after a disastrous plane crash. The main character ,Chuck Noland who is played by Hanks, works for the FedEx company shipping packages around the world. During a storm, Noland's plane goes down and he is stuck on an island fighting for survival. Far away from home and any form of society he starts to break-down emotionally and physically. The plot of this film is the strongest story I've ever seen captured on film. This is probably the only film that can make me feel distraught over a man losing a volleyball. Chuck is battling loneliness and depression while he is trying to survive. Hanks' performance makes the story come alive and really immerse you. The reality of the plane crash and the island was incredible. To further the ""realness"" of the film, they include Chuck's desperation to get home as he paddles in his deflated raft trying to get over the waves. The director and actor really worked together to show the emotion and desperation of this man Chuck Noland. I would highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys good movies. The cinematography is lacking a little bit as it uses elementary camera shots and angles. However, the literary element makes up for what the cinematics lack.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A ho-hum disappointment,"This is probably just a matter of expectations, but I found Cast Away disappointing. The opening 20 minutes are so action packed they take your breath away. Once on the island, though, things slow to a crawl. Tom's character is such a slow learner and not particularly clever. You find yourself wanting to give him advice. The physical effect of years on the island are totally unbelievable. He suffers numerous wounds, but looks buff and unscarred after four years. Huh? Once he leaves the island, you hope things will pick up but they actually get worse. There's too much wasted time and too much that is pointless. And I haven't heard one person who liked the ending.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"A movie classic called Cast Away, not Castaway","Cast Away is about a Fed Ex executive who is involved in a plane crash and has to survive on a deserted island. From that description you might think this is a rather mundane movie with no plot and no story. It could not be further from the truth.This, simply put, is a movie about time. It is a movie about the emotions that time evokes on any ordinary human being. You feel like you are in the movie and can relate to the characters and the story. Whether is it the deserted island, the romance, or the job you feel like Tom Hanks character, Chuck Noland.The one aspect of director Robert Zemeckis films that I think are perfect are how he uses metaphor to tell the story. In this film, there is a beginning and an end. And they are both perfect and complement one another. It is hard to believe that a film can make the viewer relate to such a long period of time in 2 and a half hours. But Zemeckis does it with this movie just like he did it with an earlier classic called Forrest Gump.There was one other aspect of this film that I realized myself and I wonder if others did too? If you type into a search for this film the word, Castaway, you will not find it. That is because the name of this film is actually Cast Away with a space. And to myself the meaning between the two titles is totally different. I think the hidden meaning is this: This is NOT a film about a castaway on a deserted island(like so many people think). It is a film about a guy, through some unavoidable event in his life, who is cast away by time and has to find himself all over again. The beginning and the end of this film made this point beautifully. This is a movie classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Huh? What a waste.,"One word sums up this movie.  Huh?  They made us sit through hours of watching this pathetic character bumbling around on this island. Why? So he could deliver a FED-EX package?!?

Speechless,"What an amazing performance, by Tom Hanks, who takes the viewer to a remote island.

A Damn Fine Achievement in movie making,"Hats off to Tom Hanks for one of the finest on-screen performances ever, he truly captures the loneliness, turmoil and slightly mad eccentricity that grows in the character of Chuck Noland.Hats off to Robert Zemeckis for daring to attempt this story, and running the risk of serious criticism from the shallow movie viewer, and i applaud him for pulling it off, without cheapening the experience.Cast Away uses no gimmicks, gadgets, special effects or dramatic music, in fact it uses no tricks at all to try and heighten the viewing pleasure for the casual viewer. It is simply the story of one's mans struggle against nature and a test of his will, and without question it works well.Cast Away is realistic, fascinating, touching and honest 7/10If its thrills that you're after then avoid it like the plague.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Tom Hanks is Incredible,"At the time of its release, this was Tom Hanks best effort yet. As he appears in nearly every frame, the film relies heavily on his screen presence and acting. Amazingly he pulls it off with considerable ease. I loved the narration and the way it was filmed, especially on the island. When it comes to realism, the plane crash was one of the best I've ever seen in any movie.In western society we come to expect so many everyday comforts as the norm and living without them is both disconcerting and frustrating. The central character's daily frustrations and loneliness are well presented and we all felt great empathy with him throughout. Plus, having audience members nearly in tears over a basketball is no mean feat, but that's what happened. Everything worked well and the story was rewarding in so many ways, especially towards the end. I found this film difficult to fault, incredibly enjoyable and would recommend it to all without reservation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Cast Away,"Tom Hanks excels in this well put together depiction of the archetypal, rather fastidious, business executive who finds himself stranded - after his plane crashes - on a remote tropical island. Completely ill-suited for life without any modern conveniences, but not without a brain cell or two, he has to adapt à la ""Robinson Crusoe"" to his new life of coconuts and whatever fish he can catch. The story takes it's time but that all contributes well to the effectiveness of his performance as he must deal with the physical, logistical and increasingly psychological challenges his predicament throws at him. Loneliness and despair fight against his human nature to thrive and to survive - and cause his creation of ""Wilson"", a sort of hybrid between a volleyball and a pineapple, for company! It was a Fed-Ex plane, which allows Robert Zemeckis to introduce some brief flashes of humour to lighten the mood - it's astonishing what people think to send to each other - and there is even a role for some ice skates to serve as a dentistry aid! As it progresses, we know that rescue is unlikely so are not surprised when his thoughts turn to venturing into the great, and turbulent, unknown - on a raft held together by plant threads and video tape. There isn't a great deal of jeopardy so the ending isn't really in doubt, but the effort here by Hanks and some solid writing and directing create quite a compelling and at times un-nerving film to watch. I've never really been one for the tropical island experience - I'm certainly not now!",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

A waste of film,"At the end of this film and found myself just saying 'why', why would anyone bother to make this film.  It didn't appear to cover any new ground; it wasn't a true story, so seemed rather pointless.The acting was fine, and some of the cinematography was good, but there were some basic errors.  The whale scene was poor; the scene in Moscow was a joke.  If anyone has visited Red Square, it's behind a number of pedestrian areas and although, in special circumstance, can be access via road, why would you.  Oh, because, to show you're in Russia you have to have the backdrop of Red square.  The scene in question was impossible, so I assume it was computer generated.  The cliché scene with Helen Hunt was so Hollywood' it was a bit sad.  Not to mention that she didn't waste too much time getting married and having kids, he was only gone just over 4 years.Overall, I didn't hate the film, it was a bit boring, but I just could see why anyone would be interested in such a poor, uninteresting story.",3.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Zemeciks & Hanks: They bring the Gump magic back,"This is one of the finest movies ever made. I've lost count of how many times I have seen it. It was only about the Director and the Actor.. both of them have done an excellent job. Four years in an island... all by yourself... no one could have thought of anything like that. The best 'silent' actor in the movie was Wilson and his attachment to Chuck (Hanks). Kudos to the writer and director for introducing this character in the movie. Many viewers would feel that after Chuck returns from the deserted island, the movie starts getting boring; and that the director should have deleted a few scenes. However, every single take in this film was related to each other.I would definitely give Cast Away a 10 out of 10 star rating **********",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

CAST AWAY (DIDIER BECU),"There are two ways to see this movie, the good and the bad way.... Let's start with the good one...if a movie depends on the acting of one actor then he has to be brilliant, especially for a movie that lasts 3 hours and the choice of Tom Hanks is (again) brilliant as he is a superb actor. The story of a succesfull businessman who lands on a desolated island is intriguing (especially when he lost his mind...just imagine what you would do!!!). Of course it's all a bit too Hollywood to be real but still a tour de force for Hanks who once again plays in the sort of movie the whole world talks about.

"A lesson for all of us, who do not enjoy life today as it happens","A movie of depth at many human levels, Cast Away was a unique film among the many of the great films of the 20th Century. And what a great film and story to start the 21st Century, this new Century that is certain to hold rapid change for the human endurance, as was the last. The main character, Chuck Noland lives in the fast lane, his life but a blur, representing a person who is but a cast away from family and life, a runner in a global world of change and commerce, with little time to ponder the important things in life, putting all the important things aside. But as fate would have it, Chuck Noland is cast away into another world, one of loneliness, and stripped to the bare essentials of life, in a quest for survival on a remote island, he is now a cast away from the civilization. Apart from the life he took for granted, and his love, he is stripped to the bare essentials, with only the slim hope that he might one day see his fiancé again, and not take everything for granted as he did before. With little chance of rescue, he carries the human quality of hope. Hope for rescue, and hope to see his fiancé and family once again, and this hope is granted through a sail, which starts him back towards a return to civilization.But his human struggle was not over. Upon Chuck Noland's return he must again cast himself away from the love he once knew, and cast away a love he once knew, that carried him through all those years of loneliness. Once again, in the middle of all of modern civilization, Chuck Noland is again a cast away from the life he knew, and is alone again. But as fate would have it, he would find himself again with hope, as he struggles to return to the meaning of life. and like the winds that helped rescue him from that desolate island, he again finds hope in the emblem, an image of angels wings that had sustained his existence for a very long time. And in this moment, among the empty expanse of land, not ocean, he once again casts away his past, and must begin a new life, where time is not a master, having learned to enjoy life as it comes. It is this meaning that all humans must learn, or suffer being a cast away in the sea of humanity, in a world of sea of change.A story perhaps, but maybe there is something more meaningful for all of us...and a lesson we could all learn easily.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Flashes of brilliance are held back by a slow opening and a thematic shift in the third act.,"There are flashes of brilliance throughout 'Cast Away (2000)', mostly during the daringly dialogue-free mid-portion when Hanks is stranded on the island. It's when the story is told visually that it's at its most compelling, with the central performance remaining captivating throughout and the sense of isolation feeling palpable. It does have some pacing issues, though, including a slow opening that struggles to make you care about the character and an off-pace third act that takes the focus away from survival - placing it on living instead, which works thematically but does seem a little dull compared to what came before it. A film that can create a compelling relationship between a man and a volleyball has to be admired, though. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Great movie,The greatest movie i have ever watched.The struggle of tom hanks shown makes the movie forget. I liked Wilson the most in the film and tom hanks treats him as friend this concept is remarkable and that is the he does not tend to forget speaking as it has been long time 4 years. Planes crash looks like real.The struggle shown for collecting food and water is amazing. The best scene in the movie is lighting fire.

FedEx not mentioned anywhere near enough at beginning,"I started watching Castaway thinking it would be just another Tom Hanks caper like Saving Private Ryan or Big. How wrong I was! Only saw the first few minutes, but for some reason I became so emotional at how great FedEx are that I just had to go and post something. If only FedEx appeared in more movies. I love FedEx. I doubt UPS have made such a fantastic appearance in ANY movie, EVER (they're so poop they'd probably be in a french film, ha!).Anyway, Snickers also makes an appearance, but they're only mentioned in passing. I'm presuming that FedEx got something to Tom on the island, against the odds, and saved the day. I'd want FedEx to appear in my autobiography if I was parcel oriented.Come to think about it, what really let down The Godfather was too few mentions of FedEx. If only Marlon Brando had said something like, ""I'm going to take him a parcel he can't refuse"" THEN it would have been a great film.Anyway, I hope we won't have to wait too long for Castaway 2.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
No Tom is an island,"Watch the ads for Robert Zemeckis' new movie and you'd think that this is a movie about a man stranded on a deserted island, a la Robinson Crusoe. So did I, but Tom Hanks' character doesn't wind up on the island until a good 20 minutes of filler material have been used. Filler material, in most movies, is the kind of plot information that seems superfluous at first but is later tied into the plot itself. So we're 20 minutes into a movie and finally see Chuck Noland (Hanks) on the island. You can see where this review is headed, can't you?First off, there's the title. Cast Away? Why not Castaway? Why make it into two words? A puzzlement, to be sure. I know, I know... nitpicking! No, it's not! If it's two words, it says to me someone has been cast away - but Chuck hasn't been cast away, he's been marooned. Maybe the makers didn't want anyone to confuse it with the Survivor TV show. I think they should have gone with the one-word title, but hey - that's just me.The movie is a little over two hours long, and in the bulk of that time we follow Chuck's exploits on the island. We see his trials, his failures, his successes, and his thought processes. And it all really is mesmerizing, as long as you suspend some of your logic processes. This happens with a lot of action/adventure type movies, because the focus is on what's happening, not why it's happening. Sometimes you'll see an illogical chain of events in an action movie, and you'll dismiss it because you're there to see the action, not to be bothered with the plot. Well, friends, I am bothered by it! I wondered how Chuck survived the plane crash and why he got out what looked like everything in his pocket just before the plane hit turbulence but once the trouble started he only grabbed his precious pocket watch. I wondered if I was watching a long commercial for Federal Express (see how many logos you can spot).I've seen some people say this is one of the top movies of the year. Sorry, I can't see that. It's fun to watch, but the compelling stuff in the middle is surrounded by a beginning and an end that slow down the pacing of the film immeasurably. Sure, I care about Chuck's beau Kelly (Helen Hunt), and I know that setting up their relationship at the outset is somewhat important. But it's more than a little contrived when his last words to her before jumping on the plane are ""I'll be right back."" Come on! All of the supporting plot surrounding his adventures on the island seems to be horribly contrived, as if someone said, ""Great, love the whole island thing, now throw in some more stuff  so we can get over 2 hours out of it."" I mean it all seems almost tacked on, and it's all too pat. I will say this much, though: the ending is NOT cliched.Hanks is better than I expected. He's not really the adventurer type, is he? In some scenes, with his scraggly beard and makeshift clothing, he looks like Lawrence of Arabia or maybe Moses from The Ten Commandments. He effectively shows emotion, determination, perseverence, wit, and ingenuity. I'd also say he ages well, too, but then you have to remember Robert Zemeckis filmed this movie in two installments so he could do What Lies Beneath; this layoff allowed Hanks to transform from girly man Fed Ex dude to strapping strongman (sort of). Everyone else is just extraneous. This is Tom's game.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A refreshing change of pace with a touching story,"'I'll be right back!' Such were the words shouted by Chuck Noland to his girlfriend Kelly Frears as he hurries off to catch his waiting plane. Little does he suspect how horribly ironic these words become once his tale is over.In Robert Zemeckis' great 'Cast Away', Tom Hanks incarnates Chuck Noland, a highly-efficient FedEx executive whose life is mercilessly governed by the clock. He's in a relationship with Kelly Frears (the pretty Helen Hunt), yet their love is constantly postponed or halted by Chuck's unforgiving timetable. Soon he's called out on a business trip just before Christmas, and he and Kelly exchange some quick gifts: she gives him a pocket watch with her picture in the lid, and he gives her an engagement ring box, which she is to open on New Year's Day only  with him there with her. He then leaves and boards the plane.Unfortunately, something goes terribly wrong during the flight (we never learn what, nor is it relevant) and the plane smashes somewhere into the Southern Pacific ocean. The crash scene, with all its technical and visual excitement, is the most terrifying and heart-pounding sequence of its kind I have ever seen. It's so sudden, so unexpected, and so realistic, that you can't help but feel nearly as shocked and horrified as Chuck himself as he sees clouds, and eventually waves, scream past the cockpit windows, coming ever closer  He is the only survivor, and soon he washes up on a large and eerily magnificent desert island, and a quick look-see confirms his worst fears: he's absolutely isolated in the middle of the ocean, and no-one knows where he is  or that he's even alive.By then we're barely a quarter into the movie, and the pace, formerly so fast-paced and hurried, suddenly crashes to a halt. All time stands still on the island, itself unchanged for millions and millions of years; only the dull thuds and cracks of falling coconuts, or the occasional arriving flotsam, provide distraction to the new routine Chuck has to endure: survival without any electricity, food, water or equipment. Everything he uses, he improvises  sometimes with painful results, other times with triumph. A man who once lived by the pager and the timetable suddenly finds himself in a land where the very concept of 'time' is as alien as fish on Mars, and what he does to survive, both physically and mentally, is where the true storytelling power of the movie lies.The movie is very slow-paced as we follow Chuck's attempts at staying alive, yet unlike most other times where I'd say this, for this movie, being slow is far from criticism; it's praise. The movie doesn't hurry through Chuck's exploits and actions just to 'get to the point'. The story takes its time to settle comfortably into its niche, and once it does, it's truly riveting, even though all we're really looking at is one man on an island, drinking coconut juice and suffering from a toothache without a dentist.The acting is outstanding, especially for Tom Hanks as the castaway in person; he supports the entire movie, and the audience gets to feel both his triumphs and his pains. One scene where he finally is able to light a large signal fire is surprisingly jovial and heartwarming as we see the desperate man jumping, ecstatic, around the burning flames, chanting and avoiding sparks. Other scenes truly make us feel terribly sorry for the man, but rather in resigned, compassionate way. For example, to stay sane, Chuck begins to speak to a Wilson Sporting Goods volleyball, on which a smeared bloody handprint inadvertently created a vague face. Naming the ball 'Wilson', Chuck speaks to 'him' as thought they were old friends, and by then we're so in-tune with Chuck's desperation and loneliness we barely even realize the oddity of a grown man merrily conversating with a volleyball.I naturally can't divulge what happens at the end, or if Chuck ever makes it off the island or not, but I can nonetheless comment on the fact that personally, I found it slightly disappointing. It was a logical ending to the tale (one you may already have guessed if you haven't seen the movie yet), but some parts of it seemed forced, even somewhat clichéd and corny at times. I also didn't understand some of what happened at the very end; perhaps it was too subtle for me. (But then, 'too' subtle would also be ground for criticism.) This is not a movie for viewers who expect action and flash, or for sufferers of short attention spans. For those who are able to take a break from their lives, which so often mirror Chuck Noland's in their pacing, this story will be a soothing and refreshing change of pace while it lasts, and will make a very good addition to any movie-lover's collection.* * * * * For giving us a story with a refreshing change of pace, a lot of sentiment and depth, and some formidable acting, I award 'Cast Away' 8.5 friendly volleyballs out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"""WILSON????!!!!????""","This movie is so ridiculous, I am going to have a really hard time making fun of it.  All I have to say is that five minutes in, my friends and I were taking a sip anytime the (enter name of delivery company that rhymes with ""Red Rex"") logo is onscreen.  That was the prologue.This movie *NEVER ENDS*.  The prologue alone is about five hours long.  But finally the plot kicks in and things pick up for a while.Tom Hanks washes up on the island.  He wanders around for days and days. When he isn't wandering around, he yells at the animals in the forest to be quiet.  They don't listen to him.And then, when things couldn't get more crazy, when I couldn't be laughing my rear end off any harder, we meet Wilson.Wilson is the most interesting character in the movie.

Interesting Film!,"Cast Away is not a bad movie as some of the negative reviews say. This is certainly not an ad for Fed-Ex. What this movie is is a serious piece of art by acclaimed film maker Robert Zemeckis that stars Tom Hanks.This film is about Fed-Ex worker, Chuck who gets stranded on a remote island in the Pacific Ocean. That happens because his airplane crashed. Now, Chuck has to outwit nature in order to survive and come back home.The acting is great. The only two well-known actors are Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt. Hanks did a phenomenal job.I will admit that some things are incredulous and boring at the least. Some parts are slow especially during the island scenes. The scenes with the volleyball made me think, ""What the heck?"" The thing that gets this movie to work is the odds of surviving on a remote island no one have ever heard of. Overall, this is a basic survival film. I rate this film 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Love this movie!,"I simply love this movie because of the uncertainty as regards to what happens next during the entire movie!I find it hard to believe that Tom Hanks did not won a Oscar for his performance, since he in my opinion deserved it more than anyone else.If you have not seen Cast Away yet, I definitely recommend you to see it right away. I promise you will be blown away by the story and the great performance by Tom Hanks.All the best, Pernille",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The final scene...spoiler,"spoiler alert? I really enjoyed this movie. It is amazing to think that Tom Hanks carried such a huge part of the film by himself. There wasn't even much music. during his time on the island, without much dialogue, he was amazing. Not too many actors could pull it off, I think.In the last scene, after the girl drives off in the pickup with the dog in the back, Tom Hanks stands in the middle of the intersection staring, then the movie cuts away. What is he staring at, and what is he thinking. What did he decide to do? I can't quite figure out what he is thinking. Does he get an ""aha"" about what direction to take and why?

Slow but engaging drama that is driven by Hanks' brave performance,"Chuck Noland is a driven employee of Fed-Ex.  He has a loving girlfriend and a lifestyle that sees him travelling the world.  When he takes an overnight flight across the Pacific, his plane crashes killing the crew but he escapes on an inflatable dingy.  Washing up on an island Chuck finds himself shipwrecked and must survive until he is found.I wasn't won over by the idea of this film when it came out at the cinema and gave it a miss.  However on TV I'm graceful enough to give anything a chance for free!  In this case I had no hype or bad reviews about the film to colour what I thought of it, coming to it fresh enough to have an open mind.  Fortunately I was in a patient mood and looking forward to seeing it, so it didn't bother me that the film was very slow, although I can understand why some audiences were straining at the leash for more pace. For me the story itself was interesting enough as a human story to defy `things happening' - it was Chuck I was watching the film for, not a fight scene or a dramatic rescue.For this reason the film succeeds - to me it was dramatic and engaging on a character level and, because things were always happening to Chuck, I didn't need some constant bit of plot to be happening.  The film is quite brave in that way and, while other reviewers have criticised the ending, I thought it displayed good taste and control - imagine trying to get that ending through a pitch or a preview audience!  Most films would have looked for a more positive and conclusive ending - but this one was very good.Hanks does great work to hold the attention for the whole film - he is barely off screen for a minute of the whole 120+ minutes.  His performance is good; whether he is acting normal or talking to a volley ball he is convincing and never dull, he makes it very easy for us to get into his character and his situation - which was vital to keep the audience interested.Overall I really enjoyed this film but I do feel you need to be ready for what you're sitting down to.  It is slow paced and, if you're impatient, then you may feel like `nothing's happening'.  Hanks does great to hold the audience otherwise and the film is grown up and lacking in the sort of syrupy smaltz that could have killed the film.  Not perfect but an great story well told if you're in a patient mood.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Survival movie,"Cast Away has a strong resemblance to Robert Zemeckis' previous film, Contact. Forrest Gump was part folky feel-good drama, part sly satire. Cast Away may not be as well-known, but it provides a richer, more satisfying experience. The third act of the film provides no easy solutions to difficult situations.Screenwriter William Broyles Jr. And director Robert Zemeckis avoid melodramatic clichés. Because he is on screen by himself for more than half of the time, Tom Hanks is responsible for the film's success. Helen Hunt, who became a film fixture after ""Mad About You,"" is the only other significant player. This is unquestionably her best work in a long time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Cast Away,"CAST AWAY – 9.3/10Director: Robert ZemeckisWriter: William Broyles Jr.The greatness of a film is normally traced to the director; there are no two ways about that. We seldom know who the writer is and are even less curious as to who it might be. Cast Away is a case-in-point; it made me shout half way through the film – ""who the hell wrote this"" ? One of the finest stories of the 21st century, there is much more this film talks about than what it was given credit for. The director, Robert Zemeckis (Forest Gump fame) needless to say has done a brilliant job, but what needs serious mention is the writer – William Broyles Jr.The writer marooned himself for a week on an island to understand what people do in survival situations and consulted several survival experts. Cast Away deals with the very basics of human life; it pokes the viewer with questions we never ask ourselves. Or maybe the need to ask these questions never arise - Why are we here? The film has a strong existential undertone and Tom Hanks as Chuck Noland, a FedEx employee marooned on an island after a plane crash, has given one of the finest performances of his career. The film deals with the struggle of a man who must survive, for the sake of surviving. Chuck, after repeated attempts, has given up hope of returning to the civilized world, and after realizing he has no control even over the way he wishes to die, he simply lives on with the memory of his would-be-wife – Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt).During the period when Broyles had marooned himself on an island, a ball came in with the tide and pop came the idea of the inanimate character – Wilson. Broyles highlights how a man is so helpless and no better than a rock, if his existence is not recognized by another. The character of Wilson has given the writer some creative liberty to make the film something not close to a silent film, and this stroke of genius mixed with some luck has been craftily used. The cinematography is commendable and the almost one sided conversations throughout the film are interwoven with hidden philosophies and memorable humor.An emotional poetry of love, fate and belonging, Cast Away is a milestone in Hollywood cinema. To breathe so much life, meaning and humor into a subject so dark and tragic, needs pure genius. Chuck's longing for Kelly and his ultimate acceptance of his fate in the final scene between them is a timeless poem that will outlive the film's critics and lovers. Man needs to belong; that is the very crux of him. Don't forget this. This film won't let you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

You just need to watch it and patiently wait until the end as it carefully wraps up the amazing journey.

It would have been more powerful without him finding ""new love.""Robert Zemeckis is a gem of a director.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Story about survival,"Cast Away is a story about survival. Chuck Noland is a Federal Express systems engineer whose ruled-by-the-clock existence abruptly ends when a plane crash leaves him isolated on a remote island.I was most impressed with the plane crash sequence which takes place about 20 minutes into the film, after Chucks character has been established and the equilibrium is understood.Chuck, along with the crew of a Fed-Ex aircraft are travelling above the Pacific Ocean, 200 miles off course. At this point the audience realises there may be something wrong, as Chuck is told by a crew member to fasten his seat belt for a bumpy ride.The camera is hand held and is no higher than Chuck's shoulder height throughout this entire sequence. This helps us feel closer to Chuck by being involved in what is happening to him. The audience is seeing what Chuck is seeing as the sequence is shot from his side of the story. We never know more about the situation than Chuck, and this adds to the fear.The fact that the camera is quite jerky makes the viewer feel uneasy, as though in danger. These types of camera movements are necessary as there are no external points of reference to show the plane is moving.Suddenly there is an explosion and within a split second Chuck is being sucked out of the bathroom. This is a very dramatic sequence as the entire mood of the film changes suddenly. The camera is positioned on Chuck, as he is clinging for life onto the bathroom door frame.The sound becomes one of the most effective elements of this sequence in creating fear and panic.  The noises of the plane as it descends are abstract and eerie. A mixture of engine noise and wind howling through the plane become the forefront of the sound, and almost block out any other noises, for example voices of the crew and the banging of objects flying round. This creates a very frightening yet surreal atmosphere, which you may expect if thrust into this situation.The camera remains with Chuck, following his actions and watching his reactions. Although there are other people on board the plane, the viewer's main concern is Chuck's safety.The camera techniques used during this sequence go a long way in creating a very intense and terrifying atmosphere. The camera movement allows the viewer to realise the danger the aircraft is in, whilst also creating a documentary style which gives the viewer the feeling of actually being there.Also, the hard cuts and swift pans and tilts again give a factual feel, allowing the audience to be a part of the scene. This technique makes it seem as if there has been no creative image processing involved, and is a very clever example of how a camera can be used to create an atmosphere so intense.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

However, the fact the film is followed with an optimistic note and has some truly moving sequences, gives us all hope there might still be a light at the end of the tunnel.

A deserted place with no signs of civilization in the vicinity? Exhibition of some of the most drastic weather conditions? An effective central protagonist? To whom we could relate? For whom we could show some empathy? With 'Cast Away', Zemeckis seemed to have ticked all the requisites! A beautiful, beautiful movie with a wonderful message that propagates the true value of everything around us, including our very existence.To be honest, It's quite difficult to put my exact thoughts into words right at this moment, since I am pretty overwhelmed by emotions.

Even though I have always had the utmost respect for such survival tales and the people involved in them, who against all odds, have never given up on their hopes and their will to live another day.Still, never would have I imagined that I would be moved to tears, that I would lose control over my feelings, that a darn volleyball would make me feel devastated; this was something else! I have yet to witness a lot from Zemeckis (including Forrest Gump), but following my time with Back to the Future Trilogy and now this movie; one thing I can bet on is that this guy knows his craft, he knows how to create lasting characters, and make people fall in love with them!

Cast Power is more like it,"Contrived, overly pompous, predictable, and uncompelling is the best way to describe this overrated film. If you saw the previews for this film, there was really no need to see the movie. In the previews they showed:A) Tom Hanks as a Fed Ex delivery guy who's girlfriend is Helen Hunt. B) Tom Hanks getting on a plane. C) The plane crashing. D) Hanks stranded on an island, so long he eventually grows a beard. E) Hanks saying he'd ""rather take his chances out there than die here"", as he floats away on a raft. F) Hanks making it back home. G) Hunt running out after him in the rain.There were no surprises!

Notice the commercials pitched it with ""Zemeckis and Hanks team up for the first time since Forrest Gump!"" I'd heard the initial concept was Tom Hanks' idea too. That doesn't surprise me. The last time Hanks had an idea for a movie it came out as That Thing You Do!. A word of advice for Tom Hanks: Stick to what you're good at. That's ACTING. Leave the writing to the writers. Not that they got a good one at that for this film. The scenes with the ball and where he starts a fire were just so pompous and overly dramatic.

Difference between living and surviving - exemplified,"The commitment to create a marvel does not stop with the director, it sure goes a long way than that. This movie sure proves the point and when you look at Tom Hanks in the start of the movie and then on after the mishap, the physical transformation and the commitment to make this movie work from the actor is commendable.Creating a story out of delicate issues such a plane crash with a legit company name (FedEx), we are aware there will not be any heroism or any racy sequences which is a selling point for a commercial potboiler. But if the creators can compromise on the fact the movie can be rated ""Documentary"" then a real-life event can be adapted. But this movie is neither a documentary nor it has stupid goose chases. Still wins in every aspect of movie making and the credit goes to the director's mammoth effort and enacting it on the screen by Hero.Many movies had limited characters with which the movie churns its story, here it has been limited to ONE. All over the movie you see Tom Hanks, except for the start and the end. Being a authoritative FedEx employee Tom hanks has sure got the grit to survive the ordeal and head back home from a deserted islandIn such movies the end is always predictable, the hero lives to tell the tale, else how could we even recreate his suffering. Despite this fact the creators gives a gripping experience of his daily survival. Effective utilization of the resource, logic for his actions and the pain, agony that the character goes through everyday are the selling point of this epic.There has been very little use for special effects team, but for the limited usage they have done a exceptional job. The wreck is sure looks real and whole incident is eye catching.

Engrossing,"Robert Zemeckis will probably never again reach the heights of ""Forrest Gump"", but I'm glad he continued making quality movies such as this one. Like ""Forrest Gump,"" this movie is one of a kind; it's unlikely we'll ever see another movie that takes the risks that this one did. To make a movie where over three-quarters of it is just Tom Hanks, half-naked and not talking, takes a lot of guts and a lot of skill. So did ""Forrest Gump,"" and Robert Zemeckis pulls it off again, though not quite with the same knack for weaving sentimentality into genuine drama that he displayed with ""Forrest Gump.""The first two hours or so of the movie is brilliant. Zemeckis and Hanks present us with Chuck Noland, a by-the-clock-or-die FedEx supervisor, who is obviously in love with Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt), who, just as obviously, loves him back. He boards a plane to Malaysia to deliver some packages and tells her he'll ""be right back."" The plane crashes in the Pacific. Chuck is the only survivor and is washed up on a deserted island. And there is where the real movie begins. We see Chuck learn how to survive and fend for himself in sequences that could have been slow and tedious but, with the realism in which they are presented, become fascinating.Tom Hanks's performance is just plain great. He takes up most of the screen time and Zemeckis lets us see into his passion and despair. Hanks, in fact, never takes a wrong step. It is the screenplay that trips up in the last 20 minutes of the production. Some people say the ending feels tacked on. I disagree; most of the ending is just fine, and fits right into this examination of what a real person would do in a situation like this. However, a few of Chuck's lines near the end strike a forced note- not because of Hanks delivery, but because one feels that no one could say something that cheesy well.Even so, this is quite an experience. Not as creative as ""Forrest Gump,"" to be sure, but who cares? I don't think Zemeckis will ever try to beat his masterpiece and if he keeps making movies like this one he won't need to.

"Quibbles with ""Cast Away""","I was quite impressed with many aspects of this film, but I have to point to a couple of quibbles which helped keep it from being the fully realized work of art it could have been:1)The first 15 minutes of the film contain as many product placements as I can remember seeing in that short of a time. This is a MAJOR negative to me, as it destroys the suspension of disbelief and immersion in a cinematic world which is so important to the enjoyment of narrative film. The profusion of FedEx logos was comical at times, as in the Moscow airport scene. The film would have been far more effective, in my view, if Hanks has worked for a fictional delivery firm rather than the real-life FedEx. My teenage son argues that use of brand names makes the film more ""realistic."" I firmly disagree. The use of brands and logos is a constant reminder that you are watching a commercial enterprise backed by labyrinthine financial deals. I thought this was a major problem with ""ET"" as well. (I would give them a pass on the ball called ""Wilson"" - that was a pretty good joke, but overall far too many product references.)2) The filmmakers make the same mistake that Defoe made in ""Robinson Crusoe"" - the ending is too long and anticlimactic. If you've read ""Crusoe"" in its original text, you may remember the superfluous episode of a race over the mountains to Lisbon after Crusoe's return. In ""Cast Away"", judicious editing could have shortened the denouement by at least 10 minutes and still made all of its points.

"Good, but not as good as I thought it would be.","This film like a lot of films was hyped up and did not, in my opinion, live up to the hype. It was to me, very slow moving to him finally ""arriving"" on the island. The acting was good and the story was easily comprehensible, but overall, it is a better than average Tom Hanks movie. I think the FedEx scenes were long and drawn out and were not completely necessary to the plot. Tom Hanks talks to Volley ball(Wilson) on deserted, uncharted island!! That is the basic crux of the movie.In other words, been there, done that(Well, maybe not a Volley ball)!! I think that Hanks saved this movie from being less than adequate.

An Unbelievable Tale of Life and Survival,"If you haven't seen this movie, you have no idea how a ""one man"" movie in a single island can move your mind and emotions like the way it will.

I didn't care for the way the movie ended, but I wasn't as interested in the movie by the time it ended.It's not Hanks' best work, but it was still a good movie.

"Been wanting to see this movie for year, finally did, and was left with an ehh impression.","When it comes to Tom Hanks while I will give him his dues because he is a great actor. Some of his movies for me I either loved, hated, or it was somewhere in the middle. Thats where this one falls in my opinion.Pros:-The visuals for a movie of its era are great. Especially when it comes to the water, island, etc.-Tom Hanks did great job acting in this film. He was beliveble and made you very enthralled with his pain and agony throughout as man struggling to survive-Without giving to much away the movie is very touching and emotional. Makes you do alot personal deep thinking about quite few things.Cons:-This complaint I've seen from quite few people as well. The middle of the movie gets very boring and draggy after while.-I thought the movie could used more scenes about his life as opposed to excess of ones they did on the island. While it did show some personal background it wasn't enough in my opinion.-The ending I felt was abrupt and wasn't fan of. I know some people enjoyed it but after all that I just wanted little more out of it.Overall would I recommend this movie? Definitely depends on type of movie goer you are if you're someone whos into deep acting and good story yes you'll enjoy this film.

An Exceptional Film,"What would you do when faced with tragedy? How would you react if you had no human interaction for a year? Would you be able to make it without the amenities that we enjoy every day? Would you go crazy? Would you kill yourself? Cast Away puts you in this situation. We get to peek into a tragedy situation comfortably from home, while Tom Hanks fights for his survival for us.Our main character, Chuck, is a FedEx manager. He is extremely focused on getting his job done in a timely fashion. His job keeps him very busy due to his trips around the world. The film picks up right before Chuck is about to take another trip. While on the flight, Chuck awakes to turbulence. After a few minutes of struggling the plane crashes into the ocean. Chuck survives by hanging on to a life raft. He eventually loses consciousness and awakes on the shores of a remote island. He quickly finds that there are no other inhabitants of the island and that in order to survive; he is going to be pushed to his limits.Cast Away explores many themes. Coping with loneliness and isolation is something that is hard to display in film but is shown beautifully throughout this film. The cinematography does an amazing job at getting these themes across. The film features very little dialogue, but you won't even notice it due to the very visually appealing sets. Long shots out towards the ocean and aerial shots of the island get the points across easily. Such a potentially dark premise is given a bit of light with lovable, comic-relief such as Wilson.It is hard to find a drama that everyone in the family will enjoy equally. Cast Away is no exception. To get the point of the film across darker elements had to enter into the film such as suicide. This isn't the movie that you bring the whole family to, although mature children could handle it and most likely enjoy it. Cast Away receives a 9/10 from me due to the exciting premise and unique way of telling it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
what Gilligan forgot to tell us,"Maybe we wonder how many movies and/or TV shows about people stranded on uncharted islands there can be. ""Cast Away"" of course portrays Fed Ex employee Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) getting stuck on a Pacific island after a plane crash and having to use his own ingenuity to survive, even after he ends up looking like a cross between a beggar and Moses. I personally think that they could have just left it at that and not had any of the stuff about his relationships with people. But Wilson made an interesting character. Of course, a particularly unpleasant scene portrays his dental work. Overall, I guess that there's not much here that we haven't seen, but Hanks's performance keeps everything afloat, especially in the fire scene.And I guess that Gilligan did forget to tell us about the coconuts.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The best Fed-Ex commercial I've ever seen.,"What a waste of time. After you're done watching various Fed-Ex trucks and planes go off into the sunset, you're left with Tom Hanks on a deserted island, not able to come up with anything interesting to say or do. After about thirty minutes of island ""action"", the screenwriters  completely ran out of ideas and had to resort to the good old ""4 years later"" trick to get poor Tom of his island asap.

Hanks is Revelatory in His Beach-Stranded One Man Show,"There's really a whole lot more to this than just Tom Hanks alone on an island. It works on a visceral level as a straightforward tale of survival amidst the harshest conditions imaginable, but underneath the surface there's all manner of allegorical goodness also at play. It's intense and powerful no matter how you choose to take it, though, and that's the sign of a real masterwork. That whole stack of cards teeters on Hanks's work in the central role, of course, and he flat-out crushes it. In a way, his whole career up to this point has been preparing him for this kind of an effort; I can see shreds of many of his earlier roles, alive in his gamut of expressions, as he slowly, grimly comes to terms with the fact that there's no form of rescue on the horizon. He's familiar but lost, a modern-day everyman denied his tool belt, stripped bare to the very core of his being. It's an all-world performance, easily among the best of his career, though it didn't quite draw the accolades that his turns in Philadelphia or Forrest Gump enjoyed. Behind the lens, Robert Zemeckis also hands in some of his best work. Experimenting with before-their-time camera angles and quick, effective snapshots of daily life on the island, he's able to evolve his craft without losing touch with his typically warm, lush brand of storytelling. And, needless to say, Cast Away's famous crash scene remains one of film's most historically intense, white-knuckle rides. I didn't realize I'd been holding my breath until it was all over. A fantastic picture that only stumbles in the payoff, lingering in the moment for longer than it really should, then momentarily giving in to its indulgent, romantic side.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Cool Idea Just WAY Too Long,"I was sitting inside at a café with this on the TV dubbed (what little dialogue there is) into Spanish. I wasn't really paying attention, but I decided to watch it again. I can't remember what I thought of it the first time around which probably means I didn't think much of it. That about sums up my thoughts after rewatching it. There isn't a lot to like.For one thing, at 2h23m it's simply too long. It would have been a lot better had the survival techniques been handled better. As it stands, this guy would have died of dehydration of starvation after a few weeks, if that. He was very slow on the uptake in the learning process. He never had a good source for water, his food supply was weak, and it took him forever to light a fire. He buried the pilot with most of his clothes on, clothes he desperately needed. A dead guy doesn't need his belt. There is no way a guy with such a slow learning curve would have made it four years alone.Speaking of fire, why didn't he make a fire at the top of the island?I could have done without the whole Wilson pseudo-character, or definitely a lot less of it. Ditto that for him gazing lovingly at his girlfriend's image on the watch. He could have made something out of the ball and he could have burned the photo of his cheating girlfriend.He builds the world's worse boat and sends himself out to sea with nothing in the way of supplies. Without sufficient water, he would have died in 3-4 days, tops. The chances of running into a ship would be little to none. And where did he have the package he delivered? Up his tuckus? It wasn't on the raft.To top all of that off, he goes home and expects that his woman was waiting for him? That was less likely than his raft being spotted by a ship.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Another example of the excellence and diversity of Tom Hanks acting ability.,"This is a movie definitely worth seeing, and for myself, watching about once a year. I have enjoyed Tom Hanks in a number of movies, this one being near the top of his list. The scenery is spectacular in a confined environment. His struggle and his evolution to primitive being shows the determination to live, where many would simply lay down and die, wallowing in their own self-pity for being stranded seemingly without hope. And his recovery from devastation when he realizes he has lost the love of his life for the second time, shows a similarity to the persona he had to bring out, simply to survive the adverse conditions in which he found himself when he crawled out of the ocean. An absolutely excellent film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"A very good, but not great movie","A film that relies a lot on the main role, which carries almost the entire film on its back. Luckily it's Tom Hanks so we have a solid movie with great acting. It relies on the physical, but even more on the psychological change of a man who remains alone on a desert island. Although in one way the plot is reminiscent of Robinson Crusoe, here we have a slightly more modern approach, but also the consequences that are dealt with and how it all affects the main character. We even have a life message, a lesson. In all aspects, a very high-quality film, although I personally would not put it in the category of top achievements, especially since both Hanks and director Zemeckis have much better works in their careers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

The movie is overlong and flawed, but it has great moments of seriocomedy and melodrama. Zemeckis does manage to give us insights into isolation and half-insanity with masterful results.

"Bad, pointless film","CAST AWAY  - MINI REVIEWPLEASE NOTE THAT SOME OF MY COMMENTS MAY GIVE AWAY CERTAIN PLOT LINES OF THE FILM.Cast Away could have been a great film -- but it turned out to be a real disappointment for me. The plane crash and the subsequent challenge of surviving on an isolated island was quite fascinating. The problem was that the relationship between the Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt characters wasn't well established. It seemed forced and rather phony. One minute Hanks' character is calling his lover from Russia, in a rather matter-of-fact tone, telling her he loves her. He barely turns off the cell-phone and he's back at his high-stress job. If only the director had given him even a few seconds to dwell on his recent conversation with someone he is supposed to be madly in love with. I just never bought the love story aspect of it, so when he returns after being stranded on a tiny, deserted island for over four years I just didn't care about her or their relationship. Far too much time had passed, both in real life, and in the movie. Having Hanks stare at tiny fading photo of her just didn't work. I think Helen Hunt is a fine actress, but her tom-boyish looks don't do much for my libido. And if the audience can't feel what the protagonist is supposed to be feeling, well -- it just doesn't work does it?I also couldn't understand why the movie dragged on for so long after his rescue. The film would have been much better if it had ended at that point.The scene when the freighter glided by his raft was fabulous.There were a lot of great scenes in this movie, but they didn't lead up to anything dramatically. His relationship with Wilson, the volleyball provided the most tender moments in the film. Wilson should be nominated for best supporting actor. Sure his acting was a bit stiff at times, but it was better than the mushy acting that preceded Hank's disappearance and certainly much better than the absurd acting and dialogue we had to endure in the aftermath of his rescue.Maybe I was expecting too much after reading all the great press.All in all -- a real disappointment.",3.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

At Least an Hour too Long and Never Really Takes Off,The first thing that strikes me with this movie is how irritated it makes me during the scenes when our Robinson Crusoe tries to make a fire.

"Good storytelling, better sound design","I remember when I was a kid and this movie used to be on TV all the time. I never watched it back then, mainly because I wasn't into movies, but it always stuck with me in a weird way. Now that I have seen it after all these years, I can say it's already one of my favorites.The central theme of the film is time, this is established from the very first moment Chuck (Tom Hanks) appears on screen. Time does not forgive!The story in Cast Away (directed by Robert Zemeckis) is told in a very innovative way. There is basically no dialogue during the second act, and still, we can feel Chuck's emotions as our own. His fear, desperation, loneliness, and pain, we make them our own. That is a feat not many films can accomplish.The product placement is not subtle in this film - you will be seeing the FedEx logo a lot - but at least it integrates well into the narrative. It's almost a sin they didn't use Message in a Bottle by The Police at some point in the movie, but since music is absent in the film I can understand what the director was going for. Where this movie really shines is in sound design, and that's the main reason that the second act felt so magical despite having so little dialogue. By removing the dialogue they had to rely on other ways of storytelling, and they did it brilliantly! I have to admit, at times the storytelling feels lazy, they almost mastered the art of show don't tell, but there is some telling here and there too.After watching the film I asked myself: what's the lesson here? Honestly, at first, I thought there wasn't one, but after further thinking I started seeing things in a different way. Chuck's journey teaches us that life goes on, and you have to cling to it until the very last moment.All in all, Cast Away is a film worth watching and rewatching. The direction is brilliant, the sound design is remarkable, and Tom Hank's performance as Chuck Noland is outstanding. One cannot ask for more.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Robinson Tom Hanks(o),"I have to admit my summary line would have worked even better if it wasn't Tom Hanks but Tom Cruise in the main role here ... that funny anecdote aside, the movie is quite the tour de force. But as every good story you'll have to wait until the island story begins. When it begins though, there is quite the hard story to go through.You may start thinking: What would I do in a situation like that? Apart from maybe not working for Fed Ex (or any other postal service company, which I reckon you can make as much fun of as you want - for good reasons), you probably would have quite a few issues. Or maybe not - I know that while survival instincts would kick in ... I'd have quite the trouble. And Hanks character does too ... we see how he has to learn so many things ... or to live without so many things. Most of us are used to a safe place, electricity and so many more things that make our lifes easier ... nowadays even more so than back then ... cell phones have made us ... quite dependent on them.And with no possibility to charge them ... we probably would have major issues to determine or find out how to do things that should be common sense ...

Tragic Romance/Drama/Adventure,"The sheer genius of this script has unfortunately been overlooked by many. First of all, this is indeed, a Romance genre, but it is more of Drama genre, with Adventure as the spine for the Desire Line. And further, this is Tragic Romance: Oh! What could have been! The Hero's Desire in the beginning of the story is to be a workaholic, and by the way, he's also getting married to a great girl. The script does not dwell on the Romance genre from the first few pages – Therefore, the audience doesn't have a vested interest in the Hero and his love interest despite the fact that their very meet-up is the Inciting Incident of the story. We also see, from the very first scene, the symbolic importance of ""time,"" which is ironic, as the Opening Story World is barren, empty, almost as if time has no beginning or end here – Very symbolic use of Story World for the writer. This ""time"" element portends for what lies ahead in Act 2, on a desert island where ""time"" no longer has any significance. The genius of writing this Story World is that man must find beauty no matter where he is: Noticing the stars, the flashing lights of the moon, the red/brown of the Tennessee clay, the clapboard houses set off in the setting sun, the isolation on an island that is barren, yet lush with vegetation. How difficult it is when man must survive and bleed and make mistakes as the Hero of this story does – All to survive, which is the new Desire Line beginning in Act 2. To write a Hero in an adventure/drama/romance story, the decision must be made as to which genre should be primary. In the case of Cast Away, the writer decided on Drama and Romance as the Designing Principle, and Adventure for the spine of the plot. The Hero's Desire is to find a way to survive and get rescued. The island is both his savior and his prison. He understands this, as time goes by. The photo of his great love is also his savior and his prison, as he knows he will probably never see her again. Adventure is a sub-plot of Action. However, this is not an Action story by any means. In Action genre, the Hero must think ""on his feet"" and engage in action at every turn. Honor is the driving force behind an action Hero. The elements of Drama override the Action genre here though – There is a very strong moral dilemma in Drama genre. The characters are intimate and the Opponent is also a known entity, as opposed to Myth, whereby the Hero encounters dragons and slays them, one after another. In Cast Away, the Hero says that he even tried to hang himself at one point, but true to form, after he tested the bough, it broke and even his attempt to kill himself was not in his power. The Premise of a story for film should include three elements: The Hero; the Inciting Incident; and the Hero's Desire line. So the Inciting Incident should have been the plane crash, if Adventure (sub-plot of Action) were the genre that took precedence. But the Inciting Incident is when the Hero and the love of his life meet up during the Christmas holiday, thus taking from the Hero a break in the concept of time that means so much to him in the beginning of his Character Arc. So the screenwriter made a very important decision: The Romance genre, key to the Designing Principle, is really the key to the plot of this story, as opposed to the Adventure/Action genre. But the Hero's Desire Line is in sync with the Adventure/Action genre. The fact that his Desire is also to be reunited with the love of his life is the moral dilemma that he has always faced for the better part of his life. So herein lies the genius of this story: Sometimes a love that keeps us alive might have to be given up due to life's circumstances. There is a story element called a Double Reversal in Romance genre: Both the Hero and his great love do a reversal from where they were emotionally in the beginning of the story. We see this in a very powerful way in Cast Away. Both characters have a moral epiphany and then a Self-Revelation that has most of us in tears because this is a cathartic experience for anyone who has ever loved and then lostThe genius of the writer was to have the FedEx employee whose wife was dying of cancer as the Hero's audience, while the Hero is telling in exposition before the Moral Epiphany and Climax scene what the Designing Principle of this story was really all about. About the use of Wilson, the volleyball, as a character: Obviously, to craft a story with a Hero on a desert island would be a challenge. Because in film, as opposed to novel, the audience needs to know what's in the character's mind- what his feelings are- his emotions, etc. So the Point of View Character, also called an Ally serves this purpose. The writer came up with the idea of Wilson, the volleyball, so the Hero would have someone to emote to and thereby express his feelings to the audience in a believable way. Again, the cathartic emotions we feel are that if we were stranded on a desert island and we had the ingenuity to craft a ""volleyball friend,"" we would absolutely do it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"wonderful movie, but very sad","this is a pretty original movie. what would you do if you were stuck on an un-known south pacific island by yourself? i liked the quiet nature of it. i mean tom hanks is on his own the majority of the movie. that must be really lonely to be without human interaction for 4 years. his loneliness gets the best of him and he forms a ""friendship"" with with a volleyball he names wilson....get it? hehe. a lot of the elements were pretty depressing. tom hanks does add his flavorful humor though. very superior acting (its pretty much a one-man show). helen hunt did really good. its not exactly a feel good movie, but it is quite enjoyable. if you have a quiet nature and enjoy more serious dramatic movies, this is for you. i loved it. 10 stars out of 10.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Guaranteed to shed a tear,"A very good movie, Cast Away, brings to the screen the story of a Fed-Ex employee who is stranded on a deserted island in the Pacific Ocean following a plane crash. Once there, it is his thoughts of his loved one and of home that provide him with the necessary strength to endure unprecedented difficulties. Cast Away is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength. Tom Hanks is superb in his role as Chuck Noland, and although the rest of the cast do not have that many lines in the movie, nevertheless, they have outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least. All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows! The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all good! In short, Cast Away is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Hanks delivers the goods, Wilson fails to bounce","Castaway, Tom Hanks plays Tom Hanks, he's great doing this so I won't be too critical. Tom, a manager of a Fed Ex distributor, ( there's a lot of product placements in this movie) lives and breaths the company. When on a overly long plane journey one Christmas much to the annoyance of his ever suffering friends and girlfriend. His plane goes down, being the only survivor on a desert island in the Pacific Ocean. Hanks desperate for food supplies starts to ransack the surviving fed ex parcels much to his annoyance and in a frantic search for his meat and two veg cuts his hand, during this search he finds a Wilson basket ball, which he discards due to its lack of taste. Unfortunately he smears blood over the ball. Overtime the bloody pattern begins to look like a face, Hanks starts to talk to the ball and calls it Wilson ( product placement again)Well I won't go into too much detail needless to say the Fed Ex man is true to his word and delivers the goods.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
a really enjoyable and exciting movie.,"I enjoyed this movie throughly.I do not normally watch movies with Hanks as the lead as i find them pretty dull. This was an exception.I saw this on TV and thought it was really well done. The scene were Hanks plane crashes, and he finds himself on an island were he must work with nature is especially well done. The lighting and waves were excellent.The character Hanks plays, is an uptight and busy man. When he goes to the island, he meets his worst nightmare, Time. With nothing to do and no comforts he makes himself friends. He takes a simple volleyball, names it and with this, remines sane.I have only three small faults with this movie. The first is that the time on the island is a little short. He doesn't even spend half the movie here.This isn't really a fault is just me but does anybody ever wonder what is IN THAT STUPID BOX?? Sorry, but really what's in it? He says he saves his life with that box, so what's in it? Tell me if you know please, sophielambe@hotmail.com . Thanks.This is also not a fault but there should be a sequel!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Had potential,"...but devolved into typical shallow Hollywood fare. There were some really lovely, genuinely moving moments (like when he discovers a fellow passenger who perished in the airplane, when he is completely alone on the raft and is crying)but they were overshadowed by a lack of commitment to REALLY explore human terror and loneliness. They didn't go far enough into the insanity that was only hinted at. I found the stuff with the ball (wilson) annoying if only because it came off as cutesy instead of desperate.  I had a hard time believing that he was really stuck on the Island for four years and there was little to help alleviate this feeling. I was far more focused on the knowledge that Tom Hanks had lost all that weight and was thinking of the newspaper articles I had read. The real waste for me is that the filmmakers put their toes in the water at various points in the film which showed that there was the potential for more.  Robert Zemeckis should be made to take a page from the Steven Soderbergh handbook to see how you can make Hollywood movies with balls.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Good, but not great","Tom Hanks is king. That's what I think after watching the movie. His transformation is totally amazing: from a very slightly overweight man to the a very skinny person, from a very hard-working employee to a survivor, Tom Hanks simply amazes me.The crash scene is the most terrifying aircraft footage I've ever seen. The sound effects actually made me feel uncomfortable and nervous. A masterpiece.Wilson was a great idea.Sadly, the rest of the film left a lot of issues unexplored. It should have avoided the ""before"" and ""after"" story, instead concentrating on Hanks' loneliness at the island. The ""silent"" part of the movie was the best for me. I could've cared less about his soon to be wife, or his friends at work. It was pretty obvious how all that would finish. Very cliched.Oh, and if you don't know by now who paid for the movie, watch it. You'll all agree it was FedEx. At one point, I even got to think I was watching an infommercial, where Hanks demonstrated that ""not even being a castaway will stop FedEx from delivering on time!"".

Cast Away?  Perhaps that should be Cast Out,"I'll start by admitting that Tom Hanks does nothing for me as an actor.  In fact, I think his only two decent films to date are Big and Philidelphia - and that's at a stretch.  I went into the film with a healthy dose of skepticism, but was fully prepared to be surprised.  Oh well, one outta two ain't bad!This is the sort of film where, if someone asked me what it was like, I respond with ""the cinematography was very good"".  Hanks joins Robert Zemeckis for the first time since Forrest Gump (don't even get me started on that waste of film).The story itself is one of survival (d'uh!).  Chuck is a jet-setting Fed-Ex efficiency expert who jumps on a plane, and the plane decides to jump into the ocean.  Chuck survives and has to eke out a living on a deserted island. That's all there is to it really.  Oh, he's kept company by a picture of his girlfriend, Kelly and a volleyball named Wilson.There were some fleeting glimpses of brilliance in the film - how Chuck overcomes adversity living on an island, cooking, fires, home dentistry etc, but nothing too extraordinary.  In fact, boring in parts.  I think the film could have benefited from cuts to what's happening back home while he's on the island - mind you it would have meant involvement from the other actors - which would have spoiled the ""Tom Hanks alone in Cast Away"" effect of the film.  Oh OK, credit where credit is due, Hanks did trim down fantastically for the film, and he looks, well, not that bad!  I think taut would be the word.  But that's enough gushing!  Fed-Ex too, must be rubbing its hands in glee with the free advertising this film has provided for them.It's a film that I wouldn't recommend highly to people, but at the same time, it's OK and worth a trip to see it on the big screen (because I think it'll lose a bit on the TV).Now would someone please explain to me why Tom Hanks keeps winning these damn Oscars, because I'm stumped.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"good film, should have been set in the 60s","My only real complaint about Cast Away is that it is virtually impossible to get lost on a tropical island, WITH a life raft (since rafts nearly universally I think, in this modern day have emergency transmitters (EPRBs or something like that)  that can be picked up by satellite and your location gets sent to the coast guard).  The jets radio black out is also rather implausible. The lack of infection from a major injury in topical (bacteria infested) waters is also at least extremely lucky. One of the things I liked abou it is that its sort of just a story of a guy going through an amazing experience, just s slice of life, not major upheaval and resolution and etc etc, an amazing slice of  life due to the circumstances, but just a guy somehow managing to get thorugh it.  Could have been you or me.  That, in addtion to the excellent direction, on location etc. gives it a very realistic feel.  I think Philadelphia is still Hank's best work, but Cast Away is good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Tom Hanks Never Disappoints,"I loved every bit of the film. The movie brings to life the thought of ""What would I do if I was stranded on an island?"" Tom Hanks acting was amazing as he brought life to his character Chuck who is trying to survive with what little he has on an island alone. The dedication he gave to his role with the drastic change in his physical weight was crazy and the emotional change he brought to his character as he goes from a sane man to almost losing it, then humbled was four stars. The filming was amazing with the beach and water scenes, the CGI with the plane was a little lower budget, as it would have been better with real props. It's entertaining to watch Chuck survive on the island as it's real and down to earth, nothing he does has you saying, ""there's no way, that's impossible."" Instead the movie is extremely practical, which makes it enjoyable. The only downfall is how the end drags out a little, mixed with bitter sweet feelings. But still a great film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Cast Away over rated,"I heard  many great things about Hank's performance in this movie. When I watched it, I couldn't help but turn my head at times, not because of grotesque scenes or scenes that were too real. Instead, there were scenes of Hanks getting down on his belly and melodramatically licking water droplets. Come on!  Also, the scene where he 4 years later, can harpoon a fish from 20 plus feed out.  The camera pans up to him standing there..all stoic..nonesense. I realize that some of this is the directors fault, letting Hanks go too far with some of this stuff. But for the people tauting this as ""Hanks for Oscar"" etc. ..no way. Also, the last 3rd of the movie lagged and could have editted to half. Not a great film: too long and too many melodramatic scenes. Also, the whale scene was so fake I couldn't take it. With all the modern technology these days, that scene was pathetic. As for the product placement, I didn't find it distracting as it was part of the story, fortunately or not.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Wiiillllssssonnnn!!!!...,I found this a totally absorbing film; one of those that make the time pass much more quickly than you expect. You very quickly get involved in the story and you find that you actually care about this man stranded on this island. You really want him to survive and get back to the woman he loves; and you feel his pain when things don't go quite right. It's quite emotional and can be quite harrowing in places. Some people don't like the ending but I really did; it leaves the audience to decide just what he'll do next Loved this one.SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDMy score: 9.2/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.,9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Tripe,"Zemeckis and Hanks sure know their audience as this movie has pulled in a gross totally out of proportion to the films quality.  I am just glad that I saw it for free and didn't contribute my $9.50.As many other reviews here state the cheesy ending when he finally returns to Memphis (some four weeks after he was rescued) spoiled even further an already mediocre film.For those of you who want to see a film that accurately portrays life as a cast away then rent ""Castaway"" (1987) starring Amanda Donohoe and the late Oliver Reed.  That film may not be the greatest but provides a more realistic portrayal of life on an island and may help you fill in the gaps in what Hanks may have gone through during those ""missing"" four years.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Well, Hanks is good.","There are movies that are part very good but in the whole unsatisfying. This is one.  The plane crash and struggle to the island are well shot.  Hanks is great in his struggle to survive on the island both physically and mentally. Wilson as a companion and primitive god is a good device.  Unfortunately the love story that surrounds the action in the movie's construction is too thin and doomed from the outset to eliminate any reasonably ""happy"" or meaningful conclusion. Two people pretty well absorbed by their respective careers, Hanks a Fedex exec and Hunt working on a PhD, cannot quite find time or the full commitment to formalize their relation. A dramatic accident that creates the action and one person show for Hanks. Finally, rescue after 4 years and confrontation with Hunt who has moved on. Hunt however does deliver both a ""you are the love of my life"" speech and a ""I had a really hard time after you were lost"" line.  Please.  How could Hanks have a meaningful relationship with Hunt if she honestly believed that her hard times had any comparative aspect to being lost on an island for 4 years of near Hellish suffering? Who can believe that Hanks would want or expect Hunt to leave a husband(why cast ""Big"" from Sex in the City?) and child?  The three items that kept Hanks going were Wilson ( a mixture of god and inner values), the package ( a commitment) and the picture of Hunt (love interest).  In the end he's left Hunt, delivered the package and lost Wilson.  Yes he can wander any of the roads open to him as in a new life. No, it doesn't make sense or pull the movie together.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Superb,"I can't say much about this stunning movie that others haven't said before me but I did want to remark on a few memorable things. The deeply portrayed emotion between Helen Hunt and Tom Hanks - utterly sensitive and spellbinding. The plane crash scene, probably the greatest cinematography and special effects of such a scene in all of cinema. Makes the shaky-cam effects of TV's Mayday look like rank amateurs. Also Alan Silvestri's magical, haunting score. Without that score it would have been a loss for the movie equally as great as when Chuck loses his one true love.

Cast it away,"This movie is really hard to criticize mostly because not much is happening.The whole plot seem to be this stranded guy misses his fiancé and his love keeps him going, bot lo and behold he is for 2nd deserted when he returns and gets stranded on the plains of America this time along with a symbol of Americn consumerism - an off-roader.The only time some real cinematography is on the verge of breaking out (probably an oversigt by the director) is the first camera motions which lends itself from North by Northwest by the great master.I can truthfully state that this was about the dullest film I have ever been unfortunate to witness. I see no dramatic storyline, no depth of character, no development, only a captain's log of things the stranded fellow does to survive, none of which is even original apart from the dental operation (Don't try it at home) Imagine the great monologues the main character could have given in the depth of the Pacific night elaborating with newly gained wisdom like an Indian hermit.Helen Hunt does a fine job creating a character though but the exhaustion of blowing life into the shallow script takes the better of her and she faints. Probably what the director conceives of a climax.The movie is going nowhere as was the stranded fellow, and it is all rounded symbolically up by Hanks returning to the point he started, only with a loss of 4 wasted years. He was lucky. The spectator wastes 2 fine hours.I can only say: Avoid this Scyllian reef at all cost and cast it away if the movie strands on your coast.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

For all those things, Cast Away gives an example for every one of them. It gives us inspirations to lead us to a life full of enlightment, and love for oneself. Not only this movie gives these valuable messages in life, but for me, it does tell us how beautiful the world really is. And on how we can love and interact with it, for all our problems and struggles we can just look at on how pretty the world is.

Hanks and Wilson Can Do No Wrong,"Baseball. Cool Ranch Doritos. Tom Hanks. What is more American than these three things? That's what I thought. Nothing.Tom Hanks will forever be America's funny, charming Uncle. He's a guy you want to be like, makes you feel better when you see him, and most importantly, you are sure he would like you too. He's the kind of guy who could be stuck on an island with only an ugly sweater and a volleyball, and you'd still want to watch him do his thing. And if you've had dreams like this, I know I have, you're in luck, because there's an entire movie with this exact premise; Cast Away.Chuck Noland (Hanks) is a hard-working, oft traveling FedEx honcho. He's well liked and respected, and all signs point to Chuck having found the woman for him in Kelly Frears (Hunt).It seemed like just another routine flight aboard a FedEx plane, to which a smiling Chuck says to Kelly, ""I'll be right back."" The rest as they say... is history.It as at this point that we get to see the true talents of Tom Hanks really take flight (no pun intended). After a truly amazing plane crash sequence, this becomes Tom's movie.Hanks literally transformed himself for this role, gaining and then losing 50+ lbs, and growing his hair and beard so long it that surely made ZZ Top question their own follicle abilities. After years on the island, the result is a rugged, fish catching, shelter making, fire starting, tiny shorts wearing survivalist who would no doubt make Bear Grylls proud.Hanks is nothing short of mesmerizing on screen. As one of the most recognizable people in the world, it's not easy for an actor of his stature to completely fool the audience in thinking it's somebody else on that big screen, but Mr. Hanks rises to the challenge again. This is not Tom Hanks, this is Chuck Noland; A man thrown into a situation few will ever experience. And in becoming Chuck, Hanks has shared with us one of the greatest performances the cinema has ever seen.I will not go into the specifics of what takes place on that island. That is for your eyes only.This is simply a great performance in a phenomenal film.Go watch Cast Away.Thank me later.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A keeper movie . . .,"Twenty FOUR years later . . . Latetothe show again . . .But I actually own this on DVD & have seen it a dozen times or more - I just never wrote a review for some reason . . .This is a great movie, lucid reviewers proved that. It's immersive, interesting, & compelling.I was curious to read the low reviews - and I guess now, once again, I review the reviewers more than the movie, but this may help anyone new to seein' this movie to know -Of 40 or 50 low reviews I read, it was clear almost none had any logical reason for disliking the movie. That's ok to a point. I mean sometimes, maybe, (ok - rarely) an actual adult just can't explain why they don't like a movie . . . . in that case I would suggest, rate it via the 1 to 10 stars & don't write anything.The worst group of low reviewers are the ones who apparently hated the movie so much they ignored the actual scenes & story line & made comments that clearly indicated they didn't even really watch the movie. Almost every thing I read regarding plot holes or missing story was unnecessary to write - if they had actually watched the movie. To these I say, do not rate by stars or words.And there's always a few people who watch & simply can't follow a story line/'dont get it' & then somehow think it's helpful to tell everyone they just don't get it. Um, it's not, so maybe avoid writing reviews.Then there were the ongoing, endless reviews essentially calling this just a 'long FedEx ad'. It was not in any way 'advertising' for FedEx. If a movie shows a huge number of trees, or sweaters, or cell phones, or dinner plates, or books, is that all advertising or pushing somethin'?The character was driven by his consuming work ethic, in an occupation that relies on communication & speed, and which he was going to be devoid of for 4 years. To add to the story of main characters ironic situation, the company used provides a service that's totally familiar & relatable to every person in almost every way
(which it was so perfectly portrayed in the film) So, whether you are a person dedicated to or consumed by your job or career, or if you work in any form of delivery, order things to be delivered, or you simply ship &/or mail things in any form thru any company, this is all relateable. The vast relatability of the characters profession is why a well known company like FedEx was used.We saw the character at work at his job, his dedication to the meaning of his work, we saw the crash, crisis, and aftermath, which all would necessarily & obviously show it's trucks, boxes, buildings, employees, & all.Incredibley stupid for people to think or complain that a story about a guy who works for FedEx in a job-related crash should not show the obvious images related to everything that happens in the story!FedEx actually did NOT pay for their use here. I believe they recognized the wide range of relateability to the vast majority of people who work for a living and allowed their company to be used. If it expanded their business, great.I found this movie to be exceptional, therefore a keeper which I enjoy watching again & again. And if you're fortunate enough to watch the special features, you liked it even more because of the hard work & talent both behind the camera & in front of it, that went into this great production.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Average for a Tom Hanks outing,"Cast Away was only an average Tom Hanks movie, which does means it was better than a lot of the major studio stuff out there, but it was nowhere up to the level of Philadelphia or Forest Gump.I liked the fact that the ending was the way it was...not necessarily happy, not necessarily sad, and I liked the look of the island that Hanks was marooned on.  The one problem I had with the film was that there was no initial indication that a FedEx executive would've had all of the survival skills that Hanks exhibited...but I suppose that there really would've been no way to foreshadow that in the opening part of the storyline.  I would have also liked the film to delve more into what Hanks was thinking while on the island...perhaps digging a bit more into his past.  It seemed his life began and ended with Helen Hunt...there had to be more to what made him who he was than just her.I viewed the DVD version of the film and found most of the second disc to be pretty lame...the survivalist featurette was interesting at times, but the Wilson featurette was lame...I know why the ""character"" was there and why there was a need for it, but to overly glamourize it like had been done was just dumb.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Disappointing,If the makers of Castaway were trying to convey how boring it is to be stranded on a deserted island -- they did a fabulous job.  The pace of this movie is mind-numbingly slow and the characters were undeveloped.

"Great acting, dopey script","Cast Away is sure to nab another Oscar nomination for Tom Hanks, and in a relatively weak year for film he may just win his third.  He would deserve it, and not just for his physical transformation.  Any other actor in the world would get laughs if they recited the dopey dialogue (or monologue, I guess, since he's alone on that island).  I can't imagine Ralph Finnes being taken seriously if he proclaimed ""I have made . . .fire!"" but Hanks somehow pulls it off.You may be aware that the studio moronically gives away the ending in the trailers and commercials--it is inexcusable and blunts much of the emotion of the situation.  This is a solid film with a fascinating second and third acts, but a flat-footed fourth act.  They paint themselves into a corner with no satisfactory ending, and then fail to come up with a satisfactory conclusion.

Movies with predictable scenes can take away your interest in watching them, but this movie has a ton of scenes that you just won't see coming. It was a perfect balance of funny, thriller, drama and romance all put together. If you haven't seen this yet, you gotta pop some deliciously sweet kettle corn.

A real life story of loneliness,"Robinson crusoe movie that I watched at a time that corresponds to many years ago. But it's weird that people go to the movie and squint and stare with the line ""Aaaa. It is obvious that such a theme will be encountered from its advertisement to its story. The only question mark would be how to tie the ending.I went to the movie knowing all this. All I was wondering was if Tom Hanks gave an Oscar-winning performance. And I still remember a single scene with Tom Hanks acting that is etched in my memory:Tom, who managed to light a fire on the deserted beach, showed the fire with joy as if he had erected a great monument around the fire and proudly as if thousands of people were watching and applauding him:look what i have created...""i""....i have made fire.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The real message of the movie is NOT about being stranded on an island,"If you haven't seen the movie, don't read this discussion, because my discussion might give a hint to the ending of the movie.The real message is you shouln't treat your professional life more importantly than you personal life.When Tom Hanks was having a joyous dinner with his girlfriend, family, and close friends, he was interrupted by a telephone call from his company. He was told he had to leave and travel half way around the world to fix a problem for his company.Next thing he knows, Tom Hanks was stranded by himself on a island. He couldn't leave the island for years.When Tom Hanks finally got back to the real world, the love of his life (Helen Hunt) has already married to another man. (Ironically Helen Hunts was married to a dentist, and Tom Hanks had to remove a bad tooth when he was on that island)I was so touched by the scene when Tom Hanks went to Helen Hunt's house for the first time, after Hanks came back from the island.They had soooo much love between them. But so much has changed since the last time they saw each other, when they were having that dinner when that phone call came, and when they exchanged Christmas presents in that car, just before they said good bye. Helen Hunts has already married to another man and they already have a baby.They still love each other so much. And they know they were meant to be husband and wife. But they know that they couldn't turn back the clock.Remember the scene when they remove the baby seat from the car?The message of the movie is your love ones are more important and precious than your job and career.I was so emotionally touched by the last 15 minutes of the movie, I almost cried.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Cast Away: about as thrilling as a nap,"Well, Tom Hanks acting was good, the location was good, and the photography was good.

"Long, depressing, dreadful commercial.","This thing is way too depressing for a holiday movie, and the most shameless ""product positioning"" movie I've ever seen.

And the ending - a crossroads experience??  An eyebrow raising leer, for heaven's sakes?  Gaack!I must give credit to the makeup artists and Hanks for the ageing and weathering process - well done indeed.  Hunt's cameo appearance (it really can't be called much more than that, surely) was wooden at best - absolutely no rapport with Hanks; and his performance was only mediocre.A movie suited best for late night TV - they wouldn't even have to interrupt it for commercials, since that's about all there is to watch.",2.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

The ending is a bit to long but it serves the point, and i love the last shot of the movie.Overall, ""Cast Away"" is a great movie.

This movie holds such a special place in my heart,"Where do I start, I have lost count of the times I have watched this beautiful film. Tom Hanks performance is perfect, but there is more, the overwhelming feeling I am left with at the end of this movie, is that you can overcome anything and what you think you may have lost may not be as good as what you are about to receive. I believe that Helen Hunt's character, came into Chuck's life so that she would simply be his guardian angel through the hell that was the desert island and its isolation, she helped him survive! After his ordeal, he had changed and she had changed, he had become almost worldly and his experience allowed him to become aware of what was really important and what wasn't. She either appeared to have become or perhaps the pure genius of this film made me feel as if she was boring or staid compared to the person Chuck had become. The angel wings on the FedX package, was such a constant throughout the story and I choose to believe that he ends up with the woman at the center of the creation of those wings. The message: people come in and out of our lives for different reasons, we may not know the reason, or we may mourn when they leave or move on, but it is all part of our journey and with a little bit of faith and luck we can all end up where we were supposed to be at journey's end.

The first shot is the best,"You only truly get one shot at experiencing this movie.  The first viewing is important.  It is a very satisfying and intriguing plot that develops slowly and steadily.  You may think this has all been done before, but stand corrected here and now:  what a difference Tom Hanks makes.This is an emotional rollercoaster ride through a series of events, and just when you think you can't cry anymore, along comes Helen Hunt to further reduce you to tears of love lost through no fault other than time.  Absence not only makes the heart grow fonder, but it makes the heart lament the lost time that can never be recovered nor the bridges broken be repaired.The movie has my respect, because I fell in love with an inanimate object; Wilson.  I am not ashamed to admit I cried over Wilson!  I dare anyone to say they didn't feel a tug over that one!  You are lying!  Wilson was an involuntary symbol--I won't embellish further, but a symbol none the less.Tom Hanks reportedly lost quite a bit of weight during the filming of this movie--the whole things was put on hiatus for a long time period to facilitate this feat.  Amazing!  He shines bright in this one, but in my book, Hanks is always shining.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Good Movie but overhyped,"First of all I want to spank to the people that promoted this movie. The preview featured music from Braveheart. Great, but please don't do it again. We all now that James Horner achieved his maximum in Braveheart but that doesnt mean that everybody has to use the music in all previews. Remember, Titanic also used Braveheart's music in the preview. I guess that because the music is so nice they'll get more people to see the movie. Anyway, for a movie that didnt promise too much, a castaway lost in his pacific island for two hours, I have to admit that Cast Away surprised me. I didnt find the movie boring at all because there are a lot of humor in it, and you get along with Tom Hanks role. But besides from that I don't think this movie is by far the best of the year. Its a good movie, but I don't think it could be better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Not at the top of this year's class.,"This movie is worth seeing because of Tom Hanks' stellar performance. However, the movie is nothing special other than that.

review,"I have heard many people call this Fed-ex add, and i have to agree with them. It seen Fed-ex bosses abuse their workers,they have no lives, their jobs consume them, their family life suffers and even then the packages still go out late. Their planes aren't safe , their pilots are poor , and if they do 'loose' a package, they have no problem opening it to see if there is anything useful inside.Very exciting start when the plane went down, laughable to find out that Tom Hanks was able to survive the crash from 25,000 feet. Anyone who works in shipping has to wonder why a package being delivered to Texas would have ever been on a Fed-ex plane going over the South Pacific. It wasn't logical.Last of all,i couls not accept the fact that his girlfriend could turn her back on ""the love of her life"" only one year after he disappeared and married someone else.It actually made me quite angry at the end",2.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

A pure masterpiece!,"How did Tom Hanks do it?First of all, I wanted to say that the emotional quality of this film was impeccable.Chuck Noland is played brilliantly by Tom Hanks, to be honest I believe he brought unmatchable emotion to this film.Well, Wilson is a volleyball who is a great addition to the film. You must be thinking how is a volleyball a important part of a film? I will tell you this now, you have to watch the film to feel what the volleyball brings...Obviously the graphical quality might not be up to the flabbergasting quality it is at today, as the film was made in 2000, though it is fine and shouldn't be discarded for its age.For a film shot a number of years back it still could get a high scoring box office taking. Of course Tom Hanks is a great actor and has starred in numerous films; but being able to talk to a volleyball and mean so much pure emotion is a wow factor for this film.I would definitely recommend this film to anybody who is an adventure movie fan.What a masterpiece of a film!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
WHO thought this was a good movie?,"In the first fifteen minutes, the director asks me to believe (and care about) the absolutely most impossibly ridiculous plane crash/survival sequence in history.

Tom Hanks swims free, unharmed. But there's a jet turbine still menacing on the surface? What? The brain of the plane is dead and sunk. What's spinning this thing? From there, the movie escalates in sheer stupidity. The man risks his life for a basketball. For God's sake.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Does Hank's pull this off?,Before i saw this film i had my own pre concieved ideas of what it would be like. I knew this film was about a guy who get stuck on a deserted island and i wondered how and if they could make this interesting.If anybody could make a film like this work it would be Tom Hanks. Lets face it how many bad film has he made?Does hanks pull it off? I'm not too sure if he does. The film is good but because of the concept of the film it is hard for it not to be a little boring and it is at times. Credit should go to Hank's because he does a De Niro stile Weight Loss to make his stay on the island look realistic but i dont think it is enough. Don't get me wrong Cast Away is not a bad film it just not that exciting.,7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Awesome!!,"If you are feeling lonely and nothing is working for you. This is the movie you should watch. This movie will motivate you not to quit, keep patience and focus on your work, whatever the situation. Directed and produced by Robert Zemeckis, ""Cast Away"" is an American adventure drama film released in 2000. This is a great movie in which Tom Hanks (Chuck Noland) a FedEx employee stranded on an uninhabited island after his plane crashes in the South Pacific. In the film, Wilson the volleyball serves as Chuck Noland's personified friend and only companion during the four years that Noland spends alone on a deserted island.

"Absolutely, positively ho-hum","Greetings again from the darkness.  I feel cheated.  A great actor, first rate director, monster budget, the Dreamworks production team and a tropical island, and all that results is a two and a half hour commercial for FedEx. Is this where our movies are headed?  Tom Hanks should feel cheated too.  He takes a year off to lose weight and grow hair, and he gets to throw a spear and lay on a wooden raft.  Please.  On a positive note, Zemekis does provide us with a wonderfully executed plane crash sequence.  I felt like I was THERE as Hanks struggles for air.  Hanks has developed into a remarkable actor.  In the few scenes with other people, his skills overwhelm every one of them - including Helen Hunt.  Why the need to skip FOUR years?  The cheap stunt to make us feel Hanks' desperation from the previous year could easily have been a remarkable scene in the movie.  My tidbit on this one involves Fred Smith, CEO of FedEx playing himself in one scene.  Was this his price to have his company's brand stamped all over this film?  Or did he receive endorsement funds and have his ego stroked?  Overall, this is a very mediocre movie, that proves with enough money, even mediocrity can be slickly filmed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Some good moments but ultimately goes nowhere,"After the good reception in the US, I looked forward to seeing this film when it opened here in Australia.  In the end, I was disappointed.The first part of the film builds the character of Chuck (Tom Hanks), and shows us his relationship with his girlfriend Kelly (Helen Hunt).  I thought that a lot of the dialogue in this section (especially in the plane before the crash) was poorly timed and delivered, and didn't really contribute much to the story.The crash scene itself is excellent, and the middle section of the movie (on the island) is enjoyable.  The use of an 'imaginary friend' to allow dialogue on the island (and to show the character trying to cope with the loneliness and avoid madness) was novel and effective.However I felt it went downhill when he returned to civilisation.  There were many unanswered questions (why try and tow the raft when he had oars? If the package was so important to his will to live, why leave it unexplored until the end?) and an unsatisfactory examination of the effect of Chucks return on the relationship between him, Kelly, and her new husband.In all I felt it was a fairly average movie, with some missed opportunities and fairly good performance from Tom Hanks.  I'd recommend waiting for it on video.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Huh?,"I was bored on Christmas Day, so I went down the street to see this film.  I had seen an interview between Hanks and Charlie Rose the day before, so my interest was up.  While I can appreciate Hanks' talent as an actor, this film left a lot to be desired.  First of all, the trailer gives way too much of the plot away, including the fact that Chuck is rescued, and he ends seeing Kelly again (the trailer has enough sense not to give away what Kelly did for the time he was gone).  I got that Chuck, being a control freak about time, has to reevaluate when he realizes what little control he has over anything.  I even picked up on the use of the Elvis Presley songs in the movie.  What was the ultimate lesson he was supposed to get overall? The film is very unclear about that, leaving the audience with an ambiguous ending.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Gem of a Movie,"I had great expectations from the movie. And it didn't disappoint. Tom Hanks is way too good. This is one great movie which certainly goes much deeper than the portrayal.

This goes to the topmost shelf of my mind and the most decorated cabinet in my heart. I am watching this many a time. Excellent. I am sure there's a lot in the audience who bought the DVD just in order to watch it over and over again. Well that's quite natural. You are in for a very nice experience. People having complaints about their situation. Just sit and admire this. There's a lot of help on offer.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
the nature oriented film,"i do like this film very much, because it does concentrate mainly on the expected and natural acts that people do in the emergent situations they are put in. For example, Tom Hanks in the film didn't have any tool to burn fire; so, he insisted on using two pieces of wood and touching them strongly together in order to make fire, which at the end had happened after a very big effort of him. This shows us how simple we might find things, which in real had gone a long way of improvement before reaching their last figure and appeal. At the same time i do also like this film very much, because it takes into consideration the human feelings and relations, like when Tom Hanks lost William, you can notice how bad and lonely he felt, as if William was a real personal. What i like also in this film is how Tom Hanks has insisted on getting out of his problem, which is staying on the island, by preparing for making a boat and taking into consideration all the troubles he might face and putting a timing for all what he is doing... All of this shows how human creativity and intelligence can be used in any situation, either a known one before or un unexpected and unknown one.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A Mixed Bag,A good idea but not taken far enough.  The plot is painfully predictable once we realise he's eventually going to be saved.  The most interesting developments were those on the island.

My favorite film of all-time!,"This is definitely one of my favorite films, if not my favorite film of all time! It is really, really underrated! There are so many great things about this movie that I can't possibly explain everything, but I will explain some things on why I love it so much. First, lets start with the acting. Tom Hanks delivers an outstanding performance! Never once is he monotonous or boring. You actually feel his emotion and it is just him on the island. The acting just has so much raw power, it is insane. Also, you better like Tom Hanks, since it is just him on the island, or you probably won't like this movie (but then again, who doesn't like Tom Hanks?) Now, I want to talk about the plot. I'm not going to reveal every detail or anything, but I just want to say that I like survival stories, and this is no exception. There is also a romance aspect to this film that I love, and also like how it isn't just straight-up romance, but it is subtle almost. Also, Robert Zemeckis directed this really well. Also, how is there so much emotion in this film? I felt sad and also started developing feelings for the characters, like Wilson and Chuck. Finally, I want to talk about the amazing cinematography. The amazing camera shots that they use are some of the best that I have ever seen. Also, the island allows for some good cinematography. Beautiful blues, lush greens, bright yellows (from the raft) makes for one of the best color palettes I have seen to date. Really, the cinematography is just breathtaking. Just such great scenery makes this a movie to see on Blu-Ray. No color grading present, just beautiful natural colors. Also, I mentioned camera shots. They really are some of the greatest shots that I have seen. Basically, just watch this movie. You will NOT be disappointed.

"Realistic film, but not ""Lost'","Believe it or not,until last night,I had never seen this movie. I'd seen snippett's of it on The Oscars and other places but I just hadn't seen it. I made one attempt about 2 years ago,checking the movie out of library but the copy had been grossly damaged. Finally though,my brother stopped by with his copy and we watched it. He's seen it several times.My overall impression after watching it was,""Wow,what an amazing story"". The story of a man who has little time for his very understanding wife who obviously loves him like crazy. Who takes off just before Christmas of 1995 on doomed flight that will alter his life forever.The scene of the mayhem that ensues in side of the plane was very well done,as were the scenes of Hanks' character surviving the angry seas. Finally he arrives safely to a deserted island. Where for the next 1500 days his will to live is put to the test.He finds food,makes shelter,works like a caveman to create fire and basically just learns the art of true survival. All the while the only other thing keeping him going is the antique pocket-watch given to him by his wife before he boarded the plane. Her picture in the watch gives him hope that he'll return to her someday soon.After 4 years pass,he's still surviving but his mind has drifted into a state of altered reality. He's taken to painting a face on a soccer ball (with his own blood) and nameing it ""Wilson"",as it says on the ball. ""Wilson"" becomes his best friend.Finally (and quite amazingly) near the end of this,another piece of the plane washes up on shore and he uses it as a sail for a raft he builds. It's actually a credit to Hanks' acting when ""Wilson"" falls overboard into the ocean and floats away,Hanks actually makes us feel his loss for this imaginary friend.Upon being rescued and getting home,he discovers his wife and friends gave up on his return. Se's remarried with children and his friend informs him that they had a funeral and wake for him.His now ex-wife realizes she shouldn't have listened to her friends & family who said she should just ""let him go"". Which gives us a slightly ""hollywood"" scene of her calling to him & chasing after him in the rain as he's driving off. They still love each-other but the damage is done.With the life he knew gone he's now at a complete loss as to what he's supposed to do with it now. The ending really doesn't provide a clear-cut answer but merely hints at it. I can only guess the question to ask by the ending is,""What would I do if all this happened to me""? I give ten stars because the movie is simply that engaging,moving even a bit suspenseful (if you've never seen it. The scenery is breathtaking as well and the whole movie is worth the time to watch.

The premise of this movie may seem generic, but the execution and story direction in the second half are simply great.The film's beautiful cinematography and stirring soundtrack contribute to its emotional depth, while its poignant ending leaves a lasting impression. Despite its runtime of 2 hours and 23 minutes, the film's gripping narrative keeps viewers engaged throughout.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Greatly Enjoyed!,"I was not a Tom Hanks fan when I approached this movie. Probably my favorite of his projects up to this point was 'Bosom Buddies,' and, yes, that includes 'Saving Private Ryan.' I swore and threw stuff at my TV when he won his Oscars. What in hell were people thinking, giving this guy awards for his saccharine, watery-eyed everyman schtick? This kind of acting belonged in ibuprofen commercials.Then I saw 'Cast Away.' I was nervous at first--although the prologue contained nothing overtly vomitous, it was still way too cute for my sensitive palate. Cute, boring guy's cute, boring girlfriend thinks he works too much; he very cutely, very boringly tricks her into thinking he's not going to propose, etc. Again, to the filmmakers' credit, the cute stuff was approached with a pretty subtle hand--but it doesn't take much to make me gag.Then the plane goes down, and the movie turns into something else: part silent film, part philosophical indie, part horror movie. The direction is really quite amazing, especially coming from Robert Zemeckis. Who knew he had it in him, to combine such beautiful cinematography with such powerful imagery (the spear-fishing transition is an incredible movie moment), all in the context of what can only be thought of as an introspective non-story? Who knew that he was so tuned in to the power of silence? Who knew that he, or anyone, could milk honest-to-God tears from a man keeping himself sane through his 'friendship' with a volleyball? There were times when I couldn't believe this thing had played in mainstream theaters, it was so quiet and strange and sad. It had almost none of the usual crowd-pleasing crap, and that was beautiful.And yes, Tom Hanks is good, very good. And I was ready for him to bomb, believe me. I may have even smiled at the idea of him marooned on an island with no food. (Where's your watering eyes now, Buffy?) But he surprised me--his performance was completely subtle, and completely believable, and completely sad. He probably should have gotten the Oscar this time.But of course it couldn't really last, and in the final act the cuteness does creep in again. But it doesn't really matter. You can't take that middle section away from me, and in this case that's enough.Much has been made out of the endless parade of FedEx logos, and you don't have to be a film-school graduate to notice (and laugh at) the over-the-top mise-en-scene. But who really cares about that? All in all, the beginning and ending make my grade something of a compromise, but I definitely recommend checking this one out. 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
I'm raising my vote to 10/10,"I have commented on Cast Away before, so, if you actually want to see my opinion about this film's content, see my previous comment. Right here, after the third time I've seen the film, I just have to say this: not for at least the past twenty years has a more emotionally and artistically satisfying motion picture been made in Hollywood. If I should ever meet Tom Hanks or any of the other artists involved in making this film, I would just have to hug them.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Powerful !!!!!!!!,"This film has so many key messages such as to take everything for granted in your life its so powerful The package the key iconography of the film symbolise Chucks hope and keeps him going i think there is a message on it and the wings symbol also gives chuck hope The final scene is the best scene for me where he stands at the crossroads the lady who symbolise the package giving him hope giving him directions it all relates to when he was stranded, in fact the package has just been delivered to her house so this is easy to spot But the whole point of this film is to hit the ignorant people in this world, people tend to forget that they are lucky to have what they have and it just conveys so many messages and it has a big effect on the audience. I think the film is highly underrated in every sense 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Worst Piece of Hollywood Crap,"This is by far the WORST film I have ever seen.  I have to admit, it went from bad to worse.  I nearly shut the film off once Hanks' character got blood on a soccer ball and then named it Wilson.  From that point on I was just so lucky to experience Hanks talking to and having quite emotional arguments with ""Wilson""...interesting.  This was just a lame movie.  It took everything I had to finish watching it, and when I was done my eyes hurt from rolling them so much.  I can't believe Hanks' still has a career after this horrible film!!",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The Shortest 2+ Hour Movie Ever?,"At first glance, a shipwrecked Tom Hanks growing a beard didn't sound very appealing to me.  Thus, I was pleasantly surprised at the end of the movie. Tom Hanks is terrific in this role, as his depression and descent to near madness as he loses hope of escape is very empathic.  Interestingly enough, however, I found the time on the island, although the core of the movie, to be very short for what is supposed to be 4 years time.  This is a small complaint, however, and Tom Hanks' triumph of human spirit will make anyone's day.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Still entertaining after 14 years,"This is the kind of Hollywood movie I really like. I've seen it three times now, and after 14 years it is still hugely entertaining.Hanks is fantastic here. This role was perfect for him, and he really gives it his all.I suppose it's because I enjoy all castaway films; however, this is a particularly good one. Who hasn't dreamed of giving it all up and spending a long period on an island like this? To me, this movie is pure escapism. Unlike Chuck Noland, I'm sure I wouldn't need a Wilson.The main star in this movie is not Hanks, but the island of Monuriki, Fiji. I really wonder whether there is any island like this left in the world anymore.Has anyone been truly lost on a deserted island in recent years? Most castaways seem to be voluntary nowadays. Is something like this even possible in modern times? And aren't most beaches in the Pacific covered in garbage? We've already ruined it all, haven't we?I suppose I could have done without the FedEx promotion. However, this didn't ruin the film for me.I suppose it's all a metaphor for a harsh, uncaring universe. Sh*t happens, and when it does you have to get off your a*s, stop blaming the world, and make the best of it.This movie could not have gone wrong with Zemeckis at the helm, Broyles as the writer, and Hanks in the main role. Kudos to them all for this great movie. It's worth about 8.5. I can't decide whether to give an 8 or 9, but for now I'll round it up. I think of this as one of my favourite movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Survivor on big screen....,"Oh boy are survivor fans happy?

Cast Away — A lone survivor on a deserted island in the middle of the Pacific,"Cast Away shows you what life would be for a lucky shipwreck or plane crash survivor on a deserted island in the Pacific. It's tough, and very lonely.The movie does an excellent job of showing us that, and also of setting up the character's life, and what would happen after he returns home. It is a drama, but it's not something designed to upset the viewer. Everything is done right: the editing, the soundtrack, the camera shots, the sets, the costumes, the accessories, the scenario, the dialogs, and the story.Tom Hanks is perfect, a high note in his career, without a doubt. He brings excellent dramatic emotions to the screen, as well as incredible poise in the loneliness of his character and his defeated look, not to mention going to incredible dietary length to get really emaciated.The only negative things I've found, are not that noticeable. First, the Christmas family dinner is a bit over done in true Hollywood fashion. Second, the ""sea"" during the crash is obviously set in a large artificial basin and the huge waves are CG. Third, the night time scenes on the island don't look real.That being said, it's a must see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The Ultimate Survivor,"Although ""Cast Away"" is effectively a 143 minute commercial for Fed Ex, it is nonetheless a good movie. In the midst of the many ""reality based"" TV shows, Director Robert Zemeckis and star Tom Hanks give us a feeling of what it would really be like to have to survive in the wilderness.Hanks plays Chuck Noland a troubleshooter for Fed Ex whose plane goes down somewhere over the Pacific Ocean during a raging storm. He somehow survives and washes up on the beach of a deserted island. He is forced to learn how to survive by using the materials and resources that are available to him in this wilderness.Zemeckis and Hanks through his stunning performance, are able to convey the loneliness and isolation of an everyman in a seemingly hopeless situation. We see the Hanks character grow his hair and beard, lose weight (which he actually did for the film) and form a touching ""friendship"" with a volleyball onto which he has drawn a face and calls ""Wilson"", to keep from going mad. He also longs for the girl he left behind (Helen Hunt) by constantly looking at a picture of her in the watch that she had given him.Hanks is outstanding in the lead role and Hunt does what she can in a limited role. Watch for Chris Noth in small part.I thought the producers went a little too far though in their Fed-Ex tie-in. I mean, we see Fed-Ex trucks and packages all through the picture and yes, even on the desert island. Oh my god, I think they got me too. How many times have I mentioned ""Fed-Ex"" in MY comments?",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Great human drama!,"Tom Hanks plays a FedEx executive that survives a plane crash in the ocean and drifts upon an uninhabited island. He is finally given up for dead as he spends more than four years on the island. There are some  moments of humor mixed with the sullen sadness of solitude. The human spirit is fortified by positive attitude and determination.Hanks, being the skilled actor he is, makes you feel his pain and sense of fulfillment. Mother nature fills the bill as special effects. This is a wonderful movie to watch. Another masterpiece for director Robert Zemeckis.Also starring are Helen Hunt, Lari White, Nick Searcy and Christopher Noth.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Thinly veiled commercial for Federal Express?,"I saw this movie for the first time last night on network TV. For a ""guy-alone-on-desert-island (or planet)"" movie, it's no better than fair.  I agree with those who give 1964's ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars"" a better score. But the thing that makes this flick so flaky and unbelievable is that it appears to be a dual production, i.e. a movie AND a commercial for the package delivery company continually being shoved into our faces during the film.

Good but ....,"Entertaining movie if you can accept waterlogged packages with dry contents (ink on cards doesn't even smear), no ill effects from being pulled under water then surfacing rapidly (any SCUBA divers in the crowd?), and a current that pulls his raft one way and his ""friend"" another.

Wouldn't watch it again,"Tom Hanks has to be one of the best actors out there.I watched this movie because they made fun on it on Family Guy and I wanted to understand the joke. I felt like this movie relied on the beginning which was not to good... at all. The movie skipped time which left a gap in the plot and the realism of it. There was no standout acting performance. Well except Tom Hanks. I don't feel like this movie is what everybody is trying to make it, it is what it is.I felt no realism in it (i can't do an a example without spoiling anything).

Gilligan's Island it is not.,"Cast Away has to be the most boring, uninspired movie of 2000. Going into the film (from the previews) I knew that Tom Hanks was going to be involved in a plane crash and stranded on a deserted island. And seeing that Helen Hunt was the supporting star/billing ho, it was pretty obvious that he'd be back to his Memphis home town (where seemingly, a'la Kevin Costner's Robin Hood, everyone has a southern accent except Hanks).So what happens between that time? Everything you'd expect. He aims to survive. Food, clothing, shelter, Fed Ex shipments... But there is no tension, no drama, no suspense, and despite what Hollywood is hyping as some 20 minutes of gripping silence, there is no good acting. So you end up not caring, and it doesn't get much worse when you don't care what happens to the star of the show.I felt sorry for Gilligan, he was too inept to rescue himself. But I won't feel sorry for Tom Hanks. Especially if he makes ""Cast Away II.... And the Harlem Globetrotters.""",2.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Tom Hanks Classic,"A classic and iconic film which delivers exactly what you might expect. Hanks' performance is perfect over the longitudinal plot, varying in accordance with the circumstances. Having a solitary character interact with just his surroundings is a little limiting, but the context and backstory is enough to push everything along. It is a long film, and the tying up of all the loose ends towards the finish can drag a little, but really there is a reason why Cast Away is so famous. Not many films can get you to care for a volleyball.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"A fantastic film, steeped in realism, with an emotional core","There is a lot of praise given to Tom Hanks for his performance in Cast Away, and that is absolutely earned. However, you've also got to give credit to the director, Robert Zemeckis, and the writer, William Broyles, for creating a story with a single actor, an isolated setting, and very little dialogue that is so compelling.

A Three Act Play Where One Act Would Have Sufficed,"There is one positive in this movie: It solidifies Tom Hanks as not only one of America's most beloved actors, but also one of the best.  There is a sequence in the middle of the movie where Hanks begins to figure out exactly how far away from everyone and how large the search area for his crash is that is simply heartbreaking.  Hanks stunning acting on the island, however, is muted by the opening where he is surrounded by cardboard cutouts of stock characters, the brilliant island footage, and then he returns right back into cardboard cutouts and forced situations.

I'd forgotten that this is ultimately a love story, had forgotten the despair, the giving up, the suicide attempt, mostly just remembered Wilson and Fire!Tom Hanks is brilliant in his one man show of survival as airfreight executive Chuck Noland, a man who lives by the clock until his plane crashes and he washes ashore on a deserted island in the Pacific. For more than 4 years he struggles to stay alive sustained only by the companionship of a volley ball he names Wilson.I still I had to question how easily Tom excepts that he is alone on a desert island, I lived in the Caribbean, some islands are very desolate in parts, he might have at least walked around the bay, there could have been a Hyatt Regency or a road or a cruise ship dock but no he just hunkers down on the beach.

Great Movie but. . .,"It really seem like one big ad for Federal Express. I think it would have been better if there was a fake company Hanks' character worked for.

Wilson!!!!!!!,"Magnificent Robinson Crusoe adventure vehicle that is unfortunately sandwiched between a vapid love story. I realize that the movie would probably not work without the home elements, but they are just way too long and way too ordinary.

That part, the best part flies by way too quickly. But what can you do? It's still very watchable, and the good part is it's the perfect pay channel movie. Why? Odds are you'll be flipping through the channels and happen upon this en medias res, which means you'll have skipped at least part of the boring beginning and if your lucky jump right in during the incredible plane crash sequence.

Not as fun as......,"When you think of being stranded, stuck on a tropical island, what do you think of?  Of course, Gilligan!   We are forever stuck with the hilarious memories of Gilligan and the gang from childhood (if not even today with the eternal reruns).  If you were lucky, you may even remember the time the gang got off the island and returned to civilization.  The rescue was hilarious, Gilligan tried to make a barbeque on the raft.  The fire and smoke attracted a boat and Wham, they're saved.  After returning home, none could properly adjust back to their normal lives, personal, social, and career.  Perhaps that 's my bias with Cast Away, this movie is totally stuck on Tom Hanks the ""survivor"" than Chuck the person.I know Hanks did a supurb job acting.  Robert Z did a great job directing, the supporting cast did a supurb job supporting, blah , blah, blah.  But what credibility and imagination did this movie feature?  What insight and introspective to the human psyche?  I'd like to make one up, but find myself scratching my head thinking, well at least he survived and he'll ""keep breathing"" (or whatever he said).  Gee, what a shocker, why don't Helen Hunt marry an alcoholic and then we'll see what ""keep breathing"" really means. I mean, she lives in a nice flat with a chance to get a doctorate...that's not ""keep breathing"", it's ""I'm happily married to YOUR dentist!!""Dealing with adversity is one thing, acting as if it's just an obstacle is another.

Good Effort,"A brief scan over the premise of this movie brings of concern.  Can one man really be entertaining for all that time?  How interesting can four years on an island be?However, I was pleasently surprised, but not overly.  Tom Hanks manages to keep your attention, his subtle but significant characted journey is absorbing.  The various tasks he must carry out to stay alive are interesting - perhaps only academically and not dramtically.  A sense of humour prods the story along.The direction, for me, is what saves the movie however.  Instead of the bright colours of a dream like island, we see shades, pastels.  Infact the island is rather grim.  Time is used wonderfully, from the fast paced world to the timelessness and lonelyness are expertly portrayed.  Silence, black screens, both forgotten devices are used to great effect here.  Even the 'four years later' although perhaps cliche, perhaps a little lazy, gives the feeling of nothingness that helps us to feel his isolation.Although a little too long, perhaps not a master piece, this film has a great deal to offer in its details.

In fact, this isn't even an island; it's a big rock.Now I know that 90% of the audience expected some action on this island. You know maybe a huge bear, or a lion, or a tiger attacking Tom Hanks. Well as I said, it was a rock.'Cast Away' is a move about a man staying alone on a rock for four year, helpless. So if you strip man from all the technology and society what do you have? Can this creature survive and exceed its limitations?Zemeckis did a tremendous job, so did Hanks. The environment is suffocating and beautiful at the same time. Tom Hanks succeeds at making this character believable. You can feel the struggle inside, trying to stay sane with no one else to talk to.This is a triumph of man and a lyrical projection of the power within.Best movie of 2000.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Wilson!,"Cast Away is a movie about a man who is going on a business trip, when a storm storm crashes his plane. He make his way to a remote island by holding onto wreckage, and he wakes up to realize his lonely state.Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) is in no way prepared for the task of surviving out in the wild. Chuck realizes that it doesn't really matter how prepared he is, because he is now in a situation where he either learns quick, or he dies. We see him go from white-collar business man to shirtless survivor man.Chuck is desperately trying to survive, and get rescued from this island so he can get home to his lover. He will stop at nothing to get home to her, and for her company that he so desperately desires. His loneliness almost leads to his insanity (which Hanks manages to make very comical actually).I really believe that Tom Hanks is one of only a very few actors in the world who could have pulled this role off so brilliantly. For about 98% of the movie, Hanks is the only actor on screen, but it wouldn't really matter if there were other actors present anyway. Hank's performance is so great that all the viewer's focus would be on him regardless.Cast Away is a movie about a man trying to live, and dealing with the loneliness of living on an island by himself. Tom Hanks at the top of his game. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Champion of the Human Spirit!,"It is just one of those movies that has it all. I can watch it once or twice a year. It gives me strength.

"Good, but not as amazing as Forrest Gump.","First of all, Tom Hanks is an incredible actor. He exemplifies every movie that he is in, and he has always been one of my favorite actors. Forrest Gump is one of mine & my sisters favorite movies. I expected this to be as good, but I was a little disappointed. Helen Hunt is completely useless in this movie, and her and Hanks have no chemistry at all, so you don't care about their relationship. But Hanks does great on his own. The island scenes are wonderful, and he develops a funny and touching friendship with Wilson, a volleyball. All in all, it is good, but I don't think it will take home a lot of Oscars. Zemeckis and Hanks are great, but before and after the island come up dry. 8/10.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The good side of mediocre,"In contrast to most people I found the quality even and unremarkable throughout.  Would someone explain to me, for instance, what was so great about the plane crash?  Yes, the moment when the cabin de-pressurises comes as a real jolt, but shock tactics are easy.  It's like the moment in horror movies when a skeleton hand suddenly shoots up out of a grave.  It's startling, not frightening.  All in all the crash/storm sequence is humdrum and badly shot.  What was the point of those intermittent blackouts? They're irritating; besides, Zemeckis has it backwards: a storm isn't light punctuated by darkness, it's darkness punctuated by light.  If anything the plane crash was a low point.That's the movie as a whole: decent but lacking, marred by poor craft throughout.  Among the questionable decisions: computer generated whales (straight out of ""Fantasia 2000""), FedEx (they could so easily have used a made up brand name), and too much editing on the island.  The last really destroyed our sense of the passage of time, and with it any idea we may have had of how well the Tom Hanks character was faring.  How long did he go before finding enough water to live on?  I don't know, but I suspect it's longer than Zemeckis tried to lead us to believe, with his frequent cuts. All the small sequences before the `four years later' caption (itself a cop-out), good though they may have been individually, collectively come across as mere montage rather than a sustained assault on the problem of survival.-On the other hand, what was so bad about the third act?  ""Cast Away"" is at heart a gently optimistic story of survival: its message is that mere survival - MERE survival - isn't really so bad as all that when you get to know it.  Some people wanted Tom Hanks to feel utterly bleak, to fall to pieces, when confronted with civilisation again.  Why would he?  Living in a city again after four years would be like re-adopting a half-forgotten habit - riding a bicycle for the first time in a decade.  The truth is, there's nothing much to say about what happens when he rejoins the larger world.  I found the concluding section the most honest part of the film, if a little aimless.All in all, not bad.  I remember a reviewer writing that the Oscar Zemeckis won for ""Forrest Gump"" would destroy him as an artist.  I remember thinking at the time: ""Well, how could it not?  He's just been rewarded for creating something terrible.""  And, it must be noted, ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" was Zemeckis's only masterpiece.  But it was also an unrepeatable accident.  The kind of zaniness it exemplifies so easily turns sour in his hands (as in ""Death Becomes Her"" or the entire Back to the Future trilogy); on the other hand, if he keeps plugging away in an attempt to create something grand, he may one day succeed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
An absolute classic.,"One of my favorite movies and probably my favorite Tom Hanks performance.It was genius of Zemeckis to not use a musical score during the scenes on the island. It adds to the immersion and that feeling of being present on this island with Chuck. There is something extremely reflective and meditative about Cast Away that I haven't quite seen in another film. Ultimately this movie can lead you to questions about your own life and I cannot commend a movie enough for provoking these types of thoughts.One of the most emotional movies of all time. Incredible themes as well.""Tomorrow the sun will rise. Who knows what the tide could bring.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Less action than expected, but a great story...","Cast Away is an interesting story that forces us to think.  There are many great shots and nicely crafted scenes in Cast Away, but what I think distinguishes it from most movies today is its willingness to show us a story rather than tell us what we should think and feel.  Although I would have liked to hear more of Hanks' own thought process, we're forced to look inward and see how Hanks' character parallels our life.  Following the movie we are forced to reflect how we would act if we were on the Island, what we would do if our only true love was lost for years only to reappear, and how relationships lived inside our heads are often perfect but rarely play out in reality.  These all happen here and Zemekis wisely enough doesn't show us how they should be resolved, but simply what happens to Hanks' character and how an everyday man copes with extraordinary circumstances both on and off a deserted island.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Cast away,"I have never seen a more meaningful and thought-provoking film.

It made me think about all my creature comforts, and what is actually necessary in life. Talking to a volleyball has never been more dramatic! I also loved the fact that there was little talking in the film, maybe that was because i was staying in a hotel in France with french TV, but anyway, it sort of made you guess how he was feeling, in a clever way.

GREAT PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE OCEAN!,"Recently viewed this film and was amazed at the great photography and how beautiful the Island was, Monuriki, Fiji; the beautiful waves and terrifying heights in which the waves towered over poor Tom Hanks (Chuck Nolan),""Catch Me If You Can"",'02, who played an outstanding role as a man stranded on a lonely island except for a ball with a face painted on it with his own blood!  This film started out in a nowhere place and kept your interest to the very end with travels to Russia and remote areas unknown. Helen Hunt(Kelly Frears),""What Women Want"",2000, played a very brief role but important and her acting with Chuck Nolan was very dramatic and drew lots of tears.  Kelly gave Chuck her grandfather's watch from his days working for the Southern Pacific Railroad with her picture and it appeared quite often in the film.

The real SURVIVOR!,"You know, it would be refreshing to see Tom Hanks take acouple of years off from movies and do some stage work.  He could undeniablyget away with it.  He IS 'Cast Away'.  There is no other performer in thisfilm who even holds a candle to him.  To work for the better half of thisfilm stranded on a desert island, Hanks thoroughly convinced me that he WASstuck on this island and I had to remind myself from time to time that itwas only a movie.  Director Robert Zemeckis stages one of the most realisticplane crashes I have ever seen and the stillness which fills the last frameof the movie with a crossroads as its focus is perfectly executed.  My onlycomplaint is that, as much as I enjoyed Hanks alone on the island, I wouldhave enjoyed periodic flashbacks of his life while stuck alone to develophis character better to show him more dimensionally and not just as asurvivor and this probably would have propelled the film into my top five.Oh, well, at least there was Wilson.   : - )",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Dramatic Story,"I liked ""Cast Away"" because it takes you far away from our rush hour time. On the other side we assist a well developed dramatic story with full of adventures.

Bad ending ruined this movie,"This movie had the potential to be a truly great film; however, I felt the ending was so bad that it completely ruined the film for me.  It was clear to me neither the director nor the writer knew what they wanted to do with the protagonist when he gets home.  Despite the fact that (plot revelation coming)Chuck makes it home, this film seems almost completely void of hope and happiness. The audience not even rewarded with the recipient receiving the package.Much of this film is amazing.  The plane crash is incredible, and watching Chuck struggle to stay alive is incredible as well.  Tom Hanks, once again reminds everyone in Hollywood that he is at the top of his profession.It probably would have been better ending with Chuck (Hanks) being rescued, rather than him standing at some a literal and metaphoric crossroads.

Much better than I originally thought.,I never really enjoyed this movie when it first came out but after watching it again over 10 years later I have found a new appreciation for it. I think initially I was too young to appreciate a film that consists of one man and a desert island for an entire 2 hrs. After I overcame this initial view I discovered that Cast Away is actually a really good movie. Tom Hanks truly is one of the best actors out there.

This film was good because it really touched me.,"My idea of a good film is one that makes me think about it a long time after I've seen it.

As soon as I saw it I wanted to run home and call my boyfriend and tell him how much I love him because as Chuck found out, you never know how much time you'll have.

Definitely worth a couple viewings.,"I'll be honest, the first time I saw this film, I wasn't too sure if I liked it. I mean, I certainly enjoyed it, but I just wasn't too sure of how I felt about the film as a whole. I must say that this film was MUCH better the second time around. And just got better with each additional viewing. I am a huge Robert Zemeckis fan, so maybe my expectations were slightly skewed at first. But, all in all, I've watched the film enough times now that I can say ""I love this film!!!""When I really stop and think about it, the film is brilliantly executed. The scenery is absolutely breath taking, the special effects are so well done that you don't even realize that there are special effects present. This seems to be a trademark of Robert Zemeckis (case and point, ""Forrest Gump""). The acting is very good, although, there's only 2 real sources of acting in this film, Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt. The rest of the cast was good, but their roles were very minor. Tom Hanks pulls off another great performance, as usual. You really can feel all of his emotions while he's stuck on the island. Also, not many actors have changed their physical appearance like Tom Hanks did for this film, I truly applaud him for his work. As much as I liked Russell Crow in ""Gladiator"", I firmly believe that Tom Hanks deserved it more (although that would be his third Oscar). Helen Hunt also pulls off a very nice performance. There is also a good deal of comedy in the film, and it is done very well.This is one of the few films that I strongly recommend you watch. There aren't a great many films that I would say this, but this one I would. Although...if you aren't a fan of Tom Hanks, then you might have some trouble with this film because a great deal of the film is him alone on an island. So, if that is the case, then you are off the hook. So, I hope you watch the film, and I hope that you enjoy it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Quietly Compelling,"How many actors would you pay to watch alone on screen for nearly an hour and a half? Casting Tom Hanks in Cast Away is a no-brainer.  Not many other working actors could carry this film or even Tom Hanks' loincloth.  Director Robert Zemeckis won the first battle just getting Hanks to star.  He won another battle getting Fed Ex to agree to be featured in the greatest product placement since ET's Reese's Pieces. Tom Hanks plays Chuck Noland, an executive with Fed Ex, who flies from meeting to meeting on the company's cargo jets.  He has to survive one of those plane's crashing and learn to thrive on a deserted island in the south Pacific. I have to admit, I was thinking about the TV show Survivor as he struggled to catch food and make fire.  But, sadly for Chuck (Hanks), there were no reward challenges to provide him with the occasional call home or water proof matches. Cast Away is such an appropriate title for this film, because not only is Chuck a castaway, but for Hanks, the rest of the Cast is Away.  Most people feel Tom Hanks is a talented actor, but also an interesting person, I think, someone we'd like, if we hung with the Hollywood crowd.  And, whether that was Chuck Noland out there on the island or Hanks, I didn't get bored watching him get acclimated to his lonely life, because I cared about him. One of my younger co-workers says he was bothered by the fact that there was no soundtrack and the quiet of many of the island scenes.  I would hate to generalize by age group, but the silence didn't disturb me at all.  I didn't even notice it until later in the film when I thought, `Hey, they should have some big building orchestrated music here!'  I think the lack of background noise was perfect for the movie.  All you can hear most times is the relentless crashing of the waves on the beach and reef, and that's a terrific scene setter. Mostly, I love Cast Away for what was left out of the film.  There are some major questions left unanswered when the credits roll.  That's so cool! Studios seem to want everything tied up in a neat package at the end of movies.  Could Cast Away be the start of some novel trend?  Let's hope so. Cast Away is rated PG-13 for intense action sequences and some disturbing images, including the death of a toy. Cast Away earns three and a half stars, on my scale 0-5.  Bottom line, if you like Tom Hanks, you'll like this movie.  And, if you too live and die by time, be sure you've got two hours and 23 minutes to enjoy him.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

A good movie but...,"I agree with many of the other comments that the product placement in the movie was a little hard to take and detracted from the movie. In many ways they hurt the film's artistic integrity and credibility as a serious drama. How can you take the film seriously when it so blatantly resembles a FedEx propaganda film. Were these real Hollywood writers who wrote this movie? Is anyone totally certain that the writers weren't actually marketing executives from Federal Express? My belief is that the writer was a real Hollywood writer who happens to hold real shares of Federal Express.To sum it up, Cast Away, a good movie with good acting and a good story, is nearly ruined by the fact that it plays like a long commercial for Federal Express.

Tom Hanks refreshingly out of his comfort zone,"This movie is a refreshing and successful representation of isolated life and survival. Well written, and directed exceptionally.

As for the acting, Hanks is brilliant and clearly breaks free of his stereotypical extroverted, anxious character. Very good emotional depiction considering the fact that for long stretches in the movie he has no lines to work with whatsoever.

A movie that chooses the road of superficiality,"I was very disappointed in this movie. I expected a decent look into the challenges of living in utter isolation, having to survive without modern acoutrements, and a lot of reflection on one's place in the universe. Oh no. This film, whenever confronted with the option, chooses the road of superficiality over depth.Once we get past the deeply Republican yuppie fantasy of ""ideal existence"" and onto the island, we would expect, at least after a while, a little reflection on the part of our protagonist. But, for a film whose star is so eager to declare that ""nothing happens"" in its middle section, we are treated to unending survival tips and adventures at the expense of any reflection. This is a beautiful island, surely anyone there would have some moments of appreciating the stillness and natural wonder of the island. Well, not here. Surely after four years Hanks would have developed his own ways, his own joys and sorrows, new abilities he's proud of, or good at, but we just don't see them. His emotional range remains, for the whole of the island portion of the film, sad and sadder. We're supposed to believe that after he returns to civilization that there's a part of him left on that island-- well, based on this movie, he never really seems to BE on the island, he's always a yuppie visitor, and doesn't seem to engage in his environment. This movie could have been much more powerful if it chose to really engage in the loneliness and despair that one would feel after giving up on civilization and realizing one may be alone for the rest of one's life. Hanks is a fine actor unhampered by vanity, but here what we're seeing is a movie star dropped off on a set every morning. The movie's depth never rises above the level of ""Dude, what if you were like, trapped on an island? Man, like, what would you DO? That would sure suck."" And that's the one statement this film seems to make: being alone in the universe pretty much sucks. Hey, Thanks Tom, you're giving us pearls.There are a lot of other details that give the film away as a sham. If I was standed on a tropical island, the first thing I would do is look for the resort on the other side. Tom shouts a few ""Hello's,"" then assumes that there's no one there. At one point he climbs up to the summit--at this point a 360-degree pan could have worked wonders, but uh-uh, not here. I still think there's a Club Med a half-mile away that Tom just never bothered to look for. He also never really seems to explore the island--and after four years, don't you think you'd take a little field trip? Also, after four years, wouldn't you have built yourself more than a few spears? Tom can't get off the island because of the reef off the section of beach he refuses to leave--maybe he could have paddled around to see if there was a break in the reef? Oh, I guess not. This is what I mean when I say this film never really engages with the reality of being on the island, and robs itself of the seriousness it so desperately asks of its audience.I have read a book of true accounts of people stranded on islands (""Great Shipwrecks and Castaways,"" it's still in print, and it's excellent, so look for it if this interests you), and a book on how to survive if you must drift for days on a raft, and I know that the real problem Tom is going to face once his portasan blows away is exposure to the sun. But that problem is apparently not convenient for this film to explore, so it just pretends like it doesn't exist. This film asks you to reflect only on the problems of nature that Hollywood can easily solve, all others simply do not exist.A SPOILER IN THIS NEXT SECTION: But the real mistake this movie makes, in which it betrays both itself and its audience, is to virtually cancel out ALL emotional resonance it might have attained by having a hot babe appear out of nowhere in the final two minutes to make everything okay. This development is at once disappointing and disgusting. Disappointing in that all the sadness we've built up for Hanks is INSTANTLY ERADICATED by the convenient appearance of a new ""chick"" to make his life complete, disgusting in the suggestion that Helen Hunt's character, who we've built up such a respect and reverence for, can simply be replaced by an almost identical ""hot chick"" (this one has RED hair though! And besides, Hunt never amounted to much anyway). So, as an audience, we are left to assume that Hank's character really IS stupifyingly superficial, and that the only connection he really had to Hunt, all that time on the island, is that he needed some babe in his life. Hunt, or someone else, it doesn't matter. This puts a nasty taste in my mouth now when I think about Hanks and Zemeckis as PEOPLE. But aside from that, I am surprised that they would so completely betray the film they've obviously expended so much effort on.All in all, a deeply Republican film. It prods us to look deep inside ourselves and ask: ""What would we do if one day we didn't have an SUV and a pager?"" But, the movie says, don't worry about not having a woman around, they're a dime a dozen, and they're all the same.Bleech!--- Check out website devoted to bad and cheesy movies: www.cinemademerde.com",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Cast Away plot and theme,"Cast Away was released in 2000. Some are the main characters are Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt), and Ramon (Paul Sanchez). This film mainly revolves around the main character, Chuck, who gets stranded on an island after his plane crashes into the ocean. This film shows how he tries to survive on this island and try to get himself rescued. The film shows how hard it can truly be to try to survive and the emotional toll it would have one someone. Of course you have to watch the film to figure out whether Chuck survives this situation or not.The theme of Cast Away is pretty straight forward. It is one that shows human survival when we are forced to try and survive or die. This theme focuses on the idea of the struggle for human dignity. Chuck is put in a position of disadvantage and dealt a bad hand when he gets stranded on the island. He is fighting against tremendous odds for his survival. There are also several other films that have a similar theme to Cast Away's theme. 127 Hours is one film that has a similar theme to Cast Away's theme. The main character gets dealt a bad hand when getting stuck in the canyons with his arm crushed and stuck. His is at a disadvantage and fighting against tremendous odds for his survival just like Chuck was in Cast Away.There are a couple of film techniques that have relevance to the film's theme. One technique is lighting. There is a darker lighting during most of the movie, which helps show the significance of the theme. If the lighting was bright during the whole film, then it would be harder to portray the significance of this theme. Sunny and bright usually means happiness. You wouldn't want the audience to feel OK and happy during the movie, you want them to feel sad, nervous, anxiety, fearful at times. This way the audience can have a feeling of being there and have a sense of reality of what is going on in the film and about the theme.The second technique is camera angle. The camera angles changes from the viewer seeing Chuck and his surroundings to seeing what Chuck is seeing, like they are looking through his eyes. Interchanging between these camera angles really gets the audience in tune with Chuck and what he is possibly feeling. Getting the audience involved like this really helps get the theme of this movie across to the viewers. This makes the theme very straight forward. A theme of survival against all odds is a great theme that most audience members enjoy and it works great for Cast Away.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"A modern version of ""Enoch Arden"" focused on the man's lonely survival","There's a good story behind the making of ""Cast Away,"" that took six years from its initial idea, to locations, to a full year of filming with specific breaks, and then final production. Tom Hanks, who stars as Chuck Noland, had the initial idea for the film. He then collaborated with Bill Boyles and Bob Zemeckis for parts of the story. Boyles did the screenplay and Zemeckis directed the movie. For all of that, this is a unique film in how it came about - something quite out of the ordinary way of books, plays, tales or published stories making it onto film.The core of this movie is one man's survival on an island for four years. The filming of that, Hanks' portrayal, and all aspects of this part are superb. But, the last part, after Noland's rescue at sea, is melodrama. To some extent, it can't help but be that. And this is the part that clearly marks this film as a modern adaptation of ""Enoch Arden."" There's no information readily available that makes the connection. But one has to think that Tom Hanks or any one of the other moviemakers had known about the early films based on Alfred Lord Tennyson's poem of that title. Surely, they at least must have seen one or more of the 1940 films that starred Cary Grant, Fred MacMurray, Melvyn Douglas, Irene Dunne, and Jean Arthur; or the 1963 movie that starred Doris Day, James Garner and Polly Bergen.I think the last portion of the film - after Noland's rescue, takes the punch out of the film - of the one man's struggle for survival. In ""Enoch Arden,"" there wasn't great publicity about a lost person being found and rescued. So, he could return to home anonymously after 10 years and see how his wife and family had moved on. Then, out of love for them and their well-being, he chose to go away and remain the man lost at sea and presumed dead. That was a great ending for that poem and film. But it wasn't possible for this film with the extensive news industry that looks for spectacular stories of any kind. So, everyone learns about Noland's survival and rescue. When he returns home, he meets his former lover and her husband, and sees her at home with her child. Initially he was outraged that she was married, but after realizing he can't break up her family, he moves on and the film presents an ending that is passable.What might have lifted this movie to the realm of great and memorable films would have been a different, original idea for the opening and ending in which to box the survival story. The FedEx aspect is fine, but the personal life of the lead needed to be changed. Then, the ending could be diverted from melodrama to something either uplifting or tied right back to the heroe's survival of the island.Hanks is very good in his role, and the filming and production qualities are all very good. Perhaps Fox didn't want to make the connection to ""Enoch Arden"" because the film can't deliver on that film's impact, and it can't be another comedy version.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Just Alright.,"I was very excited to see this movie.  I cursed people at BlockBuster for getting the last copy, and I harassed the clerks there by phone and in person.  I expected an amazing movie, one which would leave me satisfied and content.  And while I didn't hate this movie, I was left very disappointed, and not at all content.This movie was a Tom Hanks movie.  And, I don't mean he was the leading man, I mean, if you don't like Tom Hanks (my boyfriend doesn't), don't see this movie.Tom Hanks is an amazing actor, and he shows it in this film.  A very many scenes took place without dialogue, and he carries it off by displaying his feelings in facial expression and body language.  This part of the film impressed me greatly.  However, the plotline once Hanks is saved from the island really left something to be desired.  Without giving too much away, I will say that the story seemed to become very tense and not at all what most of the viewers I've spoken to wanted from it.  A movie of this magnitude should carry with it a great ending.  An ending which makes the whole of the movie make sense, and injects the whole project with meaning and resolve. Instead, I felt the ending to this was weak.  I kept saying to myself, ""Don't fade to black, don't fade to black"".  It faded to black.I just think it could have been done better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A Remarkable Adventure,"This is the ultimate Robert Zemeckis film. A man, alone with a problem that he needs to solve, a handful of tools at his disposal, all of which he uses, and long takes. This is the movie that he was born to make, and it's the movie he had been building up to with decades of experience. Young Zemeckis could not have pulled off the quiet of Tom Hanks' life on a deserted island like this.Chuck is a FedEx employee who helps set up and fix foreign branches of the company. He starts in Moscow, establishing an office and talking endlessly about how Time is the ultimate enemy. He lives his life by the clock. The clock on the wall in the Moscow office is what that office is to operate by. He's constantly referencing the time and how long it will take to do things. He has a fiancée, Kelly, in Memphis, Tennessee that he loves and tries to see as much as possible, but his work just keeps pulling him away. On Christmas Eve, Chuck gets a message that something needs fixing in Asia, so he jumps on a plane after a nice goodbye with Kelly that includes a potential engagement ring in a wrapped package, and the cast away begins.Robert Zemeckis is an incredibly talented and technical minded director, so the idea that the crash sequence would be good is kind of baked into the cake of Cast Away. However, this crash sequence is amazing and might be the single best sequence Zemeckis ever put together. The build up around the jostle that wakes Chuck up, the storm outside, the quick look at a screen showing them off course, the increased turbulence, the sudden explosion, the loss of cabin pressure, the crash, the sinking fuselage, the raft finding its way to the surface with Chuck desperately clinging on, and then the camera pulling back slowly as Chuck, a small figure on the big ocean only lit by lightning strikes, gets steadily smaller and smaller. It's a bravura sequence that uses image and sound perfectly, planting the audience at the center of the chaos without ever losing sight of Chuck or the overall movement around him, keeping the evolving action clear while providing us our emotional groundwork in Chuck.Once on that island, the movie markedly changes on purpose. The first section of the film was loud and busy with Chuck dominating conversations constantly as he lived by a clock. Suddenly, there's no one to talk to and time doesn't matter. That change is what makes the life on the island so stark. Opening the movie with this would be one thing, dropping us into it after thirty minutes of completely different modes of storytelling is something else. The audience can feel as isolated and alone as Chuck as he calls out impotently to no one while quietly picking up a handful of floating packages on the shore (and sorting them by destination, of course) and figures out how to survive. The grounded nature of Chuck's search for a way to survive is compelling even as it covers small ground. Fire, of course, is something that we can completely take for granted, but when the only food Chuck can manage to eat is the meat of coconuts because crab legs are goop without being cooked we can understand the quiet determination and loud outbursts of frustration that grip Chuck as he tries to make fire for the first time.This is the introduction of the other main character in the film, Wilson the volleyball. There's a basic narrative need to give Chuck someone to talk to without him just talking to himself, and the creation of Wilson is a good place to direct that energy. Born from his own blood after an accident with the fire sticks, Wilson provides a face that Chuck can speak to, sort out his thoughts, and let the audience know what Chuck ends up planning to do. That there is an emotional connection to Wilson at all is really derived from Chuck's very understandable need to simply have someone else in his life other than the sand and trees around him. His sole companion for four years means something to him, and because we can understand the depth of Chuck's plight we can understand that emotional connection to a smear of blood on a white volleyball. Maybe we can or cannot share in it, but we can certainly understand it.There's a time jump of four years, and the physical transformation of Hanks from one side of that jump to the other is rather stark. The production famously shut down for an entire year (when Zemeckis made What Lies Beneath with the same crew) so that the pudgy Tom Hanks could slim down to his far thinner frame for the second half of the film, but that's only part of the transformation. Hanks was nominated for an Oscar in this role, and he deserved that nomination. The boisterous and gregarious fixer becomes incredibly different through those four years. He's quieter and more manic on the island, and when he gets off the island, suddenly surrounded by the world he had so easily fit into before, he's so quiet and small in comparison to who he was. The man who was so comfortable in the middle of a crowded conversation now looks like he would rather sink through the floor than bear another minute of it, but he's just too meek to do anything about it. That personal transformation is far more impressive than the physical transformation.The effort to get off the island is the sort of goal based narrative that Zemeckis was so familiar with. This is really the core of the idea that this is the ultimate Zemeckis film, the goal is the only thing for such a long stretch. Chuck decides that he can use the half of a port-a-potty that washes up on his shore as a sail, but he only has a few months to form the necessary rope, build the raft, stock it, and launch it before the weather turns against him until the next year. The effort to make all of that happens is surprisingly compelling because we have a clear goal, clear stakes, and a likeable protagonist that we can root for all wrapped up together and focused on with clear-eyed purpose. It helps that the combination of on location filming and special effects are so seamless that everything about the production feels completely real.The advertising famously gave away the ending of the film in the trailer and made it clear that it was giving away the ending. Occasionally trailers will show you shots from late in the film, but in the context of the trailer you don't realize it (the trailer for Eastern Promises has the final shot of the entire film in the trailer, for example), but it was obvious that the trailer was giving everything away. Zemeckis called it a marketing decision based on research that showed that people liked to know exactly what they were getting before they walked in, using McDonald's food as an example (he could have potentially used popular police procedurals like CSI as another). This really irritated some reviewers like Roger Ebert who couldn't get past the film's marketing to judge the movie and its ending on their own.So, let me talk about the ending and why it's great.Chuck gets off the island and he's a different man. He no longer cares about time, but he does still love Kelly. And yet, it's been more than four years since he left. She may have been a constant for him in a place without time, but time continued on without him. Kelly grieved and moved on, marrying and having a daughter. At the beginning of the movie, Chuck was so concerned with the time around his job that he never made the time for Kelly, the two needing to negotiate schedule books to discover when they would next see each other when Chuck gets called away for his fateful flight to Asia. Now, returned to Memphis, he understands how to appreciate time, and he can no longer have the one thing he wants most in the world. He could have had her had he prioritized her, staying home on Christmas instead of going to Asia, but after he made that decision there's no turning back. He has to move on, just like she did. It's a wonderful embrace of the central idea that runs through the whole film.Cast Away is a great technical achievement, which is no surprise from Zemeckis, but it's also incredibly intelligent thematically and mature cinematically. Zemeckis has grown into an incredibly assured filmmaker. I hope he doesn't fall in love with weird computer animation, though. That would be weird.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Mediocre story propped up by outstanding Hanks performance,"The last time Tom Hanks teamed up with director Robert Zemeckis the result was `Forrest Gump'.  I can safely say this is no `Forrest Gump'.  FG was a terrific story, further enhanced by outstanding acting.  This is a decent story propped up by phenomenal acting.The initial premise was intriguing.  A Fedex employee is stranded on a deserted island and is forced to use his ingenuity to survive.  At first, it is fascinating watching Chuck (Tom Hanks) adapt to his stark environment. However, after about an hour of screen time devoted solely to his island exploits, the film begged for a cut to somewhere else.  There were numerous themes that were running simultaneous to his island struggles.  There was the search and rescue, and Kelly's (Helen Hunt) coming to terms with his loss to mention the two most obvious themes that were completely neglected.Instead, Zemeckis decided that we should have all Tom all the time, which despite his gargantuan talent and over the top performance, became just a bit more Tom than I could stand.  Zemeckis did a superb job with the photography and induced one of Hanks best performances.  Unfortunately, the film became one-dimensional and began to bog down.  The ending brought no relief from the drudgery, leaving viewers adrift without the emotional release necessary to bring the story to closure.Tom Hanks was in top form.  He deservedly was nominated for yet another best actor award by the Academy (his fifth).  It seems everywhere I turn lately I see Helen Hunt.  She made four films in 2000 and I have seen them all in the last two months.  This was one of her better performances of the year, though the part was small.The film grossed over $200 million, which shows that for most people just being able to see Tom Hanks is enough.  I rated it 7/10.  The one-dimensional story and flat ending stifled my enthusiasm despite a tour de force performance by Hanks.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Solid,"I didn't like the time jump in the middle of the film, and I think it was pretty obvious the scenes after he got back from the island were shot before some of the ones on there, and at the beginning the camera angle on the parcel was terrible, but I enjoyed 90% of this movie and it's definitely a must watch if you're looking for something to do. The acting is spot on for the most part and the film really makes you think about the gap in time. By the time Chuck is stranded on the island is a perfect change of pace and by the time he gets back is a welcome change in pace. Solid 8/10

Masterpiece,"Up until two days ago, I had never seen Cast Away. Not once in my life. I know, try not to have a heart attack. I knew the whole story, each and every beloved plot twist mapped out for me by eager friends, word of mouth, online fare and pop culture over the years. I just never sat down and actually watched the darned thing. Well I did two nights ago, and damn if I didn't wish I'd done that sooner. It's every bit as incredible as I've heard all this time, and more so. It's one thing to know everything about a film just because of its notoriety, and quite another to see it, obviously. I experienced every scene, every landmark event in the film for the first time ever, and my foreknowledge of it did not dampen one wondrous second of the experience. Few films bring you as close to their protagonist as this does, for two and a half patient, spellbinding hours in the life of a man whose path has taken a turn for the extraordinary. Tom Hanks is the right guy for the job, and then some. He's immediately likable and exudes currents of good nature and humility. Perfect casting choice. He plays Chuck Noland, a FedEx honcho with a busy life that scarcely makes room for his doting girlfriend (Helen Hunt). One Christmas eve, he's forced to run out on her for an overnight package flight. As we all know, his plane crashes somewhere in the South Pacific, and he's forced to survive on a deserted island for almost half a decade. We feel every empty minute, every momentous triumph right alongside Chuck, from the first dazed stroll along the wave speckled beach of his new home, to the final, raging ditch effort to find his way back to civilization. Director Robert Zemeckis let's this larger than life tale unfold with steady, earnest shots and a down to earth score, a very simplistic approach that let's Hanks do most of the heavy lifting. And lift he does, in a performance of sheer courage and transformative qualities. We see Chuck go from suburban joe and real world businessman to a near feral being, forged into something more than himself by the same forces that govern and mold the geography which he now inhabits, while never losing his humanity in the wild chaos. The time spent stranded is sandwiched between two segments that bookend the film, in which we see his life in civilization before, and eventually after his experience. The impeccable pacing tricks the audience into feeling like we've been watching this play out for as many years as he's been living it. I mean this as a profound compliment to the filmmakers and not to say the film ever drags, in fact, for a two plus hour running time it feels surprisinly slight. It all rests on Hank's shoulders, and he carries it beautifully, selling this man's plight with truth, humour and resilience. An experience for the ages, and one that you should see right out of the gate in your cinematic exploration, as opposed to waiting till your mid twenties like someone we know.

A one-man show...,"We all knew that Tom Hanks was the greatest actor of our generation before this movie was released. And again, Hanks delivers the goods. But were this a starring vehicle for any other actor, this movie would not be the box office smash it is. The heart of the movie, Hanks' fight for survival on a tiny Pacific island, is brilliant. What bookends the film, however, (much of which has been ruined by another ad campaign that shows TOO MUCH) pales not only in comparison to the rest of the film, but in comparison to just about any other film. Helen Hunt turns in a particularly uninspired performance with yet another sporadic attempt at an accent (this time vaguely Southern) that is as unnecessary as it is unconvincing. Were it not for Hanks' performance (which will certainly get him a deserved Oscar nod), this film would be easily set adrift by audiences.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Heartwarming,"Tom Hanks being the supreme actor we've come to know did an amazing job- largely carrying the narrative on his own with the support of great writing and direction.The story is literally in the title.

It speaks to survival, courage and determination in the face of a major crisis in this man's life.Of course you have to find some humour in the whole situation, and the director does a fine job at finding light in the darkness and make you smile as new situations arise.

Utterly Depressing,"This was a long and tragic movie. It's harrowing and dark. It's not something I particularly enjoyed watching - someone living in isolation for four years straight on a deserted island, with no human contact and only himself and a few meagre Fed Ex packages for survival. The moments on the island were hard to get through because of how real and bleak they seemed.This is the same reason, though, why this movie is so good. It forces us to come to terms with our humanity and that comparable comfort we live in and take for granted. This movie overwhelmed me with a feeling of gratitude for my situation. It's moments like these, when you witness true adversity, that you realize that all those times you argued over petty nonsense were a waste of everyone's time, and disrespectful to your life and your personal purpose for being on this planet.This movie will serve as an awakening for many people and for that alone it deserves a high score. Now, the actual content wasn't that exciting. When you're alone on a deserted island there's only so much you can do, but I was impressed with Chuck's improvisation skills. It was interesting to see him escape a once doomed situation and slowly gain momentum and faith that some day he might escape, against all odds.And he does just that. And it's glorious to watch. It's nail biting and tense. The only part of this movie I felt wasn't so well done was the ending. Instead of seeing Chuck slowly adjust back to his old life, it seems like he never left to begin with. By the time he's on the plane back to America he seems perfectly normal, although a bit pensive. Quite a departure from how he was when we was rescued. Four weeks elapses from the point he was rescued and in my opinion it would have been more interesting to watch his reintegration and socialization back into normal society through therapy and the various supports they could offer him.His relationship with Kelly was also troubling because it's unresolved. Does he get back with her or does she stay with her new husband and family? It's hard to say. Questions remain unanswered, but for the most part this movie is well done and exciting to watch so the problematic ending isn't the end of the world...",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A classic dashed with Hank sauce,"From the beautifully shot crash, to the final escape, it's hard to bring up survival media without being reminded of this movie. Is it perfect? Well that's a matter of preference. It falls to an eight for me simply due to the blasé drama and romance typical of movies from this period and of Tom Hanks.He is an exceptional actor, and the advent of Wilson was iconic, providing some much needed humanity (ironically) and dry comedic relief. These are the strengths of this movie, and have cemented it as a classic.There's a lot you can do with this setting, and the time span of 4 years. In fact, a lot more would happen than what's even shown, assuming he wouldn't have developed an infection in his leg from that under-emphasized major injury. He does no base-building, and is even depicted sleeping on a rock, which is uncharacteristic of men. Since the movie is somewhat based on reality, these are weaknesses.To be frank, the beginning was boring for me, and the ending too ""bittersweet"", leaving me with a feeling of emptiness. This is something I'm not a fan of, and I'm assuming others given the rating. But I understand that this is also less common in cinema, and was built to add meaning.Yet with the level of cinematography, acting, etc. As well as a favorable setting, it is hard to go wrong.

One big ad for Fedex...,"This film just about takes the biscuit for product placement. From the first second to the end take we're under pressure to believe Fedex is the best thing ever to hit Planet Earth. We learn all about the Fedex methods, how packages are rushed from A to B and Tom lends his full weight to getting the Fedex message over, even to those disorganised Russians. The Fedex theme is skilfully woven through the whole film, with presumably Wilson contributing with basketballs ad infinitum. The Fedex packages keeping poor Tom alive. For those who ship by Fedex, UPS and others like DHL, I was particularly amused by Helen Hunt's cautionary references to ""undeclared hazardous goods"" being the probably cause of the plane crash. Heaven forbid, pilot error or some other employee disaster. And of course, Tom at the end shows how Fedex delivers regardless, as he appears on Fedex TV, with Fedex planes reaching as far as the horizon. As usual Helen Hunt is a miserable mess. How she managed to get into movies, well, enough said.On the other hand, ignoring the Fedex overdose, Tom pulls the whole thing together and makes the movie. I was truly moved when he apologised to his escaping basketball.Zemeckis must be one of the most talented directors who ever lived and Hanks is going to be a true legend.

Hanks needs better material,"Tom Hanks is fine in Cast Away. It's too bad the script is another of Zemeckis's uplifting pieces of puffery.Hanks does a fine job in the center of the film, the portion devoted to his stranding on an island, with little hope of return to civilization. Here the character is well drawn and his strength of determination is admirable. It is when he is rescued that the film falls apart. Instead of all the product pushing of Fed-Ex and his evident affection for those responsible for the loss of a large chunk of his life, it would be a great deal more satisfying to see him getting a high powered lawyer to sue the blazes out of them.

Good movie with a bad ending and a little too much Fed-Ex publicity...,"Cast Away is a movie that could have been very boring because of its unoriginal subject, but which is very good. Hanks, playing his usual nice American role which he does so well, gives a good performance, although it probably wasn't hard to do so since this role ressembles a lot of the ones he has had in the last years. The rest of the cast is not very important. The movie starts off well, and the plane crash is simply terrifying and shows how well Zemeckis can direct. The part on the island is very entertaining and you take pleasure watching Hanks learning to live in nature. The idea of making this part an almost silent movie is very good and I loved the concept of Wilson(I won't tell you what it is but I will tell you it is GOOD). What was bad was the fact that this movie has a truly unsatisfying ending, nothing really original to offer and Fed-Ex logos everywhere... But it is still intelligent entertainment.74%",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Experience all 143 of its 143 minutes...,"There are long movies that seem as though they were half the length because they were able to keep your attention and take you in to the films environ. ""Cast Away"" isn't one of them. ""Cast Away"" belongs to that select group of long films where you begin dreading the halfway point because there's still half left.The film was technically sound, but disappointingly lacing in emotional context. There's very little done to make you care for the main character, though you do fell sorry that he wasn't smart enough to take the clothes from something that washes up on shore.All in all, a dull film; not because it lacks action (it does) but because it just isn't that interesting or deep.My suggestion, see ""Lt. Robin Crusoe, U.S.N."".",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Even Tom Hanks can't solve all problems,"What a time everyone would have, moaning about this movie if Tom Hanks weren't in it - too long; too thin; disjointed; inconclusive ending; longest product placement in the history of cinema! But because of his presence most of these criticisms fade away, and in any case the film probably wouldn't have been made without him. The majority of the audience, including me, are happy to watch Hanks, whatever he's doing on screen, because of his charisma and sheer acting ability.But there are some faults with this movie that Hanks cannot solve, and at least one where he must bear some responsibility. To start with the latter, I just don't think he does enough in the early scenes to make Chuck Noland the time-driven man that the movie needs to make its point that there is more to life than rushing around, watching the clock, and meeting deadlines. Yes, he's a busy, diligent executive, who possibly cares as much for FedEx as for his lover Kelly (Helen Hunt), but on a personal level he doesn't come over as particularly harrassed or obsessive; I don't really take him seriously when he's shouting at the Russian operatives.We must blame the producers and director, Robert Zemeckis, for other problems. A major one is that by omitting a proper rescue scene the movie misses an opportunity for dramatic action (and good-feel action to balance the all-too-realistic air-crash) and also cheats the audience of the release of emotion and tension it deserves after sticking with Chuck through his long ordeal. The cut from the moment of rescue to Noland a few weeks later flying home is too abrupt.Another complaint is that, though I have no quarrel with the ending as regards the plot, the locale where Bettina Peterson lives, which we've also seen at the beginning of the movie, is just too empty, flat and boring. I'm sure Zemickis had good reasons for  choosing this location, but he doesn't seem to have had the visual appearance of the movie much in mind. (If he simply wanted to convey remoteness, why not have her live in the mountains or deep in the everglades!)Hanks has now become a movie icon in a very literal sense - the audience enters a cinema where he is starring with much the same feeling of veneration as does the congregation entering a church. This near-idolatry is reinforced by the parts he plays - almost invariably men of charm, integrity, and in Cast Away courage, tenacity and resourcefulness. It would do both him and his fans good to play a less saintly role; and this may be the case in The Road to Perdition, now in production, where he's due to play a killer.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
It only seemed like four years.,"Tom Hanks is a consummate professional who will go to whatever extreme necessary to be his character. His only flaw in this film is picking the script. Is it possible to sustain audience involvement for 60 minutes of one person on a deserted island - no people, no animals, not even snakes, lizards and bugs? Four years is a long time to watch a movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Once again Hanks demonstrates his dynamic range.,"Cast Away - Life inexorably flows by: whether it's slowing down while we're at work, or speeding up when we're at play, days blend into weeks and into years.  Not surprisingly, few people - especially those who would benefit from it most - ever take the time to engage in serious introspection.  If, however, the opportunity did present itself, what do you think you might learn?  Or would you even dare to try?Chuck Noland is obsessed by time: it's his job is to ensure that those packages that ""absolutely positively have to get there overnight"" do, and he's willing to do what is necessary to get it done, even ""borrowing"" a child's bike if necessary.  He loves his girlfriend, but their relationship is subject to the whims of his daytimer. Ripped away from yet another Christmas dinner for a quick job he gives his girlfriend a hurried kiss, tells her that he has something important to discuss with her and promises her he'll be right back.  Of course, time is relative.By now, everyone probably knows that this film is ""different"" in several ways.  First, the concept and movie came before the witless ""Survivor"" phenom, and many people were concerned that the show might taint the movie. Second, many people were hoping for a repeat after Zemeckis and Hanks struck box office gold with ""Forrest Gump"".  Third, after filming the beginning of the movie, the production went on hiatus for a year while Tom Hanks shed almost fifty pounds going from portly to waif (Zemeckis filled his time by filming ""What Lies Beneath"").  Fourth, although there are peripheral characters, the bulk of the film focuses on Chuck's time alone on the island and consequently, dialogue is sparse.  There is also an absence of special effects (with the notable of exception of the superbly staged plane crash), and the soundtrack stops soon after Chuck crawls ashore.  Finally, the initial ending was scrapped after it garnered lukewarm responses from test audiences.I never dreamed that the cross dressing star of a cheesy sitcom would one day be one of Hollywood's biggest draws.  I'm sure he didn't either.  It is difficult for an actor to give a good performance at the best of times, but when you are playing off a volleyball, water and occasionally adverse weather conditions, the situation is far more challenging.  Hanks proves that he is up to the task.Even starker than Hank's amazing physical metamorphosis, is his spiritual and mental transformation. As his carefully ordered life disintegrates (whose wouldn't after being jetwrecked?) Chuck begins to understand that what is truly important in life, water, food and shelter not withstanding, is living, not just surviving. As he struggles with desperation, triumph, and insanity, he accepts that he cannot dictate what happens, only his response. Could this have been the subtle reason for titling the film ""Cast Away"" (vb.- to dispose of something) rather than ""Castaway"" (adj.- a shipwrecked individual)?   As I don't think I will be talking with speak with Mr. Zemeckis in the near future, it will remain unanswered.The location shots are both beautiful and treacherous - paradise with a hitch - and reminded me of some of the islands I visited while in Fiji (thankfully they had places to stay and food I didn't have to hunt down). The cinematography is tight, and Zemeckis deserves congratulations for his simple, understated, yet simultaneously daring direction (if only he'd shown such restraint in ""What Lies Beneath"").  My only complaints would have to be that the beginning and ending feel too artificial when viewed in the context of the rest of the film, but not overwhelmingly so.One of the most powerful films of the holiday season.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

A nice pot roast but not filet mignon,"Cast Away is a fine movie for mainstream Hollywood. It is a Sears kind of movie.  Nothing too offensive or challenging, stays on main street, no forays into the darker sides of the psyche.  Hanks chooses his vehicles well, as compared to many of the other male superstars like Hanks and Gibson who have sold out completely.

I'm a surviver...,"...was probably a No.1 song for Tom Hanks as he returns in up-to-date life. Can anyone in a modern life imagine life without mobile, TV, car? No. Neither did a Fed-ex employee, till he hit the deadly ground of the tiny island in Pacific. Great story for a movie, huh?A story who cries out to become a masterspiece movie. Did it?Well Tom Hanks proved once more that he is one of the best actors around (although he proved his talent much more in academy awarded Philadelphia and Forrest Gump), Heln Hunt did his part correctly, while others are un-noticed.Why didn't I grade this movie better? Hmm, mostly it was too long...there are some scenes which are totally unnecessary, and I guess that this is the director's blame. Plus there are some minor things that bothered me...for instance...after the crash he collected all of the crates, but he opened it in a day or two. Why? I guess everyone would opened the crates imidiatly. Don't you agree?

Many people I heard were not happy with the ending, but I won't say anything except, I wasn't..thats all I have to say about that (the ending)Like always, Tom Hanks is fabulous in this, not only does the audience feel like they are on the island with him, they feel his emotions, especially in the scenes with Wilson (who deserves an academy award for best supporting object)This movie is defiantely one unforgetable picture and if not number one, one of the top five best movies of the year.Thank You",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

In ""The Terminal"" i don't see Viktor Navorski i see Tom Hanks.Of course, for Hollywood this is an ace up its sleeve since a lot of people go to the movies because of the actors who play in it.Having said that, The movie is OK and well made, but it would have been more credible with a different actor.

A wonderful film about abandonment and moving on,"I first watched this film as a rental shortly after my son was born. My ex was well onto her way towards leaving for good, and she still hasn't explained why, at least not with any grip on reality.Without giving away any spoilers, this movie is a wonderful parallel to the simple fact that in life somethings things happen which are completely beyond our control. We can kick ourselves silly trying to figure out what we might have done better, but when it comes right down to it, the answer sometimes comes up, ""Nothing.""Chuck Nolan finds himself in the same situation, faces additional setbacks, yet somehow manages to survive. His road back to life was as long as mine.He made it. I made it. Perseverance is wonderful, even though it's initially painful as hell. Cast Away does a wonderful job paralleling the severe emotional journey of abandonment, survival, recovery, and the eventual re-awakenings of life all men go through when they're abandoned by their spouses through no fault of their own.The term ""cathartic"" is a huge understatement.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Flawed But Insightful Journey Into Loneliness,"Cast Away is Tom Hank's latest Oscar-hopeful performance, but rest assured, a nomination will not be garnered.  Though the film is at its best when Hanks is in the drudges of loneliness, it fails to convince us of Hank's relationship with co-star Helen Hunt.  Though their scenes together are few, it certainly detracts from the mood set throughout the film.Cast Away begins by showing us Tom Hank's character as a man obsessed with time: he has to be, since he works for Federal Express.  After saying goodbye to his wife (Helen Hunt, in a flat, one-note performance), he is in a plane crash that leaves the others dead and himself stranded on an island.Time apart from loved ones and friends is an essential theme to Cast Away, that is, time should not be wasted - during his ordeal on the island, the pain Hanks feels is not for the loss of food, shelter, or material possessions.  His inspiration for survival is the love of his life, Helen Hunt.  During his stay on the island, his need for a companion grows to the point where he takes to talking to a volleyball.  In fact, the most emotionally stirring scene takes place between he and the volleyball and not the ones with Helen Hunt: when sports equipment makes a greater impression with the audience than a top actress, there's something quite wrong.Tom Hanks' performance as Chuck Noland may not be Oscar material, but it certainly is well-done, and the  long stretches and scenes without much dialogue are enlivened by some funny instances and Robert Zemeckis ironically lush photography of the paradise-like island turned prison for Hanks..  There's also quite a few touches of irony in the film, and also inventiveness that comes in the way of Hank's novel uses of some of the FedEx packages that wash ashore with him.For all the buzz that's been generated by this Hanks/Zemeckis project, the film lives up to it in the beginning and middle - but the end feels like it was hastily put together - the scenes between Hunt and Hanks feel contrived, the dialogue is flat, and they have zero chemistry.  If only the film had ended 20 minutes sooner, the solitude and meaning of the film would have gained fantastic strength and momentum; unfortunately, it's undone by a rather banal ending.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Cast Back to where you once belonged.,"I don't know what William Broyler Jr. was thinking when he wrote the end of this film, but I hate him every day for it. Cast Away is a really good movie with a really bad ending. I was so deeply involved in this movie until Tom Hanks (who proves he is still a God to the acting community), got off the island. Helen Hunt? What's up? Hunt does such a poor job in this movie I was wondering if As Good As it Gets wasn't a fluke. And if you want to know about any of the other actors, trust me, WHO CARES. The only other ""actor"" worth talking about, is a volley ball named Wilson. I love Wilson and would watch a movie about what happened to Wilson. Hell, if you've ever seen the end of this movie then you know that it would be better to watch Wilson's voyage. Advise to the director: ""Stop going so soft. America is ready to see little Tommy Hanks do big kid stuff. Please give us more credit, we understand more than you do."" *** (THREE OUT OF FOUR STARS)",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

I'm not one to give out a ten; however . . .,"""The Oscar goes to . . . Russell Crowe."" Honestly the only man that could have beaten Hanks, or at least could have contended with him (no pun intended) did. ""Gladiator"" was amazing, as was Crowe, but come on. How much dialogue did Hanks have? And yet three hours felt no more than a breezy and tight hour and a half movie. Simply amazing.Hanks was just plain fat to start this movie and admits it was done purposely. He and Helen Hunt make an abnormal couple initially, a bit awkward, but solid acting by both makes it very, very real rather quickly. Frears reluctance amidst Noland's patience in union, ironically because it is usually the other way around, gives substance to their relationship. Both are passionate individuals who want each other more that they need each other. I believe they love each other.Chuck's best friend in the movie is very sincere and earnest. Hanks' realizes how time obsessed he is with his job, then realizes he has let his best friend down. He has an inability to really offer emotional support. That gets tested and amazingly and intimately delved into later in the film.During Christmas Noland's job calls him and one of the most amazing wreckage scenes (in terms of believably and realism, not morbidness) ensues leaving Chuck to float aimlessly, like his structured life, to a deserted island. A simple idea already used; however, Hanks is outstanding here.His first instincts are pretty natural for he is not trying to survive, but merely hold over. We see him slowly give up hope of being rescued and turn over to staying alive. Noland finds some FedEx pieces and they literally, figuratively, and emotionally keep him alive, but for how long? Isolation is a killer and that is where Hanks co-star comes in. Hanks goes from outstanding to who will beat me for an Oscar (which was Crowe of course)? Time passes and Chuck's exterior is concurrent with time elapsed, including the makeup. Chuck's sun lesions to his bleached hair gives Hanks tremendous grit and believable desperation. Noland's mind remains very sharp and trivia on this site allow for some of the implausibilities, but certainly not impossibilities, from taking this movie down a notch. Also it is obvious Chuck is knowledgeable, learns continuously through observation, and travels enough that observation seems to occur quite a bit.The best part is when Chuck is forced to give us backfill. It is an organization tool that doesn't detach or break up the movie. My credit is to Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks for keeping this movie sharp until the end. The whole crew was meticulous and brilliant as seen in the ""making of special"" at the end of the movie.The beauty of the island, of spiritually, of fate through choice is all explored here. And personally only Tom Hanks could have done it: which is the definition of Oscar.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Beautiful,"This film is generally very beautiful and never loses its insensitivity at any point. The plot, though quite obvious, is full of twists and unexpected moments.

Wilson the Volley ball ROCKS!,"After enduring stuff like The Beach, Castaway (the boring TV series), and the hideous Temptation Island, this sand-surf-and-sun drama is more entertaining than the rest of the genre by far.Mr Hanks was extremely good in this film. He plays his character Chuck convincingly. When he ends up marooned on the island, you really feel for the poor guy. I even asked myself - why didn't he try to make a fire earlier - especially when he's waving and yelling at the light far out to sea - and it's night!! But then we remember he is an urbanite stuck on this small island in the middle of the pacific, and these logical things wouldn't come easily at first to the mind of a city dweller....The main story of this film isn't so much his life on the island (and Tom Hanks portrays this excellently), but the way Mr Hanks rebuilds his life once he gets back home. I was rather disappointed, because it would've made more sense to see how he managed to survive on the island for 4 whole years. The long final third of the flick (when he's home again) could've been reduced to maybe 20 minutes.The plane crash is one of the scariest I've seen in a flick. Also the best action scene in this film. For fans of action, this will NOT be the movie for them. Admittedly, its a sad reunion at the end, and things don't turn out in a typical Hollywood Cliche manner.CONCLUSION? Wilson the volley ball ROCKS! No, only kidding!!!",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Good but left hungry at the end,"This is one of those films that seems to set up everything in the story for a massive emotional landing, with a lead actor like Tom Hanks, the same director as Forest Gump's, and this incredible journey the protagonist goes through... one could feel that something great is in the brewing process. But not really. Not at all, in fact. The very beginning is pretty boring up until the crash scene which is amazing, and much more intense if not brutal than one would expect of such a mainstream production while not being overdone either. Just a great cinematic moment on all accounts.Then, it was very ambitious to make a film with such a main idea. The film goes on 2hrs25min, and the bulk of it does take place on that island. And yet it never gets boring and as an audience we're spontaneously mandated to participate in the adventure as being people ourselves we immediately relate to the great difficulty of surviving both physically, and mentally in such dire conditions. The film does a good job staying fresh from scene to scene, and not bordering on the purely depressing realm this easily could've dwelt in.The problem is a highly forgettable final act, it's made clear at the end that there isn't any of that earlier high promise that will be fulfilled and a very ordinary and flat-out weak, if not also ambiguous and unclear in itself conclusion to a story that seemed to possess immense potential on an emotional and human level. Some elements that seemed important get a very plain and often disappointing resolution in the ending narrative, and one really would've wished for a much stronger depiction of the protagonist's relationship with his dearest love of his life, something of a deeper kind with parallels back and forth between his current, hindering life and the one he longs to get back.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
