"A deeply thoughtful, multi-layered, meaningful and visually beautiful cinematic work","One film which I have watched on multiple occasions is Eyes Wide Shut. This was Stanley Kubrick's final film. It is one of the most challenging, underrated, misunderstood and complex cinematic works I have ever seen. Ever since it's release it's been given variegated reviews. The flawless visuals, deep themes, slow pace and eerie almost dreamlike atmosphere all captivate the viewer.The premise itself is the story of a doctor named Bill Harford played by Tom Cruise and his wife Alice played by Nicole Kidman. A wealthy and privileged couple who reside in New York with their young daughter Helena. After Alice unveils a mysterious sexual fantasy she had with another man Bill becomes distressed. A thoughtful Bill embarks on a late night sexual odyssey where he counters temptation, lust and infidelity. Before attending an outlandish orgy held by the rich and powerful of an underground cult. There he witnesses the darker side of sex and how dehumanizing and frigid it can be. After being exposed as an outsider Bill's livelihood and family become endangered causing Bill to resolve the aftermath even though he was given terse instructions not to by the cult. Rousing more thought-provocation, confusion and mystery to flow.In the end the film remains ambiguous and puzzling yet nevertheless fascinating. There are many themes to study such as jealousy, intrigue, fear, sexuality, fantasy, reality and dreams amongst a host of others such as psychology, sociology, human nature, society and so on. It's also an fascinating message on how sex has transformed into a technology e.g. the obsession with money. Many stress it to be an artistic film as well. Personally I don't think it's Kubrick's best film however it's still in there with his best. A symbolic, important and serious work. The title of the film is metaphorically relevant to the context of the film in that our eyes are literally wide shut to the truth. As the ending is quite ambiguous interpretations are left open in that the viewer can decide whether or not it has either an optimistic or pessimistic outcome. I would maturely recommend it",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A World of Its Own,"I remember when Kubrick passed away. I read it in the morning newspaper, and was struck with deep sadness I couldn't explain. Mind you, I was not even 12 years old at the time and had barely seen any of his films.So I went to see ""Eyes Wide Shut"" (1999) at the cinema. I credit it, along with Terrence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line"" (1998), as an experience that ignited my interest in film, since they were both films like I had never seen before. Sure, there's that one reason why a young lad might be interested in this, but I was so struck by its atmosphere and narrative flow that I had to read Schnitzler's ""Traumnovelle"". And how disappointed I was in how unalike they were. The film was in a world of its own that had a sense of time that was its own, a sense of colour that was its own, a sense of light that was its own. Every movement was languid, every word deliberate.I never really thought about the connection between this and Malick's film until now, but really, they both move in the realm of dreams and memories and projected, subjective realities – between something that did happen (to someone) and something that might have happened. There's ellipsis, ambiguity, metaphor. Both work their magic in visual terms. I'm soaked in that light from the ball even by recalling the images in my mind as I'm writing this.Fidelio – enter.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hypnotic and misunderstood,"Initially was at a loss for words with this one. I can't necessarily explain the feelings this film brings out, but I can say they feel real personal and there's just something so off yet so painfully real about (most of) this movie and it is just really undervalued in Kubrick's filmography, I think. Besides being one of my favorite looking movies ever, the midpoint turn is one of the scariest heading down rabbit hole reveals I've really encountered in a film and it just disturbed me for the entire time (you know the point) and after as it continued provocatively building to the disturbing and bizarrely cathartic ending, which haunts me as the final scene in a Kubrick film. It's perfect in it's imperfectness and I get an insane level of both joy and sadness watching this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Compelling, complex observation of fidelities and fantasies","With the exception of a late-occurring scene of deadening over-explanation wholly unnecessary to the film on every level (and rather unusual for Kubrick), Eyes Wide Shut is utterly sensational, and represents another gleaming jewel in the master filmmaker's already studded crown.  Cruise and Kidman surpass all of their previous work, turning in spectacular performances infused with nuances only hinted at prior to this outing. Their real-life union appears to bring every bit of unique tension Kubrick intended, as the movie wholly depends on the verisimilitude of the central couple's relationship.  Kubrick's tone fulfills all the promise of the title, consistently delivering an elevated texture of almost uncanny imagination perpetually hovering between fantasy and reality.  The director additionally mines many of his familiar thematic concerns, including deceit, paranoia, and blinding frustration.  Eyes Wide Shut is certain to be as closely scrutinized as many of Kubrick's other films (particularly because it is his final work), and its thoughtful and challenging treatment of such lightning-rod topics as marital honesty, sexual jealousy, and the perceived risks of disclosing one's fantasies (even to the single person you trust more than any other) is sure to draw some people in while pushing others away.",,Anonymous,Mystery
meandering cold movie,"Upper class New York couple Alice (Nicole Kidman) and Dr. William Harford (Tom Cruise) seems to have it all with their girl. They go to his rich patient Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack)'s party where he ends up treating an overdose. His medical school mate Nick Nightingale gives him a password to a special party. He meets prostitute Domino. Milich and his sexualized daughter rents him the costume. He is confronted at the mansion and is kicked out. He becomes obsessed with getting back into the secret society.There is no arguing that Stanley Kubrick makes good looking films. Looking back, there is something meta about Kidman and Cruise's crumpling marriage both on and off the screen. There is a fascination with this movie like slipping a small glimpse into their real lives. However I don't like the meandering nature of the plot and the disconnected nature of these characters. I don't care about any of the characters and I don't find their relationship compelling. The numerous naked beautiful women actually becomes numbing especially since most of them are wearing masks. They might as well be mannequins. Other than Leelee Sobieski and Nicole, none of the female characters are that interesting.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Eyes Wide Open,"Stanley Kubrick's final film is perhaps the first of its kind: it is the only film I have watched that exists within the state of death itself. It's no surprise; Stanley Kubrick died 4 days after submitting the final print into Warner Bros., Sydney Pollock died in 2008 and my grandparents, who saw this film at a screening in 1999, are dead. However, these aren't merely the reasons this film evokes a death-like state, this film evokes a death-like state throughout Bill Harford's sexual odyssey. During the Masonic orgy, which is arguably the film's center-piece, women are used and discarded as corpses who are only valued for their material gain. This film is shroud in ultra-violet blue, especially at the end of the film where it accentuates the characters' trembling flesh and vulnerable humanity, and the powerful red which contrasts against this blue reflects one of Kubrick's favorite themes: dominance. Perhaps it's inexplicable that Eyes Wide Shut evokes a man's dying thoughts. Ironically, this film feels more fresh and timeless than many of its contemporaries, only reaffirming the inestimable value of Kubrick's contributions to cinema and a decade of a cinematic drought aptly followed his death. It was fashionable to deride Stanley Kubrick's final film during its theatrical run, regardless of the fact that he considered it his personal favorite. It seems that the audience expected Kubrick to inundate them with gratuitous eroticism as opposed to ideas. Yet, Eyes Wide Shut has outsmarted time and the film industry itself. It was almost incongruously released a week before American Pie and the abysmal Will Smith star vehicle Wild Wild West. It continues to hold a mere 7.2/10 on IMDb in contrast to escapist science-fiction film The Matrix which holds an 8.7/10 rating and is listed in the top 30 films of all time, above Kubrick's more cerebral science-fiction classic 2001: A Space Odyssey. All of this may be due to the fact that Kubrick argued that 'Observancy is a dying art' and Eyes Wide Shut requires an attention to detail and an attention span that transcends the average summer blockbuster; it's easy to get lost in the terrifying labyrinth of Kubrick's musings. Though, unlike other films, Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut refutes the transcendent imagery and magic that is featured in the majority of Kubrick's films, even in Eyes Wide Shut itself, and strips humanity down to its fragile human core, figuratively speaking; Kubrick comes to the conclusion that when man is confronted with the cold and harsh reality, he favors comforting self-delusion and blissful ignorance.Sydney Pollock's Ziegler argues, during his amazing final monologue, that the Masonic orgies are practiced by society's elite which excludes Bill. Bill spends the duration of the film's first half attempting to engage in infidelity after his wife reveals that she was willing to choose one night with a naval officer over their future. Naturally, this enrages Bill and he spends the night attempting to fulfill his personal need to subjugate his feelings of impotence, sexual and otherwise. Even in the very beginning, when Bill walks with two models, his short stature implicitly denotes his lack of power. Bill is convinced that he has been subjected to a life of domesticity and his wife is responsible; he vows to reaffirm his masculinity. Kubrick paints long shots of New York at midnight which is designed to inspire the viewer with dread. Almost every single beautiful shot capturing the very essence of soft, warm colors in the beginning soon descends into the dark and strong colors that reflect the very dream-state many describe when they watch this film. Yet, to me, it evokes a foreboding death-like state which suggests impending doom.Bill's quest for reaffirmation of his masculinity only renders him emasculated when he enters a Masonic orgy and is rendered socially powerless by a group of the masked elite. Bill's journey neither leads him towards enlightenment nor satisfaction but humiliation and understanding that he has been domesticated by the higher classes. Ironically, his quest for sexual empowerment only led him to the understanding of social domesticity; Bill is not as influential or elite as he had initially anticipated. Not unlike the elite's perception of women; they use the high-class prostitutes as objects valued for their material value which reflects their perception of the masses that are responsible for their success. As in the beginning, when Ziegler needs Bill to revive a dying woman who almost overdoses on a combination of cocaine and heroin, Ziegler values Bill for his medical expertise which prevented trouble with the law rather than his personality. Kubrick's film argues that we live in ignorance of others perceptions of us and this is the ultimate existential fear of Harford; the elite have seen Harford unmasked, vulnerable and exposed. Pollock says 'If you knew who was there, you wouldn't sleep so well.' Kubrick has finally exposed man for who he really is; vulnerable and ignorant of the mysterious forces which govern him. The final and most playfully complex of cinema's closing lines concludes that Bill and Alice Harford have learned to stop worrying and love the bomb. They refuse to acknowledge their social impotence and would prefer for their eyes to remain wide shut, ignorant to the mysterious forces that govern them. On a more optimistic note, however, perhaps Bill's odyssey only made him aware of his vulnerability, and Kubrick evokes this through the dark imagery that recreates the sense of subjective paranoia that Bill is experiencing. Bill realizes what ultimately matters: love and family, as opposed to the power which he initially craved but only realized he was at the mercy of others' application of such social power. I'm open to many interpretations of this film, because Kubrick wanted the audience's eyes to remain wide open soon after they finished experiencing this masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"I know this makes me a heretic, but this film should have had at least half an hour trimmed.","It's amazing that a film this long and drawn out would actually leave so much unsaid and unclear. What's also amazing is that although I am a huge cinemaniac, I am willing to dare to say that the god of cinema snobs, Stanley Kubrick, made a film that was far from perfect. The bottom line is that although the plot was very interesting, the film was simply too low energy, too long and too over-stylized.I must stop to make a horrible confession. Despite having now done over 9000 reviews for IMDb, I have very, very mixed feelings about Kubrick's films and the following are my insane opinions about many of his more famous films. Some are masterpieces--such as ""Dr. Strangelove"", ""Paths of Glory"" and ""The Killing"". Others, exceptional but flawed--""Spartacus"" went on too long and should have ended at the 'I am Spartacus' scene (then it would have been perfect). Others, way, way, way overrated--""2001"" is is definitely so. And others are so long and dull it boggles the mind--""Barry Lyndon"" made we want to scream it moved so slowly.As for ""Eyes Wide Shut"", it is far from Kubrick's best work and it is painfully slow...but it does merit watching. The basic story idea is, at times, intriguing. There is a lot to like. But, the film shows a certain painfully obsessive quality--a need to show EVERYTHING--every emotion, every grimace...almost every breath! Considering that Mr. Kubrick was well-known for his OCD-like qualities (often shooting scenes again and again and again as well as going months or years past deadlines), this isn't too surprising. Plus, by the time he made the film he was a bit of a film guru--and adored so much that no one would dare question why this movie clocks in at almost 168 minutes--whereas another director might complete the film in less than 120.There is also one thing that boggled my mind about the movie. Although the film should have received an NC-17 rating (again, I assume this was withheld because it was a Kubrick film), even with gobs of full-frontal nudity, it managed to make sex boring! The way some of the sex scenes were so over-choreographed (especially at the party at the mansion where Cruise was the interloper) made me wish that despite the gorgeous women that they'd just cut much of it. As a result, while it's not a film I'd rush to show a teenager, it's almost sanitary enough that you could.As far as the performances go, the best in the film was by Sidney Pollack. Unlike most everyone else in the film, he actually had some energy--like he was the only one awake among a half-asleep cast. I sure wanted to see more acting like this--and perhaps, in a way, Pollack was directing himself a bit.So far, it really sounds like I disliked the film, though this isn't exactly true--I mostly just disliked the way it was directed (ahhh....I must be a heretic). As for the extremely sexy story, some of it was great. I liked how the film explored what might happen if couples are too open about their sexual fantasies and the irreparable harm it can cause. I liked the idea of a secret society made up of the rich and powerful. I liked the way that you never knew exactly whether or not Cruise might die. But, I also think I've seen much of this done better in John Frankenheimer's ""Seconds"". I know that Frankenheimer is a very, very well-respected director but know few would say he was better than Kubrick--but in this particular case I think he did a better job mostly because his film was more direct, less self-indulgent and lacked the occasionally annoying soundtrack. The bottom line is that I liked the film but far from loved it. And, for the most part, that was the reaction to the film when it debuted. Aside from the Kubrick worshipers, most seem to feel it was one of his lesser films.Worth seeing but think three or four times about having your kids watch it!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What did Kubrick want us to open our eyes to?,"Eyes Wide Shut is a movie like Casablanca or The Wizard of Oz (which is subtly referenced in the film) in that the more times you view it, the more you get out of it. (I imagine at some point you would wring out all the meaning, but that would take scores of viewings.) One infamous scene is so over-the-top it is easy to miss all the subtle references in the film, which necessitates multiple viewings. Fair warning--the more times you watch it, the more you go down the rabbit hole Kubrick digs (a reference to Alice in Wonderland, also evoked in Eyes Wide Shut).Eyes Wide Shut was inspired by an Austrian novella called ""Traumnovelle."" The film is indeed dreamlike. Kubrick recreated Greenwich Village on a sound stage in London, which, like a dream, is slightly off from the real thing and contains no superfluous elements. This evokes the perfect atmosphere for the movie as we accompany Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) on his all-night, humiliating, surreal odyssey.To me, the title of the movie, Eyes Wide Shut, implies willful naivete, particularly Dr. Bill's, and by extension the viewers', which seems to be (one of) the theme(s) Kubrick intends to highlight. Even the movie's poster seems to imply this: a mirror image of Nicole Kidman's character (Alice, as in Through the Looking Glass), looking right through the mirror in what appears to be an Illuminati image, while Dr. Bill has his eyes closed. In fact, all the shots of Alice looking in the mirror started to creep me out on subsequent viewings.The movie then indulges in conspiracy-theory dog whistles to anyone whose eyes aren't wide shut. The Harfords are a WASPy family living in a luxurious apartment in Central Part West, which may be out of reach for a doctor (basically, a highly paid member of the working class) whose wife doesn't work. Furthermore, Dr. Bill Harford (whose name sounds like ""Dollar Bill Harrison Ford"") throws around money like it's no object. Which raises the question of how he really makes his money--apparently by making house calls to the ridiculously wealthy who can afford to avoid hospital waiting rooms. Dr. Bill seems to aspire to rub shoulders with these people, but he is spectacularly naive to the realities of the world he is tangentially involved in and his actual role in it. It seems to me the reason he was invited to the Victor's (as in an economic ""victor's"") luxurious party at the beginning is because it is a house-call in disguise in case of something like the OD that indeed occurs at one point. I determined this by reading between the lines when the two models hit on him, and he seems oblivious to their allusions of taking him ""to where the rainbow ends"" (more on that below) and when he is taken away at Victor's call, they exchange looks that seem to say they had mistaken him for one of the elites, not a working-class schlub.FULL-ON CONSPIRACY THEORIES BELOW.If Dr. Bill's eyes are wide shut, then Alice's are partly open. This is implied in the very first dialogue exchange in the movie, when Alice knows exactly where Dr. Bill had left his wallet, while he had forgotten, and he doesn't remember the name of the babysitter, which was mentioned like 30 seconds earlier. This comes to the fore when he simply can't imagine Alice being unfaithful to him because women don't think like men, and she falls to the floor laughing and divulges a depressing sexual fantasy. Alice looks in the mirror a lot, most memorably when she stares in the mirror as Dr. Bill begins kissing her. Is Kubrick implying Alice is a former sex slave who is going ""through the looking glass""--the mental space sex slaves go to mentally block their abuse? Is that why Alice is constantly grooming their daughter, Helena? Is she subconsciously grooming her daughter for a similar fate? Is that why in the final scene, when Alice and Dr. Bill are wrapped up in their conversation at the toy store, Helena can be seen running away in the direction of two men in the background, who had also been in the background at Victor's party? Among the strange toys at said toy store are stuffed tigers and a game called ""Magic Circle""--resembling the imagery at the secret society's ritual/party Dr. Bill crashed and apparently a prop created for the movie. The stuffed tigers are identical to one on Domino's bed, a streetwalker Dr. Bill meets in Greenwich Village. Is Kubrick implying Domino is a sex slave, having undergone ""Beta Kitten"" programming, and the juxtaposition of the same toy with Helena in a toy store implying the girl's fate as well as the creepy conditioning the elites are subjecting the masses to?Then there are the references to ""rainbows,"" as in ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow,"" another reference to sex slave conditioning, similar to ""through the looking glass."" The two models at Victor's party offer to take Dr. Bill ""to where the rainbow ends""--where they go mentally when they're having sex. Then there is the costume shop ""Rainbow"" where Dr. Bill obtains the cloak for the secret society's party and where the proprietor's daughter prostitutes herself. The girl runs from her enraged father, gets behind Dr. Bill for protection, then whispers something inaudible into his ear. The version of the movie I own has Japanese subtitles that translate what she said: She tells him which cloak to choose. Does she infer where he is going with that cloak and does she have knowledge of what goes on there? That would seem to connect her with the rainbow image in the store's name.Finally, I question how accurate Kubrick's depiction of the elite's secret society is. It seems to be a hodgepodge of hellfire club, Bohemian Grove, Illuminati/Freemason, O.T.O. imagery. Are there elite cadres involved in these types of ritual debauchery? I'd guess Kubrick was close enough to these people he probably saw a lot and knew enough to guess at the rest (such as the sort of parties the Rothschilds threw--the exterior of the house of the party was one of the Rothschilds' residences). There are disturbing parallels with Eyes Wide Shut in the Jeffrey Epstein case and his ""suicide."" I'm guessing it is true in broad strokes. I think Kubrick was telling us society's elites engage in depravities that would frighten and disgust the masses if we knew about them, and therefore we shouldn't be so naive to grant the economic victors any moral authority.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A film celebrated more for his director than for its quality,"A handful of critics tend to rate films based on the conception they have based on a certain author rather than the final product. Owning a history with Kubrick's masterpieces I can affirm this is the last one worth of notice. The film deals with themes such as fragile masculinity, the decay of marriage, appearance and reality but also dreams,secrets, and so on. Besides the complexity of the themes which were mediocrely conveyed the captivating imagery and scenes shotted will keep the viewer interested. Eyes wide shut is scenographic masterpiece, despite the story being rather vague and empty.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Long slow journey to nowhere,"Eyes Wide Shut is a long, slow journey that leads... nowhere.  While there are some attention-grabbing scenes such as the one in Victor Ziegler's pool room, too much of the film has the feeling that they are trying to fill out time.  Nicole Kidman gives a good performance and Sydney Pollack is very good, but Tom Cruise is, well, the same old cocky, one-dimensional Tom Cruise.  Unknown, bit actors kept showing him up in scene after scene; it got a little embarrasing.  If he wasn't good looking, he would have a hard time getting work.I guess if you have 2.5 hours to kill and don't mind a movie that takes you nowhere, you might enjoy this film.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An impressive film with a bad marketing campaign,"Eyes Wide Shut is ill-suited for the summer movie corridor.  It has no explosions, no running, shouting, or a single gunshot.  What it has are long scenes in which characters talk to one another.  Slowly and carefully.  The problem is that the film is marketed as having white-hot sex scenes and plenty of gratuitous nudity, while it has neither.  There is plenty of naked flesh, don't get me wrong, but in exactly the opposite way that the ads make it appear.  This is not a movie about being sexy and naked -- it's a movie about how flesh is just another part of being human, so what is all the fuss about?  The marketing campaign is misleading, and led to disappointment in the audience that I saw the movie with, who were just looking for some skin.The tension in the plot and the issues that the film discusses aren't telegraphed to the audience, they're hinted at in the dialog.  There is no neat resolution at the end, life simply goes on.   You may watch the whole film and think ""that wasn't about anything!"" Then think about what you've seen and realize it has a great deal to say.The film is a meditation on sexuality and how it relates to marriage, death, and money.  It's a fascinating commentary on modern life, and a rare movie that dares to examine sex as impassionately as any other issue.The directing and cinematography alone would be worth the price of admission without the social commentary.  The sets are an integral part of the movie; they breathe and glow and live.  Kubrick was a master director, and he uses long shots and dissolves to great effect.  Cruise and Kidman are at their best, and the supporting cast is also strong.  It's Kubrick's magic work with the camera that holds the film together.All in all, definitely worth seeing for the un-uptight.  It's possible to watch this film and actually think about it for hours afterward.  That's something you won't get with the Wild, Wild West.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A fitting completion to Kubrick's study of humanity,"I managed to swallow my expectations before the film, setting myself to judge it on its own without judging it as a Kubrick film. No need, no need! This film IS a Kubrick film, without any doubt, and as all Kubrick films are it was absolutely stunning. Absolutely. Visually it is brilliant, though I should warn that this isn't quite as visual a film as most other Kubrick works. A lot of the film focuses on the characters, on human interaction, something rather new to this director. Of course, all the Kubrick trademarks are there, cold analytical gazes, sharp introspection. Tom Cruise seems like Jack Nicholson in 'The Shining' and even Malcolm MacDowell in 'A Clockwork Orange' at times, a rather striking fact considering that this is Tom Cruise. The performances were excellent all around, even from places not expected. Again, this is typical for Kubrick. He wasn't much of a people director, but he still knew how to direct people.Almost every moment of this film was flawless, perfect and pristine. The dialog is predictable, but in some solemn and holy fateful sort of way, as though the words and the moments are matched so essentially that nothing else could possibly fit. Beyond that the sounds and images all fit together beautifully, creating an almost unblemished whole. The only part that didn't seem right was the sequence that had been digitally altered. While the alterations were not nearly so obtrusive as I had feared (not knowing about them one probably wouldn't notice them) they do grow a bit noticeable for redundancy (you see a lot more backs than you'd expect, and always in the same places). Unfortunately these came right in the middle of one of the most visually amazing pieces of the film (one of the most amazing pieces of cinema as a whole, in my opinion), a very unwelcome distraction.Is this movie about sex? Yes, it is, but more importantly it is about people. The sex part is simply a product thereof. This is one of the most disturbingly honest portraits of human behavior and motivations ever made. The most honest I've ever seen, at least. To be put simply: It is about sex because people are about sex.I'm still trying to sort through this movie. It's been a good twelve hours since I saw it, and I can still feel it, hard and definite, rotating in my stomach. The film itself seems mostly void of opinion (not entirely, but mostly), serving more as a general statement and commentary than any specific moral warning, but the questions it inspires are very strong indeed. The film, being objective, provides no answers, no justification for humanity. There is no redemption, either, none whatsoever. The film's final word sums it (it being the film and humanity) up pretty well, for better or for worse. I guess that depends on you.A common thread in Kubrick's films since 2001 has been the contemplation and examination of human intentions, the essence of human behavior. Motivations. He's shown us violence and madness and everything else, all tracking the path back to the dawn of man. I think he finally figured it out with this film, however anticlimactic the discovery might have been. At least he did finally figure it out. That's something.I am one of many. I never had the privilege to know Stanley Kubrick. I don't even know that privilege is the right word. I do know his films, though, and while I am in no position to say that I will miss him as a person, I can say, without doubt or hesitation, that I will miss him as a filmmaker.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Final Masterpiece From The Greatest Filmmaker Of All Time,"From the director behind influential masterpieces like The Killing, Paths of Glory, Spartacus, Lolita, Dr. Strangelove, 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, The Shining & Full Metal Jacket, Eyes Wide Shut marks the final entry in the decades-spanning, unprecedented & extraordinary filmmaking career of Stanley Kubrick. And just like all of his reappraised works, is a classic that unveils more of its intricate layers on multiple viewings.Set in New York City, Eyes Wide Shut tells the story of Dr. William ""Bill"" Harford whose life spirals out of control when his wife tells him about an erotic fantasy she had about another man which shatters his faith in her. Unable to get the image of his wife & the other man out of his head, he embarks on a night-long adventure during which he comes extremely close to cheating on his wife & also infiltrates a quasi-religious sexual ritual at a country mansion after learning about it from a friend.Co-written, produced & directed by Stanley Kubrick, Eyes Wide Shut is a film about sexual desires that's jam-packed with symbolism & metaphorical elements. The entire film exhibits a sexually charged atmosphere and every single character inhabiting it has nothing but sex on his or her mind. Kubrick's direction makes efficient use of all his trademarks and just like before, he manages to push forward the existing boundaries of the medium while adding a few innovative tricks into the filmmaking manual in the process.The screenplay smears the plot with multitudes of themes & insinuations, the story unfolds in a slow, methodical manner, the leading characters have an in-depth complexity which is wonderfully illustrated by the master storyteller, each sequence is meticulously detailed & technically refined, and it has a lot to say about sex, infidelity, physical relations, desires & fantasies. However, dialogue isn't one of its strengths for every time anyone says anything, the other character repeats the same as a question which becomes annoying after a while.The technical aspects always score very high marks in Kubrick films and Eyes Wide Shut is no exception. The set pieces are gorgeously rendered, extensively detailed & beautifully lit. Cinematography encapsulates the entire picture with a bizarre, dream-like ambiance which goes on to further amplify the overall experience while also intensifying its erotic attributes. The use of colours is noteworthy while lighting here is a work of perfection. Its 159 minutes of runtime & deliberately slow pace may feel like a challenging ordeal but it never becomes an issue once the drama sets in.The incorporation of classical songs to compliment the unfolding drama continues in Eyes Wide Shut and all the musical arrangements are wisely chosen & carefully infused into the storyline. Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Sydney Pollack, Marie Richardson & Todd Field. Even though both Cruise & Kidman put in commendable effort into their respective roles of Mr. & Mrs. Harford, it's actually their on- spot chemistry that makes them click so well, and while there are no definite stand-outs, the contribution by its entire cast only works in the film's favour.On an overall scale, Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut may not be as pathbreaking as most of his masterpieces but it's nonetheless a deeply fascinating meditation on sexual relations and despite its cynical tone, manages to be an erotic, enthralling & engaging thriller. While the plot is heavy & explicit in sexual content, approaching it as a sex-romp cinema won't do enough justice for Kubrick digs much deeper into the primordial aspects of human nature to put up an exquisite looking tale that's aesthetic, artistic & unlike anything before or since. It may not be Kubrick's greatest, but it's still a genre masterpiece. Thoroughly recommended. Multiple viewings advised.",,Anonymous,Mystery

This is a beautifully photographed and acted motion picture in service of a deeply flawed story.

"Kubrick's Gift to us all.  ""I have seen one or two things in my life but never, never anything like this.""","I'm sitting here trying to come up with a clever comment about this movie to make you want to see it. When in reality it doesn't matter what I say. As Stallone would say ""I'm at least half a bum."" The truth to it is, it kind of makes me sad that I'll probably never see another movie that affects so much. Never experience a film that 6 years after it's release, I still can not forget.To say the most, it's a powerful film. The directing is world class. The camera work is haunting and the soundtrack gives me chills. It's Cruise at his finest. He is so convincing that one might actually believe that this guy is Doctor Bill Harford and this really did happen to him. And that my friends is the definition of acting. The seriousness of the situation fades away with a stern smile as the plot thickens.To say the least it is one of those movies you could watch over and over again. To be honest with you, I didn't buy it the first time I saw it. I thought it was good, but not great. Then one day I was bored, so I decided to see it again. And that's when it happened. Kubrick came alive. I became infected by his genius and captivated by Cruise's portrayal. His realization and his detail.It's hard to pick my favorite scene in the movie. I couldn't pretend if I tried. I particularly love the opening party scene. That leads to a ""Baby did a bad bad thing"". Cruise being assaulted on the street being so eloquently called a fag. The prostitute. From the piano bar to the costume shop. And finally, the unionized orgy party, that I find hard to believe doesn't really exist. Maybe only guys like Kubrick or Cruise will ever really know if they do or not.Many people might disagree with me when I say Eyes Wide Shut is one of the greatest films. But how come I think it is every time I watch it? To me, it's more than a beautiful work of art. More than a visceral painted picture or a haunting melody. It's a masterpiece that should be treasured.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Remarkable finale to a long, glorious career","The thing a lot of folks haven't liked about Stanley Kubrick's films is the fact that he always seemed to think the audience needed some points driven home a little harder than others.  Very little is left for debate; most everything is spelled out, pressed hard, and dwelled upon.  His critics have compared the long waits between his films to the long periods of waiting that occur while watching his films.Personally, I like the long, slow scenes in his films.  When they're filled with something:  music, movement, thought, memory of a previous scene, dread, or any other emotion, they can never really be said to be empty.  I like them because, with Kubrick, I can be sure that they're absolutely essential to his ultimate vision.  He could have put out a six-hour documentary on tissue manufacturing; at least I'll know that not one minute of screen time is wasted.""Eyes Wide Shut"" isn't as vacuous as, say, ""Barry Lyndon"" or ""The Shining."" Compared to those two, this one scoots along like a person trying to get to his car in the rain.  It'll try a lot of folks' patience, I'm sure -- even his most loyal fans will be bothered by the incessant piano ""bell tolls"" in the soundtrack of some scenes, or the constant reminders (in imaginary flashbacks) that Cruise's character is bothered by his wife's near-infidelity.  I know I was.Despite that, it's an apt final film for the long, glorious career of a man who has done more for the cinema, with less movies, than can ever be catalogued.  To try and cite influences for this particular work is futile. Though one might draw parallels to Lindsay Anderson's ""O Lucky Man!"" or Martin Scorsese's ""After Hours,"" ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is no less than a complete work from the cold heart and brilliant mind of Stanley Kubrick alone. It's also a furiously ingenious piece of filmmaking, one that works less on the emotions than on the senses and on the mind.  Unlike most of Kubrick's earlier work, however, it does have an emotional subtext, which is used to devastating effect.Cruise, by the way, does an outstanding job, not as a trained, camera-conscious film actor, but as a mature, seasoned performer.  Here he uses his ""Top Gun""/""Jerry Maguire"" suavity to malicious effect; like Ryan O'Neal's Barry Lyndon before him, he's an egotistical cad.  Unlike Lyndon, he gains our sympathy -- that's key to keeping us from disowning his character and thus negating the entire film.Kidman is given less screen time, but it matters little.  She's mostly seen in the beginning, and she has brief (but crucial) scenes throughout, and a masterful one at the end.  It is safe to say that this is her best performance to date, and those of us who have been ignoring her treasured abilities up until now (the Academy, critics, myself) will be astounded to see how far she's come since ""Dead Calm.""  Her high points:  the argument with her husband that ends by setting the film's plot in motion perfectly captures the way women lure men into arguments when the cause for one is nonexistent (and on Cruise's part, how men can't think fast enough to do anything about it), and her dream confession scene, in which she wakes laughing but becomes tearful during recollection.On a technical level, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" displays Kubrick's trademark perfectionism.  Recreating Vietnam in rural England for ""Full Metal Jacket"" must have been nearly impossible, but the unrelenting accuracy in recreating uptown and downtown New York City is absolutely stunning.  Right down to the diners and the newspaper stands; I shake my head in awe when I remind myself that Kubrick (a native Brooklynite) hasn't been to NYC in decades.  The lighting and photography is impeccable, also, as it is in every one of his films.This is the sort of film one sees more than once.  Once is good to cleanse the palate, to clear out all the residual toxins left from other recent films.  See it again, perhaps a third time, and get to appreciate the graceful, nearly unblemished finale of a man who took the art of cinema seriously.  It's a sobering experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The dream is a lie; the nightmare is the truth.,"It's somewhat ironic that the narrative takes place over the course of about three days because the production literally holds the world record for having the longest number of shoot days with a whopping 400. Most movies are the result of a compromise between the filmmakers' intentions and what they were able to achieve given the time and money available to them, but 'Eyes Wide Shut (1999)' seems to be an exercise in sheer perfectionism. Having said that, if director Stanley Kubrick had survived to see its release, I'm almost certain he would have still found something to pick out as being not exactly what he wanted it to be. We are all our own worst critics, after all. Still, the result is a film that nobody can claim isn't at least incredibly close to its director's vision, despite his untimely death shortly after the final edit was delivered to the studio. Kubrick was so meticulous - a descriptor practically synonymous with his work - that he even went so far as to hire a team to recreate the streets of New York on a sound stage in London using exact measurements gathered by members of the production crew who didn't share his fear of flying. Even after every aspect of the production design, costuming, blocking, dialogue and performance had been decided, the cast and crew were plagued by an exhausting amount of takes; Vinessa Shaw was originally contracted for two weeks for her single scene, but this ballooned to two months thanks to the repetition demanded by the director. Kubrick also pushed his actors so far that Tom Cruise developed an ulcer and Nicole Kidman had an as-yet-undiscovered benign cyst exacerbated by the six-day-long shooting of a sex scene that only resulted in around a minute of actually used footage. The married couple were also forced to undergo therapy alongside their director, which both parties have agreed never to elaborate on, and to have the seeds of suspicion sewn into their real relationship by an atmosphere of secrecy on set.The obvious question is: was it worth it? Almost everyone who has been interviewed about the picture, and working with Kubrick in general, seems more than happy to have undergone the impossibly tiring yet ostensibly rewarding process. However, there are reports of genuine suffering caused by this method (Shelley Duvall's treatment of the set of 'The Shining (1980)' comes to mind). Plus, art is arguably defined by the restrictions encountered while creating it; putting down the brush for the last time and declaring your piece complete is the only thing that transforms art-in-progress into actual art. In either case, perhaps the question itself is irrelevant - or, at the very least, so subjective that any answer to it would be equally as personal as it is pointless.Kubrick's final feature is a bit of an odd one, a slow-paced micro-odyssey that sees Tom Cruise wander around New York while contemplating his marriage and the role that non-monogamy could play in it. Though almost every aspect of the picture circles back to sex in one way or another, its most potent underlying themes are mystery and class. Practically everything about the piece is an enigma in its own right, from its floaty and almost ethereal aesthetic to its elusive and almost dream-like plot. The protagonist is sent spiralling into an existential crisis when he comes to realise he doesn't understand his wife, nor the relationship between them, as well as he thought he did, a crisis which externalises itself in the form of a pensive journey of discovery. Yet, the further down the rabbit hole the hero goes, the less things make sense; definitive answers are nowhere to be found. The class system, and the various characters' place within it, is explored and challenged throughout the piece. It initially seems as though the wealthy and successful lead is on the top rung of capitalistic society, able to casually flash his cash in almost every scenario and get things that everyone else simply wouldn't have access to. Soon, though, it becomes clear that he's actually on the bottom rung of an entirely different ladder, one which leads to a place so potent and powerful that nobody outside of it really knows of its existence and those who occupy it can do unimaginable things with no fear of repercussion. Both of the main themes collide - and, arguably, come into focus - during the film's most infamous scene. I won't spoil its events just in case you've somehow managed to avoid knowledge of them, but I will say that this eerie and uncomfortable sequence represents the point at which the class system becomes a mystery and the other mysteries become subject to the class system. It's a disturbing moment because it represents an intangible horror, a sort of societal wound that you may not be aware of until you notice yourself picking at the scab. Once you've heard of it, you won't rest until you've seen it; once you've seen it, you won't ever rest again. It also, in a way, represents the vast unknowable nature of the universe and is a microcosm for the feature at large.The more you think about the movie, the scarier it gets. In the moment, though, it plays out as a compelling and unconventional drama that constantly threatens to become something else. It's the sort of thing that makes you wonder why certain aspects of its plot were included in the first place, then realise that everything is as it was always meant to be. There are many layers to it and it's a very interesting affair overall, even if it is a little slow in general and takes a while to root itself in your brain. It's an undeniably well-made effort in pretty much every aspect, from the calculated camerawork to the believable performances (though Cruise seriously struggles to look as though he isn't resisting the urge to violently lash out at any given moment). It perhaps isn't for every one, but it's an entertaining and effective alternate Christmas movie that fans of anyone involved should see.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A haunting dream of sexual obsession.,"I admit that I'm part of the Kubrick cult(people that follow his movies like a religion), and I was first in line to see this movie.  Being a huge movie fan I've seen a wide variety of movies, and have walked away from them with a wide variety of emotions.  This was the first movie to put me in a trance, or dream, like state.  The way the movie was shot, lighted, and so on gave the feel of a dream (to me at least).  I believe that this feel is just what was needed and what Kubrick wanted.  Everyone has to admit to thinking about the dark side of sex, and I believe that in this movie we see that a person can explore the buried desires of their sexual id and still come away a good person.I'm guessing that this was a very personal movie for Kubrick.  He seemed to take Cruise's character to places that he, personally, wished he could explore.  Places, like a prostitute or an orgy, that he'd like to visit, but not want to stay at very long.Praise has to go to Cruise and Kidman for their performances.  Cruise was able to strip away his movie star veneer that seems to protect him in all of his other movies, and bring through the clouded, tormented, and unsure heart of a jealous man.  Kidman must have known that part of her role was to be eye candy, but she fought through that and gave the movie's best performance.To anyone out there thinking about seeing the movie.....I say go.  Some will hate it and others will love it, but half the fun of the movie lies in the discussions that will blossom from this great movie experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Schlock,"Perhaps the worst movie I've ever sat through in a theater, much less paid good money for. Only did it cause I (usually) love Kubrick. Whole thing was overblown, hypocritical, misogynist morality tale that played like a short story lifted from a 1950's issue of Playboy. Sleazy without reason, ridiculous and convoluted, wooden/artificial acting from the two leads, heavy handed atmosphere and redundant themes, all to serve a central plot which was as compelling as a frustrated teenager's diary. Sex, desire, mystery, violent urges, perversion, betrayal, all of these things put in an appearance, some longer than others but all similarly shallow.No beauty, terror, passion, or haunting moods - nothing about Kubrick shone through this mess except some familiar lighting effects and camera uses. Ultimately, this belongs on late night cable next to the rest of the erotic thrillers with artistic pretensions. Most insulting is the consistent masculine reduction of women into whores, as though sexuality still has only one point of view, only one motivating force, and it is Mr. Rich White Male. Marquis de Sade played those same games, but he admitted what he was doing, was conscious of his allocation of power. This movie gives Nicole Kidman a few dramatic, annoying scenes to establish a conflict, but her character is ultimately a nil - the sum of her husband's fantasies and projections. If you're interested in sexual power plays, read Marquis de Sade. If you get off on seeing high-heeled, thong-wearing models strutting around to Gregorian chants, you may enjoy a few minutes of this tedious farce.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Kubrick's swan song, and arguably his greatest","Stanley Kubrick is unarguably Anglo-American cinema's most potent reply to the 'Fellinis', the 'Bunuels', the 'Bergmans', the 'Kurosawas', the 'Rays', and the 'Tarkovskys' of the world. Ubiquitously known for his inexorable yearning for perfection and uncanny innovation, Kubrick had managed to hold millions of viewers worldwide in a transfixion through his brilliant works for well over four decades. Regarded by Kubrick as his very best, Eyes Wide Shut is incredibly brilliant and sui generis. It's an elixir for the sore eyes; a panacea for the perturbed souls; a surreally psychedelic pleasure. Like most of his avant-garde works, Eyes Wide Shut is open to speculation and can be interpreted in a number of ways.Despite being rife with nudity, Eyes Wide Shut cannot be stigmatized or snubbed on the account of eroticism. On the contrary, it is aesthetic as well as thought-provoking. The movie incredibly manages to have a tremendous impact on the intellect as well as the viscera, asking incessant questions of the viewer while simultaneously haunting his thoughts and refining his imagination. The story revolves around a New York based doctor whose wife's confession of ephemeral infidelity perplexes him. Consequently, his chagrin and dudgeon drives him into a night of debauchery where he gets a lesson on sexual and moral enlightenment, which inexplicably saves him from an incipient turmoil. The cinematography is awe-inspiring to say the least and is well complemented by the plaintively haunting background score. The orgy scene, which is treated with contempt by many, is undoubtedly one of the most vivid scenes ever visualized or choreographed in the history of cinema. In fact, it is Kubrick's brilliant showmanship that makes it so very special.Tom Cruise is absolutely brilliant and convincing in the challenging portrayal of Dr. Harford and succeeds in having an enormous impact on the viewers and also manages to evoke their empathy. The nocturnal odyssey being rife with debauchery and decadence, ironically serves as a lesson of moral reformation. Nicole Kidman is ravishingly scintillating in her portrayal. The couple has incredibly managed to mirror their real life chemistry and tension on screen.The movie is a quintessence of cinematic excellence and can only be relished by discarding bigotry, conservatism and prejudice. The movie is a delectable feast and a must watch for patient viewers and lovers of avant-garde cinema. 10/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
DEGRADATION OF SEX,"I am 25 years late to watch this film. The film would have made headlines when it was released due to explicit sexual content. Nowadays these kinds of films have become the norm.Make no mistake the film is 100% Kubrick. We can enjoy his signature colour patterns and camera movements. But I felt something was missing as this was the last movie he ever directed and it was released after his death.I watched the movie assuming the night he departed for his sexual desires is not a dream. There is a conversation between Alice and William at the end of the movie. It goes like this -
Alice : ""Maybe I think we should be grateful. Grateful that we've managed to survive through all of our adventures - whether they were real - or only a dream ""
I assumed that it was not a dream because I want the incidents that happened to be real. I want this movie to be proof of such a secret society's existence.also I didn't find any hidden meanings in between the lines.When Alice revealed that she would have left her family for a man she barely saw a glimpse of, it was because of the boredom and the thirst for an adventure. Not because William was a failure in bed. The Odyssey he embarked on was because he thought it was the second reason. In which he came across his worst fears instead of the pleasure he craves. Homosexuality, Sexually transmitted diseases, child sex, and public group sex. William accepts what he really is at the end of the movie. But I wonder what would happen to the couple.Kubrick is a master of inducing unfelt emotions in the audience. The horror of watching the ritual, the distaste of the naked body and the disgust he induces by showing child prostitution.You should watch the movie,although it's not his finest work but the theme is alien to us all.

Kidman Shines,"Continuing my plan to watch every Tom Cruise movie in order, I come to Eyes Wide Shut (1999)Plot In A Paragraph: A New York City doctor (Cruise) who is married to an art curator (Nicole Kidman) pushes himself on a harrowing and dangerous night-long odyssey of sexual and moral discovery after his wife admits that she once almost cheated on him.Though often referred to as Stanley Kubrick's ""unfinished masterpiece"", the final edit of the film was actually presented to Warner Bros. (by Kubrick) a full four days before his death, though the score and some special effects (computer generated people during the orgy scene) were not finalized.I have never got into this movie, it just left me cold the other two times I watched it. Watching it now, I still don't think it works. It does it surprise me that I don't love this movies though. Spartacus, The Shining and Full Metal Jacket aside, I do not enjoy Kubrick movies. I just never understood the praise lavished upon his movies.It is uncomfortable to watch, and it does have a good sense of creepy atmosphere, and the score is particularly eerie too. This is probably the least colourful Cruise performance in quite some time. (I'd go back to Far & Away) sometimes he is good, but other times less so. Kidman, on the other hand, is excellent. This is her best performance she has given in a Crusie movie (her final one) and is definitely a sign of what a great actress she is!! And what a fine bum she had too. Vinessa Shaw, Todd Field, Marie Richardson, Alan Cumming and Leelee Sobieski (an actress I always liked, and thought was destined for big things) all stand out in supporting or small roles.This was the first Stanley Kubrick movie to open at number one in the U.S (it was Cruise's sixth consecutive chart topper) but it was not a hit at the box office.

Kubrick's swansong his most underrated?,"In my opinion, I think it is.

He is a great and influential director who is of great interest to me, and his skill for directing is in full evidence here. I can understand why people mayn't like Eyes Wide Shut, it is a very lengthy film and slow, but I also find it interesting and find it Kubrick's most underrated. I will admit the first two times I saw it I didn't like it, but I have seen it another three times and each time it gets better.Like all of Kubrick's movies Eyes Wide Shut is beautifully made and edited, and has a wonderful soundtrack consisting of mostly pre-existing music with Musica Ricacarta by Ligeti standing out the most. The screenplay is mostly very good and the story is interesting. Much has been said of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, either good or bad. In my view Cruise is good, for me it is one of his better performances, but Kidman is just terrific and is memorable in every scene she's in.In conclusion, interesting and for me Kubrick's most underrated film. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Lucid Dreaming,"Kubrick is hard for me to get, and this film in particular. From my research, it seems as if he is one of those filmmakers who sees himself as a storyteller, with little desire to explore the limits of film as film. That's common enough and at root not very interesting. But Kubrick tries to be an innovator within that relatively narrow context by examining novel ways of telling his story.Here we have a relatively simple device. A married couple both dream of infidelities. In both cases, their unconsummated fantasies turn into highly threatening situations. Kubrick's trick is to have the husband's dream presented as if it were `real.' What follows is an experiment in inserting surreal dream dynamics into seemingly solid time. Kubrick employs a few otherwise inexplicable elements, like the title and the mask on the pillow.It works, but the result produces no great dramatic effect, no exciting narrative perspective.A side note. I continue to be amazed at the extra content of DVDs, Why would actors agree to be interviewed in such a way that it makes them appear so incredibly dumb?",,Anonymous,Mystery
People tend to miss the point of Kubrick's films.,"When Eyes Wide Shut was released in 1999, shortly after Kubrick's death, every critic panned the film, calling it static, cold and empty. Many people said that the performances where either dull, or just plain over the top. All I can think is ""have these people ever seen any other Stanley Kubrick film"". Kubrick didn't make films to accommodate narrative, look at 2001: A Space Odyssey or Barry Lyndon, and he definitely didn't make films for character purposes Kubrick made films about ideas.Eyes Wide Shut is about the idea of jealousy, it's about sexual paranoia in the home, its about desires and longings. The narrative is non-substantial, the film works better as a long form selection of vignettes that befall Bill (Cruise) through his dark night on the town, and with this in mind it's no wonder that people have hailed the film as ""1999: A Sexual Odyssey"". Because in the same way that Kier Dullea was transformed into the star child, so is Dr Bill transformed into a better human being. The comparisons to 2001 are many, much like that film this also has Kubrick in a more optimistic mood. There's no dehumanisation here, this isn't A Clockwork Orange or Full Metal Jacket; Eyes Wide Shut is showing us that sometimes we take things for granted.The film does however fall flat in the middle, and there are a couple of instances where Kubrick tries to sandwich in the message that `sometimes married couples have fantasies but in the end it's all okay', and I think this might have just been Kubrick panicking when the film went over budget, trying to make the story a little more acceptable. But this is on par with other films such as Dr Strangelove and Paths of Glory. And when you look back all Kubrick's films get negative reviews when they are first released, expect people to finally wake up to Eyes Wide Shut, sometime in the not too distant future.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The piano music becomes really annoying at points...enough that we had to turn the TV volume down. Many of the reviews on here proclaim the great directing performance and visual drama, but it struck me as ordinary on that front...there are much more stylish films out there and many that are more thought-provoking.

Decent film for cetain scenes abd great score,"I'll start off by saying the orgy and interagation scene in this film are pure Kubrick brilliance and makes me wish I'd seen the film edited to his standard before he passed away, also interesting is how long he worked on it and the relationship he developed with Tim and Nicole on the project, worth watching, feels a little contrived and off kilter with its setup but gets intersting as that character Tom plays trys to unravel the mysteries surrounding the gathering pre and post orgy visit, it ends rather abruptly and feels like there should have been more, not sure if Kubrik was just going for the rollercoaster ride effect or if the real meaning is as imbedded as some of the other films he made that came before this one about secret high society cults that force members into strange situations to bring to heel their obidience as the ultimate goal, maybe the point is we are left wondering about it as the end goal is to leave you confused.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Neither a disappointment, nor a masterpiece, but entertaining nonetheless","I'm surprised at many of the reviews I read here for this film. It is neither Kubrick's greatest masterpiece, nor an absolute disappointment, but something in between.I was left with the impression that Kubrick may have not quite finished this film before he died. A little more editing could have tightened things up. Kidman's performance is strong, while Cruise wanders somewhere between very good and half-asleep.This film is not an erotic film, nor is it really a thriller, although it contains elements of both. It is a pretty good attempt at exploring a marital relationship and the impact of jealousy on that relationship.A wonderfully effective soundtrack helps keep people on edge and I am still a little on edge some days after seeing it. If a film is meant to entertain then this one has reached the mark. The talk in the foyer after the session I attended was all positive - and that is rare these days.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the most darkly erotic films of all time:Kubrick at his best,"This is one of those movies that once I hear the music, everything Stops and I become entranced. Whether it's the pauses without dialogue or the traditional Kubrick Long Shots, EWS is one of the best visually executed movies though it should also be praised due to the last work of the genius of Stanley Kubrick, from the signature end credits to the notable cuts of black , this film reads like contemporary Sade on the upper East Side. Eyes wide Shut was based on a psychological dream novel and is a clever adaptation in modern society it's something eerie and strange about it that just makes it one of many visual stunning works in the Kubrick pantheon.

Mysteriously bewitching.,"This is a sensual and complex movie about a doctor whose wife's almost-committing infidelity drives him to explore a sexual underworld.More than just lust and sex, this film is full of drama and the consequences of infidelity and the doctor's forbidden visit of the sexual underworld. The atmosphere of the film is dark and mysterious, as I thought the characters gave a somewhat enticing acting performance. Kidman was good, but, I thought Cruise was a little more on the mediocre side.Though the film is full of suspense, the plot is a little difficult to follow due to its many twists; the story really tugs at your mind and heart in a haunting way as you try to follow the lead characters and their relationships.Overall, it's a mysteriously bewitching film. Not one of the greatest out there, but OK to watch on a slow night.Grade C",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A 5/10 at best,Everyone who raves over this movie is only giving the director his flowers. It's an okay film that could have been so much better. The storyline is underwhelming at best and the movie drags on with no real passion or direction. This 7.5 rating will continue to go down as time passes. I wish it was a better film but I won't lie as much of these people do...or maybe they just don't know cinema? There is a reason that this movie will never be listed with any of the greats and will never be listed as something you must see before you die. That is because it is forgettable. It's that simple.

More real than you want to believe - OPEN YOUR EYES,"I've been reading a lot of the users' reviews about this film and I have noticed that all of them revolve either around the cinematography aspects or the symbolic aspects of sexualism in the film, however anyone wishes to interpret them. I hate to break it to you people, but this film is more real than you want to believe. The question you should start asking yourself is why did the great master Stanley Kubrick choose his last film, and his greatest as he called it, to have this particular theme, and I mean the theme of secret, all-powerfull, societies? The obvious answer, which is the true one in this case, is because he deemed it to be an issue of extreme importance, probably of utter importance. Secretive cults, which use sophisticated and brutal mind programming techniques to control its members, starting from when they are infants and continuing throughout their whole lives are here, are real and are extremely widespread. They have their Manchurian Candidates all over our most important institutions and in the highest levels of government all over the world. They have a very concise plan to take over the world and they are meticulously working towards their sinister goal. You don't need to believe me, because who am I anyway? You can start by reading the works of brave individuals, such as Professor of psychology in the University Of Utah Hospital Dr. D. Corydon Hammond, who after working for years with patients who were trying to escape from the ""family"" decided to disclose everything to his colleagues in a conference. He never spoke about it again. You can read testimonies of very brave and lucky survivors (lucky as Dr William in the film --remember the scene where he starts reading a newspaper with a huge front-page title saying ""LUCKY TO BE ALIVE""? is a very good web resource about all this). By the way, Kubrick himself died suddenly before the film's official release. We are not even sure we watched what he wanted us to watch.
Don't forget to also check out another revealing film with the same theme, ""The Brotherhood of the Bell"", as well as the rare Discovery Channel documentary ""Conspiracy of Silence"". I also suggest the documentary film ""From JFK to 9/11, everything is a rich man's trick"" available (after continuous efforts to silence it) in YouTube. As the great Kubrick himself says to all of us with our eyes wide shut people, WAKE UP!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Stanley Kubrick director of films like 'A Clockwork Orange' and '2001 - a space odyssey' has done a remarkable job with this movie. He moves the camera like nobody else. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman also throw in excellent performances as a troubled married couple. Metaphoric and unforgetteble, this is Kubricks best and last movie.

Life goes on; it always does... until it doesn't.,"I was 13 when I saw this movie for the first time. At the time I had never seen anything like it. I thought it was quite fascinating.Re-watching it as an adult years later is a bit different. Also knowing how it ends makes it less thrilling. I feel like it could have been trimmed by about 30 min. (Perhaps movies these days have made my attention span shorter.)
One thing I found incredibly annoying was the loud repetitive piano music - I get that's it's meant to be dramatic, but after hearing it over and over it just loses its original effect.The film was definitely marketed in a wrong way - many people want to see it thinking it's a provocative sex thriller. But it's a rather dark movie - it really makes you think about life and relationships. It's Kubrick film so of course it's eccentric - I can see how it's not for everyone.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Odyssey of love, lust and reawakening.","When this film was released there was a small minority of critics who did not like this film. But like many Kubrick films Eyes Wide Shut is ahead of its time in terms of artistic impression and thought-provocation.First I will like to talk about some of the criticisms many had about this film when it was first released. The slow pace at the beginning and the seemingly ""staged atmosphere"" is believed to have been created to convey a ""dream-like"" ambiance. I don't know whether everyone will find this film compelling but I think the ambiguity of the plot creates everything open to interpretation.After his wife Alice(Kidman) confesses a near act of infidelity, the ""good-doctor"" Bill Harbord(Cruise) goes on an odyssey-like walk through the empty streets on New York (Its suppose to symbolize his spiritual emptiness), in a vindictive pursuit to prove his character as a man. When meeting his friend Nick Nightingale (Todd Field), he learns of an underground society that indulges in group sex. Realizing this is the opportunity to reassure himself he ventures into the society only to be revealed as an intruder and cast out. He then tries to retrace his steps in true Kubrick fashion.This film like most of Kubrick's films is artsy and rigorous picture that is just simply not designed for everyone to like because contrary to what you might think it is unique and unconventional. Can you name a film that resembles Eyes Wide Shut in terms of the density of the storyline, emotionally intense, psychologically compelling and strangely thought-provoking? You likely can't because it is a anomaly in a bland and rigid film industry.If you did not like this film, I suggest that you watch this film again and think about what I said and OPEN-UP to it. Take it for what it is trying to put forth. I've heard many people say that the first time they saw this film they did not understand it, but later came to enjoy it. And this is the case for many Kubrick films. In fact when I first saw A Clockwork Orange, 2001: A Space Odyssey, as well as Dr. Strangelove I could not understand why the academy considers them classics, but they grew on me as well.In the end, Eyes Wide Shut like 2001: A Space Odyssey will be a film that was misunderstood by many people when it came out but inevitably will be widely considered as another landmark in the career of the greatest film-maker of all-time.Rating: 10/10 A Kubrick Classic",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A disappointing mess,"As a fan of Stanley Kubrick, I had been eagerly anticipating this film.  I can now say how disappointed I am.  While Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Sydney Pollack, and the rest of this cast are all solid, the story, and especially the way it is delivered both takes forever to develop and frustrates.The dialogue takes forever for the actors to say, and I often felt like if I made hand gestures, it might help to speed up the story out of their mouths.Certain aspects of the story, characters, and entire scenes serve no purpose at all in this film, other than to elongate it.However, as for the now-famous orgy scene, it is certainly one of the most fascinating and bizarre sequences in recent film.I can't help but feel sorry for the cast and crew, who, while they put forth such a strong effort, end up in such a mess.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

adding some comments,"**please forgive my horrible English** - thanksI've read a lot of the reviews here about ""Eyes wide shut"", and it made me feel like adding some comments to my own review.1/ The fact that I found EWS boring doesn't mean I think it's a bad movie. Actually I think that anyone who states that EWS is a bad movie knows nothing about filmmaking, and should stick with ""Independance day"", ""XXX"", or other stupidities. Gee, there's even this guy who writes "" it looks like a bad blow up from a 16mm print. The sets are pitiful, the lighting is horrid..""... I can't believe it. How people may get pretentious, when they obviously know nothing about what they're talking about. Brilliant cinematography has always been one of Kubrick's strengths, and it still is in EWS. If you think differently, you need an ophthalmologist.2/Even considering the subtext and the metaphoric work of Kubrick, I still can't enjoy the movie despite its many strong features. I'm still convinced that casting Cruise was a mistake. The whole movie, and the whole story (would it be ""real"" or ""fantasmatic"") is experienced from Harford's point of view. He is immature and self-confident, and he faces events and characters that break his small world, and make him realize how weak he is, eventually leading him to total submission to his wife. He regresses to childhood by missing every opportunity offered to him to be an adult. But in the beginning of the film, we see rightaway that Dr. Harford is actually an adolescent. The character impersonated by Cruise is obviously immature, right from the start. This ruins the whole movie for me, as I'm surprised by none of Harford's reactions to the events.  This shallow character is too obvious, too caricatured, so the collision between his miserable personality and the weird oniric threatening world (real or not) he faces doesn't work for me. All I saw is... Tom cruise in a Kubrick movie!3/ I'm quite shocked by highly snobbish comments I've read from self-infatuated people claiming that disliking EWS only shows one's inability to understand it. This statement is very suspect, who are those guys to claim they actually understood the movie, after all? They have their own idea (like I do) of what EWS means, doesn't mean it was Kubrick's purpose. Like with recent David Lynch movies, anyone saying that the purpose of EWS is ""obvious"" to ""intelligent"" people, and confusing only to ""unintelligent"" people, has his eyes wide shut like Dr. Harford. Their world is full of certitudes. Beware of the awakening...I do agree with the idea that many didn't like EWS simply because they can't cope with artistic, challenging movies. But it's not my case (challenging directors as Lynch, Cronenberg, Tarkowski, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Jodorowski and the like - and Kubrick, of course- have a very good place in my collection), though after having played EWS 11 times, I'm still NOT convinced. I'd love to.To all of you who haven't seen this movie, go and see for yourself. After all, it's our beloved Kubrick's very last movie, and it still has many outstanding qualities to offer. Just don't expect too much.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Frustrating and honest,"This intense, often frustrating film details the pain, jealousy, and rationalizations of marriage.  This is not to say that it won't appeal to single people, but the movie will most likely resonate most powerfully with anyone who has been in the middle of a marital crisis, or even divorced.Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman (of course, a real-life married couple) play a couple, flirtatious with strangers, casually flexing their independence, all the while clinging to their marital bond rather for granted.  It's not until a marijuana-induced confession by Kidman's character of a sexual fantasy that the couple's crisis is unveiled, and Cruise's character takes to the streets of NYC looking for answers or relief (by way of any number of sexual situations).Neither character is given the saint treatment, and the ugly truth that marriage neither means undying devotion or even a promise not to think of sex with another is revealed.In the end, the characters come to grips with their actions, and attempt coming to grips with each other.  I suppose it's an optimistic ending, wherein they agree to stick with each other for as long as they can, and Kubrick has definitely never been so ""domestic"" on film.Of course, the film looks beautiful, and the music can be really effective at setting the mood.  The film is not an overly creepy movie, and I doubt many people are going to be tearing down theaters about the sex.  Truth be told, most people, unless drawn to Kubrick's technical mastery, will have little need to see the film more than once.  It offers a powerful message of the strengths, pains, and trials of marriage -- how you see the movie will depend on your point of view.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sadly overrated tripe,"I cannot understand for the life of me the critics heaping praises on a film called Eyes Wide Shut. I suspect the critics who gave a film the utmost positive reviews did so out of respect for its dead co-writer and director Stanley Kubrick.Eyes Wide Shut is an excruciatingly tedious and overlong movie that is more like the test of endurance than a thought-provoking philosophical movie such as Terrence Malick's flawed masterpiece The Thin Red Line. I was warned by an aunt that Eyes Wide Shut is really, in her own word, a ""sucko"". I cannot form my opinion unless I have seen the particular movie with my own eyes and judge the film based on its technical and artistic merits, among others such as logic, intelligence and content. I'm not easily offended as people might think (I consider Election one of the best movies of last year -- the sheer brilliance of the direction and screenplay blew me away -- though The Iron Giant takes the prize as my favorite movie of 1999).What irritates me most are not only the deliberately slow pace and Nicole Kidman's terrible acting (watch the long sequence in which she was spaced out and accuses her husband of cheating, then eventually confessed) but the shallow script that have no redeeming value whatsoever -- no story, no plot, nothing. The dialogues are so contrived in the first hour that I thought Kubrick and his co-writer were fantasizing what the characters' conversations and interactions are like. The fatal flaw of the movie is its glaring emotional detachment. I felt nothing for the characters, and because of that fact, I do not care about the characters at all, regardless of the situations they face.The infamous orgy sequence -- in its censored form -- was literally laughable, not because of the obviously computerized Austin Powers figures placed to avoid the dreadful NC-17 rating. There is no explanation or point about the supposed secrecy of the ritual comprising of the members wearing cloaks and masks and participating in copulation and orgy. It's an enigma why the ridiculous plot point is essential to the film -- not just the orgy but the whole idea that the secret society exists. This is simply to serve Kubrick's internal fantasies. I find it completely pointless and trivial.The only things I like about the film are the decent acting by Tom Cruise and Sidney Pollack and amazing cinematography. I thought Eyes Wide Shut is truly a mediocre film. I did not like 2001: A Space Odyssey the first time I saw it, but I appreciated that film over time. Eyes Wide Shut might as well have the same effect, but its lack of emotional distinction and absurdity (witness the weird and laughable ending) are the reasons I did not like the film.Stanley Kubrick tortured his actors and film crew during the making of Eyes Wide Shut for three years, and the final effort is not well worth it. Kubrick only wants to test the sanity of the audience sitting through the meandering and plodding two hours and 40 minutes movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Eyes Wide Shut: a Sex odyssey,"Today I had the pleasure to rewatch a really misunderstood movie. ""Eyes Wide Shut"" blowed my mind the first time I saw it and now that I rewatched it I think is one of my favorite films ever.
Kubrick is certainly among my favorite directors. In his movies, he tryes to portrait an odyssey, in almost every single one of them.
2001 is the only who has the proper name to call it an odyssey.
""A Clockwork Orange"" an odyssey through violence or ""Full Metal Jacket"" an odyssey through war.
""Eyes Wide Shut"" is the the most risky one among the others odyssey because the subject that touches, which could be really belittled sometimes. An odyssey through sex.
It was promoted as an erotic film, and that's not what Kubrick wanted. Because of that, the movie was really hated.
If you are expecting the kind of movie where the protagonist screws with a bunch of people and there's a lot of hot staff, this isn't your movie.

Lifestyles of the rich and bored,"Briefly: over-long over-rated movie by an over-rated director.More detailed comments?We see the rich and beautiful people on toilets, getting stripped, getting dressed, and being rich and beautiful. Just as in another of Kubrick's over-rated films 2001, the director takes much too long to belabor a thin plot. Photographed in a gauzy glow, the film could be called THE NINE YEAR ITCH. It's full of style with little substance. Some of the piano music is reminiscentm of old nickelodeon meller-dramas. I got the feeling that the film was Kubrick's failed attempt at being Hitchcock.The story takes an hour to really get started, and everything seems to be in slow motion. That's a self-indulgent method of storytelling that doesn't work here at all. Be prepared to use fast forward a lot if you don't want the film to drive you up the wall.Oddly set at Christmas time, it could have been a good Halloween film if it had some pacing to it other than a dirge. However, there are a few enjoyable moments: the comic relief of the costume shop and the amusingly baroque masked ball.As to the interpretation of the story as being a long dream that the sexually-starved doctor is having -- well, maybe, but unless that's clear in the original novel and one reads the novel, it's certainly not clear in the film. In fact, not much is really clear in the film. Of course, that's probably part of the theme. But I have to say it's much ado about nothing.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Kubrick knows how to keep you on the edge of the seat,"And he does that painfully slow.
I wouldn't call Eyes Wide Shut Stanley's best work or even close to one of those for that matter; he truly was a remarkable person and has done many genres throughout his career - from a war drama to a history epic to black comedy to sci-fi to psychological thriller, you name it - he had done it all. But not always with success or much sense if you ask me. This one is just the case of it.
Don't misunderstand me, I love Kubrick and his style but it seems like he has taken everything I hated about his movies and doubled it for this one: unnerving soundtrack, slow narrative with even slower dialogue delivery, weak and superficial screenplay which basically tells a story of a couple having marital problems through the prism of sexual innuendos, unnecessary exposition and characters and too much nudity - don't get me wrong, I don't mind nakedness but the movie concentrated way too much time on it, and to top it all off I have to sneak in Nicole Kidman's attempts at acting here as well - nothing about her character really stands out and she is basically there to move the already slow narrative but is not very good at it either.
But after all this is not a bad movie; it makes you look at your own relationship, see yourself in a character and weigh in on your decisions and their consequences, sympathize with him (but not too much), enjoy the good camerawork and Tom Cruise's fine acting and just burn this movie after watching but, as this is a Stanley Kubrick's movie we're talking about, you will never be able to do so.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Eyes Wide Shut,"Kubrick fans know his work intimately. From garish, blood red set pieces to long tracking shots, they immediately recognize his signatures. And even though Eyes Wide Shut (1999) would be Kubrick's final masterpiece, his renown did not die with this film. On the contrary, Kubrick's vision lives on though works just as Eyes Wide Shut, carrying forward his need to comment on humanity's more base emotions and desires.Eyes Wide Shut centers on New York-based medical doctor William ""Bill"" Hartford (Tom Cruise) and his beautifully misunderstood wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) as they navigate their relationship through the lens of lust, morality, and a need for identity outside of their supposed marital archetypes. After Alice reveals to Bill that she once considered leaving her whole life behind for a Naval officer that locked eyes with her in a hotel, Bill embarks on a 24-hour moral bender, encountering sex workers, ethically corrupt storeowners, and a secret, cultish orgy hosted by the city's elite.Cruise and Kidman are perfect for their roles, likely because they merely have to be themselves on screen. The ending of their real-life relationship is almost tangible on screen. More notable than the duo's acting chops however is Kubrick's direction and cinematography that he crafted with Larry Smith. The warm aura of the film's internal shots juxtaposed the cold, winter of Manhattan's streets engenders a sense of duality in the viewer, begging him to consider the black and white, yin and yang of morality. Is there such a thing as good and evil, or are we all just prisoners of our desires which are only kept in check by societal expectations?By no means will I opine that Eyes Wide Shut is Kubrick at his best. I found myself watching the credits roll with a sense that something had been left unsaid or fleshed out. Still, it is the final note of his life's symphony, one that mirrors this film's score: sharp, abrupt, yet undeniably beautiful at times.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Besides that, issues such as infidelity receive pretty nice focus, and a lot of elements in the scenarios also can create questions about the reality of the characters and situations that are shown.In short, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" has a classification of masterpiece for having several symbolisms, metaphors and for its unique technical part.

A lot more than nudity.,"I never turned out to be the huge Stanley Kubrick fan I expected myself to be, but Eyes Wide Shut is one of his best in my opinion. The first time I saw it, I wasn't that impressed. I believe I got hung up on the nudity and the sex. Not that I mind either. It just felt like a cheap trick to get a lot of attention back in 1999, I suppose.Now that I've seen the film a number of times over the years, I appreciate it a lot more. Sure, there is a lot of attention-grabbing nudity, and sure, 98% of the time it's naked women we're talking about. The male gaze is ever-present.But this film has a lot more than nudity to offer. Stanley Kubrick manages to create a certain feeling, where the surreal and the very real exist in parallel, and maintains that throughout the movie. Not bad considering that this is a long film, almost two hours and forty minutes. Some parts of the film remind me of Taxi Driver, depicting seedy New York neighborhoods, while other parts remind me of Babylon, providing glimpses of the parties of the ruling elites. The common thread of these two halves of society is the blatant decadence and depravity.I'm not a huge Tom Cruise fan either, but, then again, I never expected myself to be. For me personally, Eyes Wide Shut is one of his best films, maybe the best one. And his performance in this film, where he has toned down his ego significantly, is also one of his very best.

The slow pace and anti-climactic ending bother me, considering the tremendous combined talent that spend 18 months on this film. But I find it to be forgiveable, considering the many high points of this film.  The attention to minor details and characters made Dr. Bill's journey more intriguing.  Dr. Bill was painfully bland, sort of an everyman.  I too, was drawn in by that hooker with a heart of gold.  The scene where Dr. Bill is brought in to be questioned before the man in the red cloak at the orgy is chilling, no matter how many times I see it, as it is when he is getting stalked on the streets.  And the movie kept my interest, especially as Dr. Bill's actions the night before eat away at him as he searches for Nick and Mandy until he finally breaks down at home with his wife. And as always, the grand director has created a surreal and fascinating world in this film.  To me, that's what makes watching movies worth it.

"another ""Stanley Kubrick masterpiece""","I have watched this movie for a couple of times, but I feel that I could watch it over and over again and still find it interesting and mysterious. It has an outstanding complexity, formed by adding it's message (or messages, because we're talking about a Kubrick film) to the other features, such as the plot, setting, cast, or the image.It questions a moral problem linked to the human nature, exposed through a plot which is slowly developed, but once realized by the main characters, it fixes it's roots deeply into their perspectives and actions. Basically, every scene is a key, a piece of a puzzle that, at least in my case, has not been completed even by today. As usual, Kubrick seems to have thrown away the last piece of this puzzle, engaging the viewer to ""create"" his own piece, based on his particular perspective on the approached subject(s).It is full of hidden symbols and clues, which I haven't even spotted before watching several youtube clips about this movie. Somehow, it seems that every object has it's own part in this movie, and without it, the film couldn't be completed. As a result, the second time I have watched ""Eyes wide shut"" I occasionally paused the movie just to make sure that I haven't omitted anything.In conclusion, I strongly recommend you watch this movies, as it may open your ""wide shut"" eyes.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""Soshall we?""","I have a feeling that Kubrick's stunningly masterful visual exploration of human sexuality will be overshadowed by the major amount of nudity in it, and the graphic sex scenes. It seems that the movie is more well-known because Nicole Kidman is fully nude in it (and Tom Cruise, conspicuously, is heavily covered, even his hands, throughout), despite the fact that she was fully nude in Billy Bathgate back in 1991 but no one cares much about that. Maybe she wasn't famous enough back then. At any rate, she is nude within literally about the first 5 seconds of the film, when we meet her and her husband Dr. Bill Harford.They have been invited to a classy dinner party which illustrates their place in society, and we meet them as they are getting ready to go out. Clearly, they live a very good life, seemingly much more than even a doctor could afford, given that they live in New York in a sizable mansion. They have been married and faithful to each other for 9 years, have a beautiful 7- year-old daughter, and a very comfortable home. Life is secure, but even in this opening scene, there is an undercurrent of something missing, almost as though they are just going through the motions of their marriage. Alice (Kidman) laments that Bill blandly tells her she looks great without even looking at her, and Bill isn't too excited about the party at all.But the real problem with their marriage is presented in a way that only Kubrick could come up with. Cruise and Kidman are beautiful people, so it's easy to accept a classy older man being extremely direct with his interest in a romp with Alice (""then and there,"" as she explains later), and that two stunningly beautiful women will attempt to seduce Bill, all at about the same time. Neither is unfaithful, but this event sets off a chain reaction that leads them down an alarming road.Later, when Alice asks Bill if he had sex with those two women (in much more colorful language than I am allowed here), he sort of laughs it off and assures her that he did not. What he doesn't notice at first is that she doesn't seem the least bit upset or worried when she asks him this, she seems blithely interested, even curious, as though part of her hopes that he did, which would allow her to form some kind of justification in her own mind about being unfaithful herself, something that she has clearly thought about. When she hears that he didn't, she's not very happy, and she lashes out at him with a story that creeps into his mind and turns his life upside down. She has always been faithful to him, but she tells him a story of something that happened that might have been even worse.A lot of people criticize the movie for how slow it is in a sad misunderstanding of one of the movie's greatest strengths. It has a strange, dream-like quality that derives from its pacing, and this is not an accident, nor is it meant just to make the movie run as long as it is. And it is not about sex, either. This should be obvious, I think. Sex happens in the movie, but it's not about sex, but sexuality. The difference is bigger than you think. It's about the fact that humans are essentially animals with very primal physical needs, but we lift ourselves above beasts by controlling those desires and channeling them into meaningful relationships. This, the movie seems to suggest, is one of the reasons why an unfaithful spouse is such a crippling blow to someone. The most moral and sacred pact of the marriage has been broken.More specifically, it seems to suggest a human desire (amidst both males and females) for anonymous sex, in the sequence where Bill manages to get into the mansion and witness this taking place, and the vicious threats that he receives when he is discovered. A lot of people have called this a dream sequence, which doesn't make a lot of sense to me, since it is so clearly not. It's bizarre, yes, but I didn't notice anything that would suggest very strongly that it's a dream, outside of the allowance for this possibility. It may have just been left open to that possibility to provoke discussion, but it works better as a real experience than as a dream. Later, Alice confesses a real dream, which is disturbingly close to what Bill saw at that house, and it is a tremendous blow to him.It should be noted that the movie goes to great lengths to explore the trust in a marriage, and both parties are desperately hurt by what the other has said or done, yet neither of them were ever unfaithful to the other. The performances are phenomenal throughout, and made better by an astonishingly well-written script. You may notice, as the movies nears the end, that remarkably little actually happens in it, and yet the movie says so much. It makes a striking comment about the role of sex in a relationship, and yet never exploits it.Sadly, a lot of moviegoers are too shortsighted or narrow-minded to understand the film, which is why you get people saying it's the worst thing that Kubrick has ever come out with. It is very normal for a person to condemn as ridiculous something that they can't understand, and this will happen with this movie. But make no mistake, the movie is brilliant, and more than a worthy addition to Kubrick's short but powerful iconography",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A slow beginning, a beautiful middle, but a weak end","This movie has the feel of not having been completed. There are sub-plots that seem to have been abandoned, questions brought up in the film that go unanswered, and editing that seems sloppy in some places while brilliant in others.Some scenes, such as the one where Cruise walks into the room with the cloaked figures in a circle, seem vintage Kubrick. He captures a surreal view with perfect timing. Other scenes, though, seem poorly shot. The scene in which Kidman starts laughing and drops to the floor, then lays face down on the floor, then sets upright, then lays down again seems markedly ill shot. The camera is in for a close shot on her and follows her down to the floor, it then jerks back up when she sits up, and then follows her back to the floor again. This seems poor camera work. If she is going to flop up and down, the camera should have made a wide shot. If the scene called for a close up, it should have had a cut to Cruise interspersed to avoid having to jerk the camera down, up, and back down again. This was a bad enough shooting sequence that it stood out disturbingly in an otherwise excellent scene. I have seen amateurs with video cameras follow movement more smoothly.The editing also seemed rushed. Several scenes seem to have the film footage of one scene just spliced right on to the end of the footage of the previous scene with no transition footage at all. This may be all right for music videos, but I would expect better editing in a feature film.There are also several subplots that are introduced, developed, then simply dropped. Kidman's dance partner in the party segment has a lot of screen time invested in him with a commiserate interest by the viewer. What happened? This was far too much time to just set up Kidman's view on fidelity. The viewer expects something of this to come back, but nothing ever does. Cruise's pianist friend's fate is never disclosed. A simple call to the West coast would discover if he was sent home, murdered, disappeared, or something. Admittedly he was a minor character, but the audience has some time and interest invested in him and it would like to know his fate. Kubrick doesn't always give answers, but he does give enough information for the viewer to deduce what is going on. Not this time, though. The same could be said of the dead woman from the party. Murder, suicide, accident? Cruise's character is a doctor, it shouldn't be that hard to look for forensic evidence to discover the truth. But the movie is silent on this matter.I have seen nearly all of Kubrick's movies, most of them several times, and this is by far the worst edited and constructed of them all. The subject matter may be in the mind of the characters and actual factual matters don't matter, but it is still disconcerting to the viewer. My personal opinion of this film is that Kubrick himself never finished it. The editing and scene selection seemed very inconsistent with any thing he had done before. The story line seems unfinished with loose ends dangling through out. I think what we have is three fourths of a Kubrick film and one fourth of something else. The recognizable Kubrick parts are brilliant in places, the rest is not.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Worthy Closing,"Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut was his final film made (as many people know) and as it is his last it is no less than a perfect Stanley Kubrick film.  He can still grab you with his terrific filmaking in a sexual odyssey that seems not only extraordinary to his audience, but to himself as well (he took a twelve year interlude between making Full Metal Jacket in 1987 and this film).The acting is also superb, mainly by the real life husband and wife Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as the couple who hold many secrets from each other.  The film goes on a little longer than some of Kubrick's past ones, but thats because there is a lot more detail in this picture than hin his other ones, including sexual rendevous, long dialogues and scenes of intrigue.  In short, this is Kubick's last, one of his best, and most intriguing films.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Slow-paced, semi-erotic, bore","I know a lot of people have gone to see this movie for the obvious reasons of nudity.  I myself am part of this demographic I suppose, so I thought that this movie might hold my interest somewhat.  Tom Cruise plays a lawyer who is married to a simple homemake (Kidman).  Cruise's character is, in my view, plagued by the need of a more sexually exciting life.  He is a curious type that seems to want to experience everything at least once. A good idea. However, the way this is portrayed is slow, boring, and simply uninteresting even with the nudity.

Kubrick last torture to all,"What is this movie is all about? This movie just made me rethink my beliefs in the rating system of IMDb. Seriously, I like drama, slow, thriller movies, even if they are slow, I don't mind, but they should serve a purpose.Here it seems like that the director needed an excuse in name of philosophy, meaning of life (or whatever crap people think this movie is all about), to serve up the sex & orgy in the movie. Movies like this are the perfect example, how a movie should never be made.Don't make out this movie to be some classic just because it was the last movie that the director directed.

Kubrick In His Final Days,"A New York City doctor (Tom Cruise), who is married to an art curator (Nicole Kidman), pushes himself on a harrowing and dangerous night-long odyssey of sexual and moral discovery after his wife admits that she once almost cheated on him.At this point (2015), I have seen all of Kubrick's work and love most of it. But ""Eyes Wide Shut"" was one of my earlier Kubrick excursions, following the cult classics. At the time, responses seemed to be mixed. While I instantly loved it, others found it to be hard to handle.If anything, my opinion over the last fifteen years has only solidified this as being among Kubrick's best. We start out with some intrigue, then get into a light philosophical conversation about infidelity... before going head-on into a conspiracy theory that somehow still makes sense. This is a grand adventure, much larger in scale than anything else he had done. And he pulls it off brilliantly.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Grand Finale,"I guess Kubrick couldn't have wished for a better way to end his impressive filmography.'Eyes Wide Shut' is a perfect ending to one of the most accomplished directorial careers and easily one of his finest works, right up there with 'A Clockwork Orange' or his early gem 'The Killing'.The magic of this movie lies in how the story unfolds..and deeply explores the human psyche; delves through the numerous assumptions and beliefs that one lives with, regarding the opposite sex, regarding marriage and regarding commitment and fidelity. At the same time, it urges the viewer to think.The story may seem a slow pacer, but not a single frame or scene is out of place or irrelevant to the story.It all starts with a party Dr William Harford (Cruise) and his wife Alice (Kidman) attend. They encounter certain strangers there. The couple converse about the ongoings at the party, and the discussion soon turns into a sour one, with Alice confessing about how she once almost cheated on him. This is when William goes into a state of shock and disbelief and starts questioning his assumptions about married life and commitment. Unpleasant thoughts cross his mind following that revelation. And about this time, he leaves for a certain funeral and this is how his bizarre odyssey begins.Kubrick builds up the atmosphere like a hypnotist, and makes sure the viewer watches the story unfold in awe..and get a feel of what Cruise's character experiences.The rest of the movie has to be seen to be believed and any synopsis won't do justice to this magnificent film.This is one of Cruise's finest performances. Kidman does a terrific job. Of the supporting cast, Sydney Pollack is superb as Victor Ziegler. Likewise, Todd Field, Rade Serbedzija and Mary Richardson in a small role.But what makes this movie much more watchable is the fantastic cinematography, brilliant direction, and the oh-so-mesmerizing score.'Eyes Wide Shut' is a Collector's item for any respectable film buff. A hypnotic experience...do not miss it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Do you like scary movies?,"Perhaps his best, undeniably his bleakest, Eyes Wide Shut provides us with the most depraved view of the human condition we've bore witness to in a Kubrick film.Beyond the engaging storyline, lush cinematography and flawless performances, Kubrick's view of human depravity manifests itself not on the fields (or training grounds) of war, nor in government facilities, nor in space, but in the apartments and homes of New York's millionaires, billionaires and prostitutes. In this veritable horror film, there are neither characters who find redemption nor those who escape their own predicaments unpunished.Sidney Pollack, whose drooglike visage hovering over the unconscious prostitute during an overdose, a foreshadowing of some real nastiness, shows us that wealth and evil do compliment each other quite nicely. A woman who lunges at Cruise's Dr. Harford exclaiming ""I love you!"" while her father's corpse lies behind them and her fiancee enters the apartment, pales in comparison to the likeable prostitute who contracts HIV.Beyond its devastating cinematography and score, (I can only imagine the number of takes for this one) the masked-ball orgy sequence provides us with a new and undeniably disturbing understanding of the relationship between sex and power and violence.  Only in a world constructed by Kubrick could such scenery serve as backdrop to the doomed marriage reduced to one convincingly uttered word by Mrs. Kidman in the toy store during the final scene. Someone mentioned a bleakness comparable to Bergman's Wild Strawberries. I think this is worse. And better.",,Anonymous,Mystery
The last Masterpiece!,"It was inevitable that Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut would be the most misunderstood film of 1999. Kubrick died four months prior to its release, and there was no end to speculation how much he would have tinkered with the picture, changed it, ""fixed"" it. We'll never know. But even without the haunting enigma of the director's death--and its eerie echo/anticipation in the scene when Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) visits the deathbed of one of his patients--Eyes Wide Shut would have perplexed and polarized viewers and reviewers. After all, virtually every movie of Kubrick's post-U.S. career had; only 1964's Dr. Strangelove opened to something approaching consensus. Quite apart from the author's tinkering, Kubrick's movies themselves always seemed to change--partly because they changed us, changed the world and the ways we experienced and understood it. And we may expect Eyes Wide Shut to do the same. Unlike Kubrick himself, it has time. So consider, as we settle in to live with this long, advisedly slow, mesmerizing film, how challenging and ambiguous its narrative strategy is. The source is an Arthur Schnitzler novella titled Traumnovelle (or ""Dream Story""), and it's a moot question how much of Eyes Wide Shut itself is dream, from the blue shadows frosting the Harfords' bedroom to the backstage replica of New York's Greenwich Village that Kubrick built in England. Its major movement is an imaginative night-journey (even the daylight parts of it) taken by a man reeling from his wife's teasing confession of fantasized infidelity, and toward the end there is a token gesture of the couple waking to reality and, perhaps, a new, chastened maturity. Yet on some level--visually, psychologically, logically--every scene shimmers with unreality. Is everything in the movie a dream? And if so, who is dreaming it at any given moment, and why?Don't settle for easy answers. Kubrick's ultimate odyssey beckons. And now the dream is yours.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What did Kubrick know about women?,"I agree with Spielberg's comment on the DVD about Kubrick's attention to detail.  What I am less confident about is the older Kubrick's attention to the forest which he makes with his trees.Perhaps I am wrong in caring whether very many women would utter the last line in the film after a comparable experience.  Maybe it is enough to ask whether this woman would say the line, and whether this woman is complete and coherent.Since I have a problem understanding the motivation of the man, maybe the movie did not hit me hard.It's very handsome.  The DVD I saw cuts almost all of the theater film's opening scene of the naked woman putting on earrings.  If I wore earrings I think I would put them on after I dressed, not before, as I do my only jewelry: my watch and my eyeglasses",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
So freaking good!!!,"From the first scene itself when the camera moves seductively over the naked body of Nicole Kidman, you know you are in throes of a legendary director. Kubrick, who passed away one week after completing the edit on this movie, makes one of his best flicks here. Based on a 1926 book called Dream Story, this tells about a doctor, played quite well by Tom Cruise, who goes on a night of sexual discovery after learning that his wife, played by Kidman who was his real wife at that time, almost cheated on him once. He meets a motley of characters and his interactions with them are written and directed superbly by Kubrick. There is the unforgettable scene in the castle which will send shivers down the spine. In the acting department, Kidman easily bests Cruise even though she has a much smaller role. The background score is superb. There are scenes which depict orgies and they understandably are explicit. The scenes are set up and executed so beautifully. Kubrick was in a class of his own. This is his final movie and the touch never waned. 4 out of 5 for this masterpiece.

Especially the cinematography......my god, it is truly of epic preportions....but by Kubrick standards, thats already a given. But the greatest scene of all, is especially the mansion scene, and no, not because of the heavy sex and nudity.....because up until that point, Tom Cruises character wanders the street of New York, on his fit of rage and jelousy towards his wife.....this is basically a giant build up, and the delivery and response when he walks in that mansion is truly overwhelming......because i think it was more than the character and the audience expected. But that entire build up and delivery was just so perfect, and it all meshed together with a haunting score..... it still gives me goosebumps to this day.

Frustrating Last Entry from Kubrick,"It's a shame that something as muddled (though fascinating and watchable throughout) as ""Eyes Wide Shut"" would become the last movie directed by possibly the greatest director of all time, Stanley Kubrick. It showcases all the things his detractors had been falsely claiming for years: he's out of steam, it's too long, it's too weird, and it has no point. Unfortunately the film is as overshadowed by the fact that it's Kubrick's last as it is by the fact that it was released at the height of Cruise and Kidman's status as Hollywood's uber-couple. Oh, how we wish Kubrick could be with us today, and how we all thought Tom and Nicole would last forever.Kubrick's look at marriage and fidelity can be boiled down pretty easily: misadventures in unfaithfulness can be equally damaging playing out in one's imagination as they can be in reality. Despite a great, raw, and entrancing performance from Nicole Kidman, the film is pretty much one-sided and dedicates most of its runtime to Tom Cruise's unrealistic though entertaining nightly escapades. Only in a Kubrick film would a man find the prettiest, most polite, kindest hooker in New York City and then just happen upon a huge aristocratic sex cult at some castle/mansion out on Long Island. The whole thing is more kinky than erotic and just a bit silly, which isn't to say it's without its merits.In the end, in spite of its flaws, I think it's rather fitting that the last line of the last film of a director like Kubrick who always had such a dark sense of humor would be, ""f*ck"" and be spoken by one of the most elegant and beautiful and talented actresses of her generation. Sounds like a great idea.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A very unusually bad film.,"By writing this, I am hoping that I will save people a lot of time and money.  Last night I went with a friend to see Eyes Wide Shut, Stanley Kubrick's final masterpiece.  Supposedly, he had wanted to make this film for twenty-seven years, and spent sixty-seven weeks shooting it, an incredible amount of time for a commercial film.  Being the sort of mug film buff that I am, I thought that I should go to see a film made by an acknowledged master, who had  spent so much time getting it just right.When the film finally ground to a halt, the audience in the cinema stood up and as one started muttering things like ""Is that it?"",  ""Thank goodness that's over"" ""Well, you can see why there are only two showings per day"", ""What a pile of ****"".  I have never heard a cinema audience respond so negatively to a film before.  We talked about it, and we had not a single kind word to say about it.  I have thought about it since, and find it void of redeeming features.It is badly photographed. The sets are often unconvincing. The acting is mediocre. The continuity is poor. The lighting is awful. The picture quality is poor.  It looks as though it was shot on 16mm, and the prints were made at Boots. Hardly anything happens which is believable. There are gaping holes in the plot. Worse than all the above, it is  incredibly  slow.  At no point does the pace quicken.  It is wildly too long. Every single conversation happens at a snail's pace.  Almost every conversation is punctuated by very long awkward pauses.  It seems as though Stanley thought about every scene so much in isolation, that each scene took on great significance, and to get the importance of what was happening across, he dwelt on every word and action.  Every scene could be halved in length and lose nothing and gain much.I was expecting a film in which Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise play roughly equally large parts.  The film is almost entirely about the Tom Cruise character.  I was expecting an intelligent exploration of jealousy and relationships and the like.  Instead we get half way to a thriller, but not all the way, not enough to make it interesting, and there is no intelligent comment on human nature, nor, so far as I can tell, on anything.This film takes itself so amazingly seriously, and yet is transparently ludicrous from start to finish.  Human beings don't behave like that. Nothing made sense.  Characters kept acting on information which they didn't have.  The various parts of the world were not using the same clock.  The sun kept rising and falling at odd times, and characters would go back to somewhere they'd been the day before, to find that no one there had moved, changed clothes, or even finished what they were saying.Yes, there is a bit of nudity in it, but this is presented in scenes of such unnecessary length, and such little incident, that you just wish they'd get on with the next scene.Having more recently spoken to several other people who saw it, I have encountered near-uniform condemnation of this shamefully bad film.  One person fell asleep during it several times.  One had to apologise to the five people who went with her to see it, who all hated it (it had been her idea to go to see it).  Only two people reportedly enjoyed it, but they enjoyed it solely because they thought that it was so bad that it was funny. I say that it is too dull and slow to be found entertaining that way.I would thoroughly recommend this film to people I intensely dislike.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

flawed Kubrick opus,"Is it heresy or sacrilege to suggest at this late date - and particularly in light of his recent death -  that Stanley Kubrick's films have almost always been better at promising than delivering greatness?  Almost without exception, Kubrick's carefully crafted works have emerged as brilliantly clinical ""exercises"" rather than fully involving works of timeless art. Audacious, visionary, always willing to push the envelope and challenge an audience to go where it may not want to - these are the hallmarks of Kubrick's directorial genius.  But, along with these virtues, comes a heavy list of counterweighing weaknesses that somehow distance an audience emotionally from what is occurring on the screen:  pretentiousness, laborious pacing, narrative choppiness, often static camerawork.  ""Eyes Wide Shut"" fits perfectly into this standard Kubrick mold.  Starting with a fascinating premise, Kubrick takes his audience into unexpected and challenging directions, yet fails to really cope with the complexities of the theme and make the audience care.  Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman portray a young, upwardly mobil couple, who live in New York City with their young daughter.  When Kidman, in one of the year's best scenes, reveals in a wrenching monologue that she has had serious thoughts of infidelity, Cruise discovers he can't cope with the visions this admission conjurs up.  Thus, he embarks on a sexual odyssey through the streets of the city which leads him into many bizarre and unexpected avenues of depravity including a club made up of the idle rich dressed in costumes and masks who stage orgies replete with secret passwords and portentous organ music.  The problem lies essentially with the Kubrick/Frederick Rafael screenplay which can't seem to connect these scenes of flamboyant nastiness with the theme that is at the film's core.  Cruise drifts into each of his adventures out of an understandable urge to experience this world of sexual perversity, but he seems to end up as a passive observer each time, with little or no revelation registered.  This concept - of examining the effect that even implied infidelity can have on relationship - is such a rich one that it becomes a shame to see it buried under these scenes of often extraneous ostentation.  Kubrick seems so enamored of his little ""visions"" that they begin to dominate the proceedings and bury the theme and the characters. This weakness is reflected in the film's far too tidy resolution, which is thoroughly unconvincing from a psychological viewpoint and makes one wonder how Kubrick could linger so long over scenes with no purpose beyond the sensational yet take so little time with the one that truly matters.  Cruise and Kidman both turn in fine performances, but Sydney Pollack, as a wealthy friend who later in the film sets Cruise straight, hams it up shamelessly. The music is hauntingly effective and helps immeasureably to establish and sustain an atmosphere of portentous weirdness. The title ""Eyes Wide Shut"" will not describe most people in the audience - Kubrick is too skilled at creating an always riveting visual motif for that - but, for me, it will serve as a lasting testament less to his genius than to his maddening inability to fulfill his always great promise.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Sorry, I Just Don't Get It","I'm a major fan of Stanley Kubrick's films, though I'm not always the greatest at dissecting them for the deepest content. Still, I can usually walk away with a good understanding of what Kubrick was trying to convey, but not here. For whatever reason, I couldn't see anything but the surface value of Kubrick's EYES WIDE SHUT. The film is about Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) and his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman). Alice reveals to Bill that she once thought of having an affair and how she would've given up her entire life, her husband, her daughter, etc. for even one night with a passing Naval officer she'd seen. This news completely destroys Bill and he sets out into the streets of New York with visions of his wife in the arms of another man haunting his mind. Over the course of the night, he stumbles into a mysterious gathering in a secluded home where the halls are filled with people engaged in a ritualistic orgy. When Bill is discovered as an intruder and he believes a woman has been killed in order to protect him, he begins an his own investigation into what happened that night.Kubrick always seemed to have a much deeper meaning behind the surface story and I'm sure this film is no different. Many critics and fans have praised this film endlessly, so I'm sure there is more to it than meets the eye. I'm sorry to say I just don't get it. It seems to hint at a glimpse into jealousy and the power of sex (or lack thereof) in relationships. For me, all of this potential subtext is lost when I'm drawn into the mystery behind the strange cult/society Bill wanders into. For the remainder of the movie, I just wanted to see this plot-line pan out and fill in the answers and any subtext was overlooked. If you're a true Kubrick fan and haven't watched this film yet, I hope you won't let my own inability to understand it influence your decision in any way. This film has been hailed by some as a masterpiece and is still an intriguing, suspenseful drama.Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman do a fantastic job here, especially Kidman who's every line seems to drip with venom following their initial stoned confrontation over her once-desired infidelity. At the time of the film, the two were still married and I'm sure it contributed to their chemistry on-screen (well, maybe the awkwardness between the two sexually in the beginning or the animosity to come later). Again, Kubrick utilizes his masterful skills at creating atmosphere with his grainy footage, minimalist piano score, and colorful lighting. Despite the slow crawling pace of the film, it manages to remain engaging despite it's nearly three hour runtime. The ending was less than stellar and I felt it left a lot of loose ends, but again that's because my focus was on the mystery as opposed to the Harford's relationship. When the movie was over, it left me wanting answers but I still had the usual unease that seems to follow all of Kubrick's films. This film is probably best for true Kubrick fans and will leave the more casual fans a little underwhelmed.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
1999: A Sex Odyssey,"As long as you don't buy into the hype that surrounds pictures like EYES WIDE SHUT, you can watch without prejudice and assess what you are seeing more precisely.  Let me say that Stanley Kubrick's final film is a psychological and visual masterpiece.  The ridiculous media hype generated by the famed director's meticulous filmmaking methods and the film's allegedly ""pornographic"" style with stars such as Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman is flat out sad.  It is an extremely GOOD film with some truly GREAT moments.  Kubrick's swan song is his best work since A CLOCKWORK ORANGE in 1971.Short-attention span viewers beware:  Stay Away!  Go see ARLINGTON ROAD if you want generic, meaningless entertainment.  Smart, discerning moviegoers with an eye for art and unique cinema must, and probably will, see EYES WIDE SHUT.  This is an engaging and excrutiatingly candid look at sexual obsession and jealousy within a man's mind and heart.  Sex is what human beings, specifically males, think of most.  What an exploration into a few days in the life of a jealous husband who falls into some strange and disturbing sexual situations.Is the film soft-core porn?  Absolutely not.  The sex scenes are very mild in accordance to what has been reported through both rumors and initial reviews.  Is the film about sex and only sex?  In a way, yes.  Sex involves passion and love, jealousy, and danger.  These 4 elements are tied together with such disturbing subtlety, quite frankly I was spellbound.  Sex also involves temptation and aftermath, which is also pertinent to the rather linear story.  Kubrick and company do not go over the top.  They merely present to us a dangerous nightmare maybe not entirely unlike the Kidman character's sexual dream and revelation.EYES WIDE SHUT is long, but seems bitterly quick and I couldn't help but shake my head in amazement at the people who walked out on such a superlative piece of work.  This is not a commercial Cruise-Kidman film (thankfully).  Marketing has made it appear to be one.  It is a labor of love that will always be looked at through a microscope.The performances are good and I think Kidman may be underused here.  There are some brief moments when the Cruise character reminds you of ""Mitch McDeere"" of THE FIRM  and will figure it all out, but Kubrick fans will know better.  The sinister two-note piano key played throughout the movie goes so well within the foreign New York atmosphere (it was all shot in England) and so many of the great director's trademarks emerge (a bathroom scene, steadicam shots, extraordinary set decoration, gloomy lighting).  The title is a nifty way of naming a film the TV networks would call ""The Misadventures of Dr. Bill"".  They truly are misadventures, but a motive is there.Do yourself a favor and see Stanley Kubrick's farewell stamp to his legendary career.  It is by all means a thriller, with dark thoughts, sexual double-crossing, kinky parties, and all that Kubrickian stuff that never fails to leave you in awe.RATING: ****",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Eye opening journey into a perplexed relationship.,"Stanley Kubrick's final film is far from the mainstream. In spite of pre-release praise, the movie fell short with the critics. Sexually graphic and with a script minus hard censorship, this movie explores a marital relationship that thrives on sex.Tom Cruise plays a doctor, who believes that his lovely wife has been unfaithful. Although it was only a mental fantasy on her part; the doctor goes wandering the streets of New York on a sexually driven quest.Nicole Kidman is ravishing. Not only is she a believable actress; her nude scenes will dare you to blink. Clothed or not, Miss Kidman dominates her scenes.Sydney Pollack was flawless. Julienne Davis deserves applause for most beautiful corpse. WOW!It may take a second or third viewing to absorb this whole odyssey into sexual opportunities.

"Layered, dark fantasy from the maestro Kubrick","I watched ""Eyes Wide Shut"" again last night after first seeing it years ago. Stanley Kubrick's final film is not going to be entertainment for the mass-market audience, who may have been curious about the film's sex scenes based on the trailer set to ""Bad, Bad Thing."" In fact, this film is a surreal, layered, dreamlike exposition on society, social class, marriage, fidelity and truth more than it is about sex, although sexuality, sexual behavior and sexual mores are the prisms through which Kubrick tells this dark fable. In 1999, Tom Cruise was certainly already at the zenith of Hollywood mainstream stardom, so it's interesting that he took this role in order to work with Kubrick, and that Kubrick wanted to cast him as the idealized vision of a square, upstanding, white-bread Manhattan physician devoted to his beautiful, and very bored wife, played by his real-life spouse at the time, Nicole Kidman. I read that Kubrick wanted a real-life couple to explore the darker aspects of married life and sex in the story, and it sounds like he put them through some psychologically painful experiences to elicit the tension required for the two characters. Cruise plays Bill Harford, a man whose ego is absolutely shredded when his wife, Alice, reveals that she wanted to cheat on him the year before. This knowledge leads Bill to embark on a weird night of sexual misadventures that leave him emotionally shattered. Bill is wealthy, handsome and intelligent, but the film shows that he's still a pawn in a decadent, corrupt society where there are far wealthier, far more powerful and manipulative men in charge who use him when it's convenient, and use and discard very beautiful (and frequently naked) women without a fleeing thought for their humanity. ""Eyes Wide Shut"" left me with the impression that there is a light and dark side to life and humanity, and that at certain times, we cross back and forth between them, sometimes with titillation and delight, and sometimes with horror. Cruise's Bill is emotionally emasculated by his wife's desire to cheat and by some of his experiences on his night of wandering through New York's sinister side. It's funny how he keeps showing everyone his New York medical license to be sure everyone knows he's a doctor, so you should trust and respect him! I wonder if Kubrick especially liked the fact that Cruise was a few inches shorter than his wife to highlight his feelings of inadequacy (which neither Bill nor Cruise should have, certainly). I found Alice rather cold, possibly written that way, but it felt believable too, as she seemed like a woman who felt unfulfilled and marginalized in her marriage and life, sort of the stereotype of the wealthy doctor's wife whose husband spends long hours at the clinic instead of with her. She lives in a gilded cage but feels trapped and bored. Kubrick famously used color and lighting to great effect, including scenes shot in blue light and scenes soaked in red. The orgy scene felt rather tame for all the fuss. Maybe Kubrick did not intend for there to be any fuss. I feel that the scene was more a metaphor for class and sexual exploitation in our society. Shame on the MPAA for insisting that CGI people be inserted to partially block the view of some sex scenes. Let adults watch Kubrick's film unedited. I was able to view the unedited version of the sequence online, and there was nothing shocking at all. No need to censor it. The blocked view scenes look awkward.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I Think I'm Disappointed,"This is a difficult film for me to wrap my head around. Stanley Kubrick is unequivocally my favorite director of all time. My two favorite movies (Dr. Strangelove and 2001) are both directed by him and I love most of his films. He is objectively a master of cinema. Having that opinion going into a film can sometimes be problematic. I have to resist the urge of over-analyzing things and treat it like a regular movie. I find it hard to tell what is important in Eyes Wide Shut. Is it the dream vs. reality narrative? Is it the lust? The power of the ultra-rich? Something unseen and unsaid? Or, more likely, a combination of all of these things? There are a few films that are so different than what we're used to that you have to rely on a feeling that what you just watched was special in order to get a grasp on what you think of it. I think 2001 is an example of that but I think Mulholland Dr. is a better example. At the end of both films you basically have no idea what you just watched but, at least in my experience, you're okay with that. You know you're not supposed to get everything. With Eyes Wide Shut I didn't really get that feeling. I went into the film ready to watch something that I would recognize as amazing and ended up let down that I found it to be just alright. I was left with a lot of questions. I think a lot of this feeling can be attributed mainly to a couple of things. One being Nicole Kidman's character. I found too many of her scenes hard to watch. Her slow, monotone dialogue took over nearly every scene she was in and not for the better if you ask me. I understand that it's supposed to be somewhat dream-like but there is just too much of it for my tastes. The other thing that irked me was the theme music. I couldn't help but think that the piano theme was lazy and that is coming from someone who thinks that Kubrick movies have some of the best scores there are. I have a feeling that it was intended to make the viewer uneasy but I wasn't too big a fan of it. Conversely, I thought the framing and lighting were immaculate, as expected. Cinematography is not something you have to worry about with Kubrick. The acting was pretty good, including that of Kidman, I just had a problem with her character. The story was compelling and thought-provoking but that is more due to the source material than the film itself. The liberties that the movie takes with the source material is what has kept me thinking of it for the past few days and I think a film that is on your mind for days after (in a non-negative way) deserves some credit just for that. I am about as confused as I've been after watching a movie and I have a feeling that my qualms were intended but at this point they are mostly lost on me. The film is often thought of as misunderstood and I probably agree but, at this point in time, I don't find it to be a masterpiece.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of my favourite movie,"We'll never know for sure if Stanley Kubrick was proud of it or not, but I wish he was, because he should. You know, when you are watching a movie and you feel like you're in suspension for 2 hours? One of these movies that puts you in a weird place, but you are so captivated that you can't stop watching for reasons that you can't explain yourself? I don't want to spoil anything so just let me tell you that it's one of these movie that you will love or you will hate. It's not fast pace and it's a complex story. I read the book and even though Kubrick stick to pretty much all of it, I must say that the movie is far more interesting than the book (have you ever heard that? Ever?)",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
ho hum,"At first I got glimpses of how I felt watching Blue Velvet when I was young and it was new....the titillation of the underworld with a possibly corrupted sexual element.But by the end, this seemed more of a Fatal Attraction like movie...where a man lives out a male fantasy and it comes back to bite him. In Fatal Attraction it was the affair, in this case it was getting revenge on his wife for having a fantasy life. So the good doctor goes on a series of revenge adventures. Not just the party but also the friendly neighbourhood sex worker.At the very end we were gifted the dialogue where we were informed that the theme was that snippets of real life and snippets of dream life are neither the whole truth nor not the truth at all. Well thanks for that. It might have made more sense to build that theme up.The big take away from this film is how ridiculous it is that Western society has laws against women going topless. This movie insisted on showing naked boobies left right and centre. But women aren't allowed to take their tops off on a hot day like a man is. Only where men decide it is allowed outside the home such as porn and R-rated movies. Men have nipples and fatter men get actual breasts. So why can they show them and women can't? There is no excuse for such a law. I mean who would be offended? Not the men who make the laws, not women, and certainly not the children who BREAST FEED. In fact I howl at those that find religions that have women cover their hair as sexist and backward. There is no difference to making women put on a top. Why am I bringing that up? There was something about this movie that used naked breasts to make some sort of point, to drive that home. The breasts are there to signal something to men. It was very lame symbolism but I think it was attempting to show forbidden fruit? And based on the comments by people who felt cheated that the nudity and sexuality (two different things) wasn't as advertised.So it was a weak movie. The message was shallow and we had to be told it at the end rather than have it be shown. I think my 6 rating is overly generous.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A love-hate relationship,"After watching Eyes Wide Shut (EWS) I found myself extremely divided over how to properly evaluate it.Let me start by looking at what I consider EWS's strong points.Aesthetically EWS is a stunning film. Kubrick's signature tracking shots and creative use of colour and imagery make for many memorable scenes. Lots of symbolism is employed, such as the sexually charged paintings, and of course the wide assortment of masks and costumes. The soundtrack is also perfectly suited to the atmosphere of each scene. The use of a slow but rising piano beat is particularly effective at conveying the mystery and uncertainty that Tom's Cruise's character finds himself in and I found myself replaying it in my head for a long time after my first viewing.Now for the not so good.My biggest gripe with EWS is its often painfully slow pacing. Like 2001: A Space Odyssey, EWS has very little actual dialogue, instead relying largely on imagery to guide you through the journey. The problem is that what dialogue there is is not very interesting or relevant. Why does Tom Cruise's character have to repeat every bloody thing that others tell him? This combined with the at times agonizingly slow delivery of the lines frustrated the **** out of me. I can understand what Kubrick was going for (a dreamlike surreal atmosphere) but he fails to sell it clearly and convincingly enough, and the end result is tediousness rather than suspense.Honestly this is a real love hate relationship for me. EWS does grow on you a bit with repeated viewings; still a lot of people will likely be turned off by the pacing. The film is still better than a lot of what's out there, and is definitely worth a look for fans of Kubrick's other work. Overall though, I felt it was one of his weaker efforts.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

......but keep your mind wide open.,"There's a scene in Kubrick's final film, Eyes Wide Shut, in which the lead feels he is being followed by an unruly and somewhat antagonistic force down a public street. The setting is the night; the location is a usually bustling city and the happenings within the frame capture what's at stake for these people. A certain Dr. William Harford (Cruise) stands by a stand selling items; his surveyor at the end of the street, keeping a watchful eye on the good doctor, whilst himself perched between two very distinct locales: a large, welcoming restaurant and a sex shop displaying the latest in lingerie. In a very basic sense, and given what Harford knows at this point about the stalker, the two locales the follower stands between represent Harford's predicament: carrying on with what you're doing and keeping quiet equates in being able to carry on in life, best represented by the restaurant offering food, or 'life' - indeed salvation. The alternative is the sex shop across the road, the option to quash one's guilt about what happened at the mansion and spill the beans on what he saw and was told would happen. We are led that the repercussions, however, would equate in pain for William and his family; possibly even death.In one sequence lasting about fifteen seconds but running on some previous material, the film manages to touch on ideas of guilt and sex as a weapon or as a piece of blackmail whilst incorporating a certain sense of horror and adding to what was, up to this point, feeling like a suburban drama of some description. The brief shift in mood has us momentarily frightened, that a force we were not expecting in this 'type' of film does indeed exist, and possesses an ability to harm. Kubrick's final film, 1999's Eyes Wide Shut, seems to be a mediation on sexuality and the urge to further sexual ventures. Like Polanski's Bitter Moon before it, the film is about a male lead attempting to further his sexual horizons; with the hitch that he is running on ego and lust more-so a slower and more natural sensation which demands he should try new things in his own time.William has a wife named Alice (Kidman), and they have one very young daughter. They dress extravagantly, play classical music as they get ready for nights out and they attend functions that embrace public holidays and display works of art, all in the metropolis that is New York City. I'm not sure if saying that the film ""isn't really about them as a couple"" is entirely correct, although you will not come away from the film with the nourishing sense of accomplishment born out of their relationship-come-marriage. Essentially, the film is a circular journey for Bill; beginning and immediately ending with head on and frank interaction with his wife. More-so for me, the film is purely about the male, in this case the husband, Bill. The spark that lights his fuse and refrains it from burning out is talk with Alice about how she once felt for a Naval officer many years ago, something that is intensified when his conflicting feelings clash following a call-out to a patients house. Prior to hearing Alice's story, Bill actively flirts with two young models at the function whereas at the home of a woman's dead father, post-conversation, Bill talks and interacts with said woman but turns down any advances.For all the shops selling lingerie; the naked lead characters and for all the nudity and fetishistic animal masks that come with that particular segment, the film is exceedingly un-erotic or 'un-titalating'. Why? Because there is a certain danger linked to these things: the already established sex shop is iconographically on one 'side' of the road in which the lead could cross, but it would spell disaster; the naked women lying motionless in a recreational room is there because of a drug overdose while the outrageous sequence of several naked bodies wandering around a large house and having intercourse over a soundtrack of odd chanting instills fear more than anything else born out of the fact that we, the lead character, should not be there – and are in grave danger.Bill's further descent is emphasised when a group of young men call into question his sexuality, accusing him of looking like a homosexual and when his stumbling into a jazz club and an interaction with a musician he's known of for years going back to medical school prods things along, there's no going back upon hearing of a strange place in which strange goings on occur. The film works well and stands up to Kubrick's prior work, with the entire de-robing sequence being able to be placed on that mantle with any other 'out there' sequence from Kubrick's work: scenes such as Slim Pickens' riding of the atomic bomb and the visionary sequence in 2001: A Space Odyssey as the lead journeys to where only very few, if any, have ever been before.Eyes Wide Shut is an accomplished film; a piece that carries dramatic weight and retains its focus and guile. The film is frightening, but it is the nature of human beings that scares us the most in the picture; and those with such carefree attitudes to sexual goings on around them: the owner of a clothes shop regarding what he can do with his daughter and a certain Victor Ziegler (Pollack), who knows why naked women got to be how they are at his place but shows no real compassion to them: they are to be used and disregarded if they step out of line. This was certainly no shameful departure for Kubrick.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Kubrick rattles off another genre in close look upon sexual desire,"After his wife's confession of lust towards another man, Doctor Will Harford (Cruise) sets out on a voyage of sexual desires and adventures.Stanley Kubrick had certainly made a name for himself over the past few decades, ticking off genres with some splendid direction and filming that rattled cages and drew hefty debates amongst many critiques. He mastered the horror with The Shining, the sci-fi with 2001 and many others right up until this, where he aimed to tick the romance genre off his list. Sadly the American died shortly after presenting this to the distributer and so 10 years on, it is comforting to know he achieved something remarkable in the genre.Eyes Wide Shut is debated as one of Kubrick's worst pictures. From the upside down sequence in 2001 to the blood flowing elevator montage in The Shining, Kubrick was artistically driven, a perfectionist and this is, apparently, where he falls short in the 1999 release. There are no wondrous experimentations, minimal elaborate scene stealing montages or anything otherwise to suggest it is the same person who directed numerous Oscar nominated pictures. So this would presumably be the reason for the critical analysis, but the absence of the camera doesn't dissolve any promise or prospect from the film. Actually, the lack of sweeping scenes brings the film right down to earth.The story is after all a love story, a mature look upon a married couples lives with the use of drugs, sex and parenting to bring a strong level of realistic lifestyle to the picture. The scripting therefore requires little elaboration. There are many consistent montages with the couple, the close up of Kidman's confession is well executed by the director and one fine scene appears when Cruise enters the burlesque house. The sweeping smart approach to the masked personas is very well handled and the sharp music helps generate a feeling of chills and intensity.The whole sex concept is a highly interesting look upon human sexuality and desire, a depiction of lust, trust and intrigue. This is consistently debated throughout, and worth hanging on to right to the question raising climax.The music score is not on the level of say 2001 but it fits the mood of the script nicely. The strong piano strikes may infuriate edgy viewers but do settle the story into a state of intensity and drama.Cruise gives yet another strong performance as the likable Doctor but Kidman is so infuriatingly boring you may look away. The drug taking sequence is a brave attempt to spice her stereotype up, but is driven way out of proportion.Like all Kubrick pictures, there is a great mystery to solve come the end of the film, and just like Kubrick, he has rattled off another genre with a fine justification of romance.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Genre Mishmash at its finest,"One of the finest genre mishmashes out there.

This movie is NOT about sex!,"Kubrick's last film has been getting some unjustified negative press (slow, ill-matched mix of ponderous and comic, Cruise can't act, etc). There are some inconsistencies in editing, color quality, sound mix, but these don't take away much from one of the defining American films of the decade. Biggest complaint seems to be that the sex isn't very, well, sexy. But when was the last time Kubrick made a movie in which sex was fun (A Clockwork Orange? George C. Scott and his girlfriend at the beginning of Dr. Strangelove?)? And anyway, sex isn't what EWS (or any other Kubrick film) is about. Like Schnitzler's novel, it's really about the deeper insecurities of a young couple on their way up the social ladder. They had such people in turn-of-the-century Vienna, too, which is why this was such good material for an update to the nouveau riche '90s, especially for a cold fish like ol' Stanley.Schnitzler wrote about bourgeois up-and-comers fascinated and repelled by the decadent world of the aristocracy - however real or imaginary that decadence turned out to be. Same thing here - our young couple don't know why the mysterious Victor keeps inviting them to his Christmas parties, but they're dazzled and drawn into his world, which makes theirs look suddenly boring. Tom and Nicole, with their unshakeable image as Hollywood's young naifs, are perfectly cast. And it doesn't matter that their performances aren't especially impressive: Cruise, who reacts to everything with the same clenched, defensive grin, IS Bill Harford, the doctor out of his depth in the weird world of the super-rich. Kubrick wickedly uses the truths and rumors about these two stars to add dimensions to the film, even throwing in a scene where a bunch of frat-kids gay-bash Bill.Wife Alice's fascination confines itself to her dreams; husband goes out on the town. He doesn't have sex with the hooker who picks him up, because sex isn't really what he's after -- it's adventure, something to take him out of his narrow existence. What's all that money he's making for, anyway?Sure, the much-derided orgy-in-a-mansion scene is ludicrous, but it's probably just the kind of fantasy a guy like Bill Harford would dream up if you asked him to think decadent. (What's dream and what's reality? consider that the one-night stand that's Alice's fantasy is pretty tame compared to what Bill ""actually"" sees - yet he didn't have sex, and in her dream, she does.) Think of it as wish-fulfillment: Bill gets exactly the kind of outre experience he was looking for, and in the end gets exactly the lesson he probably knew was coming all along: don't meddle with things you don't understand. The ending confirms one of the defining truths about the middle class of either 1900 or the 1990s: that when confronted with such advice, they will take it, circle the wagons, defend their immediate material world, and let the mysterious remain the mysterious. Yes, life is elsewhere; it'll just have to stay there. The title is perfect: Eyes wide open - but only for an instant. Then shut tight again, probably for good. Fine film, and a most timely note on which to end an extraordinary moviemaking career.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Kubrick's Final Masterpiece,"""Eyes Wide Shut"" is one of the best Christmas movies of all time! But, it isn't a movie for the whole family to get together and watch next to a warm campfire on a snowy Christmas Eve. In fact, it barley has anything to do with Christmas, it just seem to take place around the holiday. But, it is an excellent film nonetheless.Starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, this is a psychological thriller from master director Stanley Kubrick. It is both Kubrick's final film, and one of his absolute greatest, using elements of drama, horror, mystery, and, even really dark comedy. It is a masterful film on every level, with great acting, plot, and filmmaking.The strange cult sequence is definitely the highlight. It has a horribly nightmarish feel to it, especially because of the eerie score and set up.

A rather disappointing last film of Kubrick.,"""Eyes wide shut"" is a film about a nocturnal sexual odyssey, inititiated by the confession of mental adultry by the wife of the main character.It illustrates the opinion of many men of having exclusive rights on or being the only gender susceptible to erotic temptations. They are shocked when a woman (their woman!) apparently is not immune either.We see this in ""Vredens dag"" (1943, Carl Theodor Dreyer) when an older man really beliefs he can give a young girl all that she wants. We see it also in ""Eyes wide shut"" when the man of a young couple really thinks that his wife has to worry about the beautiful girls flirting with him at a party but not vice versa because women are naturally inclined to fidelity.At the end of the sexual odyssey the man is converted to a monogamous relationship. This ending gives the film a little moralistic aftertaste. All in all a rather disappointing last film of Kubrick.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Haunting, brilliant requiem by one of the masters","I'm still in shock after seeing ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" a haunting masterpiece of a film written, directed, and produced by one of film's great artists, Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick died just five days after showing his film, suggested by Arthur Schnitzler's novel ""Traumnovelle,"" to Warner Bros. Thankfully, the studio has left most of Kubrick's vision intact, reportedly interfering with but a single scene. ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is sexy, emotional, thrilling, and sickening - and brilliant. During the filming, which took over a year, the cast and crew were sworn to secrecy. Speculation and rumors ran wild about the husband-and-wife team of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman: would there be a steamy sex scene? Or, even more intriguing: would we see Tom naked? All anyone really knew was that this was a sexy thriller, a la ""Basic Instinct."" An early rumor I heard was that Kubrick decided to shoot a porno movie using well-known actors and a good script. Well, forget anything you may have heard before - you're in for a shock.Put simply, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is not really about sex. Not that it isn't erotic - nearly every scene is alive with sexual energy - but there's a bigger game at stake than just the one played horizontally. This is a film about power, and the loss of power that comes with sexual situations. Tom Cruise, who plays Dr. Bill Harford, is disturbed when his wife Alice (played beautifully by Nicole Kidman) confesses having sexual thoughts about another man. Perhaps part revenge, part curiosity, he sets out on an odyssey to be unfaithful - but somehow, never succeeds. One is reminded of those characters in Greek mythology who were given the impossible tasks in Hades; one had to fill up a bucket with no bottom, and one had to constantly push a rock uphill that would always roll back down to the bottom. Dr. Harford is a man without power who nevertheless requires it - in most situations, his credentials give him power, but he discovers there are certain people he cannot impress simply by flashing his board card.One of these people is his wife - time and again, she takes the upper hand in their relationship. As Bill stumbles haplessly about New York, visions of Alice's infidelity flash through his mind. Much of his odyssey seems to stem from a ""This'll show her!"" mindset rather than the cool, rational façade he wants us to see. In fact, nearly all of Bill's actions seem impulsive - from his decision to visit a whore's bedroom to his chance meeting with an old friend at a piano bar to the drive to the infamous manor house where the film's climax occurs. Dr. Harford is unable to exude power here, in the company of an exclusive group of lechers and courtesans. He is seen instantly as an imposter, and the message is clear: Only the powerful need remain.The specifics of the plot are not nearly as important as the film's ultimate message. Suffice to say, there is intrigue, murder, sex, drugs, and suspicion enough to keep even the most jaded moviegoer interested and guessing until the final scene. And, in keeping with the rest of the film, Cruise's character is not allowed to emerge victorious in the final reel - it is Alice who ultimately shows her strength and power, not Bill. ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" as its title may imply, is full of ironies both large and small: the main character is an anti-hero, his every success doomed from the opening credits; a hooker has sociology textbooks on view in her apartment; a junkie and whore sacrifices herself to save another. What makes this movie so intriguing is that every scene, every moment captured on film, is so carefully constructed that we get the feeling we are standing just behind Bill, observing his tragic fall and even being drawn down with him.""Eyes Wide Shut"" is an outstanding film, one that will be surely recognized by the Academy Awards. I would be very surprised indeed if Kubrick were not nominated posthumously for Best Director. In addition, it is rare indeed for a major studio release starring big-name stars to be an art film - and ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a work of art. Every light, every mask, every character - all come together in a stunning array of beauty, shock, and wisdom that makes me realize what a tragic loss Mr. Kubrick's death was. I've often said that Stanley Kubrick never made a bad film, and ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is no exception. Disturbing, haunting, and shocking, it is also a beautiful, emotional, and masterful requiem by one of the great masters.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
9 Year Itch,"I looked at the reviews on here before watching this and oh my, how wrong most people are.Some are dismissing it as rubbish and others are pretending they are not looking at it as a sex film and pretend they know about its psychology and art, they looking too deeply into it and rating it higher than it deserves when really they are just getting off on the naked women in it. And what they say about it is mostly fantasy (not the sexual fantasy in the movie) but a fantasy that is in their own minds.This film is not about sexual fantasy's at all, it is a porno dressed up as a drama come thriller, about a married couple coming to a point in their relationship where its got a bit stale and it needed something like this to sort themselves out, a bit like a 7 year itch (in this case they are married for 9 years), the problem was that they were too truthful with each other. She had a sex fantasy after being ""hit on"" at a party and when she told him he decided to try a bit himself, there's nothing dark or mysterious about it, with some people it happens. But they have added a lot of nakedness to spice it up a bit.The movie started out as a drama, and turned into a kind of thriller, after Cruise stumbled upon an orgy involving high up people who did not want it to be found out, but nothing too serious, they just wanted to (and succeeded) scare him off.The acting from Cruise and Kidman was very good, the cameo by the noted Director Sydney Pollak was also good, the few supporting actors were ok, you did not see a lot of them because many had masks on. Direction was average, Stanley Kubrick was on his last film, and although he has made some good films, he has also made some poor ones, this is about middle for him. The music was a bit dreary though and it moved too slow, some of the dialogue was very slow, not like real, it was trying to be over dramatic. It is 2hr 40 mins in length and was too long, it was a bit boring most of the time, they could have shortened it without losing much and it would have been better, or they could have put more in, made the thriller part a bit more thrilling with more intrigue and a bit of action, just a bit and it would have been ok for the length.Personally I believe many of the High rated reviews are because they are repressed sex pests and were just excited to see a few sexy female bodies, and did not see much else, because they were inaccurate about some of the details. Maybe its why they made it like that to attract the perverts? Another thing I noticed was that you hardly saw any naked men (blurred in distance) and all the women on this film are tall, blonde and leggy, and almost all are stripping off with good views of their bums, is this a Stanley Kubrick fetish ? Did he make this film just so he could masturbate over his favourite type of woman ? Was he a Harvey Weinstein type ?I gave it a 6 for the intrigue and good acting, if a bit shorter or more exciting, or not for the porn angle it would have been higher.I am pretty sure that the perverts who pretend it is stylistic will diss me for my comments, it's because they don't like it when someone points out the obvious.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I can't believe it's not nominated for 1999's best film!,"Eyes Wide Shut was the last Kubrick masterpiece (his last film, in other words). We can say his carreer (and life) ended in a nice way (without being mean). This film is amazing, mysterious, very well acted and extremely well directed! I can't understand why it is not nominated for last year's best movie! I thought this one was better than American Beauty, which was my favorite of last year before seeing Eyes Wide Shut (but I didn't see Man On The Moon). I guess the Academy couldn't nominate it because it was ''too hot for Oscar''. This is not the best Kubrick film (with films like 2001:A Space Odyssey, Dr.Strangelove, The Shining, Full Metal Jacket and Clockwork Orange, it's pretty hard to do better than all of these!!!!!) but it worth watching! When I told people I wanted to see Eyes Wide shut, they said ''I wonder why!'' but they were wrong...when you watch this film, go further than watching the nudity and fast-forwarding the rest of the film...if you do so, you won't like the film. I am a big fan of Kubrick movies and I was very interested in the whole film. It was mysterious, the atmosphere was very enjoyable. Kubrick made a kind of mix of his films (Lolita, Clockwork Orange and even The Shining!!!). A must-see! the ending was like the ending of the other Kubrick films, surprising, intelligent and appropriate. I loved it. I give it 90%.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Fidelio,"Eyes Wide Shut goes beyond being just a marriage drama or a film about sexuality. Kubrick questions social structures and power dynamics with references to secret societies and the Illuminati in the film. The themes of masquerade and anonymity emphasize the influence of individuals and elites on society. Kubrick's film remains a production that invites the audience to be aware of social hierarchies and hidden power structures. The film engages in a deep reckoning not only with individual relationships but also with broader social structures.Eyes Wide Shut, similar to Kubrick's previous films, has a structure full of symbols that transcends the surface story. The film questions how dark forces and secret societies function as elements that shape social structure. It also offers a critique of how these secret societies manipulate sexuality, loyalty and power. Kubrick creates both psychological tension and social criticism in the film by revealing the ""hidden"" face of society and the powerlessness of individuals in the face of these structures.In conclusion, Eyes Wide Shut is not just a film about marriage or sexuality, but also a production that questions the impact of hidden power structures on society and how these structures are shaped by unseen hands. Kubrick's masterful atmosphere and symbols invite the viewer to be aware not only of individual relationships but also of social power dynamics.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Perfect Title,"This film's title is PERFECT.  Eyes Wide Shut.  I cannot think of anything more clever, intriguing or fitting.

Watch it again (and again),"If you don't understand why this film is on par with Kubrick's best, I strongly recommend you watch it over and over until you get it. Rob Ager's wonderful analysis, parts of which can be found on YouTube (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj7Hw6OnbH8), will clue you in as to why you owe it to yourself to do so.In my opinion  and 2001 is the greatest film I have ever seen  Eyes Wide Shut is on the level of 2001 in terms of its calling us to question the nature of our humanity. The dumbstruck critical reaction to EWS was not due simply to some botched marketing campaign  although expectations of some kind of soft-core porn will surely leave you disappointed if you can't shake that preconception. Rather, the underrating of EWS is a factor of one's viewing the film as a film. It is decidedly beyond just a film. It is a laser beam through your third eye. It is a journey down into the rotting bowels of your subconscious.Certainly, and perhaps particularly if you are an American, parts of it should make you very disgusted with yourself. Whether there is some redemption in EWS is up to you, but I don't think there is. On the surface of the film we are shown how venal transactions and the objectification of women cut through all strata of society, varying only in the level of grotesque and willful disregard for the human soul. We see an idle rich aspirant get a wake-up call about his place in society. We see a married couple come clean about their dark fantasies and ambivalence. But this is truly just the beginning. Once the phone rings in the Harfords' bedroom, the real voyage begins  in us, through Bill Harford's adventures (be they real, a vision of the collective unconscious, or a lucid dream somehow unfolding in real time in both husband and wife).In EWS, the questions we are urged to ask ourselves relate more to our fears and desires and the foundations of society as opposed to our evolutionary history and trajectory. However, nearly every shot in EWS is so saturated with images, objects, penetrating (if sometimes sparse) dialogue, inside jokes, etc., that I would argue that with respect to set design and mise en scene, and even costuming, it trumps 2001. I can only imagine trying to catch all of what is going on by watching the film in slow motion. Just try to keep up with the textual objects in the film (e.g. signs) and you'll have to be on your toes! If it is true that the studio edited Kubrick's final cut, or that he did not have time to ""polish"" his final work, then this is truly a shame. Yet, the film remains a masterpiece. I hope someday it will be able to be seen in whatever version Stanley intended, because not only does EWS turn a mirror onto ourselves, but it allows, as do his films in general, a fearless and honest glimpse into the very heart and soul of one of the greatest artists of the 20th century.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Lessen Nicole Kidman's role, and this would've been great.","This film seemed to be composed of two parts. The first had Nicole Kidman seemingly in the picture simply for eye candy. The second, much more interesting storyline had Tom Cruise, and the mystery of the house. Trim Nicole Kidman's part drastically, or better yet cut her out of the film entirely, and this film has the potential to be great. Not to mention it would have been a much needed forty-five minutes shorter. The scenes in the house, while strong for some viewers, is not actually as scandalous as I was expecting from what I'd heard through word of mouth. In fact the only parts of the movie which were offensive to me where the dream sequences which featured Nicole Kidman and the nameless sailor. I found myself wondering what caused her to make such a poor choice in career judgement. The party at the beginning in which she danced with the Hungarian, was uneccessary, and entirely too long. Cut the whole thing. Make Tom Cruise single, or at least make his married life not quite so drawn out, maybe even give Nicole Kidman some intelligent, brief dialogue to deliver, and this would have been in the eight or nine category, instead of a slightly above average 6, for a good idea, which was off by one performance.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It just has a certain something,"As an aspiring filmmaker, I've often dissected movies to see what makes them great. Other times I'll watch a movie, know that it's great, but can't form a sentence to say why I have such thoughts. Eyes Wide Shut is one of those movies where I can both dissect it and other times I can just let it move me. And since I've already written a cerebral review before, I'll stick to the emotions for this one.I think the fact that of any movie I've ever reviewed this movie alone has made me want to make two separate reviews tells me something about the power it has. I could go on for hours about what I thought made it great, but I already did that in the other review. I wrote that review after seeing the movie once. Here is how I felt after seeing it twice:Thank god for directors like Kubrick. I was so glad to see a movie that had a different pacing than most movies today. The movie took its time to unfold and in the end, even if every single incident isn't examined, it helps to create atmosphere. It helped draw me into the film. The vivid imagery and odd happenings were then more acceptable. I viewed certain events with humor, with apprehension, with interest, but never with disbelief.The acting was dead-on target. I think Kidman deserved an academy award simply for her speech about infidelity. She also plays an inebriated woman quite well. Too bad her role became smaller as Cruise's got bigger. And Cruise was perfect as a normally rational man who internalizes his feelings and is suddenly given information that he does not know how to deal with. He made me believe that what he was going through was genuine and often quite painful.And, in the end, I think I really love this movie because when I see it I get a feeling deep in my gut. This feeling can't be explained, but I get the feeling when I watch something that is, in my opinion, a truly great piece of cinema. It's that feeling that inspires me. It's what makes me aspire to be a filmmaker. And the fact that I get it when I watch Eyes Wide Shut tells me that even if it's misunderstood, even if there is nothing to understand, Kubrick's final film was one of tremendous importance and validity.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Just a Big Tease,"Kubrick's swan song is extremely crafted porn to tease the male audience, by letting nothing keep happening to male protagonist Tom Cruise and not revealing the details clearly at the masquerade orgy in a remote mansion. The setting is a big tease by itself, as the audience, who may identify themselves with pedestrian bourgeois Cruise, can only imagine if the story could be real or not. The empty film with the gorgeous outlook may be appropriate to conclude Kubrick's career, as he had perfected most of his works with various materials in a randomly wide range, which are sometimes meaningful and sometimes not.Technical note: The editor used a lot of long cross-dissolves, which are strongly annoying. I assume and hope it was not Kubrick's intention.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Aha I thought, the seeds of the plot are being sown - beautiful wife, taken for granted by her busy husband, the movie will explore their sexuality. But no. It was more 'Hammer meets Emmanuele'. This film is *awful*. Terrible plot, bad acting - even the picture and sound quality were bad. Kubrick must have needed to money. And Cruise and Kidman must have felt like making a dirty film together (not an uncommon thing for married couples to do). Even the sex was bad. I fell asleep during the orgy scene. How could this movie get in the IMDB's Top 250? I gave it 1/10 because Nicole Kidman is beautiful.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A mesmerizing psychological thriller and Kubrick's most underrated film,"Sadly, Stanley Kubrick died before the commercial release of his most underrated film. Eyes Wide Shut is a surrealistic mystery tale, a creepy thriller full of amazing scenes and rich colours.Tom Cruise gives a great performance (almost unrecognizable) as Dr. Bill Harford. Cruise has incredible acting chops and shows it all in this film. Fear, curiosity, anger and many more. Along with Cruise is Nicole Kidman as Alice, Bill's wife. Nicole shines in her scenes and especially in the scene with her confession.Despite being promoted as a steamy, erotic thriller with Cruise and Kidman ""getting it on"", it is not at all erotic. The infamous orgy scene, even though it has strong sex, is more mysterious and disturbing instead of erotic. And yes, this is a better thing.I think the reason it isn't as popular as it should be is because of the false advertising. Hopefully, this underrated masterpiece will be recognized in the future as it is a beautifully shot, creepy psychological thriller and a great end to a very great artist.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Kubrick's Curtain Call and one of the Very Few Films to Change My Life,"Kubrick's film career is quite an impressive one. He can do no wrong. Every single movie he has made has gotten largely positive reviews and now withstand the test of time. Even if one of his movies meets with mixed reviews, it later goes on to get largely positive reviews later (The Shining is a prime example). Kubrick has contributed to nearly every genre of film, even comedy (Dr. Strangelove). Now let's talk about Eyes Wide Shut.This film is often regarded as Kubrick's one mistake. I say otherwise. While I will agree that the film was very long and some scenes were unbearably slow (take the final scene with Tom Cruise and Sydney Pollack for example), the film has some very sincere messages about sexual jealousy, and what it truly means to be committed, the directing is absolutely brilliant, the writing is tremendous. As for the acting, they probably could've done better.Now one thing that I want to bring up is the controversy over the film's erotic content. Yes, the film is erotic and contains some sex and nudity, it is an erotic movie. However, it is NOT meant to titillate or arouse. The film suffered from a very bad marketing campaign that implied that the film was a sexual exploitation film. This film is sorely misunderstood.This film actually helped strengthen my relationships and really affected me emotionally, and mentally. I actually felt myself become wiser because of this movie.Bottom Line: I believe that, if you love Kubrick films, and can sit through a 2 and a 1/2 hour film with a bit of jabber, you will enjoy Kubrick's final masterpiece.**** and a half out of *****",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"The best movie of 1999, and one of the best ever.","This movie has the sort of mystical, Baroque atmosphere that all of Kubrick's other films have. The feeling left after watching is lasting and strong; no interpretation is pushed on the viewer, and like all great works of art, no petty activist's dogma, moral point, or ""lesson"" exists in this work. The subtlety and lush malevolence of the material is probably the cause of its surprising lack of popularity with critics, who, were very quick to try and show how smart they are and maliciously jumped on it, writing some really bad--as in badly written and thought-out--reviews in the process.In my opinion this is one of Kubrick's best movies and one of the best movies ever.",,Anonymous,Mystery

What if the movie had been completed?,"There's no other movie that has been so generously awarded before its premier! Years of headlines about Kubrick, Cruise and Kidman this and that, sex, body doubles, takes and re-re-re-re-re-retakes,hype after hype and finally, Kubrick's death. Which seems like an excuse for leaving the film as it appears. Mediocre. Skeletal. Uncut. Most and foremost: uncut. During the first half an hour I got irritated about the dialogue: - How do ..........you........think about.........that? - ..........How do.........I...........think about..........that? Wellll...... how I.....think about that izzzzz......eehhhh....This is really difficult for me to say....but.....and so on. Kubrick forced his actors act naturally, to act and react, but I don't think all of this slow thinking was meant to appear in the final version. I havent really done any research, but I suppose one third or fourth of the movie could easily have been left out. Of course, the movie would have felt unfinished then, and not the Last Will and Testament of the God.The erotic aspect is OK, but not erotic. Asses and tits come and go, but are more like sculptures. White gypsum copies of the original marble artwork of the antiques. No insight, really. We know that Kubrick didn't actually fool around, meet people, or stay tuned with the world. It shows.The approach is very theatre-like. I actually lost my concentration thinking about how much of the dialogue is Schnitzler and how much isn't. Especially the slimy and sleazy Hungarian, who would very much have wanted to f**k Nicole Kidman, acted nothing like a turn-of-the-millennium-c**t-licking playboy would. Maybe Kubrick thought nothing has changed since the times of the original story.Very sorry. I think Stanley Kubrick was one of the greatest. Eyes Wide Shut is beautifully shot (in Lightbulb Yellow and Nuit Americaine Blue), has a driving screenplay and a genuine no-hurry Kubrick feel, but I still think it's nowhere close to what it would have been, if the director could have worked on it for another five years.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Stands up to every Kubrick fan's expectations.,"When compared to such films as Dr. Strangelove, The Shining, or Full Metal Jacket, Eyes Wide Shut has some great shoes to fill.  Yet, it manages to meet every possible expectation, and then some.  It starts with Dr. Bill Harford, played by Tom Cruise, and his wife Alice Harford, played by Nicole Kidman at an expensive party given by one of their friends.  Each are properly being pursued by attractive members of the opposite sex.  In a later discussion of such matters by the bed, and with a little help from some narcotics, an argument breaks out surrounding the tense subject of sexual fantasy and infidelity.  Upset, by this new information, Bill is exposed to many new and dangerous sexual encounters.  Kubrick takes full artistic license when using a very grainy film stock which gives the film a classic and almost warm feeling.  But once things get a little harry, his tight close ups and slow zooming in adds to the uncomfortable feelings presented on the screen.  Kubrick also uses spectacular lighting, and the sound of a solo piano to deeply intensify every uncomfortable situation. Eyes Wide Shut, though dealing with sexual subject manor, is handled professionally, with a touch of Kubrick just to make everything absolutely perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

From beginning to end the whole movie happens in a dream-like state of trans where the characters go through a set of bizarre experiences and desires only to be unsure if they are awake or asleep at the end of it all.Like all Kubrick's films, this one contains a very powerful theme and message and certainly, movies like that will not be made today. This movie is not for everyone; some will enjoy it today, others may enjoy it 10 years from now.This is one of those films that will leave you thinking for days and weeks and I might still discover more things that I like about it 5 or 10 years from now.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Dream-like sexual weirdness,"Stanley Kubrick's last film before his death. A film that blurs the borders of dreaming and challenges us to question the differences between reality, dreams, fantasies and nightmares. Sometimes it's just as weird to be awake as it is to dream.Dr. William Harford - played brilliant here by Tom Cruise in a role that might very well be the best he has ever done - flees from his house after hearing a jarring confession from his wife. And thus begins the long night that would haunt him forever.What makes this film so perfect is Kubrick's vision. The pace is so agonizingly slow, the plot so nonsensical, that had it not had one of the best directors of all time at the steering wheel, it would fallen straight to that pile of artsy borefests that only film majors ever watch. But it doesn't. Yes, it's slow, yes it makes no sense whatsoever, but yet it works. I remember glancing at the clock after the film had been going on for a while and I remember asking ""Has it really been two hours already?"" Because it didn't feel like it had. The film is hypnotizing. It pulls you in and as Harford wanders around New York, you remain strangely calm about the whole situation. You don't question, why was that character there, why did that scene happen. It just does, it's cool.Part of that calmness comes from the technical side of this film. Kubrick didn't want to use any studio lighting, so instead the crew relied mostly on the various Christmas decorations that they places strategically all over the sets. This gives the film a slightly blurred, soft and ethereal quality, not unlike if you were dreaming the whole time. The soundtrack is also amazingly powerful, underlining each scene with a heavy hand, but never in a way that feels forced. One of the few films where I noticed the sound cues and didn't hate them.I already praised Tom Cruise, but it's also worth noticing that despite this film having huge piles of gratuitous nudity, despite the infamous orgy scene, despite all these weird sexual situations Harford finds himself in, the sexiest thing in the entire film is his wife (Nicole Kidman) leaning against the doorframe in her nightclothes or peering over her glasses. That's talent on Kidman's part and the fact is helped alone by her and Cruise's marriage at the time. They have fantastic chemistry together and Kidman provides us with the needed reality and anchorage.Pretty much the only thing keeping this film from becoming one of my personal favourites is the fact that the ending drags. Not a huge amount, but it does. At that point the musical cues have begun to grow on your nerves, the slow scenes have slipped back into being agonizing and you just want the film to give you its final words and leave you to ponder its mysteries. Instead we get one final conversation before the ending scene between Cruise and Kidman. It doesn't ruin the film for me, but it's a shame that such a great film falters just before the finish line.Still, it's an amazing film. Heavily sexual, but not in a sexy way, it's a journey like you've never taken before. Riddled with phenomenal acting performances, with fantastic production values, ironhand directing and unforgettable scenes, it's a film you're going to remember. May it haunt your fantasies and deepest nightmares.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Kubrick's Last Laugh,"When humans dream their logic system goes to sleep and things become disjointed and illogical. Visions that are threatening and inviting or are stalking or are just plain illogical and unconnected are dominant throughout our dreams and throughout this film. Like a dream the film starts at night and ends in the morning. All the characters are shallow-layered. Now keep an eye on the word shallow-layered because there is hidden meaning to that. Involved relationships are quite layered like an onion with very fine texture that has moods that can shift and spin around in an instant. Moods are constantly shifting around in this film.No place is there a relationship like one wishes with a cashier at a grocery store where one can bring the goods, plump down the money and just leave. Those can be humans' wishes but even at the cashier they wind up being more involved with layers that build up tensions and shifting moods.Kubrick uses sexual images only as a decoy. These ""masks"" make the audience chase after the wrong area, carrying their own delusions. Even the smoking of dope by Kidman and Cruise is a part of the mask. Humans are never more self-deceiving than when they are either high on dope or drunk.In most all of the scenes the backdrops keep changing just like a magician has his assistants constantly doing the dirty work while his moves are only misleading deceptions.There is a mail pickup box with a distinct gang tagging on it in this film. The trouble is that it shows up in 3 places as if it had legs. It is located in front of the Rainbow Costume shop, in front of the hotel where Dr. Bill investigated the whereabouts of Nick Nightengale, and it is located again in front of a suite and leather shop when Dr. Bill is being followed on foot.Another mailbox grows legs. It disappears completely from the film. It was located just about 30 feet to the right of the Rainbow Costume shop and can be seen right as Dr. Bill pays his cab fare. He backs away from the cab and then you can see it. When Dr. Bill returns his costume the mailbox disappears just as his mask seemed to.Also, in the background the address number sequences on the shops make no sense. One can observe them during as Dr. Bill is followed on foot. The numbers on the buildings on one side of the street progress from 20 to 21 to 22 to 23, etc. Directly on the opposite side of the street the numbers increase from 30 to 31 to 32 to 33,etc. Again this makes no sense. Other mailboxes appear and their proximity to one another are nonsensical. But that is what happens when humans dream.A window air conditioner disappears in moments after characters return to a room. Dr. Bill's office wall is rearranged where diplomas replace paintings that were there earlier. The road to the night club house has changed its journey. The journey exits on an expressway ramp at night and that same exit is bypassed in the day. The daytime approach is from the opposite direction from the evening approach. Many actions take place in mirrors and reflections with backs turned, just as backs can be turned in dreams.Colors play roles that match up with the moods of the scenes. Even some of the rooms change color when characters re-enter with changing moods to match. It even seems that the promotion of the film and all the actors reactions may have been a mask, something they agreed to do for Kubrick so that even his most loyal followers would be convinced that he made a dud out of his last film. He seems to have had the last laugh on an audience that had its eyes wide open to the deceptions but shut closed to what is really just an lucid dream.Kubrick's widow dropped the hint of the film's meaning right before its release and no one was listening. She said the film's main message was fear, deceptions and dreams. She was right.It was the first thought on every adult's mind that this film should not be seen by too young of a viewer. We have a fear of what it might do to such an impressionable mind. We, the audience, were the main characters. The advertisement of the film was a deception to throw us off and played a major masking role and the whole film was a dream.Was this Kubrick's best? I think so.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Kubrick seemed ready to pass the torch to new geniuses.,"Great storytelling. Poor casting judgment. That's how you can resume Kubrick's last masterpiece.Unlike film directors from the school of Lucas, Kubrick treats his audience as intelligent human beings. This is actually a filmmaker who wants you to think when watching his film and not just sit there like an idiot, killing time in a dark room for a couple of hours. He doesn't tell you everything that's going on in the story so you have to figure it out for yourself. Besides, the story is carried from the point of view of one person, and that person has to figure out things just like us.There are some flaws in the movie that stand out too much to be ignored.Especially in the casting. Tom Cruise, a mediocre actor who happens to work with wonderful people, is never believable as his character. Neither's Nicole Kidman by the way. A street hooker that looks like a model from Vogue Magazine disconnects you from a sense of reality, as well as the minorityless New York Streets. Fortunately this movie will survive the test of time and hopefully in the future the presence of Cruise won't be so distracting from the whole thing.The story, which is more teasing than sexual, and basically about a confused guy who ends up crashing into a party he wasn't invited. Some supposedly graphic scenes, that must be in the movie to deliver the story, are ruined with computer imaginery. Yet, none of these are enough reasons to discard this movie. A must see, even when is just short of satisfying.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Grossly underestimated and typically Kubrikian masterpiece,"Just after we watched ""Eyes Wide Shut"" a few years ago, I told my wife that it was very much a ""man's movie"". This is not intended to be a sexist comment, but I believe that in order to appreciate the several typically Kubrikian nuances in the film, one has to watch it through Tom Cruise's eyes and one can only do this effectively if one is a man....like Cruise. With Kubrick, the sum of the parts does not always make an effective whole, but it somehow does so in this film. The direction is very much ""in the face"" as it always is with Kubrick and the various supporting characters - like the shopowner's nubile Lolita-like daughter - somehow convey a hidden message that is for receptive ears only. But to my mind, the best scene in the film is the early morning street sequence after the party where Cruise realises that he is being followed by the bald man. There is a hidden menace in the air that can only be appreciated if you put yourself in Cruise's shoes. For this and several other sequences, this is a very unusual film that needs to be seen and enjoyed in the right mood, preferably on one's own.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Pacing by Merchant & Ivory, Subtlety by Oliver Stone","I really expected that this film's detractors just hadn't ""gotten it"". I figured that I, Kubrick fan that I am, would recognize this film as the masterpiece that it undoubtedly is.Nope.It's a bad film. No two ways about it. It's ham-handed, outdated, ridiculous, absurdly sluggish and the blame for the terrible performances rests squarely on Kubrick's perfectionist shoulders. Kidman was terrific in ""To Die For"" - I'm not a fan of Van Sant, but at least he knows how to work with people. I think Kubrick was too old and out of his element to make this movie. It was a bold step for him, I think, and I give him credit for trying. I'm just disappointed that it failed and wish that ""A.I."" could've been his swan song instead of this.I think this film, edited down to the half-hour of solid material that's actually there, will make a great after-school special in 2030.

Dreamlike! I Am in Love With This Film,"The first thing you must notice is that, in accordance to the title of this review, I LOVE ""Eyes Wide Shut""--not ""like"", not ""appreciate"", but LOVE. As I write this, I am a 17-year-old male who has watched this film four times already, and I shall watch it many times again.""But all the negative comments!"" you say. ""All the people who said this film was Kubrick's worst! That it was unsexy and slow!"" Yes, the sex-to-nudity ratio was very low, and yes, it'll take you over half-an-hour longer to watch the movie than it would to read the novella, but if the physical act of sex and quick pacing were all that mattered in a movie, I wouldn't be here right now.""Eyes Wide Shut"" was severely misrepresented by its hype. It is not an erotic thriller; it is a psychosexual drama/mystery. It is about Dr. Bill Hardford and his wife, Alice, and her confession of sexual longing that sends him on a dreamlike odyssey to discover his own sexual desires and where his wife fits into the equation. It is not romantic. It is a serious drama, easily Stanley Kubrick's most sophisticated work (though ""A Clockwork Orange"" edges over it as my favorite), and not a single word, image, sound, or musical note is wasted. I love every minute of it.To truly enjoy ""Eyes Wide Shut"", you cannot pop it into your DVD player for a passive romp in front of the screen. You must immerse yourself in this film--watch the characters interact with each other and with the scenes around them, let the music and the sound sing their symphonies to your pulsing heart, and, above all, be willing to THINK and HAVE PATIENCE, two things that don't come all that easily to the broad masses.Though Stanley Kubrick is often partial to unknown actors, you will recognize some of the faces, other than Cruise and Kidman. There is Sydney Pollack and Todd Field, but there is also Vinessa Shaw (from ""The Hills Have Eyes""; director Alexandre Aja began working with her because of her role in this movie as the whore Domino), Leelee Sobieski (""Never Been Kissed""), and Alan Cumming (""X-Men"" and ""Spy Kids""), all coming together from movies that range from mediocre to pretty darn good, but they all reach their pinnacle here, in ""Eyes Wide Shut."" Even the small roles--Rade Serbedzija as Milich, Sobieski as his daughter, Marie Richardson as the woman who declares undying love for Bill Harford over her father's deathbed, and Cumming as a hotel desk clerk--are lavished with detail, encapsulated in not only their dialogue but also in their body language and facial expressions.Another thing to notice is this: Stanley Kubrick spent 15 months shooting this film (when most directors could have done it in 3 or 4), and it really shows. Never has a film felt so unrushed, nor so comfortable with what it is. This film breathes as if on the zephyrs of a dream. There is not a moment when the actors look as if they're rushing through their lines or going through the motions; Kubrick not only gives them time to prepare for their roles, but he also gives them screen time to let their actions speak instead of their mouths.""Traumnovelle"", translated as ""Dream Story"", was the basis for this movie; might I add that the movie follows the novel very closely except that it transplants it from 1920s Austria to New York City in the 1990s. And yet it keeps the feel suggested by the original title, for never has a movie been so like a dream! It has both the sweet parts and the nightmarish parts, and then the plain weird parts that make no sense at all. And it is slow--very, very slow and very, very long, like a night in which you cannot get to sleep--but every single time I watch it, I never grow antsy towards the end! ""Amadeus"", ""Fiddler on the Roof"", and ""The Exorcist"" all got me antsy at one point or another, despite the fact that I love all of these movies and have watched them all multiples times. But, with ""Eyes Wide Shut"", I am perfectly content to watch the movie play out in its own sweet time, and cutting this film down to 120 minutes or less (which any other filmmaker would have and could have easily done) would have ruined the dream that this film is. Have I already mentioned that I am a 17-year-old male, by the way, a product of the sound-byte generation?I am gushing into my keyboard, but somehow I feel my words are inadequate. Let me sum up by saying that ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a film you can never hope to see the likes of again--the same can be said for any Kubrick film, especially since he never made the same kind of film twice--and it would be a travesty to miss it simply because you don't have the patience for it. I say GET the patience. Exert a bit of brainpower and try to sink yourself into this film until you're in over your head. It's not something most of us are used to doing with films, but it is entirely worth it.Call me a collegiate who tries to squeeze meaning out of void places. Call me a teen who likes to see his nudity. Call me a person who wants to appear smart by giving this film 10 stars. Call me a Kubrick freak. Slice it any way you like, but I love ""Eyes Wide Shut"", and I think you will, too.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Boring Pointless and Excruciatingly Slow,"I love Kubrick. I like almost all of his films. I hated this. Most of his movies are slow paced. That is fine. They are also interesting, thought provoking, and beautiful as they unfold. This was none of these things. I wanted Nicole Kidman to drop dead. She took so long in getting out her dialogue that I swear you can use audio excerpts in a hypnosis class. I just thought this was painful to watch. There are only two movies on tape that I have come close to or have actually turned off and returned without watching the rest. This came close, but out of respect for all the pleasure Kubrick has given me as a viewer on other films I felt I should at least sit through the whole thing. I wish I hadn't. I wish I never saw this and just always thought of it as that lost Kubrick movie I never saw. Then I wouldn't know it was bad, and I wouldn't now see Kubrick as a lesser director. I have an on going theory that none of the greats can make a good movie in Hollywood anymore. Maybe I have just become jaded and good movies don't seem as good.But this was bad. Completely bad. I liked the music. That is it. Maybe it's because I don't like Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise. They are both too serious for their own good. Or maybe it was all Kubrick. I do know that I have had enough of Kidman Cruise for a long time. Remember Risky Business. Remember Batman Forever. Somewhere along the way these two fooled Hollywood into thinking they could act. Instead of putting them both in a movie how about taking Cruise's smile and plastering it on Kidman's bare butt.You got the best of both of them and you don't have to listen to them talk.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"""They did a bad, bad thing!""","This is one of the worst movies I have ever sat through.  It was definitely the worst Kubrick film.It's hard to imagine a film with this many beautiful women in it (especially Nicole Kidman) as being a waste of time, but it is.  The plot could be accomplished in about 30 minutes if all of the meaningless things had been left out.  You can skip the first half-hour and not be lost at all in the story.  The entire segment with the costume store clerk adds NOTHING to the plot of the movie.  What's more, all of the dialog and action feels like your watching the movie in slow motion.  (Hit your FF button and you'll notice that most characters appear to be moving at normal speed!)  Lead characters do not seem to change at all through out the film.  They react to things in one way, then, when those things change, the characters are still reacting the same way, as if the changes had not occurred.The worst part?  The story is completely anti-climactic!  Do sit waiting the ending that will make all the convoluted items come together because you're not going to get one.The most annoying part for me was this nasty habit that all the characters seemed to have:  One character would say a line, only to have it immediately repeated, as a question, by the other character.  Example: Character one says: ""You can't do that!""  Character two says: ""I can't do that?""  This little bit of abrasion occurs about 1000 times in an already exasperating film.

It Doesn't Disappoint But It Does Frustrate,"Part of the Stanley Kubrick collection of movies (and, indeed, the last in the Kubrick collection) and starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman (when they were themselves a happily married couple), ""Eyes Wide Shut"" doesn't disappoint, but it does frustrate a bit. It's an erotic thriller of sorts, and as such it manages to accomplish most of what you'd expect such a film to do. It IS erotic. It is very much about sex and sexuality and hidden desires and how they affect the relationships we have with those around us. There is a LOT of nudity in this - but somehow, the nudity didn't seem either gratuitous or exploitative. It was natural to this story; indeed, the story wouldn't have worked at all without the nudity. So the nudity involved (which featured a significant amount of Nicole Kidman) doesn't seem intended to titillate (although one can't really complain about a virtual parade of beautiful and often completely naked women) but rather it focuses the story and moves it along. As a thriller, it doesn't really thrill. It's more of a mystery - and it's a pretty good one there as well. There's really no strong sense of where this is going or of what the point of it is, aside from following Dr. Harford (Cruise) on his 24 hours or so of almost (but never quite) debauchery while his wife (Kidman) stays at home sleeping and looking after their daughter. In that sense it does manage to hold your attention very well. You want to know what this is about. What is this seemingly semi-pagan sex club that Harford stumbles upon; who are the people involved in it; are there going to be any repercussions for Harford and his family. In all those ways this is very good and very interesting. But ...As good as it is in almost every way, in the end this movie frustrates because it never really answers anything. The mysteries are all left standing at the end. We never really do find out much about the ""club"" or the people in it, except that they're apparently powerful people who don't want to be known. Harford and his wife seem to put things back together in the end, but we don't really know if there are any lasting repercussions from the adventure of the preceding 24 hours. We don't really know. In the end, that left me feeling a little bit cheated. I wanted to know more about what had happened. I understand that the story had been about the struggles in the relationship of Harford and his wife more than about the ""adventure"" itself, but most of the movie was tied up with the adventure. Something in the end seemed missing from this.It's a good movie. Good story; good directing; good performances. I have no arguments about any of that. In the end, though, it just left me unsatisfied.

Seems like there is an alternative for Viagra,"Meeting the in-laws for the first time can be uncomfortable, especially watching a film that guarantees the awkward fidgeting to kick in. Luckily I wasn't presented with this scenario, so as a future warning it's probably best to stick with The Sound of Music rather than suggest this.Eyes Wide Shut, other than being mentally scaring to the people who ban the word 'Willy' in their home, is a very odd movie indeed. In fact other than bordering the porn genre and making the American Pie films seem worthy of a U rating (even the rubbish new ones), it's hard to know what to make of it.Doctor Bill has everything. Pretty wife, great job, family lifestyle and even looks as handsome as Tom Cruise. Oh err, yes that's right it is Tom Cruise. That is until his wife - Kidman, who quite literally gives plenty of meat to her role, confesses to almost cheating on Bill.Obviously when such a situation occurs it is best to get as laid as possible with anyone with a pulse, rather than talk his issues through with dear wife Alice. Or that's what Bill wants to happen. None of this is particularly odd, only that Bill would rather spend time outdoors in New York City than be with his frequently-undresses-as-soon-as-the-camera-comes-within-a-mile-of-her wife.The mid way point when it takes a Rocky Horror type turn for location and mystery, and where it all gets very peculiar. Still no spoilers from here onwards, so if you want to know what happens this is worth a rent (again reminder, not with the in-laws).It's recommended not to be borrowed from a teenage boy, since if you know of the annoyance of a scene from a DVD being vastly overplayed and becoming blotchy, you will definitely find the first one hour thirty minutes a bumpy ride - and unsurprisingly not for the plot. Ahem.The ending will separate viewers so much into mixed opinions, that doing julienne on an onion would have less division. You'll end up feeling you have either wasted two sexually fuelled hours of your life or that you can't quite understand what to make of it or you'll love it or you'll hate it or you'll spend another two hours afterwards Googleing Nicole Kidman.

"Bill is existing but not living, takes the world for granted.","Unfortunately Kubrick didn't have the chance to finish this film. But if he had I'm sure we would've had a chance to grasp its meaning better. My guess, after having watched the film several times, is that Kubrick would've have wanted us to get the following message: Bill (Cruise) is living in a kind of virtual existence and doesn't appreciate what he has or better said what he has inherited as a member of the western civilization. Alice (Kidman) is portrayed as a victim in her role as a member of the woman gender. This comes clear as the film develops when we see how women are treated all along the film. If they are not nice, faithful and obedient housewives, they are hookers that can be bought and misused more or less like animals or slaves. It is their flesh we are interested in. Almost all of the main scenes in this film focus on these concepts. Bill ignores his wife until she confesses some thoughts and flirtations on other men. He reacts as if some of his possessions were about to be robbed and immediately tries to take revenge by being himself unfaithful to her. Suddenly she is real and exists but instead of giving her love, only tries to cheat on her in a miserable and in the end in a failed manner. Now, this is a very difficult theme for a film at any level and Kubrick as a perfectionist as he was, embarked it in an analytical level going slowly step by step, scene by scene systematically to make us understand the implications of the plot. Unfortunately this gives a rather theatric and passive feeling about the whole thing. It seems we are watching a heavy Ibsen theatric play from the 18th century and not a film that is supposed to be modern. This fact is also reflected on the end that is supposed to be a climax after all these steps. It is not, it is tame and disappointedly anticlimax. It is just showing us the indifference or the difficulty about solving the issues this film is dealing with. If just Kubrick had lived enough time to finish it properly.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A true masterpiece,"The story follows a New York City doctor as he embarks on a night-long journey, after his wife reveals a painful secret to him, during which he infiltrates a massive masked orgy of an unnamed secret society.The last movie of one of the greatest directors to have ever lived, Stanley Kubrick. This movie is a genuine cinematic masterpiece. The movie builds very slowly as Kubrick takes his time with every scene to show us each little detail he had in his mind. This is typical for a Kubrick movie to slowly but surely build suspense and other various feelings he wants to wake in us. But the scenes, however long they are, are stunning and gripping. The cinematography in this movie is one of the best ever in my opinion, the dialogue is, to me, brilliant, slow, but brilliant, the casting, I think, is perfect and the story is mesmerizing.

It doesn't matter if it's Stanley Kubrick's best or worst. It's a movie that makes you think.,"Stanley Kubrick is one of those filmmakers who didn't make a lot of films. Over the course of his forty-year career, he only made thirteen feature films. Very little... However, if we look closely, almost all of them are familiar and immediately entered the pantheon of cinema. They are not perfect films, nor was Kubrick perfect no matter how methodical he was, and there are films of his that are unpalatable (I've already written that in some of them). But each of them, for its reasons, is its own, a very different work. In this film, he makes a case study around desire, sexuality and how we, individually or as a couple, deal with it.The script follows a doctor and his wife. An apparently happy couple who, after a party where they both flirted with other people (without consequences), have a fight where she, perhaps to take away his self-confidence, confesses that she wanted to have another man, some time ago. The revelation leaves the doctor speechless. That night, he doesn't seem to know what he wants: he desires other women, but refuses their advances. But when a pianist friend tells him about a strange party, full of beauties, where he has to play blindfolded, he wants to see it up close. Yes, the party was a gigantic chic orgy, with touches of unholy religious ritual to accentuate the sense of sin and lust. Of course, the unwary guy ends up being discovered and unmasked... and from there, the film becomes denser, with the character increasingly afraid of what might happen to him.The film makes us think a lot about sexuality, monogamy, the importance we give to marital fidelity. I don't know what it was like in 1999, but today it's common to see couples in open relationships, or relatively discreet saunas and swing clubs that throw liberal parties with some regularity. There is still a universe apart - private parties, organized by social networks and for guests only - and it is true that the rich and famous are much more demanding with the reservation of their intimacy, especially when they do naughty things. But what the film proposes to us is, not so much the refusal of monogamy, but that we think about the way we give up all other sexual partners when we really fall in love. The notion of personal sacrifice runs through the entire film (a woman who gives up an erotic fantasy for love, another who proposes to die in order to save an innocent, a man who refuses sex because he is married) and indicates that the best bonds we create in life involve choices and sacrifices in exchange for something greater. In fact, to be happy in a marriage, you need to keep your eyes wide shut to temptations.With a very good and well written story, the film develops the characters very well and allows us to get to know them. For that, the film doesn't mind taking a slower pace that can leave some audiences exasperated. Decisive was the choice of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman for the main roles. At the time, they were Hollywood's pretty couple, and there's no doubt that Kubrick knew how to exploit their enormous personal and intimate chemistry, transporting it to the characters and the film. In fact, this may not be Kubrick's best film (that's relative!) but, for me, it's Cruise's best film so far.Technically, the film has many positives. Kubrick gave an almost maniacal attention to detail and took his time filming. And we can see how each scene was shot in a detailed way, with the camera moving precisely, cuts surgically made, very long and very well edited scenes, taking advantage of the excellent cinematography and sets (where, of course, the mansion of the party stands out). Even more important is the way the director was able to work with the environment and the tension, growing and almost palpable. There is a lot of nudity in this film, including frontal nudity (Kidman herself did scenes where she is practically naked) and some sex scenes that, if not explicit, are very visual. Even so, the film is not, surprisingly, very erotic. I think the director didn't want sex to distract us or cut that tension he was looking for. As for the sound and soundtrack, I think it does its job well, but I didn't find it particularly remarkable.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Unique and Engaging Film,"This is not one of Kubrick's best, in my opinion, but it is very good. An usual look at sexual repression and the world of sexual expression that exists in society and in our selves. This film has two hallmarks of Kubrick's brilliance. The first is the visual imagery, which is stunning throughout. What eerie and unusual images are created in this one. The second is the use of dialogue. Kubrick is very conservative in use of dialogue, but it is all good and meaningful. This one is confusing at points and better when watched again. Cruise is good but Kidman is excellent in this one. If you are a Kubrick fan this is one not to be missed. Also, Netflix is showing the uncensored and uncut version, which is the one to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I tried my hardest during the creepy mask part, but then realized I had to just sit back and watch it, and the general idea of it came to me. At times I thought the movie was just plain weird, but I appreciate it.Wrapping up here, I didn't really like this movie. Hard to understand, and incredible performance from Nicole Kidman. Drags out so long at parts, not a movie for the average film goer, but a more artsy if you will type movie lover. So, I don't really recomend it, but Nicole's performance was a wow one.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Made For A Mature Crowd,"I was 22 when this movie first came out, and I remember thinking it was horribly boring; to the point I wondered why it ever got made. The 'T & A' didn't even save it - in a time where Hollywood movies were really the only place to go for such.Decades later I watched it as a middle aged man, and it's quite enjoyable.The most ironic part, is the 'T & A' was all the buzz upon its release, and at no stage in my life did it ever factor in, when it came to my verdict of this film.The 'human behavioral study' at work is the pillar of this film; with every character introduced. And the 'Illuminati hints' give all the plebs who watch a feeling like they've been included in something they weren't supposed to be.If you've 'grown up' - you'll enjoy this.If you're not quite sure if you've 'grown up', you're not ready.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The dark night...,"Talk about your long dark night of the soul. This is a deliberately unsettling exploration of jealousy, sexual curiosity and deviance masked under a morality tale against adultery and drug-taking...I think.Kubrick's very adult film takes us into the world of successful New York doctor Tom Cruise (""Dr Bill Harford"") and Nicole Kidman and from the simple opening of them leaving their infant child in the charge of their baby-sitter to attend a glitzy Christmas party hosted by the mega-rich Sydney Pollack, sees them subject to sexual temptation with third parties (two for one in Cruise's case) from which they just about extricate themselves. However, post-party and back in their own bed, we see them smoking a joint and gradually fashion an argument, culminating in Kidman's shocking admission to her husband about a sexual fantasy she had over a soldier some time before, even when in her husband's company. One surprise call for Cruise to attend the death of his old mentor gives him the opportunity to explore his darker side and attempt to expiate the vision of Kidman and her fantasy love which fuels his actions.I can't claim to understand the many facets of this strong film but was certainly held from one discomfiting scene to the next. First Cruise is almost seduced by the grieving daughter of the dead man whom he's attending, then he similarly pulls back from a liaison with a kindly (as it turns out very kindly) prostitute, thanks to a timely phone call from his wife, before finally his curiosity and motivations get the better of him and he gate-crashes a sinister masqued orgy where apparently anything goes but in truth all is carefully orchestrated, monitored and controlled. On the way though, he witnesses a troubling situation at the fancy-dress shop whose owner he gets up after hours to furnish him with the required disguise for the ball, with the owner's obviously barely pubescent daughter caught almost in-flagrante with what appears to be a father and son Oriental pair.The centrepiece of the film and the one that perhaps demonstrates Kubrick's powers most is the orgy scene. A deliberately constructed long slow tease of a scene with the viewer made to follow Cruise's subjective voyeuristic gaze as he wanders through the plush, massive rooms of the secret mansion, witnessing sexual acts performed in dumb show for the specially invited guests to a backdrop of a gloomy but haunting piano refrain. Thus we the viewer feel the danger of the faceless Mr Big who catches Cruise out in his deception and who to protect the anonymity and exclusivity of his ""parties"" intimates that he will extract the highest price to deter interlopers in the future.I found myself carried along uneasily on Cruise's coat-tails and of course we are made to examine our own morality and sexual mores. Even as it seems Cruise may have just about learned his lesson, that shocking last word on camera of Kidman's perhaps gives the lie to that. Of course it could all have been a drug-fuelled dream/nightmare of Cruise's, which would help explain the enigmatic title of the movie...Both leads are very good in what must have been difficult parts to play, especially as they were of course married at the time. The support players were all as significant but unobtrusive as they needed to be. However it's in the orchestration of the set, actors, lighting, camera movement and music that one sees a great director at work. I doubt I could have been persuaded to subject matter like this without knowing that the likes of Kubrick was behind the camera.As it happened, it turned out to be his last movie and what a demanding, challenging, even risky one it turned out to be. While I couldn't argue it as the best movie in his oeuvre, it is obviously the work of a major talent and testimony that he maintained his considerable powers to the end.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An immersive sexual odyssey,"Stanley Kubrick will forever remain a master. So much of his work is respected and The Shining is my favourite horror film of all time. Whilst I didn't love Eyes Wide Shut to that extent, it was still a phenomenal experience.Eyes Wide Shut follows Bill Harford, a New York doctor who embarks on a sexual odyssey during one night when his wife reveals an unpleasant secret to him.Eyes Wide Shut is Kubrick's final film and one I've been hearing about for a long time. The reveption is very split with some hailing it as a masterpiece whilst others think it's terrible. By the end of it, I honestly didn't know what to think of it. It's quite a challenging film and I've been thinking about it ever since. The film is very long and has a slow pace but it's very atmospheric at the same time. There were some parts where the film dragged due to the slow pacing but it also helped me get immersed into the world of the film. The use of colours and the way Kubrick presented the night life transcended me into this dream-like and lust filled world. I also cannot forget how amazing the score was. It brought a creepy and strange feeling to the film that matched perfectly to the bizarre nature of some scenes. The performances were stellar. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman did an excellent job playing a couple that are struggling with all these sexual feelings and the supporting cast also do a fine job.Eyes Wide Shut is a very strange film. There is so much mystery and ambiguity in it that I haven't been able to take my mind off it. It's a film that deals with themes like jealously, sex, infidelity and so much more but I feel I haven't even scratched the surface of the film's deeper meanings. It's sad how this ended up being Kubrick's final film but it's undeniable how talented of a filmmaker and storyteller he is. I'm definitely gonna watch this film a couple more times and I hope people give it a try because it is a fascinating experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Stanley Kubrick's final film,This is a compelling movie that has a bit of suspense and sexual aspects to it. Like some Stanley Kubrick's other films this is one of those movies that is kinda uncomfortable to watch. The portrayal of sexual thoughts between William Harford(Tom Cruise) and his wife Alice(Nicole Kidman) is interesting. This is a very provocative film that has to do with psychotic and sexual thoughts and behaviors. It isn't one of Kubrick's best work though but still a engaging movie from beginning to end although it can be messed up sometimes. Actually a lot of times. Although it lacks the impact in most Kubrick's films his pacing and way of revealing certain elements as the movie progresses is well crafted. And also knows how much to show and how much to leave in the audiences imagination.6.9/10,6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Remove The Blindfold,"This is the sort of film that only Kubrick could make...no one else stretches our tolerance for languorous self-indulgence in quite the same way. Especially with the liberal use of female nudity...common in European film, but subject to all manner of puritanical finger-wagging in the US. Kudos to Cruise for publicly sticking up for the artist's finished result. The only compromise was a digitally added cloaked figure in front of an act of copulation.As with the master's prior great works, what matters is not so much the plot or content but the -way- in which he conceives things purely for film. The hallmarks of this are the rearwards camera view that lead the actors through space, the dreamy long takes and reverse-angle cuts with generous lead time between bits of dialogue.With this film we get the tantalizing promise of a narrative game - is this a dream? Whose dream is it, actually? Or overlapping dreams with no 'real world' to bring us back to? Note the use of one redhead (Kidman) to drive us into one dream state, and the opposing talisman (Davis, also a redhead) to drive us out again. Intermittent affairs with the blondes only lead to dead-ends.But I think Kubrick wasn't sure of where to leave us, so he uses his customary insouciant ending.

A lost gem,"This was my first Kubrick film and I am very impressed by this film, it gives me a sense of humanity that is not seen often in films. I enjoy it.Slow burn, classy New York aesthetic, conversations between characters feel authentic, characters well rounded, actions and motives feel authentic, nothing is spoonfed to you, the pacing is slow but it allows you to take in the atmosphere of the scenes, movie takes time to fully develop characters, shots are beautiful, some may see the events of this film as aimless, that it's pointless and nothing truly happens but for me that's what drew me in, this is real life, also Tom Cruise is a great actor.The only thing I did not like was the ending and second half of the film, there was this soundtrack that got overplayed, the actions that take place feel extra pointless, I thought that the film was setting itself up for a tragic or open ended ending but instead it just ended with confusion. I will admit that it felt ominous but still just didn't make sense to me.Great film, do watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One final comment ...,"One thing I forgot to add in my earlier post is a response to the many reviewers who advise four or five viewings to understand what Kubrick is trying to say.  This is an incredibly arrogant comment and shouldn't go unchallenged.First, as an avid movie-goer, I well understand that repeated viewings of a film will sometimes give different perspectives and meanings.  Cool Hand Luke is one such film, Edward Scissorhands another, On the Waterfront, Being There, and many, many others.  However, if a director makes his film SO obtuse that it takes more than two viewings to understand it (really, more than one), then the film fails.  The point of art is to communicate, not to needlessly play mind games.Second, I *did* get the message that Kubrick intended on sending, and I still feel the movie was pointless and boring.  That's due to some very lackluster directing and below-par acting, especially by Nicole Kidman. Having interminable long shots of empty rooms and hallways may be a hallmark of Kubrick's (I'd disagree with that), but if so, it doesn't work.  It drags the pace of the film down to a crawl.  So does Kubrick's idea of delivering 'important' dialogue: stretching the words out needlessly in a monotone. Small wonder this film came in at 2:45.  Watch The Green Mile, another multi-layered movie, and see how fast the three-hour runtime passes.I understand that some reviewers have an emotional attachment to Kubrick, and I also really enjoyed other of his works.  Take another viewing of Dr. Strangelove and A Clockwork Orange.  Sure, you can get different subtleties and symbolisms on multiple viewings, but the main themes are communicated clearly  on the first viewing.  Both movies also were well-paced, included excellent acting, and had much more interesting (and real) conflicts, taking real chances with the material, not the half-baked and phony issues which form the crux of this movie.  In this case, sadly, the Emperor has no clothes.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This movie blows.  It's bad beyond compare.,"I saw this movie in a popular Los Angeles cinema on its opening day.  I've never heard more yawning, himming and hawning, and shifting in theater seats like I heard during this movie.  And there's good reason:  this movie was bad.If you liked this movie, then you are just one of those bandwagon fans who doesn't have a mind of his own.  You probably liked Malick's joke-of-a-war-movie ""The Thin Red Line.""  Remember how everybody pulled the ol' ""emperor's new clothes"" bit with that guy?  Hollywood was afraid to say that this was one of the worst war movies ever made because they put so much money into his work.  And this is exactly the same response to Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut.  This by far was one of the most boring films I've ever seen in my life of going to the cinema.  I feel embarrassed for anybody who says it was good.  I challenge those people to sit through it again. I'd rather go to the dentist.  And how bad was that score?  That horrific pounding of the single note from a piano was such a bad joke to anybody who knows how to score films.  Movie goers were laughing every time that single note pounded into our brains.  It failed in building suspense, and in fact, pulled me out of the scene all together.  And how laughable was that orgy scene?  Half the theater was laughing during that scene too.  And gee, we suffered so much because we couldn't actually see the actors simulating sex up close and personal.  As if that would've saved this bad movie.The only positive I can offer is that Tom and Nicole did a fantastic job with such bad material, and dare I say, such bad direction.  That's right, Stanley blew it with his direction.  And let's be honest, any guy who does 70 takes per setup per scene isn't a genius.  He's obsessive compulsive and sadly over-rated in his ability to work with actors.  Again, it's like Terrance Malick.  If you shoot 1.2 million feet of film in your movie, you're bound to come up with enough good shots to make yourself look good despite all your shortcomings.I cannot recommend this bad bad movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Kubrick's legend,"Well, this is it. After two months I've seen every Kubrick film in order, from Fear and Desire to Eyes Wide Shut. And while I was a bit nervous about how then- 70 year old Kubrick would handle the topic of sex with Hollywood stars after a decade off from directing, I have to applaud this absolutely wonderful surprise of film, horribly underrated on this site, the IMDb.Eyes Wide Shut channels much of Kubrick's previous work, such as A Clockwork Orange and 2001 while crafting its own unique identity. If you've ever wondered how directors from previous eras would fair in this generation, look no further: this film shows evolution. It's impossible to believe that this was made by the same man who made The Killing. But don't believe that this film is great because of its director or his past work: the score reflects my opinion of the film on its own.Summarizing Eyes Wide Shut is difficult: the plot consists of a couple fighting and he walks into a series of events causing an awakening. Is it romantic? Nope. Thriller, or a mystery? Yep, and a bit scary in places too. But for the the entire 2.5+ hour runtime its engaging, and constantly interesting. You'll wonder what happens next and how it all plays out, and there's a sense of wonder throughout: movie magic.I wonder if Kubrick knew this was going to be his last film, because he references so much of his previous work, something I haven't noticed him to do much. Notably from Clockwork and Lolita is the content. From 2001 there is a sense of realization. Such as learning about the moment we evolved into what we are today, Eyes Wide Shut ironically opens our eyes to aspects of life we tend to pass over. A revolution.And from Barry Lyndon and Full Metal Jacket, Eyes Wide Shut draws beauty. This film is beautiful to see, with extravagant upper class parties and a living city. I was shocked to learn this was all filmed in England.From this film I appreciate Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman more as actors. Working with Kubrick was never easy, especially on this film's long shoot. Both leads perform excellently, and are perfect for the characters. They were up to the challenges and demands of the film, and the offscreen parallels don't hurt either.I can't believe this is a 7.2. Maybe it's the hype, or maybe some just didn't like the length. But everything serves its purpose in Eyes Wide Shut, like the greatest films. Eyes Wide Shut is an excellent film, a great swan song from the greatest director of all time who left my eyes wide open. 8.7/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Missing the point,"This film is not only about sex, nudity and fornication. My wife, who completely missed the point was amazed that 'Nicole allowed herself to be in this lewd film'. Of course there is a LOT of nudity, but what struck me was what Kubrick was telling us about where power resides in society.Cruise is an affluent, well connected Doctor with a beautiful wife who slowly becomes aware of an unseen, powerful inner sanctum who literally get away with murder. They can make people disappear. They can threaten anyone who exposes them. They can even threaten Cruise himself!I thought his portrayal was brilliant, you could see the good Doctor's mind working as, piece by piece, he realizes how hopeless his position would be were he to air his suspicions to Police.Kubrick is telling us something far more profound than the incredible debauchery of a wealthy class of New York citizens. He also knew it would be lost on most viewers of this excellent film.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Review - Eyes Wide Shut,"Kubrick never lost his talent for directing, but he certainly missed the key that alimented is precedent daring and ambiguous stories. In a certain way, this film surfed on the cult status of 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Shining, and A Clock Work Orange.This film is faithful to Kubrick's previous ones in terms of color palette, it is always enjoyable to see how many different emotions he can transpose to screen with red. However, all those gimmicks in the production design are for fans of Kubrick clues to the resolution of the story.The so call ""odyssey"" of Bill felt long and extremely redundant in ideas exactly like the predictable and cheesy dialogue.But really, Eyes Wide Shut is too explanatory. If you pay a little attention you can easily notice that Kubrick is giving away every bit of substances, and you realize that after all, it is just bones wrapped in aesthetic eroticism.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Truth about (most) people,"This is such a terrifyingly great depiction of the elite. What makes it so great, is that we never know what truly goes on behind the curtain. We only get a glimpse of the strange rituals they participate in. The same as the character we follow, Bill Harford. We observe It, but we never learn what these rituals mean, our what will happen next. Imagination is way more terrifying than showing.It's arguably one of the best character studies in history. I'm talking about Bill Harford. We see how he falls into the harsh reality of life. We see him being jealous, insecure, and sometimes insincere. The whole movie is him realising how dirty this world is. Everybody is lying, doing everything to make money, and being dishonest. He simply realises how fake everything is, including his ""perfect"" family, and finally, with his wife, he tries to fix his problems, at least in his own family with honesty.But that's the harsh reality of life, he likely won't be able to change it entirely. We are beings, that tend to do most things just for our own sake. When I look back from this film to Kubrick's A Space Odyssey, especially at the opening scene, I sense a pattern within those films. The Dawn of Men sequence which shows the evolutionary process of us could've been also shown before this film starts, and it still would've had meaning. The same goes for A Clockwork Orange. Kubrick's films are all very different when you look at them first, but they are all practically on the same boat. They are psychological character studies. And Bill Harford, for me turns out to be his best, because he is, what most men in society are.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pretty Good Movie,"Rating: 7.7
Overall, an interesting watch as the audience gets to see Kubrick give off his sendoff (with many elements that are synonymous to his style) in a story that captivating for the most part, but does not deliver to the level he is known for with not so great writing and final act that really falls apart towards the end.Good Direction (It was definitely Kubrick in style but the direction of people other than the leads (and even the leads) was a bit underwhelming at times), Decent Acting (Good from Tom Cruise (Plays a very Tom Cruise character throughout the movie but does shine in different parts), Decent from Nicole Kidman (A very hit or miss performance from her as there are some moments where she is really good and some moments where she gives questionable deliveries), Pretty Bad to Decent from the rest of the cast), Good to Very Good Story (The story and story-telling of the first two acts is very captivating and very interesting but the final act really falls apart in terms of a climax (which really comes in the middle but there is a definite climax in the end) and resolution), Decent Screenplay (The foreshadowing and symbolism of the movie is very good and pretty standard to Kubrick's style, but the dialogue is really simplistic and pretty bad at times), Very Good Score/Soundtrack (Really did a good job in helping music paint the scenes/mood of the movie and the record-player stopping the music was a nice touch), Very Good Cinematography (Extremely Kubrick with cinematography (long panning to show rooms and sharp shot reverse shots) but needs to be as it helps paint the scenes (especially in the party)), Good to Very Good Sound (as seen with the record player note), Good Editing (Very Kubrick in style with its fades), Very Good Costumes (Helps with giving the lavish, mysterious feels of the party), Plot Structure was in thirds with the first two acts being good in exposition and rising action but the last act really is not structured well as it is a bit rushed and does not come to any resolution in the end, Pacing was more on the slower side (typical of Kubrick) with 20 minutes that could have either have been put into the end or just removed to make it a tighter runtime, Build to climax was pretty anticlimactic with the real climax happening in the middle of the movie; climax was very bland and boring as the real climax being in the middle (kinda blew because it was neither closed up or left open to interpretation. It was this weird middle ground and the actual ending was pretty anticlimactic), Tone was very kubrick in style but had some shades of mystery that kept the viewers interested, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman might not have been the best cast for this movie as even though they are married they do not really show that much chemistry.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Lesser Kubrick,"Not much happens in Eyes Wide Shut, yet somehow the movie kept my attention. It's weirdly interesting, but not necessarily good. Because of that, it seems much shorter than its almost three-hour length.While Nicole Kidman got better reviews than husband Tom Cruise, they really gave basically the same performance, which is mainly comprised of talking really slowly. I give no credit or blame to either of them for that, since it's clearly what Kubrick wanted.But that's Kubrick for you. He knew what he wanted, he got what he wanted, and then the audience liked it or didn't. He was an uncompromising visionary, and while I would have liked his final movie to be something I actually enjoyed, I do admire his lack of compromise.Still, for me the most entertaining moment of the movie was when Cruise groped Kidman and my girlfriend whispered (""probably the first time that's ever happened."")",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Kubrick's Second best after 2001,"I think the critics, even the ones who like this film, are missing the point. When 2001 came out, most every critic panned it completely. Pauline Kael, the uber-critic, called it dull and unimaginative. At that time, I can understand her view. Kubrick's famous films that far were The Killing, Paths of Glory, Spartacus, Lolita (the only one on this list I haven't seen), and Dr. Strangelove. All of these are wonderful films, Dr. Strangelove usually being considered his second masterpiece after 2001, but they lack the style of all the later Kubrick films. 2001 may be somewhat tedious to the average person once in a while, and it's almost uninterpretable, but it leaves posibly the strongest after-thoughts of any film. Kubrick's target was our love for narrative, but our unconscious minds. The pleasure of watching 2001 and Kubrick's other later films resides deep inside. It is too bad critics only have a few days to write their reviews. But by this time, they should have seen enough of Kubrick's films to realize this. The Shining, A Clockwork Orange, and Full Metal jacket all aged beautifully in my perception, and they all get better with each subsequent viewing. No other director who ever lived can do this.Only 2001 effects the unconscious mind more than Eyes Wide Shut. It is truly his second best film. It's images wander in my mind two days afterward as if I saw it an hour ago. I lay in bed the whole first night thinking about it, not sleeping for ten minutes. I didn't need to go to sleep to dream that night. The film seemed as if I dreamed it. The grainy film really added to that effect. And the color scheme. God, Kubrick was a genius to set this film at Christmastime. There are several gorgeous shots of Christmas lights. And a neon rainbow that especially lingers in my mind. And the religious orgy scene, which will undoubtedly become the most famous scene in the film, has colors that just made me weep with their heavenly beauty. Oh, and those purple sheets at the very end of the film. Critics complained about a speech near the end that undermined and ruined a nice murder mystery thread of the narrative (see especially Roger Ebert's review; though I love him, I think he's dead wrong this time). I think it would have been below Kubrick to end the film with a mysterious twist. Any director can give us a narrative trick at the end to put a goofy smile on our face. The idiotic ending of The Usual Suspects comes to the head of my mind. It's usually misinterpreted as genius because people don't realize that the sum of the parts ought to naturally be greater than one clever scene. If you want to see real genius, see Eyes Wide Shut, the second best film that Kubrick made, the second best film of the nineteen-nineties, and one of the best films ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not so nice,"Movie obviously completely focused on sex that dominates throughout the film but it's not much more than this because otherwise it's just a little bit of entertainment. To be honest, the atmosphere that pervades the whole film is very beautiful and full of anxiety and helps the viewer to remain glued to the film without ever getting bored but in my opinion there is something wrong because the film is slightly repetitive at times and in the whole part after, let's say the central part is too unreal for a film like this which also has the defect of wanting to pivot only on the part of the ''silk'' because for all the rest it is a tiny bit empty.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Boring and stupid,"I decided to watch this on NetFlix because it starred 2 popular and talented actors, but I must say I could not WAIT until the movie ended. It was so stupid I can't believe I wasted my electricity bill on it and the time sitting on my as* for it. There was no point to some of the scenes and they just jumped right into them instead of gradually and smoothly going into it. There are a lot of parts where the actor is just giving a long speech and that is the main part of the scene. I saw this in the beginning with Nicole Kidman, she was just talking and it was bad acting. There are other movies that are MUCH MORE interesting and realistic about the temptations/fantasy of cheating. STUPID MOVIE >:/",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Kubrick's Last Haunting Masterpiece,"This was Stanley Kubrick's last film, completed shortly before his death and twelve years after its predecessor, ""Full Metal Jacket"". Kubrick was capable of producing brilliantly original films quite different to anything else, such as ""A Clockwork Orange"", and ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is another example of this ability. It can be seen as an erotic film, but that does not mean that it is pornographic or titillating. Rather, it is erotic in the sense that it deals with issues relating to physical love and sexuality, but it deals with them in an intelligent, sober manner.The mood of eroticism is set from the start. Bill Harford, a New York doctor , and his wife Alice have been invited to a Christmas party given by Victor Ziegler, one of his patients. At the party Harford is called to treat a naked young woman who is suffering from a drugs overdose. (It turns out that she is a prostitute). Both Harford and Alice flirt with others, he with two young models, she with a smooth but lecherous older man. Returning home, they get involved in a discussion about sexual attraction and jealousy, which leads Alice to confess that she once came close to being unfaithful.On the surface, Harford is a man who seems to have everything going for him- affluence, a successful practice which includes many wealthy and influential patients, of whom Ziegler is one, a luxurious apartment, marriage to an attractive wife and a young daughter. Like many films, however, this one is concerned to explore the hidden depths of character that can lie below a surface appearance of normality. Harford is called away from his discussions with Alice by a telephone call to attend a patient, and is plunged into a series of increasingly bizarre sexual encounters. The daughter of a dead patient attempts to seduce him, there is a meeting with another prostitute, he encounters an eccentric Eastern European costume-hire shop owner with a nymphomaniac daughter. The strangest of Harford's adventures comes after he meets Nick Nightingale, an old friend from medical college, in a bar. Nick is now working as a musician, and tells Harford of a mansion near the city where the rich and powerful meet to take part in sexual orgies, something Nick knows about because he is among those employed to provide musical entertainment at these gatherings. He tells Harford that one is due to take place that night and gives him the information he will need, including the password, to gatecrash the event.This is a multi-layered film that defies any simple interpretation. Harford's adventures can be interpreted either as reality, or as a sexual fantasy, or as a dream. The lack of any definite answer to this question is, however, a strength rather than a weakness. There is certainly something dreamlike about the film, especially the part dealing with his night-time odyssey through the city. (Most of the film, in fact, takes place either at night or in darkened rooms; only a few scenes take place in daylight). The orgy itself- the key scene in the film- is dealt with in a particularly surreal, hallucinatory style. It takes place in an opulent but chilly stately home, and takes the form of a strange, quasi-religious ritual performed by masked participants to the accompaniment of weird music. The women are all naked except for their masks, the men dressed in long hooded gowns similar to the robes worn by monks.On one level the film is about contemporary neuroses, both sexual and otherwise. Some of Harford's encounters can be seen as symbolic of fears about sexually transmitted disease (the prostitute he meets turns out to be HIV-positive) or sexual orientation (he is twice mistaken for a homosexual, once by a gang of hooligans and once by a gay hotel receptionist who tries to chat him up). The strange orgy, organised by a secretive group of men drawn from America's powerful and wealthy classes, may reflect conspiracy theories about domination by elite secret societies who ruthlessly exclude the public from their deliberations. Harford's attempt to gatecrash ends in failure when he is both literally and metaphorically unmasked as an impostor. On the other hand, this scene may have symbolic overtones about anonymous, impersonal sex or Freudian ones about fear of castration or impotence; Harford never takes part in any sexual activity, but remains a voyeur.Despite its dark overtones and disturbing symbolism, the film actually has an optimistic conclusion. Without wanting to give too much away, I can say that Harford makes some startling discoveries about both a friend and his wife, but these lead to a reconciliation between himself and Alice and a strengthening of their marriage. The action takes place just before Christmas, and brightly lit Christmas trees are a recurrent image, appearing in a number of scenes. These can be interpreted either as specifically Christian images or as more generalised symbols of hope and goodwill.I was never really convinced by Nicole Kidman, whose Alice too often seemed an odd mixture of childishness and sexual forthrightness. Tom Cruise, however, was very good in the main role of Harford. At times (as in ""The Last Samurai"") he can be guilty of overacting, but there was no trace of that here; his performance remained calm, controlled and deliberate, despite the bizarre experiences his character was going through. That Harford seemed emotionally in control throughout perhaps strengthens the idea that his adventures are to be interpreted as a dream or fantasy (as perhaps does the title).The music for the film is particularly memorable; not just that during the orgy scene, but also the recurrent simple piano motif and that Shostakovich waltz which is in itself capable of summoning up an atmosphere of elegant decadence. Kubrick's last film is also his last masterpiece, a strange, haunting fantasy and a work to stand alongside earlier masterpieces such as ""Paths of Glory"", ""Spartacus"", ""Dr Strangelove"" and ""A Clockwork Orange"". 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Open your eyes to this masterpiece!,"The last film directed by Stanley Kubrick, EYES WIDE SHUT, is a masterpiece, or by other words, a magnificent way for a director to finish is career. This film is too straight to follow, but at the same time very complex, because it's a deep reflection about a couple's relationship and intimacy. It's about love, jealous, matrimony, loyalty, and adventures outside matrimony, whether ""they are real or in dreams""The viewer watches the plot through Dr. William Harford's mind (played by Tom Cruise) and we feel his fears, his tension, his insurance about his matrimony and the loyalty of his wife. We can feel the tension growing and how lost he is! His wife, Alice (Nicole Kidman), is also lost and confused, but she's controlling the game, to the point of testing him, telling him an affair she once had with a sailor man But did it really happen, or is she just telling her sexual fantasy to instigate him, to make him jealous? I think the end answers that!Aside from their relationship, this movie is also great for many other reasons! It's mysterious, suspenseful, odd and mystical! The scene where occurs that weird and mysterious party is amazing, because it creates a magnificent ambiance of seduction and mystery, but also obscurity and weirdness. No one knows who is who, behind those creepy and sinister masks, what increases the mystery. The ceremony scene is simply astonishing. Together, the music, the voices, the masks, the women, and the ritual it self create this bizarre and mystical ambiance, that is so seductive at the same time. It's one of my favourite's scenes ever I must say! From all types of cinema, from all movies I ever saw!The acting is great, especially by Tom Cruise, which does one of the best roles of his long and succeeded career. His character is quite lost, scared and confused and he plays it very well. Nicole Kidman also does a good job, playing his tempting wife.The soundtrack is amazing! I know it's not an original OST, since it's a very well known classical piece, but it's just brilliant, providing suspense and tension to the film.This movie is a masterpiece, and it resumes it all!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The proof of that is that the highest votes on IMDb for this film has been given to males under 18 and the lowest by females in general, most noticeably over 45. I must say, though - Eyes Wide Shut has very little to do with sex and very much to do with relationships. Of course sex has a lot to do with it, especially if viewed from a Freudian perspective, but the film's main focus is on the nature and limits of relationships. What is cheating? Is thinking about other people cheating? Where lies the limit between thinking and doing? Does Dr. Bill cheat on Alice anymore than she does on him? What is acceptable in terms of sexual fantasy? To what extent our sexual frustrations, aspirations and ethics is dependent primarily on preconceived social values? Eyes Wide Shut raises all these important questions and there resides its greatness.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Old Fashioned and Dated,In 2020 this movie feels really old-from a different time when the reality that the global billionaire class was basically a group of strip mining predators was still a secret to the majority of the population.

Kubrick's last movie.... Pure art,Stanley Kubrick. The god of film-making. His movies is not equivalent to anything else. True art. This movie is a masterpiece. A dream you never want to end. Kubrick really know how to mesmerize us with his unforgettable use of camera and music. He puts the viewer in a state of trance and you don't even know if the things that Bill Harford (tom cruise) experience is a dream or something unexplainable. And that defines Eyes Wide Shut very well. A nonverbal experience. A message from Kubrick which is not even supposed to be explained in words.It took Kubrick 13 years to deliver Eyes Wide Shut after the release of Full Metal Jacket. In this 13 years Kubrick where very depressed sometimes and he felt like he had a big pressure to perform in his next movie. it had to be a special movie. Not just an average movie.And then finally when the work with Eyes Wide Shut where finished he died a week later...And the results: A movie like nothing else & for me the best movie ever made along with 2001: A Space Odyssey10/10 thank you Kubrick,10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Perfect Conclusion to the Trilogy of Great Journeys:,"I believe that Kubrick's swansong is a great masterpiece, it is one of my favorite films and has been since I saw it first time. I felt under the film's spell from the very beginning: the camera was so much in love with Kidman's gorgeous figure, her golden hair; the music by Shostakovich - so European even though the film takes place in NYC. The film was so clever and so mesmerizing. The more I watched the more I realized that there was something vaguely familiar and strangely comical in the film. I kept thinking and it occurred to me that Kubrick paid homage and parodied Joyce's ""Ulysses"" in the same way Joyce himself treated Homer's celebrated poem. For me, there are so many similarities between ""Bloomsday"" and ""Billnight"", between both men's journeys and adventures on the streets of Dublin and NYC that I am curious if anyone else noticed that. There are visits to the Kingdom of Dead, sirens, Cyclops, the sorceress that turns men in pigs (the figure of speech that is :)). Both Bloom and Bill try to run from but can't forget and eventually come back to the only woman they are attracted to for eternity - Penelope - Molly Bloom- Alice Harford. Both deeply suffer from her infidelity (Bloom from the real one and Bill from imaginative but it hurts the same). Both are very insecure men who doubt their own masculinity and try to prove to them that they are the real men but they can't. Both are married to the strong women who would give them hope in the end - both ""Ulysses"" and ""EWS"" ends on the affirmative note. The last word in ""Ulysses"" ""Yes"" belongs to Molly just before she fell asleep and the last lines in EWS are:""Alice Harford: I do love you and you know there is something very important we need to do as soon as possible. Dr. Bill Harford: What's that? Alice Harford: F_uck.""If that's not the happiest and most satisfying ending for a movie ever then I don't know which one is. For the great ending I can forgive a movie many sins. But tell you the truth, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is perfect, it has nothing to apologize for. It is the movie that would be admired many years from now. Perfect conclusion to the trilogy of great journeys of a man for search of himself - ""Odyssey"", ""Ulysses"", and ""Eyes Wide Shut"".",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The lighting was very good as well, I especially like the ""christmas tree in each house"" shot. This was pure cinema but if this film was done by any other director it would be called art house. I found with all of Kubrick's film is the lack of pace and action but what was said was interesting and maybe true. I felt there was a lack of characters but the actors there gave great performances, Cruise, Kidman etc. but I especially like the suit-hire man and the piano player.

Beyond perfection: Sculpting in light,"Kubrick experimented with styles and changes in styles in the narrative. Here he changes the standpoint in the narrative from a movie about relationships to a thriller and then changes once again to more philosophical issues. Inside these major styles there are smaller changes in storytelling, introducing sub-layers in the story. Furthermore, the movie repeatedly questions its own existence and portrayal of events.Camera-work is once again amazing. Every shot is perfect, it feels like sculpting in light. A wide variety of lenses and color scheme's is used. Take for example the wonderful scene in the pool room that is pivotal in the movie and took so much time. (Note also the congruity in that scene between the change in the actor's positions and the change in the story). Colors are also used to code the whole movie (with a crazy amount of detail: even the fence is blue).After these aspects, there's the story. Eyes Wide Shut explores the other side of a faithful life: Bill Harford enters an unfamiliar world where he doesn't know the rules. But there's also commentary about these worlds: the masks, the shabby apartment, the daughter prostitute. The character of Alice(!) suggesting the mystery.Kubrick thought of this movie as his best ever. It is. It is probably the best movie ever made. In a few years time it will (as usual with him) be heralded as a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
disjointed and endless,"I was, like most people, anticipating seeing ""Eyes Wide Shut.""  I think both Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise are good actors and thought the plot sounded interesting.  And it was... for a while.  The beginning of the movie was great.  The party where Nicole gets tipsy and then the scene in their bedroom where they're talking about jealousy.  Then they lost me and most of the people who were in the theater with me.  Parts of the rest of the movie were interesting.  Cruise's scene with Vinessa Shaw and the storyline with the father pimping his daughter were fine.  But other parts of the movie were just odd.  Cruise buying a costume to go to a party, the party itself which had naked women in a circle while some strange man banged a stick on the ground just baffled me.  It added nothing to the movie.  The movie was disjointed and just when you hoped it would end, it kept going.  What could have been a thought-provoking movie about jealousy left me thinking why two good actors would do this movie and why I spent ten dollars and almost three hours of my own time watching it.  I really wanted to enjoy this movie.  I went to the theater with high expectations.  Maybe they were too high. Maybe I just didn't get it.

An underrated masterpiece,"There is so much going on in this movie its not even funny, I know Im going to need to rewatch this a few more times to pick up on this I missed during my first ever watch earlier today. It may start off as slow in the first twenty to thirty minutes but the story immediately kicks into high gear soon afterwards leaving you hooked in and will never let you go, not even after it's end creditsThere's definitely a lot of sexualized themes going on involving adulatory with Nicole Kidman's character fantasizing about cheating on her husband that being Tom Cruise's character with other men, cuckholding and some levels of Pedophilia especially in one scene where a costume store's owner literally pimps his under age daughter out to prominent men in society for I can only guess special favorsIm getting the whole devil tempting you with sin vibes going on in this movie, the devil being the one in the red cape and masked of that secretive societal group of masked elites engaging in all sorts of debauchery just as Hollywood and the real elites themselves probably do. This group and this party with the masks is reflection of the rothschild family and their bizarre parties with strange masks you can look for yourself online. It's all about lust and doing other awful things you can get away with, while getting away with them and disposing of those who dare to try and expose themNo doubt at least to me Stanley Kubrick is trying to expose these elites and illuminati group or trying to shed light and raise awareness in a time where there was so much secrecy of the evil deeds that went on in Hollywood or as the recent Epstein scandal with sexual trafficking. Could totally be wrong but with this group in particular I dont think so, there was special attention and the effect they have on society as whole suggests that Kubrick was trying to bring them into the light with this filmTom Cruise in my opinion personally carries the film from start to finish with his character ' Bill', as although he is married to Alice who is Nicole Kidman's character, Bill goes through a psychological journey through a span of two nights throughout the film to discover who he really is. When he is told by his wife she had dreams of cheating on him, Bill goes out into the night for revenge with two chances of cheating on her but he doesnt and comes across this mysterious group who engage in orgy activities as well as who knows what else but is watched and threatened while those around him that are also in the group get killed in the process, he starts to realize that he doesnt want to cheat and wants to be a much better person than those masked people are for himself and his wifeI dont mean to get a bit religious here and perhaps on my second viewing I wont feel the same way anymore but with my first viewing, it definitely feels like the Devil and his demonic followers are constantly tempting us to turn away from God, saying its ok to sin and you will not be punished. Despite these opportunities Bill had to get revenge on his wife, he cannot bring himself to do that and give into sin, he instead is rewarded by not ending up dead or catching HIV from a hookerThats all I can say for now and Im sure as I rewatch the movie again I will pick up more things and further add to my understanding or perhaps change my perceptive. It's certainly like other Kubrick movies, You'd need to watch more than once. There is so much going on this film that its easy to miss. Overall though it is a very good film, very engaging, thought provoking, intense and amazingI would be remiss if I didnt bring up the fact there is a 24 minute lost footage from this film and while people believe it doesnt exist, it clearly does. Towards the end when Bill discovers the truth as well as trying not to be manipulated by whom he thought was a friend who is also part of this secret group, there are hints Bill saw more than what the final cut of the movie showed which was just people having sex. Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise both know about this lost footage, they know what it is but they arent telling. Very interesting.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"No masterpiece, but a worthy farewell","An intriguing tale of a beautiful everycouple who have it all: perfect looks, perfect daughter, perfect Park Avenue apartment. A perfect life, that is, until the night the everyman discovers that his everywoman...isn't. The wife's shocking revelation of adulterous temptations prompt the husband to embark on a ill-fated nocturnal attempt to shed his everyman status. What follows is a nightmarish odyssey that is both disturbing and mesmerizing. Exhibiting his trademark simultaneous melding of drama, satire, horror and irony, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a fitting memorial to Stanley Kubrick's extraordinary career. The casting of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman may seem like a gimmick or marketing ploy, but they easily acquit themselves, particularly Kidman who impresses in her handful of scenes. Cruise may seem colorless in his role but that is the intent--he's a straight-shooting do-gooder whose self-control is painfully incongruous next to the depravity around him. His attempted membership in seediness is revoked at every turn, hampered by his impenetrable virtue. The much-discussed ""orgy"" sequence is actually pretty tame (compared to like material in much harsher R-rated fare) due to the ridiculous post-production insertion of computer-generated characters discreetly masking certain areas within the frame. Unfortunately, what should have been a truly potent sequence is now distilled into a mere suggestion of the darker side of fortune.

Kubrick has done it again - almost,"'Eyes Wide Shut' is a dense film. I'm not quite sure what means exactly. It's just the feeling you have after you've seen it. The atmosphere in this film is so thick, you could cut it with a knife. Even in the great halls of the ceremonial palaces, the thick atmosphere manages to fill every nook and cranny. It's incredibly engrossing.As an example, consider the scene, where Alice (Nicole Kidman) and William (Tom Cruise) are kissing in front of a mirror in the beginning of the film. Alice is looking at herself in a horny, bad girl way. The light is orange. 'Baby did a bad bad thing' is blaring in the background. It's incredible. If you've seen it, you know what I mean.Stanley Kubrick was one of the great directors. We all know this. His choice of musical score, lighting, camera angles were as effective as they were bold. Where this film fails to reach the heights of 'Dr. Strangelove','Full Metal Jacket','Clockwork Orange' and the other great Kubrick films, is in the plot. The direction is flawless. The acting, especially by Nicole Kidman, is astounding. Whenever she is in a scene, she lights up (or should I say darkens?) the film. The joint scene in particular - I never knew Kidman could actually act! (That said, Tom Cruise seems to be free-wheeling through this film).But the plot. It's mysterious and exciting, but in the end it's disappointing. Again, if you've seen the film you'll know what I'm talking about. It sort of falls flat. You're left with a feeling that nothing really happened, that no character really grew, and that the film was just a blip in the character's lives.Ironic, really. I think Tom Cruise got a bigger story to tell from working with Stanley Kubrick on his last film, than his character in the film would have to tell about his experiences.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

What a way for Kubrick to go out.,"Knowing Kubrick's style of movies, the explicit content in his movies, and the creepy style he does his movies in, I knew this last Kubrick project would be quite a thrill. Dying right after the movie was made, of a heart attack, I had a feeling Kubrick knew the end was near, and decided to go all out before he went out. And what a way to do it. This movie has Kubrick written all over it. This movie intrigued me quite a bit. Although it may seem like a usual Kubrick style movie, it quickly turns into a nonstop series of nude everywhere, and creepiness all around.New York doctor Bill Hartford, (Tom Cruise) has an argument with his wife, (Nichole Kidman) about being faithful with each other one night when they're both stoned after returning from a party. This leads her to reveal at one point in their marriage when she had a sexual fantasy with a man they met on vacation with their daughter, and was ready to give up her future with her husband and daughter just to sleep with him. This causes him to go out in the streets of New York, filled with jealousy and sexual flames, on a nonstop discovery of moral and sexual intercourse.He encounters a hooker, an awkward intrusion of a costume owner's daughter fooling around with two Asians, and a mansion where a ritual of sexual orgies is taking place. All fitting in one night, and continues on the next day, consuming you with tons of confusion, and questions you're just dying to know. By the time most of the more screwed up scenes are finished, they will leave you speechless and filled with curiosity. The hardest part of this film is not knowing whats going on, which can get a little on your nerves.Though it is a little slow, most Kubrick films are. Its not too bad, and it does build up pretty well. The music score by Jocelyn Pook is outstanding. That suspenseful piano piece that shows whenever somethings going on just gets shivers right down your spine.I couldn't believe the amount of nudity in this film. Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, (1971) which is rated X, doesn't even have as much nudity as this, which I didn't think was possible, which is shocking considering Kubrick could have had it much worse, though he decided to block most of the sex shown, for rating issues, though the film is still rated NC-17.A truly terrifying thriller which is one of Kubrick's most shocking, yet highly intelligent drama thrillers, which will have you on the edge of your seat. Although not as good as A Clockwork Orange, its still one of the most thrilling films ever, and will live on in the legend of Stanley Kubrick forever.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
brilliant,"From the second scene in the film, where Alice (Kidman) is shown on the toilet (just something perfectly natural, yet never shown in films) as they're getting ready for the party, you know this is going to be a different kind of a film.From the trailer that I saw so many years ago, with Chris Isaak's 'Baby did a bad bad thing' playing in the background while Cruise/Kidman/Kubrick was displayed in bold writing, I was expecting some sort of sordid, sleazy film. Certainlty some people's opinions are as such too.What I saw was an intriguing depiction of actions and consequences catalysed by events that never even actually happened, but were as damaging as those that did happen. Dr. Bill (Cruise) uses Alice's admission during a hilarious pot smoking scene as his excuse to justify his own desires and fantasies. The first visit to the hooker, leading to Dr.Bill visiting his old friends Jazz Club leading to the bizarrely fantastical ""Costume Party"" sequence are all a consequence of their pot smoking session.I loved how the plot came together, even though it was fairly obvious who the secret helper at the costume party was, and why his pianist friend disappeared the day after. Despite an intense feel to the film, the script and situations and the way they were delivered by those involved, most notably Cruise, consistently put a cheesy grin on my face.The film always kept me at full attention, got better and better and ended on a perfect note, summarising exactly my thoughts about their relationship.Great film",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
a long and strange movie,"i was taken by surprise about this movie because i knew so little about it before going in.  it was hard to get the fact  out of my mind that the main two characters are actually married to each other.  ie- is tom jealous about the sex scenes between nichol and the fantasy sailor?  do they talk like this at home?    anyway, the acting seemed a bit stilted to me, and the basic story was strange to say the least.  it is certainly the voyeur's delight with more full frontal nudity than i have seen in a long time. i would recommend seeing it just by a slim margin.  would be a much better choice overall to wait for the video....",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

My brief review of the film,"A perfectly photographed and superbly directed film about the state of modern marriages and how society is heading, in a world that is becoming increasingly morally decaying. The mystery element of the film provides it with a perfect atmosphere to set up the confused emotions of the main character, and gives the film an intriguing quality. The background music is excellent, and the cast is superb. The emotional state that Tom Cruise is able to bring to his character is totally believable, and film directors Sydney Pollack and Todd Field have interesting supporting roles. The film is nonetheless quite long for the subject matter at hand, but besides for this there is little wrong with the film. Some were repelled by the frequent nudity and sexual content of the film, however without such, this would not be the modern masterpiece it is. Certainly quite a high note for Kubrick to have ended his career on.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Life Is But a (Waking) Dream,"And that is precisely Bill Harford's life, from the moment Marion kisses him at her father's deathbed to his opening a beer in his kitchen in the wee small hours before entering his bedroom and spotting the Venetian mask next to his sleeping wife Alice.Go ahead, try it: Remove all that transpires between these moments. Remove even the mask. Fill in with what you like, or leave it blank. A plot will remain, arguably coherent, likely not as visually arresting, driven or interesting, but unquestionably a context in which to try to understand the prelude and possible coda to a crisis in the relationship between married and child-rearing urban professionals. We know these people, even if they smoke pot and listen to Shostakovich.I've not since seen Tom Cruise so vulnerable or Nicole Kidman so quietly terrifying. Their off-screen relationship, during and after, has no bearing, for this is Stanley Kubrick's waking dream, from the torpor of everyday life in defense of the relentless pursuit of the fleeting and superficial, to the gradual surrender to a visceral, sensual, claustrophobic and candy-colored alternate reality, to eyes forced unwillingly wide open. And we are all made welcome to it, whether we want to or not and whether we like it or not.And when you suddenly awake from a vivid and intensely pleasurable dream, do you not consciously strive to revive, re-create and re-enter it? Bill Harford tries repeatedly.They don't make movies like this any more. I am convinced that for the most part they've stopped trying. Kubrick is doubtless judged by his more famous movies, but such is the true measure of his genius. No other film director convinced me to pay as much attention to what appeared on-screen or want one or more re-viewings to try to see what I'd missed. I wish he was still filming though full well realize I'd likely still await the final cut...I am also convinced Kubrick knew he was dying. The actors' lines are his own. Study his final ruminations on the species in this light. The man was no emotional recluse and could not have died alone.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Kubrick in the era of AIDS,"Kubrick's work has always been topical.  Dr. Strangelove addressed the cold war and government under the shadow of the bomb...very apt for the early 60s.  2001 addressed the space age, the computer age, and expanding consciousness...very apt for the late 60s.  A Clockwork Orange addressed social degeneration and governmental social engineering...very apt for the early 70s.Now he addresses sex in the era of AIDS.  William and Alice Harford experience extramarital yearnings.  Alice, the female, experiences these yearnings in dreams and fantasies.  William, the male, acts out his yearnings, though never quite consummating his passions.  William is warned that his pursuits can bring him death, but he presses on until impeded by forces stronger than he.How perfectly fit this story is for rendition by Stanley Kubrick.  His off-pace editing, eerie sound, and dramatic colors all evoke the dream state that this film is about.  We dream about sexual liaisons, and we are safe in those dreams.  Trouble comes when we act out on them, or even tell our spouses about them.The social message is conservative, pro-monogamy.The reference to Beethoven's opera Fidelio is particularly apt for this theme.  Fidelio is about a woman who dresses as a man and enters into the service of an evil Don to find and free her husband, who had been imprisoned for resisting the tyrant's evil ways.  In EWS, the husband enters the castle seeking to join (not resist) in the evil Don's adventures.  The husband is rejected and is forced to go home, tail between his legs.Perhaps that's Kubrick's parting advice to us all, in the words of Alice Harford: let's go home and [make love to] our spouses.",,Anonymous,Mystery

The mommy and doctor daddy, played by real-life husband and wife superstars, are at a crisis. First they attend a party where they separate for a while. The wife answers a flirting session with flirting of her own and the husband lies about what he's been up to. Later they're home sharing a joint when she tells him about how much she lusted after a random man she saw last summer while they were on vacay. He can't get the images out of his mind and decides to chase offers other women make through his night. Her infidelity was only in her emotions but, as she says, she would give up her husband, her child, her whole life for one night with the random man.

Love it or hate it...,"This film seems to polarize people as no other film does. In all instances when I have asked friends about it, they don't understand the film. I don't either. I never will. But it doesn't keep me from loving the film. As I do with ""Barry Lyndon"", I keep returning to this film finding new things to puzzle over. That, to me, is what makes a Kubrick film stand apart from others.But to some, this lack of easy comprehension makes them a little angry. If they can't easily understand a story - i.e. - they can't explain it to themselves easily, they say ""hate it."" Kubrick, more than any other director, made films that told stories as only film can tell. His films can't be reduced to words.

Brilliant Film,"This is perhaps the most underrated film in existence. It reads like a Greek tragedy in its content of sin (jealousy, envy, etc.), its consequences and the constant Dionysian excess displayed throughout the film. For example, the Doctor's arrogance and the hubris he experiences at the end. A background of simple piano strokes intensifies the dramatic effect. In many ways, the film proceeds like the great classics of the 1940s and 1950s (except for the level of nudity, of course). It's suspense is both brilliant and subtle. It is unfortunate that the masses lack the intellect required to recognize how unique this film is. The film has numerous undertones of ancient Greek plays. The masses, however cannot appreciate a film if it lacks constant special effects and tend to lack understanding of brilliant subtlety.

"Good acting, great directing, but still weak","I loved Nicole Kidman. Alice is a dynamic character and I believe this is a great role for Kidman to show a lot of range. I wish the same could be said for the rest of the characters. Bill Harford (Cruise) is a flat character through the entire movie. You hope for tragedy or heroism (or at least decisiveness), but all I could feel for this character was pity. He is not a character that engages the viewer.This is not to say that Tom Cruise does a bad job. I believe he put the same dramatic talent into this as I saw in Jerry Maguire, a movie that I love. My complaint is that he plays Bill Harford too much like Jerry Maguire. He appears to have found a good character (somewhere around The Firm), and is now bringing it with him to each new job.I am a great fan of extended dramatic pauses, and I believe EWS occasionally makes brilliant use of them. Kidman is not afraid to be silent when it's ""her turn to talk,"" and this is very effective. At least at one point, the audience is aware of things several minutes before the players, which creates a wonderful kind of tension. But as with anything, there can be too much of a good thing, and EWS often goes beyond dramatic pauses into just pauses. Beyond just being a long movie, there is a sense that it really isn't going anywhere. Events that occur during a single morning feel more like they stretch over several days. The slowness of plot might be acceptable if the characters were more engaging, but given that Cruise has so much of the screen time and provides so little for the audience to relate to, it can be hard to stay with the movie the whole time.Music is certainly a very important part of EWS, and the almost abstract nature of the piano pieces could have greatly added to the mood and suspense of the movie. Unfortunately it is often just too loud and jarring to do this effectively.Kubrick fans should certainly see this movie. It is a significant part of a defining career. Those interested in film as an art form should also go see it. There is plenty of material for discussion whether you enjoy the movie or not. Those just interested in a good movie, though, should probably look elsewhere. And despite the amount of nudity in this file, those looking for erotica should definitely look elsewhere.But I still loved Nicole Kidman.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

So this is what Epstein's island looked like...,"Spirited Away, the adult version, is a methodical movie by the acclaimed Stanley Kubrick. A slow gripping fantasy that leaves viewers uncomfortably watching Tom Cruise's character Dr. Bill's psyche unravel. With every scene, Kubrick creates Bill's mind with the distinct purpose to disturb viewers.Like, Spirited Away, we travel into a character's mind as they process developments. Such a format excels in allowing the viewer to fully grasp a character's issues while also observing their own. Movies as a medium depict dreams in an unrivaled way. Immersion and calculated chaos are two qualities film brings to life in portraying dreams.While slowly paced, I was slightly intrigued until the second half where I became glued to the screen. Sometimes a slow pace is needed for the viewer to dive into a character's psyche.Watching this at 2AM left my own psyche vulnerable to deception. I hadn't realized I was watching a dream until the very end of the film. So Kubrick you got me.Also, this is my first Stanley Kubrick film viewing.

Now here is our good doctor (Cruise) helping a naked woman recover from an overdose, sees her a few hours later (as she is apparently hooking on the streets) doesn't recognize her even when he accompanies her to her bedroom to engage her services. And later when this Amazon Hooker attends an orgy she saves him from a fate worse than life.  This particular female had one hell of a constitution to hook, attend an orgy, after she nearly died a few hours earlier.  It does stretch the imagination.

Its really a film about secrets and mysterious things. Characters do things that are unexpected, and ultimately, they pay for it. It shows how one mistake can lead to an even bigger mistake. The twists are well crafted and the dialouge is highly impressive. Masterful directing, rich colors, and a great score. Both actors prove just how much they can become their characters.

Something of a departure,"Having only recently (within the last year or so) become a rabid admirer of Kubrick's work, I was frothing at the prospect of actually seeing one of his films on the big screen.  And even the rush I felt as I watched the big yellow words ""Star Wars"" zoom away on The Phantom Menace's opening night pales in comparison to what I was going through in the minutes before this, Kubrick's final release, unspooled before me.  Roughly an hour later, though, I had pretty much forgotten about the great director and settled into the depths of William Harford's mind and conflicts.  While it lasts, this movie completely immerses its audience.  But somehow, Eyes Wide Shut isn't like Kubrick at all; while his stories usually only use characters to prove a point or make some statement about society, this film attempts to achieve psychological realism in its portrayal of a doctor's sexual escapades and their effects on his marriage.  It's as though the whole movie is just one giant experiment, like Kubrick wanted to see if he could really create a believable human character.  There's still meaning and messages and all that good stuff, but they seem tacked on to the complicated plot and occasionally shocking sexual imagery (which was shamelessly softened to avoid an NC-17 after Kubrick's death by the use of Austin Powers-esque ""covering"" techniques-- let's pray to God they give us the original version on video).  It's a decent movie in and of itself, but a far cry from 2001 or A Clockwork Orange.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Empty, dull and painstakingly boring. A wasted opportunity for all concerned.","The plot line sounded very good for this film. A dreamy, erotic oddessy through Manhattan's seedy underworld. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are the main stars. The film's atmospheric and moody teaser trailers made `Eyes Wide Shut' look a lot better than it actually was. The real result is subtle, boring drivel that only amounts to being a pathetic excuse for cheap pornography.I've never been a fan of Stanley Kubrick's movies and his last piece of completed work hasn't impressed me. There is no creativity in `Eyes Wide Shut', and nothing stands out among the evident dross. Yet people still call this man a genius; the mind boggles. Perhaps the film would have been much better had it been someone else, maybe Martin Scorsese. He's created a hellish yet vivid portrayal of New York in the past and I think he would have done a much better job.Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman's last pairing is indeed they're worst. The main problem is that any less popular actors could have easily replaced them. The chemistry between the two is convincing and ultimately believable, but they know that they could do with better material than this.The pedestrian pace that the film takes and the slow, dull narrative fail to help it either. At 162 minutes, the plot and much-to-subtle dialogue are insufficient for it's length. Sure, Nicole Kidman looks good in her birthday suit, but there's little else good to remember about it. When it tries to be inventive it just ends up being plain weird. Very little can compensate for the misery and despair that it digs itself into.While it is an oddly interesting movie experience it's not one that you will have good memories of. Fans of Kubrick's earlier work might respect it, but most normal people will find this as repulsive as the south end of a magnet.

The Sex Beast in Us,"At first sight Mr. Kubrick's last movie seems to be an erotic thriller with location New York City but in fact it is rather a psychoanalytic report about the sex beast in us that is constantly knocking on our intellectual world. After all, the film is based on the 1926 novella 'Dream Story' by Arthur Schnitzler who has even been admired by Sigmund Freud for his clairvoyant character studies. After having quickly read through the synopsis of the novella I found it actually quite striking how close the script is to the original story apart from the fact that the setting was transferred from Vienna to New York City and from Mardi Gras to Christmas season.It is possible to see in the movie the denunciation of a degenerated upper-class morality, but I think it is much more about our own internal conflict when facing the strength of our libido which is in a way opposed to the moral standards that society imposes on us. Is romantic love and family bliss just an illusion?Both Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise do a good job in showing this internal conflict. Alice appears to be anything but happy when confessing to Bill her sexual phantasies with someone else but still she does so for showing Bill that his somewhat haughty self-conception is based on shaky ground. And Bill's erotic night trip through Manhattan in the very same night is just his reaction to these in his eyes shocking confessions. At the beginning it was maybe just meant to be an escape from home, but it turns more and more into an act of revenge by paying Alice back in her own coin. It fits in well that Tom Cruise usually comes across as someone quite arrogant.Overall, an exceptional movie with a high-end camera work, as we would expect it from a perfectionist like Stanley Kubrick. Reviewing may create new insights into the unconscious.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The final chapter of the book of Kubrick.,"There is no real reason to argue that Stanley Kubrick was one of the finest directors to ever stand behind a camera. From Dr. Strangelove to 2001: A Space Odyssey to Full Metal Jacket, Kubrick was able to polarize and hypnotize the audience with his brilliant composition, camera movement, and incredible storytelling. Here, he explores the human desires to copulate and have intimacy with one another. What is interesting is that this is an issue we all know about and that the movie industry really seems to like, especially these days as practically every film made has a sex scene ore sexual reference in it. For Kubrick, he makes it more of a dream as the plot stretches off into wild and weird sections we weren't expecting and really kind of put us off in a way.As Tom Cruise's character begins to explore the sexual events that surround him throughout the night, the film feels more and more deliberately slow in pace as well as more strange in tone. I believe Kubrick is doing this intentionally in order to plunge us further in the mindset that Dr. Harford is unaware and confused of the events happening to him. That being said, it feels a bit too long and there are some scenes that don't fit with the rest. The first hour is really strong as we view the marriage bonds between the doctor and his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) strain as they both face temptation. As we follow Bill into this fantasy of sexual desires and obsession, the plot gets weirder and the questions pile up. This is not to say Kubrick doesn't wrap things up but not everything is revealed.For me, this was not one of Kubrick's many masterpieces. I did admire the film for its insight on the reason of marriage and the ties it requires between two people. It also is very good in its atmosphere and set-up, which Kubrick always did well. However, I couldn't really get into it but that may be the reason behind the motives. For any Kubrick fan, this is worth checking out, but despite it not being up to his other stuff, there are definite traces of a great film here. It is only too unfortunate that he died so soon. One can only imagine what he would have done next.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
secret masterpiece,"'Eyes Wide Shut' is a multilayered and complex movie. At first glance this is not necessarily obvious. You think it's about the pure disintegration of a marriage. But the longer you think about the movie, the deeper you descend into the unconscious, into the inner self of man and draw further insights from it. You realize what a fascinating work this movie is.A supposedly small event causes Tom Cruise's character to feel a sense of jealousy. That little seed in his head grows into a tree in a flash and throws his life out of whack.What is the significance of human drives?
How can these go hand in hand with societal perceptions?
To what degree is something justifiable?Each person plumbs this limit for himself.The movie is characterized by precisely this inner conflict between societal values and the instincts that are deeply rooted in human beings. These urges cannot always be put into words or concrete ideas, but you know they are there. The main character embarks on a journey that actually lasts only 2 nights, but is perceived much more intensely.This inner conflict, in which way he can satisfy his desire, is depicted with the help of the events shown. This does not mean that what was shown did not take place. It merely serves as a bridge, a parallelism to clarify the inner events.The movie deals with complex processes in a human being, but in such a way that it remains comprehensible for the viewer. The longer you think about the movie, the more facets you recognize. That's what I like about this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Doctor and the Wife,"Out of the wondrous imaginative mind of Stanley Kubrick comes this erotic tale of successful doctor William Harford (Tom Cruise) who believes he and his beautiful wife (Nicole Kidman) are a modern uninhibited and sophisticated couple. That all changes when the pair pauses a moment in their sedate and upscale life to smoke a joint. The husband reviews their evening at a fancy ball and reveals he was hit on by a couple of gorgeous women, but had the strength and fortitude to resist their invitation and charms. Taking his cue, the wife reveals that she too was invited to a sexual rendezvous and considered it just another of the many flirts she daily encounters. In fact, she further reveals, she's often had several wild fantasies involving herself and a handsome ship's Captain. This awakens and disturbs the doctor who believes there is much more to the sexual world of his wife which he is not privy to. Intrigued by the possibilities, he begins a personal but dangerous Odyssey to discover the dark secret world of the sexually provocative. The question arises. Can one delve into the black depths of perversion without losing himself? Eyes Wide Shut is a spellbinding foray of spectral images, complete with an equally haunting theme. All in all, a strange but alluring film where one discovers that enlightenment comes not without a price. ****",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The main advantage of ""Eyes Wide Shut"" however is that it is always subject to a further analysis or renewed insights as it covers all the aspects of our individual consciousness.

Do we constantly have to close our eyes to our true nature? Is hypocrisy the only means of reaching a higher level? Is beauty but a mere dream and a negation of what we really are?

I've only seen 4 of his films (2001, Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket and this) and I think that FMJ is still his best film, but this is still worth seeing.Doctor William Harford (Tom Cruise) becomes obsessed with having a sexual encounter after his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) admits to having sexual fantasies about a man she met and chastising William for dishonesty in not admitting to his own fantasies. This sets him off into unfulfilled encounters with a dead patient's daughter and a hooker. But when he visits a nightclub, where a pianist friend Nick Nightingale (Todd Field) is playing, he learns about a secret sexual group and decides to attend one of their congregations. However, he quickly learns he is in well over his head and finds he and his family is threatened.Cruise and Kidman are good in this, and Kubrick brings a very dark view suggesting that powerful people are involved in orgies (that's what I think anyway). Even a man they knew well was involved. They kind of state the obvious in the dialog often, but it's forgivable. Some people think the whole thing was William's dream, but I think it was all real. The 1st time I saw this, I thought it was rubbish, but I watched it again and thought it was good. It's not fantastic, but worth watching.Rating: 3/5",,Anonymous,Mystery
More Questions than Answers but we miss Kubrick!,"I was a bit disappointed because I felt that I still need to know more about the party. I wanted to shake Sydney Pollack's character and asked him more questions. Why was he there? How do you join? Is it a secret club? What was the purpose of the red caped man? All I could think of was that the red caped man was a leader of a satanic cult. The music and the chanting of the words. Now if this was some kind of party, why did they have such creepy music and chanting. Then some of the masked guests or participants removed their capes, the women were beautiful but practically naked with only their masks and bikini bottoms. Then they all started touching each other as the music and chanting continued. Once they were done, they went off with the other cloaked men. We saw scenes of debauchery (I hope I use it properly) at this mysterious mansion. Naked women mostly and few naked men engage in sordid lovemaking. Of course, Pollack's character only hinted that the masks were protect the identities of the rich and powerful at these parties. No matter what, what was a prostitute doing there? When one woman risks herself to save Tom's character, we are expected to believe it was all an act. Come on, I can't believe that Tom's character was just playing a role in dark play. I'm sorry but I have so many questions about the house, the party, and the participants which left me kind of disappointed. While I love Kubrick, the film is worth watching but not for children or for the squeamish. We miss you Kubrick, wherever you are.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I don't get it,"Well I'm a long-time Kubrick fan, almost all of his movies are among my all-times favorite, mainly ""2001"", ""Clockwork Orange"" and ""Lolita"".I've seen each Kubrick movie at least 12 times *LOL*, even ""The Killer's kiss"" despite its numerous technical flaws and goofs.I don't understand what's happened with ""Eyes wide shut"". Not only this is Kubrick's less enjoyable movie I ever saw, but I actually found it boring! Incredible...I suspect the horrible performance given by Tom Cruise is partly responsible. I never saw such an unconvincing character (Apart from cheap TV-movies ones). Cruise was definitely NOT the guy. Too shallow. A friend of mine told me this was probably on purpose, well OK but what's the point then? He couldn't tell!!Maybe someday I'll understand Kubrick's purpose and understand the real meaning of this movie. Until then, apart from the gorgeous scenes when Bill arrives at the ""party"", and the overall ""Kubrick's eye"" magnificence, I'm still considering ""Eyes wide shut"" as the most bitter disappointment I ever had about cinema.Rating 6/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Eyes Wide Shut falls short of being a masterpiece but remains entertaining and worthy of a watch,"I recently revisited Eyes Wide Shut (1999) on Tubi. The plot revolves around a doctor discovering his wife's infidelity, leading him to explore his curiosities and infiltrate an underground sex club.This film is directed by the icon Stanley Kubrick (The Shining), and features notable performances from Tom Cruise (Top Gun), Nicole Kidman (Moulin Rouge), Sydney Pollack (Tootsie), Todd Field (Tar), and Madison Eginton (Angel).This is one of those films that is fun to watch unfold and can be enjoyed for what it is. The premise is solid and has some smart, full circle elements. The acting is excellent as Cruise delivers an authentic performance and Kidman delivers several, ""well hello, Nicole Kidman,"" moments. She is absolutely stunning. The models they selected are gorgeous too. I do wish the cult was more intense to create a better ""gravity"" over the circumstances. I did enjoy the ending and overall solution.In conclusion, Eyes Wide Shut falls short of being a masterpiece but remains entertaining and worthy of a watch. I'd give it a 7.5/10 and strongly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"If you can keep your eyes open, you might learn something.","This isn't an easy film to sit through...slow-moving, laborious, and downright frustrating at over 2 1/2 hours...but strangely enough, it's a film you can't help thinking about days afterward.The plot and underlying theme of this movie are simple...nothing is what it appears to be.  Tom and Nicole play a seemingly happily married couple with an extravagant life and a beautiful child; it all looks good on the surface. But a late-night argument with Nicole leads Tom to doubt the security of his marriage, sending him on an all-night mission to break his vow of monogamy.As you watch the film, nothing much appears to happen.  At times, things move excruciatingly slow. When it's all over, though, you realize what you've been watching is an illusion and that you the viewer have been through a tremendous emotional experience.Nicole Kidman, one of today's most underrated actresses, is terrific as Alice Harford, a woman hiding her feelings behind a facade of matrimonial and matriarchal bliss.  Tom Cruise, on the other hand, can't quite pull off the darkness of Bill Harford.Stanley Kubrick uses the camera like a paintbrush, creating a beautiful visual and emotional landscape.  Now if he had only realized that it's 1999 and the vast majority of the movie-going audience tires quickly of naked Playboy bunny bodies on display, this film would have more appeal.  Instead, it seems as if Kubrick was obsessed with women's breasts and rear ends...to the point that he looked for any excuse to get them into frame.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Multilayered sexual mystery movie,"Along with ""Fight Club"", ""The Matrix"", and ""American Beauty"", 1999 really was a year of films that aimed to reveal that not all is real as it appears to be. ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is no different in that regard.This film is a slow burner. As with most Kubrik films, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is heavy on the symbolism and visual references as it leads us around it's dreamlike world. Many references so tiny and nuanced that they're like easter eggs when you find them. The dialogue is a bit stilted in places, but in others there is some very clever innuendos in play. The film only really opens up to the attentive viewer upon repeated viewings.It is about a married doctor who slowly starts realizing that something is amiss in his marriage to his wife, only he just doesn't know what exactly. What follows is a sequence of events that he stumbles through - all seemingly trying to tell him something - but only for his cognitive dissonance to get in the way. Hence the ""Eyes Wide Shut"" title of the film.He attends two parties over the course of the film. One which is superficially socially acceptable, and a private one which clearly is not. If you understand what both of these parties represent then you're halfway to understanding the film and what it seeks to communicate. If you still don't get it, then perhaps some film analysis or manosphere blogs can explain for you.As all great art does, this film will disturb the comfortable and comfort the disturbed.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A Strange, Bizarre and Intriguing Story","In Manhattan, the successful Dr. William ""Bill"" Harford (Tom Cruise) lives in a fancy apartment at Central Park and has been married for nine years with his wife Alice Harford (Nicole Kidman), who worked at an art gallery that closed. They have a seven-year-old daughter, Helena Harford (Madison Eginton), and have a happy marriage. When they go to a Christmas party promoted by their friend Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack), Alice dances and flirts with a stranger, the Hungarian Sandor Szavost (Sky Dumont), while Bill flirts with two models. Bill sees that the pianist of the band is his former friend from college, Nick Nightingale (Todd Field) and talks to him, but Nick has an appointment and gives the address where he is playing since he lives in Seattle. Out of the blue, Victor calls Bill since the young woman Mandy (Julienne Davis) has just had an overdose while having sex with him, but Bill helps her and she lives. On the next night, Bill and Alice smoke marijuana and the stoned Alice tells him that she considered the possibility of having an affair with the naval officer she met during vacation. Bill is still disturbed by Alice's confessions and is called by his client's daughter Marion (Marie Richardson), who tries to seduce him. While walking on the streets of New York City, Bill meets the prostitute Domino (Vinessa Shaw) and goes with her to her apartment, but Alice calls him, and he just pays Domino. He continues to wander and stumbles upon Nick's jazz club. When Nick ends his show, he drinks with Bill and tells him that he must leave him since she will play blindfolded at a mansion for a secret society that promotes masked orgies. Bill sees the password to access the mansion and forces Nick to say the address. Nick tells him that he needs a mask and costume to go, but Bill succeeds in getting them. He hires a taxi driver and heads to the mansion. He enters, and soon he is warned by a masked woman to leave the place since the people is dangerous. Bill does not leave the mansion and soon he learns the price for staying in the orgy.""Eyes Wide Shut"" (1999) is an erotic mystery film and the swan song by Stanley Kubrick with Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise in the lead roles. Nicole Kidman (1.80 m height) is a stunner in the role of a housewife full of desires. She is out of the of Tom Cruise league (1.70 m height), who performs but does not convince as a successful doctor, keeping the face and smile of a good doctor most of the time. Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger would certainly be a more indicated couple. The plot is strange and bizarre, totally original, but an actor like Antonio Banderas would be more indicated as a romantic pair of Nicole. The story is bizarre but intriguing, keeping the attention of the viewer until the very ending. But is indicated only to specific audience, since it is erotic and provocative.

"Half brilliant, half horrible!","Stanley Kubrick's reputation of course relies upon other films, and this one is more likely to impress film students for techniques than any audiences most likely to be disappointed when they are drawn into the odd connection between Kubrick and some major movie stars more than thirty years his junior (Cruise and Kidman) who have no other connections to him. I must admit that for the first thirty minutes all I could think was ""What a piece of pretentious rubbish! How could Kubrick soil himself with this?"", and then it grew upon me, but not in time to convince me that Kubrick didn't make one film too many (this one) or should have made some other movie as his unintended swan song. The result is mediocrity: half masterful, and half amateurish.As usual for Kubrick, set design is consistently masterful. Enough of this movie grates on me to damage the rest. This is not an early work of a promising filmmaker; this is the last complete work of a decayed master. Perhaps, as with the other master Hitchcock, his taste failed him as he aged. Perhaps he fell in love with a novel that he thought needed a cinematic treatment -- and bit off far more than he could chew.Kubrick moves an expressionist novel set in Germany or Austria across an ocean and nearly a century later in New York City in the 1990s, and he gets some interesting results. Interesting, but not wholly-satisfying. Expressionism, over the top a century ago, is silly today even if recent art has gone even more over the top.First of all, Kubrick's mastery of set design gives a beauty to an ugly story, half pornographic and half a brilliant mystery, and the opulence makes the ugliness of much of the behavior all the more troublesome. The chilly personas of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman (and this is deliberate) underscore the ominous qualities of the film.I find the short, and potentially deadly, excursion of the clinical Dr. Hartford (Cruise) into the secret (Satanist?) ceremony by overhearing a password a bit contrived. Then again, expressionism itself is obsolete because it is contrived; what was over the top then is what alienated risk-seekers search almost routinely.Kubrick took a chance, and this one spun out of control. For good reason Expressionism did not become more than a cultural fad, dying out about twenty years after its introduction.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I can't believe I watched the whole thing....,"I can't believe that Tom Cruise and Nichole Kidman could have lowered themselves to do such a horrid movie. If you can stay awake through all the street walking and driving around in the car scenes you are rewarded by conversations between characters you don't even care about,  Tom Cruise's blank stares and Nichole Kidman's whinny, crying, stupid dreams were just too much. If Stanley Kubrick set out to make another really bizzare film he missed the mark on this one. It could have been a whole lot better. The whole movie was a let down. As far as this supposedly being a thriller, I wasn't  thrilled. Thrill is created when something dangerous is possibly going to happen to a character that as been developed  in such a way that you CAN care about them. As I said, I couldn't have cared less about these people. If there was suppose to be some kind of psychological lesson to learn it was all to vague and scattered to grasp with any clear cut definition.I can only figure that it's the nudity, unbridled sex and sexual fantasy that getting the ""10"" ratings from the men. If the sex and female nudity were not such a big part of this film I doubt that many men could have stayed awake through it! If you want to watch a film with real psycological questions, rent ""What Dreams May Come"", a film about real love, with top notch cinematography and characters you can care about.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The aesthetics are impeccable, with an art direction and photography that really transports you to the protagonist's world.

The outcome is intriguing and provocative, but it may leave some viewers with more questions than answers.In short, it's a movie that's really worth watching, especially if you appreciate a psychological thriller with a unique approach.

A Classic,"One of the most underrated films of all time, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is the result of an intense collaboration between Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman and Stanley Kubrick. Its title suggests an elusive meaning, a conundrum. And that is what the film delivers as presented from the viewpoint of its protagonist, Dr. William Harford (Tom Cruise).Kubrick delivers a visually stunning piece of cinema---with its striking emphasis on color and light---wrapped around an odyssey that is laid over a tale of domestic disquiet. Just as some films include numerous memorable quotes, EWS includes numerous images that stick with you forever.The theme of the film is about the structures of society and its conventions, like marriage, which overlay the raw realities of the human psyche. It is a film of manners that lies like a thin veneer over the uncertainties and brutalities of uncivilized man that always lurk where we dare not look. But EWS dares and provokes us to follow its exploration of the seams of civility, the indulgences that few can afford. It seems to say, like Eliot's Prufrock, ""Let us go then, you and I..."" I refer you to the rest of that stanza which seems so relevant here.The film also has a cadence that draws you in. Moments of calm and enchanting certainty are punctuated by scenes of confusing happenstance and a nagging insistence that some upheaval impends. Dream-like beauty always seems to be on the verge of interruption. This is a meditation on the investments and sacrifices we make to achieve happiness, success, or the tranquility of perceived certainty.EWS includes some wonderful supporting performances in addition to its captivating starring roles. Particularly noteworthy is the performance of Leelee Sobieski, who plays a girl of mysterious circumstances and intentions.Perhaps one day this film will sit atop the popular lists that enshrine the best of cinema where it deserves to be.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Aesthetic and evanescent, 8 1/2 out of 10","This picture brings interesting ideas, is beautifully filmed, with aesthetism and almost mannerism for some scenes. It does not give all the answers, which I really like, and leaves space for some fantasy, which is what the film is really about.The story does not want to be true nor event realistic. Journey in the mind of a man:  one night he sees and witnesses different things, the morning after it seems that the photographs of all the places and situations have turned negative and reveal an new reality.The idea of death dominates the whole film, love, sex and jealousy are perceived as ways to be reassured that we are not dead. This is his obsession. You can see it because he seems to keep passive, just watching what is happening. At the beginning, he comes close to seeing Amanda (the party girl) dying, then he is called because one of his patient is dead, whose daughter seems to obsessively desire him. He gives up with the idea of having sex with Domino (the street prostitute) and the day after he finds out she was HIV positive. He meets again Amanda, at the morgue this time.I personally think that close to the end, when he finds his wife asleep close to the mask he was wearing on his pillow, he pictures the representation of his own death, and this is what makes him cry, nothing else.Obsessive score,but it has to be, they are obsessive ideas. Some scenes are a too long, but it is worth seeing a second time to pick more subtleties I presume.This film does not show any splattered blood, dismembered nor disembowelled body, no brain material, no murder, no violence, no situation that could trigger first degree nightmare, sex only between consenting adults. In other words, lots of space for censure. Still, in our society that tolerates depiction of 1001 different ways of killing someone, the noise and fuss made about one or two representations of ways of making love and maybe creating life is understandable.Understandable, maybe, sensible, certainly not.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An Ambitious Failure,"It is unfortunate that Stanley Kubrick, one of the few contemporary cinematic masters, failed to leave us with a work properly deserving of its position as his ultimate artistic statement. If Kubrick had not died four days after completing 'Eyes Wide Shut', this eagerly awaited addition to his remarkable roster of films would have suffered the fate of Martin Scorcese's 'After Hours'-  to be first defended, then dismissed as an unsuccessful experiment by a director of genius. The film begins well, immediately seducing the viewer with its visual beauty and leisurely pace. Aided by an appealingly edgy soundtrack, it soon proceeds to constrict itself into a tense knot of psycho-sexual suspense. Whereupon it suddenly loses its way. And stays lost. For a very long time. Following a path from provocative to disturbing to annoying to ludicrous, and finally, to tedious, the film then doggedly stumps on for another 3/4 hour.  While impossible to recommend not seeing it, 'Eyes Wide Shut' leaves little recourse, other than to suggest following its screening with a trip to the video store to check out 'Barry Lyndon', 'Lolita' or 'The Shining'.

Blame it on the gossips!,"Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise in a Kubrick's movie? Well, everybody read and heard many things about it, but you know what KUBRICK means in a motion picture. When he was not perfect like he was in ""2001"" and ""A Clockwork Orange"", he was high above the average like in ""Lolita"" and ""The Shining"", for example. In addition, Kidman and Cruise are not only the most gorgeous couple of the movies but they are, indeed, very talented. Then Kubrick died, what meant that it was the last chance to see a new production with his name. Mix these facts with all the gossip that came before the movie itself and so here it is: the most awaited movie of the year, along with Star Wars, maybe.These facts are well known, but you have to recall them cause it explains why some of the Kubrick's fans got a little disappointed with ""Eyes Wide Shut"". It's not a fine situation cause, usually, you don't know where the emotions of the related facts end and where starts the impact of the movie itself. Besides, you will never get surprised cause you expect nothing less than the best.Well, the movie is a genius' work, no doubt about it. In the beginning, you may feel a little strangeness: Kidman and Cruise seem a little dislocated. Wouldn't they bear the responsibility of being in a Kubrick's movie? No way. When the scene of Kidman's confession gets, this problem is already gone and then the rhythm starts to flow in Kubrick's way. It's a delightful experience.Moreover, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is not in the same level as ""2001"", but what kind of movie would be?

A dabble in the occult,"For a Stanley Kubrick film, this one is very different to his earlier works, at least those that I've seen. It's disappointing to say that this final stroke is probably his worst film. Not to say that it's all bad, but it pales in comparison to films such as THE SHINING, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and DR STRANGELOVE. EYES WIDE SHUT tells the story of a married couple living in New York City who are experiencing some marital trauma. The husband, played by Tom Cruise, goes on a strange tour of the sexual underground of NYC, and although he never actually has sex with anyone but his wife, he becomes entangled with some bizarre cult populated by solemn figures in black cloaks, hoods and masks. We never get to find out much about this cult, but maybe that's a part of the film's alluring sense of the mysterious. It seems to represent a break away from the mundane drudgery of everyday life, and a risky dabble in the occult. But unfortunately it's nothing special; by far the most skilfully directed scene was the one in which Cruise infiltrates the cult and bears witness to their eerie and somewhat disturbing rituals, but the rest of the film had a somewhat plodding pace. Kidman's acting left much to be desired; even in scenes when she was supposed to be sober she had a habit of talking very slowly. Quite a mild film when compared to Kubrick's other works. Still quite entertaining and, as it were, a break away from the mundane drudgery of everyday Hollywood movies, and a risky dabble in more unusual films.

Disappointed,"This movie was very disappointing. The first thing that bothered me was the script. I expected quality writing, but it wasn't there. Then there was the acting. There were scenes where the audience was on the edge of their seats alright, but it was because we wanted them to hurry up and say the next word! An overheard comment when the movie was over summed it up nicely, ""It was as if the director said 'Count to three between each word!'""Then there was the annoying single-note piano playing. Piano soundtracks have worked with other Cruise films, but in this one, it was just plain irritating.We get to see a lot of Nicole Kidman in the nude, but there is really very little sex. Yes, there's an orgy scene, but they've edited the film to place other people in strategic spots so you can't see anything. Some people want to see ""Tom and Nicole together."" Forget it. The one 'teaser' scene you see in the previews is all you're going to get. You see them with their tops off, and he starts to kiss her neck. Then she gets p***ed off and that's the end of that. You never see Tom have sex with *anyone*.Another irritating point is when Nicole is smoking pot. She (the actress) must have never smoked, because her reaction is totally wrong. She seems to talk even slower than she did before, and then starts getting angry. 'Tom' comments ""It's just the pot making you aggressive.""

After watching it for the second time I may go watch some of the videos.Obviously lot of lights early, and Stanley was clearly making known shapes with some of the white lights.But there was a brief Christmas Tree lighting to the white lights, which was on for many minutes, right until Nicole's character leaves, and Tom's character meets his old friend.Once both of the characters leave each other there are Christmas lights, and also the shapes behind Tom & his buddy just before 6:30 into the movie, or in that area.Later there are different camera video as he is running around. And much to follow with the colors.Nicole really did a great job acting in this video, which is what Stanley did in the past. For example, Full Metal Jacket took more than one year to shoot, in part because much of the movie was filmed near his house.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Well it's Kubrick film, that's for sure.","This must be THE weirdest film I've ever (or at least American film). In my opinion Kubricks 2001, is understandable in comparison. Now I'm giving this movie a 7/10 because it's a Kubrick film, and I admit that I probably missed the point. Nverteless the acting was great and I liked the character development in the film. The exact meaning of the characters experiences I did NOT get at all. But I'm sure one day I'll see the film again and say: ""aha, now I get it"". that's how 2001 was for me, and I doubt this will be an exception.A little warning for you who are afraid of graphic films. There is a LOT of nudity in this film. Almost to the point of being humorously weird I thought. The main subject of this film is SEX. And for some scenes that's about it. Never before have I seen a film with so much sex, orgy's, full and partial nudity. Why this is in the film I don't know, I'll probably figure that out one day as well.I must say this is not a bad final movie for Kubricks great career. It is as stunning and mysterious and symbolic as all of his movies. And he probably took the answer to this secret to his grave as well, so we may never fully know.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A mystery worth solving,"This is the only Kubrick film that I've watched so far that I can say I really enjoyed watching. This movie is unlike any you will ever watch. The thing that I found most interesting is that this movie is very long, feels long and yet I never wanted it to end. This movie is one where you watch it and you never know what is coming next. Predictability goes out the window in this movie. Tom Cruise gives one of his best performances in this movie and I loved watching his character on screen figuring things out as we the audience figure it out. Complaints come down to the score and there are a few scenes where there is a lot of dialogue being swapped between characters and the pace slows. This is a solid film overall and one that I highly recommend for those who are a fan of Kubrick and or Cruise.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Nice,"Kubrick once again showing why he's one of the best directors of all time, every minimalist detail is purposefully placed where it is it's fantastic to see how he manages to tell us so much more than we can hear. The film itself doesn't appeal to everyone because it's a bit slow, slow, and doesn't have something as shocking as a twist that leaves you in awe! But we learn many things here, where after all will be the end of the rainbow, will we live a rainbow while there is a reality behind? It's just one of the questions this genius director leaves us.Film seen on the 7th to the 8th of July 2021.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"An outstanding,unforgettable film.","There are few films which stir emotions and the imagination every time you watch them .. this is definitely one of them. The film has a dream-like quality which immerses the viewer from start to finish. The storyline follows a few traumatic days in the life of a New York doctor (Cruise) as he stumbles into a dangerous world of secret orgiastic gatherings attended by the rich and powerful of society. Throughout, a crisis in the marriage between the doctor and his wife (Kidman) provide food for thought on the nature of marriage and sexual fidelity. The direction by Kubrik is impeccable and the acting by Cruise and Kidman is excellent but it is the vivid cinematography and musical score which sets this film apart from most. My only question .. what is a Mexican lap dance ?",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
If you've been in a relation/ married quite some now.. u can't afford to miss this,"Storyline is very powerful. A common story yet leaves you with a thoughtful note. After the movie, u shall definitely have an interesting debate, and maybe a fruitful one if your wife's the one you watched this movie with.Definitely, IT IS A ""DO NOT MISS"" Movie for all couples - married or in a relation. It shows how inner love/ sexual desires shape up and what they say/ mean/ interpret/ signify.I say this on this movie: 1.> All that glitters is not gold. And seeing is not believing maybe. 2.> Love rulez...From the point of view of acting; Cruise's at his very best. Superb acting! All the co-stars actually.The movie revolves on a simple plot. Nothing extraordinary. We all know it. Quite predictable. But the way it is presented by Kubrick, I must say one is compelled into introspection. The movie leaves a powerful message behind. Very Very Powerful!!The movie has nothing to have made to Oscars or Big Screen Awards, yet it's a recommended movie for all. I rate the movie 7.5/10 actually. But the mood of the movie is like you can't watch it over and again in a few years kind. So, i rated it lower - 6/10.When u got no really really great movie to watch, don't waste time on freaky DVD's... Just get this great movie... Good Luck!",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I was underwhelmed.,"Like any serious student of film for me ""Eyes Wide Shut"" was easily the most anticipated film of the year and maybe the decade. Stanley Kubrick directed my favorite film of all-time, ""2001"", another Top 10, ""A Clockwork Orange"", and all-time classics, ""Dr.Strangelove..."", ""Paths Of Glory"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"". But alas EWS falls far short of those dizzying high points. It begins brilliantly with a fascinating and dreamy party where the psycho-sexual landscape is set up as precisely as a chessboard and the play is engaged between Dr. Harford and his wife Alice. The opening moves are typical Kubrick and therefore masterful, but then it devolves into a game I really didn't care about. The much talked about orgy scene looks like it came from Red Shoes Diaries. There are some great looking bodies in it (even in the altered US version --which is another story in itself), but what was intended to be shocking was less adventurous than things we've seen on HBO's Real Sex series. I didn't care about Harford and his wife. Tom Cruise does well with what he can in his role but like most of Kubrick's main characters he is an icon rather than a real person. Stanley has gotten away with this more than any other director in history, but here it doesn't work. Nicole Kidman is the best thing about the movie but she dissappears in the second half of it except to come on in time to utter what will go down as one of the most memorable closing lines ever. Kubrick's death is a huge loss for film and filmgoers. His passing hit me harder far more than Di, JFK Jr. and John Lennon, but it doesn't make EWS more than a better than average movie. I would've love to have seen AI.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

From beginning to end, the camera work, cinematography, acting, film editing, soundtrack, and story development are exquisite.In the story Kubrick combines the intense subject of human sexuality with the frightening suspense of a secret society; all done in the powerful Kubrick reality style.

Kubrick's final masterpiece,"Sadly this was Stanley Kubrick's final film.Despite not directing a film for some 12 years, and taking some 2 years to shoot and complete this film. Kubrick has lost none of his skill to make a first rate film that deals with a complex human issue is a dispassionate and objective way, yet keeps the film accessible, entertaining and most importantly, staying in the mind of the viewer long after having seen it.Kubrick's film is a study of the human condition, from the perspective of how sex is part of a relationship. It also makes a statement of how human life is viewed in the higher echelons of society, and seems to indicate it is a commodity to enjoy, and then dispose of, with little or any emotional energy being invested. Cruise gives a compelling performance with more restraint than a typical for him and watching his character put himself into temptation is interesting. However Nicole Kidman is more than a match her husband in the acting department with a very effective and charismatic performance - their initial, immature drug fuelled argument in the bedroom is very effective and her character viciously demolishes the world-view and confidence of the Tom Cruise character. While the focus of the film is on the Bill Harford, Kidman's interactions with Cruise are always charged and riveting.As to other performances, they are all competent, albeit Rade Sherbedgia's broad performance is clearly the amusing dark comic relief in the film, which works well and is definitely needed. Actor/director Todd Field and Sky Dumont are engaging in small parts but its the late Sydney Pollack who is commanding as Victor Zielger and is charismatic and totally amoral in the main supporting role.Technical credits, as usual for a Kubrick film are first rate. Larry Smith's photography, no doubt enhanced by Kubrick's own outstanding knowledge of lighting is excellent, especially as this was Smith's first film as a Director of Photography. He had previously worked on the lighting crews on both Barry Lyndon and The Shining. He has gone on to by the lighting cameraman on a wide variety of projects after this film. Kubrick also shows he is the master of Steadicam, ably supported by veteran operator Elizabeth Ziegler. Nigel Galts editing is also very slick and polished. Joceyln Pook's music, supplemented with pre-existing music tracks, no doubt chosen or influenced by Kubrick himself is effective in creating a dark and disturbing mood.However, as with many Kubrick films, its the outstanding production design that is the greatest technical achievement. Led by Les Tomkins and Kubrick veteran Roy Walker they create a world that is totally convincing - after all the film's first unit shot entirely in the UKIn summary this film is an appropriate and final outstanding achievement for possibly the most technically yet sophisticated and challenging visual storyteller I have come across watching movies.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good, but hopelessly flawed.","I'm not a Kubrick fan. I'm not going to bend over backwards to praise this movie because I still feel the man is in love with his own directing style. Still, this movie is good.It's not great, but it's good.There's real meaning and wisdom in this movie and metaphor aplenty. It isn't for everyone but I felt it was intelligent and if you get it, you'll like it. Sydney Pollack's performance seems to be the best one in the movie, and for once, I don't disagree with Kubrick's direction. For the most part.One of the problems is the movie is horribly paced and could have ended at 100 minutes instead of 158. It tacks on an extra hour of basically unnecessary story. Some of it is important, such as how the movie begins starkly likening unsafe sex to death. It's well-done, provocative, and intelligent. But it's too long.Another issue I have with the movie is with the two stars, Cruise and Kidman. There isn't much chemistry between them and whenever they're close to each other, it has this dry ""yeah yeah, we've done this before"" feeling to it. No real passion. Cruise proves once and for all in this picture that he cannot act. He is incapable of it. He gives a hollow performance comparable to Christian Bale's in ""American Psycho."" The difference here is that Bale's was intentional and effective, whereas Cruise's is simply empty and inept. Kidman seemed to ham it up a little too much for my tastes when she was intoxicated in this movie, and for the rest of the movie did her very best ""I wanna be Julianne Moore"" impression. We could have had better performances and more amiable characters if they'd actually cast Christian Bale and Julianne Moore. Cruise's Dr. Harford is weak and spineless; Kidman's Alice Harford is vile and sadistic.I think another thing that bothered me about this movie was how gratuitous some of the nudity was. A lot of it, such as Alice Harford undressing in the opening credits, was unnecessary. I'm a man, I like naked ladies, but the movie bordered on gratuitous at points. If you want to make a statement, don't throttle it with eye candy.Ultimately a great deal of the plot is grossly unrealistic and exceedingly hard to swallow. You'll have trouble believing most of it.But with all that's wrong with Eyes Wide Shut, there's still a very real, very potent story and message in it. I don't know what exactly it is to assimilate from this movie, but you will feel something from it.I just wish this story had been given more capable hands to mold it. Kubrick, Kidman, and Cruise have nearly ruined what could have been a much better movie.I give it a 6/10. An A for effort, D for execution.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Can Reality be just a Dream & a Dream be a reality in it's own way,"This masterpiece is a study in what a world a film can create. Simply a dream like world.It's not just a piece of film but a creation of an universe in its own. The pieces of edited shots can be broken into its genesis from Blocking to Set Design to Lighting keeping a color temperature to it's story. Having an intricate sound mix to it's classic sexy noiric piano synths, really rising the tension. It's christmas, hence another reason for the film to be colorful & open to unlimited layered stories. From his wife's dream to his reality which seems like a dream. Why? Does it seem like a dream. Why? Because the events occurred in this film, can only happen in a film. All created in a rented film studio with a film crew. Sorry, I know the film is yelling Renaissance Architecture & we know Stanley's love for classical architecture & art. I mean this film is a genre in itself. This dream like reality is great study in direction as the characters seem slower & intense than other films i have seen. It seems like Kubrick didn't rush anything. He tried to keep it as real as possible. Audience feeling like they are part of a 2 hour epic. Who makes an audience feel like that anymore. With its music to static melodramatic & tired performances with a charisma that only actors with a lot of experience can bring. Completely losing themselves in this people.

"9.3/10 - A Hazy, Amazing Journey Through Lust and Love","-Now, where exactly are we going...exactly?-Where the rainbow ends.-Where the rainbow ends?-Don't you wanna go where the rainbow ends?-Well, now that depends on where that is.-Well, let's find out.""In Eyes Wide Shut, Stanley Kubrick tells the story of a married couple, Bill (Tom Cruise) and Alice (Nicole Kidman) Hardford, as a confession Alice makes to Bill about a sexual fantasy she had about a stranger shakes their relationship to the core. Bill, who (due to some archaic beliefs he had on female mindset and sexuality) is deeply shocked by the discovery that his wife happen to fantasize on strangers, and as a result goes on a hazy and dangerous journey to discover his true feelings about his marriage and sexuality. Sounds odd perhaps, but it makes sense when you watch the film.Like many other Kubrick films I happened to watch before (The Shining being a prime example of that), Eyes Wide Shut is wonderfully DENSE. I don't mean by that that the film is too messy, too hard to follow or too chaotic. What I mean is that those willing to dive into this film will find so much. Eyes Wide Shut explores so many themes and ideas in such a terrific way. Dreams, lust in the shade of the mundane, marriage, love, the impact money has on us, status, gender differences - all of which are explored and portrayed in awesome ways here. I really do feel like I could talk about this film for a long, long time, and still only scratch the surface.On the technical level, this film is absolutely stunning. So many beautiful shots. Some warm, some hazy, some terrifying. The set is perfect, the way Kubrick uses color here is no less than ingenius, the score is odd and somewhat off and it adds so much to the dream-like vibe of this film. Cruise and Kidman both give amazing performances here, too. I've heard quite a lot about how Kubrick pushes actors to their limit, even if it means being somewhat emotionally abusive towards them. Kidman and Cruise gave in completely to Kubrick here in order to create this film, and it honestly turned out the best way possible.The only thing that may be seen as an issue here is maybe the slow, slow delivery of dialogue here. I get why it's there and I honestly love the dreamy, hazy vibe it gives this film, but I do acknowledge that it makes this film harder to swallow and less accessible. Again, I don't tale issue with it at all, it only means that you shouldn't watch this film when you're tired and unfocused cause the line delivery here may put you to sleep quite quickly.So put on your glasses, lean back and let yourself fall into the mirror, follow the rainbow, discover the bluish-reddish depths of Eyes Wide Shut. This film is a must (well, for anyone who can take EXTREMELY graphic scenes). It's a slow burn, but when it clicks it clicks hard. I'm feeling a 9.3/10 on this one.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Eyes wide open to our feelings reality.,"Don't close your eyes to this motion picture. Eyes Wide Shut really deserves your attention, as the Academy Awards'. Not because this is the last production by  director Stanley Kubrick, but due to the fact that Kubrick (2001: A Space Odyssey)  really did a great motion picture. Eyes Wide Shut is a movie that explores the psychological roots of the human feelings, concerning a very delicate subject, which is the treason. The eroticism present in the movie is not gratuitous. There is a purpose to be there and the purpose is to make us think about many things that surround our lives: from the prostitute contaminated with AIDS to the man who uses his own daughter to gain money, the movie constantly gives us something to think about. And there is a lot of time to think since the movie is very long, sometimes tedious. But nothing that we can not tolerate. Moreover, Kubrick presents a natural vision from one of the biggest myths of the human kind: the sex. In Eyes Wide Shut the sexuality is treated with extremely naturalness.It seems that Kubrick's last piece of art have great chances to receive some nominations for the next Academy Awards and succeed in some categories: Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman acted extremely well, so were the supporting performances, the art direction and costume design are superb, the soundtrack is excellent, collecting some great musics that fit perfectly in the screen, following the story according to the movie plot; not to mention, of course, the direction.

A rake of a movie that will leave you with plenty to think about...,"Eyes Wide Shut  keeps you on your heels and demands your attention throughout the length (2 hours and 45 minutes) of the film.  The plot follows a simple concept: marriage and fidelity.Tom Cruise and his real-life wife play a successful married couple that at first appearance has everything they could possibly desire.  However, under the surface the viewer finds it apparent that this couple is struggling with a marriage that seems to have lost its appeal.  Kidman demonstrates, in startling detail, that she is not perfect wife her husband envisions. With no more than words and insinuation she makes evident that adultery does not require the carnal act of sex, but it is legitimately possible to be unfaithful in mind alone.  Kidman's all-to-honest confession sends Dr. Billy (Cruise) for ride that begins with simple introspection and leads him to the veritable edge.  Our hero, Cruise, becomes involved in an elaborate game of vindication through adultery and deception, and sends our hero to the brink and back.Eyes Wide Shut is visually stunning and it's obvious that Kubrick poured his soul into his final film.  He is a master of leading the viewer through an intricate look into our collective humanity.  You find yourself feeling the pain and paranoia of his characters, and you will question if what you are watching is real or if its is imagined.  Crammed with irony, the story is as abstract as it is simple.  In all, you will enjoy the movie long after you leave the theater.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Nothing much happened but witer/ director Stanley Kubrick still had something to say about it,"(1999) Eyes Wide Shut
PSYCHOLOGICAL DRAMAProduced, co-written and directed by Stanley Kubrick has extravagant doctor, William Harford (Tom Cruise) and his wife, Alice Hartford (Nicole Kidman) being invited to an expensive party by an old friend, Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack). And while William was watching the band playing, he would then notice the guy playing the piano, and recognize his peer, Nick Nightingale (Todd Field) when he was in medical school. For it was obvious William's old friend dropped out so that he can continue to play piano. And by the time both William and his wife got home, it was not long before both start arguing. Since during the party, William caught his wife dancing with someone he does not know and that his wife saw him walking arm and arm with two young ladies. Nothing became of both of those instances, but as a result of William being reminded about a particular time, she finally confessed she almost left him and their child. And as William was walking home after a family friend had passed away, he was then tempted to enter into a secret society when his old friend, Nick was invited to play for them. To which the last time he played a gig for them he had to be blindfolded, except that when they put it on for him, he was able to see fully naked women with the only thing covering them was their faces.Although, nothing much happened toward the end, it still taps Kubrick into another questionable world in terms of secret societies, infidelity and temptation.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Summary,"Stanley Kubrick is regarded as one of the greatest directors of his time and even past. Making only a few films in his career, which spanned four decades, ended with the mystery drama thriller ""Eyes Wide Shut."" The films length spans a little over two and a half hours, and within it is the modern day classic Kubrick masterpiece. The look of it is very ""Kubrick"" because of how it was shot. Not simply just the lighting, but also the film stock as well. As a special request to Eastman- Kodak films, the company remade and released the film stock that had been out of print that had that look Kubrick desired. Lit mostly with practical's, such as Christmas string lights and assorted lamps around the room  Aided only by the occasional china lantern or highly diffused light. The story itself revolves around Dr. Bill Harford (played by Tom Cruise) and his encounter with a cult of sex fiends. Even though the movie possibly could have easily been told in less amount of time, it is very unlike Stanley Kubrick to not show every detail both prior and post the main event of the film. To get a greater sense of whom Dr. Bill Harford and his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) we spend the greater portion of an hour and a half learning about what kind of people they are. What sort of fantasies, and lives they live on the outside of their marriage. Not to take any of this lightly, it was not uncommon for Kubrick to spend much more time than any other director would have on a scene  making sure he captured every little last detail, and that he got what he came there to get. Such a scene takes place between Bill and a friend of his Victor Ziegler (played by Sydney Pollack). Taken in one location, that of Victor's billiards room took roughly a month to film. Any other director would have been told to move on by studio heads because it was a waste of budget. Sadly however only a few days after the movie was shown to the studios Kubrick passed away.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the 10 best movies of the decade.,"Being a huge fan of Kubrick, I was expecting this movie to be a great one and, I really wasn't disappointed at all. This movie is a very complicated and weird one with strange twists and a great psychological evolution for each one of the two main characters. Tom Cruise is pretty good and Nicole Kidman is great in her role but, what is important to remember is that, this movie is a Stanley Kubrick movie and therefore, is not accessible for everyone. If you are expecting your average movie where all the answers are given or if you don't want to think about what is going on, don't see this movie. But, if you're in the market for an interesting psychological drama with great cinematography and a good script, then, see this movie. That is all I've got to say....",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Um...hmm...Ok...,"I'll tell you what. For everything that takes place in Eyes Wide Shut, to me it just boils down to one man dealing with the thought of his wife being with someone else. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) is married to Alice (Nicole Kidman). One night Alice tells Bill that she once had a fantasy about giving everything in her life up, for one night with a man she saw the previous summer. This somewhat upsetting news leads him to one of the strangest nights of his, or anyone else's for that matter, life I've ever seen.It starts with a visit to an old friend, goes to a prostitute, follows into a bar, goes to a costume shop, and ends up at one of the weirdest orgies I've ever seen. Then again, I've never been to one so who am I to say it's wierd. There is a lot of nudity, and a lot of talking in this movie. It's very slow moving. The characters seem to have to draw everything out by repeating things over and over. If someone asks a question, the answer has to include that same question. A few times I wanted to yell, ""Just spit it out already!"". The story was just plain odd. Bill, after finding out about his wife's fantasy, ends up walking around New York. Everywhere he goes he is tempted by a beautiful woman. Whether it's a prostitute, a friend, a man pimping his daughter, or a woman in a mask, someone always seems to want him. And the question is, will he give in to his temptation and, in his mind, get back at his wife? Or will he not allow himself to cross that line?The performances were pretty good overall. Tom Cruise again shows why he is so successful as an actor, and not just another pretty face. He gives more of a subtle, laid back performance this time. His facial expressions and emotions don't go very far, but that's the sort of tone the entire movie has. Nicole Kidman, who wasn't in the movie nearly as much as I thought she would be, also gives a fine performance. I saw her character as being very sexual, someone every man would want, which is why Tom Cruise's character deals with so much after hearing about her fantasy. Sydney Pollack is the only other person in the film who showed up for more than a few scenes. Everyone else had their part and then left. Leelee Sobieski was the only other person I really recognized, and she had a very small, yet revealing part.Being that this is Stanley Kubrick's last film, I suppose I should say something about the filmmaking. I've only seen two other Kubrick films in their entirety, and those were 2001 and A Clockwork Orange. I've also seen parts of The Shining, and the one thing they've all had in common, is that they are very deliberate. Kubrick takes a lot of time to get the audience to see everything that goes on around the characters. Every shot, every sentence is milked as much as it can. While it tends to make the films longer than most other directors would make it, it also makes it very full. I'm not sure how else to say it. You never feel like something is missing from a scene. From the set design to the music, every scene is full of life. Especially in this film. From the apartment sets to the orgy, the look of the movie was very distinct. And the music, especially that haunting piano, kept me on the edge of my seat.Overall, Eyes Wide Shut is definitely not for everyone. To many it will seem extremely boring, and the ending not very spectacular. To others it will be considered a masterpiece. To me, it fell somewhere in the middle. Not the greatest film ever made, not even the best Kubrick film ever made, but something that will definitely go down in history.

NICOLE KIDMAN'S PERFORMANCE WAS SOMETHING ELSE!!,"Stanley Kubrick's final film once again does bring the contribution to the art of cinema. It's a film about the sexual fears and desires that inhabit every relationship and as such there is not meant to be any real explanations. I'd say it's Kubrick's finest of his whole film career. I get that it's disturbing when it comes to the masked ball and Nicole Kidman's hysterical performance in the film. I was not a fan of the score and it does feel a bit tense at times.

Mesmerizing and Quirky,"This is a film I've anticipated not only because it was directed by one of the great directors of the 20th century, but also because it so called brought to the light topics in which some if not most would only call it speculation.In this film, Bill Harford (Tom Cruise), a well mannered and respected doctor, goes on a thrilling adventure into the night after his wife, Alice (Nicple Kidman) confesses to him that she has sexual fantasies for another man. This sticks with Bill throughout the film, as he keeps on imagining his wife with the other man.Bill and Alice's relationship seems on the edge of unity and yet total collapse. It stuck with me for some reason thinking to myself if I were in this sort of marriage where honesty differs for at least one of the two parties.During Bill's night out, he goes through endless encounters with the more bizarre side of the city. Hookers, under aged human trafficking and secret society parties are all included. What struck me most was that you can't always tell if what Bill is going through is in his mind or if it's really happening. It raises the question of what I were to do if being present in these situations.Kubrick's way of direction when aiming for tension in scenes was spot on. You don't always need bombastic music or loud voices to send shivers down your spine, and trust me when I write this, you get shivers down your spine watching this. Sometimes subtle glances are all you need.I really enjoyed this film. Its weirdness, realism and judgementalism of hierarchy in societies even today. It isn't the movie you would watch to pass the time. It will raise questions. I loved how honest and true the film was to its ideas without abiding to the rules of modern society.

Hope this isn't how Kubrick is remembered,"Eyes Wide Shut portrays, in a distinct, memorable, Kubrick-esque kind of way, the moral dilemmas that attractive partners in a cozy marriage face. It also managed to leave me high and dry.The movie itself is intriguing. Images of a ritualistic swingers club and a build-up to a murder-mystery plot are paced a bit slowly, but on par with plot development in other Kubrick movies. Dr. Bill Harford's (Tom Cruise) wild jealousy over his wife's confession of her fantasy about another man provides the fuel for the events that unfold in a quirky and disturbing way.Nicole Kidman, who plays Bill's wife Alice, manages to suck the life out of many scenes with over-the-top acting, but still scrapes up an excellent performance in the ""confession"" scene. Also, the pattern of dialogue--the actors repeated the lines of the other actors frequently--became extremely obtrusive. But the gravestone of this movie was the ending.Eyes Wide Shut is worth a look for solid film-making and editing. Don't expect to find closure; have a back-up movie handy. I would consider this movie a ""mirror"" of The Sixth Sense in that Eyes Wide Shut has a horrible ending where The Sixth Sense has an excellent ending (that the whole plot depends on).",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

When the form of delivery does not repel, only then it's possible to acquire the ideas and messages the movie serves. It's Kubrick, it's discrepant... The movie is explicit, sometimes it's vulgar and repulsive, but every snippet of a dialog contains food for thought, non trivial, even controversial, but ideas, that from time to time will come to your mind and the movie will echo back even after a very long time.The plot is concentrated on a 9 year married couple which lives happy and peaceful life. But a confession, slight and insignificant at first sight, made by the wife (Kidman), turns upside down the lives of the both. A confession, that she cheated on him just by thought, makes the husband (Cruise) to open his eyes and see that he did not really know neither his wife, nor himself, and this revelation leads him to a chain of unusual and dangerous affairs.But the plot is not the only strong side of the movie. Flawless acting of Kidman and Cruise, supported by Kubrick's unique style and accompanied by brilliant music complete the picture.Even if you are not fond of Kubrick, or drama movies in general, 'Eyes Wide Shut' is a must see, just to be aware of another type of movies, or maybe the only representative of that type.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Thought-provoking and visually stunning erotic thriller.,"Stanley Kubrick's last film, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a thought-provoking and visually stunning erotic thriller.  Kubrick will undoubtedly be nominated for Best Director at next year's Oscars (which overlooked him for winning that prize his entire career).Kubrick's trademark camera moves, colors, and sets are all here-- they reminded me a lot of ""The Shining"".Ultimately this film is about fidelity in marriage-- not sexual perversion, or anything like that.  I didn't expect this kind of theme, but it works well and proves more ""adult"" than any kind of blatant eroticism would be.Nicole Kidman gives the best performance in the film, despite the slow-talking that, contrary to another user comment, actually starts in the scene where she is drunk and dancing with the older man.My criticisms of the film are that, at 2:45, it is way too long.  It slows down considerably and could have used about 30 minutes edited out.  The slow speech of all the characters, near the end, becomes.... really.... annoying. So does the soundtrack, which, though effective in some scenes.... gets on your nerves.Overall, a nice effort, and worth seeing-- 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Mystic, intriguing, and beautiful","Tom Cruise's performance in this movie is absolutely flawless. He delivers a captivating portrayal that keeps us engaged throughout the film. Additionally, Stanley Kubrick's directing is highly impressive, skillfully transforming even seemingly uninteresting scenes into enjoyable moments to watch.The masquerade scene in particular stands out as one of the best scenes in cinematic history. Its execution is masterful, leaving a lasting impact.The use of symbolism adds depth and complexity to the narrative, allowing for multiple layers of interpretation and enhancing the overall viewing experience.Shostakochich's music selection perfectly complements the scenes, effectively capturing the emotions and intensifying the impact of key moments. The music becomes an integral part of the storytelling, evoking feelings of tension, intrigue, and sensuality.However, it must be noted that the film does suffer from some pacing issues. At times, the story feels stretched, with several scenes appearing out of context and detracting from the overall narrative.

Vale Stanley,"Was Kubrick a maker of popular Hollywood films who masqueraded as an art film auteur, or a giant of the cinema who liked to break even on a picture? This one certainly indicates he liked to do things his way, but it is an entertaining film nevertheless, despite the length (160 minutes) and the stately pace.I think Kubrick's widow Christine got it right when she said ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is about fear. In this case it is the fear that one is missing out on something forbidden but delicious, or perhaps the fear that one has failed to achieve true fulfillment despite all the conventional trappings of success. Dr Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) has it all - society practice, luxurious Manhattan apartment, Range Rover, beautiful attentive art curator wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) and cute small daughter. Bill is motivated to find what he's missed by Alice's confession that she had been prepared to give him and everything else up for a handsome naval officer she merely saw across a crowded room at a resort months ago. Fueled by mental images of Alice cavorting with the officer, Bill goes out to find whatever it was he's missed. The journey is an interesting one with Kubrick doing his usual stringing together of set pieces/cameos to reach a rather maudlin but vaguely cheerful conclusion. The unjustly notorious orgy scene is absurd rather than erotic but some of the scenes between Bill and Alice are as intimate as one gets in cinema.Kubrick was like Hitchcock in using detail to telling effect, though unlike Kubrick, Hitchcock knew when to stop. Tom Cruise breaks down and cries at one stage, probably because Stanley had asked him to do the scene for the 101st time. The detail is truly extraordinary. Just one example. In the opening scene, Alice is naked in front of a mirror above her dressing table and Bill, also naked, moves to caress her. On the dressing table are a few books. On the top is Alan Bullock's biography of Hitler and Stalin. A conventional enough tome to find as a young NYC doctor's bedside reading. The next book down is a biography of (the still living) Lord Longford. Lord Longford? He was the eccentric peer who launched a futile campaign against pornography in Britain in the early 1960s including among his targets Kubrick's film of Lolita. This reference is in the only mildly erotic scene in the whole film. A Lolita-like character makes a brief appearance later on and the angle offered will not amuse the politically correct, or Lord Longford, if he is still watching.Detail is used for dramatic effect, not realism. Thus Bill gets on the Interstate to get to the country estate where the orgy is being held and winds up in England. Stanley plays fast and loose with the locations. The exterior is Mentmore in Buckinghamshire, built by the Rothschilds, some of the interior is Highclere in Hampshire, another fantastic Victorian pile, and the orgy scene is set in a Moorish style room in Elveden, the Guinness family mansion in Suffolk.The plot doesn't bear close examination but the script is workmanlike and the minor performances enjoyable. You can see why actors liked to work with Kubrick despite his reputation for inordinate pains - he always gave the bit players a scene to steal (with Peter Sellars in ""Dr Strangelove"" being a multiple offender).As for the leads, Tom Cruise (""it's OK, I'm a doctor""), although playing the character we see the film through, doesn't quite project a personality the audience can relate to - somehow it's hard to empathise with him and his obsession. Nicole Kidman is fine - yes of course she can act. She is particularly good early on, at a posh party, fending off while sloshed an oily would-be lover. Sydney Pollack as Victor, their wealthy and sleazy friend, is a standout also.Well, that's Kubrick. His older films stand up amazingly well (eg ""Paths of Glory"", ""Dr Strangelove""). He was one of the few eccentric individualists of the cinema who actually did their best work on their own. With this film, he went out on a strong note, and I'm sure I'll enjoy a second viewing almost as much as the first.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Kubrick's final masterwork: a haunting, compelling nightmare","Due to the advertising and rumors surrounding the plot (not to mention the stunt-casting of real-life husband and wife Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as the central married couple) most people expected this film, Stanley Kubrick's last picture, to be an explicit story of sex and adultery. I expected it too, to be honest. I couldn't have been more wrong: Eyes Wide Shut is one of the coldest, most unsettling studies of love and betrayal ever made, one that acquires new meanings as the years go by.Set in New York (but actually shot in London), the film's bizarre chain of events starts at a party, a typical Kubrickian context, where Dr. Bill Harford (Cruise) and his spouse Alice (Kidman) are among the guests. While his wife elegantly tells a suitor to get lost, Bill is asked to help the host (played with eerie charm by Sydney Pollack) revive a naked girl who has accidentally OD:d in a bathroom. Though visibly shocked by these events, the physician returns home and calmly follows his usual routine. One night, however, an argument between him and Alice leads to the latter revealing she fantasized about sleeping with another man during a holiday. Stunned by the cruelly honest confession, Bill leaves the house and spends the rest of the night wandering around, the image of his wife having an affair prompting him to seek revenge: at first he considers having sex with a prostitute, then he decides to attend a party a friend told him about, only to run into something bigger than imagined and almost risk his life.Superficially, Eyes Wide Shut can be considered a sex film, but it is in fact much deeper: with only one actual ""sex"" scene (apart from the infamous orgy sequence and Bill's visions) in the whole movie, the focus is more on what love and commitment imply and demand. Naturally, being this a Kubrick film, no happiness should be expected: so chilling it actually makes Mike Nichols' Closer look like a comedy, EWS leaves no room for comfort or relief, the cynical closing line being the definitive punch in the stomach for anyone hoping things would go differently.Moreover, the wonderfully strange title suggests this movie might be the one that most reflects the director's view on cinema: film is like a dream. In this case, it is a frightening nightmare, and even though there are clues that seem to prove Bill's harrowing experience took place in his mind alone the ghostly atmosphere never leaves.Scariest of all, though, are the fearless anti-performances Cruise and Kidman deliver: combining the original script with whatever problems they might have had at the time (one should keep in mind their divorce was finalized less than two years after the movie's release), they expose the darkest sides of marriage with a brutal sincerity that clearly indicates there is no, or very little, acting involved. And while Cruise used his role and that of Frank Mackey in Magnolia (his best work to date) to prove he could handle more difficult characters, Kidman's surprisingly raw portrayal of disappointment and secret lust was the first of many parts (Moulin Rouge!, The Hours and Dogville in particular) that showed the world she was actually a great actress and not just the Top Gun star's wife.With its layered thematic content, expert execution and brave cast, Eyes Wide Shut is a fascinating last film from one of cinema's undisputed masters, and like all other Kubrick pictures it repays repeated viewings like few are able to. A little warning, nevertheless: it is not recommended if you get nightmares easily.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It's a complex film that not all will appreciate, but the more open you are to - whatever - the more apt you are to enjoy this tale of love, sex, jealousy and fear. Things do not always move at a snappy pace and a few scenes could have been cut in half, but if you love the art of film and admire Kubrick in any way, you've got to appreciate what he was trying to do even if the outcome is not to your liking. The music and some scenes - the masked figures nodding(to name just one)- will stick with me for a long time. I never thought one note on a piano key could make me sit up so straight.

Kubrick's use of imagery and music to torture while informing his viewer had me on the edge of my seat for the entire movie.

Kubrick's Best ?,Eyes wide shut stands the test of time becoming very culturally relevant to this day. All of the news recently starting with Jeffery Epstein all the was to now with news about the dark side of Hollywood and the rich and powerful. The rumored of masked parties with nefarious acts including people from politicians to actors to billionaires sound more and more believable. This film from 1999 seems to reveal what the recent conspiracies and rumors say it would look like possibly alluding to a truth about them. This film brings a lot of horror within itself and possibly in our real world bringing more and more questions.I think Eyes wide shut is Kubrick's best work and has so much going on. This is overall one of the creepiest/coolest film I have every seen. This film is about Bill Hartford played by Tom Cruise who goes to a party and sees something he should not have.His wife having thoughts about another man leads Bill to go on a long walk late at night in New York City. While on his walk he runs into an old friend who leads and sneaks him into a private masked party of rich people. This turns out to be a cult sex party and his curiosity lead him into trouble and now he has to get out in order to save his life. The scenes are long and drawn out raises the tension of every moment. The costume's make for a dark creepy aura that surrounds each of the people.

"has its moments, but overall a disappointment","I have had the pleasure of seeing every single Kubrick film on the big screen. While some were better than others, each one surprised with its unconventional storytelling, and usually with innovative visuals that stay with the viewer long after leaving the theater. Most Kubrick films are adapted from novels, but Kubrick felt quite free to vastly alter the original story for his own purposes. Films like Lolita and A Clockwork Orange use intriguing imagery to give physicality to books which have more to do with the workings of the protagonist's mind than his interaction with his surroundings.How strange, then, that Kubrick would adapt Traumnovelle, a story that takes place almost completely inside the protagonist's head, and that the adaptation would be so literal...setting aside, of course, the fact that Eyes Wide Shut takes place a century later than the novel. Bill Hareford (Tom Cruise) is clearly growing more and more obsessed about both his wife's sexual fantasies and a world full of sexual practices foreign -and inexplicable- to him. And yet, excepting black and white hallucinations of his wife with another man, his obsession, his confusion, is mostly implied, his specific thoughts and theories mostly left for us to be guessed at. And that's irritating, not just because we as an audience want to understand the character we're watching, but also because Kubrick has such a reputation for inventive dialog and imagery that simultaneously entertains and advances the story, while also giving us insight into what the characters are thinking. Of course, very often, as in 2001 or Lolita or Full Metal Jacket, not much context is required to understand the thoughts and motivations of any given character: they are driven by lust, survival, fear. But its harder to tell what Bill Hareford is driven by. Why does he go to the costume party? In the novel, it's a way of dealing with his growing irritation that perhaps he isn't as suave and cosmopolitan as he thought. In the movie, it's less clear. In the hands of a master storyteller like Kubrick, ambiguity can be quite appropriate, but in this film there is too much of it, or it's in the wrong places, or something. All I can say now, less than twenty-four hours after viewing the film, that the placement of ambiguity often felt intuitively wrong to me.The scenery is colorful and well-lit, the costumes are chic, the acting is good, and there are plenty of attractive naked women to look at, but with one notable exception - the already-famous costume party ordeal in the middle of the film - there is little here that is going to stick in my mind for very long. And...how...slow...Nicole...Kidman...talked....I...realize...it...was...on.. .purpose...but...it...got...old.What was so great about these scenes that they had to be filmed over so many times? And the hubub about the sexiness of the film is really misplaced...there have been much bolder, sexier, more shocking movies, many of them with an R rating. I would have liked to see the unedited NC-17 cut, but I fear genitalia and graphic sex would regrettably not make the story any more interesting.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Even the sex scenes were tepid at best.  There was nothing sexy about them.  The anonymous sex between party goers was a step below XXX films only because you really saw nothing.

A masterpiece of cinematic history!,"Eyes Wide Shut came out in the Summer of 1999 and was directed by my favourite director of all time, Stanley Kubrick, who sadly died a week after the film's final cut was shown. The film follows Bill and Alice Harford who seem like a typical New York wealthy and happy family with their 7 year old daughter but when Alice reveals a secret about a sexual encounter with a man from last summer, Bill then goes to get fair on his wife by also sleeping with someone and after everything fails, Bill then is recommended by his friend to go to a building outside NYC only to discover the great danger he's in and how it can affect his family and friends. Eyes Wide Shut deserves more attention because it truly is a masterpiece in cinematic history, why? The film is art, it's so beautiful, can we all just look at that amazing ritual scene in the film, that scene was basically a painting, literally, A PAINTING!! The performances are so loveable but I haft to say, Kidman goes way over Cruise, I really wished she was in the film more which was probably just my little glitch with it but I truly did not mind that, she was just better than Tom Cruise, no affence! There arent really any other characters except for a few who pop in and out like the costume shop man and his daughter and people like that.

does not live up to Kubric's standard,"In his old age, the late great Stanley Kubric may well have gone off the deep end, much like a character in one of his last films, ""The Shining"", as this pointless and underdeveloped urban epic demonstrates. Does as banal a subject as martial fidelity problems require such a grandiose, overstuffed and overacted treatment ? Is a sequence where an 18th century venetian carnival is coupled with an orgiastic cult ritual have any relation to modern borgeuois America? Would prominent citizens or anyone for that matter actually want to engage in the kind of debauchery witnessed by Cruise ? Does a movie which opens with Nicole Kidman's bare behind and closes with her utterance of the f-word have reasonable merit? Odd characters who drop in and out of the plot, a ludicrous pseudo-suspense of the piano score, an extremely slow buildup which ends abruptly at about a third of its logical progression, are some of the picture's more baffling aspects. Indeed, the question that arises as the credits begin to roll is not ""what happened?"", but ""why?"" Why was Kubric compelled to make this ? Was it the voyeristic prospect of working with Nicole and scores of other nude women? Hopefully not just that. Regardless of his motives, the end result by no means makes the impression of a total waste, possessing the kind of lush camerawork we'd come to expect over the years, as well as a consistent level of interest that renders ""Eyes Wide Shut"", like all of the auteur's creative output, worthy of discussion and repeat viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The setting is lurid: high-contrast using bright reds and blues. Kubrick creates intense scenes through drawn out dialogue but also adds hilarious comedic relief. The result is dream-like cinema which could have been perfected. R.I.P.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Flawed but fascinating,"This is a film which divides its audience into those who are fascinated by it and those who are bored stiff.There's a lot that's good about it.  Tom Cruise turns in his usual capable performance, Nicole Kidman her usual brilliant one.  The sets are magnificent, reminding one of the huge rooms of The Shining or the emptiness of outer space in 2001.  The plot is thought-provoking, with its suggestions of the decadence and corruption of the rich and powerful.  The storyline, though long drawn out, is fairly easy to follow and has some sort of resolution at the end.There are even some light touches - Stanley Kubrick must have know it would be his last film, as there are visual or aural references to most of his previous films, and even a pile of Stanley Kubrick videos in a bedroom scene near the end!And any film with 3 different shots of Nicole Kidman's bare bottom will get me buying the DVD!But there are also flaws.  It is definitely too long, and would have benefited from losing 20 minutes at least.  There are illogical plot developments - e.g. just how did everyone at the orgy know so fast that Bill was there under false pretences? - and how did Mandy recognise him under his mask?  Also we learn virtually nothing about Alice and Bill's background other than that she used to own a gallery.  And much as I like Nicole Kidman's bottom, I have to acknowledge that its appearances in this film do seem totally gratuitous!A good film, but it doesn't come anywhere near Kubrick's best.  And, by the way, the Region 2 DVD is uncensored, unlike the Region 1 release.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Pretentious, poorly written & acted.","This is a mind numbing experience; how they could stretch such slight material to such a length is astonishing. Were it any other director, the studio would have done the public a service by getting the scissors out. The film confirms that Cruise is ""dimensionally challenged"" when it comes to acting, striking one or two standard poses previously seen in prior outings. Avoid at all costs.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Unfairly maligned,"This film, while not one of Stanley Kubrick's masterpieces, is a very compelling work nonetheless and deserves better than the negative  buzz it's gotten from typical filmgoers, who expect movies with a standard linear plot and a theme (if there is one) wrapped up in a tight little bow.  It is a somewhat profound, always interesting study of the inherent sexual desires present beneath the surface in all of us and is made more effective by the remarkable one-key score.  However, unlike Kubrick's finer pictures, such as ""A Clockwork Orange"", this movie contains little subtext beneath it's main theme and it's effectiveness is hindered by it's need to give the story a definitive, happy ending when an ambiguous one consistent with the film's nightmarish feel would have been more appropriate.  If you want a truly awe-inspiring work, Kubrick left behind a whole challenging body to admire; if you just want ""Kubrick-lite"", this one is worth checking out.  But be warned-you will still be expected to use your brain.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Stunning, beautiful, quirky.",This is one of the most beautiful films ever photographed. Primary colors explode and glow in every scene. Dr. Bill (Cruise) can't seem to figure out how to deal with his wife's almost-infidelity and goes on a bender of almost-sex. I just saw this film 9 hours ago (11AM 7/16/99) and am not sure if I love this film or merely find it interesting. This happens often with Kubrick films. With one or two notable exceptions (Lolita and Barry Lyndon) I always grow to love them though. I expect to end up loving this film. One of the most memorable lines to ever end a movie.,7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Kubrick's swan song is about human desires and sex- I'm obsessed,"""Eyes Wide Shut"" is Kubrick's last film and the conclusion to my summer Kubrick Marathon. During those days, that the honour to watch these weird and effective stories come alive from maybe the most influensial director of all time and one of my favorites for sure. Eyes Wide Shut is a weird experience and it differs from any other Kubric film. It is a film which can be seen from many angles and in order to be fully understood and appreciated, it has to be viewed multiple times.In the film, Kubrick grows deep into our very own human desires for sex, truth, connection, consumerism and creates a ""universe"" where everything is shiny and we get to take a look to how consumerism and money have changed the world and everyone has become more or less a being that gives full attention to what people think about them and how they look. As I see it, the couple of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman can be seen a mirror to the society that Kubric wants to portray during the whole film. The husband eagerly consumes without giving a second thought, tries to meet new women and engage with them, he cannot stop trying to achieve his sexual goals and money and generally his whole economical and social state is a ticket for completing his desires. Notice that his first line in the film has to do with his wallet or that he does not hesitate to give money even if he does not need do. His consuming nature and desire for more and more are viewed by his long walks from place to place and his whole obsession with that orgy mask party. He goes to gritty extremes and I love those scenes which purely reveal his obsessive nature. Cruise is a blast and let's not forget that 1999 was a blast for him, because he was exceptional is Magnolia too.The wife is more of a self-lover, a narcissist. She hold the title ""of a beautiful lady"" and we can see that see always car about her looks and likes it when people call her pretty with flattering words. One of the shots that reveal her nature Is the shot where the couple kisses in front of the mirror naked and the wife looks at her self while she is passionately kissed by her husband. She is also haunted by her dreams of another handsome man having sex with her and the idea of cheat poisons her souls but she actually cannot let it go. The dreams reveal her deep desires for another more free love, an affair out of all this and her inability to escape all this devastates her.And dreams do play a really important role in this film. I think that in the end this film has an uncertainness to it. A lot of objects and scenes give you the impression that they might be a complete lie, something fake. We are not sure if the crazy and alienating elements are a matter of imagination or a symbolism or even real. Therefore, the film has a dream-like atmosphere.Kubrick's direction and the style definitely boost this fantasy element. Most of the scenes use colorful lightbulbs hanged in every room and street to provoke that tone (anyways, it is set during Christmas). The slow move of the camera during the walks of Tom Cruise in the night, the blues and reds, the clever choices of switching between steady and shaky cam, the dream sequences...The technical aspects are great, like every other Kubrick film, though some sequences, especially during the 2nd half feel kind of weirdly shot and this is probably because Kubric's sad loss during the shooting. Leon Vitali, Stanley's loyal sidekick handled the shootings till the end and finished the film, but I think that some sequences felt more of Hitchcock or PTA than actual Kubric. That made the film kind of messy and less captivatingAnd this is m main bug too. It is not that I hated anything in the film, it is a really interesting film and you can make a lot out of it, but I felt kind of bored and uninterested during some parts , like it lacked a true consistency and core.Overall, the film is pretty good. Its cinematography, camera and soundtrack are perfect. Great performances. The script is a different thing compared to Kubrick's previous films and I liked that Stanley wanted to talk about humans and the society by using a single couple with a weird relationship. It is about desires, deceit, love, lies and truth, identity and it hinges on the consumeristic and ""oriented-by the-looks"" society that we are living in. As a fact, I feel that it is a film that I prefer thinking than watching, at least for now. But anyways...every Kubrick film demands multiple watches.I also want to add that I felt that the story might be a huge reference to Adam and Eve? A man and a woman naked succumbing into cheating and sinnery??? Well that's a bingo. And I appreciate that Kubrick movies are so open to theories and analysisKubrick is and will always be one of the most creative and genius filmmakers of all time. His films are crazy and unique and mad and funny and colorful and cool and meaningful and true and ""Eyes Wide Shut is no exception.And I love himAnd you know, there is something important that you need to do as soon as possible...What's that?Watch this film (or rewatch it )",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A fitting finale to a classic career,"The final film of director, Stanley Kubrick, has finally been released to theaters. It is a fine finale to a career of classic filmmaking. Although Kubrick has been accused of creating films that were cold and hard with characters to match, ""Eyes Wide Shut"", adapted from a novel by Arthur Schnitzler, introduces us to his two major characters as they are preparing for a gala Christmas party given by their friend. Dr. Bill Hartford (Tom Cruise) and Alice Hartford (Nicole Kidman) live a privileged existence in the posh circles of  Manhattan. Their lush apartment is filled with all the accouterments of such a life. As they dress for the party, their demeanor and oral responses to one another subtly reveal the relationship they have in their nine-year-old marriage. At the party itself we meet their host (Sidney Pollack). Here the couple each get involved in a flirtation, she with a Hungarian Lothario, and he with two lovely young models. This is just the beginning of their descent into the world of sexual obsession and fantasy.Kubrick uses his camera as the voyeuristic eye of the audience, never really being clear as to whether certain scenes are real or fantasy. Bunuel did this in his classic French film, ""Belle DuJour"".  Except for a series of expository scenes relating the everyday routines of the husband at work and his wife at home, the rest of the film is sort of a fever dream drifting along deeper and deeper into the vortex of sex and violence that is a combination of their own obsessions and outside events beyond their control.The rumors that have followed the three-year gestation of this movie are generally untrue. Although the film is about sex, curiously, it is not particularly erotic. The famous orgy, which occurs about two-thirds through the film (2 hours 40 minutes long), is slightly muted by the digital insertion of figures that obscure certain body parts and motions deemed unacceptable to the ratings board. Professional critics were shown both versions, but generally agreed that the effect was the same in both versions. Critic Roger Ebert suggested that both versions be exhibited in different theaters. The un-cut version will be shown in Europe. Hopefully, the American audience will see the original cut in its video incarnation next year.Kubrick once said when asked what the ending of the classic, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", meant, that he wanted the audience to bring something of themselves to his films. Therefore, he would not reveal any concrete answer. He said that the reason for the Mona Lisa's smile is part of her mystery. She would lose some of her appeal if DaVinci said that she was smiling because she is thinking of her lover. One error he makes in this film is toward the end he has the Sidney Pollack character give some sort of objective explanation of what has occurred. One could assume he was trying to give in to those who complained about the ambiguity of some of his other films. Hitchcock made a similar mistake in the psychiatrist's explanation of Norman Bates' condition at the end of ""Psycho"". Even this compromise does not materially flaw an otherwise distinct vision.Cruise and Kidman both give performances of which they can be proud. Kubrick's perfectionism is there on the screen. Kidman, in particular has a moving monologue in which she emotionally reveals to her husband, a fantasy she had years ago, which precipitates the rest of action in the film. Unfortunately, her character disappears for much of the remaining film, relegating her role to one basically supporting in nature.The film was completely filmed in England on sets, except for a couple of establishing shots of New York and several long shots of taxis on the streets of Manhattan. New Yorkers will recognize these street scenes as unreal. However, possibly, Kubrick wanted these sets to have a certain surreal ambiance. The musical score also adds effectively to sweep the audience along in what is a series of long scenes of extended dialogue. One hopes that adult audiences will appreciate Kubrick's vision, and it will encourage viewers to discuss their views and reactions to the last of a series of a unique creative works.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

asthetically pleasing,"Eyes Wide Shut is first and foremost a beautifully shot picture.  Great care is taken to make every shot pleasing to the eye.  The slow following of Tom Cruise throughout the movie (rather than keeping the camera stationary) is a wonderful technique that submerses the viewer into his character.  The colors are fantastic.  The angles extraordinarily complex and dramatically moving.  As for what the movie's about?  I don't know, for sure.  I think I know, but I don't think anyone knows for sure what this movie means.  I don't think even Stanley Kubrick knew when he made it.  But regardless, like most of Kubrick's work, this film will persevere through our time, and I imagine one day it will be raised to the height that it deserves, a beautifully complex film for all time.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Tedious Swan-Song from a Legendary Director,"This is in many ways an interesting look at jealousy and infidelity that is seriously marred by two elements: (1) excruciatingly slow pacing, and (2) building the movie around the famed centerpiece orgy scene, which may have seemed daring when Kubrick first started working on this screenplay in 1975, but today looks like a pretentious and very expensive scene from a soft-core cable flick. On the plus side, Kidman shines in what are essentially 3 dramatic monologues that occupy most of her time on screen. There's much to enjoy visually in terms of the use of color and light, and the haunting piano theme used during the orgy is an instant classic. Kubrick also manages to build some suspense, but by the time the mysteries were explained, my reaction was, ""That's it? That's what I waited 2 and a half hours to hear?""",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I finished Kubrick's whole filmography !,"I FINALLY completed the filmography of the LEGENDARY Stanley Kubrick.Eyes wide shut was his final film before he tragically passed away in 1999 he worked on this film with Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman both famous people , the movie has a lot of nudity and that's what the overall goal of the movie is to talk about that specific subject which is not very new for Mr. Stanley Kubrick.The movie has some very very weird scenes but those very very weird scenes were done at a precise angles and selected environments and also very fixed lighting all done by the talented Kubrick he really is a perfectionist and only want the most perfect frames ever and they really pay off because of how well those frames has been framed and those lights were fixed the way and the only way Mr. Stanley Kubrick wanted them.The soundtrack of the movie is nice the acting is very good especially Nicole Kidman because her character faced a lot of stuff with Tom cruise's character and both really had a hard time going through the movie's plot and the relationship between them tightens and loosens.What's good is the dialogue in this film is very good and that's definitely a good thing by Mr Kubrick is that the dialogue is very good very well thought of and definitely very well produced by the actors in a way that Mr Kubrick wanted them.Overall the movie handled quite a few themes here that were quite weird and interesting in a way and I found that the movie was quite good and Obviously it was good because it's directed by the legend who made the masterpiece ""The Shining"" directed it and I am pleased to say that I have finally finished Mr. Stanley Kubrick's filmography from his first till his last and he is one of the BEST directors of all time and this movie is his last and I absolutely respect and love Mr Kubrick for ever and I give this movie a huge thumbs up and a score of an 8/10,Applauss for Kubrick.👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A Magnificent, Captivating Failure.","I have to declare myself as a Kubrick disciple since I saw 2001 when I was 12. I actually burst out into tears in public when I heard he'd died. So I can say that I was almost too scared to see this movie in case it disappointed. As a piece of work it is utterly beguiling. From the opening frames he once again transports you into a world all of his own and which you seem to yearn to return to once released from it. That is what he did like no other filmmaker ever.But is it a good film? I think that Stanley actually trod on a bit of a mine with this. Having made the definitive films dealing with many other genres, he had obviously brooded for 20 years on bringing that same dispassionate, yet disturbingly vibrant eye to sex. And I get the conclusion from this film that he is ultimately disallusioned with cornering his prey. Where war, space and psychopathy render huge revalations and insights by his 'freeze' treatment, I get the impression that the conclusion he comes to in the end, is that the subject matter is found wanting of drama. In short, that sex is ultimately boring.I personally found this conclusion actually quite ironically humourous and therefore it didn't really ruin the film for me, but then I am a Kubrick nut!",,Anonymous,Mystery
Kubrick does what he meant to do in this film.,"What drew me into this film, so much, is the story and the thriller-aspect of the whole thing. The dialogue and acting was bad, the film itself was a little long, but what I think Kubrick was trying to tap into was his version of an old Italian, erotic thriller from the 1970s and those interpretive-abstract, one or two, person plays in old bars that they used to do back in the late 60s/early 70s.Shot in Kubrick's standard 4:3 aspect ratio (a Kubrick staple), it looks fine and has that grainy film-stock look that I always liked about his films. I wound up staying with it all the way to the end and I didn't feel robbed at all. Nicole was very good and I found myself enjoying her American accent. Pollack was very good too. There is a nicely done scene at a party, with the patronage wearing masks, that helped with the creepy edge that Kubrick was trying to establish. And, by the way, people do not act like that when they are stoned. Way too over-the-top acting on that scene.7.8 (B- MyGrade) = 8 IMDB",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Thought-Provoking,"Although the movie has imperfections, it certainly is thought-provoking.One theme is the sexual exploitation of women by the wealthy and powerful. Another is trust and infidelity within a marriage.The danger of drug abuse is shown in an early scene, as a young prostitute nearly dies. The danger of working as a prostitute (and the danger of having sex with a prostitute) is revealed, as the roommate tells the doctor that the hooker he hired the night before, but did not have sex with, has just discovered out she's HIV positive.Something that was unrealistic and inconsistent with an earlier scene was the costume shop owner happily using his underage daughter as a prostitute. This should have been edited out. Another weakness is a too-long conversation between the doctor and his wife, and the overly long and repetitive conversation between the wife and the man she was dancing with.There are still some important unanswered questions at the end (I will not post a spoiler and say what they are), but the mystery is presented in an intelligent way, unlike in some other movies, and so doesn't annoy the viewer, but instead makes one think.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Remember this is a man who dealt with the existence of the whole human ran in ""2001""!  All in all, not the disaster critics are saying it is, but no masterpiece either.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Too bad Kubrick had to end his career with a false note . . .,"I've always considered Stanley Kubrick as one of the biggest geniuses ever to have worked in Hollywood. A man who has made movies like ""Full Metal Jacket"", ""The Shining"", ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and so many more excellent movies, doesn't deserve any less than to be seen as one of the greatest ever. But I really wonder what he had in mind when making this one. This was his last, but in my opinion also his least...The movie tells the story of a doctor who becomes obsessed with having a sexual encounter after his wife has admitted that she has had sexual fantasies about a man she once met. She hates the fact that he doesn't admit that he has had similar fantasies in the past and keeps torturing him with the idea. This leads him into unfulfilled encounters with a dead patient's daughter and a hooker, but when he pays a visit to a nightclub where he meets an old friend, he learns about a special secret society where sexual rituals are performed. Intrigued by the unknown, he decides to attend one of their congregations, but almost immediately finds himself in a lot of trouble. Not only is his own life in danger, so are his marriage and the lives of his wife and daughter...Before you think that I didn't like this movie because of all the nudity or the sexual content, I want you to know that such things don't bother me at all, certainly not when they add to the story and are brought in a very nice way (like in this movie for instance). No, what really bothered me about this movie was it's incredibly slow pace. I'm used to watch alternative and 'foreign' (read European, South American and Asian movies), but this certainly was one of the slowest that I've ever seen. Some will say that it helps to see the 'dream-like' state the characters are in... Possible, but it certainly didn't work for me. I got bored after a while and almost thought about hitting the fast forward button (something that I've never had before with other movies).I'm not saying that I wanted to see several action scenes in this movie either. Those who know me or those who have read several of my reviews on this website will know that I'm far from a fan of action-filled movies. I hate big explosions, a couple million rounds fired at an innocent bystander,... I really don't like that and don't need it to enjoy a movie. What I want is a very powerful story, some excellent acting and some nice camera-work. That, I did get from this movie at regular moments.Kubrick certainly knew how to create a certain atmosphere, thanks to the clever use of music and original camera work. And the fact that he chose Kidman and Cruise as his two main actors wasn't a bad choice either. But it is never enough to save the entire movie and the main reason why it got a lot of its publicity is probably because the director died before the project was closed and because Kidman and Cruise decided to end their marriage shortly after the movie was released... As I already said, Kubrick was one of Hollywood's greatest, but this was one of his weaker movies. I give it a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Was confusing at first but liked it.,"I just seen this recently on HBO. Never heard of it, never heard of the author. Just read the synopsis on dish. Started watching it and instantly I felt by the way the movie moved that it was done very well.Slow paced, not much verbal explanation,Very similar to well done movies that rely on camera and actor skills in portraying feelings and emotions without much dialogue.Was confused at first,but later understood the common meaning here. More akin to something you may learn or hear from a psychologist or group therapy, Its all about the human need for sex.Of course there is some level of complex social problems that is involved,(but really this is how it is in the real world)But basically it boils down to one thing the rich and powerful and people with status desire the most similar to any level status of humans...and that is sex.The film tries to show some conflict of the Doctor and his personal beliefs of social rights and wrongs but in the end his problems with his wife get down to what is core to their problem....Stress reducing, crazy all out, hormome realeasing, sex that all humans need to have.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The perverts will revolt but the intellectuals will rejoice!,"Kubrick has been making films since the 50's.  He has made two in my lifetime: Full Metal Jacket (1987) and Eyes Wide Shut (1999).  I was only seven when Full Metal Jacket came out and far too young, so it was a huge thrill for me to sit in that dark theatre and watch Kubrick's name appear on the screen.There was far less sex in the movie than I had predicted.  Instead, Kubrick stuck to his reputation of psychological exploration.  Bill Harford, played by Tom Cruise, is the focus of this exploration.  The catalyst is a bold confession by his wife, Alice Harford, about her brief obsession with a sailor.  This launches Cruise into a self-destructive path as he approaches his marriage with unbridled nihilism.Many events follow, the most bizarre being Bill's confrontation with masked nymphomaniacs.  This is really the final sexual event and so brings what I believe to be the conclusion about sex itself.  It does not portray animal sex as funny or beautiful, but instead casts it in the light of a Masonic or Satanic type of ritual.While watching the movie, I could not help but think of Edgar Allen Poe's villain in The Tell-Tale Heart.  Bill Harford is not confused or sex-crazed and he is certainly not stupid.  Bill is an intellectual and approaches all of his situations with that type of arrogance that an intellectual has. Yet, when he sees that mask on his pillow, that's the defining moment, the thundering beat of a heart under the floorboards.  It is then when a previously confident intellectual crumbles under the realization of his own weakness and sexual obsession.  All that time, Bill Harford had walked through his own life with eyes wide shut.I loved this movie.  And that's all I can say.  Those who were waiting for some shocking sexual act in the movie will be severely disappointed.  I don't know if this is his best, but if you are a fan of Kubrick films, you will not be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not a big surprise...,"When I sat down in the movie theatre to watch this film I had a momentary vision. I roughly knew what the plot of this film  was going to be. I knew the ending too. And I could guess the last line as well before Nicole's character says it. And now I feel like this film didn't do anything that hadn't been seen earlier. The only thing that kept me really in suspense was to see if Stanley in his old days was going to break down in front of the commercial power of the starring duo and simply be happy to make a film without ambition.I hope that is the case since this film didn't live up to my expectations. I just didn't like the story. On the other hand one can defend the film by saying that everyone sees it differently and that many of Kubricks films draw their greatest strength from individual scenes and sometimes from individual images and that only time will tell if this is a good film.Kubrick has shown a lot of versatility in his career but somehow I have the feeling that acting has always been the weakest link of his films and although not a total failure Cruise and Kidman only manage to annoy me. I suppose the theme is sexuality and the Cruise character is in a way caught in the middle of this spectrum of sexuality and everything that goes with it. Sounds interesting but basically falls short of a good script. I didn't enjoy the music that much either. But even so the film is definately not bad, it is probably one of this years best films on the big screen.",,Anonymous,Mystery
I AM THE NEXT KUBRICK,actually thats a lie.there will never be another kubrick. i can only hope one day no one gets what i try to do and yet they keep paying me to do it. kubrick was like such fine wine getting better with every year. the reason people hated this movie is because they resent kubrick for what he did in 2001. he made them listen to nietzshe whether they wanted to or not. no one like to pay for a kick in the balls and thus the world of unintellectual christian camels hated fight club. they run around waving flags of their virtue and then they go home molest their children and rage about how directors are ruining the youth of america. while all of yall are really understanding the sexual aspect of the movie there is also a much larger aspect to this movie. that aspect is the celit-pagan sex ritual that they perform in the mansion. now paganism is directly related to freemasonry. if u noticed everyone at the mansion was a very wealthy man. so it was millionaires having animal annonymous sex with hookers and other various miscarriages.then when an outsider enters he is to be murdered. he is spared but why is this all so top secret. in order to get into the movie i think you would have to look into what freemasonry is all about and how it dictates the front pages of headlines everyday. i think kubrick was telling that story the most discrete way he could. in true showman fashion he dies immediately after this film or maybe even during it.we love u stanley where ever you are,7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
beautifully creepy.,"I cannot possibly sum up Eyes Wide Shut better than the quote from Time Magazine on the movie's commercial:""Kubrick's haunting final masterpiece.""Those four words say more than any other words possibly could.""Kubrick's"" - Eyes Wide Shut is absolutely a Stanley Kubrick movie.  Every detail is beautiful, from the ear-piercing, rhythmic piano that gets your heart racing, to the beautiful visuals and colors that shift the mood of the story around only the way Kubrick can manage.""haunting"" - The movie is creepy at best.  While it may begin almost like a cheap porno, there is a story building.  The casual nudity and numerous references to sex is what makes Eyes Wide Shut live.  The story is based on these elements rather than being encompassed by them.  The real story lies within the title.  The idea presented is that of reality vs dreams. Sometimes you can't tell which one is which, often leaving us with our ""eyes wide shut.""  This idea is what gives the movie its ""haunting"" feeling. When looking at a real situation and thinking it is almost dream like is as creepy as looking at a dream and believing it is real.""final"" - This is the most unfortunate of the four words.  Stanley Kubrick has blessed us with many great films, Eyes Wide Shut being his last.""masterpiece"" - Absolutely.  This is the only word in any language that can successfully describe Eyes Wide Shut.  Everyone gets something out of this movie.  However, there is no true way to describe it... it must be seen to truly understand.So now after all of this, you may be wondering why I only gave it a 9/10 and not a 10?  Simple.  There is no such thing as a 10.  A 10 is a movie that holds the key to life itself or something equally important.So there you have it.  My review of Eyes Wide Shut.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Deeply troubled and unable to shake off this new found thorn in the relationship he finds himself in a twist of fate that sends him into a downward spiral where he ends up with more than he bargained for. Perhaps Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" showcases the legendary director's trademarks. The symbolism, the distinguished acting, flawless cinematography and the steady, gradual pacing that leads to the climax. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are well cast as the troubled and attractive couple who go through the challenges of marriage as their world is shaken to its core by matters beyond their control. But the most compelling and haunting factor of the film is the mystery that lies behind the circumstances of the events and what may have transpired. Secret societies, the Illuminati, sinister and deviant rituals, the elite and the other conspiracy theories that have made this film one of the most discussed and dissected works in cinema history. While somewhat slow-going made more by one too many unnecessary scenes, this final bow by Kubrick is a testament to the power of cinema to entertain and to make one think on the reality of the world one lives in while searching for the truth to find meaning and purpose in our lives.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Just another (lame) movie,"Any plot that, for example, repeatedly depends upon the phone ringing, (wouldn't you know it, just in the nick of time) doesn't cut it for me, especially if it's been hyped as art-cinema history. The plot, the script, the characters, the acting, even the rather annoying piano-pounded score: all weak.

One of those films that improves on repeated viewings,"My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****.Back in 1999, Eyes Wide Shut was one of the most anticipated films of the year, only the Phantom Menace was more anticipated. Being Stanley Kubrick's final film and starring then married couple Tom Cruise & Nicole Kidman, there was good reason for it to be so anticipated. Critical reception was positive but underwhelming, critics mostly admired the film but few called it a masterpiece. Audience response was mixed to negative, Eyes Wide Shut was a modest box office success based solely on it's two stars.The opinion of some of Kubrick's films have changed drastically over the years. 2001 and The Shining received mixed to negative responses when they first debuted, now both are viewed as seminal masterpieces in their genre. It'll be interesting how Eyes Wide Shut is viewed in another ten years, I'm not so sure how it's overall legacy has changed much in the twelve years since it debuted.My opinion of Eyes Wide Shut on the first viewing was that it was an interesting failure. It had some memorable scenes and images but I just didn't see the point in the film. For the most part, it seemed like Kubrick was going through the motions and it was an underwhelming way to end a brilliant career.To say my opinion has changed is an understatement. While I would not call Eyes Wide Shut a masterpiece, I will say it is a very worthy addition to Stanley Kubrick's oeuvre and a fitting conclusion to his career. When I watch it now I see a film with some very memorable scenes and rich images, but also a fascinating look at jealousy and sexual temptation. What wasn't apparent to me on the first viewing has become so on repeated ones. The gratuitous sex doesn't seem pointless anymore, it's there for a reason. Give Kubrick credit for making sex seem so unappealing and mechanical, he's making a statement about the human condition. Sex isn't about love in EWS, very little of the sex is an act of love here, it's about filling urges and temptations.EWS has the same striking visual style as previous Kubrick films. The film has a dream-like atmosphere, which has lead some people to believe that much of what is transpiring on the screen is a dream through Tom Cruise's character. The most memorable scene is the sexual orgy, it's very Gothic with the black cloaks and the masks worn by the characters. This scene ranks up there with the most memorable imagery in Kubrick's films. Another memorable scene is Tom Cruise's character being stalked through the streets of New York.On the first viewing, I was not crazy about Tom Cruise's performance, I would've described it as ""wooden."" While I don't view it as great work and there are few instances where the performance falls flat, I think it is a generally solid performance. Nicole Kidman, though she has lesser screen time, is consistently excellent, taking attention away from Cruise every time they're on screen together.EWS is a complex film that's difficult to describe and hard to take in on a single viewing. This film needs to be watched more than once to be appreciated. Perhaps it's not for everyone, which describes most of Kubrick's films, but for the adventurous film watcher, EWS is a worthy film.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Tight direction and a sense of growing unease give the extremly slow opening two acts a lot of promise for Kubrick's last feature but it ulimtately fizzles out,Tight direction and a sense of growing unease give the extremly slow opening two acts a lot of promise for Kubrick's last feature but it ulimtately fizzles out as the tension is wasted on an underwhemling conclusion and the pacing spends too little time exploring the central premise of the sex-cult which is the main draw and interest at the heart of the film. Cruise is charming yet restrained and is perfectly cast as the lead but less can be said of Nicole Kidman who stumbles her way through some truly dire lines which serve to prove again that Kubrick could never write for female characters. Overall it is one of his weakest pictures but one I found myself enjoying immensely for some portions of the second act if only it could have maintained this.,7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Don't blame Kubrick,"Performers' importance varies from movie to movie.  Normally, I see them as window dressing--especially with actresses.  But with this particular movie, the actors are vital.  A major fault with the movie is Tom and Nicole's inability to be a convincing couple.  With EWS, Bill's not-so-wild escapades are supposed to be motivated by the infliction of jealousy by his wife and various sequences of events, but the relationship between Tom and Nicole made it impossibly silly to imagine how Alice could put Bill in such a state.  Flashing back to black and white soft core between Nicole and some naval officer isn't enough.  After all, there are tons of infidelities going around in today's society, and you don't see men crashing orgies for it, let alone crashing one just because of the idea of infidelity.It wasn't the script's fault, though.  Kidman's lines emphasize her willingness to throw away a 9 year relationship for a fling as well as her inability to see her husband as a masculine and sexual being.  I believe that was suposed to be a significant point of revelation for Bill.  But there was nothing in Nicole's delivery of her lines to make me believe how dire and dreadful a point she was making, nor was there any good acting on Tom's part to make me believe that suddenly his whole concept of what kind of relationship he had (not to mention his concept of what a married couple is) suddenly shattered.  But if you listen to the lines carefully, you can see it's there.  Not just the lines, but the sequence of events that lead Cruise's character through his strange odyssey.  (Like the ridicule of Tom's sexuality by those boys who tell him to go back to San Francisco where he belongs.)This was undoubtedly a terrific piece, and I'm not saying this to praise one of my favortie directors. Visually, it's gorgeous--very flawless.  There's a good sense of balance, too (except towards the end, maybe).  However, because of Tom and Nicole, I don't believe many people will realize how good it actually is.  Without knowing Bill's motivations the movie is pointless because like most Kubrick pieces the film isn't so much plot driven but character/psychology/action driven.  Try to ignore their performances and just listen to the words as written by Kubrick and pay attention to little details.  It'll make more sense that way.It really is no wonder why Kubrick took so long with this film and had to call and recall Cruise and Kidman for so many reshoots.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Not one of Kubrick's best,"The much hyped ""Eyes Wide Shut"" didn't really meet my expectations as a big fan of Stanley Kubrick's works. While I am more enamored of his less artistic works to begin with, such as ""Dr. Strangelove"" or ""A Clockwork Orange"", this movie didn't even meet the levels of ""2001"".One of the best parts of most of Kubrick's work is that he keeps you enraptured throughout his films, never taking your eyes off the screen. Not so here. The first 45 minutes seem to stretch on endlessly. Nicole Kidman, especially, is simply playing a bad character. She isn't so much the wife on the protagonist, Tom Cruise's Dr. Bill Hartford, as much as she's another aspect of the libido we explore throughout the film. This is symbolized ad nauseam, mainly in the fact that Kidman takes about 30 seconds between every word she speaks, so as to give the impression of a far off angel, I suppose.There are some good spots, when Cruise's character hits the street. Vinessa Shaw, a lady of the street, and Todd Field, an old friend who shows him another world of sorts, are very good. There are some moments that make you sit up and say ""Wow"", the kind of thing only Stanley Kubrick can do. The problem here is that Kubrick tries to inject too many of those moments into his film, instead of letting them come naturally, and it doesn't have the same effect.All in all, this isn't a bad movie, but not as good as you might expect given some of the names working on out. There is layer upon layer of symbolism and insight, and sometimes it crashes upon itself, and you're left wondering what exactly Kubrick was aiming for with certain scenes. The movie is worth seeing, but don't go in with your expectations too high, especially if you're familiar with some of Kubrick's earlier works.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Somehow you can sense that Nicole Kidman, a very beautiful woman, has been coached into the role of - a very beautiful woman.  But it's not the same beautiful woman.  What a clever trick!  The New York streets, (put together in Pinewood), are so New York that you expect Gene Kelly to splash about in their puddles.  Then there is the set that is a large number of the most perfect naked female bodies.  Phew!  That must have been CGI. It would upset the natural balance of the world if all that flawless flesh gathered in one room.  Omitting to do the faces was just a tease.  Oh, yeah.And Tom Cruise was OK.  So.  Masterpiece?

The best film of the year!,"As of December 5, 1999 Eyes Wide Shut is definitley the best film of the year.  Only three other films released this year have been close to it, Bringing out the Dead, The Insider, and American Beauty.One thing that makes me angry is when people say this film is about sex. This film is definitley not about sex.  Anyone who says that either didn't see the film, or didn't understand it.  The film may deal with sexual issues, but it is not about sex.  It is about jealousy, and sexual obsession.  It is about betrayal and trust.Directed by Stanley Kubrick, one of the greatest film makers ever, and starring Nicole Kidman (who should win an oscar for her portrayal) and Tom Cruise (who deserves the very least a  nomination).  Stanley Kubrick puts us on the streets of New York after hours.  We follow Cruise's character (Bill) on the streets as he is tempted and lured into a sexual world, but will Bill do it, or does he have enough faith?  This is not Kubrick's best film, but one of his finest, and definitley one of the top 10 films of the 90's.  I feel it may get cheated during Oscar time, but the movie will always stay high in my heart.God bless Stanley Kubrick.  He was truly a magnificent man.  I never met the man in my whole life, but in my short 16 year old life so far he is the closest person to me who has ever died.  And I have to say, I had a tear in my eye when I heard he past away.

This film is about trust in a long term relationship.  As one newspaper reviewer put it, EWS is about that dangerous question between two people: What are you thinking?  This film attempts to answer that question.I've lived through some of the conversations in this film - and I know of others who have to.  EWS, while not a favorite film for me, certainly gave me food for thought.  If you don't want to know the answer to the questions then don't see this film.

Highly Conservative,"For a film that was advertised as the new 9 1/2 weeks, this is a very chilly film. The basic premise is that sex outside the sanctity of marriage will either kill or haunt you forever. There are some things to hate about this movie (that damned awful piano score) but also things to admire about it. If you feel this is Kubrick's worst movie, try sitting through Barry Lyndon. If Stanley was still alive I'd like to ask him what was up with Alan Cumming's character, was it supposed to be funny or just disturbing? I thought he was going to leap over the desk and kiss Cruise.Overall, this film was a little suspenseful and NOT SEXY AT ALL. And the ending of the story with Kidman's promise to Cruise almost came off more like a threat. Or a life sentence. Whatever grandpa Stanley says, sex is not THAT scary.

Eyes Wide Shut,"About twenty minutes into Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut, I find a familiar question on my mind. It's a question I've pondered often, a question I find myself asking nearly every time I see Tom Cruise on film: namely, why is this guy in this movie? I'm not one of those people who hates Tom Cruise, I just think he's a pretty bad actor bless his heart. And he's laboriously clenching his face and waving his hands, and his wife Nicole Kidman is doing some equally ingratiating non-imitation of human behavior, and grand master Kubrick is standing behind the camera taking it all in in steady, sustained shots--what's going on here? Tom and Nicole are performing, but they're not acting.Thus, Eyes Wide Shut sort of fails as an exploration of characters, but it finds an odd success as something else entirely: a study of icons. It is no accident, of course, that Kubrick's sex odyssey stars a then-high profile then-married Hollywood couple: ""Cruise Kidman Kubrick"" is the film's only tag line. And while I was never invested in Tom's Dr. Bill, I was fascinated to see Cruise himself deal with the pressure of society's hypocritical sexual demands. After all, we hold our icons to a strict standard of monogamy while simultaneously conditioning their continued celebrity on a preposterous hypersexuality; it's our ever- present threat of sexual judgment and ridicule that pushes Cruise's character into a freaky sex cult, and pushes Cruise into celebrity marriages and couch-hopping lunacy. I can't guess to what extent Cruise and Kidman are in on the film's central conceit, but it seems clear to me that Kubrick's aspirations lie outside of traditional character-based narrative cinema.Eyes Wide Shut is no Strangelove or Clockwork or 2001, but it is an interesting deconstruction of celebrity. If Tom Cruise is strange, confused and detached, we're complicit in the societal sexual hypocrisy that makes him that way. -TK 9/14/10",,Anonymous,Mystery
A good film that feels incomplete,"A Manhattan doctor embarks on a bizarre, night-long odyssey after his wife's admission of unfulfilled longing.Eyes Wide Shut is Stanley Kubrick's incomplete swan song. Its story, as with all Kubrick films, is filled with mystery and ambiguity, while also madness. However, to no fault of the film, it does feel incomplete. It feels like there is an entire storyline or a major scene that is missing in the film, most likely cut and burned forever, given that it is rumored that this film is based on cults in Hollywood and the elite. With this stated, I was captivated by the story of jealousy, cults, and infidelity. Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, and Sydney Pollack were all fantastic in this film and perfectly presented the depth of their characters and their relationships.

Absolutely terrifying and wonderful.,"Stanley Kubrick has left us with a beautiful uncompromising final film. It is disturbingly beautiful, leaves no answers, and leaves your mouth gaping open from the the jaw dropping first glimpse to the credits.

The performance by Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are their best ever, the visuals are amazing, the story was sublime, but unfortunately, it is not destined for mainstream acceptance.  As I was leaving the theater, I could hear one one woman say, ""Two years wait for this, we should have seen Notting Hill."", Her husband replied, ""The best part was the credits.""

Most Underrated Film of Kubrick?,"Kubrick left leaving everything what he had acquired here. 400 days of Eyes Wide Shut made it a masterpiece of Kubrick which we should rank aside with 2001, shining etc. A hypnotic and dreamy narration adds crisp long shots and dedicated music with brilliant acting are more than enough to immerse into this classic.Sexually explicit scenes might be the reason which made people conclude this is an erotic film which exactly isn't. While erotica barely an essence of the plot, there is more intricate paradox of commitment the film deals with. Conflict starts from an argument of Bill and Alice revealing their misconceptions on marriage making an epiphany both to us and the leads. Then begins the dreamy travel through the city which ends up in a more eerie atmosphere of a ritual orgy. Eventually leads us to a realisation how much layered its plot is. The very climax scenes unfolds before us, both dream and truth are mutually upside-down.Along with the master cinematography, Jocelyn Pook's hand-picked music scores adds to the complexity and the mystery. A noteworthy Tamil song with a Carnatic music intensify the extremity of strangeness of the orgy scene. Also, happy hear that in a film like this. I do notice how gorgeous Tom Cruise as well as Kidman as the film demands the necessity of their beauty.Eyes Wide Shut easily becomes my second favorite Kubrick film after The Shining.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Bizarre Odyssey About the Double Lives People Live,"If you are like me, you will watch this movie for the fact that it is a Stanley Kubrick film and the fact you heard about the weird orgy cult (which the movie does have). But there is so much more to the movie than just these things. It is a story of a journey into the insanity of nighttime and the bizarre lives others live without us even knowing. Then, it is about trying to get out of the rabbit hole after experiencing this.
This movie is built around atmosphere and is really not supposed to be realistic, but rather the isolation that covers the frame or the excess is supposed to give a feel for this strange world that the characters inhabit. The films high amount of sex is used more as a metaphor for the other parts of ourselves that we do not want the rest of the world to know about.

"Hard to judge this film, but what the heck...","I've heard people say ""If 'Eyes Wide Shut' was done by anyone else, people would be disappointed."" In my case, that is why I'm disappointed. Because Kubrick was unable to maintain his extreme brilliance in what ended up being his final film. It was not a bad movie. Despite popular opinion, Tom Cruise's performance was fine in my eyes. Also, Nicole's limited opportunities didn't exactly scream ""Oscar!"" (but what has in 1999?) The story was interesting to a point, but after 159 minutes, I had almost lost interest and noticed that many of the people in the theater had as well. Slightly over 2 hours would've been much better for the film's pace. The thoughts that ran through my mind:-- Haven't I seen this before? A different plot but the same idea done in a better way by Martin Scorsese in ""After Hours."" True, ""AH"" might not be as profound, but that works to its advantage, anyway; EWS wasn't all that deep.-- Kidman pulled off the stoned act rather well. Either that, or everyone I've been in company with that was high acts the EXACT same way.-- After bragging to all my friends about how the almighty Kubrick had released another masterpiece, I realize I have a lot of phone calls to make once we get home.But it wasn't bad.

Which reminds me of a really good JAP joke, but... never mind.}Bias going in: Expecting, hoping, maybe even needing to worship at the feet of the Master.In no particular order:Casting:Bummer. Cruise is about a hundred years too young for the part. The book (and film it 'inspired'... a direct quote from the closing credits) calls for a man approaching young middle age, life-philosophy and habits set in the stone of an already closed mind. In other words, a jaded man as complacent as any white male at the pinnacle of a societally-valued career can be -- and who is about to have the core of his smug little being shaken to its roots. An Everyman, yes -- but a man, not a boy.Kidman: Eye-candy disguised as a window-dressing plot device. A pun on the title that's only too apt, I'm afraid. She has no career, no goals, no... I was about to say 'dreams and desires' but that would be only figuratively true. She has them 'literally' so Cruise can play off them, but in the sense they exist at all, they exist for him alone, as do all the other women in the film. What she does have, however, is a great butt. To-Die-For great. ==cough, cough=> Kidman/Cruise, as couple and chemistry: More interesting, because it was both good and bad. I can see the attraction for Kubrick; the ready-made comfort level that would allow him to make the first scene (her taking a casual pee while Cruise responds to her 'how do I look?' with 'great, as always') work. But. That same level of unstrived-for coupleness that comes after ten years of marriage is also... boring. I don't mean the sort of boring-for-the-sake-of-him-kicking-over-the-traces banality that would incite a viewer to wonder what lay beneath the calluses, but a real been-there, done-that quality that came through *despite* Kubrick's intentions.Given all the above, the cynic in me wonders (and will never know) if the only way to get Her marvelously sculpted butt was to hire His cute little manicured face.Script:Think of a primer on writing that warns against 'on-the-nose' dialogue by giving examples. This entire script could be used to fill it. Right down to the 50-point type, front page, carefully-placed-to-look-like-a-throwaway newspaper headline that screams the film's message: LUCKY TO BE ALIVE!  And entire speeches revealing motive and mindset have been lifted in their entirety from the book and plunked here---a mere seventy-three years and a galaxy far, far, away---later. There's more---lots more---but I'm depressed just thinking about it.Plot:-- Kidman almost has a late afternoon zipless f**k... but doesn't.-- Cruise almost has two early evening super-models super f**ks... but doesn't.-- Kidman almost goes off with an aging Hungarian lothario... but doesn't.-- Cruise almost sleeps with a hooker... but doesn't.-- Cruise learns that he almost slept with a hooker... with AIDS... and is glad he hadn't.-- Cruise almost kisses a dead woman... but doesn't.-- Cruise almost gives in to irrational sexual jealousy... but doesn't.-- Cruise almost gets laid at an orgy... but doesn't.-- Cruise almost gets in trouble at an orgy... but doesn't.-- Cruise almost has to strip at an orgy... but doesn't.-- Cruise almost has his comfy little apple cart of a life upset... and I sincerely wish it had been.Shall I go on, or have I laid bare the bones of a film that was overheard in the bathroom afterward as: ""Too slooow, and jeez, nothing ever happened.""Visuals: The orgy was just silly and overlong, as were most of the other scenes. The use of color: red for sexuality and blue for emotion (I think; they just blurred after a while) has been done before, and better in films like Jou Dou, Raise High the Red Lantern and especially TC,TT,HWAHL.Pace: Glacial, which would be forgiven if there were a pay-off. And even so, thirty minutes could easily be cut with no loss to anyone.Concept:Mind-blowing news just discovered by the original writer of the novella and the otherwise brilliant director of the movie: women *like* to f**k!--  Film at eleven.Sigh. This was by far the film's most egregious fault: it was made at least thirty years too late.Kubrick's widow said that he became obsessed with the book (which she wisely refused to read, feeling that all that 'psychological conversation' was boringly passe, and Schnitzler's failed attempt to overlay new-fangled Freudian theory on old-fashioned Burghers, lame) in 1968. Maybe... a big maybe... if Kubrick had made the film then, transforming fin de siecle Vienna into an insight on the so-called sexual revolution taking place in middle-class America, it might have worked. But now?Aside from the fact that there was nothing in that 'orgy' (ridiculous R, or NC-17 version) that isn't seen nightly on Spice channel *ads* -- the film destroyed the book's main conceit: That middle-class matrons so longed to be f**ked silly (an impossible 'dream' at a time and place where, according to Schnitzler, woman married just to lose their virginity in a societally approved way), and middle-class men so longed to be freed (if only for a few hours, and only anonymously) of their Madonna/Whore complex -- that a if-you-reveal-our-secret-you-die club flourished in the shadows. A club where otherwise sexually repressed men could live out their frightening Freudian fantasies and even more repressed women could give in to their penis envy by engulfing a few dozen at a time, and where getting caught could mean expulsion from decent society, loss of children, or worse. What a titillating idea... then.In Eyes Wide Shut however, aging, wealthy men pay to be serviced by young, beautiful hookers with great tits and no sags, blemishes, untrimmed bikini lines or cellulite. Wow -- is that a nouveau concept, or what? Oh, and despite the fact that it's the *man* who's supposedly being stripped bare (it's Cruise's movie all the way) there's no male nudity of course, blemished or otherwise -- except for two unclothed, sort of heaving, chests. Worse: by not tackling what is true of marriage today -- that in a society which encourages us to experiment in every possible way with our bodies, but never our hearts, minds and souls, keeping the sexual frisson alive while married to the same person for even ten years is damn difficult -- Kubrick missed his chance to bring his genius to bear on his vision.And so that which in 1926 might have been erotic, is today laughable. Cruise is jealous because of Kidman's unrealized *fantasy* (after ten years of faithful marriage, no less)? Hell, what long-married couple doesn't *use* those fantasies as the over-the-counter equivalent of Viagra? Along with visual aids and toys from the neighborhood sex shop. Hotel guest and Cabana boy (Mad About You), anyone? Master and Maid? Liddy and Bob play Doctor and the Drugstore? Well, you get the point.Tension:Over what -- that rich, powerful men in masks pay for group sex and might be discovered doing it? Booking a spot on Letterman and bragging about being a club member is more like it. Kidman feeling like Cruise is taking her for granted? Tune in to Oprah. Kidman's sobbing in *terror* and *shame* while recounting a dream in which she'd been willingly f**ked by countless men? Puh-lease. I swear, D.H. is standing in the wings, laughing himself silly and wondering when the remake of Lady Chatterly will be done, and which part Adam Sandler will play. In fact, the only real tension in nearly three hours was unintentional. At the very end, when Kidman and Cruise are patting each other's backs for being such lucky ducks and staying safely married despite the wicked temptations around them, all I could think about was their young daughter, who'd been left to wander alone in what looked like F.A.O. Schwartz for an interminable time -- long enough to be grabbed by some really dangerous modern character and spirited away -- and all I wanted to do was yell 'go find your child, you insufferable clods!'  A sign, I suppose, that I wasn't exactly moved by either of them, or their 'plight'.Your mileage may vary.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hidden in Plain Sight,"****SPOILERS****Stanley Kubrick's last film that he delivered the rough cut to Warner Brothers studios a week before he suddenly passed away at age 70 is filled with innuendos about secret societies that control or are controlled by those in power who really run things in the world at large. This strange world of power and control is discovered almost by accident by young doctor William Hartford, Tom Cruise, who after his wife Alice, Nicole Kidman, confessed to him in having an affair with a handsome US naval officer, who ends up doing a series of naval maneuvers on her, the year before while on vacation at Cape Cod. William who feels that he's been cheated on by his wife now wants to have a good time of his own by going out at night to the city's red light district and pick up hookers and get even with Alice for what she did to him.With the help of his friend pianist Nick Nightingale,Todd Field, William now looking for bigger kicks and thrills then a one night stand with a hooker that are places where the kicks or fun is both hot & heavy that are far more interesting as well as exciting if he's got the balls to go to and experience them. William soon gets himself invited to this costume party in the suburbs where he's told, by Nightingale, that everyone there lets it all hang out and does their thing without any interruption from the outside world. As things soon turn out it becomes apparent to the very naive William Hartford that he's way over his head with the people he's involved in and the things he sees, if reviled, may well end up having him and his family members murdered. In fact one of the masked women at the party who tried to get him to leave later ended up dead from a drug overdose.The film has William slowly realize that things aren't what he thinks that they are with those whom he associates and parties with like some of his friends on the outside world. It's William's good friend jet set billionaire party thrower Victor Ziegler, Sydney Pollack, who later fills in the gaps to the persons and events that William got involved with at the costume party. William earlier had saved Sydney's a** by getting a young woman who overdosed on drugs in Victor's pad emergency treatment in order to keep Victor's both name out of the papers as well as a** from ending up behind bars. It was Victor's intervention that in fact prevented the members of the secret society that William spied on from doing both him and his wife Alice in.****SPOILERS**** In the final moments of the movie it's William, who's been going through hell for what he saw and experienced, who ends up in a state of shock in him finding out that it was his wife Alice whom he tried to get revenge on, for cheating on him, who was behind this entire scam. Broken and defeated, in seeing that he's not in charge of his life, William now meekly goes along with his wife's wishes to forget about the past and just go on with their lives as if nothing happened. Interesting but uneven film about those who really control things in the world of finance and politics as well as our individual lives. With the sad fact that it's director Stanley Kubrick didn't live long enough to edit and release his director's cut, like he did in almost all of his movies, of the film that would have smoothed things out and explained its many rough and uneven edges.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A different take,"This film is about sex and human culture, perhaps sex AS human culture. It's saying that sex is a far deeper part of our society than we want to accept. Not sex for procreation, sex for the sake of sex. In a subtler way, it's about everyone's battle between sowing their seeds and maintaining a steady relationship. Of the two principal characters, the married couple Bill and Alice, it's every bit as much about Alice's battle as is it about Bill's. In fact, it is Bill who's stunned to find out that Alice even has such fantasies. It's important to note that although Alice and Bill are both highly sought after by the opposite sex the only people they make love to in the movie are each other. They may talk about others, they may even dabble, but in the end nothing is ever consummated with anyone else. Bill isn't saved from cheating by a miraculous set of circumstances. Bill doesn't cheat, because in his heart he doesn't want to cheat. He found excuses to get out of the situations he could have just as easily found excuses to stay in the situations.As in any most stories, the outer conflict was just a mirror image of the inner struggle. If just going to the orgy was ""way over [Bill's] head"" and puts his life in danger, just imagine what consummating the deal would have meant! His search for the details behind the orgy are analogous to his own soul search. Part of himself desperately wanted in and the other part was desperately trying to keep him out.I would like to clear up an often misrepresented situation, after Alice tells Bill about her crush on the Navy man Bill does not leave the house to find some action in revenge. In fact, he goes to see a recently deceased patient and his daughter. Soon the daughter reveals that she feels EXACTLY the same about him as Alice felt about the Navy man. He even tries to brush off the hooker he meets thereafter. Falling into situations, and extricating oneself, are a far cry from seeking out those situations.To my mind some of the most important scenes were those at the costume shop. The owner is furious when he finds his daughter with a few Asian gentlemen, but it's fine the next day. Apparently, he didn't care what his daughter was doing, he just wanted to make sure he was paid for it. The owner even offers his daughter to Bill. In fact, everyone in the entire movie except Alice and Bill seem to act his way. The owner's lack of concern for his daughter juxtaposes splendidly with the soul searching Bill has endured.Two other points of note: It's interesting that Bill and Alice have a daughter but she's in maybe 2 minutes of this 2 1/2 hour film. In fact, the babysitter's a more prominent character. It's a land where the act of sex is important, but the results of sex aren't. Lastly, Alice's reaction after hearing Bill's story and giving it a lot of thought is to want to go home and have sex. Even at the end, all their trials and tribulations just come down to sex, even as their daughter roams free in the aisles of the toys store.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Ultimate fantasy,"A mysterious, seductive, and slightly confusing erotic thriller that plants some pleasant ideas in your head of a global elite that consciously dualizes and controls our existence.The Christmas lights that shines brightly in each frame and the monotonous piano piece that beautifully follows the dramaturgy makes you form a feeling that Dr. Bill lives in a dream world. A world he first wakes up from when he stumbles across an occult orgy ritual. Then the slave fog lightens and he sees reality for what it is: ruled by a secret satanic elite that controls our existence.As usual with Kubrick, direction, scenography, photography, and music are extraordinary executed.

A tale of jealousy,"Eyes Wide Shut examines what happens to a couple when one little truth is revealed.  Nicole Kidman tells husband Tom Cruise that she would've dropped everything in her life for one night with a Naval officer.  This sends Cruise into a state of unbalanced jealousy.  He imagines his wife with the officer, doing things.  Those thoughts send him wandering the streets of New York.  He runs into a friend of his and learns of a secret club.  From there, things get stranger for Tom.  Kubrick's last film features his usual exquisite camera work.  The centerpiece of the film reminded me of a cross between, The Overlook from The Shining and HAL's disembodided voice whenever one of the masked guests spoke.  The main theme of the film is jealousy, and what it can do to one's emotional state.   A haunting vision that will take time to grow on us.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
My Favorite Movie of All Time!,"Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut is one of those that can be analyzed in every way shape and form. Even though the film wasn't a big success back when it was released (Exactly ten years ago today!!), the film has since grown and has found new fans with every viewing. I don't care what anyone says, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are perfectly cast as the wealthy secretive couple. I know a lot of people feel their pacing was very slow, but, when you think about it, Eyes Wide Shut is a very theatrical film. Basically, the film could be adapted to the stage with no problem. Cruise and Kidman took their time with each word to show the distinct emotion Bill or Alice would feel. Especially Kidman. Her lengthy monologues are beautifully seductive in the way she truthfully presents them to Bill and the audience. She is probably the most ambiguous character in the whole movie, often compared to the Hal 9000 from 2001. Both take their time to get their point across, which causes an uneasy feeling for the audience, and both have feminine attributes that control the other characters around them. Bill, on the other hand, is the type of character that you aren't sure if you want to like him or not. I know many people that understand him and feel him and yet I know others that feel he is too emotionally stiff. Both are correct. When Bill enters New York City around the witching hour, he witnesses a vain world that he would never see in the daylight. He tries to go with the flow and ends up being too voyeuristic and sticking his nose in places he shouldn't even dream of. Unlike Alice and her comparison to the Hal 9000, Bill is easily comparable to Barry Lyndon. Both Barry and Bill are too shallow for the upper society they try to take a part of. They aren't ready and both characters try to grow faster than they already are. Like The Shining, we don't root for Bill or Alice. In Fact, if any of the characters encountered a fatal attack, the audience wouldn't show sympathy. The characters in this film are sympathetic at all. I think this brings a new barrier to the way we look at character developments in other films. Kubrick took a risk and I believed it worked. Kubrick created yet another masterpiece and ended on the best note. I don't think there could have been another film that would have fit the end of the century like Kubrick's EWS. This was Kubrick's own personal favorite and I can see why! 10/10 ****/4",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An Interesting Theme,"I bought the film having seen clips of the pagan ritual on Youtube. If you are looking for some conspiracy stuff to sink your teeth into. This delivers. Some brilliant eerie parts that I am glad I paid for so I could watch them in my own time and without interruption.The film itself is better than average. But it does get confusing and somewhat cryptic towards the end. Also the scenes where Nicole Kidman's character is acting strangely/hysterically were dire and I skipped past them. Shorter, more controlled sections would have been better, for my own tastes only, of course.Of the three Kubrick films I have seen this one goes after The Shining, Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket. But it has high production values and if you can get your head around the end, an interesting story to boot!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Beautifully shot, impeccably acted, and consistently engrossing","Beautifully shot, impeccably acted, and consistently engrossing, Eyes Wide Shut is a fitting finale to the career of Stanley Kubrick. Taking us ""where the rainbow ends"", Eyes Wide Shut leads us through several days in the life of upper class New York Doctor Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) as he navigates through New York's sexual underground in a fit of jealousy. Based on Arthur Schnitzler's 1926 Traumnovelle (Dream Novella), it is a film without explanations and the viewer must decide what is real and what is fantasy. From the outset, it is clear that there is trouble in the Harford's nine-year old marriage, though it has not yet affected their eight-year old daughter Helena (Madison Eginton) who is eagerly looking forward to Christmas.The first hint that something is not right is when Bill tells his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) how great her hair looks without bothering to look at her. She does not say anything but her body language suggests that she is dissatisfied. The tension between them becomes crystallized during a party thrown by a wealthy acquaintance, Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack) in which she draws the attention of a charming Hungarian suitor and he is pursued by two attractive models. ""One of the charms of married life is that it makes deception a necessity for both parties,'' the suave Hungarian tells Alice.The events lead afterward to a discussion of marital fidelity. Upset over Bill's lack of jealousy, Alice, who has been smoking pot, recounts a fantasy she had about abandoning her family for a handsome naval officer she met at a resort hotel. Feeling that he has to prove his virility, Bill, in the vein of Scorcese's After Hours, undertakes a 48-hour odyssey through the dark side of New York looking for reassurance from a sexual partner. As in a recurring dream, at the moment before satisfaction is achieved - intruders, a cell phone, or a threat to his safety interrupts each experience. In his journey, he encounters the daughter of a deceased patient; a prostitute; the underage daughter of a costume salesman; a threatening group of homophobes, and a male hotel desk clerk who is turned on to him.The piece de resistance, however, is an extravagantly staged costumed orgy at a swank Long Island mansion. Lured by the piano player Nick Nightingale (Todd Field) who interests Dr. Harford with a story of mysterious gigs he plays blindfolded, he is led through a medieval-looking forest to a black Mass for the rich and powerful in which everyone is masked and costumed. When the doctor is exposed as an intruder, he is in real danger until a stately woman who has given him prior warnings to leave, saves him from at the very least taking his clothes off (from what else we can only guess).Although Cruise as D. Harford is the centerpiece of the film, he shows little emotion. He is either looking bewildered or acting uncomfortably sincere but he is always a passive onlooker. One expects that at some point he will confront himself and grasp the meaning of what is taking place, but there are no epiphanies or realizations. It is only when Alice, perhaps suspecting that she has gone too far in her story telling, asks Bill what they will do now, do they drop their masks and come to terms with the realities of their relationship.Eyes Wide Shut was Kubrick's final film and it is one of his best. Enhanced by an original score by Jocelyn Pook, darkly evocative piano music by Gyorgy Ligetti, and excerpts from Shostakovich, the film maintains its tension throughout and never lets us know where it is going. Although the mood suggests a decadent civilization careening out of control, Eyes Wide Shut ended up for me as a life-affirming experience. It challenges us not only to come to terms with our commitments in life but to better distinguish the difference between our thoughts and feelings and our true experience of ourselves and the people around us who give our life its meaning.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What a Shame!,"I recently got this film out on video, and was surprised (after hearing much negative talk about it) to find myself enjoying it. It had the usual weird and wonderful hallmarks of a Kubrick film.I enjoyed the minimalist style music, which accompanied the action, along with the more scene specific stuff (don't want to say more for fear of spoiling).In my view the film was about long term relationships: how jealousy can create insecurities; which can lead people to play dangerous games in order to redress the balance.Unfortunately, after a good start and a good build up of tension, this film simply stopped rather than ended. What a shame!The way in which the finishing scenes lacked some special ingredient makes me question whether Kubrick was still around in the final moments of the film's production.The film could have done with being several minutes longer, so that the points it made could have been delivered more slowly allowing the tension to be ease off less abruptly.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Better than I hoped...,"A really good film, enhancing Stanley Kubrick's reputation as a great director. I'm a big fan of Kubrick's work from 1971 onwards but wasn't expecting this film to be very good. Fortunately I was wrong.The Cruise/Kidman billing put me off right from the start, perhaps suggesting a rather lame, overly stylized level of production, and the film's length at over two-and-a-half hours also put me off, but for all that, it turned out to be an engrossing and entertaining film.If you're not into full frontal nudity and orgies you're not going to be impressed by this particular method of jolting your attention and setting the scene for the thriller/mystery aspect of the film, which doesn't quite pull it off in terms of tension. I was on the edge of my seat at one point, half-anticipating a Hitchcock thriller with a tense and justifiable ending, but unfortunately the film decided to play it safe, re-focusing on the lust/sexual/marriage aspects of the film instead of giving satisfaction.The story refocuses on Kubrick's message about potential deceit and who is betraying who, whether the couple are justified in feeling the way they do and how we ourselves would react under such tempting circumstances. Cruise's acting is good, but the transition his character made from being a faithful husband, with doubts about his wife's fidelity, into a man prepared to go to any lengths to satisfy his curiosity, wasn't quite believable.For all that, I really enjoyed the movie, continuing Kubrick's great run of form since A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, The Shining and Full Metal Jacket. Overall a worthy addition to the SK legacy.The ending was a little too convenient for me, but it did pose a very interesting question. Are we faithful to our partners because we love them, or because of obstacles that prevent us from being unfaithful?",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It lacks Kubrick's typical touch,"Eyes Wide Shut is not a bad movie. The story is engaging, the leading actors deliver good performances, the photography is exceptional...but it still lacks something. It lack's the final touch that makes a Stanley Kubrick picture a standalone thing. I mean....if you watch either A Clockwork Orange or 2001 A Space Odyssey (or Barry Lyndon, or any other early masterpiece Kubrick has delivered), at the end of the movie you're gonna be like:""Oh, my god! Was this movie for real or did I just dream it?"", your mouth wide open and tears of joy shedding from your eyes. After watching this one I felt instead like I've been watching a good movie, telling an intriguing story and directed with professionality. That's all. Nothing special. Nothing even in the same league of other Kubrick movies. It lacks Kubrick's magic.Bottom line: if this was directed by any other unknown guy it would be getting a 7.

I've seen a lot of hype about her over the years. Good to see a bit of substance behind it. Though...

Being in old Stanley's brain,"Arthur Schnitzler's Traumnovelle` was the model Kubrick based his film upon, and after all those almost perverse details that were heard before Eye Wide Shut` was released, it's amazing how slavishly it sticks to that model. For me, this means nothing good because I was as unsuccessful in finding out what Schnitzler wanted to say as I was with Kubrick. Schnitzler had at least a fine, readable language, which of course gets lost in an English language film.I saw the film shortly after it was released here, but I remembered it when I saw The Cell` recently. The two movies belong to dissimilar genres and try to meet completely different requirements, but the intensity of their pictures and how they prefer them to everything else, even the story. The director of The Cell` justified himself by a reference to the genre he comes from (videoclips), Stanley Kubrick, being dead, couldn't justify himself any more, and I can't imagine what he would have said, if he was still alive. After his masterpieces Full Metal Jacket`, The Shining` and several others, Eyes Wide Shut` seems like the late work of an unenthusiastic old artist, lacking ideas, full of emotionalism and overwhealming pictures, obsessed with sex, visually and in the dialogues. Also the characters (Tom Cruise giving one of his weak performances and Nicole Kidman who is not more than a supporting actress here) seem to think about nothing else. Being in old Stanley Kubrick's brain.How badly will he rate this movie, some of you might ask. And here is the surprise: Speaking purely emotionally, remembering the feeling I had during watching the film and immediately afterwards, I must admit that the film was a) not boring and b) absolutely fascinating, and two years later I can't, I just can't tell why. Obviously, there was still something, something not tangible left of Kubrick's genius. However, it's a pity that he's not among us. 6 points out of",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Defective screenplay brilliantly filmed,"It is unfortunate that Stanley Kubrick who has given us so many brilliant films (`Spartacus'; `2001, A Space Odyssey'; `A Clockwork Orange'; `The Shining'; `Full Metal Jacket'), should end his career with this one.  The biggest problem with this film is the screenplay, which is all the more perplexing since Kubrick helped write it.  It is hard to comprehend how such a masterful filmmaker could miss the mark by such a wide margin.Let me begin by saying that the technical aspects of this film were superb to the point of being superhuman.  Kubrick's camera work was pure genius. The color and lighting were impeccable; incomparable in their impact and effect as well as their beauty.  Anyone who has seen this film should go back and watch it again and just notice the way the sets are lighted, how the shadows are cast, how the rooms in the background are bathed in soft blue with contrasting colored lights perfectly splashed in to heighten the effect.  As far as the sound, Kubrick can do more with the well placed single note of a piano than most directors can do with an entire orchestra.That being said, the script can only be described as grossly disappointing. There were really two stories here.  The first is the story of Bill (Tom Cruise) and Alice (Nicole Kidman) Harford's relationship.  The second was the story of Bill's sexual odyssey resulting in his crashing of an orgy for the rich and famous.  Too much was made of the first and not enough of the second.  This should have been a psycho-sexual film noir suspense thriller. The elements were there for a good one.  Bill's penetration of the sordid inner circle of sex games of the powerful could have been a riveting thriller with proper follow through.  But instead, Kubrick chose to deflate this storyline with the unsatisfying dialogue between Bill and Victor (Sidney Pollack).  He then returned to the Harford's relationship, which was a character study in `who cares'.  He ends the film as if their relationship was the point, which left the film pointless.Other than her ability to provide sexy set dressing, Nicole Kidman was utterly superfluous in this film.  Worse yet, this was probably the most wretched performance of her career.  Kidman is not without talent and has given us some excellent performances (`Malice'; `Dead Calm').   Her performance here was tentative and strained, however.  There were times when she was so unnatural in the delivery of her lines, one would have thought she was aphasic.Tom Cruise gave an excellent performance portraying a difficult and tormented character.  It was somewhat of a departure for him to play a character that was so pent up and emotionally torn.  He hasn't taken on a part this difficult since `Born On The Fourth of July'.  Usually he plays the straightforward macho type; more action than depth.  I was pleasantly surprised by his ability to rise to the challenge of this character's complexity.I gave this film a 7/10.  The filmmaking was a 12, but the story was never developed to its full potential.  It would have been interesting to see what Alfred Hitchcock would have done with this story.  Perhaps Stanley and Alfred are talking about that right now.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

An overzealous attempt at an intellectually stimulating movie!,"For the first time in a long time I was actually excited to see a movie. The hype surrounding EYES WIDE SHUT and the irony of Kubrick's death before the movie even came close to opening brought out the butterflies in my stomach as I walked to the box office and purchased my ticket. I even had to wait a week after it came out to go so that I could see it with my girlfriend who couldn't go see it with me the week before. We wanted to tickle our imaginations by seeing Kubrick's ""final masterpiece"". I walked out of the theater utterly disappointed. I like movies with intellectual stimulation. Movies that don't impress the viewer with computerized special effects (the Mummy) or gross-out comedy (There's something about mary) though those movies can be really great to see once...I like movies that become better and better every time you see them and leave you walking out of the theater thinking about the story.EYES WIDE SHUT left me walking out of the theater saying...what just happened. I've concluded...nothing. Nothing happened. This movie tried to create a complex web of internal angst but it was only confusion. Tom Cruise gets mad at his wife for having fantasies so he walks the streets for 2 days, shell out about $1000 loosely, doesn't take advantage of the two opportunities to get back at his wife which is his mission in the first place. He stumbles across a nightmarish orgy which is totally unrealistic and a complete a completely opposite turn from the way this movie was going. The orgy seemed to pose a threat to him and his family but near the end we find out that it was only to scare him into staying quiet.When all is said in done, nothing had happened. This movie fired blanks! I waited the entire movie for a plot and it just wasn't there. The sexual content of this movie was used in excess. Sex was everywhere and in such unusual and degrading forms that it made 'making love' look like a thing of the past. The closing line by nicole kidman ""we have to do something we haven't done in a while...f**k"" left me totally hating this movie. Even sex with his own wife is considered animalistic and degrading.EYES WIDE SHUT did not deliver at all. In the end, everything was the same as it was at the beginning except that tom and nicole (bill and alice) had a marriage that was even rockier than in the beginning.

But just as the big climax was supposed to happen, it fizzled!  I heard that Kubrich had rewritten the ending not long before it was finished. I don't mean to be cruel, but I thought he must have passed away during the making of it, because it just fizzled out and died somewhere in the last half.  I am so sad that this had to be Kubrich's last film, because it had so much unused potential.

Eyes Wide Shut,"Eyes Wide Shut was Stanley Kubrick's final film. He died before the film's wide release. The film was in production for over a year requiring various re-shoots. It starred the then husband and wife team of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.Dr Bill Harford (Cruise) is a successful young doctor with his own practice, beautiful wife, young daughter and a swanky apartment in Manhattan.After attending a lavish party where Bill flirted a bit and later smoking some pot in their apartment. His wife Alice (Kidman) tells him that she once fantasised leaving him for a sexy sailor. This rocks Bill as he now keeps imagining his wife having sex with the sailor.This sets Bill on a road to strange encounters where he lets his inhibitions drop and walk the wild side of life. He meets a woman that is a hooker, a bereaved daughter lunges and kisses him. He goes to a fancy dress shop where the owner's nubile daughter gives him the come on. Bill gets an old medical school friend, now a piano player to reveal to him the location of a place where wild sex parties take place.However Bill gets caught out as an interloper in the sex orgy and realises that he might have put himself in danger, especially when a prostitute in the orgy turns up dead and his piano playing friend disappears.Bill is spurred on to confess to his wife about the dark night of his soul and his various encounters, none of which ever lead to sex.The film is beautifully filmed in a Christmas setting that allows for a lot of festive themed lights. The film was shot in London as Kubrick who having settled in Britain never left the country.Despite building a typical Greenwich Village street at Pinewood Studios it looked unauthentic.There is nothing in this movie to suggest why it took so long to shoot the film. At its heart it is just an adult drama with erotic leanings and comic absurdities.Now I know he was not known as 'One Take Kubrick' but really taking over a year to shoot the film was taking the biscuit. I once read a discussion and I think it has some validity that the reason Kubrick took so many takes was he was hoping for some kind of serendipity. A chance magical intervention that would suddenly occur which would elevate one shot from dozens of other similar ones and critics would acclaim Kubrick as some kind of wizard.During the production two actors were replaced. Sydney Pollack replaced Harvey Keitel as Ziegler the gregarious and libertine party host. Pollack was an actor turned Oscar winning director who specialised in making cameo appearances such as the startled agent in Tootsie and the shocked doctor in Death Becomes Her.Pollack also directed Cruise in The Firm. Pollack was right on the money as Ziegler the concerned friend but also a man with a seedy underbelly.Jennifer Jason Leigh was replaced by Marie Richardson as Marion the bereaved daughter who impulsively kisses Bill.The notorious orgy starts out as some kind of Roger Corman-like masked ball from The Masque of the Red Death with some kind of semi satanic rituals before descending into some laughable softcore sex scenes. Some of the over enthusiastic jiggling we get to see, well let us say the man would be slipping out a lot.The women Kubrick hired for the sex party look rather fetching with their thongs and bare breasts. Kudos to the casting director.Cruise's character is very passive with all that is going on around him including the kinkiness. He might had a sharp punch in the gut from his wife's careless words but Cruise does not reflect this. This must a be a directorial choice as Cruise is a lot better and a more expressive actor than say Matthew Modine or Ryan O'Neil that Kubrick had cast in his previous movies.The whole story is too thin and stretched out for a 160 minutes run time. The film is leisurely paced. At least Kubrick pierced the mundane setting with sudden slapstick such as the escapades of the Fancy Dress Shop owner and his daughter.Ultimately the film is about two married people who took each other for granted and failed to appreciate each other. Just look at Alice at the beginning who is peeing in the bathroom as Bill walks in and does not flinch.At the first party thrown by Ziegler, she gets propositioned by an older man and she flirts back while Bill in turn is being playful to two English ladies which Alice sees but does nothing about.Kubrick made fewer films as he got older. Eyes Wide Shut was his first film since 1987. Cruise and Kidman were prepared to put their successful film careers on hold to work for an auteur knowing that they could spend months making the film. It is just a shame that Kubrick went out on a whimper.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Beautiful fable,"Eyes Wide Shut is a horribly underrated film for everyone involved in the film, particularly Kubrick. The film needs to be viewed as a gorgeously photographed fable, twice told. Twice told because the primary character played by Tom Cruise, goes on two journeys--one at night, one in the morning retracing those nightwalking steps. Twice told because the journey begins with Nicole Kidman's questions and ends with Sydney Pollack's answers. It's also a fable because of the beautiful, glowing surroundings, the surrealist characters (the costume shop owner and his daughter for example)whether masked or not,and the constantly hovering menace. The film features Kidman at her most luminous. It's also one of her first, best mature performances and can be seen as a precursor to her blossoming as an actress in The Hours and Cold Mountain. She has two particularly fine scenes, one at the beginning of the film where she wounds Cruise, and the final one in the department store, which ends the film with a tough, bitter kick. Cruise, too, is fine in a performance that is light years ahead of the phone-it-in commercial ones he usually gives. Sydney Pollack is simply extraordinary. There are some minor flaws, mostly in editing individual scenes for length, and had Kubrick lived long enough to do the final polish on the film it would be seen as a classic look at sex, trust and marriage. As it is now, it'll have to settle for near-classic.",,Anonymous,Mystery
A shockingly real portrayal of a marriage,"This is my third favourite Kubrick movie, 2001 being my favourite and ACO being second Eyes Wide Shut is nevertheless a great movie backed by powerful performances from Cruise and Kidman. The first time I watched it I was pretty unimpressed,much like the first time I saw 2001 and that is now my favourite movie. The second time round I liked it a lot more. Eyes Wide Shut paints a very honest and mature picture of marriage and in that lies it's beauty.Despite not being married I can completely identify with Nicole Kidman,she is a bored housewife who fantasises about other men to spice up her life. When she discloses this to hubby Mr Cruise he then goes on a downhill spiral and the implications it has on their marriage. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman were brilliant in their roles as husband and wife. I suppose I may as well admit that I initially brought the DVD for Nicole Kidman and her skin show(trust me she did not disappoint me in that area) but I was not expecting to immensely enjoy it which I did. It really is an absolute shame that Mr Kubrick could not bask in it's glory for long, he died shortly after making it. Eyes Wide Shut is another addition to Mr Kubrick's fine work as a director and the industry is poorer place without him.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

More in-your-face than insightful about the role of sexual fantasies,"It's an erotic thriller set several days before Christmas in 1990s New York City. It follows a medical doctor and his wife whose fantasies are triggered at a Christmas party they attend.Dr. Bill (Tom Cruise) and Alice Harford (Nicole Kidman) have been married for nine years. They have a seven-year-old daughter, Helena (Madison Eginton). Near the film's opening, they attend a lavish Christmas party hosted by Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack) and his unseen wife. At the party, other guests hit on Bill and Alice separately, and Bill helps Victor out of a tough spot with an overdosing guest, Mandy (Julienne Davis). Bill is also reacquainted with a former med school friend, Nick (Todd Field), who now is a piano player.Later, at home, Bill and Alice get stoned. To Bill's consternation, Alice confesses to fantasies about a naval officer they had seen on an earlier vacation. This revelation triggers Bill, who then experiences a series of unfulfilled sexual experiences with the daughter of a patient who just died (Marie Richardson), a sex worker (Vinessa Shaw), a shady costume dealer (Rade Serbedzija), and daughter (Leelee Sobieski), and an orchestrated sex orgy for the one percent.Events spiral downward for Bill, including a death, a disappearance, and severe threats to his life. After a final shocking discovery on his pillow, Bill and Alice finally face their realities.""Eyes Wide Shut"" is skillfully edited and photographed. The sex is never terribly explicit, though countless breasts are displayed. Nicole Kidman portrays her role admirably. Her then-husband, Tom Cruise, is not a convincing doctor and has the irritating habit of constantly repeating what someone has just said to him. One never forgets that he's Tom Cruise. There is some excellent character acting in the troupe, but many storylines never resolve. Overall, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" seems more in-your-face than insightful about the role of sexual fantasies in marriage relationships.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Why so Underrated?,"Dr. William Hartfor has just had a fight with his wife and begins to realized that his marriage may be collapsing. As he wonders New York City he has a series of strange encounters that culminates with him visiting a strange masked ball where nothing is as it seems.I went into Eyes Wide Shut without high expectations. I am a huge Kubrick fan and I knew, since he directed it, it couldn't be a complete waste of time but due to its lack of acclaim I figured it was one of his weaker efforts. I was blown away.Eyes Wide Shut is a cinematic masterpiece that, in true Kubrick fashion, can be interpreted in innumerable ways and puzzled over for hours. Eyes Wide Shut dissects everything from marriage to sexual perversion all the while containing an ominous tone that turns it into some perverse horror story. Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise both give excellent career defining performances as does Sydney Pollack even with his extremely short screen time.I'm not sure why this isn't considered one of Kubrick's best. Virtually every movie he has made, including the disappointing Full Metal Jacket, are considered to be some of the greatest pictures to every grace a multiplex, yet Eyes Wide Shut was virtually ignored by critics and audiences alike. I guess most of his movies were misunderstood at the time of their release and the intense expectation everyone had coming in didn't help either, but don't be fooled. Eyes Wide Shut is an amazing achievement and one that you can watch over and over again. I have watched it five or six times now and every time I notice a few new things and discover another way you could interpret a specific scene or phrase.

Disappointing And Over-Long But Some Good Elements,"An overblown movie that could have been much better if it had been much shorter and directed a bit better, the whole thing is an enigma. How did so many top name talents wind up putting out such a mediocre product? Even otherwise good actors put in less-than-average performances in this one, making you wonder what direction Stanley Kubrick gave them. In other words, did Nicole Kidman decide on her own to talk incredibly slowly to the point of poor acting and unbelievability or did Kubrick tell her to do so for some unfathomable reason? I suspect (since Kidman has done much better work in other films) that Kubrick was going for some weird stylistic twist that just did not work. Tom Cruise is also unusually stiff in many scenes. The pace is too slow, too, and the characters unsympathetic. It's hard to get into a movie where you disrespect the characters. That being said, there's a basic core story here that doesn't unfold until nearly the middle of the movie that becomes interesting and should have been the focus of this movie. (One wonders what impact this movie might have had had the middle scene not been censored - with monk-like shapes placed strategically over naked bodies.) Another thing: why Kubrick felt the need to make Kidman's character a poor example of a wife is curious and gratuitous. Another stylistic annoyance: the characters' constant repeating of whatever someone says to them is really grating; both Cruise's and Kidman's characters are made to do this. Much of this movie should have wound up on the editing floor. There are too many boring scenes - even when characters are absolutely naked. Speaking of which, Kubrick's showing of Kidman's bare butt in several early scenes is gratuitous and obvious - not having its intended effect because these scenes have no reason for being in the film (at least that I can understand). She's dressing - so what? How does that move the story along? (It doesn't.) Another big gripe: the final scene limps off lamely without any real character redemption or discoveries and then ends scatologically to shock - with a gratuitous comment that only trivializes this movie and makes you wonder what Kubrick and his writers were smoking. That being said, there was a kernel of a good movie here, but it was lost in an attempt on the one hand to make a bigger picture out of this tale than exists here and to shock on the other hand (and - PS to any Hollywood director who has not learned this yet: nudity, four-letter-words and sex do not shock anymore; they can, in fact, seem cliché - as they do here). You know, what made some of the movies of the '30s so great was their crackling dialog - fast-paced, ingenious. The slow dialog in this movie produces the opposite effect - dullness. Incredible especially if you realize how many scenes of naked people are in this movie. The lesson here is clear: nudity does not make a movie interesting. A dull story is a dull story, naked people or no. Very ironic: here, one of the most boring movies ever, has perhaps the most nudity and sexual content of any mainstream film of its time. Makes you yearn for a return to the old movie ethic of the '30s. One final question remains unanswered: what about their experience (as real husband and wife) in making this movie caused Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman to divorce shortly afterward? I have to feel it had something to do with what went on during the filming of this albatross.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

So bad it was embarrassing,"What a disappointment.  Kidman and Cruise must have had stars in their eyes when they agreed to star in Kubrick's last film.  I'm kind of glad Kubrick didn't have to see the reviews for this movie....it is sad to see an icon flop.  The whole idea of the movie, that a well educated contemporary man would have some kind of breakdown when he discovered that his wife had a sexual fantasy about another man is ludicrous.  Kidman's (over)acting in her ""stoned"" scene was like a scene from ""Reefer Madness"".  I expected to see a sophisticated erotic film that delved into sexual obsession.  What I saw was a movie from a director who seemed to have a silly, old fashioned hooded cloak fetish.  I gave this movie a 1 and hope that Cruise and Kidman do better in choosing scripts in the future and forget about making ""art"" films.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The perfect end to a perfect filmmaker's career,"I don't care what anyone else says. Sure, most of them say that Steven Spielberg is the greatest, most successful director of all time (which is true to a certain extent), I will always consider Stanley Kubrick to be the quintessential image of that; he is my all-time favourite filmmaker, with a style and interpretation that resonated with me from the first few seconds I saw of ""The Shining"" (1980), my first-ever Kubrick viewing. He is a director of unequaled talent, persistence, and vision, whose fascinating persona has been notoriously publicized in tabloid news around the globe for decades. He's been labelled ""reclusive"", ""eccentric"", a ""tyrant"", a ""perfectionist"", etc. ...Call him what you will, but you cannot deny the illustrious career he's made out of creating some of the most significant motion pictures ever.That career was tragically shattered upon his death in March of 1999 - just a few months before the release of his now-final film: ""Eyes Wide Shut"", a gloomy, subdued, but hypnotic study of the human condition.Like all the rest of Kubrick's films, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" of course boasts a stunning visual style that ends up making every frame look almost like a work of art. The soft, colourful palettes used throughout the film give an eerie, surreal, almost dreamy look to it. It matches the wildly dysfunctional mood of most scenes, and really lends some first-class cinematography to the proceedings.When ""Eyes Wide Shut"" was released in the summer of 1999, I, unfortunately, was not able to see it. Of course, at the time, I still wasn't fully aware of just how unparalleled a genius Mr. Kubrick was, and I had yet to be fully appreciative of his unique body of work. A few years down the line...I finally caught an uncut television broadcast of the nearly three-hour film (since it was on TV it was over three hours, but that's besides the point). The reactions, emotions, and feelings simmering through me as I journeyed through this bizarre masterpiece cannot be fully expressed in words; I was captivated every minute, watching the horrific and sad tribulations faced by the film's lead couple - then-married ""mega-stars"" Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. I must say, for all the flak this film received about the acting when it was released, I was actually surprised at how ABOVE-average and well-done the performances were (as well as supporting roles). It clearly couldn't be easy for a real-life married celebrity couple (much less a non-couple) to pull it off with such uncomfortable, heavy subject matter. Forcing these two leads to question their own lives, the film does a remarkable job of presenting the psychological twists and turns of each spouse's state - and, of course, the famous, digitally-altered orgy cult sequence didn't fail to give me some nightmares with that chillingly simplistic piano score.There is also a number of other memorable and haunting moments to be had, obviously...and the equally talked-about ending historically concludes with the perfect one-word statement before cutting to black and having the last Kubrick credits roll.For all the legendary ""porno movie"" hype surrounding the more low-key end result, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" was apparently a gigantic disappointment to many critics and fans...but in the end, it proved that after an often-turbulent film career, one could still come out on top before abruptly leaving this world.The perfect end to a perfect filmmaker's career. Stanley Kubrick, you will forever be missed.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Kubrick's Misunderstood Masterpiece, Constructed On A Daring and Visionary Scope Of Allegory","Eyes Wide Shut has become infamous for a variety of reasons, since it is the last film Stanley Kubrick ever completed, and even then some still argue that Eyes Wide Shut never got the final cut which was intended by Kubrick before he deceased. I know many people who have seen the film for the individual reason of expecting numerous levels of erotically-charged sex. Fortunately, those viewers found something which was entirely unforeseen. Many critics ""flamed"" the film upon release, yet as each year goes by Eyes Wide Shut receives increasing critical acclaim. Another controversy was the fact that the film avoided its NC-17 by censoring the notorious orgy scene, which infuriated American audiences. Much mystery and speculation surrounds the film, making everything all the more fascinating. All of this and more comes down to one thing, the fact that Kubrick was a director who changed the face of cinema, revolutionising the way a film could be composed through even its most intricate of features.It was during the production of Eyes Wide Shut -which lasted a considerable amount of time- that Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman were in the middle stage of their marriage. Two years after the release of the film the couple filed for divorce. In the film, they perform as a married couple who suddenly befall a dysfunctional relationship after the experience of one party. This leads the couple to become wary of one-an-other and a state of surreal desire washes over Dr. William Harford (played by Tom Cruise) who suspects his wife of adultery after she admits some dark secrets through drug-induced paranoia. After viewing Eyes Wide Shut, dissect the film's features carefully, given that you will gain much more hindsight.Ironically, it was two years subsequent to Eyes Wide Shut that Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman ended their 11-year relationship. I find this interesting, since the film details topics such as martial fidelity. The narrative is composed through a somewhat fractured, distant and cold environment, epitomised by the ""vigilante quest"" that Tom Cruise's character embraces. You quickly realise that you have become a fellow protagonist in the experiences of Eyes Wide Shut, never quite knowing what is around the most ambiguous of corners. The human psyche is a difficult emotion to convey through acting, let alone directing. When released, Eyes Wide Shut was considered out-of-touch with the film-making of its time, yet I would say the film was a long way ahead of the cinema being released during the '90s. For example, the film studies many social trends buried inside the infrastructure of modernised society. A book of sociology can be seen during one scene, perfectly placed to echo Kubrick's own motifs.Arguably, Kubrick offers his fans a surreal take on a desire which affects every man and woman at some point in their life. Something that is important to be acknowledged when comprehending Eyes Wide Shut is that the majority of it was filmed on a soundstage at Pinewood Studios, London. At the time of release, critics argued that this made the film feel ""unlike New York"", yet this was an intention of the film. It echoes the surreal, dream-like state of the film, conveying the nature of a wide environment, which opens the viewer to personally analyse the features included within the gapingly open landscape. Eyes Wide Shut is a film whereby every aspect is open, such as the characters being exposed to let their own emotions walk free through an indistinct style of script-writing. The film is one which is open to viewer elucidation; even the title of the work has been debated as being the key to supporting the often cited ""dream theory"".Built on an ambiance resembling that of a period-drama, the film actually has many elements of tension, some might even go so far as to say horror. When you look at a scene, like that of the infamous masked-orgy sequence there is a real dread that starts to build up within the viewer, since the environment is superficially unnerving, bizarre and ultimately quite terrifying. The danger presented within the scene is that of an authoritative nature, which does not manipulate the audience, but instead makes them think about the people behind the masks. Yet, it is notably apparent that the sequence is not only a study of lust, covetousness suspicion and the craving for psychological stability, but it is also metaphorically speaking- a look at high-class society members at a substantial advantage in power.The copious use of the ""Kubrickian"" steadicam is that of significant poise, resonated by the trademark tracking-shots of Kubrick, which subtly scrutinise environments to a profoundly postured degree. The use of Italian architecture and sceptically shadowed lighting igniting the film's scenery and character's emotions plays an important role for much of the subtext. The abrasive, menacing score polarises the personality of the key players within the narrative, helping make everything all the more analytical in its refined style. A fundamental aspect of the feature is the allegory and allusions created by the use of paintings, sculptures, architectures and the dream-states which are personified through the screenplay. Another crucial basis of Eyes Wide Shut is the fact it is depicting barren, upper-class individuals who need to find a connotation to their lives, primarily due to the frustration that has been gained through boredom. This is all shown through the faultless acting from Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, who both offer the finest performances of their careers, bursting with unquestionable flavour and chemistry. The expressionistic technicalities should be contrasted against the complex hypothesis of the film.Eyes Wide Shut deserves to be watched multiple times for the viewer to fully digest and appreciate the experience of what is an unprecedented, flawless and misjudged masterpiece which delves inside the darkest realms of human psyche. Even if you are one of the haters, I know for a fact that it is impossible for you to forget a film like Eyes Wide Shut.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The movie can be viewed in multiple ways.,"Replace the adults at the secret gathering with kids and you have a profound movie. Was Kubrick trying to expose pedophilia amongst powerful people? Who knows, but it makes the movie much more profound. It explains why Dr. Bill's life is threatened. Also, turn on the closed captions when the young girl whispers in Cruise's ear. She tells him to get a cloak lined with Ermine. Ermine was worn by royalty. It also symbolizes moral purity or innocence. Why does the movie use pedophilia as bookends for the orgy scene?The movie is spooky, and also unbelievably complex. There is a strange amount of ""Grail"" imagery in the prostitute scene. Notice the immense amount of ""V's"" in the entire scene from her clothes to the way the Christmas lights are hung. Before the orgy there are also two road signs which have a ""V"" and an upside down ""V"" symbolizing the masculine and the feminine.Overall, the movie is about much more than relationships and sex. It is sort of like a Da Vinci painting. It's true meaning may take years to figure out.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Best Film of 1999,"""Eyes Wide Shut"" weaves its web of psychological carnage with a power that has nothing to do with taste, or preference. Kubrick's images are undeniable and very, very startling. The eye must watch. There is a remarkable trademark of Kubrick's that lies in his spacing of dialogue. It is never as simple as ""He said"" - cut to Her - ""She said"". That is the formula, but Kubrick always cuts away early. He leaves a discernible pause. This creates a note of discord (emphasized in the music score with its jarring one-note piano stabbings), in that everyone who speaks in his films appear to be studying one another. People speak in measured tones, but rarely communicate themselves well to one another. Many have spoken of Kubrick's ""coldness"" as a filmmaker, and it is true that he always keeps his characters at arm's length, distancing them from each other and us. But the reason behind this would appear to be that in doing so, the film's eye catches everything. Nothing gets overlooked in the heat of the moment, in the messiness of emotional embrace. We watch Kubrick's players watch.I have heard tell of a comparison with ""The Matrix"", which I find especially perceptive. Here, the matrix is created by us, by our own psychological make-up. Which of course is more terrifying and pessimistic, as well as more truthful. While Kubrick unsettles with his world of penetrating observers, there are moments of participatory activity, but tellingly, it occurs in dream. Kidman's character is frightened by her dreams of actively humiliating and degrading her husband, more still because she secretly revels in it. Cruise, on the other hand, goes on a tripped-out 48 hour adventure in which he tries desperately to play the role of ""outsider"" his wife so desires, only to be discovered, revealed and publicly shamed. Kubrick's contrasts are obvious, but sooooo compelling: Kidman is active and cruel in her dream-life, Cruise is passive and reflective in his waking existence. As the film ultimately asks at its conclusion, is one more innocent than the other?""Eyes Wide Shut"" may not be the most optimistic portrayal of a marriage and its strengths, but Kubrick has again, and sadly for the last grand time, allowed us to see through his eyes a world where the notion of communication is not taken for granted. His people struggle to express, and seem all the more human for it. Let it be said that Kubrick's eyes were always wide open, and to the details most of us figured too mundane to truly appreciate. He will be greatly missed.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Disappointing farewell for Stanley Kubrick-a movie that was overpromoted,"Stanley Kubrick was a director who was said to have made a number of masterpieces among his movies.I don't consider ""Eyes Wide Shut"" to beamong them.Although Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman(who is nicely photographed in this movie,although some of the shots of her become tiresome after a while)were still married in real life when this movie was made, they appear to lack passion together in this movie.When I first found out about this movie,I went to see it in the movies and walked out part of the way through because I found itto be too slow and not interesting.I saw it on video,however,and although it seemed slightly less slow on tape than it did inthe theater,it is still a disappointing movie,I think,for severalother reasons.1) It is a movie that could have been a half hour shorter and been more effective. 2) The plot is not all that strong;Cruise's sexual odyssey is not an overly big deal in that more doesn't happen with himthan does,although he is on that odyssey in reaction to what his wife DIDN'T do with the sailor.Also,the last third of themovie rings flat,especially with the scenes where the mask that Cruise wore at the orgy is in bed next to Kidman and whereCruise met with Sydney Pollack at the end(which was a weak ""wrap up"" scene,so to speak.) 3) Although the women looked fairly good and there was a lot of nudity and sex in this movie,it WAS NOT a movie that was erotic,in my opinion.I think that the promotion for this movie was in OVERKILL mode over how erotic this movie was going to be.It was a cold movie and not anything that would be that exciting,so to speak.The orgy scene was more weird than anything that would be a turn on,not to mention that the music is overbearing. 4) Finally,the ending was one of those scenes that could be described as a case of ""What?"".That was a weak ending to a movie that is on the ridiculous side and seems to have run out of steam before the end.In short,this was not a terrible movie,but not the greatest of endings for Kubrick's career and a disappointing movie for both Cruise and Kidman,although they both can act very well and have done so in their movies.I give this movie a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10.One final comment on ""Eyes Wide Shut"",DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE! well.The story was not there for them this time.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

This movie, is also, extremely psychological, because you constantly have to think what is happening, and think about the characters, and what they are thinking. A noticeable element in the film, is that there is a lot of suspense, which just makes it that more amazing. The whole movie, was planned, there is not a moment, metaphorically speaking, that you walked, or stepped away from the path that was built. The movie can be watched over, and over again.

It Was Not Predictable But Was Certainly A Disappointment!,"Eyes Wide Shut is a mixed bag of good and bad. The one thing it has going for it is that you will not be able to predict the ending. Speaking of the ending, it left me wanting more. This is an often unbelievable story of a man's journey into to a sexual adventure that becomes his worst nightmare. Cruise, was not at his best, as a young doctor with a lovely wife and daughter. His practice is successful and he and his wife get invited to a party in which they go their separate ways. Kindman does a great job as the doctor's wife who is also having sexual thoughts of her own. I must say it kept my interest though you will have to wait a while for things to develop and go somewhere. The bottom line is that this is a toss up. Some will like it and others will get up and walk out of the theatre before the ending of the film. Though not a sexual turn on to me, others might feel that it goes a bit too far.

There are so many questions left unanswered and a lot of the stuff is truly ambiguous in a good way. True masterwork.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Visually Stunning, but Left an Empty Feeling","This movie had all of the makings of a typical Kubrick movie:  slow development, great camera angles, developed characters, the ability to surprise and shock.  I felt that the movie had some elements in it that rank among Kubrick's best, but also some of the worst.  Among the the best was the feeling that I watched an hour and a half movie that was actually more than an hour longer.  However, on the negative side, Tom Cruise was one of his worst casting choices.  He has so little range, and brought so little to what could have been a classic part.  It pained me to see the interaction between Cruise and his real life wife, Nicole Kidman.  She was wonderful.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A bad, annoying, nearly 3 hour episode of All My Children.","Eyes Wide Shut is a shallow, appalling mess of a film which will no doubt be hailed as high art by the baby boom crowd. I suppose this sort of thing is what white bread America, particularly the repressed crowd I saw it with, imagines to be avant garde. Some phrases I heard from those around me in the theater: ""I can't believe we're going to see this!"" ""This is too weird!"" ""Is that marijuana?"" ""Is she a prostitute?"" ""Oh, she isn't worthy of him!"" ""Thank God he didn't have sex with her!"" ""Oh, look. That's a nice apartment."" Please. I've had racier things go on in my car than any of the sex or so-called orgy scenes in this film, and yet it was giving the fat, status-obsessed yuppies around me a case of the vapors. Eyes wide shut, indeed. An endless, overwrought, melodramatic morality play about sex and guilt. Nothing more. Imagine being taken on a tour of Studio 54 in its heyday while being flogged by a nun. The women in this film ranged from coked-out whores to merely dysfunctional housewives looking for some on the side. The one gay character with lines was stereotyped as a mincing little queen made almost faint by the overwhelming sexual prowess of Tom Cruise. Give me a break! Racial stereotyping was also pervasive, and not one moment of this film's so-called plot was unpredictable. If Kubrick hadn't croaked, this movie would have received all the rotten (and more to the point, honest) reviews it is due. Hell, the pace alone probably killed him. Anyway, if you enjoy being tortured for almost three hours, go see this film. If you're as fortunate as myself, you will get to see it with a bunch of sanctimonious Midwesterners, in which case you will find the audience's reaction more entertaining than what's on the screen.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Bored at 1st viewing, became interested by the 3rd time.","This one is really a brain teaser. Since I know Mr. Kubrick only made movies with a lot of depth to it, thus I know there must be a lot more to what was appeared to the surface. By my 3rd viewing, things start to click.Hint 1:The title""Wide eyes shut"" means we have been blind by our ego and we are not seeing the Big G at work. Hint 2: Tom Cruise always got saved from death at the last moment.I still don't get the mask on the pillow scene that triggered Tom Cruses's enlightenment. If anyone know, please post the answer.Like I said, this one is a great brain stimulator. If you like this type of movies, check out the last two movies by Kurosawa.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A great movie after 15 years,"This film is a work of genius that, like all Kubric films, is open to many interpretations. The art of this film remains its slow, thoughtful pace, camera angles and distances, facial studies, colour and ingenious set designs. The original music of Jocelyn Pooke provides the necessary extra voice and story that gives this film the unique feel it has. 'Eyes Wide Shut' is a study in psychology and nerve, human weakness and how we might overcome those weaknesses.Many interpretations have been given of 'Eyes Wide Shut', and I agree that Kubric invites us to think carefully about his films, offering no definitive answers. However, I offer my own view of what I think is going on with the story of Bill and Alice Harford in this piece of cinema noire. Throughout the film, there are a series of clues dotted around the canvas like a puzzle of separate pieces, and yet bound by a common thread.At the heart of the story are the married couple, Bill and Alice, who have marital problems. Alice, whilst telling of a sexual fantasy, doesn't actually enter into any kind of affair. Bill, jealous of Alice's fantasy, is seen walking into a series of temptations and embracing them. These temptations are rather like those described in the Garden of Eden story with Adam and Eve succumbing to temptation.With Bill, it is his night walking and encounters with women in different situations that present his weaknesses. The one moment in the film that, for me, triggered thoughts about the Genesis story were the words of the masked woman at the hedonistic party who steps in to save Bill, saying she will redeem him. Who might she be to offer redemption? At that moment, the other parts of that central section of the film became clearer. The naked people seen copulating with each other is, for me, humans functioning as they should, to multiply. Naked flesh is not presented so much as erotic but rather as humankind exposed for what it is, as a sexually functioning race.Bill is frail, showing fear as much as pleasure at the encounters he is having with the women he meets. The death of Mandy, a prostitute he first meets at Victor Zeigler's party, is a symbol of how life is. Destroy your body with drugs, and you will eventually die.Life is frail, but we have to be strong and make better decisions, and that is what this film is about. It is brilliant and a great testimony as Stanley Kubric's final film.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not one of my fav movies, but Cruise makes it worthwhile","I heard good reviews of EWS so I downloaded the divx version of it. Since it was free and all I have no complaints.  Some people had told me this movie had no plot, but I thought it had a deep and intricate plot!There were many parts of the movie that were left unexplained, or they don't explicitly say what happened (don't you just hate that?)... so that's mostly why I didn't like it that much.  But after reading other people's interpretations and discussions on the bbs, I got some insight on what the hell was going on. Also... the movie was long.  2 and 1/2 hours.  and halfway through I was wondering when it would be over. To end on a more positive note, I like most Tom Cruise movies and he was great in this one as well.  So his presence redeemed this movie somewhat and made the 2 and 1/2 hrs seem less of a drag. I definitely would not recommend renting or buying this movie to anyone UNLESS you're a Cruise or Kidman fan.  If it was some other actor that I'm not a particularly big fan of, then I would definitely regret having wasted those 2.5 hours of my life.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Kubrick's slightest film,"On repeat viewing, this is my least favourite Kubrick film. I do not think his leads are up to the task. Cruise is simply okay, as he often is, but Kidman is really quite terrible. Kubrick has a tendency to let his characters overact which can work out well (George C. Scott in ""Dr. Strangelove"") or not so well (Patrick Magee in ""A Clockwork Orange). In Kidman's case, it's quite disastrous. 2 1/2 hours is far too long for such a slight story, and it seems to have been stretched out by slowing the dialogue to a deathly pace in most scenes. While the plot largely follows Schnitzler's novel, he has replaced the novel's conclusion with a puzzlingly arbitrary resolution that seems completely detached from the plot that precedes it.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Successful as an artistic piece of work but not always as a movie.,"""Eyes Wide Shut"" is strange and has a very unusual story with multiple layers, symbolism and moments that remain unexplained. From an artistically point of view the movie is beautifully crafted. There are some beautifully shot sequence's and the nudity and sexual moments in the movie are brought in a beautiful, artistic way. It's really like you're watching a painting at times. As a movie the movie simply isn't always interesting enough and it doesn't leave an huge impression afterward. The unaccessible story also doesn't add to the reachability of the movie. It's beautifully made and shot all but it still as a somewhat disappointing last Kubrick movie despite the fact that I still rate this movie quite highly.Kubrick in his movies always tries to create a world on its own through its always somewhat typical unusual atmosphere. This movie never really succeeds an 100% in creating a good and believable unusual world on its own. Kubrick movies always have a beautiful but yet accessible and understandable unusual atmosphere while this movie just simply has an unusual, unusual atmosphere. It certainly provides the movie with some beautiful artistic moments but the more casual viewer will feel very distant from the movie and its story while watching this movie.The movie certainly is perfectly directed and the actors really give all they've got. I think it really is the story that makes this movie an unaccessible and far from perfect movie.Is it a worthy last Kubrick movie? Well, in my opinion yes. Even though this will not be the movie that he will always be remembered for, it still is a movie that has lots of typical Kubrick moments present, which makes this movie a must see for his fans. Perhaps that is also why this movie is just mainly only truly recommendable to the Kubrick fans.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
