2 most annoying kid actors ever,"I love the book and overall theme of the movie but Tom Cruise acting is annoying which is probably because he had to work with 2 most annoying kid actors ever seen on the film.
I mean almost every scene is ruined by hysterical yelling of the 3 main characters. Little girl is the worst but Tom and his movie son are not far behind.I mean it's watchable but by the middle of the movie I was hoping aliens will take them down so we don't have to suffer this atrocity of acting",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A brilliant alien invasion film for the first two acts,"What Spielberg, Cruise, and Koepp accomplish here in the first two acts is nothing short of revolutionary. They've made a big-budget summer blockbuster about massive destruction and action that manages to studiously avoid every cliché and expectation of such films. It stays resolutely on the characters' points of view, showing us almost nothing they don't see, even to the point of coming tantalizingly close to a raging battle, then avoiding showing it. It keeps its focus on character instead of spectacle. The ""hero"" of the piece remains decidedly unheroic, wanting only to escape, and trying to talk others out of fighting back. The purpose of every piece of action is to frighten and disturb rather than thrill, making ingenious use of familiar 9/11 imagery. At the end of the second act, it is hands-down the best alien invasion film ever made, and perhaps one of the best sci-films of all time.Then something strange happens. The filmmakers lose their nerve, and remember that this is an extremely expensive summer film financed by two studios. Or perhaps it was the fact that it stars Tom Cruise, who up to this point has spent almost two hours doing nothing but run for his life. Suddenly, and tragically, the film changes, violating not only its carefully established tone, but its own internal logic. Suddenly, Cruise begins to act like a hero, and summer action clichés force their way into the story like a worm into an apple. The transition is jarring, and it creates a serious disconnect from the story.While it's true that Wells' original ending creates a problem for a movie, here they try to remain faithful to it, while still shoehorning moments of triumph into the conclusion. Unfortunately, these moments come off as alternately false, unbelievable, and meaningless, since it isn't mankind that defeats the invaders in the end.Is it recommendable? Well, I suppose that depends on what kind of viewer you are. If you feel that 75% brilliant material overshadows the 25% that falls apart, then you'll enjoy it. If, however, you're the kind of viewer who feels that the final impression a movie makes is its ultimate stamp on your memory, you may be in for a crushing disappointment. On the other hand, if you're the kind of viewer who just likes the cliché of the boom-boom summer action spectacle, you're likely to be bored and frustrated with the first two acts, and only engage in the end. It is confused about what audience it's trying to reach, and consequently, isn't likely to satisfy any of them.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Cool effects, annoying characters",This movie would be a whole lot better if the characters weren't so annoying *ahem* Fanning. The effects look great and the storyline is interesting. The characters lack depth and are so bad that you end up not caring if they live or die.,6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Tom Cruise's Kids are Worse than the Martians,"I've never seen such petulant spoiled- rotten kids. The world is ending, and they scream and whine about every little detail. The older boy is the worst, he wants to fight the invaders...who have forcefields that can block ballistic missiles. These kids need a good spanking.The Martians devouring those brats and spraying their remains all over the place would've redeemed this mediocre effort.Aliens bury their ships underground. I'd like to know who came up with that nonsense. Like Humans who build tunnels and huge mines would never stumble on to these gigantic tripod machines. Spielberg what were you thinking?",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great CGI but there are problems,"Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) is a divorced father with daughter Rachel (Dakota Fanning) and angry teenager Robbie (Justin Chatwin). Then a strange storm appears with numerous intense lightning. Suddenly machines rise out of the ground to destroy mankind.Director Steven Spielberg uses all his tech skills to create great CGI of this H.G. Wells vision. It looks great. There are great individual scenes like the train. Tom Cruise is good as a father looking out for his family. But a couple of things keep coming back to nag at me. The kids are a bit too much to take. I'm willing to take Dakota Fanning screaming at everything, but I can't take the annoying rebellious teen. The constant fighting with the father is so petty and so childish. The family melodrama just diminishes the scale of the movie. Then there is the change of the origins of the alien machines. It is simply a stupid idea from Spielberg to be different. There is no reason for it. Worst it makes the movie questionable. And the blood idea just adds to the silliness of the story. These are changes for the sake of changing without improving anything.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Low Expectations = Pleasant Surprise,"It pays to have low expectations. Hearing nothing but negative remarks about this film, I never saw it until the other day when a friend offered the DVD for a free look. With nothing to lose, and being familiar with the story having seen the 1953 movie several times, I put it on.Wow, I enjoyed it; the film was very entertaining. The only annoying thing to me was the bratty teenage boy, who needed some discipline and never got it. However, that type of kid seems to be stereotypical of teens among modern filmmakers. Other than him, and his little sister who I put with because it's Dakota Fanning, the film served its purpose beautifully, namely to 'shock and awe.' That it did.The Martian tripods were awesome, particularly in the long scene when they first appear out of the ground. To really appreciate this film, you have to have a surround system because the sound is fantastic. In fact, earlier with the ""lightning strikes,"" the sound gets attention in a big-way. In other words, special- effects-wise, it isn't just about visuals but the audio as well.Although the story of the father (Tom Cruise) and his two estranged (is anyone pictured married in films nowadays?) kids is so-so at best, the film is all about the action. That ""cute"" family situation is just a sub-plot to give us some breaks from the intensity of the invasion.Anyway, some of the action scenes were jaw-dropping good and, with the normal Spielberg garbage that always comes with the good stuff, too, it's still was a fun two hours. Now, I'll have to get the DVD because I would definitely watch this more than once.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Plot holes like craters, but a scary ride anyway","""War of the Worlds"" is Steven Spielberg's third movie in which extraterrestrials visit Earth, but the first in which their intentions are malevolent. It can't be coincidence that the arrival of the ETs is heralded with eerie lights flashing amid lowering clouds, as in ""CE3K."" From there, the similarity ends--no light show as friendly aliens come in for a closer look. These creatures (presumably Martians, as in the original H.G. Wells novel) aren't interested in making nice; nor is there any ambiguity about their ultimate objective (as there was for much of ""CE3K""). They're here to wipe us off the face of the planet, plain and simple, a point we understand before the movie has played for even half an hour, and the giant walking tripods they deploy are remorselessly efficient. So, too, is the movie--at scaring the hell out of us, notwithstanding some gaping plot holes (what's up with that camcorder, anyway?) and a couple of sequences that are too reminiscent of other movies (particularly ""Independence Day"" and Spielberg's own ""Jurassic Park"").That Spielberg uses imagery alluding to 9/11, the Holocaust, and perhaps the siege of London during World War II is, for me, less an exploitation than a reflection of how seriously he intends the audience to take the on screen mayhem. The atmosphere is heavy with threat, and the depiction of a populace numb with shock amid the devastation is chillingly convincing, despite a few moments of Hollywood cheese. We don't have Will Smith delivering snappy one-liners right after millions are massacred by the invading alien forces, a la ""ID4."" Nor is there much of a rah-rah, let's-kick-some-alien-ass mood as the outmatched Earthlings try fighting back. Even the ostensible protagonist (a low-key, effective Tom Cruise) crumples at one point under the enormity of what's happening.I'm not really sure what the posters who complained of insufficient action and FX were talking about. Seems to me the tripods were pretty much a constant presence (if not always in the foreground) from about the 15-minute mark onward. And in fact the ""war"" of the title is waged from the beginning--it's just not on the level of humans vs. aliens combat that some viewers apparently were expecting.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
War of the two halves,"'War of the Worlds' had a lot going for it, considering the story, that it was directed by Steven Spielberg and a decent cast on paper. It turned however to be a frustratingly uneven film, with a good first half and a pretty lousy second half.Starting with what's good, the film looks fabulous, the atmosphere that the cinematography and lighting evoked is just incredible and the special effects are without complaint too. John Williams can be relied upon to compose a good score and he does here, being both rousing and spooky. Spielberg does an impeccable job directing the first half of the film, giving a lot of the first half thrills, suspense and genuine scares.Tom Cruise does a good job in the lead and Tim Robbins is eerily eccentric. As said, the first half has many great moments and is filled with unnerving suspense and scary chills. Truly imaginative details like the burning train, the birds/tripod scene and the river of the dead bodies burn in the memory for a long while after.However, the human drama was not as transfixing as it should have been, being hurt by the dysfunctional family subplot being rammed down the throat with no subtlety at all with nothing relatable at all and especially by the kids.Spielberg has demonstrated before that he is capable of directing great child performances, prime examples being Haley Joel Osment in 'AI' and Christian Bale in 'Empire of the Sun', but the performances of both Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin are incredibly irritating. Not sure which is more so, Fanning's constant screaming or brattiness or Chatwin made to act throughout the film but especially the second half like an indecisively written character who makes stupid decisions and acts rebellious in the most insufferable of ways. The dialogue is often insipid.After a lot of promise in the first half, 'War of the Worlds' is let down significantly by the second half where the pace slackens (a notable example being that overlong scene in the basement) and the suspense dramatically wilts (such as when the aliens are introduced, and they are not menacing in the slightest) and is replaced by ridiculousness, frustrating character decisions and sentimentality. The Hollywood schmaltz kicks in and keeps assaulting the viewer at full throttle, while the ending is up there as one of film's most false, cloying and anti-climactic.In conclusion, a frustratingly uneven film that starts off quite well and then completely falls apart. 5/10 Bethany Cox",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Underrated,"I feel like this movie is beyond underrated and gets voted down due to people not liking how different it is from the novel. This is a great sci fi film. Looks great, well acted, good story and a unique take on the original. 7.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Blue Collar Protagonist,"Stephen Spielberg took the 1953 classic War Of The Worlds and remade it for modern times and the modern techniques of special effects. A lot of things that could not be done back in the 50s are done now to show the havoc that the invaders reek upon the world.He also did something else that possibly might have offended science fiction purists but I think gave the audience a better identification with the protagonists of the story. Instead of having his protagonists be scientists as Gene Barry and Ann Robinson were in 1953, Tom Cruise is a blue collar divorced father who has his kids visiting him, but custody is with their mother Miranda Otto.The kids are no prizes and are played by Justin Chatwyn and Dakota Fanning. And Cruise himself is no bargain either. But when danger develops it's his idea to take them from New York to Boston where their mother and maternal grandparents are. The film as it was in 1953 is mostly concerned with their efforts to avoid the terrible tripod machines that the aliens use in their destructive path.The film does follow the Barry/Robinson escape scenario closely. The two had a scene avoiding the aliens while they were trapped in a cellar. To that Spielberg adds survivalist Tim Robbins. I think Stephen Spielberg feels the way I do that a lot of these survivalists pray for their doomsday fantasy to come true. That was sure the case with Tim Robbins who is quite mad on the subject of the invaders.Cruise himself centers and anchors the film with his portrayal of blue collar America who just wants for him and his family to survive the holocaust. This classic may yet see a remake or three in the future.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Could have been a real classic but is an above average alien-invasion movie instead.,"This movie had huge potential. Everything to make this a science-fiction classic masterpiece were present; Spielberg's directing, a great concept, ILM special effects, Tom Cruise as the main character and lots of other professionals involved both in front and behind the cameras. Then where did it go wrong? The answer to that is the script. The story is very simple and lacks a real clear plot line. Basically the movie is only about Tom Cruise and his two children running and driving from city to city, from the aliens and their destructive Tripod-machines. Exactly why are we, out of all the people, following these persons? The character development is lacking, just as much as the story does. Both lack development and depth.Of course the movie is by no means an horrible movie but it's just that the movie is a bit disappointing because of the fact that it had so much more potential. It still is a good and certainly spectacular movie to watch but it's not a movie people will still talk about in 5 or 10 years from now. The story makes this movie a bit of an easily forgettable movie that doesn't leave an huge impression afterward, even though the movie itself is pure eye-candy to watch.There is no doubt about it that Spielberg is a great director. He directs his actors in this movie very well and everyone in the movie gives an amazing performance, especially Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning. Tom Cruise for once again doesn't play the action hero. He is an average Joe instead and I think he did this in a very good and convincing. Spielberg also uses the special effects very well. He doesn't use the special effects to impress the audience as much as possible, with lots of spectacular and action filled sequences, which he could had easily had done, he uses them as a tool to tell the story with instead. The movie is purely told from Tom Cruise and his family's perspective, because of this the movie gets a very realistic feeling. We don't get to see any close-ups of the Tripods and how they destroy entire cities and fight off the American army. I like this approach. It makes ""War of the Worlds"" different from many other alien-invasion movies. It because of this certainly is one of the most believable and realistic alien-invasion movies, along with ""Signs"".Visually there also is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie. The special effects from ILM are very impressive and look extremely convincing. The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski is also simply phenomenal at times and is typically gritty, which certainly adds to the tense and realistic atmosphere of the movie.Unlike others, to me the ending didn't came really abrupt. But perhaps this was because to me the ending was already spoiled, thanks to the movie it's soundtrack, which featured the final narration of Morgan Freeman explaining how the movie ended. So I already knew what to expect. To be perfectly honest I liked the ending and I couldn't think of any other, or better way to end this movie, without losing any of its realism and credibility. I can understand how it might seem lame and sudden to most though but for me it was satisfying enough.It certainly is a movie that will receive one or two, most likely, technical Acedemy Awards. And it deserves to. There isn't an awful lot wrong with this movie but it truly is the simple story that prevents this movie from being a classic or masterpiece. I still regard this movie as one of the must sees of 2005 simply because of the movie its look and acting. You can tell by watching this movie that there was lots of talent involved, both in front and behind the cameras. Especially Spielberg's touch still makes this movie better than just the average alien-invasion movie but still not even he can prevent this movie from being a bit of a disappointment. Not his or anybody else his/her fault, simply blame it on the script.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A good take on the Wells story.  Better than the 1953 classic in some ways,"First - a quick rebuttal: The peanut butter sandwich which seemed to stick to the window impossibly. This was a very visually interesting scene. In fact, the scene was shot from inside the house, and Cruise was shot in reflection against the window - so there is no problem here other than the reviewer not thinking what they were seeing through.Now on to the review...This film follows Tom Cruise - playing a not-very-adult divorced father - and his two kids through the Wellsian version of The War of the Worlds. Despite the fact that the film focuses exclusively on the harrowing experiences of this somewhat dysfunctional family, in a very basic way it preserves the elements of the original novel. As with Wells' book, a science savvy viewer will pick up on the biological plausibility of the main plot and realize the brilliance of Wells original points. Scientifically educated viewers will also recognize the geological impossibility of it. Neither of these facts should detract from the entertainment value of this interesting and exciting film. After all, it is a testament to Wells' genius that a novel written nearly 100 years ago still holds our attention today, and is still regarded as an intelligent take on improbable events.An alien species, about which nothing is really known, has been planning to take over and terraform earth for millenia, or perhaps much longer. Using unknown technology, they manage to emplace operatives in enormous tripod machines equipped with horrendous weapons that basically carbonize any life forms they take aim at. The tripods had been implanted deep in the earth long before the advent of our species. There simply is no stopping the invasion. Cruise, whose character is not really built for heroism, digs deep into his soul to protect his children as they attempt to make it to Boston to reunite with his estranged wife and her new family.Before I discuss the technical merits of the film, and the lavish production values, I feel that I need to make a comment on Dakota Fanning. Ms. Fanning gives one of the best performances I have ever seen a sub-12 year old give in The War of the Worlds. She is a match for Cruise, and actually manages to steal several scenes from him. The acting in this film is uniformly good, but Fanning really stood out.Spielberg and his team make seemingly impossible film visions come alive in a uniquely well realized manner. War of the Worlds is one of the most visually stunning films I have seen in a long time. Though I would not call the special effects innovative, they are, more importantly, convincing and never over-done. The nearly first person story telling technique is both original and effective, and the non-heroism of Cruise's character makes for a much more compelling plot than I expected to see. There are indeed some problems with believability, but let me ask - why would anybody go to this film expecting something more realistic than a fairy tale?Recommended for Wells fans, fans of the original 1953 adaptation, and action sci-fi fans. Mildly recommended to the average cinema-goer.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
There's More to the Movie Than Meets the Eye.,"Spielberg and company created a wonderful film that's incorporated some of H.G. Wells' original novel, and the 1953 film.It took me a few viewings to spot some of the clever parts of the film. For example, when Tom Cruise's character shakes the white dust of disintegrated humans out of his hair, it's an homage to the part of the novel in which the hero's hair turns white (from fear).Cruise's character (Ray, as in ray gun) is introduced to as as a person who operates a crane that lifts up truck trailers. The invaders have similar cranes - their scary, giant tripods - that can walk and lift up humans. And yes, the aliens have ray guns.Ray's ex-wife admonishes him to make sure her son completes his school assignment by the end of the weekend, which is a paper about the occupation of Algeria by the French. Over the course of the weekend, which is the timeline in which the movie unfolds, Ray's son definitely completes his assignment, learning all about the occupation of earth by an alien force.And of course, the grandparents glimpsed at the end of the film were the stars of the 1953 film.I'm sure there's more allusions to the book and the earlier film, and homages to both. What I have picked up makes the movie even more satisfying for me.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Nutshell Review: War of the Worlds,"War of the Worlds marks the second collaboration between 2 of Hollywood's most influential figures, that of director Steven Spielberg and megastar Tom Cruise. In this updated adaptation of H.G. Well's classic, we revisit alien territory already familiar with Spielberg (with evergreens like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and E.T.), except that this time around, the aliens are not an iota friendly and wastes no time proving its point with its laser beams.Cruise plays Ray, a middle class salaried worker whose ex-wife (Miranda Otto, in an underused role) leaves their estranged kids with for the weekend. Being the selfish carefree man that he is, it is no wonder why he doesn't get much respect, especially from his son. Before you can say move on with the melodrama, worldwide lightning phenomenon gets TV coverage, and soon enough, the horror begins, as the well known battle tripods rise from beneath the earth and annihilate everything on site.The special effects are brilliant, and serves as an effective plot device for unspeakable, unexplainable horror. Spielberg teases you with indirect shots of the tripods, from mirrors and reflective surfaces, never letting you see from a first person's perspective for too long, keeping in pace with the initial suspense built.Terrorist attacks were mentioned in conversation, and perhaps this movie also serves as a timely reminder of always being prepared, with emergency equipment, stashes of food, and familiarity with emergency procedures.This film could take the easy way out and focus on the big explosions ala Independence Day, but since that was already done, we get to focus on the smaller picture, that of the survival of the family unit in crisis, and I applaud this approach. Conflicts arise and sometimes solved through unpopular decisions, and that's the way of life. Most times we do not have complete information, and need to make split second life determining decisions.However, the pace slackens toward the end of the movie, and steers us back with reminders that this is after all a summer action blockbuster, with predictable endings, some plot loopholes and worse, rushed explanations.Tom Cruise doesn't get to flash his pearly whites so often here, as we see a transformation from irresponsibility, and in his son's opinion, cowardice, to courageous dad whose children are his first priority. I'd dare say Cruise is in his element here, saving the day (in a not so direct manner).Dakota Fanning shines as Ray's daughter Rachel, bringing forth a sense of vulnerability with her fear of enclosed spaces, and her love for her father and brother. Being the little damsel in distress, who wouldn't want to save her and ensure that she survives this horrible onslaught? Serves well as a Hollywood summer blockbuster, but not the ""most anticipated"" for this year as claimed by some.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Unnatural Disaster,"The first half hour it leaves hour breathless. The characters don't know what hit them, but we do. We know all about it, a world of the worlds is about to take place, with nasty creatures from outer space. This elementary rule, we, the audience are a few steps ahead of the characters on the screen. It makes our anticipation of their realization an spectacular thrill. Then, of course, it's all downhill from there. Well, not all. Tom Cruise is in it. I have to hand it to him. Looking at his name in the poster, lots of useless but unavoidable information came to mind. Katie Holmes and Brooke Shields and L Ron Hubbard, Oprah, Matt. The lot. And I'm one who doesn't watch much television, imagine someone who does! In any case, much to Tom Cruise credit, I completely forgot all that nonsense as the movie started and I was able to concentrate on the nonsense at hand. He is really good. I took him seriously. I felt for him. He's playing a loser with an empty refrigerator and I believe it. Totally. The problems in the movie are of a different kind. The same way that you can't mix Kubrick and Spielberg and A.I was a blatant example of that. In War of the Worlds we discover H G Wells and Spielberg don't go together either. Wells, H. G as well as Orson Welles played with our inner fears without computer generated images. I imagine that playing with the intellect would have been too frightening to Spielberg, Paramount, Amblin and Dreamworks. So I guess that part of the master plan was to give us something of what, they imagine, audiences the world over expects of them. But, it doesn't work like that. It should be the intellectual wallop of H G Wells or the sentimental pyrotechnics of Steven Spielberg. Together, they do not go. Okay, I've unburden myself of my thoughts, now, I recommend you to see it and make up your own mind. Within the sad desolation of the film going summer of 2005, there is enough solace within the horrors of War of the Worlds to make you feel you haven't wasted your afternoon.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Intense if not scary.,"By far Spielberg's best effort in a long time. War of the Worlds in a way felt like a cross between his two films that he made in 1993, Jurassic Park and Schindlers List. The aliens with their low, resonating hum and death rays that turns people into dust are as impressive if not more scary than those dinosaurs from the park. As well the feeling of hopelessness I experienced as I viewed the people in this film fight to stay alive was something similar I felt when I viewed those black and white scenes of Germans executing Jews. Plus there were those scenes of horror stricken people fleeing that were similar to what was viewed for real on 9/11. Bottom line, this movie should have you at the edge of your seat.Even though this is science fiction, it is HG Wells who was a remarkable writer who wrote as much for entertainment as he did to express his concern for the progress of the human condition in mondern times. Plus Spielberg has a talent for adding weight to the most frivolous of action scenes. Even though this film had lasers and explosions, you knew this film was not about such things but about humans in times of crisis.I'm not necessarily 100% sold on the films portrayal on the dark nature of the human condition when people are facing such peril. 9/11 showed us people could come together but to be fair we have also seen in such a short amount of time how this nation once again has turned on itself. Plus this film also pits all of humanity against the forces of extinction which is something incalculable or impossible to foresee accurately; therefore, Spielberg's presentation of a dark and raw struggle to stay alive is quite plausible if not realistic.There are some minor questions that any viewer may come up with when watching this film if you get wrapped up in the logic of science fiction. For instance why did it take the aliens a million years to strike and how come they didn't know about bacteria if they are such an advanced species. My answer to those questions are not to answer them but to simply except them as the events of a science fiction plot. Plus there is a bigger point about the bacteria than science has to offer. That point is stated in the wonderful prologue at the end of the movie, ""God in his infinite wisdom..."" Some things in life man can not control and it is at such times of peril and/or devastation that man must reach beyond his own projections of what he can do and cling to hope and faith.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This is a Good Remake...See it for what is is,"My Lord...We go out of our way to hate Tom Cruise because he's fallen in love with a younger, attractive, successful actress and lets the world know about it... We disagree with his religious principals and think he's a nut... We're jealous because he's 40 something, wealthy, and on top of the world... So let's vote this film Worst of 2005...I don't think so...This is an exciting, scary, action-packed film... Cruise's performance as a dead-beat dad who gets it together was not over the top; had he made this film 10 or 15 years ago it no doubt would have been received very differently. This is Science-Fiction/Horror/Fantasy at its best and an original spin on classic material. Orson Welles would have been proud of this effort; Every important point in his original radio play in 1938 is addressed here and a truly stark film showing Man at the mercy of Martians is what we have. Excellent special effects also! Bravo! I suppose Cruise's upcoming Mission Impossible III will be voted Worst of 2006...",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Classic Spielburg Popcorn Flick,"This is the summer popcorn flick you've been waiting for! Overall, I'd have to say the original War of the Worlds is still one of my favorite alien movies but Spielburg proves he can do suspense, horror, and action again in this well made remake. The legendary director also makes sure he has plenty of homages to the original film but there are a few surprising twists as well. He also does something that few other directors do: he has the actors act like real people. Dakota Fanning screams in fear like a ten-year-old would, Tom Cruise is a bit of an asshole jaded father, and Tim Robbins plays a man whose gone over the edge because of the invasion. There are some tense moments and all the classic Spielburg camera shots are present which only make it better. The CGI is also well done on the aliens and I'd say it's worth the price of a movie ticket if you enjoy this type of flick.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Needs tighter directing and a better screenplay,"I was anxiously anticipating the release of this feature. My wife, friends and I walked away today very disappointed. When Steven Spielberg is on his game, he's brilliant. When he lets down his guard and loses focus he runs to excess and banality. The FX are truly superb...murky and terrifying...evoking the mood of the 1898 novel. The screenplay, lackluster dialog, poor editing and Tom Cruise crying out incessantly, ""Rachel, Rachel, Rachel"", however, left our 11:30 A.M. audience restless, silent and apparently bored. The mood coming out of the show was NOT good. Spielberg blew the chance to make a definitive version of the H.G. Wells classic. Why in the world he lets himself get bogged down on these occasions is beyond me. If you're a Wells fan and Spielberg fan then it's worth seeing, if only out of curiosity. Be advised, however, that you may well leave with an empty feeling. Shame on you, Steve....you didn't give us your ""A"" game.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Failed to hold up,"Nice and entertaining first hour. It built up nicely and created an atmosphere of intrigue and suspense. However, there were a couple of extremely annoying characters (son and Tim Robbins) doing insanely stupid things, and one scene (in Tim Robbins basement) near the end that went on far too long. A bit too much of Dakota Fanning screaming, but she did a nice job of piercing my eardrum. Virtual non-existent explanation of the entire ending (which really made the movie a huge downer). It was something about microscopic cells and God, but it was done far too quickly in a voice over narrative by Morgan Freeman and just completely left me and everyone else in the theater with a look of ""what did they just say??"" and ""that's it??"". Nice effects, but the rest of it just didn't hold up, especially for the final 45 minutes or so, which in the end really left me disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Should've won the 3 Oscars it was nominated for!,"I kind of remember seeing in the theater, that was fun! Visually striking and masterful sound extravaganza. War of the Worlds is highly under appreciated, thought provoking and very engaging. Tom Cruise did great, I'm blown away this film even got hate really doesn't deserve it. Steven Spielberg is a legendary filmmaker and always will be no matter what he's artist with great vision.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Chilling and suspenseful,"Overall this is a pretty good movie, it's got a good storyline, some decent special effects and some chilling scenes. The movie is about the protagonist, Tom Cruise, and his two kids who try to survive a mysterious and confusing alien invasion. Although it doesn't have the most original storyline, finding out what the aliens do with the humans they capture is the creepiest and most original scene.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Crazy Night,"While reading ""War of the Worlds"" my outlook on this story was that it was horrifying if you literally put yourself in the characters' shoes. I personally thought that Spielberg's movie was a very visual and imaginative film. The H.G. Wells book of ""War of the Worlds"" has more of a political message. A theme for Spielberg's movie could be ""make the right choices"" and ""don't take life for granted"" because, as the characters experienced, you never can imagine what will happen to you or the ones you love from day to day. For some people a good situation has to turn into a bad one to realize what they had in life. Sometimes it's too late and you can't take back what went on in the past. In the movie Ray's, who is Tom Cruise, whole personality changes.In ""War of the Worlds"" there are plenty of things happening that show human nature. For example, say that someone is in a life or death situation and they are trying to escape; the person isn't going to think about what is the right thing to do or think of the possible consequences. That person is just going to do what they have to, to save themselves and their family no matter how crazy it may be.When I was reading H.G. Wells' book I thought it was really dull and sounded pretty unrealistic to me. Then when I saw the movie my whole perspective changed. I thought it was extremely believable at the beginning because the horrible facial expressions and nerves in people's faces were very realistic! Concerning the characters I thought Robbie was an original character. Throughout the movie Robbie and Ray are interesting because they make major changes throughout the movie. Rachel was brave in my opinion, but she was freaky to me at times. The crazy old man was beyond wacko.I also think other people who saw ""War of the Worlds"" would agree with me on this that the film improved the industry more than you would have thought. At first I thought it would be lame, but I was actually surprised to find out it was really interesting.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the best Sci-Fi movies of the decade,"War of the Worlds has got to be one of my favorite films. The first time I saw this movie I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire run and was in shock at the end. Spielberg once again proves why he is one of the greatest directors of our time. The biggest thing that makes this film amazing is the realism he brings. This film doesn't present a corny alien invasion episode with bad acting or unrealistic situations like Independence Day does, but it puts you right in the characters shoes and does not exaggerate the concept at all. From the angle of the camera (eye level to make it feel like you right there staring at the tripods), to the brilliant cinematography and breathtaking special effects (the opening scene where we see the tripod rise from the ground is astonishing and just freaky), this movie grounds what could have been a very ""out there"" film. The strongest part of the film has to be the performances remarkably done by Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning. Cruise nails the whole dead beat dad who must protect his kids and Dakota's performance is marvelous. Also every moment we see Tim Robbins is pitching perfect. His performance of the man who loses his mind is done flawlessly.One thing that I just can't seem to understand is: Why do some people find this horrible? Because Dakota Fanning screams a lot? Umm..If I was a 10 year old stuck with my estranged father while the whole world is being attacked by aliens and I have no idea where my mother is, I'd be crying like a baby to. A bad plot? Are you kidding? Putting this situation through the eyes of one family yet also getting a fell of how desperate and afraid the world is is brilliant. I think the real reason behind the hate is Tom Cruise overload right when the movie came out. People just got so sick of him that once the movie came out; they just cringed at the sight of him.Despite my ""thumbs up"" for this movie, I did find a few things annoying. My biggest dislike had to be the handling of Robby. Now I totally sympathize and understand Robby. He has more beef with Ray than Rachel since he's older and he feels Ray really doesn't care since he is trying to bring the kids back to mom and fend for himself. The thing I didn't like is he comes of as a prick, even to his little sister! I couldn't believe the part where he tried to hop on one of the military vehicles without his little sister defiantly a WTF moment. And how the hell did Robby manage to survive the military battle and Walk all the way to Boston unscathed? Also I felt as is the second part of the movie got a little boring and I was rather disappointed that the machines were already buriedwould't we have known they were there? Guess alien technology prevented thato well All in all this has got to be one of Spielberg's greatest flicks. Don't listen to the haters, this movie is amazing and astonishing to watch. 8.8/10",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Anti-ID4,"My oh my, I've seen the biggest blockbusters this year and frankly I'm dog tired. So when I sat down for another popcorn flick, it got me worried a bit: 'Do I still love films, or should I just throw in the towel and call it a day?' Right of the bat, I felt relieved. There's still hope and his name is: Spielberg. So what else is new, you might ask. Nothing, would be my answer. Because in the last twelve years (from Jurassic Park and Schindlers List in 1993, threw Saving Private Ryan and A.I.) there's only one big name director who really got better with age. Scorcese and Lynch and all the other 50 plus directors never adapted to the modern times. Spielberg does that and remains classic at the same time.What about this new film of his? It's just unbelievable that such a big movie got such a big heart at the center of it all. War of the Worlds story centers around a struggling man and his two estranged kids. Ray (Cruise in top form) has never really committed himself to be a good father and role-model and his kids dread to visit him on the weekends, which they rarely do. So far WotW is a great drama and I could've watched it for another hour and a half, but the invaders from outer space have different plans. And faster than you can say 'holy crap, there goes my house' the family drives away from there home, fleeing from the nasty aliens.On their drive to Boston a lot of stuff happens to the family that really scared the living daylights out of me. Not because of what you see, but (here it comes Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich) because of what you NOT see. You don't see an alien-vessel every ten seconds or ten minutes for that matter. The whole movie you don't see anything the family doesn't see. That's why you give a rat's ass if something would've happen to them, and that's what makes a great movie. YOU CARE ABOUT THE CHARACTERS!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Seemed Like A Cross Between Independence Day And The Day After Tomorrow.,"War Of The Worlds was a science fiction flick that far exceeded my expectations. To be honest, I had no intentions of seeing this movie. I have never read the book or seen the original. In fact, the only reason I saw the movie was because the large line at the theater piqued my curiosity. That and the fact that I had family in town to see the movie with. I was not disappointed. The beginning of the movie (and at various points throughout), was very similar to The Day After Tomorrow, with all the scenes of storms and people running away en masse. Later, Independence Day came to mind because of the way the humans were trying to figure out how to kill the invading aliens along with other little details. Other movies also came to mind but those were the two major ones.The plot is almost too simple. Earth is attacked by aliens after millions of years of planning. Upon the attack the humans run away and eventually, figure out they have to find a way to overcome the unsurmountable odds or be wiped out completely. One of the major differences between this movie and Independence Day is that ID had many stories and families being tied together by this one story. War of the Worlds focuses on one family, The Ferriers.Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) has just picked up his kids from his divorced wife for the weekend and has no major plans until this unusual storm starts to brew. In what seemed like an instant, all hell broke loose and aliens which were transplanted into these ancient war machines buried under the Earth and started wreaking havoc. That is the movie in a nutshell, folks. The rest of the time The Ferriers are running from their attackers and along the way, getting closer and bridging the gaps that have apparently formed between Ray and his kids. The story is actually a bit more complicated but I do not want to go on too long about it.Dakota Fanning is an amazing little actress to be able to tackle a role like this and to be so convincing. I found Justin Chatwin, the actor who played Robbie Ferrier, to be annoying. Every movie usually has an annoying character and Robbie was it. Also, Tim Robbins stood out as the scared stupid Ogilvy.The special effects, although I have read to the contrary, were top notch. The close-ups of the war machines, especially the eye things, were pretty cool, along with the explosions, etc. Spielberg did a good job of keeping most of the special effects, especially the aliens and their machines, out of the trailers and ruining the surprises. I feel I enjoyed the movie more without knowing anything about it beforehand.This is what The Day After Tomorrow should have been like and would recommend this over ""Day After"" anytime. As I mentioned before, I have not read the book so I am not sure how the ending is meant to be. If the ending of the movie is just being true to the book, then that's cool. If not, it left a little something to be desired. Without adding spoilers, I can not really get into why, but it just seemed a little unfulfilling. However, that is just a small portion of the film that I happened to dislike. Overall, I felt Steven Spielberg did an excellent job and I salute him. 8.5/10",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
War of the Worlds minus the kids equals a lot better movie,"This movie sure did pull me in different directions. I loved the main story, that being the aliens invading and just totally annihilating everything and everyone (very much like Independence Day). The CGI was excellent, you got the full feeling of the destructive power of the aliens and their war machines. There was also a good display of the sheer pandemonium and fear that overcame everybody.Now, as for the underlying story, that being Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) and his relationship with his kids, I didn't care for that at all. It actually dragged the movie down a bit. For the most part ""War of the Worlds"" was a high octane suspenseful movie, except when it was bogged down by Ray and his kids. OK, so Ray has divorced his wife and he doesn't have that great of a relationship with his kids... can't that crap be put to the side in a crisis? I mean it is a crisis situation, even enemies get along a little bit during a crisis. And the boy running off to join the army when things are getting destroyed left and right and his father and sister are trying to reach another destination entirely... what was that about? Like I said, the main story: great... the underlying story: a drag.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Much Better than ""Independence Day""","What can i say the acting of the cast is superior with Dakota Fanning deserving an Oscar for the emotion she portrayed as a frightened child helpless but refusing to give in... Cruise was superb and Robins gave a solid performance, what really impressed me was that it wasn't the Jewish intelligence combined with American technology that won the day as it was in independence day which was completely useless and cliché, but the mere fact of nature was the one that rejected the new breed of invaders, which gave the personification of Gaya the spirit of the earth like ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"" was very impressive and unique in its own way... Very rushed ending which spoiled the whole experience... better job next time Spielberg... great homage to the novel otherwise. enjoyable movie overall 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great First Half,It was a really well done first half of the movie. It was engaging and the entire initial fallout was entertaining and exciting.

Mixed Opinions,"In my opinion parts of the movie ""War of the Worlds,"" had some scenes that were believable while others weren't. The family relations of the movie were realistic between the father Ray and his kids, Rachel and Robbie. Another realization in the movie was the human nature of all of the people in the world. If something even remotely close to this attack happened, there would definitely be a mob mentality. People don't know any other way to react because they definitely wont remain calm.As far as the Martians go, they were the most unbelievable part of the movie. The way that the Martians arrived on the earth is just so illogical. If you think about it for real, what are the real chances of anything with Martians ever actually happening? Really there is no real chance.The theme that I got from Spielberg's movie was ""Don't take life for granted."" An example of this theme would be that they realized that anything could happen at anytime and not to overlook your life.I also thought that Spielberg did a good job in making ""War of the World's"" for pure entertainment rather than while the book was based for a political statement. Spielberg didn't need to follow the political statement of the book because, watching a movie you want to enjoy it for entertainment. It is more relaxing to have a movie for entertainment and a book that has a real statement to make.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
War of the Worlds,"Always a bit of trepidation going to see a remake of a major movie - The original was quite good (for its time).I think part of it is the ""I know what's going to happen"" feeling and so I approached War of the Worlds in this light.However I was entirely delighted with the movie, the updated story line, and the excellent special effects. I think it totally blows away the other big Sci Fi remake of 2005 (King Kong) in no small part because of the ""reality"" feel to it. Kong was a fantasy pure and simple where as Worlds felt as if you were there with Tom Cruise about to get zapped with the other citizens.The children's performances were excellent and Tom did a suburb job of it.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Too Much Hatred,"When I walked out in the cinemas just watching the remake from the 1953 version, I was exceptionally pleased. War of the Worlds is a thrilling dark action/adventure starring Tom Cruise about a supernatural piece of high destructive equipment decides to take over the planet earth, leading to a rampage of survival, war and justice. It's not just all war and violence, it tackles and illustrates deep emotions such as trust and family. Family is a big important issue in this movie as Tom Cruise's character has a weak relationship with his daughter and son, through-out the movie you see their relationship develop either for the good or worst. Spielberg's War of the Worlds has a servilely weak rating on IMDb, and receives far too much hate and hatred, it's a break-through for Spielberg and a highly entertaining piece of work. Each Spielberg and supernatural fan should give this a watch despite it's general criticism and shown rating. To me, War of the Worlds is a strong remake from a strong director.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Has Very Strong Aspects but Falls a Bit Short,"Even when I first saw this film as a kid, I noticed the invocation of 9/11 imagery to help show the horror that the characters are facing. In a country no longer experiencing the bliss of 90s excess, films like this are more in touch with the times they come out in than their comparatively tone deaf counterparts of the 90s. This, however, has already been said before, but it's still one of my favorite aspects of this film.Ultimately where this version of War of the Worlds is at its strongest is when we follow the main characters and experience this attempted extermination of humans by the alien invaders. This survival aspect of the film helps to make it feel much more grounded and realistic than if the characters decided to become fighter jet pilots or something and blow all the tripods up. Instead, the characters are powerless, unable to influence the larger scale of the situation at all, let alone their own personal ones.The danger with a film like this is that it is difficult for it to not eventually become repetitive. On top of that, there is also a danger that the thing that you end up doing to differentiate from the formula also can end up being the weakest part of the film. The latter happens to be true for this film, unfortunately. The survival horror aspect of the first two thirds of this film are really well-done, but then, as many already know, it falters a bit in the final third. The pacing in this part of the film is strange and is mostly quite forgettable. The sequence where the tripod probe follows the characters around in the basement is a recreation of the raptor scene in Jurassic Park except much weaker, and aside from that and the scene where Dakota Fanning's character sings Hushabye Mountain to herself mostly because I'm a fan of Chitty Chitty Bang bang but...This version of War of the Worlds, as of writing this- before having seen the BBC series, I believe is, at the very least, the definitive modern cinematic adaptation of the story to date. Yes, this film is far from perfect, hence the 6/10 rating, but I still think there is enough here to give an enjoyable experience. Maybe not a family movie night-kind of movie since it is pretty dark despite it being a Spielberg film, but good for a movie date or for anyone interested in exploring some of the deeper cuts in Spielberg's filmography.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great Homage to the Novel,"I thought they did a great job paying homage to the novel while keeping a modern US take on the British 1800s time period. The detail between the two was impressive and even though they decided to make the main character a family man they still were able to incorporate the same key moments. Even Tim Robbins's character near the end paid homage to the curate who freaked out and couldn't keep his mouth shut. My main negative against this was the kids, especially Robbie going from the rebellious teen to a boy dead set on being a hero. There wasn't enough character development to explain why he became how he became. Kids are young and naive, but it was a weird transition. For a 2005 film, I was impressed with the visuals, and they seem to hold up today in my opinion. It's not Spielberg's best film but it was still enjoyable. 3.5/5 stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""War of the Worlds"" is the BOMB","After watching Stephen Spielberg's rendition of the ""War of the Worlds"" I was actually really impressed with the movie. The main reason that I like this movie is because it stays true to its original plot as H.G. Wells intended it to be, and also to the 1953 Haskins rendition of ""War of the Worlds"". For me I found the movie quite believable in a way because here's an average family, with their average problems but they have to deal with a horrific situation not just them the whole world that the aliens came to earth and are now trying to conquer it and eliminate all of humanity. I also thought the design for the machines and the aliens themselves were pretty amazing. The machines having 3 legs, I thought was cool because it's kind of like it's out of this world, and how everything on earth either has 2 or 4 legs and wherever they were from had an odd number, and it just adds to the terror of these machines. I also liked the aliens with their 3 legs matching there machines, or tri-pods if you will, walking and acting like them in a way. Coming off a good note I wanted to and express some things I really didn't like about the movie. The one thing I really didn't like about the movie was Susan (Dakota Fanning) was that I think she was a little over dramatic during the whole movie. Also I thought that it was a little unlikely that a family could run so many miles and the whole time they are going in the same direction that the tri-pods were going. Overall I thought that the movie ""War of the Worlds"" was a very plausible and interesting movie and I never got bored while watching it. I would recommend this movie to anybody who watches movies for the thrill and adrenaline rush of sci-fi alien movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
OK remake,"Tom Cruise stars as Ray, a dock worker in NYC who is divorced from his wife and has 2 kids, Rachel (Dakota Fanning) and Robbie (Justin Chatwin). Ray gets custody of the kids over the weekend while his ex and her husband are off to Boston. Then out of nowhere, the aliens start attacking.Cruise does a decent acting job. I found Dakota Fanning great, though her role was limited to mostly crying, screaming, and looking scared, which she did very well. Robbie is depicted as a son who thinks his father let them down and doesn't care about the kids, which seems to be mostly right. Cruise is playing a complex role trying to show the kids he can be caring, while realizing he's been somewhat of an irresponsible dad to them too.The movie is all about CGI after that. Endless chases across the landscape, unruly mobs, and the tripod monster ships. The movie gets kind of tedious and slow, especially when they hide out in a basement with Tim Robbins. Spielberg tries to keep up the tension as much as possible, and that mostly succeeds.Still, you already know the story. So you know how it's going to go. Therefore, really not much of a plot, little room for the characters to grow much, with an interesting twist around blood. It was an OK movie, so I give it an OK score 6/10. Cruise has been better, and so has Spielberg. Even the animators in the special features, while trying to make it seem like they were excited, also seemed to be going thru the motions while paying appropriate tribute to Spielberg. That pretty much summed up this OK movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"If this movie were a meal, it would be a very satisfying prime beef steak with a dollop of unnecessary cheese.","However it must be said that the majority of the meal is so perfectly cooked that you're able to swallow the cheese without much trouble.Tom Cruise was good enough that even my fiancé, not normally a fan, was impressed... and despite some misgivings as the lights dimmed at the start, once the action started, not once did I think of Katie Holmes - I was simply too swept up in the action to think about anything other than what was on the screen. But no matter how good a job Tom did, it has to be said that Dakota Fanning blew everyone else away. And not in the same way Tom was upstaged by the gorgeous little boy in Jerry Maguire through sheer 'awww' factor, Dakota is both cute and one of the most talented actresses I've ever seen.The special effects were amazing, (the first lightning storm was the PERFECT way to get the audience on the edge of their seats, the rest of the movie made sure we stayed there) the thrills were non-stop and executed brilliantly - I nearly broke my fiancé's arm during one particularly nerve-wracking scene - and whilst some of the characters were inevitable clichés - the rebellious teenage son, for example - the story evolved at a fast enough pace that you didn't have time to get irritated by them.I thought the ending came a bit suddenly and with perhaps not quite enough explanation but overall I really enjoyed this movie - and I'm not usually a fan of alien blockbusters. I just want to know one thing - HOW COME THAT GUY'S CAMCORDER WAS WORKING???!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Sound and fury,"""War of the Worlds"" is largely a reversion to a Fifties Sci-Fi scare movie, with far more splendid and real-looking effects but less of a world-view or point than those earlier things had. These silly pod creatures, with their various pod-offspring or excrescences, that all wither away like the aliens at the end of Shyamalan's ""Signs"" -- allergic to terrestrial microorganisms instead of H2O -- if they're such superior beings, how come they have to go out and mow down humans one by one? To scare us in an old-fashioned way, must be the answer. But there is no time allowed to speculate as to their purpose (other than extermination) since all Tom Cruise and his two children do is flee -- to mama. But to get back to the creatures on vast spindly stilts: if they're so menacing and powerful, why can't they find three people in a basement (where Tim Robbins helps provide the movie's most tedious minutes)? The screenplay of War of the Worlds is contemptible; but the effects, especially in the big crowd scenes and when some New Jersey streets are crumbling, are terrific. Some of the simple desperation of cheaper, but more human end-of-the-world movies like Michael Haneke's recent ""Hour of the Wolf"" is evoked as Cruise's son Robbie (Justin Chatwin) and daughter Rachel (Dakota Fanning) are almost whisked away in a darkened field and a crowd struggles to get onto a ferryboat. The end is as lame as that of Roland Emmerich's ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" whose trajectory it much resembles: going home to mama resolves the problem of a wrecked planet.Spielberg has always used children, sometimes in heartrending, sometimes in purely manipulative ways. This time he begins with a divorced couple with shared custody and a contrast of class and attitude. Ray Ferrier (Cruise) is a surly construction worker, macho and uncooperative on the job, unable to bother with his little girl and young teenage son who're deposited with him on weekends by his ex-wife Mary Ann (Miranda Otto), who's off to her parents' in Boston. The world erupts when freak electric storms herald an invasion of monsters out of the earth which destroy much -- but not all! -- around the holes they emerge from with horrific blasts of sound. So Ray and the two kids don't have to decide how to spend the weekend. They go on an expedition -- in (wonder of wonders) the only car for miles around that runs after the storms (it was the solenoids--smart Ray to think of it!) -- first to the big McMansion Mary Ann occupies with her new husband in a posh suburb, then when that turns into a war zone over night, on to grandpa and grandma's place in Boston. Heroically inclined Robbie runs off in a field -- presumably to join the army at fourteen -- but is at the grandparents when Ray gets there: wonder of wonders! Little Rachel (perhaps the braver of the two) stays to weather Tim Robbins' dialogue in that dank basement.Tom Cruise hasn't had a good role other than ""Collateral's"" nihilist hit man -- which was a very good one, in a beautifully crafted movie -- in years. In ""War of the Worlds,"" he's been accused of sentimentalizing his character, playing for our sympathy when he began as a prick. This is a misreading of the screenplay, which has this quite natural progress toward caring for his kids built into it; this isn't Cruise's betrayal of his role. He's okay, but he has nothing to deal with. He hardly deserves credit for not hamming it up. It's not a sure thing that he knows how to ham it up. Dakota Fanning is excellent. She takes us through a lot of emotions the action calls for that the movie would lack without her. The kitsch pseudo-ecological thinking behind ""The Day After Tomorrow"" looks like Newton and Einstein next to Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds.""Still, Spielberg provides entertainment and some thrills with his awesome effects, not so much the monsters and their reaching tentacles and insect bodies and faces, which we have seen before, as with the cracking up of streets and falling down of buildings, and some splendid devastation, notably the wreckage of houses and cars and airplanes outside Miranda Otto's McMansion, and for the manipulation of crowds, especially around the ferry landing.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Lightning Strikes Twice,"Get ready for a wild ride with the Steven Spielberg ""DreamWorks"" production team, in this high quality revision of H.G. Wells' ""War of the Worlds"". For this invasion, the story has been updated to focus on the family changes which have become most dominant over the decades since the successful 1953 version. So, the central figure, Tom Cruise (as Ray Ferrier), is not a doctor, but a more ordinary New Jersey dock worker. And, the lead character played by Mr. Cruise is made much more interesting by the fact that he is a divorced man, who is somewhat estranged from his children . Instead of the expected ""hot romance"", you have the drama unfolding around the bonding of Cruise and his children.Of course, a lot of disbelief suspension is required, especially in this type of film; but, the updated situation is refreshing, and believable. When the film begins, Cruise's ex-wife drops off the couple's two children while she goes off to spend some time with her new husband, and parents, in Boston. The children are played well, by Justin Chatwin (Robbie Ferrier) and Dakota Fanning (Rachel Ferrier). There is a point (foreshadowed twice) where Mr. Chatwin leaves the action; it seems like a flaw in the storytelling; but, it does work out quite well. The ""son"" is replaced by Tim Robbins (as Harlan Ogilvy), in some scenes which would not have worked with the original threesome.Cruise deserves some particular praise, for his performance. He is especially good after suffering a loss, then taking refuge in Mr. Robbins' basement; observe his fight to overcome madness, and protect his daughter, in the bowels of the Earth. Cruise's tearful rendition of ""Little Deuce Coupe"" is one of the film's most memorable moments; and, it involves no observable ""special effect"". The alien ""special effects"" are fantastic. John Williams is outstanding. Reserving comments on minor difficulties which would reveal too much; (except, the narration was unnecessary); the ""War of the Worlds"" is excellent entertainment.******** War of the Worlds (6/13/05) Steven Spielberg ~ Tom Cruise, Dakota Fanning, Justin Chatwin, Tim Robbins",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Disturbing, but good","When I was watching this movie, I had two feelings: panic and fear. The panic came from being a mom. I felt this once Cruise and his family crashed the minivan and were mobbed by the crowd. Once they got in and Dakota couldn't get out, that's when I felt panic. I couldn't imagine my daughter being stuck in a situation like that and me not being able to help her. I also felt panic at how the people responded in the movie. It showed what real savages humans can be in desperate situations. The men shooting each other to steal the minivan were insane, where exactly were they going? Put people in a group with strangers who are scared and hungry and pandemonium breaks out. I also felt fear. It was really scary to watch the tripods break out of the ground and start vaporizing people. What was even scarier was a thought on a slightly higher scale. We humans (especially Americans) think we are invincible. Yet even with all our weapons, technology and supposed ""superiority"", these aliens were systematically eliminating the human race as easily as we step on ants. I really hope that if there are other species in this universe, they skip our pathetic planet. We are, to quote Star Trek TNG, ""a savage child race."" We can't even get along with each other, much less a different species. But, I digress. This was a movie with great special effects. Though I never saw the original, I thought I was very powerful and Dakota Fanning is amazing. She is as talented as she is cute. She deserves the most credit in the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Spielberg makes a good movie, but not great one.  No excuses for him.","War of the Worlds contains enough suspense and good acting that this movie should be hailed as a ""good"" movie. The ""tri-pods"" are effective and scary, and the haunting attack scenes are well done. But what went wrong in this film ? I have a list:1. The ending. Bravo for staying true to the original film / H.G. Wells, but it seemed rushed. Take your time, this is a perfect time for Spielberg to follow Wells version, and show the aliens attempt to communicate. Show their downfall in force. Instead we just get a glimpse with some commentary by Morgan Freeman. And also the ""happy"" reunion with the family. I could of forgiven this ending , had he actually took his time with the ending. He didn't.2. Yes, this movie does show the ""panicked"" view of the attack. Nobody knows anything, nothing is really explained. But the more you think about the aliens and what they did, the harder it is too swallow. They travel thru lighting rods to their underground ships.....hmmmmm. Where did this lightning travel from ? How come nobody happened to stumble upon these ships ? Had this movie been based in the 1800's, I would believe, but today ..........naaahhh. We have satellites and machines too now.2b: The overall invasion. In the original, they travel from space, comets , and wreak havoc. We assume this is their first visit. In this one, we have to assume they have been underground for thousands if not millions of years. Don't you think they would of attacked before man advanced so much ? We can fight back now. Also, didn't they test the air ? They have this complex eco-system with red vines. Talk about bad research on their part. Killed by germs.A better ending would of been : The aliens die of germs, but germs released by us. We actually did find the ships and were preparing for this day. Big government conspiracy cover up. It would stay true to the original, with a major dose of reality and ""Area 51"" feel to it. The government though, of course, was not aware of the alien's true power.Overall, it's worth seeing and Spielberg still knows how to make a great movie. It's scary, creepy, suspenseful and memorable. But Spielberg did seem to get lazy on us. What could of been a classic, was only above average. Bravo to some directors, but for Spielberg. No excuses for him. We expect more.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One Masterful Sequence: The Hudson Ferry Scene,"The central sequence in the film, the Hudson Ferry sequence is the one moment in which Spielberg achieves real and memorable horror. The crush of people, the hysteria and violence culminate in the beautifully realized capsizing of the ferry. At the end of this scene we are shown for the first time an even more monstrous side of the invaders. They are snatching people up into the machines.... and then we see torn clothing wafting down. There are a lot of expert touches to enhance the horror and dread. My favorite is when the little girl notices fleeing birds and something 'funny among the the trees on the other bank. It is a moment of stillness before the climax. Spielberg deserves kudos for this one scene even if you don't like the entire movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This didn't seem like a Spielberg movie....,"....in that it was too crap. OK, first off the special effects were amazing. BUt I always thought Spielberg had movies with good stories that brought something original to the party. WOTW seemed like it could have been done by any action movie director - Michael Bay maybe :-SOK not much time but things that got to me:1) If the aliens coveted our planet for a million years, why didn't they just take over before humans existed? Even cavemen could have been exterminated with a pointy stick. 2) How come Tom Cruise ALWAYS seemed to be the prime target for the tripods etc? Out of all the thousands of people crowding the streets...BUt despite this he always managed to avoid their superior technology and weapons. 3)On that note, if it was ""an extermination"" why not bomb us or gas us or release a selective plague upon us? Instead, the MASSSIVE tripods weapon of choice was laser weapons to take humans out one at a time?!?!!? 4) Also, with their superior technology how come they had no infrared, x-ray etc sensors. All that stuff is common on our own war machines. It would make it a lot less simple to ""hide behind a mirror"". 5) OK, why WAS Tom Cruises car the ONLY one working. He was lucky?....Hmmm, more story please. 6) The aliens used human blood to fertilise their red weed? This sounds too B-grade to be expanded upon...Sufice to say, with all the species to choose from on earth, are we REALLY the best candidate for fertiliser from an economic point of view?. Ahem - think about The Matrix on his point too... 7) OK, I know people are dumb, but how many of you guys would have stood around while that first tripod emerged? Especially when, like Tom Cruise, every crack in the ground and falling object seemed to have his name all over it?OK that's all can think of on my short lunch break.

Some people seem to be confused,"It looks like this is dividing opinions sharply. I'm coming down very heavily on the ""sci-fi classic"" side of the argument, indeed I think it's better than Close Encounters. It's one of those films where you come out of the theatre and want to get straight back in again, like a filmic roller coaster.I just DO NOT UNDERSTAND how people can come out of the theatre saying bad things about it. No plot?!!! You have got to be kidding! I wonder what these people actually want from their movies.Tom Cruise's acting is the best it's ever been and the two young co-stars are both outstanding. The effects are awesome except for one early scene which really does look like a two-foot high model from a B-movie. The tension is maintained throughout and - rare for Spielberg - there's not too much mush. One of our national papers in Britain has called it the best sci-fi of all time. It's got to be close.

Best Summer Movie-Period,"The first time I saw this film was at an advanced screening. I came out thinking to myself ""That was certainly different to what I had in mind"". Overall I thought it was quite good, with moments of excellence, but I didn't really believe that it was one of Spielbergs best.I saw it again last night at the midnight premiere and obviously knew what kind of film to expect this time. Upon second viewing I came out a blabbering mess! I LOVED it.This is the one we've been waiting for, Spielberg fans rejoice! This film is a mixed bag of goodies! From the emergence of the first tripod we are catapulted in to intense action. We follow Ray (Cruise) and his family through the narrow escape from the city to the nail biting suspense of the Ferry scene ( you just know somethings going to happen!). And then just when you think things are going to jump up a notch to a full fledged battle between Tripod and Humans, Spielberg works his magic and brings us in to the dank, dark basement of Ogilvy (Robbins). The action jumps down a notch while the suspense sky rockets! A very tense scene in the basement pits Ray and Co. against a wandering Alien camera probe, made 100 times more suspenseful by John Williams' chilling, unfriendly score. For those Jurassic Park nuts (like me), your going to LOVE this scene! (Think ""Raptors in the kitchen"" scene from JP!).I would love to write more, but words simply cannot explain the feeling of absolute desperation and loss you will get from this film. Just go and see it! Ladies and gentlemen, this is NOT another ""Effects movie"", this is a Steven Spielberg film. Better still: A Steven Spielberg ALIEN INVASION movie! What more could you ask for? I'm giving it 9 out of 10 only because it didn't have the ""wow, look at those special effects!"" factor that Jurassic Park did when it premiered in '93.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mediocre despite over the top special effects.,"I saw this flick when it first opened and prior to that I was very much looking forward to seeing it from the previews. To my disappointment, it did not live up to the hype. There are numerous things that went awry with this film.First and foremost; is the selection of Tom Cruise as the lead character. With all the media attention he's been getting lately and his surreal personality is just very distracting. As an audience, I can not separate the actor from the character he's playing  Ray Ferrier. But then again, that's Tom Cruise who is always ""big"" whenever he acts. It seemed as though being 'too big' is the only range he knows best as far as acting is concern. He seemed like he is always constipated whenever he acts (take for instance Jerry MgGuire, A Few Good Men). His fellow actors on the other hand; Dakota Fanning (played his daughter Rachel), Justin Chatwin (played his rebellious son Robbie), were the anti-thesis of Cruise. Both young actors were convincing in the film. As an audience you react to their characters and hate them for the most parts. Such is an evidence of solid acting, you do not see the actor but you see the character they play.Second, the plot is very simple. A man's struggle to keep his family alive as they travel from point A to point B and in the background is the alien invasion. Nothing is wrong with that plot, in fact it is quite commendable to an extent. It illustrates what men (people in general) would do I the midst of a crisis  fight or flight or both. Fight to a point of killing an innocent man to flee to save his family from a conflict as depicted in a few notable scenes in the film. The drama that the film makers attempted to convey surrounding some of the scenes would have been more convincing if the antagonist were real  i.e. the Nazi, the rogue tribal militia etc. But the aliens? Come on! I guess what I'm trying to say is, keep the drama out of films of this type. It just did not worked.Third, the dialog is detached to what is going on in the film. Call me a realist, but it's not the kind of dialog you would hear victims of tsunami would be uttering. For instance:Ray Ferrier: ""They're not from around here"". Robbie Ferrier: ""You mean they're, like, from Europe?"" Ray Ferrier: ""No, Robbie, they're not from Europe.""What is up with that? It's lacking urgency and fear considering it's allegedly the end of the world.Despite the flaws, I still managed to find the movie entertaining albeit mediocre. It has great special effects as always but even that becomes a norm these days. It's a definite rental.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Steven Spielberg brought us a flawed but visual masterpiece, an unforgettable sci-fi film","War of the Worlds is directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Josh Friedman and David Koepp, the film is a remake of the 1953 film of the same name, but it's based on the 1898 novel by H. G. Wells. I have sadly not read the novel but I've heard a lot of good things about this film. With Steven Spielberg behind the camera and director chair, what could go wrong? Not much did, but it's not a perfect and flawless film. But I fully understand why it grossed over $603 million worldwide and why it became the fourth most successful film of 2005. It's a film everyone can like, young like old. For a sci-fi film of an alien attack, most films strive for entertainment more than realism and logic, Steven Spielberg made War of the Worlds hyper-realistic and thank you for that. It made this into a more memorable film and an unforgettable experience.An alien invasion threatens the future of humanity. The catastrophic nightmare is depicted through the eyes of one American family fighting for survival. That's the premise of the film and the Ferrier family is played and led by Tom Cruise who are giving a terrific performance as Ray Ferrier. The cast has Dakota Fanning in her breakout role as Rachel Ferrier and her performance is actually quite great and believable, Justin Chatwin as Robbie Ferrier and Miranda Otto as Mary Ann Ferrier. There's also Tim Robbins and Rick Gonzalez in supporting roles, with narration by Morgan Freeman. Overall, the acting is pretty great, most are fantastic.Long time collaborators came back to work with Steven Spielberg. Janusz Kaminski who served as cinematographer and did one hell of a good job, Michael Kahn who edited the film and of course the musical genius John Williams who did the musical score. All three of them do some truly breathtaking and superb work in this film, making War of the Worlds into a fine piece of film for casual viewers and cinephiles. The sound editing is also quite brilliant. What's the reason so many people went to see this film with it grossing over 800 million dollars. The two big reasons are of course Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise, but the third being the visual effects which Industrial Light & Magic was the main special effects company for the movie. Spielberg said, ""This is the first film I really tackled using the computer to animate all the storyboards."" He decided to employ the technique extensively after a visit to his friend George Lucas. In order to keep the realism, the usage of computer-generated imagery shots and bluescreen was limited, with most of the digital effects being blended with miniature and live-action footage. War of the World should have won the award for best visual effects. The writing is actually quite great, ending felt a little bit lackluster though. But the action sequences and characters were great, Spielberg's direction was phenomenal and well he created another visual masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
E.T. Phones Back ... With a Vengeance!,"Being a gigantic fan-boy of 50's nostalgia and particularly the cinematic Sci-Fi milestones this decade brought forward, I was rather reluctant at first to check out the new and improved (read: massively budgeted) version of HG. Wells' legendary novel ""The War of the Worlds"". The 1953 original is a brilliant film and, in my humble opinion, still perfectly able to petrify any type of viewer, so  like most nowadays remakes  it would be a completely redundant film only intended for young kids that refuse to watch movies in black & white. Most of all I was concerned that the emphasis would lay too much on the expensive computer-engineered effects and the good looks of star Tom Cruise, whereas the original primarily revolved on the portrayal of mass hysteria and growing desperation amongst the earthly population. Well I love to be proved wrong; especially when it comes to prejudices I have towards Sci-Fi and horror movies. Steven Spielberg handles the material very well and doesn't lose the grip on suspense in favor of sentiment, which admittedly I feared would happen. Tom Cruise doesn't depict a savior type of character, but an average kind of guy with several issues of his own, who now suddenly becomes forced to forget everything and save his children. Just when his ex-wife requests Ray to look after their kids, superior creatures from other unspecified worlds attack the entire planet. It starts with a long series of eerie lightening and all electrical and motored equipment breaks down. Subsequently gigantic and super hi-tech advanced tripod monsters emerge from the ground  like they've been buried there since ancient times  and promptly begin with the extermination of the entire human race. Their weapons literally pulverize people, their scouting machinery is a gazillion times more sophisticated than any earthly defense mechanism and in less than a couple of days our planet turns into a wasteland. For the first time his life, Ray will have to take responsibility and escort his estranged offspring to Boston. Steven Spielberg already had quite a bit of experience with alien-movies, but you can hardly compare the concept of ""War of the World"" with either ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" or ""E.T."" This is first and foremost a haunting tale about invasion and destruction, and there's very little room for sentimental sub plots. The inevitable storyline of Ray slowly bonding with his initially hesitant children is the only emotional content, and actually quite bearable (the forced happy-ending not included). Several sequences are downright fantastic, like all the ones with Tim Robbins (depicting some sort of paranoid hermit) and indescribably spectacular to behold, like the ones where the immense tripods go on their relentless rampages (destroying churches, capsizing ferry boats, etc). Needless to say the use of special and digital effects are as good as flawless. The alien creatures' design is perhaps a bit cheesy, but what the hell, at least their tripods and scouting equipment are breath taking. You could go on and on reviewing the little shortcomings and/or analyzing the hidden symbolism, but it all simply comes down to the fact that ""War of the Worlds"" is an efficiently made and highly enjoyable popcorn blockbuster movie.

Spielberg on good form,"If you like 'this sort of thing' then you will like this all bells-and-whistles Spielberg revamping of War of the Worlds. Spielberg's films tend to avoid deep meanings: they are true escapist story-telling. It's what he does best, and here he is well accompanied by Tom Cruise, an excellent actor who's calling is similarly 'unambitious' but who's reach doesn't exceed his grasp.Most people will know the basic story, so it needs an expert storyteller to make it fresh. It's set in the USA, in the present, and impressed me for its restrained use of special effects given the theme of invaders from outer space sterilising the earth of human 'bacteria' in order to settle. It starts off slowly enough, very laid back as we are eased into the characters of Ray Ferrier (Cruise), his estranged wife Mary Ann (Miranda Otto) and their two children, Justin and Dakota. The build up and invasion is almost secondary to the sense of rising panic, fear and ensuing desperation.Spielberg successfully manages the task of creating largescale film with a disaster convincingly global (see it on as large a screen as possible!) and there are plenty of opportunities for simple acts of heroism (adolescent Justin trying to save passengers on ferry), caring (a father doing his utmost for his rebellious children, even as he's scared out of his wits himself) and cutesiness (the young Dakota making every father's heart melt  and the acting of Dakota Fanning is one of the great child performances of the year).The actual aliens and their ships are impressive enough, but not ostentatiously so. Two thirds of the way through, Tim Robbins makes an appearance as an ambulance worker and his screen charisma makes an excellent balance to Cruise who could otherwise be too all-engulfing.Spielberg manages to wind it all up before it gets boring (running time is mercifully under two hours). As a fun ride, War of the Worlds is slick, thrilling, and worth every minute  but has little substance once you've left the theatre.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"War of The Worlds : Good, Not Great","Spielberg's War of the Worlds (2005) was a very unsatisfactory film. It lacks a sense of reality, in that the Martian invasion from underground just doesn't seem plausible. Though it was a good concept as an alternative to the cliché ""Martians from Mars"", the enormous, sky-scraping tripods just don't seem to logically be able to come from under ground. The digital effects used look gorgeous and do a fantastic job in making the actual invasion and carnage of the Martians look realistic, and believable. Their wreckage is absolutely brutal, but you can't look away. As far as the plot goes, Spielberg did a moderate job at keeping it flowing, but the plot line hardly follows H.G. Wells' The War of the Worlds novel. The action in the movie was particularly enjoyable, in that it kept viewers wanting to see more. It was a mystery, developed at the beginning of the movie, and elegantly closed at the end. Small details found in the film, such as the birds, kept the viewer aching to know more, keeping their attention through the constant interaction between characters allowed the mystery to be unraveled. The ending was well developed through the storyline, and kept you watching until the last minute, actually wanting to know how mankind would once again be saved. Tom Cruise did a great job portraying Ray, the protagonist of the film. His character does a good job developing throughout the film. Dakota Fanning, on the other hand, is an annoyance for the entire film. Her sub-par acting and fake emotions are less than entertaining, and constant screams really turn a viewer off. The aliens were absolutely fantastic. They looked great and the audience can really feel their authenticity through their human-like characteristic. They were curious, intelligent, and life-like. Overall, the film rates a 7.2. It is one that should be seen by any sci-fi enthusiast, and is entertaining to the general audience. But it is certainly not to die for. It is worth renting, but the DVD is definitely not a buy.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Delivers several quick punches rather than one, more drawn out experience but the hits hit the mark","If War of the Worlds proves anything, it is that Steven Spielberg knows how to master the situation of placing ordinary and innocent characters into a scenario of great, fantastical nature and allowing things and events to play out in a rapid and exciting manner. This is the sort of film that is chalk and cheese for Spielberg, something he mastered in films like Jurassic Park where innocents in the form of children and every-day people were placed into a predicament they could not possibly comprehend they'd ever face (that event being hunted by dinosaurs). He also did it on a much, much larger scale in Saving Private Ryan where American troops were in Europe; were alienated and pushed to extreme measures after questioning with one another the very reason several of them were being risked for one.Like those two films, War of the Worlds gives us three things: firstly an expansive and inescapable canvas on which to allow the adventure to play out. Secondly, unspectacular characters dropped into a predicament that forces them to become somewhat spectacular even if it is to merely survive. And thirdly, an enemy that is either mysterious or unseen for most of the time but most certainly hostile and one that the protagonists will have a hard time fighting since they are either hopelessly outnumbered or outgunned. War of the Worlds is hardly a crowning achievement but for Spielberg, it's the sort of film he relishes making  the sort of film that does not need advanced characters or a stupendous story but has enough within the premise to etch two or three dramatic scenes out of.In terms of extra-terrestrials, the Martians in War of the World are certainly the most unfriendly in Spielberg's collection. The idea that they have watched on for centuries immediately establishes some sort of superiority in the sense they must be highly advanced to even see our planet, let alone observe it  and what do we have to show? The Hubble Telescope, is what. So the drive for the antagonism is weak in the sense what it boils down to is mere inter species envy that films like Se7en taught us is not a good thing to be harbouring. Another thing I noticed was that their recall klaxon sounds oddly like the opening two beats of the Halloween III: Season of the Witch theme tune.But rather than a gripping story, War of the Worlds gives us a nice, reliable and somewhat effective cause and effect fuelled passage. On the whole, it works and the film glides effortlessly between locations and situations, all of which revolve around desperation as a group struggle to take a car; the chance arises to hide in a basement and then what to do once down there. The hero, played by Tom Cruise, is Ray Ferrier; a man established to be the sort of person we are not supposed to like what with his outlandish attitude and ignoring of his children. This is a test of survival but looking deeper it is clearly a metaphorical journey for Ray to undertake so that he may prove his worth as a father and as a fatherly figure in times of crisis. There is no coincidence Ray is struggling with a divorce and is established in the manner he is, nor is it by chance he has priority of his kids when the initial incident occurs.So apart from most things including being a damn good ride, War of the Worlds is a journey of survival but also self-discovery and proof that an egotistical American male can balance both his ego and his fatherly figure at once. The film is Independence Day and Mars Attacks! done right; it is both these films with heart and is one that does not rely on the mere visualisation of exploding buildings and destroyed pieces of iconography to get across thrills. War of the Worlds is the sort of film that has a fierce battle going on between tanks and the aliens but refuses to either pan or cut to it and instead remains on Ray and his son go through a short but required conversation about masculinity and 'where one belongs'. For son Robbie (Chatwin) it is the battlefield, for father Ray it is on the run with daughter Rachel (Fanning) acting as the protector.On one hand this is a post-9/11 blockbuster that was made well after 9/11 and the following invasion as the United States struggles to a; come to terms with an attack of this magnitude from the outside and b; cannot seem to finish off the enemy once they are confronted. There are some annoying obligatory scenes and the logic falls apart once or twice towards the end, the disappointing dénouement being one of them, but War of the Worlds' study is all about getting to that point rather than what happens after it's arrived there. Satisfying and tense on one or two occasions, War of the Worlds does make the grade.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
They Came from Someplace Else,"Although superficially closer to Wells's original, it actually more closely resembles Daphne du Maurier's claustrophobic short story 'The Birds' in it's worm's-eye-view of a cataclysm. All the main action takes place offscreen (presciently the first stirrings are reported in the Ukraine), the most egregious example being the aerial engagement between the Air Force and the Martians; while 90% of the time the camera shows us Tom Cruise being shocked by what he sees rather than what is doing the shocking. A pretty poor substitute.The 1953 version may have been a travesty of Wells's novel but you enjoy a far better vantage point from which view the destruction - in Technicolor - the Martian war machines are far more elegantly designed.

Spielberg out does Independence Day with this superior film!,"2005's War of the Worlds, Steven Spielberg's second collaboration with Tom Cruise and the remake of the classic novel was a smash box office hit.Outdoing Roland Emmerich's trashy 1996 alien invasion film, Independence Day, by every step stars Tom Cruise in a surprisingly effective role as a selfish and divorced dock worker with two kids in tow for a weekend that none of them will ever forget.What starts off as a routine weekend with the kids becomes all all out force for survival as alien invaders, looking to destroy all of mankind pushes, Ray Ferrier, (Tom Cruise) to the brink of insanity.Now I am one of the first people to admit that I personally cannot stand Mr. Cruise and some of his recently irritating antics, from his couch jumping, to his undying love for then girlfriend, (a much younger Katie Holmes, who is young enough to be his own daughter) and, his much publicized debate with Matt Lauer on the effects of psychiatric medication.However, if you can put Mr Cruise's obviously inflated ego aside, you'll see one of the most effective performances as a man whose character arc becomes of the film's most uplifting qualities.The visual effects were flawless and were rightfully so nominated for Best visual effects at the 2005 Academy awards ceremony.Steven Spielberg has turned his usual friendly alien comes to Earth tale upside down and shown second rate directors like Roland Emmerich how an alien invasion film is really done!

You know it's a bad film when all you want is for the aliens to kill off one of the leading characters,"In the film ""Ed Wood"", producer George Weiss admits he is not interested in making classy films, just cheap crap.

All I can say is that, in Tom Cruise's shoes, I certainly would have fought tooth and nail NOT to have custody of Dakota Fanning. Within a couple of minutes of her first opening her mouth, I was hoping against hope that this whining petulant brat would fall victim to the Martians' heat ray - and I mean Dakota Fanning, not the character she plays.And when will film makers realise that, no matter how seamless the special effects, it's the story that counts?

This was dull and something we've all seen before,"War of the Worlds pretends to be smart and compelling but ultimately there was no thought put into the writing. Even the action scenes are on the weak and flimsy side. The entire movie lacks energy and especially lacks heart. Not only that, but there was zero chemistry between the stars--who have no personality or charisma, and there was no character development at all. Since the movie put way too much emphasis on the characters, this was a serious problem. This film had some nice effects that quickly became boring as their setup and overuse flowed for far too long.Who does this appeal to? Quite a large audience I guess video game enthusiasts, people who believe that loud music and fireworks serve the good cause of giving the intellect a rest while feeding into their emotional lives. Death and destruction do not an emotional movie make particularly in the absence of a single character that we care about. Don't waste your money here!!!",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A tense movie that matures and improves with age,"It seems that, as the years go by, War of the Worlds has steadily climbed the league ladder in my league of favourite movies. It hasn't dated at all and just gets better with each viewing, to the extent where each major scene can now be warmly received - much like those cinema fanatics that watch Grease or similar movies over and over enjoying each major scene as a mini-movie in itself. The tension just never lets up and Dakota Fanning is really excellent as the wide-eyed child not quite sure what is happening, often keeping the tension ramped up all on her own. I love the more gritty (for Spielberg) setting where Ray (Cruise) lives; the houses under the massive flyover is a treat for the eyes & way different to the more common American cladded pretty suburban houses. There are many memorable moments; the river of bodies, the first rise of a tripod, the way people are vaporised, the fiery runaway train, the moments before the aircraft scene where you, like the family, think it's a tripod attack... And if you like to watch movies based on a seasonal aspect, this is a very autumnal movie in the same way that (the original) Flatliners is. The cinematography is excellent, the acting is excellent and the story itself remains very modern.

Don't know if the chemistry on set was problematic or if it's something about their acting but none of the protagonists can really make me empathize with them.

Swann's Way,"Spielberg is usually smarter than this, because this was doomed from the very beginning. Forget that nowadays if Cruise is in the thing, it has to be stretched from something whole to a platform for his posturing.But quite apart from that there were already two excellent achievements for this. First we had the book, which has excellent energy: mechanical beasts as languid swans among us. Consummate language of inevitability.Then we had Orson Welles on Wells; the radio drama that blurred the definition of sight. Yes, this is about sight and always has been. The 1953 version acknowledged this and took out all the religious stuff and replaced it with things whose sight is lethal. And what things those eyes were! Designed on Mars to emulate beaux art wrapping of what in the fifties was considered the ultimate in high tech vision: the three dots of color TeeVee. The saucers in this case were floating on legs of electricity and exterminated gracefully.Sure, it was essentially a chase movie, but a chase of an eye following poor souls. What could be more cinematic? On the heels of this our genius in Hollywood decides to take the same material and scrub all the cinematic value out of it. Sure, he could have approached it with the same intelligence as ""Close Encounters,"" which was a French New Wave film about the creative discovery of imagination. It was essentially a movie about movies.Perhaps he didn't know. Perhaps he just didn't have time: this was pushed up two years ahead of schedule. Perhaps he just didn't care, since all his efforts at intelligent and meaningful film-making just blend into his more mundane commercial successes.But he does know how to stage a scene that manages motion: the orchestrated motion of camera, foreground and often opposing motion in the background. He doesn't do well in three dimensions and you can see every static storyboard along the way. But when he's good at vision, he's good.Plus. Plus this gives the opportunity of the extra motion of the swans, which is how Wells described the ships.But no dance here, no cinematic composition. And no languid ships. These are a cross between the monsters of ""Wild Wild West"" and ""Star Wars."" At least those were apt. These ships clunk and grind. They destroy and collect. Their eyes and weapons are different from each other. Instead of being otherworldly, they seem distinctly human, as if they were designed by Lex Luthor.Okay, so the story changes focus from being about invaders to being about Tom and kids. Even Mel Gibson in his basement was more engaging, and that's pretty damning.One final insult. This starts the same as the 1953 movie, with a narrator giving background. With Wells always in our minds, who is selected? Morgan Freeman. You may even like his avuncular, low key acting-as-appearance. But as he who introduces doom?

"Enjoyable, but not ""Earth shattering"".","Keep in mind that I watch movies totally for enjoyment and rate them on that basis only. I'll leave the technical discussions to those with more knowledge in that area.Things I liked about this movie: 1) Cool effects. The Martians were awesome. The destruction of humans, buildings & such was great and seamless. No hokey effects here! 2) Acting was believable---could have been better tho.Things I did not like about this movie: 1) Annoying sub-plot with Cruise & his family. That stuff doesn't belong in a sci-fi movie. (They did that crap in Starwars II also and it sucked.) If Cruise wants to play the daddy role, then find another movie to do it in. 2) Could have used more visuals of the Martians and more intensity when the humans' weaponry is being destroyed---you know, like tanks flying up in the air and exploding, planes crashing into stuff when they're beamed, etc. 3) Somehow it needed a little more explanation. You don't know where the Martians came from unless you've either read the novel or seen the original movie. And you have to guess at the atrocities they were using the humans for (of course if it's just for drinking the blood, then you've got another vampire movie on your hands) Why did they turn the humans to dust at first instead of capture them? And another thing, they should have explained how the Martian tripods got underground. I know the crazy guy said they were there for millions of years, but he wasn't believable.I really enjoyed watching this movie (mostly because of awesome effects), but later I thought about how much better it could have been. If you cut out some of the slow parts and add more effects (or intensify current ones) this movie would totally rock.Even tho I've dissed this movie a tad, you still have gotta see it. Few remakes make the grade, but this one does.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"No, not like Europe","Greetings again from the darkness. Let's start with the positive. This film boasts the greatest special effects on film to date. It easily surpasses the latest Star Wars or Lord of the Rings films. Some of the effects will leave you breathless and wide-eyed. The best compliment I can offer is, everything looks real ... even the unreal. The relentless pace will leave you feeling exhausted until the ending ruins that feeling. With world destruction going on how does anyone have pressed clothes, make-up and brushed hair? I will also say that the entire Tim Robbins (flashing his ""Mystic River"" accent) sequence was confusing and ridiculous except for the ""Jurassic Park"" type shot (remember the kids hiding in the kitchen?) Tom Cruise proves he is best at being Tom Cruise. In other words, he is no Tom Hanks as an actor. On the other hand, Dakota Fanning (""Man on Fire"" ""Cat and the Hat"" and little Melanie in ""Sweet Home Alabama"") shows off a much greater range than her overpaid, over-hyped and overexposed superstar screen dad. Film historian Steven Spielberg does a tip of the cap to the 1953 original by offering a quick shot of that film's stars, Gene Barry and Ann Robinson. Did anyone else notice that the sound emanating from the aliens sounded suspiciously like the opening chords to Black Sabbath's ""I am Iron Man""? Also, why is it that every Tom Cruise film has him running at least one wind sprint? Despite the negatives (and there are many), the film scores high due to the phenomenal technical film-making of Spielberg and ILM craftsmen.

Gets better over the years,"As a huge fan of the book, and the Jeff Wayne musical album, this was a mixed bag when I saw it in 2005.I rated it a 6/10 in 2005.In the past 16 years I've watched it a bunch of times and oddly, it gains half a point each time.Having having just watched the 4K restoration, a lot of what Spielberg was doing became clearer than any previous viewing:"".And that's not the 4K!I was 36 when I first saw it, and wanted an alien invasion movie.I'm now 52 and I finally get what this film is about.It's about an absent father stepping up when his children need him.Ray has two children and he matures during the movie to realise what each needs.One needs freedom, one needs protection.And he delivers on both counts.Spielberg uses a classic alien invasion movie to tell a story of a man who has been a poor father, but delivers when the cards are on the table.Something I cannot imagine their stepfather doing.Great film are made of great scenes strung together and to me, 2005 this was a bunch of great scenes that somehow didn't make a great movie.On my 2021 viewing, whatever gaps I originally saw are gone.Watched in the right way, this is a 10 out of 10 character arc, using an alien invasion a the motivation for our protagonist development.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Pretty Decent Update of the Story,"It's been a long while since I either watched the original movie by the same name or read HG Wells' novel, on which both movies are based, but my memory tells me that Steven Spielberg did a pretty decent job of updating the story for a modern audience, while at the same time keeping the essential elements of Wells' story intact. The updates are necessary to make the movie relevant to the modern era. The basic change is that Wells story begins with radio reports of explosions being observed on Mars. This movie features television reports of strange, electromagnetic weather disturbances - a necessary change since (a) radio is no longer the medium through which we get news, and (b) we now know too much about Mars for the explosions to be believable. In another bow to the modern context, there are also some shades of 9/11. The kids think the alien attack at first is a terrorist act, and watching the dazed people walking by posters of the missing brought back memories of that terrible day.Within the movie itself, there was sustained action right from the beginning, a pretty good flow to the story and generally good performances. Tom Cruise was good as Ray Ferrier, a divorced father who has to protect his children once the aliens begin their attack. I say Cruise was ""good"" only because that's my general reaction to his work. He always seems to handle his parts well, but there's just some intangible quality about him that prevents me from going any better than ""good."" In this movie, frankly speaking, his performance is not as good as Dakota Fanning's was as Ray's daughter Rachel. She nailed the part, I thought - showing exactly what I think would be the quickly rising level of terror a young child in such circumstances would experience. She is completely believable. I must say that I never really connected with the character of Robbie - Rachel's older brother, played by Justin Chatwin. I had trouble figuring out exactly where his character was coming from.After so much action, the end of the movie is a bit anti-climactic, but so is Wells' story (and deliberately so.) The point of the rather sudden and understated ending is the irony involved in it - for all our military and technical prowess, it turns out to be something that we usually try to eradicate that saves us. On the subject of military prowess, one thing I found passing strange is that in putting this into a 21st century context, Spielberg didn't portray the military using nuclear weapons against the alien invaders which to me, given the desperate circumstances, would have seemed reasonable.All in all, though, this is a very well done movie and well worth watching. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"it was an entertaining movie, what movie about aliens wouldn't?","I have to say that this movie wasn't all it was said to have been. There was not enough action; the action doesn't include every every single scene in the movie, despite the intro, being aliens attacking humans and killing them and the humans seem helpless to prevent it. You have the big scene in the beginning where the first aliens arrive, and that is how the movie should have been situated. After that there should have been a solution to how to stop the invaders. It didn't even live up to the name of War of the Worlds. This whole thing was one sided. It was very entertaining, I'll grant that, but for a Spielberg movie, I was a little disappointed. In my opinion, Independence Day is beat WOTW by a long shot. Cruise was decent, Fanning was superb, and Robbins gave a nice side effect. All in all, I gave it a six out of ten.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The film excelled in so may other fields  acting, atmosphere, special effects  that I was willing to overlook the usual Spielberg disadvantages","H.G. Wells's classic tale of aliens invading Earth has been a vital part of pop culture for over 100 years. What started as a sci-fi story back in 1898, was adapted (among other formats) into a radio play (with horrific results) in 1938, a ridiculously dated movie in 1953 and a melodramatic musical in 1978. Each retelling of the story placed the plot and characters in a social and political atmosphere that captured the essence of the period's fears and doubts within the artistic format.With these given facts, it was only a matter of time until the 21st century would see its own popular adaptation of the subject material. Someone had to retell the story while capturing the paranoia and true fright the post-9/11 world has been feeling ever since the notorious terror attacks. When Hollywood chose icons Steven Spielberg (director) and Tom Cruise (actor) to head this remake, a modern classic has been born. After striking lightning once with Minority Report, the creative duo set out to tell the story of an alien invasion from the point of view of a father and his two children, who are trying to find their way to shelter, and security, within the mass mayhem that follows the invasion.Cruise plays Ray Ferrier, a working, divorced man, who witnesses an extra terrestrial attack during what was meant to be another weekend he spent with his kids  son Robbie (Justin Chatwin) and daughter Rachel (the obnoxiously precocious Dakota Fanning). When the alien killing machines evaporate people into thin air while Ferrier runs home to save his children, our flawed hero becomes covered with the dust that was once human beings. Throughout the entire film, we watch him try to salvage his family in a chaotic world. We are never told who the aliens are and we never see generals or politicians handling the crisis. Instead, we are only revealed to the news reports and destruction our heroes encounter. The screen shows us tanks and soldiers running over the hill towards a battle against the alien tripods, but they never take us to the other side of the hill, to show us what's really going on.Watching the movie, I couldn't help but compare the dust Ferrier was covered in with photos from Ground Zero on the day of the attack. The aliens, in my opinion, were sophisticated allegories to the terrorists' threat: we never see their faces until the film is near its end, we never fully understand them; yet they pose a threat to our existence, so we have no alternative then to fight them off.The only thing that truly bothered me was the ending, which was both too sudden and abrupt, as well as overly clichéd in my own humble opinion. But then again, the film excelled in so may other fields  acting, atmosphere, special effects  that I was willing to overlook the usual Spielberg disadvantages (let's face it, the man doesn't know how to end a film) and enjoy the overall view as a haunting mirror to the way our society behaves during this frightening first decade of the 21st century.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Original is way better,"You've seen plenty of movies featuring lots of action but little character development and dialogue. This is just the other side of the coin: plenty of focus on characters while the alien invasion is a background task. Great special effects are a diversion from a Spielbergian soap opera about a divorced part-time father and his kids, especially the son (who looks almost as old as dad) who rediscover their love for one another while giant metal alien guided machines emerge from the earth and sizzle people with death rays and poop out human blood. Despite a strong focus on the son and his apparent desperation to become a man by throwing himself into harms way, little is really served by the father-son angst, nor does the viewer care really at any level. Cruise's acting in this one goes from great, to mediocre to overacting and back to great, sometimes all within minutes.The best part about this film, apart from its obviously expectations-met sfx, is Tim Robbins brief role as a mental case hiding out in his basement. Robbins is just great in anything he does, and this one is no exception. In fact, I wanted to see and learn more about Robbins character than the aliens outside, scooping up people and pooping out their blood.The original film version had so much more character and heartfelt drama. I think Spielberg's come a long, long way in his career and unfortunately, I think I like his older stuff much better.One last thing, I'm tired of today's generation of action movies where any scene using sfx features a gloomy, or dimly lit background, whether outdoors or inside.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Just Another Day  When The Planet Is Attacked,"This ""War of the Worlds"" is just an overblown disaster movie. It is pretty much the old version with Gene Barry just updated with fancier, well-integrated CGI, a lot more extras and heavy-handed 9/11 references.We first see Tom Cruise as his working class ""All the Right Moves"" character aged into ""Ray,"" an irresponsible divorced dad. Then the aliens land and he spends the rest of the movie dealing with just one damn thing after another with his kids in trying to go over the river and through the woods to grandma's house.And that's it. There are only occasional thoughts in this movie's head.As a sci fi movie, the basic conception of the alien weapons gestating underground then kick-started by electromagnetic streaks of lightning is visually fun, if a bit of a ""Tremors"" re-tread. We see the aliens and their weapons almost too close up so they lose their mysteriousness as a fear factor, though they look a lot like the unconvincing ones in ""Signs,"" but of course with E.T. hands, and they may intentionally be a bit cheesy to recall the earlier version.(The Hensons' Creature Shop should really do all aliens.)As a post-apocalyptic examination of human reactions in the face of catastrophe, we get the usual, but very large, frantic crowds of panicked and fighting refugees and only glimmers of originality, particularly when Tim Robbins shows up as a shell-shocked survivor. But the film in general takes a much more individual survival view of vengeance than either ""Revenge of the Sith"" or ""Batman Begins,"" as this is supposed to be grounded in reality.The real references are hammered home with the kids twice asking dad ""Is this the terrorists?"" after he staggers catatonic-ally home covered in white ash, streets capes full of posted notices of the missing, and falling (empty) clothes dropping slowly to the ground from up high.Notably, it is not Cruise's character who tries to be some sort of hero, but his teen son, well-played by Justin Chatwin. His rebellious exchanges with his dad are the most natural dialog in the film.A key decision point in how far ""Ray"" will go to choose to take on family responsibility takes place off-screen, despite the PG-13 rating, which made me ponder how other directors would have shown that struggle not just more graphically but more emotionally. Let alone that because Cruise is such a big star we never for a moment worry about his survival, despite the number of times it sure looks like he's being blown up but his character doesn't even get injured. Director Steven Spielberg flirts with an homage to ""The Searchers"" at the conclusion, but falls for a sentimental touch instead that had the whole audience a bit quizzical as to its believability, even as it stresses the family lessons learned.Dakota Fanning is annoyingly Hollywood precocious in the first half, but settles down naturally into scared kid.Some touches had a quizzical symbolism, such as the effort to reach Boston's Back Bay past frequent sign posts to ""Athens"", the ex-wife being pregnant with the rich new husband (so how old was she when she left the seat of America's revolution to have their teenager?), the teen's school paper on the French occupation of Algeria, the undamaged Minuteman statue, and so on.It was nice to see the working class bit parts taken by actors from ""The Wire"" and the best production design is in the early recreation of their dense, close-knit neighborhood, even if Cruise makes no effort to have a Jersey docks accent.John Williams' music is commendably more restrained than usual and the long patches with silence let you hear your breath catching and heart beating faster through the best, most tense scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Annoying Child alert!,"This remake of the 1956 classic has some stirring moments, especially the ferry crossing in upstate New York at Athens. But, just like those original Star Trek episodes with annoying children, this is film too is burndened with a truly annoying pestilence portrayed by the very young Dakota Fanning, who certainly has matured into an interesting actor. Here, however, she shrieks, shrieks louder, and shrieks loudly again and again.We know that Tom Cruise's character will live, and there will be many dead before the aliens perish, but the many thoughtless moments from start to finish make one wonder what sort of pacing Steven Spielberg had in mind.Tim Robbin's skills are wasted in his role as a grizzled resistance fighter.The film closes with a totally pointless and cheesy cameo by Gene Barry and Anne Robinson, who played the major characters in the the 1956 film.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Sci-Fi & Disaster,"There is something special about this film...my three viewings of it have brought huge joy. The original War Of The Worlds (1953) will always have a place but there is room for another version where the alien ships have towering legs and the score is done by John Williams (you must hang around for the end credits as the pumping old- fashioned Williams score finally plays without actors talking over it).Instead of the usual guy and gal we see in these block busters, it is father and kids. The three main players perform very well however during the early parts of the film before the lighting strikes it is a bit of a struggle to see Tom Cruise playing the concerned father (too soap-like). But once the ""storm"" appears we just go along with the thrill ride...once that alien craft appears it improves!War Of The Worlds is a sci-fic movie, a disaster movie, an action movie, a movie about a family, a military movie, and a movie that shows that CGI effects are not always a bad thing when used the right way. And, as I mentioned before, the old-fashioned John Williams score is a knockout, it has shades of overly-dramatic Williams music done for producer Irwin Allen in the 1960s and 1970s. In a nutshell, War Of The Worlds is how a block buster should be made, you are in the hands of true movie-makers.Added note: Australian viewers might be interested in an early scene in this film when Oz is mentioned in casual conversation.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Where's the war?,"The film is more about a man's personal family tragedy and it ignores the considerably larger issue, that being the fact that martians are taking over the world. There is a distinct lack of action in the film, to be honest there isn't really a war at all, the war goes on while Cruise roams from town to town hiding away, perhaps Spielberg was trying to avoid the film turning into independence day so he wanted to cut out a war. Once again Spielberg presents us with a torn up American family, he seems to be on this never ending quest to criticise the American family, sadly the family issues in this film become bigger than what the film really should be about and i was glad that the film came to such an abrupt end because the film wasn't worthy of having a good ending. In a TV appearance on channel 4 Spielberg said he didn't want it to be a Sci-fi movie but socio-logical, psychological, individual struggle in times of turmoil, pity.

Transparent...it's all been done before,"Not a horrible film but pretty exhausted on the creative front. I watched this movie and never really got into it...I've seen it all before, ID4, Signs, V, and the original War of the Worlds. This one brings nothing new to the equation. Is it competently made? This is Spielberg, of course it is and just like a Spielberg film everything is blatantly obvious and of course the kids not really dead at the end. What I found most interesting about this film had nothing to do with the plot, it was all the Cruise-isms that were carefully woven into it. Think for a bit, Cruise and his character are both divorced with two children. Dock worker asks what's bugging him and he says ""Think of a couple women and I'll tell you"" or something to that effect. He's asked by his daughter ""What's the Capital of Australia?"" in jest. (Nicole Kidman's homeland...hmm). The scene with hundreds of people trying to jack Tom's car left me thinking of Cruise swarmed by movie fans at a premiere. Many sly references to Cruise's career are present throughout the film and honestly they were the only moments of interest for me. The tripods looked too much like the spider robots in minority report, and the aliens themselves looked too much like the ones from ID4. Remakes, sequels and films based of established properties...that's all Hollywood has for us, and this one's no exception. Dakota fanning's a great actress, everyone involved in this picture is so talented...I can only imagine what they could do with an original idea. All throughout the film I wonder, ""Is this the best they can do?"" and sadly...it is.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It was OK...could have been better.,"I saw this movie twice in theaters when it came out in June. I thought it was pretty well done, and the actors all did a good job. A couple things I could complain about would be how people were recording the alien tripods on the video cameras, even after all electricity was supposed to be not working. I mean come on, if Tom's WRISTWATCH isn't even working, how the hell would people be able to use camcorders and digital cameras?!Also, another part that didn't make a lot of sense was at the end of the movie when the kid's parent's house is the only one unharmed, and Robby comes home from the army without a scratch. I was kind of hoping that they would be told ""I'm sorry, but your son didn't make it"" or something like that, but no.A lot of people were saying that Dakota screamed too much throughout the movie, and thought she was annoying, but you can't judge her acting abilities on this movie alone. I'll admit it was a little annoying after a while, but she didn't choose to act like that, she only did what the directer told her. Little Dakota has been my favorite child actress for a while now, and I think she did a great job in the movie, despite what many other people are saying about her.I only wish that this movie had been longer. It seemed so short when I watched it in the theater. It was a good movie, but if they had taken some extra time to perfect it, and fix the mistakes, it could have been a lot better. I give it a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
excellent sci-fi film,I never saw the original so I don't know how the stories differ but this version was really good. The special effects were amazing. It really seemed like all those people were fleeing the tri-pods and getting zapped. It looked like Cruise was literally running only feet from falling debris.Cruise plays a dad who is a real jerk to his young daughter and older son. They are visiting him for the weekend in the city when the lightening storms start. From there we see tri-pods coming out of the ground and causing havoc. It was awesome.They escape in the only working vehicle on the way to Boston where his ex wife is. They stay the first night at his ex's house and end up with an airplane outside the front door. So their trek continues and they meet up with more tri-pods and eventually his son goes off. So Cruise and his daughter take up in this crazy guy's basement for some tense scenes.And I won't say how it ends because you should be surprised. And I liked that finally there is a disaster movie that doesn't have the President and scientists and skipping all over the place. It focuses on one family.FINAL VERDICT: This is the story of how one dad goes from jerk to hero during an alien invasion. This is the must see film of the summer.

"A great ""human"" sci-fi movie.","Apparently almost every reviewer seems compelled to compare the movie they are commenting on, to previous films/books they are based on, instead of giving a clear objective on the film at hand.Steven Spielberg's ""War Of The Worlds"" does a great job showing one man's struggle against what is happening around him while trying to keep his two kids safe.The ""burning train"" scene, is flawless in setting up what this movie is about. You don't get to see how the world's armies are battling it out with the tripods, as you would expect from a Hollywood production, with lots of fancy CGI on screen, instead, Tom Cruise's character (an average Joe) handle's most situations as a normal human being would. Every reaction is believable, and something most of the audience can relate to.The cinematography itself manages to set a certain hopeless feel to it, the soundtrack is barely noticeable (and that's good), the acting is good, mainly Tom Cruise, Dakota Fanning's character can be very annoying in the film, but then again, her reactions seem to fit in well as to how a child her age would deal with things.All in all, a very enjoyable sci-fi movie. Not my favorite genre, but when a movie is well done like this one, that doesn't matter now does it.Fully recommend this one as a must see to everyone with at least a slight interest in sci-fi / apocalyptic movies.

Some Great Family Dynamics & Visuals Weighed Down By A Plot That Severely Underwhelms,"After originally seeing Steven Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" on the big screen in 2005 and remembering feeling underwhelmed, I returned to it recently for a re-watch. Though the passage of time led me to appreciate the great Tom Cruise performance, touching family dynamics, and iconic visuals a bit more than that first go-round, the utterly underwhelming plot structure of the experience still caps my star ranking at 6/10.For a very basic overview, ""War of the Worlds"" is of course based on the H. G. Wells novel of the same name, here updated for a modern audience. Ray Ferrier (Cruise) is the stereotypical ""deadbeat Dad""-a dock worker who provides little to no supervision/guidance and an empty refrigerator when its time for custody weekend with kids Robbie (Justin Chatwin) and Rachel (Dakota Fanning) after his divorce from wife Mary Ann (Miranda Otto). But that weekend just so happens to be the one in which the world is upended by an alien invasion. On the run to Boston to reunite with family, Robbie and his children must navigate the onslaught both physically and emotionally.There is actually some really good emotional material in ""War of the Worlds"". Cruise nails-as he usually does-his character arc from disinterested loaf to engaged father, and Chatwin portrays the perfect rebellious high school teen boy in Robbie. Fanning absolutely steals every scene she is in-mind-blowing for a 10-year-old! As the film unfolds, you'll find yourself truly engaged in their survival quest.Some of the concept visuals in the movie are also quite impressive. One can imagine Spielberg thinking ""how cool would it be for a fiery train to zoom by on the tracks?!"" or ""what if someone were zapped right out of their clothes?!"". His expertise in translating those mind-images to the big screen is unparalleled, so the visual landscape is filled with interesting-to-iconic moments.The major problem with ""War of the Worlds"", though, is that plot-wise it is mess-I can't really express it any clearer than that. While I appreciate the effort from Spielberg to translate Wells' material into a post-9/11 world, it fails far more often than it succeeds. Truth be told, I think I would have preferred no context being given to the ""tri-pod"" invaders, as the explanations or musings presented here range from asinine to embarrassing. The opening and closing narrations from Morgan Freeman are perhaps the best non-spoiler examples I can give of this film's plot failures.So, much like my initial theater experience, I have ""War of the Worlds"" pegged as a 6/10 star flick. There is a lot to like and be moved or entertained by within its runtime, but it is based on such a ridiculously-executed plot premise that it has an extremely low ceiling.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Like an unsatisfying orgasm - all of the buildup with little climax,"I'm literally just back from seeing this at my local cinema. Personally, I thought it was a good bit of entertainment with lots of tension, impressive effects and nice action. Cruise is Cruise and Dakota pretty much does what you'd expect from a child prodigy. Some bits feel a bit slow though and there's a lack of character from the performers. I think Tim Robbins' character had the most personality amongst the others, although nobody really knows why he is the way he is...As far the much talked about ending, it's a fair bit unsatisfying. As I say in my title, it's like an unsatisfying orgasm - all of the exciting buildup with little climax. Good entertainment though. Worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
War of the Worlds,"With War Of The Worlds, Steven Spielberg shows us what he has learnt from over 30 years of film-making. The film has all his best moments rolled into one package  it has the brutality of Saving Private Ryan (1998), the intensity of Jaws (1975), and the very best of effects he has been involved in. But it does have a problem and that, strangely enough, stems not from the director but from his source material.Tom Cruise plays Ray Ferrier, a dock worker who has custody of his children for the weekend (screaming youngster and rebellious teen, naturally). He's not the world's best dad, but fortunately his parental inadequacy is put on the bench when aliens come and invade, wanting to both destroy and harvest human beings. And this is some invasion  for a good half hour the audience is subjected to an invasion of such ferocity that comparisons to Saving Private Ryan (1998) will come up, and be totally valid. In an interesting little twist from the H.G.Wells book, these aliens have been here all along, buried under the earth waiting to be reactivated. When they come up out of the ground, they tear apart cities like paper, and use their death rays to exterminate humans with such speed and viciousness, that the audience really forgets to breathe for the entire sequence; it really is astonishing.Then things go in a different direction  we move from big destruction to an intimate, almost in the realms of a horror film, sequence. Our heroes are in a basement with Harlan Ogilvy (Robbins), and the aliens come into their hiding place. A Martian arm (though curiously we are never actually told that they are Martian) comes down to search the basement, with the survivors having to move around to stay out of its sight. It is reminiscent of the kitchen scene from Jurassic Park (1993), and is all the better for it. Mixed in here is the conflict between Ray and Ogilvy; Ray wants to hide, Ogilvy wants to fight. There is an immensely tense scene where Ray and Ogilvy are fighting over a shotgun, whilst trying to stay as quiet as possible, so the Martians in the next room don't hear them. It gives the film real power over the audience, as we are kept guessing all the way.H.G.Wells' book has been updated for the 21st century and, on the whole, this is a good idea. It gives us some perspective and modern relevance  the first thing that Ray's children ask about the attacks is if they are terrorists  and with the aliens' shields, the whole situation seems utterly helpless. We see the military swept aside so easily, their counter-attacks ineffective. We see a crowd of people fighting Ray over the one remaining working car. Spielberg also gets some great shots in there too  highlights include a ferry being tipped over in the Hudson river, and a train with all its carriages on fire speeding over a level crossing. It shows Spielberg's rarely seen but strong potential for darkness.The difference between War Of The Worlds and many other disaster films is that here we don't see any authority  no presidential reactions and such like. This is very much the tale of one family's survival and the invasion from their point of view. Ray is not a hero, and the only time he is forced into a situation when he has to become one is when he is trying to protect his daughter; it is sheer desperation that drives him. Cruise does an excellent job of portraying Ray as a hopeless father, but also powerless to stop events that are shattering their lives  he simply does not know what to do; so he runs with the crowds. Dakota Fanning is likewise excellent as his daughter Rachael, although she spends most of the film screaming. There is not much time to really get to know the characters though, which is a shame as it makes the Ferrier family seem rather distant, as if the writer thought ""this could be anyone"". Maybe that was the point, but it distances the audience somewhat. The Martians are well done, keeping their tripods from the book (rather than ships like the 1953 film version) but updating them to look more technological and menacing. Arguments about the impracticality of tripods are pointless  no one really cares as the film is too involving to spend time thinking about such things.The problem comes at the end. Spielberg has never been that great at endings recently, but this ending is not all his fault. He sticks to the ending from the book, which is something that even Wells enthusiasts have never been too pleased with. Almost as soon as the attack comes, it is over. It is hard to believe the cause of the Martian demise, but Spielberg would have had little choice but to keep the ending if he wanted to keep the film as War Of The Worlds and not just any old invasion film. At just under the two hour mark, the film keeps you gripped all the way through, with some stunning effects, edge-of-your-seat tension and good old fashioned explosions. This is Steven Spielberg's 'greatest hits' collection, and it all comes together extremely well.Rated: 8/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spielberg's Disturbing Apocalyptic Saga Sports a Mastery of the Long Take,"Steven Spielberg's up-to-date rendition of H.G. Wells's relentless nightmare is a lot better than it is given credit for being. It follows a real family with real complications, none of which Hollywood screenwriters were to be expected to create when enlisted to construct a formula visual effects extravaganza, and because writers David Koepp and Josh Friedman took that expository time to make us care about the friction between self-centered New Jersey dock worker Tom Cruise, his 10-year-old daughter Dakota Fanning, who suffers from a panic disorder and his teenage son Justin Chatwin, who outright resents him, the cataclysmal disaster that comes down just like the wall clouds and electromagnetic pulses that unleash it is all the more harrowing.I was glued to Spielberg's Morgan Freeman-narrated blockbuster. The fears it stimulates create an unrelenting mood of hopeless, helpless fright which we share with the people in the movie. Spielberg's mastery of marrying spectacle with tension, working with nine-figure budgets and hundreds of thousands of people, none of which deter his strength of vision, generates a dark realization in us, rather than a simple escapist entertainment. He presents strange cloud formations associated with thunder strikes, an arresting amount lower than the rain-free base of the sky. It starts to let loose poundings in the in close proximity to Tom Cruise's everyday Newark neighborhood, immobilizing all of the functioning electronic mechanisms nearby, including cars, leaving everyone trapped. A huge Tripod android surfaces from underground and commences in vaporizing people and buildings in its ample path.There is truly a disturbing feeling of tragedy whenever there is a casualty of the least significant bystander. There is something very freaky about red weed, the ever-growing plant that, according to H.G. Wells's story, gives Mars its fuzzy blood red color. Ships sink. Cities are destroyed. Children are in peril. Blood is everywhere. Tentacles. A magnificent plane wreck. And a treacherous expedition from New York to Boston with these devastating obstacles exploding in the way.This sci-fi action chase picture certainly has its glaring clichés here and there, but it is very observed, as films should be, especially spectacle films. The standpoint of the story is very personal. Any given human being can feel connected with the point of view, because it's about a family struggling unremittingly to survive and survive together, and they're contained by the most ambitiously dire and staggering events one could envision.Not being particularly partial to monster-budgeted special effects blockbusters, I much prefer a director like Spielberg, whose knowledge of film language can be seen in extensive concept shots rather than in heaps of coverage. Spielberg's disturbing apocalyptic saga sports a mastery of the long take, not to mention the logistically impossible several-minute- long tracking and dollying. Many of the film's biggest effects shots are unbroken, where the audience studies its magnitude and absorbs its impact. Michael Bay, or even a fairly talented director like Tony or Ridley Scott, would create artifice with a dozen camera angles, where no shot lasts longer than a brief moment before the film cuts to another. Spielberg, no matter how layman the majority of his film's audiences are likely to be, refuses to talk down to his audience. What makes this $132 million disaster movie above average is that there is fluency, ominous pace and a sense of realistic style, all of which put us within the actual events.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Oh no. Spielberg does it again,"I love and respect Spielberg, let's make that absolutely clear. I grew up with the man. But, that love and respect, clearly, is exclusively one sided. I have the feeling I've been treated like a moron. There are so many concessions made in the film in a vain attempt to reach everybody, that at the end of the day, most everybody is disappointed. It's not one thing or the other. Much like ""Artificial Intelligence"" Steven Spielberg, more than any of his contemporaries, has everything at his disposal. He has the luxury to choose the best of the best in every department, so why not apply that standard to the most important, the writing. Here the source was H.G Wells so, no excuses for the cheap shots and the smart ass wise cracks. I think that compromises are, in a business of millions and millions of dollars, unavoidable, but, how terrible when the compromise takes over. When marketing researchers have so much power. I think that compromises based on political correctness have taken over the world of Spielberg. I remember when Elia Kazan received the Academy Award to his career and the polemic that followed. Spielberg found a way to be okay with everybody. He applauded but didn't stand up. Is that his position? He made comments about War of the Worlds, hinting that the updated story reflected what was happening in the world today. Really? There is a line thrown out there casually on purpose ""Occupation never works"" or something like that. But that's not nearly enough. It is an insult to our intelligence. ""War of the Worlds"" has a terrific opening. We are several steps ahead of the characters populating the world in the movie. The thrilling anticipation of what we know is coming, raises our expectations to levels that, naturally, are impossible to reach. Tom Cruise is terrific, but the film moves between Wells and Spielberg's worlds without being fair to either one. Technically the film is astonishing, but the soul is sadly not there.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Extremely disappointing,"The 2005 'War of the Worlds' was one of those movies I thought I would talk about using the phrase ""very enjoyable at the time but imminently forgettable - a phrase I use for many Hollywood blockbusters.I was wrong! For me, it was boring almost throughout and certainly imminently forgettable. Sure the effects were well up to scratch, and I like the tripods - but the characters COMPLETELY lacked soul and although the film followed the basic storyline, thank heaven - I was forever awaiting the film's end. I generally like Tom Cruise but this did nothing for him, and I can hardly believe that Spielberg could have directed this.Read the book, or see the much superior original film version.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A film of two halves!,"I will star by saying that i have not seen the original, heard the CD or read the book so i may be out of my depth commenting on this, on the other hand i can take an unbiased view. The previous Spielberg/Cruise picture Minority Report, while unsuccessful in the box office was a solid film with a good story and great effects. This one however was aimed at a much bigger audience, being based on such a famous novel. Basing films on famous books is a brave move and often it backfires as u have to pay more attention to detail to keep the fan boys happy, however i didn't know the story so went into this with an open mind trying not to be influenced by the critics.The first hour of this film went really well, it sucked you in to the plight of Cruise and his Kids on there mission to get away from the awe inspiring Tripods, the effects were brilliant the acting solid and the pace of the film relentless, although there were a few mistakes involving EMP(you'll know what i mean if you watch it), i found myself getting involved with the film, Spielberg is a master at this. However the second half is not so good, packed with schmaltz galore and the pointlessness of Tim Robbins character, combined with a completely flat ending made the first half a waste of time building up to a massive disappointment.Maybe instead of a remake, a film based around aliens invading the earth, with which war of the worlds was an obvious template and paying respects to the original would have sufficed.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not a Disappointment,"I remember how excited I was when I saw this remake was being done. Having been totally burned on the remake of ""The Time Machine"" (all that money and no imagination--what was wrong with the basic story?), I was suspect. While the new ""War of the Worlds"" parts company with the novel by H. G. Wells, it stands very well by itself. First of all, the machines of destruction are amazing to look at. They are truer to the original than the fifties version (although it is still a really cool movie). The overriding threat of societal annihilation comes through. Even Wells let us know this was a culture beyond our earthbound knowledge, so their war machines had to dwarf our meek efforts.The human story does very well. Tom Cruise playing a self-absorbed character (imagine that) grows throughout the film. Dakota Fanning is our new Wunderkind actress and plays opposite Cruise very well. Their travels to avoid death leave us on the edges of our seats. Just as with the original, it's everyone for themselves--the best and the worst of humanity show through with a few shell shocked nut cases and survivalists thrown in for good measure.The scene along the river, with people trying to cross to safety, gives us a titanic (no pun intended) view of our fragility. The weakness is a barrage of schmaltz in the second half of the movie, particularly in the ending. You can see visions of ""Close Encounters"" here and there in images Spielberg puts forth. Nevertheless, it's really an exciting film and should stand the test of time. Good nightmare material.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great movie,"I really liked this movie, I saw it about 3 times in the cinema back in 2005, i loved it each time and see about 1000 times on DVD now, i still love it.Ray Ferrier get home after work, he see hes ex-wife Mary Ann drops off their children, Rachel and Robbie, at his house. Tom dose not seem to get a long at all, when Ray falls a sleep and then he find out that Robbie as taken off with car.As leaves the house, he see people standing in middle of the road looking at sky, seeing some of really odd cloud, they rush to the back garden to see more, then some of lighting storm, and it was not normal lighting storm, (The special effect for that great,i loved it).As Ray leaves and seeing everyone rushes to were the lightning as hit about 10 times and then see this Tripod that came from underneath the ground that starts to kill people.The rest of movie is about father and kids trying to survive for rest of movies while the Tripod destroy everything around them.Great acting from the whole cast, as already said the special effects was absolutely brilliant.I give this movie 9 out 10",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Why remake a movie if it doesn't improve on the original?!,"I must say I found the movie utterly disappointing...Why oh why have a director like Spielberg remake a movie that was perfect if he's just going to improve on the Special Effects (which understandably are better than the original's although not particularly groundbreaking). Nothing significant has been changed.Spielberg's direction is so discreet, you have to wonder if anyone directed the movie at all so little are the changes from the original version.Some scenes are directly ripped off (oh sorry... I forget... they're HOMAGES!) and Tom Cruise is his usual self... not especially at ease in the part but glamorous and well... a little over the top. The kids are cute, Tim Robbins is impeccable and Miranda Otto is underused... what else is new?Other than that, it's Special Effects and alien movies clichés.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not really a War of the Worlds, but rather watch character running from alien death machines with family in tow.","It had its moments, but along with those it also had its faults...a lot of em. I enjoyed it for the most part, but there are so many scientific errors just one person can take. Even if you could disregard them all the action just about stops once Ray and his daughter enters the basement with the crazy Tim Robbins character. First what is good? The first moments of alien encounter when the tripods emerge from the ground and begin incinerating everyone and everything. The destruction as Cruise and family escape one step ahead of the tripods in the only working vehicle. Moments of humor as the family arrives at the mother's house. The destruction shown as planes apparently crashed in the night. A ferry boat ride of death. All this makes for really entertaining theater, but there are just too many faults to rate this a really good movie. In fact, so far it is one of the weakest movies I have seen so far this year. Why? Well for some reason all electrical appliances are knocked out, even watches yet somehow a video camera is still functioning? For some reason the family has the only working car yet the military vehicles work fine and many areas are still with power so the cars in those areas should work right? The aliens vaporize some people, but then capture others? Just what was the point of the red vines, granted it made for a rather creepy scene with Cruise's character looking out over a field, but in the end it just seemed to make for a rather pointless plot cul de sac. Then there is the scenes with Robbin's character, that quite frankly bog the movie down to a stand still. The basement scene went on way to long, I am guessing it was there to keep down costs as while they were in the basement they were also saving money by not having to show us the destruction caused by the tripods. Still though up to that point there were some nice action scenes and such, but still not up to par with movies that cost a fraction of the money such as ""Land of the Dead"" made for 15 million, it looks just as impressive in places as this 135 million dollar movie. It needs more, more stars, more perspective than what we get. This movie just looks at one family's struggle during an alien invasion, unfortunately that has been done before in a movie called ""Signs"". There is really nothing new being brought to the table here.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pretty Good Movie!,"First Thoughts: .... *speechless* ....Pro's: Overall, I thought this was one of Spielberg's better films. I preferred this one to E.T. *gag* Tom Cruise, who I'm not a huge fan of, does a pretty convincing performance. It seriously is a Doom's Day kind of movie. I mean you see people getting blown up and killed. Don't take the kids to see it. No kids under the age of 11, I would say. But, for teenagers, it's a pretty okay movie. Adults, you'll enjoy this. This version is more true to the book and not so much to the 1950's version. My dad, who is a huge fan of the old version, thought it was a pretty good movie, and he wanted to see it again. Previously, I had neither read the book, nor seen the original film, but I kind of enjoyed this movie. If you're wondering what it's about, the title gives it all away.Con's: The action sequences are very long, and just keep going on and on. It's bloody and gory, so it's definitely not a kiddie movie. In the movie, the people keep looking back, watching what's chasing them instead of running away. I was saying, ""Run! Stupid people, run!"" at the screen.Overall: Go see it if your a fan of the book, movie, or if you're just interested and/or curious. The ending is surprisingly simple.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
September 11...PTSD,"This Movie Suffers Readily from what could be called 9-11 PTSD. The References and Remembrances are anything but Subtle, and sometimes Forced and Unrealistic like the Bulletin Boards Popping Up almost Instantaneously with a Defiance of Time-Space that can only come from the most Manipulative of Directors.There is Smoke and the Dust, and let's leave it at that and move on to the Remake at hand. It is a Sombre Affair to be sure with the SFX neither Epic or Eye-Popping, just Impressive enough to be Realistically Frightening. There are some Horror Movie Chills like the River Scene, not the Titanic like Ferry, but the other one and the Bloody Creeping Vines and Vampire like Suggestions.It is a Half-Good Mood Piece with much Crying, and Wailing, and Gnashing of Teeth and it has a Dark Atmosphere that is Unlike most Alien Invasion Movies. But there are other things that make this a Not-So-Entertaining Bore. The Family Dysfunction is Played Heavily and is Talked and Emoted to Death, and the Half-Hour Basement Retreat goes No-Where and is just Dull, even when the Creatures Show Up to give the Audience its only Close-up View and it is so Derivative as to be a Real Letdown.Overall more of a Horror Movie than Sci-Fi and the Typical Spielberg Stuff is too Heavy Handed, even for Him, as Trademark Sentimentalism and the Usual Teen and Pre-Teen Characters do make for more than the Expected Irritation. Worth a View for some Thrills and at least it's a Somewhat Different Downbeat Turn for an Audience Friendly Director who is Undoubtedly still Suffering from the After Effects of September 11, 2001, or Maybe He is Exploiting the American Population and Their Trauma.

"Not so bad..., but different","Story: If you walk into the cinema with the expectation watching a movie like Independence Day, you will be disappointed.

Be careful what you wish for...,"One of the commonest complaints about sci-fi movies is that there is too much reliance on special effects and not enough character development. In this movie, the sci-fi story is just background noise to one of the planet's most dysfunctional families. Cruise's character is a clueless jerk and his kids are obnoxious. Every time that little girl screamed or decided to be a pain in the butt at the worst possible times, I was hoping that the death ray would get her - or at least that someone would stuff a sock in her mouth. When the son is determined to go off and fight the aliens, all I could think was, ""Great, 1 down, 2 to go, and now maybe the real story (of a war between the worlds) will begin."" It's usually a big mistake to make your main characters and hero totally unlikeable and lacking in charm - I didn't care if they were all pureed into alien V-8 juice. This could have been a great movie if it had used the title as its storyline. As it is, it should have been called, ""Father Doesn't Know Best, His Kids Think They Do And They Never Let Him Forget It.""",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Disappointing,"If you're going to rate a film on pure spectacle, this one would easily get a 10 - it's utterly astounding.The acting is uniformly good, and the idea of showing the film purely from the perspective of Cruise's character - so the audience knows nothing that he doesn't know - works extremely well.But there's no plot, no underlying logic behind *anything* that happens, be it human or alien-initiated - every single plot decision seems to have been taken from the perspective of 'wouldn't it be cool if...' or 'Let's shock people with the nastier sides of human nature now' or 'Now we must give our hero a tough decision'... this was plotting-by-numbers at its most obvious (and painful)With a decent script, this should have been one of the best Scifi movies ever made.

To call this Disappointing is the understatement of the year.,"The same sense of disappointment most people felt after watching ""The Matrix Reloaded"" or ""Phantom Menace"" likely will be rekindled with this film. Yes, I know giving in to hype can be a dangerous thing but it's STEVEN SPIELBERG for God sake. I was excited about this movie. After seeing it however, I now hope it lands in theatres with a resounding thud. I doubt it will but it deserves as much. To call this disappointing is the understatement of the year.

Action packed spectacle,In Steven Spielberg 's 2005 version of H. G. Wells' classic science fiction tale Tom Cruise takes the leading role however it's Dakota Fanning who steals the show. As you'd expect there's plenty of action set pieces but also more dramatic and emotional scenes too. Tom Cruise puts in one of his better performances and his character is surprisingly nuanced for an action hero. The scenes with a wonderfully creepy Tim Robbins are disturbing and have an unexpected conclusion.My only grype would be the cinematography which goes for a sort of over exposed dream sequence look which is completely out of place.,7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Simply okay,"A friend of mine has a young baby who could affectionately be classed as a screamer. Thus far, the only foolproof method of placating her is to turn on the soothing tones of the narrator from Jeff Wayne's War of the Worlds. I'll be advising him at the earliest opportunity that if he ever wants the child to sleep again, he should on no account consider Steven Spielberg's War of the Worlds as a future companion piece for her. Because this is truly the stuff of nightmares, a primal horror of such ferocity that not even Richard Burton will be able to calm you down after it.Freely adapted from the novel by H.G. Wells, for the first fifteen or so minutes it's a domestic drama, as blue collar worker Ray Ferrier (Cruise) struggles with the task of looking after his two children (Fanning and Chatwin) for the weekend while his ex-wife (Otto) goes to Boston with her new husband. Ray is not a good father, as evidenced by his empty fridge and dubious methods of interacting with his kids. Fortunately for him, the end of the world intervenes and saves him from what could have been a really tough couple of days.News reports have been telling of freak electrical storms around the globe, and when the lightning hits the Ferrier's neighbourhood, what begins as a cool light show quickly turns into something infinitely more dangerous. As the streets crack apart and buildings crumble, the source of all this devastation reveal themselves from deep beneath the ground - giant mechanical tripods that begin disintegrating everyone and everything in sight. Barely managing to get out of town alive, Ray and his family flee cross country, desperately trying to evade their attackers' constant onslaught while clinging to the slim hope of safety.No one would have believed in the first years of the 21st century that two of cinema's foremost exponents of summer entertainment would have come together again and fashioned something as unrelentingly grim as War of the Worlds. Merciless in its intensity, uncompromising in its brutality, this film will rock you to your core. This is not invasion, it's apocalypse. The first scenes of alien rampage set the tone, as thousands of people are mown down without regard or pity, and the film continues in the same vein throughout, alternating scenes of massacre with blind hysteria and moments of quiet reflection and sorrow.Spielberg throws in many a nod to his own back catalogue - the 'raptor kitchen hunt from Jurassic Park is recreated as an unbearably tense game of alien hide and seek that embarrasses Shyamalan's risible Signs. The hand-held confusion and immediacy of Saving Private Ryan is recalled in the scenes of destruction that bring a new realism to CGI. Not that the special effects are the ultimate barometer of the quality of War of the Worlds but, as it happens, they're simply astonishing. And yet Spielberg doesn't draw attention to them, often preferring to use an eye popping event in the background to accentuate the human misery being played out in front of it.The focus of this remains squarely on the Ferriers, with little or no indication given to events throughout the world. This puts a lot of pressure on the cast and they step up admirably. Tom Cruise remains an inexplicably underrated actor, and his work here is amongst his best ever. From his early scenes as a deadbeat weekend father, through his transformation into a reluctant hero, whether struggling to hold his emotions in check for the sake of the kids, or giving his all to protect them, he completely convinces. And what else is there to be said about the frighteningly talented moppet that is Dakota Fanning? In the last year alone she's more than held her own against big Denzel and now wee Tom, not to mention carving a few slices off the honey roasted rump of De Niro.War of the Worlds is a terrifying potential vision of our own self inflicted doomsday, masquerading as a summer blockbuster. And if, after an hour and three quarters of total carnage, the resolution seems a little on the easy side, I'm afraid there's no one to blame for that but Mr. Wells.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The 1954 version just looks better every single day...,"Not even Mr Blockbuster Spielberg could save this film from being the rambling, incoherent mess that it turned out to be. Yes, it has nice special effects, but that could not compensate for the fact that it is rehashing a fifty year old plot and not doing much to even make it better. As everyone already knows the story of the alien invasion, Spielberg tries to add a new spin to it by focusing on one families struggle to reunite as this alien attack effects them. Spielberg plays up to every possible cliché in this film that at stages I actually thought this film was meant to be a parody on the original movie. Does the estranged father repair his relationship with his children by the end of the film? In classic Spielberg fashion, yes. Does Dakota Fanning act as nothing but a Drew Barrymore substitute in a film sorely lacking E.T.'s charm? Check yes to that as well. Isn't it time Spielberg stopped making popcorn films and made something worthwhile? Yes indeed. The worst aspect is that the film has a very artificial look to it. All the explosions seem fake and the actors never seem to be giving it their full effort. Spielberg sure bombed out with this one.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
insurance issues,"Does an alien invasion count as an Act of God for insurance purposes? I say this having seen the new War Of The Worlds. Things really do look pretty messy and thats even before Tom Cruise gets round to fixing the window he broke with a baseball. Talking of breaking things, Spielberg's latest trial of destruction would probably be the years biggest hit if Lucas' Sith hadn't happened. WOTW has some absolutely monumental special effects and some spellbinding moments where you tip your hat to the old maestro: could some industry figure please explain how Spielberg worked the shot where the camera goes in and out and around the car Cruise's character is driving to Boston? Its a shot that may not be noticed by Joe Schmoe but it is as impressive as anything in the film. Other contributers have made useful contributions on these picture and I agree with them all. I do regret however that the film is less impressive when it slows down (it must do: you can't keep the mayhem going 24/7. Spielberg used to be able to do the quiet stuff better: one of the greatest moments in Jaws is Robert Shaws ghastly WW2 yarn. In particular I found the Tim Robbins role as pretty annoying: was it bumped up so a big name actor would have more to do. Nevermind, this is the real banana.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
War of the Worlds battles its way through family turmoil and extraterrestrial invaders.,"There was only one director that could adapt H.G. Wells' classic sci-fi novel and make it applicable for the current century. That man is Steven Spielberg. Not only has he made an exhilarating blockbuster intertwining many sub-genres into a sci-fi epic, but also allegorically addresses a society post-9/11. If only that underwhelming conclusion could've maintained the awe and suspense that the rest of the film breathed. The world is invaded by ""Tripod"" extraterrestrial machines that are exterminating the planet, where a father is dumped with his estranged children. This dysfunctional family must come together in order to survive.Forget about the colossal alien death machines, the real focus is on this broken family. A father attempting to reconnect with his children within the harsh extremities of an other-worldly invasion. It is during these difficult times that the children are susceptible to their father's authority and start to view him as a figure of leadership. They look up to him, and it gives him a chance to showcase his protective fatherly instincts. Substantial development from all individuals in this family that truly makes for some investing drama. Cruise gives a compelling performance, whilst also running for his life many times. Fanning, well, screams for the majority of the film. It's not her fault that her character is horrifically written, but it does leave her character insufferably irritating. The several lines of dialogue that relate to urban terrorism and several scenes relating to 9/11, particularly the plane crash, thematically presents a society adjusting to events that have changed the entire nation. Spielberg takes this and utilises it to enhance the modern perspective of Wells' novel, and it's effective. The visuals remain awe-inspiring, with the gigantic ""Tripods"" decimating cities, although some of the green screen was noticeable. Williams' score contains traces of Spielberg's classicism whilst crafting refreshing epic pieces of music, especially when the army are on the hill.But then we come to the ending, and it just feels so underwhelming given the chaos and fear that preceded it. It's a story about survival, so when these extraterrestrials struggle to survive themselves (despite the advanced technology they have acquired) it diminishes the plot. Is it a remark on current fatty consumerism? Or perhaps pollution? Humans have evolved to survive after thousands of years, able to coexist with the billion microbes that inhabit the planet. However after a day and night, these aliens just couldn't take it. Through all the colourful battles and horrific imagery, the film builds up to a promising final act but misses the mark almost completely. That's without mentioning how lucky Ray was. I mean he avoided death like ten times as he runs, drives or swims away from carnage.It's a shame that the ending is unfortunately underwhelming, as this is without a doubt one of Spielberg's most underrated and overlooked films within his extensive canon. Not the war that ends the world, but a dramatic battle nonetheless.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Tighten it for DVD,"First of all this is the best invasion flick there is...Okay I don't want to be Mister nay say, but there is just one thing that gave me a bad feeling after seeing this movie. The acting, oh it was just fine. Tom Cruise did quite a good job, but who really impressed me was Dakota Fanning.The special effects are great, the music score was excellent. The scenes, damn what a terrific work. Spielberg's unexpected surprise moments had certainly given their impact. Those moments made me think of surprise scenes like in Indiana Jones. So thats a good thing.Well the content of the movie. The plot, the story, now there we have the problem. There is no real strong plot. I don't care that there isn't much explaining about the aliens. Cause which doctor would be able to do a thorough scan on them right? But the missing of a good story, like about why they invade earth is a big disappointment.So Spielberg do me and all the other people who have mostly positive feelings about this movie, bring out a Director's Cut or Extended, Revised version of this movie on DVD. Make sure it has a strong plot.So folks if he does this, I think we have an great movie.

Very Good!!,"I can't understand why so many people hate this movie. I think it is the best movie about an alien invasion.

Who cares about the alien society and why they are invading the Earth? It doesn't matter! In the other movies the focus is on the reactions of the President of Unites States and is team, military,...

Close Encounters of the Unkind.,"Director Steven Spielberg's ode to the H.G. Wells classic novel is modernized to present-day New York City as dead-beat dad Tom Cruise tries to save himself and his two children (Justin Chatwin and Dakota Fanning) as alien beings attack in striking and frightening fashion, leaving total destruction and massive death tolls along the U.S. East Coast. Tense science fiction thriller that works due to Spielberg's excellent direction and out-of-this-world visual effects. The performers are adequate, but are not really the film's primary calling card. Tim Robbins has a short appearance as a bunkered survivalist who attempts to help Cruise and company. Robbins' part could be looked upon as an unnecessary distraction or a creative side-story to the production's happenings. Undertones aplenty here for educated viewers who are up to speed on affairs in the world today. Spooky narration by Morgan Freeman at the start and end is a smart way to let the audience know and understand where the film is going and has been. Would have been a disaster if not for a gifted film-maker like Spielberg. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Close Calls of the Spielberg Kind,"The planet Earth has been invaded countless times by marauding aliens who want nothing but the worst for us. It is a tale that plays to primal fears, but not all attempts have done it justice. The worst example is Ed Wood's unwatchable ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"", and the more recently gung-ho ""Independence Day"" was skewered by the comedic  if somewhat irritating - ""Mars Attacks"". Previously, HG Wells' novel caught the world's imagination, then caused mass panic in Orson Welles' 1938 radio broadcast and scared audiences of three generations in the 1953 film. Steven Spielberg takes the novel and obliterates the earth and buries the previous media incarnations while honoring the original work by the Grandfather of Science Fiction. However, things wind up just a bit too perfectly, and it leaves an indistinct but unpleasant aftertaste.Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) is a bitter man-child who works the loading docks of the New Jersey shore and works on car engines at his kitchen table. The resentment is mutual all around when his ex-wife (Miranda Otto) drops their kids (Rachel and Robbie played by Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin) off for the weekend. If nothing spectacular was to happen, they could be an intriguing group dynamic to watch, however, these three are the human lens through which we witness the alien invasion that begins with massive electrical storms and earthquakes from which piloted alien Tripods emerge and begin wreaking merciless devastation. The mass amounts of electricity cause electro-magnetic pulses, which short out every electronic device in the area, but Ray, Rachel and Robbie snag the one working car and barely escape. Over the coming days, they struggle against each other, the elements, the authorities, the aliens and what turns out to be the most unpredictable, other desperate survivors, in an attempt to reach some safe haven.No director has created as many summer blockbuster films as Steven Spielberg, and he clearly knows how to grab an audience. Everything that alien invasion films of the past have done wrong, he does right, or more correctly, doesn't even go near. There is no sky-borne fleet of ships reigning fire down upon world capitals or New York City. When the Tripods do emerge, they are frightening to see, and there are no glossy shots that might indicate an effects technician who draws the length of a shot out just to linger on an intricate monster. The effects are there to serve the tale and to terrify. The hero is a flawed and common man who has no real answers as to what is going on. His mission is not to save the world, but to save his family. This is in spite of the fact that he cannot seem to plan lunch, much less an escape route.John Williams' score is another element that is dialed down from all of his other collaborations with Spielberg. As one of the top Academy Award nominees and winners of all time, Williams has produced a wide variety of works, and the rousing marches to ""Star Wars"", ""Superman"" and the ""Indiana Jones"" series are among the most memorable. Here, Spielberg uses the music is used far more sparingly to create a mood more akin to ""Shindler's List"", and when the music comes in, it is only there for subtle reinforcement. Williams is saving his marches for another film, and succeeds in giving this film great undercurrents. Actually, the music sequence that sticks with you most afterwards is Ray's impassioned and tearful rendition of ""Little Deuce Coupe"" as he tries to sing Rachel to sleep.As harrowing as each situation is and as realistic as the obstacles in front of them appear to be, when ""WoW"" begins to pull to a close, Spielberg's intentions seem to become muddled. The story, at first, seems intent on telling an invasion tale using this family to show us what happens, and there is a natural shift to the subject of survival. But when the focus starts to shift to the family itself (and ultimately Ray's redemption in the eyes of his children) it goes a bit off the deep end. The one action-hero sequence is where the shift took place for me. (It's the scene with the hand grenades. I will say no more.) Tom Cruise's wonderfully crafted shell of desperation comes loose, and we get the guy who was clinging to the rear of a high-speed train and dodging bullets at the end of ""Mission: Impossible"", and we know he won't be allowed to fail. Although it isn't until late in the film, the suspense in the remaining scenes was gone for me, and I hate admitting that because the majority of the movie is just so damn good.This ""War of the Worlds"" is a magnificent invasion film that gets right what so many before have missed. Even with the transplanting of the story to 2005, this really does justice to the original 19th-century novel and remembers the much-respected 1953 film with a gracefully matched visual near the end. However, the ending and how it handles its characters created for this film all rings up a little too neatly. Although a suspense-laden, cliff-hanger, call-for-a-sequel end would not have been appropriate either, dispelling the hard atmosphere of desperation and misfortune with a glossed ending just doesn't ring true. There is too much ""E.T"" love and not enough ""Close Encounters"" unknown here. Morgan Freeman's narrator speaks of the human race carrying on, but it is the price paid by the people lost that those who survive  and those who are watching - should carry with them.7 out of 10 - even with the ending.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A 130 million + budget...but still not right!,"The good news is that this movie is worth a look and is watchable. In brief this is a science fiction film, and the earth is invaded by aliens intent on destroying the world or whatever.... The story centers on a family's struggle to survive the alien invasion and the adventures encountered when the lead character tries to take his two children away from the ""monsters"" and back to their mother who is in another part of the country. And sensible of the film makers to concentrate on ""ordinary people"" caught up in this rather than upon politicians, military leaders etc.The special effects are generally very good and it is that what makes the film viewable. However the bad news is: The main players are all obnoxious especially a screeching, screaming girl and too much of the story is taken up by the angst between the family members which I conclude is a reflection of the writers own family problems. And in any event the reason for this invasion is never explained, and the aliens with all their superior strength seem ultimately quite intellectually challenged. I read that the budget for this movie is 130 million dollars up, and its a pity a few bucks could not have been spent on creating some interesting non irritating characters or a half decent storyline. Nevertheless for the first rate special effects, it gets: 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Dark Vision of Invasion,"This is a pretty harsh look at what an alien invasion might be like. The brutality and horror of such an event is not sugar-coated here (except maybe for the ending, which I'll touch on later). It seems that Spielberg's Holocaust influence more than 9/11 was responsible for how terrible some of the images in this film are, but it made me appreciate the fact that Spielberg was willing to take what could have been another summer popcorn movie (like, yes, Independence Day) and instead made a strong statement about what genocide really means. There may even be a connection with current events in Africa.Maybe it's because I happen to be the divorced father of a 10-year old blond daughter myself, but I found this film to be more disturbing than some of the commenters. In fact I find some of their comments to be more glib and callous than insightful. Nothing Dakota Fanning did rang false to me, and many of the viewers (I guess because of their lack of life experiences) missed the point of a lot of the things that both the daughter and the father did. I am not a fan of Tom Cruise (his interview with Matt Lauer was one of the biggest displays of arrogant ego that I have ever seen in real life), but nothing he did in this film rang false, either. Real life is messy, folks, and in this case the film made the necessary connection with that real life in order to ground the fantastic nature of the film with true human emotions.Yes, the film has flaws. The ""Machines buried under the Earth for one million years"" plot device just doesn't work for me for multiple reasons (Why was H.G. Well's original concept of their simply coming down from space unacceptable for Spielberg?), and yes, the ending undercuts the tragic elements of the film -- although personally speaking, I only laughed because I recognized some familiar actors among the characters in the final scene.Still, this film is a worthy achievement, and by no means a failure of either film-making or vision. Although I must confess, I'll always prefer Close Encounters of the Third Kind myself.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Enjoyable for what it is.,"Clearly the reviews here have a tendency to lean very far one way or another with less middle ground.People who find fault with many obvious holes in the story are correct. But it is worth considering that many of those holes were given by the author of the story, Wells himself. Not the least of which was that this war of the worlds seems to have been fought and lost in one nation alone. A limited perspective from a man living in a nation that at the time was not unlike America that could see only its own significance in the world and little else.But Spielberg did introduce a few of his own. I myself had trouble getting past how Ray had rapidly, and remarkably, concluded that the pilots had come down in the lightning strikes into vehicles that must have been buried there. Concluded within minutes of the initial attack. Quite a good guess. No need to have been so awed when the woman reporter showed him a slow motion film confirming this.But I don't see any reason to nit pick the all facts. Any movie can be picked apart on facts and I just don't see the point of it. It's science fiction for crying out loud. How the heck to you do something so intentionally surreal with out contradicting reality? Wells wrote a story that was intended to impress on us these peoples feelings of fear, dread, helplessness and hopelessness. I remember reading it as a kid and really getting all of these message in Wells words. And the story allows us to understand that feeling of total despair only to find that a something totally unexpected and so seemingly small and insignificant can turn it all around.The movie in the 1950s was enjoyable and impressive. But it did not convey, so convincingly, Well's intended impressions as Spielberg's flick did. From the time that machine came out of the ground until the very end I was completely awe struck with those feelings. I still am, every time I watch it. Every time that thing comes out of the ground I think ""Holy s#!t!"" Every time I hear that sound I think that if I were there my thoughts could only be completely filled with only dread.Good job Steve. And I love how he did make the machines more like Well's tripods too!.Spielberg hit it right on the nail the was he always does.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Flaws Galore, but a Visceral Experience with Great Suspense","Even though ""War of the Worlds"" isn't a great film, after the first thirty minutes, the film is so damn tense and suspenseful I can't help but give this a solid recommendation even though it has quite a bit of flaws. The images and CGI are simply incredible and as good as special effects film-making can get. ""War of the Worlds"" really is nothing more than a purely survival narrative with little character development, which isn't too much of problem for me given the setting and everything that's going on. The ending was meh... a little pretentious and quite abrupt, but some of the scenes work so well, especially the scenes where Cruise and Fanning are stuck in the basement and the aliens are probing the area and there's this very long, prolonged search of the area, which takes this film to an extremely high level of film-making. It had me on the edge of my seat. The last ten minutes of the film is excessively rushed and quite bad, especially in comparison to previous hour and half, which is near perfection. The family waiting at the steps? They looked like they just had their morning tea and facial. Not a scratch or misplaced hair on their head. Just perms and smiles. I did recognize a bunch of head scratchers... like video cameras working, but nothing else, not even a wrist watch... people stopping and starring when something completely monstrous is coming out of the ground and ripping up the road underneath them, and a slew of others I wont mention so I don't ruin my own experience thinking about all the problematic areas of the film instead avoiding all the great aspects.The one glaring problem I have with it is the fact that everyone you think is going to live does. It tries to be too much of a crowd pleaser instead of the dark attack on the world it supposedly wants to be. It's way too optimistic with too much of a perfect little ending. ""War of the Worlds"" wasn't nearly dark enough for me in the final moments. Sci-fi is not my genre, but I really enjoyed so much of it that I can ignore some of the corny coincidences and generally forgettable acting from Cruise. The more you inspect the film, the more problems you'll find, but they're mostly in the opening and the ending moments. The majority of the film is taut and masterful film-making. As usual, a technically brilliant film from Spielberg, if nothing else.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Finds itself somewhere between ""Independance Day"" and ""Signs""","In the late 1990's, when movies like Independence Day and Armageddon became box-office hits, a certain romanticism was brought to the idea of cities being destroyed and countless lives being lost. As long as Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum and Ben Affleck eventually saved the day, it was fun. After 9/11, of course(!), audiences got a rude awakening. After that, movies such as The Core echoed through empty theatres and audiences gave The Day After Tomorrow the cold shoulder. I thought that M. Night Shalaman's Signs tapped into our real fears: the main characters were not witness to any destruction, but anxiously sat by the TV and radio to await further information regarding the terror around the world. This is something most audiences can relate to, since it's what millions of people did that tragic day in September, and even just a few days ago when London was attacked.Steven Spielberg's War of the Worlds somehow arrives in a zone that's not quite Independence Day, but not quite Signs, either. There are the big special effects sequences in which random citizens are killed, but there are also those quiet, sincere moments of a family living in fear, not knowing what to do, trying to survive. I didn't care as much for the family in War of the Worlds as I did for the family in Signs, though. Signs would still be an interesting movie without the aliens, but this movie wouldn't. We get the usual Speilbergian characteristics of a family, namely the deadbeat dad, played by Tom Cruise. I cared for the characters only because they're such a familiar breed and because we get about 20-30 minutes to get to know them and become accustomed to them. However, there's nothing all too unique about them.All that aside, War Of The Worlds is a truly frightening movie, which I think is the key. The world being destroyed is no longer fun, it's scary. There's something very nightmarish about this movie and it has a sense overwhelming fear and feeling of helplessness. There is only one scene that had me rolling my eyes, which was a ""tense"" sequence near the end of the movie which seemed to last well over ten minutes. At first it may have had me on the edge of my seat, but after being so drawn out, it just reminded me of how much better the raptor scene in Jurrasic Park was in comparison. But...oh well.My rating: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
War Of The Worlds A Decent Sci-Fi Remake,"War Of The Worlds is a decent sci-fi remake from director Steven Spielberg who continues to show his skill as filmmaker with this one despite it's flaws. The cast for the most part are good in their roles including Tom Cruise, Dakota Fanning, Justin Chatwin, and Tim Robbins. Miranda Otto makes a few brief appearances but like Robbins she doesn't get nearly enough screen time. Miranda Otto however is still effective with her cameo role in the movie. The rest of the cast are okay but no one stands out. The special effects are amazing especially the Tripods and the other aliens/machines that make brief appearances. The destruction left by the aliens is horrific showing audiences a war between humans and an advanced race of beings not from their world. The action is pretty intense and non-stop once the aliens make their presence known. The film may be a bit light on character development except for Cruise but the special effects and the action sequences make this remake worth seeing at least once. The pacing in between the action was a little slow at times and the film does leave a lot of questions unanswered which isn't really a bad thing I guess. Overall despite it's flaws though War Of The Worlds is a decent movie with intense action, great special effects, some suspense, and good performances by the cast who make this sci-fi remake worth the time to watch but it could have been a little better.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I had to mute the volume whenever she was on screen, just in case she started screeching without warning.Given that this film is now 20 years old, the special effects stand up well.

"Great action & suspense - mediocre acting, story and ending","The special effects are great. The horror of mass death and devastation is powerfully rendered and there are some incredibly suspenseful moments. Spielberg is still better at this than his imitators.But Cruise is miscast, and even though the film tries hard to build a credible family conflict, it just doesn't draw you in. Dakota Fanning is good, however, I don't think she overacted at all.There's not much variation from scene to scene: The same basic ""running & hiding from the tripods"" scenario plays out in a few different ways, and there's just the faintest trace of character development.The ending feels abrupt & the story incomplete.

Solid Alien Invasion For the Most Part,"When one of the greatest filmmakers in history makes a science fiction film, which is one of his biggest strengths, you have no choice but to check it out.War of the Worlds is loosely based on the H.G. Wells novel of the same name, about a father and his children trying to cope with a global alien invasion. There have been so many of these alien invasion films over the years, so it's difficult for any of them to feel fresh and stick out to me. I think the one thing that separates this film from others is that Tom Cruise or any of the other actors aren't playing characters that fight the aliens, or ""tripods"" as they call them. It only makes up a matter of a few days following the first attack and the immediate aftermath.Because of that, Cruise is given more to do dramatically than per usual. He gets a few stunts and an action scene or two (because why wouldn't you take advantage of his talent) but it's much more about family than it is about anything else. In that regard, the film works most of the time. Cruise plays Ray Ferrier, father to both Rachel and Robbie. Not to intentionally quote another Cruise movie, but it's really (k)night and day with these kids. Dakota Fanning is perfectly cast as Rachel, a pre-teen who is terrified of the apocalyptic world she now lives in. However, I just couldn't get behind Justin Chatwin's performance and the character of Robbie. There were too many times in which I either felt the character was entirely unnecessary to the plot, or he kept the plot from moving forward in frustrating ways. Why does he all of a sudden feel the need to leave his family and join the Army's fight against the tripods? Makes no sense whatsoever.Unsurprisingly, Spielberg's visual flare is probably the film's biggest asset. Whether it's the endless amount of long takes, explosive and visceral alien action, or the impressive CGI and green screen work, War of the Worlds is a gorgeous film to look at. If every aspect of the film was as good as the visuals, this could have been quite the adaptation. Bottom line, I like everything visually and some of the performances very much, but the last 20 minutes is a bit of a letdown, as is the constant annoyance of the Robbie character.+Visuals+Dakota is magnificent-Annoying older brother7.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Steven Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds""","I am a huge Steven Spielberg fan. To me, this film was never about special FX, how well it would do against Episode III, or Tom Cruise. I was just eager to see my idol's next project. He seemed excited to be doing it. All involved seemed excited too.And then something happened.Tom Cruise was jumping all over couches and spouting lessons of Scientology, people who loved Episode III became haters inadvertently, and audience members left the theaters disappointed at the abrupt ending, somehow forgetful of how the original literary material ends. And the attention to Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" detoured from a critique on the craftsmanship involved, to the silly circus of people around it.By all accounts, this film is excellent on many levels. The pacing is right on, the special FX are indeed superb, John Williams' score is a great parallel to the action on screen, and Spielberg again shows his knack for creating unforgettable images laden with emotion, horror, and pulse-pounding adrenaline.Although I personally feel that this film could've been so much more plot wise, I also feel that it redeems its' faults with its' plethora of virtues.Spielberg makes movies with his heart. It seems that some audience members are surprised at this. Some people may not like this film. Some may like it. But the fact of the matter is that one of the great director's of our era has composed a great summer blockbuster and more went right than wrong.If anyone should doubt Spielberg's elite place in the annals of the world of film, show me another filmmaker who has managed to stay on top for 30 years.Just Enjoy!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Nostalgic classic,"For me, as a kid born in '05, this film is a true classic. Huge explosions, a menacing alien invasion, and an overwhelming sense of hopelessness. The atmosphere created in this film is astounding.However, the second half is slow on rewatch. It presents the insanity a desperate humanity faces at this time, just in a unengaging and drawn out fashion.In contrast to some other reviews, I find the ending to deliver a certain feeling. Typically the aliens would be terrifying and intimidating, yet they're tiny and almost otherwise unassuming. Yet they caused so much devastation. Furthermore, life on earth, something we take for granted, is much more complex and dangerous then we realise.

A great invasion drama!,"Despite having heard 'not-too-good' comments about this movie from my friends, i actually found it very entertaining! The movie starts out showing Tom Cruise as a negligent and careless father Ray Ferrier, and it works!! As Earth gets invaded (and my God, this must be the scariest, most ruthless Earth invasion i've ever laid my eyes upon in movies), we start to see Ray Ferrier's character evolving into a warm, caring father. What makes this movie work so well is that not only we are given superb visuals of Mass Destruction, but also a very involving drama of a family struggling for survival. The CGI are used to good effect, and the scenes are so full of suspense and haunting sense of extermination, it becomes scary! Perhaps my only gripe of the film is the title. Not that it's bad or anything, but ""War Of The Worlds"" gives us the impression that this is indeed an ""epic battle"" of aliens vs. humans, when it is in fact, the tale of a family desperately trying to survive a ruthless extermination. Though the movie does suck me in most of the time, towards the end, the way the movie ends is just a bit too... drastic, and when the movie does end... well, i don't want to spoil anything here, but you can't shake off the feeling of cliché at the very end.But, all in all, a very enjoyable movie. The thrills and buildups, once given away, may not be as engrossing to make us watch it many many times, but for that one sitting, needless to say, i really enjoyed War Of The Worlds.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

SF Classic Gets a Modern Treatment,"A great pop-corn munching movie, worth seeing for the special effects alone, but don't go looking for any deep meaningful insights into the human condition....There are some wonderful special effects here, warfare (or extermination?) on a massive scale, great lumps of heaving technology, weird alien creatures, endlessly screaming children, buttock-clenching moments of sheer terror, and even some of those ""didn't I see that in another movie?"" kind of moments, and the film rocks along at such a cracking pace and you don't notice that that it is all empty, meaningless fluff.The film sticks closely to the book -- even though it is set in the WRONG COUNTRY MR Spielberg -- though Well's pontifications on colonial imperialism gets dumped in favour of vaporizing bodies.A lot of critics here seem to be hung up on the peanut butter sandwich sticking to the window when it shouldn't, but any fool can see that it is a reflection we are looking at...a reflection of Tom Cruise the self-centred father, who is in turn a reflection of OURSELVES as modern man with our modern self-centred way of life, who are about to be exterminated like ""moggots"" by and even more self-centred species, and er... so on.

"Steven Spielberg's rendition of H.G. Wells's classic novel scores for a thrilling, if flawed experience","For the past few decades, Steven Spielberg has been an expert at crafting both inspiring and riveting stories into outstanding cinematic pieces. Sprawling across nearly every genre in the book, Spielberg has proved to be gifted with a hefty hand with mesmerizing storytelling, engrossing characters, and for science-fiction entries, flashy special effects. His tour de force style of filmmaking explodes on screen in this dark, atmospheric alien-invasion thriller inspired loosely off the pages of H.G. Wells's acclaimed novel. With many liberties taken from the source material including giving the lead character a name and being a divorced father of two, Spielberg takes heavy inspiration from the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks to generate an intense, disaster-esque alien invasion thrill ride with a more heart-throbbing direction than many other alien flicks like Roland Emmerich's 'Independence Day'. And the main star of the chaotic thrill ride is Tom Cruise who's collaborating with Spielberg for the second time following their first adventure together in cyberpunk thriller 'Minority Report' which took from the pages of Phillip K. Dick's novel of the same name. This film follows a Brooklyn dock worker Ray Ferrier (played by Tom Cruise), a divorce father who's set look after his ten-year old daughter Rachel (played by Dakota Fanning) and sixteen-year old son Robbie (played by Justin Chatwin) for a week. Upon their visit, the city of Brooklyn suddenly attacked by an army of alien tripods that mysteriously arrived from the sky. Fleeing in Ray's van, the family sprawls on a cross-country trip in efforts to reunite the children's mother Mary Ann (played by Miranda Otto) while fighting vigorously to arrive against the extraterrestrial invasion.Steven Spielberg is no stranger to stories dealing with extraterrestrial invasion when looking at his work in 'Close Encounters of The Third Kind' and 'E.T'. Unlike those entries, Spielberg ventures on the more bleak side of alien encounters that fully defies the friendly portrayal of extraterrestrial lifeforms as shown in the latter. Focusing firmly on the ground-level survival of a family rather than a series of spaceships battles demonstrated on 'Independence Day', Spielberg rarely pulls any punches when portraying the horror of the chaos and pays fair inspiration from the 9/11 attacks, which is firmly demonstrated in a shot with Tom Cruise's character looking in the mirror tattered in dust and rubble from head to waist. From the opening minutes of the aliens' arrival, the story plunges into a grim, tension-heavy atmosphere where the lives of our main characters are in grave danger and innocent lives blasted into clouds of dust by alien laser beams. And it is all frightening to sit through. These sequences are blissfully crafted together with a hodgepodge of explosive special effects and clean-cut CGI. The story, which follows a largely divergent trajectory from H.G. Wells, advances at a solid pace but hits a major speed bump during a scene with Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning's creepy encounter with a mentally crazed man in a basement cellar, played by Tim Robbins. This scene marks easily one of the biggest weakpoints, with other being the anti-climatic ending which slams the door on the story in a ludicrously lazy manner, as if the writers suddenly ran out of ideas. Though the film effectively sets stone a firmly thrilling experience, it is left with a burnt fuse during its conclusion. In final words, Tom Cruise exercises a fine, though slightly inconsistent performance. Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin stand solid in the underage roles, nothing more, nothing less.War of The Worlds is a compelling rendition of H.G. Wells's classic source material that scores for a thrilling, if flawed experience.

Wow could this have been worse?,"Having seen this film I too want to get in a tripod, load the death rays and go on a rampaging orgy of slaughter around the World. It stunk like a dying Martian.How anyone as talented as Spielberg and with a budget larger than the GDP of a pacific island could excrete such a pile of steaming manure is beyond me. I knew Cruise's acting would have its usual emetic effect, how could it be otherwise? I wish cinemas would provide airline sick bags at his films, heavens - they must know by now. The acting? well, lets not grace it with that term, lets call it ""doing stuff from a plot script in front of a camera"", less pithy perhaps but more accurate. When someone says acting I think of Gielgud or Orson Welles, but then I'm old-school. Can no-one have a conversation in a Hollywood film by talking normally to each other anymore? Do they all have to degenerate into emoting over any inane event? Does Cruise's little girl put in a situation of stress have to be shown in hyper-ventilating hysteria to convey emotion. Does everyone have to EMOTE, AT FULL VOLUME, ALL THE TIME? Jesus. Over the top, hammy and inept. And from Spielberg of all people.The film could have been so so good if they'd stripped out the schmaltzy mawkish family values sentimentality seen in every film nowadays. The clichéd separated father struggling with his kids for their love and respect. arggggghhhhh!!! Give me **** break.The special effects were galling ILM excellence. Galling because they showed what the film could have been. There are shocking and disturbing scenes of a tripod using a cage basket of live captive humans as a ""snack-as-you-walk"" holder, a fleshy sphincter, and Martians using a hypodermic for drinking humans. Quite gross but exactly the sort of thing I hoped would push a 2005 film of the book to cinematic excellence rather than mere cash till bait. Instead we saw nearly nothing of the Martians, little of the military as in the HG Welles original book. No explanation of Martians, expansion of their motives, exploration of their personality or struggles with the moral dilemmas of ravaging the Earth? None was explored: presumably there was no running time left after mr Cruise EMOTING and saving his family.At no time was there a sense of universal catastrophe. We heard at one stage: ""Europe got wiped out"" and that was it. Australia? Russia? South America? Not a mention not a single scene. I guess no-one in Idaho would be interested so why bother. This was no so much a film about a global apocalypse, but more one of ""Martians go to Boston for a stag night, behave badly and get sick the morning after.""Really don't waste your money, if you're a masochist wait for xmas when your cousin who really hates you will buy it for you.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Amazing,"Wow. That's what I said after this movie was over. War of the Worlds is one movie that you MUST see this summer. I'm sure you all know about the plot. Aliens invade, wanna kill us, all that jazz. Now that's all been done before (Independence Day for example), but this isn't about the aliens coming and blasting us to kingdom come. It's about the characters. The sheer terror they go through. I was literally on the edge of my seat with my pulse quickened during several scenes. You see exactly what the characters see, which draws you in more and more into their experiences with the alien Tripods.The acting was pretty good for this movie. As usual, Tom Cruise did an awesome job, and Dakota Fanning was perfect. Everyone else did a good job as well.This movie is not perfect by any means, but it is a very great movie, worthy of anyone to see. Many parts are open-ended, so the viewer can interpret them in the way he or she wants. As I said earlier, you see what the characters see. So you might not know during the movie why the aliens are here and their motives. It requires you to think, which I think is a good thing. Too many movies hand out every little detail on a silver-platter, and everything not explained is dubbed a ""plot-hole."" This movie has no plot-holes, it requires you to think.All in all, this film was terrific, worthy of seeing twice in theaters. It's a horror movie with aliens. Scary aliens with big, nasty, walking death-machines. And they're already here.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good film,not great; almost sullied by needless publicity stunts","I must admit that the main culprits of this film are not the ones at fault--if there is any--if this film has leaks and shortcomings,which I feel like it does have just enough to cut into its value. Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise for their parts do what is fully right and necessary to make this remake of the 1953 movie and 1938 radio play effective,entertaining and disturbing.To be brutally honest,I've been less than thrilled with the idea of Cruise and Spielberg,both monster egos each,TEAMING to do a movie. Again. Then the three month long publicity crapfest that led up to the show,mostly revolving around Tom Cruise and his love for Katie Holmes(no comment there) and his ""crusade"" for America's children(read:his crusade for Scientology). Add to that,Paramount/Dreamwork's refusal to screen the movie in advance,and I was less than receptive to the idea of adding my $6 to this. Enough good word from people I knew who saw it and reviewers caused me to cave in.I think I can say I'm mostly glad I did. Strip away some of the more gruesome images,and this film is basically a long ""Chase movie"". Dockworker and delinquent dad Ray Ferrier(Cruise) is left alone with his kids while his ex-wife goes up to Boston to be with her folks. Wouldn't ya know it,the alien(Martian perhaps?) tripod destructo-battle ships emerge from the ground and proceed to vaporize and squash everything that runs THAT VERY day. Ray takes his kinder(DAkotah Fanning,the hardest working grade-schooler in showbiz,and Justin Chatwick) and makes a run to Boston,but not without,eh...ahem,problems. Tim Robbins is thrown into the mix(and steals his scenes) as a rapidly deteriorating(mentally)survivor.This film has no fewer than five logistic and continuity gaps,and it is rife with all the Spielberg trademarks of emotional button-jamming through imagery,but it is still effective and worth a look if(and this is a BIG IF)you're up for it,and not everyone will be.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Its really good with some small issues,"I have watched this movie a few times and have always found it entertaining.The story we know is a classic and this delivers a more than adequate version of the tale.Where it struggles a little is with 2 things. 1 I have watched a few different versions of the film and they all look horrible, they have an unpleasant glare and sometimes slightly blurry look, it does diminish the film.2. It has Tom Cruise in it and that is not a complaint necessarily about TC, I enjoy most of his movies, but you always see TC he never disappears into the character (he is not alone with this problem).Having said that I like the feel and the pace of the movie it carries a great sense of urgency that puts you in-touch with the characters.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Great, while it lasts!","One of Spielbergs weaker films, yet amazing in many ways. In a nutshell this is worth seeing because of it's style, special effects, and buttock clenchingly high levels of tension and engagement.Spielberg hiccuped on a few areas; the most common complaint arising from a major technical detail that contradicts the continuity (one phantomly powered video camera sort of brings down his empire for a minute) while others are the consequence of re-making an already clunky finish: yet passing such quick judgment on an inherently abrupt ending feels a little foolish - and I must defend that there is still plenty on offer here, almost enough to make up for it, almost.There was also a lot less war in the film than I had anticipated (a lot more running and hiding, and a little girl screaming). But if we can grudgingly accept Spielberg's chosen perspective of the war - through the eyes of our pedestrian Cruize and his pair of wriggling children, we can accept his vision for this film. Once we're over that hurdle we can realize that his skills are still razor sharp. Indeed Spielberg delivers everything we expected and more on an epic scale and it is the story, not the presentation that flounders. This film feels fresh and bold, satisfying our hunger for new levels of realism and tension.A panoramic montage of the human race with a reading of part of Well's novel by Morgan Freeman is both obligatory and begrudgingly necessary as an opening sequence, but the true butterflies finally take flight only once the next sequences create a working class situation, in a sagging New Jersey dockland. Not too long and a storm starts a-brewin' and we, nervously begin to realize what Spielberg is about to do with this very real place and (notably) post 9/11 people. For me there was uneasiness about of what I was about to see - Spielberg has been known to disturb with the brutality of realism and the way he was playing it, I got the feeling that this was going to be one of those times. You just don't exactly know how it's all going to happen, and you feel very much on the street, as the first tripods emerge.When he finally releases the tension, it hits hard and fast. What happens is quite incredible and disturbing as our audience's gasps tended to agree (not conventionally gruesome, just unusual and a bit frightening). The ball was rolling, and doesn't stop until said ending. Yes, this is a classic Spielbergian study in tension building and the release of terror, with no mistaking the quality of the effects or intensity of the action. Blammo!Cruize's necessarily fast development into a more dedicated dad is alright - but it's his childish, selfish dysfunction and his struggle to care about his responsibilities as a week-end father that really holds the most interest and humour for us - indeed most of the actors shine pre-invasion.Of style? It's a feast for the eyes and imagination. For much of the film, the ""money shots"" of the alien machines are masterfully obscured by dust, debris or clouds - we have to look hard to make out their shapes and dimensions. I read somewhere that Spielberg's intention was to give you a similar perception of events to what we had on Omaha beach; hand-held at eye level, the camera desperately glancing back as we run for cover. The effect is that we catch incidental (yet deliberate) glimpses of people being incinerated, the alien machines as they emerge, and the shock and intensity of their assault. Notably, the action is rarely presented to us outside of these subjective angles and the result is a terrifyingly immersive experience, giving the director a connection to us that allows him to shock and jolt us at his leisure. We get to witness Spielberg's ever developing genius as he plunges us into greater depths of realism.I saw this in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada, and my wife will tell you it was the location of the quickest mid-movie toilet break ever.My verdict: Not the strongest of stories, running out of steam too early, yet presented with undeniable skill. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An entertaining summer movie with  many questions unanwered,"First off, this was a solid movie. I'm a fan of Spielberg, but a few of his current movies are below par. I did enjoy Minority Report which was really entertaining (ending could of been better). I really didn't want to see it because of Tom Cruise's behavior but whenever Spielberg is directing you will most likely be entertained.There are a lot of questions that might go through your mind which I'm sure every critic is talking about right now. I agree of what my friends say: ""You can use your imagination to intepret these answers for yourself"". I guess that's OK but some of the questionable plot holes become annoying (especially for sci-fi fans and people that want explanations for everything).The characters were likable. The acting was good. The special effects were very entertaining. Spielberg did a great job portraying the human emotion of this event.I wish the ID4 team could of teamed with with Spilberg's team (with Spielberg directing) and could of made a great sci-fi alien takeover movie with a lot of believable emotion (which ID4 lacked).This is a good movie to see in theatres with all the special effects. This is a definite guilty pleasure (7 stars).",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

B-Movie Blockbuster does exactly what it says on the tin!,"Steven Spielberg's latest blockbuster is a tour-de-force of entertainment and the latest special effects, which despite it's shortcomings in the substance department, still works thanks to the amazing effects, good plot pace and high entertainment value on the whole. The film is, of course, based on the classic novel 'War of the Worlds' by H.G. Wells' and is a remake of the 1953 film of the same title. The film follows a similar structure to that of most disaster movies, in that it follows two plot lines; the first being the major disaster itself, and the second being the smaller tale of an estranged family unit. Spielberg never truly manages to garner the maximum effect from either story. Sure, the effects are amazing and when the aliens are attacking, you wont care about much else; but he grounds the story in minute details too often, and the story of Tom Cruise and his estranged kids just isn't enough to form a solid backbone for the movie. Adding to the woe on this front is the chemistry between the actors; of which there isn't a lot. I realise that it's supposed to be an estranged relationship, but really; the three central characters could have been strangers.However, nobody will pay admission to War of the Worlds for the accompanying story, and it's the overblown special effects that steal the show and are the real star of the film. I'm not usually one to rave about CGI, but the effects really are something to rave about. As cars fly across the screen and underground tremors give way to huge mechanical monstrosities, it's impossible not to be entertained and it goes to show that all these years Spielberg has spent making popcorn have made sure that he knows how to give the audience what they want. The alien attack sequences in this movie are the reason people go to the cinema. The story of the family at the centre of the movie is typically Spielberg, and it shows a father whose kids live with their mother and call him Ray instead of Dad. The family really just gives Spielberg some characters to spin the action around, but he does manage to squeeze some credibility out of this plot. As it plays out, we can engage more and more with the characters and despite their lack of chemistry; Spielberg wins us over with them in the end.Tom Cruise isn't an actor that I rate very highly. While he has screen presence and charisma, he lacks acting talent and in this film, like many other films of his, he seems to simply be playing himself. It's lucky, then, that this film is an effects laden blockbuster; because if it was an actor's film; Cruise would bring the project down without question. He is joined by the latest child-actor craze; Dakota Flemming. Actually, this young actress isn't nearly as annoying as many of her counterparts and she delivers a solid performance in the film. Justin Chatwin makes up the threesome. I'd never heard of this actor before, and it's not surprising since he's hardly made anything. I liken his performance in this movie to that of the kids' in Jurassic Park - decent enough at the time, but forgettable by the end. Spielberg's direction is, of course, solid throughout and although he's not the most talented director to ever sit in the director's chair, popcorn is what he's good and when he's making it, you can usually count on a good time. Unless it's called Schindler's List, of course.The ending of 'War of the Worlds' has always seemed like something of a cop-out to me. It's one of the things I hated about the original movie, but thanks to Morgan Freeman's outro; the ending is wrapped up nicely and it even seems to make sense. Spielberg still manages to cop-out on us with the ending to his other plot, however; which is far too soppy and spoils the most powerful moment that the film offered. But on the whole; War of the Worlds does exactly what you would expect it to do. It offers solid entertainment, some great special effects and not a lot else. I had a really good time watching it and the film most definitely built on my expectations. A highly recommended summer blockbuster.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good Movie, but doesn't live up to the hype.","An H.G Wells Sci-fi classic brought the to the big screen by Steven Spielberg, what could be more anticipating? It's very different to the book, but the content and plot are pretty much the same.Modern Day America. Tom Cruise is Ray Ferrier, a recently divorced engineer. His wife (Miranda Otto, LOTR's Eowyn) is leaving his kids with him for a few days Robbie (Justin Chatwin) and Rachel (The brilliant Dakota Fanning). After an electrical storm, all is calm, until the classic Tripods emerge from deep underground and begin to slaughter the people of Earth. As the 'Intruders' continue to plough their way across the country, Ray and his kids must fight for survival.The film has some amazing sequences and there is a constant heavy atmosphere. Spielberg truly creates a sense of, 'Would would you do in this situation?' This movie makes people not want to believe in Aliens. The movie also shows urgency of other characters and doesn't just focus on the main characters. The performances were good all round, especially by the scene-stealing Tim Robbins. But the thing that let this movie down apart from some obvious gaping plot-holes, is the fact that the characters weren't easy to relate to and you didn't really mind what happened to them.Overall, the movie DIDN'T live up to the hype.

One of the worst films I have ever seen,"Spielberg has a liking for weak, self-centred individuals who somehow come good. And Tom Cruise's weak and pathetic central character in this dreadful film says acres about the director.If it weren't enough to saddle a science fiction classic with a self-centred idiot as its slacker hero, the film wreaks havoc on H. G. Wells original story and fills it with irrational and illogical behaviour patterns. No one in this film acts in a normal or believable way. We have entered an insane asylum where the lunatics are performing some kind of morality tale.The film's characters lack definition, and have no consistency in their actions. All the characters scream a lot, panic and lack any human decency, which is what most of Spielberg's characters always do.The film also manages a flip pro-military salute with the son's abandonment of family values to go fight the invading aliens.Shame on you Mr. Spielberg - go get a story teller to write your next epic and spare us from any more losers as heroes.Leave well alone and watch the superior George Pal original with gene Barry.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great summer blockbuster - but nothing more,"I read somewhere that Spielberg is incompetent of bad film-making... and its true! But then again, this is not his best film as it ""scores"" far from Jaws, Jurassic Park etc.I think people were disappointed by the movie and other people will definitely be after seeing it due to the fact of the over-hyped grant promotion that it got because Cruise and Spielberg are the 2 most powerful men in Hollywood. They over-promoted the film because they want to make money - Hollywood is a business at its core - its money-driven and not artistically-driven.Spielberg - as I wrote at the first sentence of this comment - cannot make a bad film... W.O.W. is great technically: great sound and visual effects that are realistic, satisfactory acting but a mediocre script and maybe a bad adaptation from the book does not push the film to classic status (i.e 9 or 10 rating) but it goes up to 7 or 8 rating.Previously I used the term ""mediocre script"" and I would like to explain: the movie is filled with little silly ""convienences"" that are very distracting if you are awake at the time of watching the film and of average intelligence. For example: how is the car of Ray Ferrier (Cruise) still in one piece when he comes out of his wife's basement (everything else is destroyed).Other flaws of the film are the few unexplained pieces of the plot: i.e was Ray Ferrier the cause of the fall of the alien's shield? and, why are the aliens spraying blood all over the show? Somebody could argue that the ending is also a flaw but for those who know the book probably didn't mind it.... I actually found it interesting but I think its a bit too sudden and generally out of the pace of the whole film.All in all, I know I gave a big list of flaws above but this movie is so well crafted that it still manages to score a 7 rating from me.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Closer to the Book,"I have a very fond place in my heart for George Pal's The War of the Worlds made during the golden age of science fiction. I was somewhat apprehensive upon hearing a remake was in the works, but many of my fears were allayed hearing the film would be directed by none other than Stevin Spielberg. Well, overall, this remake was a quality film yet I have some ambivalent feelings toward it. Spielberg does what he does best: lots of great suspense and solid storytelling, awesome, state-of-the-art special effects, wonderful music by John Williams, and an outwardly satisfying film...for the most part. Actually, this film was somewhat of a letdown for me. Now before you misunderstand, I did think it was a decent film. It was definitely much closer to the spirit of the book. The special effects...WOW! When you see the spaceships and the Martians, they look stunning and horrifying. I also like the way that Spielberg stays in touch with the common man rather than, say the president ala Independence Day(a film I ultimately enjoyed more). What I didn't take to was the kids as protagonists again...a typical Spielberg device but one that really doesn't work nearly as well in this film. Dakota Fanning as Rachel does a serviceable job in a rather stereotypical role as the frightened out of her wits pre-adolescent. Justin Chatwin; however, as the obnoxious, rebellious teen at odds with a father he feels antipathy for is far less satisfying. I didn't like the kid at all. Tom Cruise is acceptable at best...and really that is rather generous. Spielberg might have added a bit more depth to these characters. And I really am puzzled at Spielberg's use of the two stars from the original Pal film: Gene Barry and Ann Robinson. If you blink, you will miss them. They are not even on screen three seconds. C'mon Steve. Couldn't you give them just a bit more screen time? With what they have, you might have well not used them at all.But these acting concerns aside for a film effects oriented, this remake is a quality film but definitely not one of its director's best.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Onto the movie though, as a science fiction freak, I have seen the original War of the Worlds, and love the older more original films. That being said, most remakes don't usually make my cut, but this one I think does. It is fast paced and easily followed. The Tripods are awesome and terrifying, and the martians themselves...well they look a lot different from what you would expect. Its a great film to watch while having pizza with friends, but it also really makes you think too. What kind of creatures must exist out there in the open universe? Its also highly ironic and frightening to know that, as with anyone who is familiar with the story will tell you, they truly are indestructible.

Makes INDEPENDENCE DAY look like the Fourth of July.,"My Take: A terrifying and exciting version of the classic H.G. Wells tale. Possibly the best version.(This is an extension of the review I wrote in April 2007)Unlike his ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial"", Spielberg's adaptation of H.G. Wells WAR OF THE WORLDS doesn't give a peaceful message of aliens being friendly to earth's beings. The aliens here are, to all those familiar with Wells' story (And most thankfully, most are), hostile and couldn't think of any other reasons to land here on Earth, but to destroy it. While WAR OF THE WORLDS might be geared as entertainment, bringing Spielberg back in his days with JAWS and JURASSIC PARK. But upon mastering his skills as a more serious filmmaker in SCHINDLER'S LIST and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, he makes WAR OF THE WORLDS a much darker experience, making it more effective and more frightening. Spielberg shares Wells' vision in a tale of an invasion on earth by emotionless aliens. This is thrill-master Spielberg at his best.The camera focuses mainly on Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) and his family, who are forced to leave their home, and run for their lives after an gigantic tripod emerges from the soil and destroy everything in its path. The films plot, thankfully, didn't burst into an all-out war that pits man and aliens in the ultimate war. Like what Tim Robbins' character says, ""This is not a war when there's a war between man and maggots... This is an extermination."" That's some of the elements that actually elevate this from other alien invasion films. ""Independence Day"" or ""Mars Attacks!"" per say.From the first frame to the last, I think it was a wonderful film. The flaws are there, but in favor mind-blowing entertainment and sheer terror, I won't hold them against the film. The special effects on the tripod machines are impressive, not because the CGI is top-notch, but that because how effectively ominous they are. These tripods join the shark from JAWS and the Raptors from JURASSIC PARK as yet another perfect killing machine as only Spielberg could create. If this is not the best adaptation of Wells' classic tale, it's definitely the most frightening. WAR OF THE WORLDS is terrific entertainment.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Spectacular, non-stop action","The classic tale gets a fresh new look thanks to dynamic visuals. This is still one of Tom Cruise's best performances (in my opinion) and Dakota Fanning is also very good.The visuals are jaw-dropping.

This is non-stop action and excitement from beginning to end, with lots of suspense and great sound effects.Yes, there were scenes when I thought this is absolutely not possible, and it wasn't always believable how Ray (Cruise) managed to escape the onslaught, but in general this is one hell of an awesome action thriller. Spielberg thought of everything to maximize the suspense. 'War of the Worlds' is a an all-round top-notch production.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This movie REALLY sucked.,"There is not cohesive plot. Tom Cruise's character is a moron with no redemption value at all as a human being.

Many Holes And Flaws But Still Entertaining,"This film has a pretty bad rap and it's understandable why. Starting with the alien ships being previously buried which makes no sense, contradicts the resolution and defeats the whole point of the film in a way. Following it are a series of inexplicable decisions and events that don't add up and the annoying kids of Cruise's character. The movie discards with the storyline of a scientist and the military working to fight the aliens and focuses on an individual story. Which is alright if they didn't burden it with so much personal drama.Yet for all its issues it doesn't waste much time to get going and there's almost constant action of some sort.

Entertaining,"Hadn't seen this in years. I remember really enjoying it, but I found it to be a mixed bag this time around, though it's more good than bad. None of it is actually bad, but the second half drags a bit and the ending is Hollywood lame followed by some narration explaining the ending. Technically, it is stunning. The CGI is relentless and it all works with only one shot that I noticed not looking perfect. The first half is very exciting and even in the weaker second half, it's not dull. No one in it is bad, but there are no great performances either. The centerpiece is, of course, Tom Cruise. He's a movie star who's comfortable in front of a camera, but he is seldom anything other than Tom Cruise, which is not such a terrible thing as it usually works, but I had some issues with a few not very authentic attempts at trying to move us emotionally. All in all, it's fine entertainment by a terrific director though here it's Spielberg with a touch of Roland Emmerich and/or Michael Bay.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Entertaining, Gripping and Well Done","I wasn't sure what to expect when I sat down in the theater to watch this movie. I had not heard of the H.G. Wells work, which this movie is based on, before seeing the movie and the trailer and previews don't tell you much, as well the should not or really cannot do so and stay true to the movie. After the first half hour of the movie I found myself totally drawn in, gripped, entertained and somewhat scared.I don't think I am really spoiling it for anyone by saying that this movie is about an alien invasion of earth, but not really ""about"" an alien invasion of earth. If you are going into the movie expecting an ""Independence Day"" style plot and movie you will be badly disappointed. By this I mean don't expect a plot that slowly reveals the sci-fi facts about why the aliens are here, what do they want, how does their technology works, how we can defeat them etc. In fact by the time you leave the movie there will probably be several unanswered questions about the science (fiction) of the whole thing and about how the plot comes to a resolution, but if you just take it easy and just allow yourself to be drawn into the movie and emotionally connect with the Tom Cruse and Dakota Fanning characters, you will leave the theater very pleased.The movie has great action, Excellent special effects and truly terrorizing sound and ambiance effects of the alien invasion, but the subtle, entertaining and gripping element of the movie isn't really the ""war"", violence or a man vs. alien struggle, it is the fight to survive at all costs.Tom Cruse's performance was great and Dakota Fanning did a particularly impressive job. Tim Robins also gave a very good and convincing performance in his small role. The cinematography and camera movements were more fluid than the average movie and just ""different"", but in a good way. In fact I think this was one of the main reasons I got drawn into the movie so much. Don't expect a thick complex plot or a well-formulated ending because you are not going to get it. I was very very amazed at how well the movie came across and how entertaining it was despite the weak plot.Many people will probably be disappointed because they had the wrong the expectation walking into the movie. If you liked the movie ""Signs,"" and found yourself absorbed by the terror of the movie and entertained by the subtle back-story aspects of it, you will probably enjoy this movie even more. Not that I am not trying to compare ""War of the Worlds"" to ""Signs,"" because they are in fact very different, but if you got that movie and enjoyed it you will probably enjoy this a lot more, and if you didn't get it you should probably stay away from ""War of the Worlds,"" or at least keep an open mind when you go to see it.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Great special effects,good re-telling of the story.","Tom Cruise proves again and again he can act, but Dakota Fanning steals the show from him in this one, she is brighter then the effects in this movie.The story is a good take on the classic ""war of the worlds"" tale, concentrating more on the humans and never visiting the ""why"" of the aliens in much detail.The special effects are awesome and really add to the movie, I loved the opening sequence when we first see the invaders...wow.This is Steven Spielberg so you know all production values are high bar and that is all that needs to be said there.This is a fun exciting and only in one spot a bit silly (the Tim Robbins bit) movie.I highly recommend it to any sci-fi fans.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
War of the Worlds,"War of the Worlds, a sci-fi world ending epic that manages to make a compelling thrill through it's first half. With some brilliant set up and acting, it's one to watch for sure. If only it was more refined towards the latter half.Directing. Spielberg nails it and pulls off a somewhat nostalgic look, that current day 2024 is trendy back, grainy, glowy, grungy. It's quite a ''dirty'' looking movie especially outside daytime scene are gritty. And it adds a darkness over the overal impending events, but also a instant nostalgia for current times, like a dream. Either way the color grade was great. And the CGI, wel, knowing Spielberg I should've known he would make it almost look timeless, and for a movie from 2005, wow, it's pretty much perfect. I'm not even sure if a movie in 2024 would look better, maybe some minor shots, but the CGI is incredible. This goes to sell the whole events in the movie. Pacing is fine, with some great set pieces. But, the basement scene falls prey to being overextended and lacks the thrill to maintain focus. It basically repeats a scenario and as a viewer it's not engaging.Characters and story, imo the major flaw of this being rewatchable or a even greater movie. The dynamic is fine, and it's mostly tolerable, but it's function just really is to annoy the viewer more than give the main character a reason to change. It doesn't effectively influence character choice and development. And thus leaves us with that ''annoying teen'' because ultimately it doesn't matter. Ray Ferrier is still the same after everything. Second is the story, let's just say the resolution to the problem is one of the most underwhelming moments I've seen in such a big movie. And the problem mostly lies in it's directing and set-up of it in my opinion. Because sure, I get it, but the way it's done and shown. How could this be satisfying for anyone, and IF that's how you do it, then you need a much stronger character story to fill that gap. Sadly neither happened.Music and sound design, good music, sound design is great but will blow your ears out, I'm okay with loud, but especially the first city scenes the sounds are just sharp in their loudness.Still had a good time, well acted nonetheless, but missed potential.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
created on a lavish scale but the script is lacking,"The Cruise-Spielberg team that brought audiences Minority Report return for this big budget sci-fi saga about a working-class father and his two estranged children who must band together and fight for their survival after Earth is invaded and overrun by tripod war machines on a mission to exterminate the human race. With shades of Independence Day the film is well-crafted, suspenseful, and at times exciting, but the script leaves too many questions unanswered and never really delivers the way you'd hope for. Starts with a bang and works well as a thrill ride likely to please action fans, but those looking for a fresh, inventive sci-fi feature probably won't be impressed. Hats off to the special effects crew, and watch for Tim Robbins who undoubtedly has the film's best role. **½",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An 'Out Of This World' Movie,"Spielberg's version of the H.G. Wells classic 'War Of The Worlds' is really good and scary, but nothing like the book. I think Spielberg changed it's genre from 'Sci-Fi' to 'Horror'. But, once again, like he does with all his scary movies, Spielberg scared me again. I found that the originality in this movie was very high (except for the actual aliens). Those giant three-legged spaceship thingies were awesome. The acting was very good, starring Tom Cruise (Jack Reacher, Oblivion) and Dakota Fanning (Man On Fire, Coraline). I haven't seen the original movie, 'The War Of The Worlds', so I can't say this is better. All I know is that this movie is very scary, and, for you Sci-Fi-horror fans out there, I recommend this movie to YOU!!!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spielberg ousts H. G. Wells.,"The War of the Worlds has before been made contemporary. Orson Welles infamous radio broadcast in the 30's for example. Here we have Spielberg bringing it slap bang right into the 21st century. Unfortunately or otherwise it is now more Spielberg than H. G. Wells. What is really a 19th. Century cautionary tale set in Victorian England, becomes with Spielberg's bleak vision of angry aggressive Aliens, a dark contemporary saga about disenchanted children in a broken marriage, the fear of terrorists and 9/11, and that running away from danger is better than fighting it. Sadly very little remains of the original text. Except the opening narration by the excellent Morgan Freeman. Not that Spielberg's effects are not impressive, mostly they are, especially in the early scenes. Despite the Martian Machines looking like rejects from the George Pal version of the 50's, or giant jellyfish, and the ""Martians"" having a strong resemblance to the Gremlins. But the story moves along well enough, and there is a degree of suspense throughout, punctuated continually by Dakota Fanning's screams. Tom Cruise and Tim Robbins do what they can with their roles, overshadowed rather by the SFX. It's not bad entertainment but those seeking the original might do better to check out Jeff Wayne's musical version superbly read by Richard Burton.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Fantastic Update of a Classic,"I have to give Steven Spielberg a lot of credit. If there was ever anybody who could update the H.G. Wells classic ""War of the Worlds"" and do it so well, it could only be Spielberg. Unlike ""Independence Day"", which tries too much to involve us in multiple characters' emotions and what's happening to them, ""War of the Worlds"" gives us one family's point of view, and it actually heightens the tension. It makes this alien invasion seem more personal, more like it's happening to us, as well. Tom Cruise gives a massively underrated performance, perhaps diminished by the off-screen distractions, as the father just trying to keep his kids safe, and Dakota Fanning may give the best performance of a young actor since Haley Joel Osment in ""The Sixth Sense"". All in all, a fantastic thriller. Highly recommended.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The best remake ever and the best movie of 2005,"WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSIf there was a time in which a remake of a movie was as good, if not better than the original, this movie would be one. I remembered watching the original when I was young and when I heard that there was going to be a remake, I knew it would be great. When I saw this, I realized that I was right.The first thing that I like was that about it was that it focuses more on story than effects, which some movies haven't been doing lately until now. Mr. Spielberg does the best if can and it works. The story is about a family trying to survive after alien tripods have awaken from the ground and start destroying everything in their path. After reading some things on the internet, I concluded that its Spielberg's version that seems to be closer related to the book. Like the book (from what I heard and read), the movie focuses on a person trying to get away from all of the chaos that is going on while not knowing the events that surround him. Also, the designs for the tripods in this movie are the same as they were in H.G. Wells' book.The second thing that i enjoyed were the actors. Although Tom Cruise has been a little weird lately in his daily life, he still proves to be a great actor. Tim Robbins and Justin Chatwin also gave great performances. Out of the entire cast, Dakota Fanning was not only the best, but the one who very beyond my expectations. I seen other movies, in which she gave a great performance, but in this movie she blew me away. In this movie, whenever her character is scared, she shows it in a way that other child stars couldn't possibly do. After see her in this movie, Dakota is no doubt going to have a great acting career as she gets older.The third thing that I enjoyed was that Spielberg gives us a true meaning of war and fear. After seeing this movie I was completed frighten by the thought of what would happen if this or something similar to what I just saw came true. Would I be able to survive if it did happen, this question will always be a mystery to me.Although the ending was a little weak, I didn't care because it was similar to the ending of the original movie, which ends with the aliens dying from bacteria that we are immune to. Other than that this movie had many great scenes and moments. One was when we see Gene Barry and Ann Robinson, who we may remembered from the original movie. Another was the part when the characters were driving through town, they were attacked by a mob of people who would do anything to survive. Out of all of them, my favorite scene was when Rachael (played by Dakota Fanning) was singing ""Hushabye Mountain"" during the scene when Ray (played by Tom Cruise) was going to kill Ogivly (played by Tim Robbins) because he wanted to protect her. I loved it the most because it made me both scared of what going to happen, and sad because the way Dakota sang it almost made me wanted to cry.Overall, this was the best movie that I have seen this year. This is also one of Spielberg's best movies yet. I highly recommend this it to fans of the book and the original movie because they mostly like are going to enjoy it.Rating: **** out of ****",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The alien invasion movie that I've always wanted,The first half of War of the Worlds is an A+ but in end half it loses steam when Robbie runs off over the hill because he really wants to see the battle for some reason and Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning's characters run into a basement with this other guy who is played by Tim Robins. Tom Cruise and Tim Robins dont get along to the point Tom Cruise kills Tim Robins but Tom Cruise killing Tim Robins isn't shown for some reason.The fact that this movie is shot from the perspective of the main family is amazing. Not once does the camera cut away to the tripods in another country and thats perfect because it keeps us in eyes of the main family.The aliens in this version are a massive upgrade to the 1953 version. The 1953 aliens are way too cute and the ships look like toys but the aliens in the 2005 version are much more menacing and scary same for the tripods. The tripods also make a really cool fog horn noise which adds to the scale of them. The characters are also a big upgrade as they have something to lose in this one.I give this movie a high 6 out of 10.,6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The first 20 minutes or so into the movie and I am just enveloped in the fast paced action on the screen in front of me. It didn't let go and it was starting to become a great roller-coaster ride where the speed was increasing by the minute, it at times left me gasping for breath and had me giggling with glee at the end of the scene.This is a must see for people who go nuts over special effects and this movie really does deliver and won't stop till the final credits start rolling. The sound in the movie was exceptional it had me ducking for my dear life in some scenes. This is a must own movie if you are a sound maniac like me and own a home theater speaker system and love to crank up the volume while watching movies, this movie will definitely test your speakers and it will have you grinning like a loon because of the top notch sound.The end will leave you feeling as if your roller-coaster ride was short lived and truly, it is.

The War is On!,"Well the signs going into this movie were pretty good. Critics loved the movie plus we got Spielberg and Cruise teaming up so I was expecting a good one. I t was definitely in my top 10 list of movies to see over the summer.Basically this movie does not go very far from the original version released some decades back. Same plot just updated in terms of time and technology.I always grow tired of movies whose main selling point are the effects. I loved the minimalist special effects in this one. This however is still effective in getting the message of fear and dread across.In terms of the acting, I thought that Dakota Fanning did a great job. It's actually quite hard to believe that she is only 11 years old but can do have a masterful performance. I can still remember the first time I saw her in a episode of CSI some years back and she has certainly progressed since then. I thought that Tom Cruise did a good enough of a job as the caring father trying to protect his children Nothing extraordinary but just enough. Nothing much to say about supporting other than that Tim Robbins should have been given longer screen time.I also quite liked the way they were able to put across the theme on family relations and how it is tested in stressful situations.I guess my main gripe and I fell that many will feel this too is that the end came rather abruptly and that how it was all resolved just felt unsatisfactory.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spielberg Takes On a Classic,"""The War of the Worlds"" is based on the classic science-fiction story by H.G. Wells. The newest adaptation is directed by Steven Spielberg, and stars Tom Cruise. Instead of Victorian London, the story is now set in modern-day New York. Cruise plays divorced dad Ray Ferrier, who is taking care of his kids for the weekend. Suddenly, the aliens attack, and panic in the street reigns. This movie boasts some very well done special effects. One eye-catching effect is the victims of the aliens being vaporized. Another is the creepy alien probe that goes into Ogilvy's basement. While the special effects make the movie, the story does not keep up with the visuals. The pairing of Spielberg and Cruise was ambitious, but not enough to make a great movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Over-hyped and Terrible...,"Just got back from a packed advance screening. This movie is so bad, the crowd laughed, that's right laughed at what were supposed to be scary, sad, and certainly NOT funny.The ending is so cheesy and such a cop out, people could audibly be heard saying, 'What the hell?'. Most screenings have applause at the end. This one you could hear crickets.Special effects, yeah they're good. Aliens look kind of cool for the 2 minutes you actually see them. But it's basically two hours of hide and seek and things going boom. Dialouge makes up maybe a total of about 10 minutes, and it's much to dark and ""scary"" for kids.But if you want a good 'popcorn' flick you can do so much better. Batman Begins, Star Wars, even Mr. & Mrs. Smith.

It Is Ain't That Bad,"I really do get the mixed feeling after watching this movie  yet the movie is good, it is not even close to an epic (that it suppose to be), it didn't delivered enough satisfaction, worst of all I feel the movie has really weak story.This is definitely not the script to be working on from the legendary director but Spielberg did managed to direct very well (no bias here), though the angle he shot was very different from other movies (and different is good). Casting is alright, nothing great. (Though I feel other actor might be better choice for Ray).The CGI of aliens and tripods machine was nothing special. What I didn't like about this movie was the high amount of flaw, which can be seen very easily even if you tried to avoid seeing it. Come-on, which dockers has great looking muscle car, leather jacket (that Tom like to wear in real life), Omega watch, and a house with backyard!!! There load more error but don't want to mention it.Overall, Spielberg didn't manage to scare people like he said. The movie is good but I expecting something more (much more) - More fighting (the actual ""war""), more Tripods, more Aliens, more Destruction, more people running and screaming, more of everything.The whole movie seems short with abrupt ending (which people find it to be the most disappointing part of the movie) making it look cheap.Recommendation: It Good, But ID4 Have More Exciting Aliens.Rating: 7/10 (Grade: B-)Please Rate My Review (Yes or No) After Reading It - Thanks",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
War of the Worlds,"War of the Worlds seems, at first, like any other sci-fi action flick. However, despite the many cliches it employs, it quickly turns into something more than what it at first promises. The shift in tone, going from a predictable and somewhat goofy sci-fi extravaganza into a much darker setting, certainly helps in giving this movie its own flair.Indeed, it was that tonal shift that really caught me off guard. This film, like many others like it, sets off by introducing us to a group of characters (in this case, a somewhat broken family) who we get to follow as they endure the trials and tribulations that the story has prepared for them. Typically, that group will face difficult choices and even experience loss. However, there is also an ever-present glow of hope that seems to follow them. It's that sense of hope and familiarity that often keeps the big-budget, sci-fi action blockbusters from feeling fresh and tense. Now, as I said, War of the Worlds starts off exactly like that. The only thing that really set it apart from the plethora of other films in its genre, was the interesting and original alien design. But then again, that's the least you would expect from a film like it. As the film started to pick up some pace and move through the oh so familiar early phases, it started to move into a different direction from what I was expecting. It quickly became evident that these otherwordly invaders had one, and only one goal. To get rid of the human population, for rather sinister purposes.Now, this is where, typically, the brave soldier or some other hero comes forward and is either willing to sacrifice himself for the human race, or at least come up with a solution to overcome the invading forces. What follows, is an epic fight for the survival of the human race, which, predictably, ends in victory. War of the Worlds, however, didn't follow that roadmap. In fact, it took off in the completely opposite direction. Instead of giving glimpses of hope and heroics, it paints a picture of despair and unovercomeable fear. The hero of the story, who is supposed to be unfazed and fearless, can barely keep himself together. The triumphant moment when a path to victory is found never comes. And any sense of hope, however small it might be, is destroyed by an enemy that can't be beaten or even understood. When I began watching this film, I thought I knew exactly what I was getting myself into. However, that belief quickly turned out to be wrong. It is quite astonishing just how difficult this film was at times. Although I was certain, at least in my hopes, that this film, just like others in its genre, would end on a high note, towards the end I started to feel that maybe that might not be the case. So grim is the picture that War of the Worlds paints, that no matter how well I thought I knew the type of film it is, I too, like the characters, started to lose my hope for a happy ending. What's more, usually I'm the first to welcome a film that doesn't follow the usual tropes and is brave enough to propose a story that doesn't end well, but here, I desperately started to wish that there would, indeed, be that warm and familiar conclusion.One of my absolute favourite things about this film was how intense it was at times. In particular, there is one sequence, which takes place in a basement, that kept me on the edge of my seat barely daring to take a breath. It's a sequence that comes without any warning, and it's one that keeps on going for far longer than you'd expect. It even goes as far as to give you a false sense of security only to throw you back into the silence and fear. It's these moments that really made War of the Worlds stand out for me. I'm usually a fan of these types of films, and I tend to enjoy them no matter how stupid and predictable they are. In fact, the reason I tend to like them so much is that they provide the ever satisfying and triumphant ending that always makes me smile. As such, I'm having a hard time placing this film into that genre of film. War of the Worlds, while seemingly an ordinary sci-fi action spectacle, offers so much more. It's much more grim and dark than I could've ever dared to expect. To some extent, it's even scary. The unrelentless tension and the hopeless picture it paints, make it a film quite unlike anything I have ever seen.This is one of those films that I would recommend to someone who is tired of the often mindless and predictable alien invasion, sci-fi action genre. War of the Worlds gives an impression of a thriller, even horror, while still providing the ingredients that make these films so enjoyable and entertaining. While it wasn't the triumphant popcorn flick I was expecting it to be, it was fantastic in its own right. And no matter how grim and hopeless it was, I was unable to look away because of the, at times, unbearable tension.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spielberg's Eye of Science Fiction.,"H.G. Wells' novel, The War of the Worlds was about the invasion of martians from outer space coming to end mankind on Earth. The novel was published in 1898 and it was made into a radio broadcast in 1938 by Orson Welles, considering a prank to fool people into believing that Earth was under attack by the martins. The story later get to the big screen in 1953 and now, turns into a remake of the 1953 film. Steven Spielberg directs this energetic, loud and very exciting version of the classic novel. Tom Cruise plays a family man, who is the father of his daughter and his son. The daughter is played by Dakota Fanning, and she is marvelous playing these characters that scare easily by unfortunate beings, whether it's aliens or ghosts. Later, Cruise's character Ray, flee the town, while everybody is being zapped by the tripods that live underneath the ground. The one I like about the tripods is that they are very menacing and very destructive when it's come to destroying the Earth. The special effects are outstanding in this movie, Cruise's performance is very good and Fanning's performance is also good for her screen performance. War of the Worlds is a good science fiction remake that doesn't pushes itself too far like most other remakes. ★★★ 3 stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Moral of the story: pure sci-fi action,"There's no slowing down for a love story or any deep intellectual meaning. This is an action flick and nothing else. The action started early and didn't stop.

"Great CGI, but weak story and acting","There are scenes in the movie that would surely leave a lasting impression: e.g., a barren landscape filled with gloom and blood, giant tripods destroying whatever in sight. The CGI-induced atmosphere is often fantastic.But characters are either underdeveloped or too conveniently stereotyped in the movie. What's with the son's ridiculously immature attitude? The constant screaming of Fanning Dakota's character is almost cartoonish.Moreover, Fanning Dakota seems to be over-acting. And Tom Cruise in this movie is more reminiscent of his character in Minority Report or Mission Impossible than a redeeming father.The family subplot in the movie is clichéd, which is actually okay given the focus of the movie. But I had expected more story-telling about the aliens' plans and the governments' responses, which of course are conspicuously absent in the movie.

Another Unnecessary Remake of a Classic,"I have just seen ""War of the Worlds"" in the movie theater with my family, and I did not like it. The story is presented through the dysfunctional family of Tom Cruise's character, and that is the greatest problem of this remake: the lead characters are horrible! Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) is an unsecured divorced man, living alone like a pig in a nasty house, without hygiene or having bath before going to bed or washing hands before having meals, putting bread on the table instead of on a dish. Rachel (Dakota Fanning) is hysterical, with disgusting sharp screams, and although being a very young actress, she is histrionic in this film, recalling me a very young version of Glenn Close. I hope the problem is with the character, and not with the actress. Robbie (Justin Chatwin) is a ridiculous teenager, and the way his situation with his father is resolved in the end of the story is too much corny for my taste. Tim Robbins is wasted in the role of a lunatic. The special effects are the good part of this remake. I intend to see the original and naive 1953 ""War of the Worlds"" again with my son, to show him how an excellent movie is made without the necessity of a corny story. This 2005 version is another unnecessary remake of a classic, maybe to satisfy the ego of Tom Cruise.

Forget about the plot holes ...,"... and you might be able to enjoy this. Also if you hate the Cruiser (Tom Cruise that is), you might have a difficult time with the movie, too. Many people criticized his acting at the beginning of the movie, but I thought it was good and it also had Dakota Fanning, to earth it/make it believable.The movie starts slow, but gets in gear fast and stays fast paced throughout ... well not entirely, because when a certain character comes into play late in the movie, it all slows down. You could say it comes to a halt. A full stop so to speak ... and although the following segment is very good, if looked upon as a separate piece, it just feels weird and not right in the movie (for pacing reasons alone).The end won't satisfy many people too ... but it's difficult to find an ending that will satisfy everybody I guess ... btw. I didn't like it as well, but you have to make up your own mind. All in all a nice sci-fi pic then and sometimes even really scary and also real (emotions of the people) ...",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Best and worst of Spielberg,"Spielberg's War of the Worlds is half of a good film.The early stages of the movie show Spielberg at something close to his best, creating the sense (as he did years ago in classics like Jaws and Duel) of the rhythms of everyday life being disrupted by an unknown force. There is a convincingly down-to-earth feel about these early scenes, with Spielberg eschewing his usual weakness for portentous dialogue or glamourized cinematography, if not his weakness for special-effects gore. The first appearance of the alien tripods is genuinely shocking, and the mood of mounting panic in the crowd is palpable.It is clear that Spielberg intends the film to be an allegory for America's experience of terrorism. At first the point seems to be powerfully made. Tom Cruise comes across initially as an inspired piece of casting, playing a character who is cocksure and immature and complacent, yet resourceful and basically decent -- the image of America itself. There are some striking images, some of which explicitly evoke 9/11. But as the film wears on, these images seem to be opportunistically repeated rather than being thematically developed in any way. The first sign of trouble is the gratuitous appearance of a crashed airliner in the front yard of a house. The wreckage conveniently misses the parked car in the driveway which will be the family's means of escape. Comically, the car then manages to wind speedily through stalled traffic most of the way from New York to Boston with barely a toot of the horn. In a piece of perhaps unconscious irony, the car comes to seem as important a symbol as any in the film -- a symbol, in this case, of the accustomed American way of life.The film goes nowhere in its second half. Most of it is set in a basement where suspense is built up as routinely and pointlessly as in any teen horror film. There is no plot development to speak of. Spielberg makes little attempt to find a cinematic way of explaining the aliens' eventual downfall, lamely relegating the explanation to a voice-over at the end.There is another allegory here waiting to be explored. It is the story of an invading power that uses its overwhelming technological advantage ruthlessly to crush everything in its path, and still fails in the end because of inadequate preparation and the inability to adapt to local conditions. Apart from one throwaway line uttered by a minor character (""occupations always fail, right?""), the film does not come within a lunging tentacle of such discomfiting thoughts.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Would've been great on Mystery Science Theater!,"Too bad MST 3K is no longer around. I'd love to see Tom Servo, Crow and Mike Nelson tear this turkey apart. One can only hope that Spielberg's WOTW will inspire them to come out of retirement. It's somewhat discomforting that one of our generations finest filmmakers has produced something deserving the same treatment as the Gamera series, Lost Continent and the Crawling Eye (OK, I rather liked that one when I was a kid), but that's what happens when you combine a completely illogical premise with irritating characters and a story so full of holes and absurd occurrences that one wonders if the crew ever watched the final product before releasing it.Let's see if I've got this right. You're an alien civilization with technology that allows not only interplanetary travel (at least this since in this edition of the story the aliens are not explicitly said to be from Mars) but transport of heavy equipment over such distances on a scale required to overcome the defenses of a populated world. You either 1) undertake this gigantic enterprise without first ascertaining what would be required to overcome the natives or 2) for some unfathomable reason, decide to transport an army of immense military machines complete with radiation beams that are presumably capable of destroying anything known to your civilization and defensive shields that can presumably withstand any weapon known to your civilization to a world whose most advanced species is a bunch of hominid wannabes that are just discovering the joy of bipedalism. Why not just take over then?I don't buy the argument that they couldn't do the ""being"" transport until the 21st century (on Earth). Why would they even consider sending the machines until they were sure they could send the operators? If such a long period elapsed between the delivery of the machines and the onset of the invasion would there still be knowledge that the machines were sent and where they were located (I mean what planet, let alone what coordinates on the planet!)? The machines must have been delivered before any recorded history on Earth otherwise their arrival would've been, you know, NOTICED!!!. And if the machines were left where they were originally buried, the incessant probing, imaging and digging of the Earth by modern industrial civilization would've uncovered at least one of the gadgets located say, RIGHT ACROSS THE BLEEPING HUDSON RIVER FROM NYC!!!. Even a crew of incompetent malcontents from the local cable monopoly might've accidentally stumbled on one.I wouldn't condemn a movie merely for having plot holes (Casablanca, one of my all-time favorites, has some real howlers). The problems with War of the Worlds 2005 are not just plot holes they are major, debilitating flaws in the premise of the story that lower the plausibility below the level to which one's disbelief can reasonably be suspended. I'm not familiar with the novel but the original film avoids these problems by having the machines arrive at the time the invasion is to begin. The original film is also immeasurably better for being told from the point of view of a scientist who is in contact with the higher echelons of the government and military that are providing the defensive reaction. This gives the big picture view that gets short shrift in the 2005 edition.Spielberg's choice to tell the story from the point of view of a random citizen caught up in the maelstrom has possibilities, but suffers from the injection of the superfluous subplot involving Ray's (Cruise's character) parenting issues. It's not that parenting issues are unimportant or make an uninteresting film subject it's that they might be a bit less imperative than say, oh, I don't know ... AN ALIEN INVASION OF THE EARTH!!!! Not only that but Ray and his bratty kids are all completely insufferable as characters and give us little reason to be interested in their plight above any other person's. Making them the focus of this movie detracts from the central theme. To go back to my Casablanca example, the characters are so compelling that one can look past the obvious flaws in the story. Here, the insufferable characters accentuate the bad story.There are some great moments in this film: the burning train, Tim Robbins' scenes, the overturning of the ferry, the mob scene. However, in this case, the whole is much less than the sum of the parts. The original film is somewhat hokey early fifties sci-fi fare. But, it's a lot better than Spielberg's edition, which comes off more as a vehicle to sell lunch boxes and action figures than it does as an example of good film-making. I'm not sure why Spielberg felt another edition of War of the Worlds was necessary but whatever point he was trying to make was lost on me.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Amazing movie. A MUST See.,"This was my favorite movie I have seen in a long time. Great acting by the characters, amazing effects and action, and it really glues you into the story. It'll keep you keep wondering how(if) they will survive this extermination. Awesome, Awesome Movie. Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning were excellent actors, and Dakota should have a great future. This movie was amazing and I highly recommend it, great thriller-action packed movie. Horror also for a lot of people. The ending was a bit sudden. I saw this movie twice already and soon will be off to see it again with family this time. Better get a large bucket of popcorn and never stop to leave the theater for a second because you wont want to miss a thing. Be sure to pick great close seats for the thrill. The alien ""tripods"" look very great, and are very well done, but I'm going to keep away from spoilers. This movie makes you feel right in the action and at the start it starts to feel real, as if you were watching some documentary. Just one thing. DO NOT LISTEN TO THE JERKS WHO SPAM UP THE REVIEWS SAYING ITS a disappointment when it is NOT. Sure you may not give it a 10/10 but I bet you will give it a rating around that point.

War of the Worlds,"Oh dear, what a disappointment. Somebody needs to be spanked. Just when you thought you were going to see a great movie, you get this mess instead. Too bad they didn't read the H.G. Wells story before they made this stupid movie. It needed more suspense and less of the personal problems of an unlikeable slob. And, no, Tom Cruise singing, ""My Little Deuce Coup,"" to his daughter when she asks for a lullaby, doesn't qualify as cute, comic relief. Poor Tom. He looked like he was acting in ""Mission Impossible vs. The Aliens From Another Planet."" Hmmmm, did I mention that they changed the story? There was no climatic ending. Whatever happened to the old axiom, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it""? H.G Well's story was oh so much better than this. The only good thing it did was to make me want to go home and watch the old 1950's version of the movie again. It was ever so much better than this new version.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Tom Cruise saves the world...again!!!,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The PitsRay Ferrier (Tom Cruise) is a disgruntled dock worker who's got custody of his kids for a while and is planning to spend his time with them wisely. He goes out his house a minute and notices an unusually fearsome looking weather-cloud. At first unfazed, some freak weather conditions later and it is just the beginning of the nightmare that is to come involving cracks in the ground, mass hysteria and giant android machines that will destruct everything in their path. The planets have been at peace for too long- soon the 'war of the worlds' will begin...It's summer. Time for the 'blockbuster' period to begin. And what would it all be without 'blockbuster' favourite Tom Cruise and directing favourite Steven Spielberg and their contribution to the genre, in this case an adaptation of the classic HG Wells novel?Like many re-makes before it, I've not seen the original (well before my time, I'm afraid!) and so I suppose that's a blessing in a way as I'm able to review this version more objectively without comparing it to it's predecessor too much. In terms of quality, it for all intents and purposes does little more than serve it's function as a 'summer blockbuster', with some excellent special effects and certainly not in the way of anything else, in the shape of some dreary human drama and a perfunctory script. It's been in the papers how a famous cabinet minister (or something?) has promised to have the British film censors heads on a platter after the film received a 12A certificate on account of the shocking? violence the film contains. There are some edgy scenes where people get vaporized to bits in front of the camera, but they are not overly shocking and the full extent of the brutality is not shown. In terms of things to think about, the film pushes the 'we're arrogant to think we're alone in the universe' message and it hits a true note...On the performances front, Cruise is serviceable in the lead role but there were moments in this film that caused me to have flashbacks to his days as a teen heart-throb and left me wondering if he'd really matured enough in all that time to take on roles like this. But the absolute star of the show without a shadow of a doubt is Dakota Fanning as his daughter. You'll either find her perfectly precocious (as I did!) or find her heart-warmingly cute, but either way her role works and she is the film's second biggest saving grace. This is a girl who'll be remembered as a brilliant child star and should go on to even greater things in later years. In a co-starring role (some may even call it a cameo!) Tim Robbins has a slightly un-nerving turn as a man who lives on a farm. Spielberg manages some tense scenes but mostly just provides standard direction for this kind of thingOverall, War of the Worlds is a 'summer blockbuster' starring Tom Cruise and directed by Steven Spielberg and little more. It's that time of the year again, and you should just expect films like this to come by. Ten years ago, I might have found this film more than enough to suffice, but now I'm older and a bit more, er, 'critical' of what I see, that's all it is to me. ***",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Should be War of the Stupid Children,"Tom Cruise singing a lullaby. Get real. This story can be told so many interesting ways and from so many angles. I do not understand why essentially Spielberg told a story about a rotten father dealing with really stupid children trying to get to of all places Boston, after leaving a destroyed New York. Who would in their right minds- when the earth is being overrun by people eating monsters attacking every major city go from New York to Boston????? There are so many ""why would anyone do that?""'s in this movie it starts to very difficult to believe anything anyone does. The movie really didn't work for me on any level. Poor character development. Tom Cruise was miscast And while the special effects were stunning, they really didn't seem to serve any purpose and principally consisted of lots of people running crazy this way and that. Batman was a great movie. This one is not one of Spielberg's best or even average.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A coherent point of view,"Well, I am not a first class Spielberg or Cruise fan, but I must admit their work is just fine here. Cruise brilliantly acts a man which is not a (super) hero and that won't actually same the whole world (better say our world, given the title) on his own. The character is a common man, running for his life and for his children's. The thing I like the movie for most is that Spielberg sticks to Cruise's character's point of view. So, we won't see the aliens too in detail, we won't attend a board meeting of their army chiefs (nor a human one, for instance) and so you won't be given many details on how they actually are defeated or why they act this way: we only know what the main character witnesses or deduces. Disappointing in some way, but coherent I'd say. Great special effects, good direction, good acting, here are the good points. Bad points are part of the ending (can't say which of course), and sometimes the behavior of the girl (obviously too ""written"").",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
a master filmmaker loves humanity but won't trust us,"Steven Spielberg is a master movie maker, and in his hands this vicious assault of a film is poised, artful, and eminently accessible. His mastery of the form surpasses the best work of other directors of summer blockbusters, with seemingly little effort.Spielberg understands, as few do, what reality actually looks like. He shows us our cities and towns as we see them, yet also understands the audience's guilty catharsis in watching our own destruction. This power of observation grounds the special effects and spreads a stomach churning haze of believability like a pall over this film.Computer generated special effects are still an immature technology, however, and even in the hands of this gifted filmmaker they occasionally overpower the visual imagery. The falling objects invariably explode too closely to the main character, distracting us from the otherwise believable imagery.Spielberg has always made expansive films that reach out to everyone equally. His vision of film as mass entertainment always pushes the line between art and commerce. Unlike the stylish but mean spirited movies that other directors attack us with, he cares about humanity, and his films ultimately attempt to connect us to each other and the perilous beauty of our condition on this planet.The only flaw of this movie, as with so many of Spielberg's other offerings, is a tragic inability to trust the intellect of his audience. Spielberg understands movies, and Spielberg understands art. But Spielberg will always be afraid to make a film that is truly art, that has the emotional and narrative complexity to appeal to that inner sense we all have of how art transforms our perceptions of ourselves and the human condition. Spielberg is a master of the visual realm, and understands how imagery affects emotion like few do. He cannot, however, release control of the puppet strings and allow us to think for ourselves. This film, like his others to date, are tantalizing cultural showpieces that fail as works of art.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Another 2005 disappointment,"I couldn't wait for this one. As a kid War of the Worlds was my favorite film. That is until Nov. 1977 when Close Encounters came out, and has since been my #1 film. I hate long reviews so... Not as dumb as ID4, though could have used some of the thrilling moments from that flick. Not as bad as any Shamalan films, those look good on paper but always LAME! Signs, anyone? yuck!If you are expecting Jaws meets Close Encounters like me. sorry! This is too much Tom Cruise and not enough fun. It starts off great.

Coulda Been Worse... Coulda Been Better...,"WAR OF THE WORLDS (3 outta 5 stars) Not one of the best Spielberg movies (not even the best Spielberg/Tom Cruise collaboration) but the movie has a lot of good stuff in it and is a lot better than the average ""summer action"" movie. The movie starts out pretty well... with some very believable and well-directed bits of suspense (the lightning, the wind, the cracks slowly opening up the ground). The alien tripods (and their accompanying sound effects) are a pretty scary sight for the most part. I found the death rays a little silly (uh, why are the martians blasting humans to atoms anyway when it is discovered later that they are harvesting their blood?) but the depiction of the panic and the widespread devastation get top marks. The problems with this movie are mostly apparent after the scene on the ferry. It seems that after that scene the filmmakers can't decide what to do next.. so Spielberg retreads old suspense ""gimmicks"" from previous movies. There is a ridiculous scene with three humans hiding out in a wide-open, bombed-out basement and remain UNSEEN (!!!) while a bunch of aliens walk around them (for no real reason, really... uh, sightseeing?). Firstly, it is very reminiscent of the kitchen scene in ""Jurassic Park""... and seems like a too-desperate attempt at hooking the audience. Secondly, why do they have to show us the aliens anyway? (Dull, unimaginative aliens at that!) I think it would have been much more effective to not show them at all until the final scenes. Did Spielberg forget about a great, little movie called ""Duel"" where the identity of the driver of the killer truck was NEVER revealed? Did he forget how effective that was? How it added to the suspense? Spielberg's worst movie crime comes in the last 5 minutes of the movie... I won't say too much about it... just that it's totally uncalled for and it brings to mind Hooper's ""miraculous"" escape at the end of ""Jaws"". It seems like Spielberg is staying firm with all his bad habits and slowly shedding all his GOOD ones. Not much to say about the acting. It's standard disaster movie emoting... Tom Cruise plays a ""bad"" father (but in a kinda cute, lovable way, Dakota Fanning gets to scream and be annoying and Tim Robbins gets to play a possibly psychotic survivalist (more of that Final Act desperation I spoke of earlier). The movie's not all bad... it could have been a lot worse in less capable hands... unfortunately it also could have been a lot BETTER!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Nothing is impossible when love motivates you,"Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) does not seem the best folks. Has two sons, a teenager named Robbie with whom he has already a certain degree of confrontation, and a small, vivacious blonde named Rachel (a wise Dakota Fanning), which fills nearly every corner of your heart. But Ray is separated and only sees his children on weekends, time in which he makes every effort to brighten the time, though not always succeed.During the last visit of the boys to his apartment, an unusual and surprising fact external, will mark their lives and give them the opportunity to experience many things. Suddenly, a whole extraterrestrial spacecraft command sprout from the earth and massive attack takes place, sowing panic as in their action disintegrate or kidnapped dozens of people.Steven Spielberg, always accessing the latest in special effects, achieves a surprising realism to create a chaotic situation like that which cause an earthquake. Sets that account for the horrendous destruction, powerful mass management, lighting and contrasting Gothic effective camera movement... and the always effective John Williams scores of unique, creates an environment that impacts deeply and, shortly, introduces us stage to share the drama of the Ferrier family.Thematically, we see the exercise of a father who, although somewhat comfortable with the daily routine of existence, suddenly, being under pressure, removes a huge resilience and an appreciation for their children that we never before recognized. Life, in its exemplary wisdom, is responsible for showing the performance of others and this insurance as lectures and reveals the way of consistency. For those who have children like Ray - I also have a boy and a girl - very easy We connect it with their adventures and that unconditional surrender to protect. Personally, I felt that the film goes beyond the visual - effective up to where you want - and beyond with premium content where solidarity and resistance before the attack.In fact, the military look so distant and ineffective as in the real and gruesome episode 11-09-01.And for this very reason that, if a bit abrupt, way to conclude the story is unusual but not incredible Therefore, if you still believe that the security of your country is in charge of government and security forces still lack a bit for you know who is really in charge.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spielberg's Worst,The characters in this movie had me cheering for the martians after only half an hour. Tom Cruise spent most of the movie chasing his kids to get them back.

A great popcorn movie!,"Here we have another alien invasion story. Unlike the original 'War of the Worlds' (1953) or 'Independence Day' (1996), this film focuses on a family coming to terms with the fact that the world is being invaded from creatures beyond the stars. Yep, it's an emotional one, but never fear there are some pretty good action sequences too.Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) is a dead-beat dad. He has no clue when it comes to his kids and has little interest in them. When the kids (played by Justin Chatwin and Dakota Fanning) come to stay for the weekend whilst Mum (Miranda Otto) and Step dad head to Boston, all hell breaks loose when a freak lightning storm sees the coming of aliens that are hell bent on destroying humanity. The story follows the trials and tribulations of the Ferrier family as they go on the run and try to survive this invasion.The Special Effects peeps working on this film really pulled out all the stops. Explosions galore, car chases, riots, and random acts of violence - this is an action film with the trademark Spielberg sentimentality attached. ET has arrived and he's not being very friendly. The Tripod War Machines are amazingly designed and very intimidating. The only disappointment is that the Heat Ray isn't actually a heat ray, but more of a disintegrater.With regards to the story, the plot sticks loosely to the book. We've still got the elements of the original story in there - tripods, heat ray, harvesting humans for food, the red weed, etc. There's no mention of the Thunder Child (the ship in the book that managed to disable one of the tripods after a tremendous battle), and the character of Oglivy (played brilliantly by Tim Robbins) is a combination of several key characters from the book - the Parson who is driven to madness, the Artilleryman who wants to create a brave new world underground and, of course, Oglivy the scientist. The aliens in the movie are never mentioned as Martians. In fact, the word 'alien' is never even mentioned, or at least I don't remember it being mentioned. They are always referred to as 'Them'.There's lots of suspense. I literally chewed my nails down to the cuticles during some of the later scenes. There's nothing in here to make you jump, but it'll have you hanging on the edge of your seat, wondering if the terror that the characters are going through will ever end.The emotional aspect of the movie heightens the suspense. We have a man who barely knows his kids, trying to bond with them during an extremely difficult time and he knows for a fact that they'd rather be off on their own than with him. This man is trying to keep it together for his kids, but can't and that is what eventually leads to a break-through between them.The most harrowing scene is probably the scene at the ferry terminal. We have hundreds of desperate and scared people who are willing to do anything to escape, even if it means forcibly removing a man and his children from their car at gunpoint. It just goes to show that an individual person is smart and calm, but people are stupid and dangerous.The major downside to the movie is the abruptness of the ending. It's over so quickly considering how drawn out everything else is. That's all I'm saying about it. I don't want to ruin it for you.'War of the Worlds' is a great popcorn movie. As always, Tom Cruise delivers a good performance, but it would be nothing without the support of the wonderful Dakota Fanning.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Spielberg blends his peccadilloes, blockbuster style.","Divorced dad Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) has his two kids, Rachel (Dakota Fanning) & Robbie (Justin Chatwin), staying with him for the weekend. Already feeling inconvenienced due to his parental inadequacies, things are further complicated by the arrival of aliens, who after a lighting storm awakes them from the earth, start to lay waste to America.Having failed to ignite the box office in his customary way with his last two directorial outings (The Terminal & Catch Me If You Can ), Steven Spielberg, arguably played safe with his next film. Re-teaming with mega star Tom Cruise, Spielberg decided to put his take on the much lauded source material written by H.G. Wells, The War Of The Worlds. Armed with a budget of $132 million and with Josh Friedman & David Koepp adapting, Spielberg promptly made a movie that Worldwide grossed $591,745,540.As is nearly always the way with Spielberg's movies tho, the film has proved to be most divisive. Likewise, as with nearly every alien invasion movie ever made, War Of The Worlds couldn't hope to appease a majority of genre compliant observers. Too cheap (Earth Vs The Flying Saucers), too brainless (Independence Day) and too talky (Signs), just some of the complaints to have come the way of other genre attempts. Spielberg, obviously aware of such things since he loves this little offshoot of the sci-fi market, tries to cover all bases. The result being what ultimately is a well crafted, intelligent and thrilling movie that is a collection of his favourite movie material. You can tick off the Spielberg conventions as you go. For the first hour as Cruise and kids try to evade the marauding tripods, the film is exhilarating, with no expense spared and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski shooting it with a moody tint so befitting the material. While the effects work is top dollar and worth the admission fee alone. Where the film suffers in the view of many is for its final third, where it slows to an almost standstill as Spielberg and co try to make sense of it all, the post 9/11 feel cranking its head to peer out from the gloom. To be fair, Wells' own novel ending is hardly brilliant as it is, but Koepp and the bearded one test the patience big time here with a very unsatisfactory conclusion. You can see why lots of multiplex visitors felt a little cheated having invested a couple of hours of their time. The young actors are merely OK, borderline annoying at times, they do enough to make the fragmented family on the run dynamic work, while Cruise drops in one of his ""professional"" performances. Other than those we get a bizarre little turn from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman naturally does the narration.Not prime stuff from one of our finest cinematic entertainers, but much to admire and enjoy: even if it continues a run of weak endings that threatens to dethrone him as the blockbuster king. 7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

This is a disgrace to the whole history of cinematography. Please don't watch it, just watch the Three Stooges instead. The plot was horrible, Tom Cruise was awful, his son's character incredibly dull, Dakota fanning OK, but the rest of the movies was just painful to watch, I even started eating sunflower seeds to get rid of the pain as I was watching it. the special effects were so so, the plot so simple it was like a third grader's homework patched up by a forth grader. the whole movie just did not make sense. the final lines of the movie that summed the whole theme of the movie, if Spielberg had just put them on the screen for two hours it would make a better movie than what I saw. I usually don't criticize movies this way, but this was enough. After watching Close Encounters of the Third Kind and this movie back to back I just started to wonder that Spielberg's talent is downhill. He just should have stopped with Schindler, because everything since, with minor disruptions with Minority Report is just flashy thrash. The soundtrack was a disaster. Cinematography had its moments but overall was poor. Even Scientology can not help Tom Cruise with his awful performance (I still think his appearance in Magnolia was his best role). Somebody needs to tell Cruise's son's character in that movie to think about changing professions, get a singing job or something, cause the kid can't act, not that I can, but nobody pays 8 bucks to watch me on the screen.

Great movie,"Warning: In this review I will be giving bits of the movie in description. Number one, 1st and foremost, this movie is nothing like the first one, thank God. I did not want a direct remake of the first one. I like the way they change it up and make it about a different family. For those that act like what happens in the movies has happened to them in real life, please go back to watching soap operas and leave the REAL movie reviews to actual movie fans. This movie is freaking awesome, and if you can't see that, then I have an extra pair of glasses for you to borrow. There is a reason why Tom Cruise acts the way he does in the movie. He is trying to get his kids to love him and show them that he cares. In the house where Tim Robbins character is making a pass at his daughter, his fatherly instincts kick in and he has to do what has to be done. Tom Cruise's character has been emotionally numb for several years and it takes a while for him to come around. All in all this is a great movie with superb acting and awesome special effects.

This is a Really Bad Movie,"Sometimes I wish IMDb reviews were allowed to be short and to the point, because the summary says it all...This is a Really Bad Movie.I don't really expect a masterpiece from Tom Cruise or even Steven Spielberg anymore, but they can usually be counted on for two hours of entertainment. Not the case here.Tom Cruise was miscast to play this role. He was not believable in the least. It didn't help that this version of the classic tale had such a goofy feel and sub plots attached to it. However, I dare say that if Cruise was not such a big name he would be up for a Golden Raspberry Award for his simply awful performance.As for Spielberg, I think he has lost all touch with reality and everyday people. He just seems to no longer have any clue how to portray ordinary people on film. Great films draw you in and make you believe them, they make you think about them for days. This film was completely superficial and lacked any believability or credibility. I think Spielberg feels all that is necessary for character development is a scene or two showing that the character is estranged from their spouse or kids.Don't look for anything worthwhile here.

I am sure he hired hundreds of people to do the actual job instead of him physically present; I guess he ONLY monitored the rushes. So that's a good remake, very impressive in terms of special effects and production design, but I am not a science fiction film specialist either.... I loved the cameo appearances with Gene Barry and his female co star with whom he played in Byron Haskin's genuine, original film, back in 1953. Gene Barry's last film.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spielberg at his best,"Nobody can be trusted more than Spielberg to make a good blockbuster. This is classic Spielberg with all his usual touches. Above all else Spielberg understands the rule that things that cannot be seen are far more scary than things that can.The film doesn't take long to introduce the characters before putting them through all sorts of nasty problems. Will they survive the ordeal? The odds seemed stacked against them, but since it's Tom Cruise who knows. The action is more or less unrelenting with the end being a little rushed. Overall pretty good stuff though with plenty of scary moments. I'm sure the theme park ride will be under development as I write this.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great summer blockbuster like ID4,"War of the Worlds has been a very popular franchise since its release as a book in 1898, since it became one of the pioneers of what is now known as Science Fiction. It also served as an inspiration for countless films, such as Star Wars and Independence Day. All ""War of the Worlds"" movies, radio shows, ans so forth have been widely popular and successful, and this movie is no exception.Set in modern-day New York, Tom Cruise plays Ray, a divorced, working-class father who is rarely there with his children, Rachel and Robbie. but when a series of surrealistic disasters and earthquakes have begun to take shape, the trio is forced to move away from the suburb as quiclky as possible as massive tripods begin to surface from underneath the pavement cracks.Sharp and fast-paced adaptation of the H.G Well's novel gives a franchise a more modern face-lift. Director Steven Spielberg gives some terrific scenes which will keep people on the edge of their seat (I don't remember anyone walking out on the movie, not even for the bathroom), which give the movie a psychologically scary feel, without being explicit. The film's special effects are amazing, and they not obstruct the film's story line, in contrast with the many effects-laden summer blockbusters of today. All of the actors make rather great performances-- for a sci-fi film--, and that includes Tom Cruise, who is always been viewed more on his good looks and financial shrewdness than for his acting skills. Dakota Fanning shines in her role as his daughter, and plays an essential part in the film's storyline. Tim Robbins make a good, although brief, appearance in the film as a former doctor gone mad. John William's music is as good as ever, and gives the movie the atmosphere it tries to characterise, and Spielberg's direction make this movie a more realistic ""what if"" disaster scenario than ID4.But there are still a number of flaws: like ID4, it is burdened by having relatively dumb human stories, flat and one-dimensional supporting characters, as well as for being over-focused on Ray and his family. The movie ends rather abruptly for a big-budget picture (117 mins. long), and purists will complain about its differences with the book (it doesn't tell where these aliens come from), and it slows down around halfway, where the trio must face a cat-and-mouse game with the aliens, and a ship's searchlight a la 1953 version.Nevertheless, War of the Worlds is a fun movie, and you'll never be bored for not even a single minute of it. It's run-time is rather short than what most people expected, but it is worth 1 hour and 57 minutes of your time.*** out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Suspend Disbelief, Ignore Continuity , Good Characters","The difference between good fiction and mere entertainment is the development of the characters; they can not remain static, the development must flow from the story, and, in a movie (I can't bring myself to call them 'films') the actor must be able to believably reveal and express the changes in the character.Unlike in many action and science fiction movies, in which the special and visual effects reign supreme, all of the primary characters is this movie changed, and their transformation is what makes the movie good. Ray (Cruise) goes from child to man; Robbie (Chatwin) goes from rebel to warrior; and Rachel (Fanning) goes from one of those unrealistic overly competent kids the movies are always serving up, and which, in the case of Rachel, comes from being sheltered in a private school and affluent home to being, near the end, in an almost catatonic state of shock.In contrast to all the reviewers who found her character annoying, I found it very refreshing. Rachel goes from an independent, miniature adult ordering health food delivery to being...gasp...a terrified, panicked and needy child. In the beginning, one could easily imagine Rachel raising her own father, but by the end the characters have both done a one-eighty, and there is not doubt who the adult is.I wouldn't have believed it unless I saw it, but Cruise was actually able to adeptly convey his character's transformation and to express genuine emotion, besides anger. On the boat, Cruise was able to show how his view of his son had changed from disapproval to profound pride without uttering a word. With the exception of ""Born on the Fourth of July,"" Cruise is the definition of static character, until now.There are a lot of continuity mistakes, but they rarely break the flow, and, besides, subtle continuity breaks often provide entertainment in otherwise dull movies. In addition, one does have to willfully suspend some disbelief, but it's easy to do because it's necessary for the story and character development.For example, in the bridge screen between flight and victory in the house with Ogilvy (Robbins) why did the aliens feel the need to spend so much time searching *that* house that they sent a probe, then three aliens, then, much later because Rachel sleeps and awakens, another probe? They're out in a fairly rural area with a whole world to conquer. They don't have infrared technology, either, apparently! Yet, this was necessary to slow things down, develop the horror of just what the aliens' intentions were and to develop character, even if much of it was unlikely.Likewise, the final resolution of the differences between Ray and Ogilvy was necessary to develop Ray and his newfound capacity for parental duty, even though the resolution (not to mention having Rachel sing) would have both been sources of greater noise, noise which Ray was desperate to stop, than Ogilvy's mind-snapped chant.This scene not only developed Ray, it proved Ogivy's maxim. He tells Ray that as an ambulance driver he has learned that those who make it, those who don't flat-line on the way to the hospital, are the ones ""who keep their eyes open."" Ray learns from this, but Ogivy becomes the proverbial ostrich, literally burrowing into the ground, figuratively shutting his eyes in terror.I don't mind suspending disbelief with the cars on the freeway, all of which broke down on one side or the other, but never in the same place so as to block the highway, because Ray needed to flee. However, I do mind suspending disbelief when it has no value to the story or characters. Having the aliens bury their ""tripods"" here millions of years ago--a break with the original--is such an example.If they were here millions of years ago why not just take over the planet then? Some may argue, based on what they were doing, that they needed a harvest, but there were plenty of animals around then, they could have raised humans, like in ""The Matrix,"" they were vaporizing millions of humans anyway, and, besides, it's just too convenient that they managed to bury them under our major cities worldwide millions of years ago. It serves no purpose but to irritate.Likewise, the birds landing on the ""tripod"" and demonstrating the force field is down so the army could at least get one small victory is annoying. The aliens were sick, not stupid.This movie does not, as many reviewers in other countries have claimed, engage in American jingoism. America is as much a victim as other countries, and we don't save the world. In fact, if Ogivy is correct, the Japanese seem to have been the only nation successful using human technology. Further, the only real political point is made by Ogivy, and I have little doubt Robbins himself insisted on it, when he said that history has taught us that ""all occupations fail."" This is, no doubt, intended to bring Iraq to the forefront of the viewers' minds.I was very pleasantly surprised by the movie. I didn't see it at the theater because I expected a mindless action flick with static characters, and I'm not a Cruise fan anyway, but it's not. The characters drive the movie, and the action drives the characters. It's Cruise's best movie, and Spielberg's best science fiction movie since ""Jurassic Park.""",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I was very worried about the performance of Tom Cruise,"I was very worried about the performance of Tom Cruise and at first thought Tom Hanks would be a better choice. Also because a pretty face can destroy a particular character.But I must admit that Tom Cruise is a great actor though I still would prefer a more ""observer"" kinda actor like Sam Neill or John Hurt in sucha role. Sam Neill the best actor you can find around in my opinion. One of the only actors who can make you forget his face cause he really is the character and not a kind of ""copy of"".But CHAPO; Tom Cruise.Spielberg did the greatest job by following the original The War of the Worlds novel which, don't forget was already written in 1898! What I mist was the third person observing from the outside. The voice in the beginning is a little mistake from Spielberg. That should be the voice of Tom Cruise which would ad up to the character as more ""observing"" and less ""undergoing"" like it did in the movie.What is so amazing about the book is that it still is able to touch the hart which again proves the genius of H.G. Wells. They didn't have laser-technology in 1898, think about that!People who played the game Half_Life surely recognize these tripods. Actually they where greatly inspired by H.G.Wells War of the World machines. Myself couldn't think of anything else when playing this part of the game, really huge.The special effects in this movie are really really great and that always has been Spielberg's major quality. He must have a great eye for those talents in the business no doubt about it.Still wondering about why the have chosen a different film size not 2:1 folks? I liked this unusual, kinda old need fashioned film size. Did you notice how the higher ISO from the used celluloid added up to the special effect scenes?And remember; ""Orson Welles' Mercury Theater radio broadcast, based on The War of the Worlds, caused a panic in the Eastern United States on October 30, 1938. In Newark, New Jersey, all the occupants of a block of flats left their homes with wet towels round their heads and in Harlem a congregation fell to its knees. Welles, who first considered the show silly, was shaken by the panic he had unleashed and promised that he would never do anything like it again. Later Welles attempted to claim authorship for the script, but it was written by Howard Koch, whose inside story of the whole episode, The panic broadcast; portrait of an event,appeared in 1970.""",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good show, but not nearly as 'earth-shaking' as you might expect...","... It reminded me of ""Titanic"" in a lot of ways; you can see where all the money's gone; and a number of the visuals are quite simply fantastic. We know Spielberg can handle a set-piece; but for me, since the early days of films like Jaws he's comparatively lacking in the ability to marry such talent with the due care and attention required for a script. Give him a 'little' film, and he'll explore wider issues; let him loose on a blockbuster these days, and he goes for the showier moments to the detriment of other pleasures. Those of you who've seen ""The Lost World"" might get what I'm trying to say.""Titanic"" was a big film where the script took a backseat, and so is the case here. Of course, that doesn't mean there isn't some enjoyment to be had from what's on offer - and those just looking to marvel at the spectacle won't give a hoot; but why assemble a cast with such big-hitters, when there's not much thought behind their actions beyond 'look panicked'? At times it feels like a loosely disguised retrospective of Spielberg's past numbers, too; riffing on all the things you'd expect, like ""Close Encounters"" and ""Jurassic Park"". Why 'revisit' though, when such ground has already been covered? I hate to whine too much when something looks as good as this does; but it sorta feels like a step backward for Steven, after the looser, more 'experimental' style he's shown us with his recent work...",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Despite neat special effects and terror, it's not the best alien flick","The first time that Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise teamed up to make a movie together with Minority Report (2002), it really put them on the map where from dazzling special effects to a good story line proving that you can have a top actor and a top director making one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life.Spielberg and Cruise second time is really more flat like a soda than the first.""War of the Worlds"", based on the famous Orson Welles radio broadcast that left the world in a frenzy is on the big screen. It's Steven Spielberg's third time around making ""alien"" pictures after his first attempt in the 1970's flick Close Encounters of the Third Kind (the best in my opinion) where it showed how something out of the ordinary can be something amazing to everybody. In 1982, Steven brought the ""awe"" back in movie experience by making E.T. (The Extra Terrestrial) where it showed that an unlikely bond between an alien and an outcast child. Now Steven is back but bringing more menace to his aliens than the cute creatures.Tom Cruise is Ray Ferrier, a divorce father who sees his children whenever the wife (Miranda Otto) needs something. His children are played by Justin Chatwin and the talented Dakota Fanning in which they don't seem to fond of their father once they arrive to spend the weekend with them. It's all moaning and argument until something happens in the skies leaving all of the citizens in New Jersey to wonder what's happening before an alien invasion takes place. People are being hit with laser beams and buildings being destroyed while Tom Cruise and his kids try to get away from everything as possible.It becomes too annoying when Spielberg makes too many references about 9/11 from a frame photograph of Tom Cruise's character and the family of the twin towers in the background along with the American flags we see at each house to the references of the attacks from the rubble, the destroyed planes and so forth. Dakota Fanning is a wonderful actress but her screaming had to make me want to get ear plugs after one too many screams made me want to hit myself with a pillow.But despite what I wrote in my last paragraph, I'm still recommending this movie as a thriller where the special effects along with the tension music from John Williams (a Spielberg regular) doesn't make this film so bad to watch.Not the best alien flick I've ever seen, but it's entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
My expectations were low but apparently not low enough.,"I had some reason to hope this might be a pleasant surprise since Minority Report was quite good. I guess it's difficult to ruin good source material and Philip K. Dick wrote some of the best. I thought I would not enjoy the movie because I wouldn't be able to get past all of Cruise's recent moronic rantings, instead I was stunned by how truly awful the movie was.The FX, of course, were exceptional and I doubt they would play as well on the TV screen but I dearly wish I had at least saved a few dollars by going to a matinée. The script, sadly, was ridiculous even by the below-sea-level standards of recent summer ""blockbusters"". It's difficult to believe that this movie was in any way related to the Indiana Jones trilogy.Dakota Fanning's portrayal of a spoiled child was the nearest thing to a likable character in this movie. Halfway into the movie I found myself hoping the machines would take out the rest of the main characters. I have to say that Cruise should be embarrassed that he can be so thoroughly out-shined by someone who is less than half as old as his career.In the end, I really wish I'd gone to see Batman Begins again instead.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
think of Spielberg's adaptation of War of the Worlds as his darker relative of Close Encounters,"Upon a first viewing of Steven Spielberg's latest big-action/suspense summer blockbuster War of the Worlds, I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this is what I love about going to see science-fiction thrillers. In the vein of Spielberg's best thrillers (Jurassic Park, Jaws, even Duel in some circles) not only is the story not predictable like the other dumbed down, less satisfying actioneers, but one can sense who is the real star of the film. Despite the fact that the director has a mega-star (as nutty as he may be off camera at times, Tom Cruise is dependable in good hands, better in great ones), and some supporting players who stand-out (Tim Robbins and especially Dakota Fanning), Spielberg's total control over his medium is without a missed mark. For better or sometimes worse, when one sees a film directed by him, it's not going to be standard stuff on the screen. Like Hitchcock or Kubrick or Scorsese, there's a personality coming through the storytelling, acting more often than not as a manipulator, but not in a way that cheats too much like in films that become forgotten.Examples of Spielberg's mastery of set-pieces of destruction and of stylized horror film-making can be found in, admittedly, greater Spielberg films (Jaws comes to mind, but also Jurassic Park and Minority Report too), but he's not just playing old tricks here, but still making his mis-en-scene and build-ups/pay-offs work well, very well. A prominent example to give from War of the Worlds isn't one involving the hundreds of extras on the run from the aliens, but one in an enclosed space. In one scene, which I won't reveal the circumstances to how it comes to this, Cruise, Robbins, and Fanning's characters are in a basement, and a sinister presence is surrounding them, searching, at every corner following their beats. This is the kind of scene that might be in a slightly different permutation in some of those films I mentioned before, but it doesn't lose any of its impact. The harder work- getting to care about the characters- is placed in so strongly that its hard for the scene not to work. That the pay-off in this scene, and several others, don't flounder is not just a credit to him, but to his team (i.e. editor Michael Kahn, the great cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, and of course John Williams).Truth be told, some elements of the film are almost too good or too expectable at times (such as a rather Spielbergian ending, though this may be similar to the H.G. Wells novel, un-read by me), and it is aside from Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan the most violent and riveting action-wise (as un-real as it is, somehow believable at the same time) and probably will act as more of an adrenaline rush to the younger ones. But for one who has grown up on Spielberg's films, who understood really what a director does from first watching his films, this is another fine touch to the lot. Even if you're not much of a Cruise fan it's entertaining- in fact, at the core, that's what the film wants to do with its continuous sense of urgency, to entertain the hell out of anyone, young, old, any race or creed....Having said this though, just know, it might be slightly less effective on repeat viewings, as I've come to see. 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fun if not entirely true to the book ...,"I have the unabridged audio CD for War of the Worlds from Blackstone Audio and it's very enjoyable. While this isn't true to the book, it is quite fun. The technology was state-of-the-art back then and, while you can see the strings for the martian machines, I still think it provides an enjoyable, if not nostalgic romp. Frankly, I enjoyed this more than Spielberg's newest retelling. Though, that could be from what he did to the main characters. While the special effects of the newer version are lightyears ahead of the original, I found Spielberg's recasting of the aliens as having planned this millions of years ago and putting the machines deep within the earth just plain dumb and removing one of the spookier elements of the book (and original movie).

A rather disappointing movie,"I went to see War of the Worlds yesterday. I remember enjoying the book and also the Jeff Wayne concept album (hurriedly re-mastered and re-released to coincide with the movie's release, I notice) a few years back. However, I wasn't a big fan of the first movie, brought out in the sixties. The same applies to the latest movie too. The concept of aliens invading earth has been a literary (if you can call it that) cliché and a movie cliché for a long time now and it's this that makes War of the Worlds rather dull  you know what's going to happen and you feel get a ""here-we-go-again-with this-old-chestnut"" sort of feeling  or at least I did.I also found War of the Worlds disappointing because it failed to live up to its hype. This movie has been rammed down our throats in the media for several weeks now, so I guess my expectations may have been a teensy bit too high.My opinion is that Tom Cruise was badly miscast. He just doesn't look like a working class dysfunctional father and he doesn't act one out very well either. Dakota Fanning as Rachel is far too precocious to be true and as for the one-dimensional son (Robbie)  I felt no sympathy for him whatsoever. As far as acting credits go, Tim Robbins (as Harlan) stole the show hands down, but even he struggled with a rather lifeless script. To the movie's credit, it does maintain a first person viewpoint, much like in the novel, but the movie is, if anything, far more introverted than the novel and we find ourselves examining Ray's relationship with his kids rather more than the ""Big Picture"" where we can see what the invaders are doing to human society. If Ray and his kids had been characterised better, then War of the Worlds would have had far more impact.I have to say that I expected better from Stephen Spielberg. There are few signs of his usual flair for narrating a scene in new and thought-provoking ways. The script had very little tension and I found myself getting bored around the middle of the movie. The Tripods seem like incidentals and Spielberg is so obviously overdoing the old movie technique of keeping them off shot to increase the fear factor that I ended up feeling frustrated rather than afraid.The special effects were what you might expect from a big budget movie like this but again, there's nothing new here.In my very 'umble opinion, Independence Day was the best working of the War of the Worlds idea. As far as direction and quality script are concerned it leaves this movie eating dust. There was no attempt to develop Wells' story by letting us in on the reason for the aliens' envy of our planet. Likewise, there was no attempt to convey Wells' stark social observations on human society. In this sense, Independence Day succeeded where this movie failed.All in all, I would give this movie a rather disappointing three out of a possible ten.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

After the tripods come out of the ground, they make this machine like sound that was rather creepy if I do say so myself.

I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.I was really impressed with the aliens in the movie. They were not all fake looking, yet were still freaky. Steven Spielberg didn't ruin the movie by making them huge and mean. They acted like they would on a weird and different planet.I have to say that of all the movies I have seen, this is by far one of the best when it comes to special effects.

"An edge of your seat, roller coaster of a movie!","I just came back from seeing a late show of War of the Worlds. What a movie! This film takes what we loved about the ""B"" sci-fi's of the 50's and brings the genre into the 21st century in a suspenseful and gripping way.This film does not pretend to have any ""big message"". It's simply the story of an incredibly powerful alien invasion as seen through the eyes of one family. It's a story of survival. It's a story of how you might expect humans to react under such intense pressures. And the film is visually stunning.If you're considering seeing this movie, you should. I recommend you ignore the negative reviews. I suspect many of those so called ""reviews"" were written by people with an agenda. To those IMDb members who gave this film a vote of ""1"", I find it sad that you would attempt to denigrate a film of such quality and put it into a category that is shared by films like ""Manos' the Hands of Fate"". Your vote only demonstrates that you truly are not really criticizing the film, but instead are trying to make a statement of your possible dislike for Tom Cruise or Steven Spielberg. Having said that, if all of the ""1"" votes were removed, this film would probably be at an 8.0 or greater. And that would be more representative of it's true overall rating.And to those IMDb members who complained about the little girl's screaming, what other kind of reaction should she have had? And to those members who complained that there didn't seem to be sufficient character development or that characters were not as ""likeable"" as they would have liked them to be, they don't need to be.On a side note, I think Tom Cruise has publicly acted like a jerk as of late. But it's important to keep things in their proper perspective. He's just an actor. And if he didn't get his big ""break"" years ago, he'd be someone that you might see coming up to your table in a restaurant and announcing, ""hi, I'm Tom and I'll be your server tonight"". But simply because I think Tom has gone completely off the deep end in his personal life doesn't mean that I can't look at this film objectively.This simply, is a roller coaster of a film.

War Of The Worlds ***,"Although this may not have turned out to be the ultimate alien invasion movie everyone was expecting, it is still a spectacular, exciting and, at times, frightening version of H. G. Wells' famous sci-fi classic. I don't think that comparisons should really be made between this and the 1953 original (which, in itself, possesses a nostalgic charm totally absent from Spielberg's film) because of the enormous technological advances made in the special effects field but, in retrospect, it¡¦s interesting to note that both film versions of the novel can be seen as a Hollywood riposte to a recent catastrophic event which had hit the U.S. - the Cold War in the original and the attack on the Twin Towers in the remake; as a result - and thankfully so, I might add - Spielberg's approach to the material is refreshingly sober and intelligent, closer to that seen in SIGNS (2002) than the more jingoistic one adopted for INDEPENDENCE DAY (1996). Unfortunately, the anti-climactic ""happy ending"" seems more suggestive that if you are Tom Cruise nothing bad can really happen to you, rather than the more truthful message that if the family unit stays together under times of great emotional stress, it will eventually pull through despite the hardships and the losses. That said, Tom Cruise is ideally cast as the not-so-ideal father figure and delivers the goods in that respect; however, while Dakota Fanning steals some of his limelight, her character - and especially that of her brother - were something of a liability, coming off as rather annoying and one-dimensional. Also, it was a nice touch on Spielberg's part to give bit parts to the 1953 version's original stars, Gene Barry and Ann Robinson, at the very end of the film but, as I said before, the ending was misjudged, in my opinion, if not necessarily a fatal mistake.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The message the movie was sending is clear, but there wasn't enough character development throughout the movie (nor should you expect that from this kind of film) to pull the ending off.

I must say I left the theater disappointed with the lack of tension and excitement an ""event"" film like this requires. The first 30 minutes were terrifying as the aliens begin their invasion partly due to how well Spielberg sets up the tension and payoff. The problem lies after the first act - the tension doesn't build, it either retreads the same scares over and over or decides to forgo the whole problem of aliens taking over the world to rely on mundane family problems. These problems would have been great as a breather from the action but because the action in the middle and end of the film doesn't live up to expectations, the whole movie feels longer than it should be and ultimately extremely disappointing.

An Entertaining Remake,"War of the Worlds (2005, Dir. Steven Spielberg)It's the 21st Century, and Ray Ferrier (Cruise) is trying to be a normal father to his two kids, but unbeknownst to him and the rest of the world, they are about to be attacked by beings from another world. No where is safe anymore, as Ferrier and his family must travel across the country to reach Boston.If you have seen the original version of 'The War of the Worlds', you may be tempted to check out the updated version of the tale, especially with Tom Cruise in the lead and Steven Spielberg directing. Although, the finished result is not one of Spielberg's best films, it is still highly enjoyable. The story is more complex now. As well as having the standard 'surviving' story, elements have also been introduced which revolve around family problems. Tom Cruise portrays a good father and is able to provide a good performance, however there were some lines which did come off awkwardly when Cruise said them. Dakota Fanning also further shows that she is one of the better young actresses of this current generation.

Fifty-fifty,"It was difficult to choose between a six and a seven, and I'd rather given it a 6.5, but unfortunately that's not possible.""War of the Worlds"" had great points but also very bad parts.Like you can expect from Spielberg, the special effects and the spectacle are fantastic. Most of the time I've watched the movie with my mouth open.But the story has holes where a Tripod could walk through. I mean, the movie was running for just ten minutes, and then suddenly the sky was weird, the thunder came and look: an alien! No, Stevie, that's weak.The most horrifying part of this movie wasn't the invasion of the extra-terrestrials, but it was the end. It was really the worst end I've ever seen. Why a Hollywood end? Why?! I'd rather seen that the alien had won, that would have been original.And, as an European, I have to ask: why do those Americans believe that the weird alien ships come from Europe? The American technology is much better than Europe's! But, however, if you want to see a spectacle and you want to switch your mind off, Spielberg's and Cruise's ""WAR OF THE WORLDS"" is the best you can get.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Awesome remake of the 1898 novel,"Since the last movie they made which it was Minority Report, they took the remake to an exhilarating next level in the film ""War of the Worlds"".It stars Tom Cruise, Dakota Fanning, Justin Chatwin, Tim Robbins, etc.Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) is a working class man living in New Jersey. He's estranged from his family, his life isn't in order, and he's too caught up with himself. But the unthinkable and, ultimately, the unexpected happens to him in an extraordinary sense. His small town life is shaken violently by the arrival of destructive intruders: Aliens which have come en masse to destroy Earth. As they plow through the country in a wave of mass destruction and violence, Ray must come to the defense of his children. As the world must fend for itself by a new and very advanced enemy not of this world, its inhabitants must save humanity from a far greater force that threatens to destroy it.They did a really good job remaking the classic novel, which it was written by H.G. Wells.War of the Worlds gets 10 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not as good as the 50's version!!!,"I have to say I went into this movie with huge expectations after reading heaps of stuff about it but came out somewhat disappointed after all.What I wasn't disappointed in was the incredible talent of Dakota Fanning, that young girl never fails to thrill me with her acting range and I think that as she matures she is going to be amazing.One thing that did surprise me was that I came out of the movie having found, in Tom Cruise, a new level of maturity i think. To see him play a father figure, one hell bent on looking after his kids, gave me a new insight into his acting abilities. I was very very surprised as I usually find that Tom Cruise plays Tom Cruise, but not in this movie. I really believed he was a dad trying to protect his kids at all costs.As for the movie in general, well i heard Steven Spielberg say it wasn't a remake, but, i have seen the 50's version and apart from moving this movie to another place, another time frame, well, to me it is a remake. Plain and simple... nothing different in the basic plot... a remake!The 50's version was awesome for the 50's, this was standard for this time so it wasn't anything fancy in my book. It would have rated a lot lower had it not been for the amazing acting of Tom and Dakota... as for the kid who played his son, well, i guess we can't get all the good actors can we???",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Spielberg's Antithesis To 'Close Encounters' & 'E.T.',"The first time I watched Steven Spielberg's War of the Worlds, I was severely disappointed by the anticlimactic ending and found Morgan Freeman's narration to be a cop-out, for it broke the ""show, don't tell"" golden rule. Revisiting it again, I still have issues with how the film concludes but there is a whole lot in here that I didn't appreciate or admire the last time around, not to mention that the film is far from one of Spielberg's weakest directorial efforts.The first half of War of the Worlds is a masterclass in tension building as Spielberg moves the camera around like only he can and effortlessly creates an atmosphere of post 9/11 America in an extremely effective & efficient manner. Utilising unnatural elemental forces to establish a sense of foreboding and unleashing pure terror once the board is set, the story is gripping & drama remains compelling for the most part yet the film as a whole nearly falls apart in the last act.Despite the alien invasion premise, the main focus is on the plight & predicament of a broken family and the plot covers their attempts to survive in the wake of the annihilation of the human race. Tom Cruise is impressive as the estranged father who's forced to confront his shortcomings as a parent while trying to save his children from the devastation around them to the best of his ability. Visual & Sound effects are top-notch as expected. John Williams' score however appears confused & unsure of what it wants to be.Overall, War of the Worlds is Spielberg's antithesis to Close Encounters & E.T., and finds the revered filmmaker treading into darker places. The end product is part sci-fi, part horror & part disaster that still holds back instead of going all-out and packs a potential that wasn't fully realised. The opening shot is of microbes which foreshadows the end and so Freeman's narration feels as unnecessary as it is facepalm-inducing. A promising start that loses its grip, tact & momentum in the next half, War of the Worlds still delivers an extravaganza that's worth a ride.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Just okay--not the 'summer blockbuster' I expected,"I was disappointed. Too much focus on Cruise's character's angst, not enough 'alien invasion'. I keep thinking that Spielberg had some message he wanted to convey with this, but it was lost on me because I wasn't looking for a 'message' movie about family values and the psychological effects of terrorism (post 9/11)--I went into this film expecting better than Independence Day, edge of my seat, adrenalin rush entertainment. It didn't deliver. All these reviews I read talked about what a great performance Tim Robbins did and how thought-provoking his character was. I didn't get that either. He was a wack job in a root cellar, inconsequential to the entire plot. I found myself looking at my watch an hour into this movie, wondering when it would be over. I observed about 15 people in the theater leaving at various times for bathroom runs (not a good sign). Pitiful attempt at polite applause by the theater patrons at the end. If this movie went head to head with Batman Begins for title of 'Best Movie of the Summer'--no contest--Batman would win, hands down.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Incredible Opening, Ridiculous Ending","The first 2/3 of the movie are quite good except for Dakota's incessant screaming and the absurdity of La Cruise and family being so lucky at every twist and turn. Still, the initial invasion and the challenges that follow are creepy and well-executed. Cinematography, editing and score are all solid. But then the script begins to suffer from myopia and the ending is absolutely laughable. There are aspects of the film that are classic and impossible to erase from memory. But one has to wonder how the decision makers thought the final ten minutes were the best they could provide to the audience. And what's up with so many critics lavishing praise on this film? Honestly, the way the story is wrapped up pretty much negates any of the tension that's been mounting and is far too soft a landing after some of the truly horrific set pieces that lead up to it. Ultimately, it's an enormous disappointment.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Almost needs a second viewing to get a first impression.,"I'm not sure if a second screening would benefit War of the Worlds or detract from it, but since most of us only watch films once in theatres, I suppose it should be judged on the first go around. The most impressive thing Spielberg accomplishes here is effecting fear. You might think in our multimedia world that folks would be immune to the manipulation of cinema, but sure enough when I looked down my row, my girlfriend had her hand over her mouth, the guy next to her was absentmindedly chewing on a serviette, his girlfriend's mouth was agape, etc. Whatever you might think about Spielberg, this is an impressive feat. That said, with the weapons at his disposal I honestly think he could have done more if he was willing to take some chances. The Orson Welles' version worked precisely because the world he broadcast to was not plugged in to the media. Welles capitalized on this, playing to an audience that listened to radio for both news and drama. Because they couldn't see the events described they were forced to use their imagination, which we know can be more terrifying than reality. As Marshall McLuhan would say, the medium was the message. But in a world of 1000 TV channels, live Internet streaming and embedded war reporters, a film must truly do something remarkable to transcend the medium. Perhaps this is why Hollywood is in such a slump: they keep trying twists on the same narrative structures, and people are willing to stay home and wait for these stories. If ever a movie called out for some experimentation to rattle the audience's cage, this is the one. Films like Elephant, Gerry, 5 x 2, Memento, Irreversible and 21 Grams are the future of cinematic narrative because they challenge and force a viewer to participate. As impressive as the references and special effects are here, this is a movie you can set your watch to  even if some electromagnetic pulse manages to stop it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Superb Movie but not a good ending,"Everything till the end was great about the movie. It was very fun to watch. However, for the ending, they either weren't thinking or they figured the movie was going on too long and thought of ending it fast. Now, in the beginning of the movie the machines that came underneath the ground had shields that rendered them immune to our attacks and all throughout that point we've been fighting a lost war. But at the end, they showed the birds flying around these machines and making the pilots blind. My question is how could the birds fly so close to these machines when their shields can literally fry them. Secondly, I saw a rocket able to penetrate their shields while they were flying blind at the end of the movie. How could their shields possibly go down? This didn't made sense and the whole ending wasn't making sense either. But overall if you enjoy thriller and suspense and Sci-Fi fictions then this is the movie for you.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
who liked this movie?,"Maybe had I not read the book, or seen the 50's movie, or had any expectation that the movie would be the least bit good, it may have been OK. I will not even rent it when it comes out. Dumb.The book is considered a literary masterpiece because it had an awesome story. There's no story to this movie other than the obvious, aliens attack. This film has Tom Cruise running around scared the whole time with kids you kind of hope the aliens kill anyway. This had me wanting the aliens to zap cruise, the earth would have been better for it. And no, I don't hate Cruise, I was blown away by his part in 'Collateral'. Even though I expected WotW was going to be bad, I somehow thought Tom could save it.If you haven't read the book, or seen the 1953 movie, or you are easily impressed by bright, shiny objects, you will probably like this movie.The 1953 movie is waaaaaay better story-wise, and not bad effects considering the year.

Tom can run,"War of the Worlds I debated whether skipping this for a time just because it was a remake of an old classic I had seen and remakes rarely live up to, let alone surpass the originals. For those others not old enough to recall, the original was made in 1953 and starred Gene Barry, later to go on to greater fame as the star of TV's western series ""Bat Masterson (1958)"" and ""Burke's Law (1963)"". But boredom and a night wanting to escape reality won out, so I went on opening night, something I almost never do because of the crowds. As it was the theater was sold out all but the last showing, so guess how late I stayed up on a work night? Anyway... I digress... I was prepared to be disappointed.Let's address the obvious first. Well, the script didn't exactly follow the book (which I read as a young boy along with the rest of Well's works) but it's likely better given the medium here. The screenplay did a rather great job of updating the old classic's story line to something that at least seemed plausible, given the theme. For that bit of slight-of-keyboard one must give thanks to Josh Friedman, who ""consulted on the recently enjoyable ""Sahara"" but seems to have few other credits to boast of. His list should rightfully grow after this effort, all masterfully photographed by the stunningly talented cinematographer Janusz Kaminski (another Oscar for him perhaps?).After the story, to build a good, never mind great, Sci Fi piece, we must have adequate sets, art direction and costuming. These were all top notch and also fit the film quite well. Some of the ""looks"" of the sets here are Oscar worthy in scale, scope and ambition so we should hear more in the future about this effort.Next, one must mention the efforts of the director, the legendary Steven Spielberg. I think he elicited perhaps the best performance to date from Tom Cruise and excellent performances from Tim Robbins and the young Ms. Dakota Fanning. Their performances are somewhat limited by the type of story it is, but they all do extremely well in making it a great movie. Watch for Gene Barry, the star of the original film, making a cameo appearance near the end of the film (apparently Tom Cruise's character's ex-father-in-law). The one thing that is hard to do is introduce anything in this kind of a story, where all of humanity is so completely devastated by the invaders. The character Cruise plays would be very difficult for any actor as they made him a pretty unsympathetic blue collar/red-neck type of a shiftless ruffian; a failed ex-husband and what appears a joke as a father. Still, with all of that going against him, Cruise manages to make us root for his character. In the end I think they went a bit overboard in trying to make him look like just an ordinary guy who still manages to somehow survive the unthinkable against all the odds. The nuances in his performance will likely be missed or misunderstood by many, especially by his leagues of fluttering femme fans.Last, but certainly not least in this genre, are the special effects. Here, all the stops are pulled and there are some great effects that contribute to the finished product in the best possible way. Sitting in the audience of a packed theater I could feel the audience react en-mass to many of them.All-in-all, the producers delivered what is likely better than the original, thoroughly entertaining and definitely worth the price of admission. It is classic Science Fiction in it's rawest manifestation so it may not be favorite of general movie goers, but as I filed out of the theater with the pressing throng (I seemed to be one of the VERY few people in the theater OVER the age of 20) I heard many patrons speak positively of it. I can recommend it, especially to Sci Fi fans.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A sometimes tense, yet poorly executed piece","Steven Spielberg's name has more or less become quite kitsch over the last few years, but you can always credit him for making a film that was well put together and constructed. War of the Worlds will most likely be considered a blip on his resume due to the fact he couldn't follow that example.There were moments where it looked like this film would become a great movie, but the sloppiness of the production was quite apparent. This was a money-maker, and it didn't matter what happened as long as they got their money in return. While the effects and Janusz Kaminski's cinematography were pretty on par, other elements like the script and the acting were too much to overcome. Tom Cruise didn't have to act much in this film, but he lacked any real range of emotions. His lack of character seemed to be apparent within the film, something that falls on all of the characters, especially Robbie, who is played by Justin Chatwin. David Koepp, who wrote a rather beguiling script that was high on concept and low on meaning, seems to be stumbling a lot these days considering his last few scripts have been trite and lacking real depth.What really saved this film was the special effects and the sound editing, which was expected. The walking machines were faithfully reproduced unlike the original film, satisfying more hardcore fans of the book (like myself).War of the Worlds will get its share of mixed reviews, and that's to be expected considering how bi-polar the film gets. Is it anti-war? Is it pro-family? Is it about community or looking out for No. 1? Just when you think it will go one way, it goes the other.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Spielberg's disaster movie, with aliens","It had to happen eventually. After all the nice misunderstood aliens with their musical communication and their glowing fingers, Spielberg had to snap. And snap he did. With War of the Worlds, Spielberg introduced his next alien--the ones that kill indiscriminately with multicolored ray-guns and tentacles and want to, as Brain would say, ""...take over the world."" I think Spielberg is in a bit of a slump. He's been making decent movies, but it seems like his originality and storytelling has been getting increasingly weaker. I mean, I don't expect him to turn out complete garbage, but he's not quite at the level where he used to be. War of the Worlds is an example of this. The story to War of the Worlds is highly episodic and seemingly disjointed. In fact, there isn't a great deal of character development, but we just follow one family as it survives an annihilation. From one episode of escaping the big baddies to another.I think there is some small amount of commentary about the fallen nature of humanity, but the movie, though seemingly taken from the original source (this is hearsay), also seems to miss out on some of the contextuality of the original. The book was written in the late 19th century admist colonialism, the roots of the industrial revolution and so forth. Whereas Spielberg did a passing job addressing matters of science fiction and social issues in Minority Report, he misses the boat with War of the Worlds.When the movie ends, you're sort of left with a ""that's it?"" experience--because there doesn't seem to be any serious underlying theme to the film. Even the sense of loss that the film tries to permeate early on is eradicated by the film's relatively too-happy ending.But the special effects are mostly impressive, the destruction is frightening enough that there were people in there theater that were becoming obviously agitated and I can't say that the direction and editing were particularly lacking. The acting by Tom Cruise was, well, it looked like it was Tom Cruise in a alien invasion movie. The children were a bit more believable and the rest of the characters are side notes, although Tim Robbins makes an impression, although not necessarily for the better.Oh yeah, the film also opens with Morgan Freeman, doing a voice-over. Nowhere in the movie do we see Morgan Freeman. He's just a voice that's telling us a story. And the voice-over bookending to the story is a cheap way of not having to show a story--it just tells it. There are also a whole lot of inconsistencies in the movie, especially revolving around the electro-magnetic pulse story-element, but that's a side-note that techies and science fiction nerds will notice.In the end, it's a watchable experience, but it won't leave you satisfied--although it will disturb or entertain some viewers enough that it will be ""good enough"" movie going experience. Way below greatness, but better than average. I can't recommend it, but if you want to watch an alien invasion movie, this is better than Independence Day. In terms of science fiction--this is not good science fiction, even Arnold the Gubernator in the Terminator movies, is superior--those at least dealt with themes of fate and humanity's self-destruction.This is essentially a disaster movie with aliens. Like many disaster movies, it fails to address the people and focuses too much on the disaster. And so disaster movies become disasters.Let's hope Spielberg finds whatever spark in him that caused him to make his better movies. Auto-pilot doesn't suit him. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great first half crap second.,"I thought I was in for a treat when this movie got going.It got straight to the action and no messing about with sub plots(there is a kind of sub plot but it doesn't hold the movie back in any way. The lightning strikes were terrific and the alien/robot out of the drain was good but then after the first 45 minutes, the movie slows down completely focusing on Tom Cruise and his family issues. It also gets incredibly unbelievable during the last 3 or 4 scenes as the robots seem grow hands and reach around corners. one scene in particular is really stupid When Tom Cruise and his son hide out in a cabin underground, the roots should leave them, but they make a point of searching for Cruise.

Striking Story !,"War of the Worlds was really Entertaining.

He is very good at portraying the Human frailty and Desperation. Tim robbins looks like the psycho prima facie. But its a gruelling revelation of how the common man might react in the face of a catastrophe .

Huge Disappointment,"For all of its nonstop action set pieces and narrow escapes, ""War of the Worlds"" is a strangely inert piece of film-making. There's absolutely nothing in the film to retain your interest. Tom Cruise plays a completely anonymous character who you learn nothing about, and his kids serve little purpose beyond being mere plot devices and giving Tom Cruise something to do besides save himself. Steven Spielberg directs this film with a grim relentlessness; there are scenes to frighten and disturb, but there is absolutely no sense of fun. It's as if he brought the same sensibility he did to ""Saving Private Ryan"" to this film, but here the approach and the material don't match. ""Private Ryan"" was about an actual event, and there was some value in depicting it as realistically and disturbingly as possible so that those of us who've never lived through something similar might be less inclined to treat the subject casually. But come on--this is an alien-invasion flick, the stuff of pure fantasy. Spielberg's obvious efforts to take advantage of the movie-going public's post-9/11 jumpiness seems calculated and rather tasteless.There's no point to talk about the acting, since there isn't any. But I do have to mention Tim Robbins, who gives a ghastly performance in a pointless role. His minimal storyline should have been left on the cutting room floor, with much of the rest of this film.This is one of those movies that doesn't even follow its own logic; the kind where all electronic devices stop working, until someone needs to be able to use a cell phone for the convenience of the plot, and then miraculously their phone works. I was actually quite surprised at how bad this movie was. It's shoddy storytelling, which is not what I've come to expect from Spielberg. He's never been one of my favorite directors, but I've always given him credit for being far more capable than he is here. Maybe he was just directing this film to pass the time before ""Munich"" (his Oscar-bait movie of the year) was ready to start filming. Whatever the reason, his heart was obviously not in this one.Grade: D (some splashy visual effects prevent it from receiving an F rating)",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spielberg's triumphant return to fun film-making.,"Between the quality, yet wholly depressing films such as 'Schiendler's List' and 'Saving Private Ryan' and the perky, but bad films like 'Lost World' and 'AI' (my vote for worst studio film ever) I was beginning to worry that Spielberg had forgotten how to make a fun movie. Fears put to rest, he has remembered after all.The story is the stuff of Sci-Fi legend, so only a brief synopsis: aliens invade earth and set about eliminating the human race. Unable to stop the hulking machines of war, mankind must find a way to survive the onslaught.The stops are all pulled for this magnum opus of a movie. The scenes of destruction are so massive to as defy believe, yet so expertly executed to fell all to gut-wrenchingly real. The first appearance of the alien menace is a scene of awe; it inspires excitement the likes of which I haven't felt since Spielberg brought dinosaurs back to life in 'Jurassic Park'. The film's obvious selling point is it's look and nearly facet of it's appearance is perfect. Starting from an ever moving camera, moving into the color and lighting, transitioning to angle and shot choice, and finishing off with startlingly realistic SFX; the movie looks amazing.Were the look all the film had going for it, it would still have been a failure (see 'Day After Tomorrow', 'Dante's Peak', etc.) but the film pulls a bait-n-switch and elects to focus on a tighter human element rather than a global picture. Similar to how M. Night Shyamalan constructed his alien invasion film 'Signs', Spielberg's end-of-the-world tale centers on the survival of a divorced father and his children as they attempt to outrun the mayhem. Matters are made more difficult for them as the father (Cruise) is disillusioned and angry and his children neither know him well nor particularly care to. The family dynamic takes as much precedence in the story as the mass destruction.Which brings up the films only real flaw, that in the form of lack of intention. When the film begins, the audience is introduced to the characters and the conflicts, but just as they are coming into focus the invasion begins and things get put on hold. Just about the time the audience is now settling into action mode, the film down shifts back to character drama and viewers are left missing the devastation.I call it a flaw, but it really is inherent to the material. The Orson Wells' radio broadcast followed much the same pattern, as did the 1953 movie of the same name. Just know that for every big moment you get there will be equal time spent watching people huddle together in basements being terrified.A character drama disguised as a Sci-Fi action/horror film, 'War of the Worlds' is classic Spielberg fun.9/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Entertainment as it should be,"This is the Dakota and Tom show, with the latter graciously conceding to the little starlet. Cruise pretty much lets Fanning steal the shared scenes - why even bother to compete with such a cute and adorable child?! Fair play to him, and well done Dakota, despite being a tad heavy in the trademark ""hysterical screaming banshee"" mode.She may have to try harder to keep up with Cruise, who literally does live up to his name by effortlessly cruising through this, but she shows depth of talent and is obviously at ease in front of a camera, and in front of one of the biggest movie stars of the last 20 years.With so much action and CGI on display, it would be easy to sit back and let the tech boys make the movie for them, but all the main players really turn on the style here. Add in that stunning action and cinematography (minus the usual gratuitous violence and gore) and expert direction and editing, and we have here a very slick, polished and visually exciting movie.They really don't get any better than this - movies are primarily meant to entertain, and anyone not entertained by this must be a very jaded person indeed.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The movie had an incredible intensity to it, that really pulls you into the movie, but that's where the movie falls short.I guess it's hard in a post 9/11 society to view disaster in a such a personal way.There are some great moments and a lot of good quotes from this movie. I don't know if this movie is awesome, or if I'm just disappointed since it was a Spielberg flick that it wasn't better. I'm on the fence here.I would recommend that you go and see this movie, because it is a GOOD movie. It's not going to go down in history like E.T., but it will be remembered.Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning were a perfect casting for the father and daughter parts. You see a new depth to Tom Cruise's acting ability in this movie. And for those of you who have been following Dakota...she's great as usual. It's about time she wins an Academy Award. How many good movies must she make before she gets her respect as a child actor. She is clearly the best Actor under 18 hands down!

Spielberg of my dreams.,"I'm not a movie-maker but I dream. For instance I saw Spielberg's ""war of the worlds"" and dreamed I was his assistant when he made it. I know it is presumptuous but it's just a dream okay? In this dream, in order to assist him I got to ask him a few questions. I asked him how he felt about directing his first bad alien movie and why this particular story. He answered that everything has its part of darkness and so has extra-terrestrial life, that today's public wasn't curious enough about some great works of the past, that new technology had given meaning to the word ""remake"" and that a remake, more up to today's world could bring out of this story something both really exciting and very profitable.Whoa! In my dream I started daydreaming about a pessimistic pendant to ""Encounters of the third kind"". It put me on a little cloud knowing I was part of it.I got the script and as it was expected of me rose some points needing changes, or some explanation and made a list like so: 1- With the Tsunami experience we know people do not understand danger is here and completely lack self preservation instincts, but here it says the street has been hit by lightning, then starts collapsing, cracking, erupting, the buildings are too; a very odd looking flying machine comes out of this quickly followed by another this time standing on three feet, still people do not try establishing any safe distance with the phenomenon until they start being vaporized. I know people are weird in the face of danger, but I think this may not work. How about most of the people flee and only some cops because it's their duty and some idiots because they're idiots should show some bravado (and Tom included as his character at that point in the movie is one of an idiot).2- The EMP has disabled any electronic device, the camcorder should not work, period. I'm sure the line has escaped you and was written by someone who didn't know and forgot to read the beginning of the script when they explain it.3- The TV crew engages conversation, shows Tom footage a little too easily to then leave him as if he were nothing. Also, when in a plush suburb of NYC at the end of the world, having to choose between breaking into a freshly deserted house and climbing on a still sizzling crashed B747 full of cadavers to look for water, my choice would be in favor of the house. The other things with this scene are how can the street remain practicable for a car? And why is Tom's car still intact? 4- On the hill, why are all the people running towards the front line? If they're fleeing from something it will not be obvious for the audience as the army clearly defines it as a front line. The text between Tom and his son should be re-written for something more coherent and shorter, we should hire really convincing actors for the couple who tries to abduct/save Tom's daughter or shorten their scene too. It will seem more realistic in the context of a battle. Tom seems to again fail death with uncommon good luck (not to speak of his son's). If we put them all a little further away from the action, it will keep the latter where it should be: not showing too much, too close.5- There is a clear paradox between the seemingly paramount blood sucking routine of the second part and the obvious vaporizing waste of the beginning. If there is a rationale, then it isn't clear.6- The family reunion looks a little too much like one, we should make it differently, maybe the son is dead, or maybe the mother died, like in she went to NYC to get her children because she knew her ex-husband is such a loser he wouldn't have done anything to help, even less take the trip to Boston and she would have met a tragic but beautiful death saving someone when she realizes her kids are probably dead... In short something more Shakespearian...7- The end makes the germs an enemy we learned to live with... How about the germs learned how to live with us? How about changing the trailer catch phrase to ""the last war on Earth will not be won by humans""? This victory we witness and which was already in the original story by Wells, isn't it the planet's victory? Shouldn't the message be one of respect and awe for the might of the planet? Not only protecting us from the void and the radiations but giving us air and defense against the Extra-Terrestrials?It's just a start but I think we could focus on a few more things just to deepen the whole thing and make it more likely to satisfy the crowds who are only asking to believe what they see, even if only for 2 hours. So tell me Mr. Spielberg, what do you think? I asked him as soon as he read my notes. He said, Wow, well, yeah Ben, this makes sense, I'm so overwhelmed by life and so used to people licking my *** that I've lost my own critical view and you are the kind of person I really need to get back to my good work without turning my back on good life, thank you so muchThat's when I woke up with my wife staring at me like she always does when I sleep talk and then she said: Ben, I like your movie better (hey, that's my wife, so I can't expect much objectivity from her), I kissed her and we went back to sleep but as I was falling asleep I thought, You're wrong my love, it's not my movie that's better, it's my Spielberg.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
War of the Worlds,I totally loved this movie!!! I'm a big Sci-Fi fan and this movie scare the hell out of me in the theater. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. The sound effects were absolutely amazing and drew me into the movie. Plus the camera angles made a lot of the scenes very believable because they were from the ground up. The only think I would have changed was the lighting. It was somewhat distracting. I understand that the lighting effect was done to intensify the idea that some areas were in total darkness and others weren't but the halo effect around the lights was unnecessary and overused. That's it. The design of the tripods and aliens was totally amazing!!!! The digerido sound effect was freightening...I say bring on more sci-fi like this Spielberg....I live for it!!!!,10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
War of the Worst,"If you like great visuals this is the film for you, if you want a movie that actually has a story, best save your dollars. It is no wonder that Hollywood is in the midst of a summer of dread - they have forgotten that stories are actually important. Spielberg used to be a masterful storyteller, but films like this make him look like a sell out. The visuals were great, but great visuals do not make a great film. The plot is loaded with forced emotions, too many holes to mention, some creepy character (yes Tim Robbins, I'm talking about you), too much over acting by Dakota Fanning and Tom Cruise, and an ending that seems tagged on just to tie up all the loose ends. At the beginning there was a lot of hope for this film, some genuinely creepy moments, but in the end the movie wasn't even worth the popcorn I ate. My recommendation? Stay home, or better yet catch a truly worthy movie like Batman Begins or Cinderella Man.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Reason to Recall the Impact of H.G. Well's Apocalyptic Book,"The real dazzler about this reincarnation of an old story is that it IS the reincarnation of an old story. H.G. Wells published his scary sci-fi novel in 1898, Orson Welles terrified the country in his 1938 radio drama version of the book, in 1953 the book became a film, and now in the time of terrorism Steven Spielberg makes the story not an invasion from Mars but an enemy from within the bowels of the globe. Quite a fest for a book over a hundred years old to still seem pertinent.Steven Spielberg once again proves he can outdo most anyone with costly productions. His style is evident from the first moments when the actions seems centered on the broken family of Ray (Tom Cruise) and his ex-wife Maryann (Miranda Otto) as she leaves their children Rachel (Dakota Fanning) and Ray (Justin Chatwin) with Ray in New Jersey while Maryann and her new husband take a trip to Boston. The tension is obvious: Ray is not a father-type and finds communication with his children tedious at best. The Spielberg family drama recipe is set.The action starts almost immediately with newscasts of electrical field disturbances on the media and then the occurrence of lightning without thunder in New Jersey. In rapid motion the etiology of the altered weather is seen to be the emergence out of the ground of huge tripod machines that destroy everything in sight (""Is it terrorists?"" Rachel repeatedly asks, driving home the underlying tone of Spielberg's intention of making the story relevant to our time). New Jersey is destroyed but Ray and the kids find a car that works and drives toward Boston for reconciliation with Maryann. What happens between New Jersey and Boston is a battle to end all battles during which time Ray discovers the importance of his fatherhood, the love of his children, and his own humbling recognition that he is but one member of the planet earth.The stars of the film are the extraordinary tripod machines, though Cruise and Fanning hold their own. One leaves the film feeling it could have had more impact had it stuck more closely to the book, but then that's been done before. Grady Harp",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Reoccuring War of Book to Movie; A Synopsis,"Spielberg and Cruise endeavor on their second bout of sci-fi high powered cinema with obvious pizazz and flare, delivering an extremely entertaining roller-coaster ride with a sudden, unsettling end. The entertainment factor was fantastic. In the theater I found myself experiencing an almost archetypal montage of fundamental reactions translated to physical glee. I cringed with fear at the scary parts, was dazed at the visual shockers, and was appropriately disturbed by what seemed like an apocalyptic holocaust delivered by enormous, super mean aliens. Although rated PG-13, I feel inclined to warn all parents to weigh War of the Worlds on par with Schindler's List and Sophie's Choice before making decisions about going on a family viewing.Having read the a comment which sited that the fairy-tale ending was loyal to H.G. Well's original book, I feel uncomfortable and yet justified in saying that sometimes movies are better when you delineate between what is verbally appealing and what is theatrically appealing. An example could be LOTR; in the books, there is a huge segment about Saromaun (sp????) in which he ventures into Hobbiton with Wormtongue and proceeds to corrupt and violate everything, only to be later stopped by the four protagonist hobbits (after they destroy the ring and everything). Considering the length of the movie, Peter Jackson killed off Saromaun and Wormtongue instead, writing a totally fabricated death scene just to eliminate what could have been a five-hour film or a four movie series. The same philosophy of cut-and-write should have been applied to War of the Worlds. While the ending might have been satisfying in the book (please note I have not read it yet) the ending on screen was absolutely confusing, and left both me and my fellows with an unresolved, almost hurt feeling of disappointment.Despite the disappointing ending, and several other blimps too trivial to note, WOTW was a fantastic ride. Spielberg has a real talent for intertwining the scariest imagery possible with little bits of comic relief which at many intervals of the film provoke a welcome grin to override my otherwise horrified gaze. And it was such fun to see the usually spiffied up, arrogant Tom Cruise walking around in a Yankees cap and jeans, battling with estranged son and daughter as aliens take over the world. The character development (Cruise, Fanning...) and beautifully subtle relationship of father and children struggling amidst detritus of divorce and Apocalypse acted as a binding glue which made the chemistry of the movie spark. Spielberg nailed the sentimentality aspect, which isn't a surprise; he's proved to be a trooper.Good movie, bad ending, scary kids, great ride.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
wow! i was impressed!,"thoroughly entertaining, not a merely a ""tom cruise"" vehicle. not just a ""special effects/summer"" movie either. this one had heart and soul and felt totally believable from the start! i thought ""tom cruise"" for the first three minutes of the movie and then he was ""ray ferrier"", inept and absent father taking care of his estranged kids for the weekend, but boy, do circumstances change from there! to tell ya the truth, this movie didn't seem like something other-worldly to me. i kept thinking, wow, this could happen, i could be in the this totally awful, unpredictable situation......the references to terrorists and wars, put things in a contemporary place. the special effects were numbingly good. i think my mouth was on my knees through-out this flick...........i didn't breathe much for the entire movie. what's going to happen next?? the human element, the feelings of danger, and ""do anything you have to in order to survive"" was palatable. the change in tom's character and his relationship with his children over the course of the movie was a joy to watch. thoroughly enjoyed this one. thank you tom and steven for high-caliber, non-stop entertainment with a heart!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What a load of ...,"It truly takes a serious talent to make a movie so bad. Ed Wood would be jealous of Steven's latest cinematic vomit.Dakota Fanning is a good actor. Unfortunately her role in this movie is to annoy everyone and acting like an idiot. Her brother in the movie is a retard with no discipline or any sort of understanding of his surroundings. You just do not act out like the kids did in this movie, without getting some sense beaten into you. Cruise was quite bad in this one also...I loved him in Magnolia, and he has done some roles where his actual skills were needed, but this time he just tried to look scared and confused and dumb. I guess he did that, but does that count for great acting? His character was a spineless git who could not even control two little children in time of crisis...the kids walked all over him and made surviving a real task.Major plot holes, horrible characters, no feeling...just a waste of money and talent. I'll give this trash 1/10 because there is no option for -10 etc. As bad as Independence day and Pearl Harbor, though this had less pro-American propaganda.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The best film of 2005, in my opinion","As this was one of the more memorable films I saw in 2005, and as it was also one of the most obviously flawed, I was afraid it would be worse upon a revisiting. I'm glad to say I was entirely wrong about that. It got better. In fact, when you know the flaws are coming, it's easier to concentrate on its strengths. I'm starting to think this could be Spielberg's best film. I don't think its themes, its intentions, or its results have been completely considered by either the director of the screenwriters, so the messages it emits are mixed. But I think that makes the film all the more interesting. In Munich, Spielberg's far more critically lauded film of 2005, we are told what to think at every juncture. War of the Worlds emotes and informs at a more intuitive level. There's a lot more to think about with this film than pretty much any other film the man has ever made. The logic of the film is often flawed, but the images and the feelings they produce are palpable. Is it just utilizing the post-9/11 zeitgeist to create an entertaining actioner? I think it's deeper than that, certainly. It is an action film, a summer blockbuster, but it's more deeply felt than any other I can think of. It's entertaining, but it's not the kind of film that you can walk away from feeling good. I think that's one of the main reasons for its failure with much of the audience. Whatever the case, this is the most memorable and effective film of the year, and I am now confidently ranking this as the best film of 2005.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Awesome Wells?,"The vast, cool and unsympathetic intelligence responsible for this latest version of H.G Wells story is a little too good at recreating the author's cold lesson in human humility. In many respects its a success - the relocation to modern day America works perfectly because its the superpower of the moment, as much the centre of present day civilisation as Wells' Victorian England. Therefore there's no better place on Earth for a bit of otherworldly extermination, no better backdrop to see social order breakdown and people take on the animal mentality that the author cynically described in his original Novella. Spielberg's decision to keep the invasion grounded from one character's perspective is also a smart move. Not only is this faithful to the old narrative but it manages to effortlessly dodge all the old alien invasion movie clichés, ensuring this isn't just a serious version of Mars Attacks. So as an update it works quite well and allows the Sugarland Express director to indulge in his talent for show-stopping spectacle and psychological giggery-pokery. So why only 6/10? Because Worlds is just a shade too cold for its own good. The diminutive Cruiser is fine but ONLY fine and Dakota Fanning continues to impress but on this occasion Spielberg's favourite old stand-by, the dysfunctional family doesn't deliver the goods, initially because we've hardly got to know them before they're on the run and that they're all just a little bit slight and uninvolving. The 'Berg is the real star of the show as he often is, handling the material with his usual deft touch and efficiency but this time, bereft of any emotional core, it plays in a fairly so-so kind of fashion. Technically there's no problem here but about an hour after this ended I caught Close Encounters on T.V and realised and what this movie lacked was all there - Warm Characterisation, a bit of breathing space to invest in the protagonists, a mountain of mash potato and a highly effective score by John Williams who here is disappointingly anonymous. Wells was famously dissatisfied with most adaptations of his work but I think he would have had a hard time deriding this one - the problem is that for once, a little modification might have brought it up a few notches.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Was that as good as he could do?,"War of the Worlds was an enjoyable film. Its very entertaining and keeps you involved throughout the entire movie. The ending was not the best. There were many holes in the story. If you watch the film, its awesome. But if you sit and think about what is going on through the movie and listen to the story, there are far too many holes. Personally, Spielberg did a good job, but I expected more from him. Go see it for yourself and find out. But when you see it, pay close attention to the things that are said in the beginning and see if they truly play out to add or take away from the actual film.

Only Spielberg can do it.,"This is an excellent job that only Steven Spielberg can bring to life. I haven't seen his previous version from this movie, even we are in a high technology effects times this version of The War of The Worlds is a genuine gem of the seventh art. When I first saw the movie I was sort of disappointed about the ending, but some things can not be changed in a remake nor on an adapted film. This movie could transport me several times, a fact that is very important when you sit at a theater.

E.T. Stay Home!,"Steven Spielberg's third 'from out of this world' opus is just one big mess. It's difficult to understand how the man who gave us the charm of E.T. and the humanity of Close Encounters could deliver such pathetic junk. The biggest problem in this film is a script so lacking in coherency that it's writing seems better suited to one of those bad 50's B sci-fi movies. (I think I just heard H. G. Wells roll around in his grave for the umpteenth time.)The other big problem is the lack of empathy one feels for the characters. Cruise's daughter is so annoying I almost wished one of the tripods would put that screeching presence out of her misery. And what's with Tim Robbins? His hammy performance was the only true bit of humor to be found anywhere.Granted, the special effects are great and one should not expect any big statement on the human condition from big budget sci-fi, but we're talking Spielberg here. One anticipates not only a good show but a superior narrative from a good storyteller. On the positive side, the director goes for a much grittier look (a la Saving Private Ryan) which is appropriate for the subject matter. However, maybe the movie would have worked better had it expanded the story to involve more characters and encompassed more the broader effect of the invasion outside of Cruise's family.All in all, a total waste of talent and an even clunkier mess than the marauding invading aliens.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A solid Spielberg attempt.,"Steven Spielberg has a great view of the sci-fi genre...because it is different. He takes on projects as Close Encounters, E.T. and the incredibly underrated A.I., and he gives it the Spielberg spin on them. They make you cry...Except War of the Worlds. This gives a great view of the effects that occurred, and they were through Tom Cruise's eyes. Following him and his family really gives a solid view of the magnitude of the events that occur, and they are staggering. The Tripods are worth waiting for, and scary as all get-out. The SFX here are as quality, if not better, as LOTR and the new Star Wars series. The one pleasant surprise was Dakota Fanning. She played the start to finish as concentrating on each moment, and they all pay off. Great work.It wasn't A.I., but Spielberg adds another solid work in his sci-fi stuff.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A disappointment...,"The ending was bad and the plot had holes. The acting was okay but it was all action. The special effects were good but it was so lacking in plot. Plus the ""aliens"" were so cliché looking and they added some very pointless and uninteresting characters. There was one character who seemed to be just pure filler. He added nothing to the plot and was nothing but an annoyance. I have to give Dakota Fanning credit, once again she did well in this movie. Tom Cruise gave his usual performance, he plays the same character in every movie, almost like Keanu Reeves, who seems to be stuck in an ""excellent adventure"". To put it simply, the whole movie reminded me of the second Matrix in that the entire thing was pointless action in which they attempted to cram the tiny bit of plot into a five minute scene. I guess you could say that I was very disappointed and I wouldn't recommend this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"More ""WOW"" than ""wow""","The combination of director Steven Spielberg and actor Tom Cruise - last paired in ""Minority Report"" - promises much and the vehicle of the 1898 H G Wells novel ""The War Of The Worlds"" seems like an exciting basis for their undoubted talents. The basic elements of the original story are retained, notably an alien tripod invasion of Earth with a Morgan Freeman opening narration quoting the first words of the novel and the ultimate defeat of the invaders through the same mechanism as offered by Wells. The transposition from late 19th century England to early 21st century United States is understandable commercially, but the abandonment of any mention of Mars and the absurd notion of aliens descending down lightning bolts to inhabit huge vehicles buried long, long ago weaken the credibility of the plot. A sequence involving Tim Robbins as a crazy survivalist (especially a cringe-inducing effort to sing a children's song) is also misplaced and unpleasant.However, Cruise as always is very watchable and here dispenses with any special bravery or skills to portray a confused father desperately trying to save his two children, constantly scared, confused and on the run. Eleven year old Dakota Fanning is so good as his daughter that she is in danger of becoming the star of the movie. Where ""WOW"" scores big time - and I mean BIG time - is in the 400+ special effects generated by Industrial Light and Magic The opening sequence when the first tripod erupts from the city streets is brilliant and other scenes - notably the crashing of a Boeing 747 - are the exciting visions and sounds that beg to be witnessed on a large screen. This is Spielberg much more in ""Jaws"" and ""Jurassic Park"" mode than ""ET"" and ""Close Encounters"", but in the end it is more a case of ""WOW"" than ""wow"".",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Similar to the book in many ways,"I saw this movie at the theatre and loved it. Tom Cruise being a bit of a dick aside, I enjoyed the way the plot seemed to be staying close to the plot of the book. Well, OK, it's set about a hundred years later, and in America too, but Spielberg chose a lot of it (at least, the final scene, to me) to be set in a rather 'english' part of America. I wasn't sure about the martian machines being underground all this time, either.However, the same elements and scenes from the original book appeared to be preserved as well: the sense of absolute shock and horror, the uselessness of the efforts of the military, the scene on the ferry, the scene trapped under the house with Ogilvy. I particularly liked the final scenes, where the birds are landing on the martians' machines. It brought home the feeling that earthly nature had won out.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spielberg's war protest film(?),"Don't be fooled by my seemingly high rating for this film. This one was a big disappointment for me. It's just one of those films that, after having seen it, I found...unnecessary. Even from the first time I saw the teaser trailers I thought, how is this in any way different from ""Independence Day?"" Then the Super Bowl ads piqued my interest and my anticipation grew. It looked like it would be what Independence Day wasn't--a grim tail of invasion that pulled no punches. This one might actually be scary. but then, I thought, we got scary aliens (or creepy at the very least) in Shyamalan's ""Signs"" 3 years ago. How then can Spielberg's HG Wells update stand apart?Well, it does begin with a lot of intensity. Aliens start vaporizing people within the first 20 minutes, right after some character introductions. I found it interesting that the aliens' Beams of Fury (my name) were very similar to the ""spray of sparks"" from the 1953 original--which at the time must have been terrifying in themselves. ""War"" circa 2005 shares many common traits with the original film but probably only because both are adapted from the same book.After the invasion from below begins, Spielberg maintains the level of intensity throughout...which becomes a problem. The intensity never lets up enough to create genuine fright. You need to let people breathe easy for a while, then let them have it, then repeat. ""War of the Worlds"" is all peaks, no valleys.Other than never letting up, it never lightens up either. There is little humor to be found in this, making it not much fun. That's trouble, during the summer season especially.Spielberg seems intent on giving audiences a study of fear in an age of terrorism. For a time, this works. But the suspension of disbelief, at least for me, expired early on this one. Few of us are genuinely afraid of an alien invasion. But most people these days are afraid of terrorism. The invasion analogy worked well in 1953 but doesn't work now...or does it?Perhaps the invaders in the analogy aren't terrorists at all but American planes and bombs. Let's do a little calendar pointing. A year ago Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg had openings in their schedules at the same time. The Iraq occupation had by that time become a hellish nightmare. So this project that had been a blip on both men's radars now was possible. And what's better, it had a context. But perhaps the assumed terrorists = aliens analogy was too simple. In 2003 we had a massive invasion, followed by uncertainty and destabilization, followed by hell (which Iraq still is anywhere outside the Green Zone).So ""War"" may not be a protest film, but may well symbolize the violence and chaos that we have been seeing for over two years now in Iraq. We witnessed a normal society in which people felt relatively safe walking around on the streets, thrown into chaos by an invasion that few there understood. All they want is for life to go back to normal again.Sounds like a movie I just saw.For what it's worth, I'd rank the big alien invasion films of the last decade as follows: 1. ""Signs"" 2. ""Independence Day"" 3. ""War of the Worlds""",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A mind-blowing yet chilling experience,"Quite possibly the best film i have seen in a long time. Possibly Spielbergs best so far. Choosing to focus on the small family figures is far more emotional and personal that focusing on the ""players"" so to speak i.e. the president and hero's"". The first film since ""vertigo"" in which the protagonist spends the entire film running from the danger. Cruise plays a part in this unlike hes previous roles. He is in fact an complete B*****d, a bad father and a natural coward, but the movies portrayal of his change in character to protect his children is far better than watching even the special effects which wow for all the right reasons - they loom in the background but are never the focus of the cameras attention. The brilliant use of sound (this is one that NEEDS to be seen in the cinema) is chilling at its worst. It gives the film the constantly oppressive feel it has.however i was surprised to see the film with such a low rating. 15 would have been far more appropriate. I'm not suggesting 12 year olds are too young to see it, but bringing in younger children would definitely be disturbing for them. i left the cinema at midnight mildly disturbed by some of the material the film brought up (read genocide, blatant murder for the need to survive, paedophilia and others which would be spoilers.This is definitely not a reason to miss out though.

I understand now why there has been such a mixed reaction to the film.In many respects, the film sticks closely to the original H.G. Wells' story (of which, I suspect, most people will have little intimate knowledge). An alien invasion at the beginning a new century, unstoppable devastating fighting machines (tripods), death rays, the ferry and basement scenes, the red weed, humans captured in a great metal basket under a fighting machine, the cause of the aliens' defeat - and of course the voiceovers at the film's start and end, straight out of the book.The film is impressive from a dramatic point of view - the earth's masses stripped of their technology by the electromagnetic pulses emitted by the strange lightning and quickly reduced to an unruly and desperate mob (very reminiscent of those in Dawn/Shaun Of The Dead), a sad mass of refugees stripped of any dignity and prepared to sink to any level to survive. ""The rout of civilisation, the massacre of mankind"". And of course Ray Ferrier's personal plight to survive and save his family.The battle scenes remind me, in concept, of those in Wells' book, where mere token attempts are made by mankind's military to repel the invaders, before control of the Earth is relinquished to the aliens. In the 1953 film, a nuclear weapon was used, but here there is no hint of nuclear munitions being employed. Spielberg seems torn between trying to adhere closely to the original story yet bring it into a modern context. Assuming that trying to do the former would not wash with today's audiences, then at least the fullest extent of today's technology should have been employed in what was clearly a do-or-die struggle. And while the crashed airliner scene is impressive (much better than the one from LOST!), if the aliens were really so militarily superior and human forces such a pushover then several detailed scenes of aliens destroying fleets of warplanes, massed ground forces or salvos of incoming missiles with their deathray would not have gone astray (as well as being easy to create), rather than the few skirmishes actually shown.These logical inconsistencies disturb me greatly:* Alien tripods have lain buried in the earth for millenia, just awaiting activation - wouldn't some have been discovered meanwhile? Modern mining regularly penetrates to a few km beneath the surface, though these machines seem have to been buried just under the surface. In the original Wells' story, alien cylinders are evidenced lifting off from Mars by Ogilvy the astronomer (not the basement oddball) from Mars' surface by the luminous green plumes they emit. Well it would be difficult to convince anyone today that such life exists _on_ Mars (though what about underneath?). But at least their origins then were not shrouded in mystery as in the present film.* Aliens ride down lightning beams into the tripods - ride down from where? The film seems anxious to avoid the idea that this is just another invasion from outer space (competition with ID4?), but it's either that or ""another dimension""* The basement scene is great drama but reminds me of Nazis hunting WWII escapees. The aliens apparently have no thermal imaging technology or don't realise that humans are warm-blooded* The aliens' sudden demise is as per the book. Like Polynesian cultures in the 19th century exposed to Europeans, their immune systems were simply unprepared for exposure to earthly organisms. But surely alien intelligences with such advanced technology would have sussed out any possible microbial threats and devised defences? Even our 20th century armies immunise their troops to try and avoid biological warfare casualtiesThis last point seems to have been the source of considerable contention (if not outright mirth) in audience/critic reaction.The week before War Of The Worlds was released globally, I happened to catch Minority Report on TV. The innovation and brilliance of that Spielberg effort whetted my expectation of what was to come - maybe this enhanced my negative reaction somewhat. WOTW is not a bad film by any means - 6/10 - and I will watch it again sometime. I only wish it had been the 9-10 I was hoping for.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The kids ruined the movie.,"Josh Friedman and David Koepp's family drama was already incredibly weak and cringe to begin with. Then further exacerbated by the horrendous acting by both Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin. The movie becomes grating at best in the drama department. How did Steven Spielberg agree to this script and approval of these two young actors? But then again, he has ruined plenty of movies. See Artificial Intelligence.The action and effects sequences are fantastic. The aliens and their annihilation of humans was well done and frankly, quite terrifying. The movie touching on man's downfall and it's inherent darkness was sobering and it rang true. No sugar coating here by Spielberg. It highlights that we are really no better than the aliens, especially if the situation was reversed. If anything, we would be worse. This was the movie's best and most intriguing motif.But for Pete's sake. The film is its own worst enemy. The only reason I didn't rate it 2 stars was because of Tom and Tim's acting and the good points above.As far as the action/sci-fi/adventure genre, this was the last spell by Steven that anybody cared about.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A disaster of Epic Porportions.,"In a summer season of grand blockbusters, ""War of the Worlds"" is perhaps the biggest dud in years, and is a failure of epic proportions. The film is a remake of the classic 1953 film of the same name which like the new one is inspired from the H.G. Wells novel of 1898.The new version is directed by Steven Spielberg, and stars Tom Cruise as Ray Ferrier, a divorced dockworker who is spending some time with his estranged children, Robbie (Justin Chatwin), and Rachael (Dakota Fanning), while his ex-wife and her new husband take a trip.The children are very cold to Ray as they feel they were dumped on their mother as Ray only cares about himself. When a series of freak electrical storms hits various cities around the world, Ray attempts to comfort his children who are disturbed by the storm as well as the fact that all electronic devices have ceased to function.Ray leaves the children at home and ventures into the neighborhood and is soon facing a waking nightmare as giant machines burst from the ground laying waste to everything in their paths.Ray gathers his family and flees in a working vehicle trying to stay one step ahead of the alien machines in an attempt to find safety and reunite the children with their mother in Boston.As basic as the above plot outline is, it is pretty much the entire plot of the film. There is little else to it aside from a few interruptions such as the family seeking shelter in a couple of houses or facing an angry mob as they attempt to reach a ferry.While a thin plot can be excused for many action films, what cannot be excused are the painfully bad lack of any excitement in the film and the lack of any compelling action or suspense.We are supposed to believe that the world is being destroyed by the alien's but aside from a few blasted bridges, and small buildings, we see a surprising lack of carnage. There are no sequences of classic landmarks being reduced to rubble, there are no scenes of vast armies locked in a desperate struggle against the invaders. Instead, we get a sequence of helicopters firing, and a line of soldiers firing, but they never show us what they are shooting at, nor do we see the alien retaliation behind a bright explosion and a few vehicles emerging on fire. This is particularly frustrating when you consider that the 1954 version at least showed a few tanks being blasted outright.Another issue I had with the film was the painfully obvious superimposed backdrops as during the films limited action scenes; the background was clearly inserted into the shot as it was so fuzzy that it did not fit in with the events in the foreground.While I am willing to dismiss this as stylistic nitpicking what cannot be ignored is that for most of the films running length, the cast does little more than stand around waiting for something to happen. There are no great segments of character development, no insight into why the aliens waited all this time to attack when they could have done so centuries earlier, why they want the planet, and numerous other plot holes, some of which are so glaring. One of my favorites was the guy who was able to use a video camera to record the opening attacks when it was clearly shown that all electronic devices were rendered useless.Much has been made of Cruise's recent off screen actions and I must say that those have been far more interesting and engaging than his performance here. Cruise spends the majority of the film in a wide-eyed gaze or frantically moving and yelling. His character like his annoyingly bratty daughter are so unsympathetic, I found myself hoping that the aliens would take them out and end our suffering.I hate stated prior that I thought this film may have problems as in light of films such as ""ID4"", the story would seem bland to modern audiences unless the action was increased and there was a dynamic story with interesting characters. Sadly all of those are missing from a film that also has one of the worst endings in recent history. There is no build up, no final confrontation, no moment of high tension to get to the payoff; it just ends with a whimper. One would think that a grand battle or an FX royale is in store instead, it plays out in a very matter of fact fashion with shockingly little action or suspense.I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that between the weak acting, tired, thin plot, and infrequent and underwhelming action and FX, this is a film that exists only due to the talents of Cruise and Spielberg., That being said, I have to wonder how and why they could not have picked a better product than this stale offering.1 stars out of 5 Gareth Von Kallenbach www.sknr.net International Association of Film Critics.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good special effects, weak script, good pacing .....","The pacing was fast, so I doubt anyone would get bored. The characterizations, however, were cardboard, and some of the characters seemed to have very little purpose in the film. Watch it for the special effects and action, but not for the people, nor the nuances that happen in the story, as that could be accomplished with a very simple sentence. I like Tom Cruise movies; he brings a certain presence so that there's no doubt who the characters revolve around. I rate this as one of his worst movies, but not because he didn't do a good job. This movie had the budget, the effects, excellent actors, but ultimately, they could've gotten a much better script.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Adrenaline Roller-coaster,"Why Spielberg took this project to do a remake of the excellent original 50s version is beyond me. So we get a loud Dolby THX soundtrack and state-of-the-art visual effects, but the action is basically the same. The alien invaders are only a cinematic diversion in order to see this family cope with primal fear, which we can genuinely feel. Okay, we focus more on Cruise and his absent parenting skills as he begins to re-bond with his children who are living with his divorced wife. Dakota Fanning steals the show. Again credit Cruise for willing to give up the spotlight for the rising starlette.The ending leaves you wondering, was it THAT easy??? And the old, so predictable Hollywood ending with Morgan Freeman's banal narrative explanation and ""moral to the story"".The impact of this story is so much more stronger from the 50s version with its period special effects and far more frightening to audiences in the 50s than a green-screened lets-blow-the-eardrums and give'm as much sensory overload for their ten bucks.

The best film version of War of the Worlds,"The 2005 version of War of the Worlds is the best on screen adaptation of the H. G. Wells novel (I haven't seen the Fox/Canal TV version.) This version of a ground view of an alien invasion as seen through the eyes of a struggling man. Tom Cruise goes against type by playing an ordinary Working Joe and a bad father as he gets caught up with the extraordinary events. Steven Spielberg knows how to make a popcorn film and his version of story does have excellent CGI effects and destruction. The film came across as a Spielbergian attempt of a horror film because there was panic and dread when the Tripods approach, social order breaks down, and characters have to hide from the aliens. It makes War of the Worlds more terrifying.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Save your money! No reason to see!,Now I know the reason for the wacky publicity. Truly terrible! Predictable sci-fi. The entire concept is a rehash of several other movies put all rolled into this joke. I am sure that Spielburg is embarrassed about how this dreadful piece turned out. I came out shaking my head in wonderment is this the same guy who did The color purple? Has Hollywood ran out of ideas. Maybe I do have a future as a screenwriter. I will admit this is the first review I have written for the sake of not really believing that my voice needs to be heard on a topic of whether a movies is good or not. This movie was a Joke. I would hope this will be the last time that a movie about aliens that has no originality what to speak of will ever be released.,7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Enjoyable...,"""War of the Worlds"" is an Adventure - Sci-Fi movie in which we watch a family trying to survive during an alien invasion. They have to deal with their new reality and what's going on while the aliens are threatening the existence and the evolution of humanity.I found this movie entertaining and interesting mainly because of the plot and the direction which was made by Steven Spielberg and it was simply amazing. Nice visual effects accompanied the movie through its whole duration something that made it even more interesting. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I have to mention Tom Cruise's who played as Ray Ferrier and Dakota Fanning's who played as Rachel Ferrier, and they were both very good.

Highly Entertaining Mix of Sci-Fi and Drama,"War of the Worlds (2005)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Intense adaptation of H.G. Wells' story has the Earth coming under attack from aliens that have placed spaceships under the grounds centuries before man were even on the planet. While all of this is going on, on father (Tom Crusie) who hasn't always been there for his kids must try and save their lives while also reaching them for the mistakes of his past.Steven Spielberg's WAR OF THE WORLDS comes so, so close to being one of the greatest science-fiction movies ever made. For the first 80 or so minutes the movie is downright flawless in the way it builds up tension and there's no question that the invasion scenes are some of the greatest ever created. I'd even argue that the family drama stuff actually works extremely well and especially one sequence that happens on a hillside between the father and his teenage son. Sadly, after this scene the movie loses some of its impact and ends in a pretty bad fashion. Still, Spielberg has still created a very good movie that fans of the genre should enjoy.Technically speaking the movie is quite flawless. I've never really been a fan of CGI unless it's done right and that's certainly the case here. There's a lot of destruction that happens throughout this movie from roads cracking to bridges tumbling over to bodies turning into dust and there are thousands of cars blown up and entire towns destroyed. The CGI spaceships look extremely good but best of all is that they're entirely believable. Another major plus is the wonderful cinematography that picks all of this up and the music score is also very impressive. Everything from the editing to the wonderful set design are top-notch as well.Another major plus are the performances with Cruise really shining in the lead role. In my opinion Cruise has never gotten the respect he deserves for the actor that he is and he proves that he can handle real drama and real emotion here. I thought the actor was extremely believable playing a blue collar worker who also happens to not be that good of a father. Cruise handles the action scenes flawlessly of course but the real highlight are the more dramatic moments including the before mentioned scene on the hill with his son. Dakota Fanning is also good in her supporting role of the daughter. Tim Robbins is also good in his brief part as a nut who gives the two shelter.But, speaking of that long sequence, I think it starts off good but the second portion of this sequence just loses some of the steam that the movie has built up. I'm obviously not going to spoil the ending but what happens at the very end just ruins what was built up earlier in the picture as well. I won't get into details but someone pops up at the end and just really ruins the ending. Still, WAR OF THE WORLDS has a lot going for it and it's certainly worth watching. It's an incredibly entertaining film but there's no question that with a few changes it could have been a masterpiece.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Second rate Spielberg,"Spielberg's loud and hectic adaptation of the classic sci-fi novel is watchable but ultimately disposable. Spielberg re-visits his earlier ideas of the benign alien and replaces them with murdering, colonising, reptilian creatures who want to use planet earth as some sort of blood farm. Cruise plays one of Spielberg's archetypal fathers - detached and uncomprehending of his children, but also a man who will do anything to protect them. His daughter, as portrayed by Dakota Fanning is as irritating a performance by a child as Hollywood has ever given us; precocious, annoying and with a line in self help and personal space she screams her way through the film - she can even scream over the marching noise of the tripods!Individual moments stand out amidst the cacophony Spielberg has flung on to the screen but this is certainly not the director at his best.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A possible explanation for the camcorder issue..,"Come on! WOTW is a fine movie, shot with excellent direction. I have never felt in action during a movie despite the fact that I felt threatened by aliens! Spielberg does his job with great respect and wisdom. Sorry 'artistic' people! But he is kind of a genius, always innovating something. I've watched -maybe- a thousand movies, but I go to the theater rarely due to financial constraints, yet Spielberg always makes me stretch my budget. This is why he makes a lot of money! As a fan of many kind movies including 'artistic' ones, I cannot see the reason for the hate against Spielberg. He absolutely loves and respects what he does and more importantly he cares about and respects the audience. Finding problems in a movie is very easy, I count them to double digit numbers for most of the movies.For the CAMCORDER issue; I should say it cannot be a mistake. I am not a very technical guy but all the things broken down by the lightnings have either connection to the local electrical network or have electrical engines( for example, a watch or a car-cars have small electrical engines to start) But camcorder does not have any of this.. I cannot believe such a stupid mistake exist in a so perfectly shot movie. Still, I can be mistaken..For the plot, I should acknowledge the weakness of the end, however it is very analogous to the ending of Wells' book. I have always liked the book and as a fan I found the script successful in the sense that it follows the book (secretly). If it were focusing a bunch of people as in Deep Impact, the result will be a betrayal to the book and will lead to another Independence Day.Cast was fine! Cruise is an intelligent guy, he knows in which movie to play or invest.Above all, what makes this movie very good is that it is excellently shot. From the first to last 10 minutes, audience, at least me, is absolutely thrilled by the reality of things in a science fiction movie. Everyone should admit that Spielberg is a very talented guy...I like Spielberg science-fictions..edit after couple of years: I cannot believe I called Cruise intelligent!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Family Feud Meets the Martians,"The movie War of the Worlds, (2005) is a case study of a dysfunctional family under fire. Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) plays a stevedore who returns home one day to greet his estranged wife, her new husband, his rebellious teenage son, a banshee-screaming daughter and invading Martians. Despite the explosive eruption, colossal growth, murderous rampage and vaporous populous, Ray reacts curiously as beings from Mars emerge to, destroy his city and systematically set out to conquer the world. Inhibiting clear thinking is his protective attitude, his chiding son who lambaste his father for personal failures, and his terrified daughter who's irritating screams prevent planning and implementation. The movie attempts to bring to life the classic novel by H. G. Wells and in many ways succeeds. However, Spielberg spent so much time on the bickering family, that he left the audience straining to see the cataclysmic confrontation between Earth's forces and the gigantic Tri-pod Martains, over the shoulders of Cruise and his problems. The original 1957 version had Gene Barry as a scientist and the audience easily followed him. In this version, Cruise is a common man who's innate curiosity becomes a hindrance. In addition, the great talent of Tim Robbins is wasted as a crazed survivor. In conclusion, the original had direction, the new version is hampered with family ties. Except for a few exceptional scenes, the film failed to live up to the original. ***",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mixed feelings about this one,"Steven Spielberg's new thriller, The War of the Worlds, is all together a very interesting movie. Steven does indeed deliver a high octane, fast paced, special effects extravaganza, but after the first hour or so the movie takes a more disturbing turn. The first hour of the movie was funny, scary, and very believable, even with the continuity mess-ups (like the video camera working when the aliens had blown out all electronic systems). Tom Cruise performs his role as a divorced father struggling for the love of his children very well, and you will be able to forgive him for the recent bad publicity. Even more amazing is the acting of young actress, Dakota Fanning, who despite her age possesses the traits of a well experienced actress. She succeeds in playing a small girl with certain psychological phobias such as intense claustrophobia.The first hour of War of the Worlds follows this format: The aliens land in a freak lightning storm, the humans are confused. The aliens activate their cumbersome tripod death walkers buried under millions of years of dirt, the humans are now very scared and extremely confused. The aliens begin to destroy the city and vaporize the humans, who, in turn, run around like a bunch of chickens with their heads cut off. The rest is a lot of running, dramatic screaming, and explosions, coupled with very good cinematography. This part of the movie will not disappoint the audience, and you might even get interested in where all this will go, which isn't anywhere very good.The Second half, however, fails to produce any real solution to the problem, which is hundreds (possibly thousands)of the alien tripods destroying life as we know it. The movie takes a very interesting, but highly unsuccessful turn, when Tom and his daughter run to seek safety in Tim Robbin's basement. Robbins ,at first, seems set on sitting and hiding, he says something to the effect of ""No one who runs will live."" Yet, later he seems to think the best method of solving the problem is to destroy the tripods, who have conveniently congregated over his home, from underneath, via tunnels or the subway system. Tim Robbins' character is actually quite disturbing and very well portrayed, but he might be the downfall of the movie. The movie continues to become more unbelievable when you discover the aliens are sucking the humans' blood and then covering the earth in red vein like systems with the blood in them. Tim Robbins then goes insane and the rest is history.The conclusion of the movie comes like a brick in the face, and nothing is really resolved, though some aliens are dead, their tripods destroyed. It fails to put the audience at ease. Yet somehow, throughout the tumult and chaos and continuity mistakes, the movie is redeemed by the first hour, which had been promising to develop in a completely different way. After you see this movie reflect on how the second half was an honest mistake that any one could have made, and it won't seem so bad, which it isn't.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Horrifyingly Grim,"Steven Spielberg has always made movies that have been well received by almost all. Personally, I love all his movies to date. But this one was different.I had been anticipating the release of this movie ever since I had seen the teaser almost a year before. It was tops on my 'must-see' list of summer movies. However, the product I saw on screen was less then appealing.Right from the start, I could tell something was not right. The film seemed incredibly dark, not a blue sky to be seen, and very little sunshine. The script is nothing special, and you can tell that you're in for 2 hours of clichéd dialogue. That's fine, I don't mind it. However, as soon as the invasion begins, the film embodies the feeling only experienced by watching a mass execution. And that is basically what this film is, the complete extermination of the human race.The way the humans are killed is disgusting, the state the minds of the people in the film are in is disturbing, the amount of blood is enough to make you sick. The mood was so grim, so intense I was forced to leave halfway through to escape it. I went back, just to say I saw it through to the end.War of the Worlds was not a fantastic film. It sure wasn't the best Spielberg movie, and it was just another lackluster Tom Cruise performance. Except this wasn't a movie that you expect to feel good after. Spielberg realised this and threw in an ending he thought would at least make you happy. Sorry Steven, just to little to late.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"As usual, the original movie rules, the remake is totally lame","Two words: Lameous Maximus. While the invading aliens have developed technology capable of destroying earth and disabling nearly all of mans technology, the complex inner-workings of the common camcorder elude even the most brilliant alien scientists.Why should the aliens use their latest greatest alien technology to attack earth when they can bury million year old technology in the earth and dig it up when they get to our planet. This is sort of like the US air force leaving their F-16's and stealth fighters at home when they fight abroad so they can dig up some old biplanes that have been buried for one hundred years.Insignificant Technical Note: Man didn't inhabit the earth a million years ago when they buried the machines. But, maybe the aliens didn't want to attack the crocodiles and alligators so they decided to wait?Oh NO here come the aliens they are destroying the city. I can: 1. Leave the city and hide in the country? Nope too obvious. 2. Go underground and hide in the city? Nope the subways can be dangerous. 3. Board a large well lighted ship that is loaded with people and surrounded by alien tripods of death. YES!Oh NO here come the aliens they are destroying the army. However, I know that even though our latest missile technology bounces off their tripods like BB's, I can destroy the aliens and their indestructible tripods of death with nothing but my bare hands.Now, the best part of the movie, when the kid refuses to listen to Tom Cruise and charges into the oncoming tripods of death, a cheer comes from the audience and cry of: Death to the IDIOT!

Bore of the Worlds,"Mister Teeth Tom Cruise plays a divorced father of a precocious daughter Dakota Fanning and angry teenage son Robbie. His ex-wife drops the kids off for the weekend. Before you can say ""What's for dinner?"" the aliens arrive. After that it's pretty much Cruise and the kids running from the swath of death and destruction wrought by the aliens.There is nothing wrong with the performances of Cruise and Fanning. Before the aliens invade, Fanning is cute and Cruise is a guy you'd have a beer with after work and talk about baseball. But when the aliens arrive the screenwriters give Fanning a lot of crying, whimpering and screaming and Cruise is relegated to a papa bear trying to save his cubs. The problem is not with the actors but with the script. Their characters aren't allowed to develop since they spend all their time running, hiding, and trying to stay alive.Tim Robbins plays Ogilvy a rather lunatic guy hiding in the cellar of a farmhouse. He does an adequate job with the little part he is given. He is totally unnecessary to the film and in fact make the film grind to a halt.The aliens are nothing new and we've seen the likes of them in Independence Day and Signs.It's fair to compare this movie to other Spielberg films. WOTW is about the same quality as Minority Report and A.I. It is not in the same league as Close Encounters, ET, Jaws or Raiders of the Lost Ark. It really lacks any Spielberg touches and could just as well have been directed by someone else.The FX are mostly spectacular but sometimes cheesy. Some scenes look absolutely real, as if they were filmed with a documentary camera. Others look like flat blue screen. Roger Ebert liked the scene with the flaming train and this could have been special but it's lost with the larger FX. The scene in the farmhouse cellar has been compared to the raptors-in-the-kitchen scene in Jurassic Park and had a similar tension.There are huge plot holes and unfortunately you notice them during the movie, not later as you talk about it over dinner. There's no reason to rehash them because they've been documented in other reviews. But you wouldn't expect them in a movie of this nature and they are annoying.This is simply a remake. The 1953 original had its charm even when you could see the wires holding up the alien ships.

"Flawed, but some of the finest examples of cinema entertainment","After the first arrival of the tripods, and for about 30 mins after, Spielberg gives us some of the scariest stuff I can remember in ages.On the whole I hate the use of GCI in film, but on the whole it is well used sparingly in this film. The tripods were scary as s***.Flawed, in my opinion because of the appearance of the aliens that was not necessary and showed the weakness of GCI, the Abyss type tripod eye did not scare me, and the ending was disappointing.Overall, a return to form for Spielburg who invented the Summer blockbuster.(I went in with low expectations after some of the comments here, particular in reference to continuity errors that I looked for and it turned out were not there.

Spielberg did a good job, like Orson Welles radio production, it was also cool how he put the setting somewhere where the audience (Americans) would notice where it is all happening. In the movie I disliked a lot more than what I did like though. The movie just didn't excite me and that's maybe because I'm more of an action movie kind of guy. In the movie the little girl was just way to over reacting, and over dramatic she kept screaming when it just wasn't necessary. It became annoying and made me not want to watch the movie. I didn't like how many of the characters were very careless at times like; the father didn't care about anything at all and just forgets about things. His ex-wife was just weird looking and just too much of a needy person to her kids. The flat characters of the movie just seemed to be stupid. They stood there instead of running and getting away. I mean if anything enters our world and you don't know what it is I would run pack and get out of the city. It's just all common sense. It made the characters in the movie seem really senseless. I also didn't like how the aliens could just destroy things like we were bugs and we couldn't do anything to damage them. So in conclusion the movie was OK. I'll give a rating of 6 out of 10. It kept me interested, but there was thing's that really didn't catch my attention to keep me glued to the TV.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Everyone is not to forget this is a film not a scientific experiment,"I have just watched this film and found every bit of it excellent, i am sick of people saying oh he didn't do enough research on these aliens or not enough on this an whats this story line that wasn't in the original....... so what who cares, its a film thats really enjoyable to watch and maybe it is a little too far-fetched but aren't most films today like i'robot for example.This film was excellent an there was only one mistake that annoyed me which was where the tripod machine came out of the ground and that man was using the digital cam-corder???? wasn't there supposed to have bin a Electrical Magnetic Pulse which cut out all electrical things within a certain distance so why was the camera working.Yes... there are a few mistakes in this film but not enough to re-make the whole film as i would quite happily go out and buy this film for myself as it is a greatly enjoyable film for all and its full of suspense action.I don't know what is up with some people but a film is just a film not a huge scientific project lets not forget that sane people",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I'll over simplify,If they would have just killed off the annoying Mother and the 2 kids the Movie would likely be a perfect 10. All 3 were far worse than invading Aliens.,7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Stupidity At Its Worst,"It was really disappointing. It's overtly dramatic and tries to play on sympathies that they just don't set up. I find it very hard to believe that any intelligent critic truly liked this film. Character driven? That is the most overused term, thrown around by those who don't know any better. If a character strings together more then four coherent lines people love to label the movie as ""Character driven."" The fact is, the characters aren't developed during this film. Sure, they are scared but the movie is presented in such a over-the-top fashion that you just want to cringe.The film's storytelling stumbles frequently. I'd rather have bamboo shoots jammed under my fingernails then be forced to have to watch that movie again.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Will Spielberg ever truly reach the dark side?,"There is a simple reason why Steven Spielberg is so popular among many. He has an ability to place you in the moment that few other contemporary directors have. Even his worst films have their redeeming qualities - qualities that generally stay with you, and make those films worth a glance. He is undeniably sentimental and manipulative, but he is one of the best - if not THE best - at being so. His best films have made drama genuinely moving, rather than nauseating, and most of the suspenseful set pieces he has created have been inspired and stood the test of time, even if they have (unfortunately) driven on endless imitators.With War Of The Worlds, Spielberg has attempted a bleak vision of the future for the third time. In his previous two attempts - AI and Minority Report - he came agonisingly close to the dark side (in my view, he has never come closer than Schindler's List, and even then he stumbled a tiny bit), but overly sentimental and not-entirely-logical endings severely damaged both efforts. However, they were still enough positives about Minority Report to earn it more widespread critical acclaim and a strong recommendation from me (which still stands today).War Of The Worlds looked promising. The central crew of all his films from Schindler's List onwards was still in place. Realising just how successful his last collaboration with Tom Cruise was, he recalled him to play the lead role. Respected actors such as Miranda Otto (recently made more famous thanks to The Lord Of The Rings trilogy), Tim Robbins and gifted child actor Dakota Fanning were also cast.A modern-day remake of the classic H.G. Wells story, War Of The Worlds' protagonist is dock worker Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise). His family life is in pieces - neither his son Robbie (Justin Chatwin) nor daughter Rachel (Dakota Fanning) fully appreciate him. So when his ex-wife Mary Ann (Miranda Otto) leaves the kids around for a weekend visit, it looks like another case of awkward bonding. Then a bizarre storm starts brewing...And at last, we think, the dark side will not elude Spielberg. The aliens are coming, and their goal is, in one word, extermination. And so we watch as the human race fights to survive against the aliens in the tripods.All of the action scenes hold your attention, and some are truly breathtaking. One of these is a suspense scene that's reminiscent of the spy-der search from Minority Report. I might even argue that it tops that particular scene. There's holocaust-style imagery that leaves an incredible impact. Once again, Spielberg manages to draw a reasonable performance from Tom Cruise (although he was acting a little too smarmy for my liking in the early stages of the film). And, as always, Spielberg shows his indefatigable gift for getting the most from child actors. Dakota Fanning proves to be the perfect choice for Spielberg's latest wide-eyed protagonist. Refreshingly, her character is not such a cheap ploy for sympathy.But hang on...didn't I mention earlier on that Spielberg doesn't seem to know how to end these kind of films? I won't spoil the ending for you, but I can say that while it's not as damaging as AI's ending was, it is still poorly executed. The ending's not the only cop-out; I seem to recall an action scene that was all-too-conveniently resolved. I can also recall a couple of references to ET. Nice touches though they are, we're not really looking for ""nice"" in War Of The Worlds, are we? And somehow, I think we could have done without Morgan Freeman's voice-overs, Steve.Worst of all, when we look at the picture as a whole, we suddenly see that War Of The Worlds doesn't really add up to much. It's brilliantly executed, to be sure, but the best science fiction has always dealt more with ideas as well as action. For the sake of crafting a modern blockbuster, Spielberg tends to have set almost all meaning aside at the expense of action scenes and only marginally successful character bonding moments. (Then again, maybe this is more the fault of the screenwriters...) When you see what Spielberg is capable of as a director you find yourself expecting more than what he delivers here.In a nutshell, War Of The Worlds is another missed opportunity in the Spielberg catalogue. It's undoubtedly worth watching, and it fits the bill as a summer movie, but like Minority Report before it, its lack of focus has prevented it from realising its true potential.Rating: 6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The kids characters are horrible brats.,"Love sci-fi, love Tom Cruise. Hated the characters of the kids. If you are on the fence about whether to have kids or not. This movie could promote birth control. Especially the teenage son.Otherwise it's a pretty good movie. I've watched it a number of times. I hate the kids every time. Little Dakota does a good job.

I want my two hours back!,"Garbage, utter garbage. Not only does Cruise sleepwalk through this film, but the the other two children aren't any better. Tim Robbins is in the wrong film. Other than VERY good special effects, it's pointless, just watch the original instead.There is no connection between the audience and the characters in this film. Not only DON'T I care if they survive, I'm actually rooting for the Martians for most of the film. Why do I care if an egomaniacal Cruise makes it to his ex-wife's house in Boston? And so conveniently they're all fine and dandy, when 90% of everyone else in the move gets killed. Unbelievable! Don't bother.I want my two hours back!",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Despite a few really terrifying moments of cinema, this is a really bad movie.","Despite a few really terrifying moments of cinema, this is a really bad movie. Why can't anyone do H. G. Wells right? Well, in the original 1950's movie ""War of the Worlds"" George Pal tried, but even they cut corners (they used ""rays"" instead of tripod legs for the Martian machines.) The best of H. G. Wells to cinema is still ""The Invisible Man"", ""First Men on the Moon"" and ""Things to Come"".Now to dissect Steven Spielberg's nightmare of what I consider to be the worst modern SCIFI movie ever made. Steven, listen to me, you can't expect a movie to be about toasting humans elegantly as if somehow to evoke the emotions of the holocaust, then have a ten year old little cute white blond girl watch in big blue eyed scream in horror sans Dakota Fanning, and constantly put her in jeopardy: To the cheap reaction of the audience and expect that to be cinema.And you can't use Tom Cruise's mugging or tired toothy grin to pull you out of a bad script. And please, Steven, don't pull another typical Father and Son conflict out of your old magic hat to evoke drama. That crap just does not work anymore. It is hard to believe that the same man that directed ""Jaws"", ""E.T. The Extraterrestrial"", and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" put together, let alone signed his name to such tripe.Finally and most shamelessly, Steven, you have evoked the paranoia of a real event, that of 9/11 in your film with constant reference to ""are they terrorists?"" And then to use the jingoistic display of the American flag? That is just pathetic, and Steven, you should be ashamed for exploiting these images for your profit and gain. Shame on YOU!Finally, Steven, where the heck was the plot? No where to be found. Big bad alien machines crusted up from under the streets and toasting everybody and expecting Tom Cruise's horror at the crust on his face eliciting some sort of compassion? Fantastic movie imagery was all you were after but even those images were few and far between. But who were these machines? Where did they come from? What was their agenda? How did they die? Intelligence is sorely lacking in this film. Sad in a way because Steven, you quote H. G. Wells' novel in the opening stanza. Again . . . shame on YOU!The original Victorian story of ""The War of the Worlds"" was one of genuine and unique paranoia for the times. This novel (you must read it - classic stuff) has has yet to be done on film properly. In order to do the film correctly, the movie has to embody the time. It is entirely plausible during the turn of the 20th century that Mars might be a harbinger of intelligent life, given the canals of Lovell, and that Martian war machines could compete with that era's military might - but today it just does not seem credible. Oh well. I am so tired of bad movies.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spielberg's Thrilling and Haunting Take on a Classic Invasion Story,"Steven Spielberg's War of the Worlds is a relentless and intense reimagining of the classic alien invasion story. From the very beginning, the film plunges viewers into the chaos, following Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) as he fights to protect his children amidst the brutal destruction unfolding around them. Spielberg captures the terrifying powerlessness of humanity against a technologically advanced alien force, with scenes that are both visually stunning and terrifyingly immersive.The film's strength lies in its ability to balance action with deeply personal stakes. Cruise's performance as a flawed, desperate father gives the story emotional weight, making every close call feel that much more intense. Dakota Fanning also shines as his young daughter, bringing a sense of vulnerability that keeps viewers invested in their survival.The special effects are incredible, bringing the towering alien tripods and their deadly heat rays to life with frightening realism. John Williams' haunting score adds to the film's eerie atmosphere, enhancing each moment of suspense and dread. War of the Worlds doesn't just tell an alien invasion story; it delivers a visceral experience that puts you right in the middle of the chaos.While it may deviate from the original story, Spielberg's War of the Worlds stands as a thrilling, modern sci-fi classic that delivers on both spectacle and emotion.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
pretty good,"this movie was another movie that was really hyped up to be good. It looked good in the previews and it was good. Ray (Tom Cruise) played his part very well and so did his daughter in the movie. Though there were a couple of things that made NO SENSE. 1. When the power outage occurred and the cars, cellphones, radios, TV's, anything with a battery or electronic related didn't work. WHY THE **** DID A VIDEO CAMERA WORK WHEN THE FIRST ALIEN SHIP APPEARED? 2. When that punk-*** cry-baby kid was like ,""dad let me go"" (which he did go) And he fought with the army during that huge explosion. How the **** did he survive that. And why did he all of a sudden like his dad at the end? Except for those minor defaults the movie turned out the be pretty good, pretty good plot, but a bad ending.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This film is spoiled...,"This film is completely ruined by the presence of the ""standard kids"" that seems to infiltrate films like this all the time. The rebelling ""hard ass"" kid who hates his father and the screaming, irritating beyond reason little brat. I was just hoping and praying that these two god awful characters would be killed off - but then reality set in and realised they are never killed off. Why is it so difficult for Hollywood to make a good film WITHOUT feeling the need to put such awful characters in?",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Beyond the First 30 Minutes This Is A Dud,"Well I was kind of hoping for a movie set in the same period, the Victorian Era, as the book but Steven Spielberg decided to go for the modern day era. It makes sense to a degree and he does manage to pull it off. Normally I find Tom Cruise somewhat annoying but he was tolerable in this in his role as an irresponsible, divorced father. The first 30 minutes are quite a treat and the alien tripods are truly frightening as looming machines of death. The aliens on the other hand are too cutesy looking and didn't come off as the jealous and spiteful tentacled masses that H.G. Wells originally envisioned. There are some serious plot holes like where the tripods originated from as well as other finer details. The movie starts to sag around the middle and the end comes abruptly. Still, this is a decent summer action flick for a night at the drive-ins or at home in your living room.As a side note, check out Jeff Wayne's musical adaption of ""The War of the Worlds"" to see cooler styled tripods and hear a memorable interpretation of the original book.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
close encounter of the dumb kind,"Just rented the DVD (thank God I didn't see it in a theatre) and was surprised how brutally awful it was. On the awful scale it was even worse then ""Temple of Doom"" and ""The Terminal"", Spielberg's previous low points. It's hard to say when and where he lost his ""chops"", but old Stevie boy doesn't even try anymore. The first 25 minutes of the movie were really amazing and my wife and I were giving each other high fives over the special effects. From the point they got into the only car working and decide to drive it to Boston, you could just remove your brain for the next hour and a half. Nothing makes any sense. Every encounter they have with other people, or aliens for that matter, is just goofy and inane. In ""Jaws"", Spielberg had some top notch actors (Roy Schneider, Richard Dreyfus and especially the great Robert Shaw) in a blockbuster where they portray actual living, breathing characters. In this ""blockbuster"", he has capable actors (Cruise, Fanning,Miranda Otto) and dumb-ass dialogue. I felt sorry for the actors. Their director was missing in action and their performances showed it. Hey Steven, step aside and let a hungry director take on your next project. It won't hurt you to miss a few meals, so to speak. I'm waiting for the day when I'm happily standing in line again and smiling from ear to ear after watching one of your movies.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An accurate story off a survivor,This is not a gun ho movie but very thoughtful and realistic. Think of it as a tragedy and what you would try to do with your family to keep them safe from something you had no power over. If you are a parent (I am not but I can imagine) what would you do to keep your family safe?There are many things that make this movie great.1. Lighting and effects - make you believe you are in the true action of the horror.2. Sense of Survival - God bless them but think of yourself as a Jew in the Holocaust. What is happening is out of your control and you do whatever it is you need to do to survive.3. A movie for family learning - I would not say this is a family movie (for young children) but it does show the importance and quality of family togetherness during a tragedy.,9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
