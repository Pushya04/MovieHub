A testament to no-budget film-making,"This film has maybe been one of the most hated 100 million dollar grosses in history.  Before seeing this movie one should know absolutely nothing about it.  Not even what the critics have said.  It is a very creepy film.  I for one loved it.  I love the fact that it had virtually no-budget and it has made tons of money.  It deserves it.  It provides more atmosphere and creepiness than any horror film released this decade.  The way it is presented, as the footage taken by 3 missing film-makers, is so simple yet pure genius.  I've heard people complain that anyone with a video camera could have made this.  This is true, but those people didn't and these people did.  They had the idea and those who criticize it are just displaying their jealousy that they didn't think of it first.  An instant classic whether you like it or not.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Generation Xers head into woods; we view excellent results,"I saw this film last night, LONG after all the hype and reviews were made about it. I settled in with the right mood for any film: no expectations. If you expect too much, you may be let down (take note for any Kubrick film). I watched the entire film without interruption and came out with a great feeling. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is one darn good movie.Many critics and moviegoers complained about the film for its length, its amateurish photography/editing, and its lack of adequate acting. I feel these things MADE THE MOVIE. First, the film has to be at most ninety minutes long: any more, and it would be too long and boring. Second, the amateur video take gives the audience the feel that they are actually in the woods, listening to the rippling water of the creek, snapping branches under their boots, and hearing things go bump in the night. I greatly admire the use of two video cameras (one black-and-white, the other color) to denote which character is shooting the film. Lastly, the incessant screaming of whiny Heather, the constant complaining of average-joe Mike, and the Dudley-Do-Rightness of Josh make for great acting. Yes, these are regular people and up-and-coming actors from your local community theater, but YOU KNOW THEM. You've met people like them.The biggest complaint, however, comes from the film's supposed ""lack"" of scary moments. This film reminds me of the classic horror film ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre,"" and though not as gory and as shocking as that film, ""The Blair Witch Project"" shows just enough fright in the group's search for a way out of the woods, stalked by people and/or things they may never understand. In the older film, the long interval between opening credits and first gory act of violence is about thirty minutes long; it is even longer here, but the suspense/fright (just as in the older film) begins right from the opening credits: you just don't see it until the film's over. These are three people out to make a documentary in the woods with handheld camcorders--these are REAL PEOPLE. And GREAT ACTORS. Heather whines a lot and screams and reminds you of the girl you hate so much you fall in love with her. Her screams sound real, her cries are genuine, and she is DEEPLY DEEPLY sorry for bringing the others into the woods in order to film her documentary.I really dig the beginning. It seems so real to me I may delve into my old home movies for nostalgia. Heather and Josh pick up Mike, then go to the store for supplies. This opening sequence really packs a punch. These are three Generation Xers out for a camping trip. We all know what happens to them, but we're glued to the screen, intent to know what actually happens.The interviews give us some detail into the Blair Witch legend, but most of the audience is too busy thinking about the actual trek into the woods that they don't listen. This is wrong. Listening is good. The interviews, which also sound real and not rehearsed in any way, are like movie reviews: the critics tell you what they saw, but mostly they don't want to ruin it for you...unless they hated it.And that's what I'll do. I won't ruin it for you. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Tense, unsettling, original, intelligent, short, cheap.","This film is not a feature film.  For a start, it is not feature length, also, it is not shot on film.  More importantly, it does not have what feature films have these days: star actors, special effects, exotic locations, explosions.  Instead, seeing B.W.P. is seeing something else that a cinema can be: a place where people can share an intimate experience created by a few people on a tight budget.  I would be glad of its success if only for that reason.The first section of the film appears at first to be amateurish and slow. In fact, it is very deft, and very efficient at what it does.  It tells the audience everything it needs to know about the characters and situation, and nothing more.  Also, it gets the audience into the habit of viewing the film's format: alternating between black and white (very grainy and poorly focussed) film, and the washed out colours of shaky pixilated video.  The film makers managed to set up a rationale for why the film is so cheaply made.  Three people hike into the woods for a few days to shoot a documentary, with borrowed equipment, and are in the habit of videoing everything for the hell of it.   They cannot carry tripods, steadicams, dollies, large lighting rigs, or the like, so everything we see is lit either by raw daylight, or by a single light fixed to the camera, which illuminates just what is within a few feet of the lens.  The film creates its own excuse to be cheap.  This is intelligent.The acting and script are both excellent.  The well-cast actors are presumably playing pretty-much themselves, and are convincingly naturalistic, and neither too likeable or too dislikeable.  The slow route into hysteria is well documented.  Rather than simply having a character say ""We're lost!"", we see many scenes which show the trio getting more and more hopelessly lost, and more annoyed with each other for this.  By the time they are thoroughly lost, the audience shares the despair.My friend and I, after seeing it, both felt a little sick.  I put this down to my having been tense for a hour, he put it down more to motion sickness. The jerky, badly-framed camerawork is hard on the eye and stomach, but I applaud the director for its uncompromising use.  Similarly, no compromise is made with the dialogue.  Some of it is very quiet and must be listened for, some is technical jargon, which is left realisticly unexplained.One of the great strengths and weaknesses of the film is the editing.  It is good in that it does much to heighten the tension, with many key moments lasting just a little too long for comfort.  Each time the characters find something nasty, the viewer is made to want the editor to cut soon to the next scene, and the fact that he doesn't adds to the sense of being trapped, as the characters are.  The problem with this, though, is that one is left wondering about the motives of the fictional editor.  In truth, of course, the film is edited to create these effects, and to entertain, but the film's rationale is that these are the rushes of a documentary put together posthumously by someone other than the film's original creator.  Why, then, would an editor piecing together such footage, edit for dramatic effect rather than for clarity?  Why would he keep cutting back and forth from the video footage to the film footage, when neither shows any more information than the other?The film is stark.  After one simple caption at the start, all that follows is the ""rushes"".  I wonder if the film might not have been improved with an introductory section which documented how the rushes were found and edited. A programme was made for television which did this.  Perhaps a portion of this might have been added to the film, making it more complete, and more believable (and proper feature length).While I applaud the fact that young original film-makers have managed to create a mainstream hit out of a simple idea, well-handled.  I dread the possible avalanche of inferior copies which may come.Most horror films these days are created not for the audience, but for the makers.  The departments of special effects, make-up, model-making, animation and so forth all try hard to show potential future employers what they can do.  The result is that nothing is left for the audience to do, since everything can be seen and heard, and the viewer's imagination can be switched off.  Today, it is possible to see pigs fly on the screen, and so film-makers show off and show us a formation of Tamworths, which is something which will look impressive in the trailer.  To show us less is to make our minds fill in the gaps.  This way, we create our own terrors, perfectly fitted to ourselves.  The ghastly face I see in my head, is the ghastly head which I find scary.  The ghastly face I am shown may be one I can cope with quite easily.  If I see a believable character screaming in hysterical fear at something I cannot see, my own brain creates demons for my night's dreams, demons far more mighty than anything CGI graphics or a latex mask could portray.This film will stay in your thoughts for some while.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Original masterpiece,"This kept me a nervous wreck throughout. Considering the reviews I've seen, looks like you'll either love it or hate it. I personally love it, and think it's better than a lot of films I've seen with an all star cast, and a much higher budget.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Much better than its reputation,"It seems many people dislike this film because they think the entirety of its reputation lay in the confusion/publicity campaign generated at the time of its release as to whether it was a real film found in the woods of Maryland that documented the disappearance of three college students or whether it was just a movie. What made this film scary in 1999 and scary now is what you don't see and what you think you hear as well as the growing paranoia and fright of the college kids lost in the woods over a period of days that find - as they run out of food and supplies - that they are just wandering in circles.The very last scene is particularly chilling, and if you already know how it ends it will kill some of the fright factor for you. However, this film just proved in 1999, as it still does, that you don't have to fill a horror film with wall-to-wall state-of-the-art CGI visual effects and shocking violence in order to be scary. I personally think the horror genre has been much worse off since Jason and his ilk first invaded the movies back in 1980 with graphic violence that is predictable and, quite frankly, boring. Although I like this movie, the sequel, ""Book of Shadows"", is just awful. Its makers Hollywoodized the original concept and thus made it completely incoherent and unwatchable. Avoid it at all costs.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Waste of time..,"I spent about an hour and a half sitting around in my living room on halloween waiting for something...anything to happen.  Just when I thought it was coming to the big climax at the end in the house, nothing happens....big surprise.This movie is a complete waste of time..there is nothing scary about it unless you find filming shots of the woods, watching swearing teens, listening to a high pitched annoying girl voice (that was pretty scary), watching film from inside a tent with cheap sound effects playing outside, or watching a wobbly camera run through the woods at night (cant see anything), then you should skip this movie.  If I was out in the middle of the woods, I too would decide to throw away my only way of finding my way around..my map. This movie had a weak, if any plot.  This movie was one of the biggest let downs I have ever seen, and I've seen ""Batman and Robin.""I've never seen BWP 2, but it's anything like this movie, it will be equally bad if not worse, because I would have to waste another 90 minutes of my life.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Sorry we couldn't supply the eye candy most of you are so used to.....,"I think I know why Blair Witch has generated as much negative as positive responses.  It FORCES YOU TO BECOME INVOLVED IN THE MOVIE GOING EXPERIENCE!Wow.  What a concept.  Instead of sitting there like the passive sponges most of us become when going to the movies we are actually expected be become involved.  Take a leap of faith/belief or whatever and delve into this movie.  Without the overpowering F/X and music score most movies rely on to 'scare' you, if you still have an imagination left what is implied becomes a hundred times scarier than anything offered up by Hollywood in the last 30 years.  The hardest thing in movies is to scare you.  Not make you jump out of your seat with 5000 watts of sound blasting at 400 decibels (ever seen the 1999 version of the Haunting?  Event Horizon? - every potentially tense scene is preceeded by dead silence then the Blast).  Wake up people!

That was it?,"One time as I entered a theater the usher was handing out 3D glasses for a short demonstration before the main film. After the previews finished and we were instructed to put the glasses on, there was a brief shot of a virtual theater in 3D, then it ended! Several members of the audience, including me, said in unison, ""That was it?""That more or less describes my feelings about ""The Blair Witch Project."" When it first came out in the summer of '99, a fellow told me that it was the scariest film he'd ever seen. That's what many critics had indicated as well. Since I love being scared, I eagerly went to the theater, thinking I was in for the experience of a lifetime.The movie tells the story of three college kids who do a research assignment, go on a long camping trip into the woods, and ultimately lose their way. As I watched the kids grow increasingly panicky and finally get separated, my interest began to perk...and then the movie just ended! I sat there in confusion. That was it? Where was the fear that everyone spoke about?My complaint is not that the film lacked violence. On the contrary, I'm genuinely tired of the sort of horror film where explicit gore substitutes for true terror. I believe that the most effective horror movies leave a lot to the imagination. Shortly after seeing ""The Blair Witch Project,"" I saw ""The Sixth Sense,"" which scared the pants off me without containing much explicit violence. A movie does not need violence in order to be scary, and, indeed, too much violence can detract from a movie's suspense. But one thing a good horror movie absolutely must do is establish a real threat, something that ""The Blair Witch Project"" does not do.In the early scenes, I was unable to make sense out of the local legends the kids were investigating. The stories that the residents tell are unconvincing and contradictory. One resident talks about seeing a ""white misty thing,"" another describes what he saw as ""an old woman whose feet never touched the ground."" This is the kind of naiveté associated with popular folklore like the Loch Ness Monster, and I could not connect any of it with the movie's later events.While we are told that the kids were never found, the footage presents no clear-cut evidence that anything actually happens in the woods, other than that the kids get lost. In one scene, Heather begins screaming frantically at something she finds in a pile of leaves. I later found out that she was supposed to have seen severed human parts, but that was far from clear to me. Fans somehow piece together the various sections of the film and concoct a coherent story of supernatural murder, but to me it looked more like a case of hysteria than an encounter with a Blair Witch.Despite my criticisms, this isn't a bad film. As a fake documentary, it is well-made. The kids look, talk, and act like real college students. While not scary, the film is far from boring. I enjoyed watching the story progress while giving the appearance of being something spontaneous.Curiously, the Razzie awards nominated both this film and Heather Donahue's performance as the worst of 1999, one of the few times I've disagreed with their selections. We tend to overlook how hard it is for actors to act like they're not acting. People who argue that Donahue's performance was over-the-top have never, I suspect, seen someone panic. There was not a moment in the film that felt wrong or fake to me. Perhaps the reason I didn't get scared is that I felt smarter than these characters, who behave in ways that I do not think I would have behaved in the same situation. But I still found their reactions plausible.If I was disappointed, it was only because the hype surrounding this film gave me a certain set of expectations, which failed to solidify. This movie was an early demonstration of the power of the Internet, a cheap $20,000 production that never would have attained so much popularity if not for a website that helped propagate the legend to the public as something real. It was more than just a film: it was an act of showmanship. This all amounted to an interesting demonstration, but not the sort of film I expect will endure.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The witch has no clothes.,"This one is like the fable about the Emperor and his new clothes. He didn't have any, and the Blair Witch doesn't have any. This thing was awful, I wanted to like it, I expected to like it, I tried to like it, I came away hating it. I saw this thing three times, and while it's got a great idea, and it's not terrible for a student film say, it's far far too long and boring for the one trick it's got to pull, I simply am at a loss as to how so many people can allegedly have loved this thing.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Haven't you ever been to camp?,"This movie scared me in a way that no other has done before.  I remember going to camp as a child, and hearing things outside at night.  That was scary enough.  This movie recreated that entire scenario and then added some to it.  The fact that those things that go bump in the night outside your campsite were REAL in this movie makes it more nerve-inducing and frightening.  As anyone, the first time I set foot in the ocean after seeing JAWS for the first time, I was nervous.  Let me tell you in order to get from the movie theater to my house, I have to drive through the woods. After seeing this movie, that drive got SIGNIFICANTLY longer, more eerie, and scared the heck out of me.  I went about 90 mph all the way home in order to get out of the woods!  This is one SCARY movie.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Birth of a sub-genre,"In October 1994, three film students Heather Donahue, Josh Leonard and Mike Williams (their real names) disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland. A year later, their cameras are found. There is a local legend of The Blair Witch and missing children. They were there to do a documentary.This is the granddaddy of the found footage movies. This could be scary if the audience buys into the film as real. I didn't and it's not scary for me. It's a little too shaky and rambling. I am reminded of Michael Moore talking about what a revelation the tripod is. Also the start is excruciatingly slow. It's an interesting idea that birthed a whole new genre. That's no easy task. However, it achieves very little more than that for me. It is more dizzying than frightening.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Boring, slow and not scary in the slightest","If you are looking for something to scare you, look somewhere else, this is the worst excuse I have seen for a horror film.

An Experiment In Fear,"Hmm. Wow. What is there left to say? I've waited for most of the hype to die down to even add my comments for this movie to IMDB, and here they are:This is really a movie that has polarized a lot of people. Many love it and consider it the best thing since sliced bread, and plenty more absolutely hate it and call it tripe, drivel, awful, wretched, the worst ever, etc. (NOTE: as far as I'm concerned, the opinions of anyone calling any movie the best- or even more especially, the worst- movie ever are to be immediately disregarded.) Highly innovative in its way, it spawned many parodies and an interesting but inferior sort-of sequel. In the summer of Star Wars: Episode 1, this was the movie that originated several cultural symbols.I saw this movie shortly after it opened in wide release. Sitting in a theater surrounded by my friends with popcorn in my lap and watching Mike and Heather run around some creepy old house, I felt for the first and last time in my adult life *real, creeping fear* when I myself was not in danger.Many have complained about the shaky-cam, the cussing, how nothing 'really happens', and that it's not scary. By and large, the camera is not *that* shaky, at least to the point where you can't understand why- they're tromping through the woods and they're scared half to death. I must not get queasy very easily, as I had no problem with it. As for the cussing- the lines were ad-libbed, the actors are college-age, and all three sound exactly like every American college student I've ever known. So maybe people have a problem with young peoples' language, but what else is new? That's not a flaw of the movie- it's realism and part of why so many more young people found TBWP scary.I think at least some of the dissention in opinions is caused by generational and cultural differences. My mother's friends told me it wasn't scary, but that 'Psycho' terrified them. 'Psycho', while interesting and a classic, is not the least bit scary to me. 'The Excorcist' has only a couple scenes that I find frightening, but my mom breaks out in goosebumps at the mere mention of it. The scariest thing I ever saw until I watched this movie was a reel in a collection of horror shorts: a woman walks into her house carrying groceries, drops her keys down her heating vent, bends down to try to get them, and something grabs her scarf. She struggles, but within a minute or two, she's drug down and strangled. The scarf goes slack, the woman is lying dead on her floor, and that's it.TBWP is about what you *can't see*, about how your fear of the unknown is so much worse than what the unknown could probably ever be. The characters were not even necessarily likable, but they were *familiar*- Heather is the girl I sit next to in film class who thinks she has all the answers. Their mundane existence, captured in the beginning of the film, roots them in reality. What happens to them is terrifying because they are so every day, so interchangable with millions of other college kids. And, finally, you never know whether the Witch exists or not. Everything that happens can be explained away by coincidence, pranksters, bats, hunger, exhaustion and imaginations run wild with fear- or you can choose not to explain them away.Young Americans are not scared of much- school shootings can roll off us like water, the evil human beings inflict on each other is run-of-the-mill 6 o'clock news, we are raised in a culture that claims to worship a vengeful, elitist god while almost everyone is hypocritical and uses the power of spirituality as a way to abuse others. We are in information overload from birth. What we fear is not knowing. And in the Black Hills Woods of Maryland, just beyond the flashlight's reach, something is making strange and terrible noises- but we don't know what it is.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I really wanted to enjoy it!!!!,"Well, here we are in this woods (which doesn't seem to have a lot of trees; it looks more like a city park).  But we have wandered in far enough to get ourselves turned around. That's cool.  We are already spooked by the legends and our minds are playing games with us.  One of our problems is that we are all so self centered (nineties kinds of people) that we don't listen.  We whine, we complain, we don't think.  We film everything creatively but we also have a really stupid streak.  I thought the actors were very good. It's what they portrayed that bothered me.  Wouldn't it be good to have a look at what was going on outside the tent at night. It could have been a fringe group of the Girl Scouts.  Why was it categorically accepted that a fire should not be set.  If the witch is out there, then wouldn't you want to see it, or at least let it get itself singed.  Hey, you're in a tent. What could be more unprotected (we all know the stories about grizzley bears that treat small tents as doggy bags). Hey, maybe we could put someone at the door and let the others sleep!!! Why do we start running?  Where are we going?  There's nothing chasing us.  The power of suggestion takes over a little quickly here.  Why go into that house?  Why try to find that guy?  I mean, your first order of business is to find a way back. I felt for them and I thought the frantic camera work was interesting.  I just couldn't get past the stupidity of the people and their lack of survival instincts and self protectiveness. I agree that experimental cinema is wonderful and I'm glad that this has done well. Hollywood gets pretty tiresome.  But this movie didn't click with me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Is there a zero option in that voting menu?,"Is there?  Because if there is, I want to see it.  I went to see this movie because all my friends told me that it would scare me.

It was so unbelievably asinine and stupid that I can't believe it even got picked up for distribution, much less called ""great"".  I can't believe it made the amount of money it did.  I should have demanded a refund.  Let's put it this way -- if I took a few of my friends into the woods, with a video camera, and made scary noises at them so that they could pretend to scream, it would undoubtedly be scarier and superior to this movie.  I'm sorry, but those ""blair witch"" noises sounded exactly like someone playing a prank on them.  A waste of my $7.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"From someone who watched it back in 1999, but didn't know about the marketing.","When this film came out I was in the Army Basic training, and back then a new recruit was completely cut from the rest of the world. I only learned about this film because I hear about it from someone else. I had zero knowledge about the sleazy marketing campaign.As we were going to the movies. I heard that this was supposed to be a real found documentary from three missing young film makers. I hate to say this, but you have to have been an idiot back in 1999 to believe this. I know that back then the internet was still considered for weirdos and friendless dorks. Still, there is no such thing as witches or ghosts....so yeah, apparently there are a lot of stupids roaming in cars in our communities.When I watched I absolutely loved it, and thought it was very scary, and it gave me the shivers. The Blair Witch Project is obviously not made for the contemporary audience, especially for the younger audience of today. For several reasons, one is that I think the young audience, has already seen plenty of movies made in a faux documentary stile...but this was the 1st for me, and the audience of when this movie first came out.But, I suspect there is another reason why this movie is much less favorably received, buy the audience of today. You see, back in 1999 when you are 18 or 20 years old. Children, were not addicted to their phones, video games, and a cornucopia of crap to watch on streaming services.We at that time spent a lot of time outdoors, camping, hiking, and without the aid of hand held GPS devices or cell phones. This is where The Blair Witch Project shines. Back then it was a real possibility get lost in the woods, without the aid of tech such as simply calling for help anytime you like. Even getting lost in your car could be quite an experience, as in locating a gas station and having to rely on strangers with strange dialects for direction.Being alone in your tent in the night without any quick support, things breaking outside your tent, leaves falling and scraping the tent exterior, and animals making strange sounds, was a real cause for alarm. And this type of experience really resonated with me. Like getting lost and starting to panic, etc. And when you introduce an element of actual unexplained monsters into the scenario was actually quite terrifying (just got a bit of the shivers thinking about it).I am not surprised that The Blair Witch Project doesn't resonate well today, and especially with young audience smothered, by helicopter parents of today...and I know plenty of these parents now, lol. Man we used to get kicked out of the house, lol, and it was perfectly normal.So, I still recommend this film to younger ""high-tech"" audience, because of this film's importance in cinema history, and if you happen to make it this far in my review. To be scared, you really have to keep in mind, the mindset of the people back in 1999. No cell phones, LED lights, no massive flood lights at every rural property, population density is less than by 35% than in 2024. And if you get hurt, like due to dehydration, or cut yourself, or just run out of gas, no one is coming for a long time. And when the help comes it will be from a complete stranger who sees your emergency lights. You step outside in almost compete darkness, and you hear a snort-wheeze from an angry mature buck for the first time, I promise you it sounds like some monster out of the movies...how would that make you feel?Enjoy!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not your average horror film,"A film which fell foul of its own publicity machine, `The Blair Witch Project' was abhorred and derided by the mainstream film-going public which it became unfortunately directed at due to its extraordinary and outlandish marketing campaign. `The Blair Witch Project' is not a typical film that the typical cinema-going public would normally be exposed to. The camera-work is jerky, the dialogue repetitive and inane and the action virtually non-existent. At times confusing, annoying, irritating and tedious, this film is nonetheless a brilliant piece of arthouse experimental film-making. This movie is virtually all style-there's hardly any plot, no real action, no semblance of a real script-and one that works on a deeper psychological level than the standard mainstream horror film. Indeed, only the very last image in the film is truly frightening, and only if it can be correlated to an incident at the very beginning. The rest of it only becomes scary afterwards, when the audience has had time to consider what they've seen. It is groundbreaking, manipulative cinema made without a script, with an amateur cast and with little or no post-production values. This is a remarkable film which can only really be appreciated, if the accompanying hype is overlooked, as a unique, avant-garde art film and not the regular Hollywood stock it was presented as to the public.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Gripping, stunning film, the absolute thriller!!","Privileged to see a preview of this fantastically terrifying film, I found myself actually feeling the pain and mind-numbing anguish of the characters. At times in the movie, I would find myself trying to peer through the darkness with them, fully realizing that there was absolutely no chance of knowing what was out there.  I think that is the most effective aspect of this, the fear of the unknown.  I really can't think of anything more frightening than something that has no identity, and so you don't know how to relate or react, and you are forced to suffer through the unknown.  A key component also included in this film was the steady decline of human spirit that you witness first-hand.  You watch as the characters are broken down to small, scared, hunted animals, and you find yourself shaking your head at how pitiful and helpless they have become, yet you don't feel sorry for them, only agonizing hope that they will escape the fear with at least their lives.  Wonderfully created film that, at least for me, an outdoor enthusiast who used to enjoy wandering alone through familiar woods, will always haunt me to the core of my soul when I look around and see nothing but endless woods, unknown sounds, and things that are never seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"if it looks like S%#t, and it sounds like S%#t, then it must be S%#t!","If you thought that ""Star Wars Episode 1"" was the most over-hyped letdown of the year, get ready.  ""The Blair Witch Project"" is so shockingly bad it could have been made by your ninth grade brother's friends on their first camping trip this summer.  Shot primarily with a poor quality video (which appears to pre-date steadyshot), ""Blair Witch"" should have had a hard time getting into student film and video festivals based on the poor visual and sound quality alone.  Instead, it has won prizes and accolades at both Cannes and Sundance, and has become the new indie darling of film critics most everywhere. But, ""Blair Witch"" is far scarier than many of the critics have even begun to hint at.  It's basically 80 minutes of watching amateurs stuck in flat woods, running in circles, with no concept of shot composition, no script, no performance talent, and absolutely no idea of what the hell they are doing.  This is the movie that puts the 'horror' in horrible.""Blair Witch"" is supposed to be about the making of a documentary.  Is this supposed to represent a documentary film crew? A girl who is a complete bitch, and two dweebs who act like whiny versions of Beavis and Butt-head. The interminable fits of yelling and screaming will have you bored stiff. Do stick figures made of wood, and the sounds of nearby ""filmmakers"" making funny noises in the woods give you the creeps?...if so, you might actually find this frightening.Well, as audiences everywhere are finding out (as Cinemascore is indicating), ""The Blair Witch Project"" is not a good film, and certainly not what they were told it would be.  Shame on critics making comparisons to horror classics like ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". Those were bold masterpieces of terror in which the scripts were solid before production began.  Jeez, even ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"" was scarier than ""Blair Witch"" (if Jennifer Love's breasts get any bigger...) Any dolt can do what the makers of ""Blair Witch"" have done, just look at the worst home videos your neighbor Larry has in his collection (but Larry knows how to use that tripod his wife bought him last Xmas).To quote Bart Simpson from that great Halloween episode with Poe's ""The Raven""; ""Do you know what would have been scarier than nothing?.....................ANYTHING!!""",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Inventive and terrifying. Will spawn many imitations.,"With all the hype surrounding this new independent horror film, you might think it would be hard for it to live up to expectations. The Blair Witch Project is probably as scary as it's reputation. Feel free to read on, I do not intend to give away any of the film's secrets or surprises. The less you know about this creepy little chiller, the better.Filmed on video and 16mm black & white, this film is exactly what the horror genre needs in a time reminiscent of the early 1980s slasher onslaught. The Blair Witch Project has no knife wielding maniacs, no DNA altered monsters, and no real bloodshed onscreen. We see what the three film makers see as they make their way through the deep, dank woods in search of a legendary witch. There are times when there is nothing but a black screen, and all we can do is listen to their scared voices and the unexplained noises going on around them. The true horror behind this film is the unknown, and those dark places where you know something is lurking.If you are a seasoned veteran of the horror cinema, The Blair Witch Project may be less frightening than for someone who has not seen many scary movies. You will have to respect it's originality, and it's manipulation of our deepest fears. At times the film really makes you feel the sense of dread the film makers are experiencing. One thing I did notice about the audience in the theater is that everyone was very quiet. Except for an occasional gasp, the moviegoers were absorbed in this film. That's unusual for a modern horror movie. Most are full of fake scare tactics and multiple twist endings that keep the audience shouting and screaming at the screen. One thing for sure, you can expect many imitations of The Blair Witch Project in the future. Isn't that how it usually goes?",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Garbage,"I can't believe I wasted my time watching this. Maybe the most over-hyped, overrated movie (if you want to call it that) of all time. GhostBusters is more scary than this piece of junk.

"Not ""scary as hell"", but still good","I've never seen the tide turn on movie reviews before like I did in THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. First, I heard this movie was the scariest movie since THE EXORCIST, then I heard it was the worst movie of the year. When people thought it might be real, they loved it. Then, when everyone found out it was fake, I heard all sorts of bad things about it.THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is about three young filmmakers, Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Josh Leonard (actors with same names as their characters), go out into the woods of Burkittesville, Maryland to do a documentary on the mythical Blair Witch. They are never found, but a year later their footage is discovered, and it seems to indicate that there really was a witch and it was stalking these three filmmakers.I did not find THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT especially scary, although it was rather spooky. I did think it was good, with an excellent and very original plot. The acting in this movie by the three young kids was very good, especially if the rumors about how they improvised most of it were true. The character development was well done, and you will often find yourself waiting for daylight along with the characters.Was this movie overhyped? A little, but I think if it wasn't that it wouldn't have been as successful, since the actors, writers and directors are relatively unknown. They did a very good job and I hope to see more works from them in the near future.Sure, some of the realism could've been better. Even I knew that they should've followed the stream out of the woods instead of going deeper into the forest. And if this was happening to me, I doubt I'd pick up the video camera and tape it all instead of running like hell. But it still worked. I think the scariest part is how you don't see as much as you hear, because often the sound is 10 times worse than the thing making the sound.This movie isn't too scary, but if you watch it in the middle of the night with all your lights off and alone, it will successfully freak you out. It's worth a rent or a buy, judge for yourself.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
THE Horror Movie,First time watching this film and I'm pleasantly surprised. I've grown up hearing about it and I always thought it couldn't really be as creepy or impactful. Surely it was actually obviously fake. But I was wrong. The acting is so good and everything that happens and their reactions are realistic. It's not over the top but just right.I would watch this once a year. I wanted a behind the scenes video after to get less scared but they don't exist because they were so dedicated to it being real.If I was a movie seeing person at the time it came out I would have never left my house again. But alas. I have to leave my house.,7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Overly hyped pile of horse manure,"Some observations:Anyone who thinks this movie is scary has lived a sheltered life, indeed.Those who gave this dreck anything higher than a ""5"" probably bought pet rocks when they were on the market.This flick will go down in history as another ""Billy Jack."" (Remember it was getting high ratings for the first few years.)As far as one of the producers saying he noticed people vomiting after having seen the movie, they were probably made physically ill at having thought of being ripped off like they had been.This flick sucks beyond words....",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"The birth of ""Found Footage""","It hardly needs saying that ""The Blair Witch Project"" sparked a flurry of ""found footage"" movies in the first part of the 2000's, some were good, some just ok & others were appallingly bad. TBW project itself is not a brilliant film but it should be called the pioneer of the genre which then became a household name.Set in October 1994, it tells the story of a small team of three young investigators who are making a documentary on ""The Blair Witch"" legend in the woods of Maryland. On entering the woods they chat to two fishermen who tell the story of ""Coffin Rock"" where alleged human sacrifices were made which they film & chat about as they start to make camp for the night. The next day they continue into the woods, but tempers get freyed as they start to realise they are in fact lost...This film actually works if you consider it to be an experimentle art house movie, because it is certainly not a mainstream horror movie. In fact horror fans like me will be appalled at the lack of horror in BWP as almost all the suspence is suggestive. Also be prepared for a film that is non scripted & contains annoying repeated phrase words, very bad camera work (pehaps this goes with the type of film this is) & unproffessional acting. This movie is unpolished, because it is supposed to be, as it's amature in it's conception. The main character, Heather is really annoying, as well as being loud, brash & bossy which makes her unrelatable & left me feeling sorry for the other two guys, who are both nastily hen-pecked. So much so I think they scarpered just to get away from Heathers whining!Well for a movie that spawned a whole new genre in horror/suspence, you would be expecting it to be rated higher, but I think a 6 is fair. If you understand the genre, it is watchable, but mainstream horror fans should avoid this, as they will find it without substance & shallow. There are no special effects, no sound track & no visable antagonist. The BWP is simply a raw, bare bones movie making expierence, with s creepy romp in the woods as a back drop. It is also a short movie which I feel will keep people from being bored. It has minimal bad language, no nudity, no gore (beyond a blob of something) & no agenda, which I think is suitable for age 14 plus.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the smartest and most excellently shot horror movies where what we don't see is what really makes us afraid.,"I was too young to be able to see this movie when it first hit theaters, but I saw it a few days ago at home, although it's obviously not the same thing. Even so, I was really pleased with what I found. It's not an absolutely perfect film, there are some things there that I would change, if I were the director, but they are issues of such little importance that I feel that they do not detract from any merit or quality from the finished work.The film was a quasi-experimental production, with a very low budget, with young and unknown actors. However, the quality is evident and is intelligently associated with the advertising campaign that was put together to sell it and make it profitable. In fact, this film is perhaps one of the best examples to show the importance and weight of publicity for the receptivity and commercial success of a film: even today there are people who believe that the story told in the film is real, that the Witch really existed, that those young people really disappeared...The actors' work is impeccable. After reading a bit, I discovered the importance of the way the film was shot for the final result, with the actors alone, isolated in the woods, firmly believing in what they were doing and permanently in the characters. They lived the experience, and they believed in it. They weren't acting for us, they were acting for themselves and believing in their acting, giving the characters a real personality, worthy of our compassion and sympathy. This turns out to be something that holds and seduces us to a certain extent, leading us to wish that everything is true, although we do not wish any harm to any of the actors, of course. They are also responsible for all the shooting work, and their poor ability to shoot in 16 mm explains why the film has such shaky and amateurish cinematography, even though this is intentional and something that makes it more genuine in our eyes.Stripped of expensive effects, great technical apparatus or other resources, the film bets everything on extremely basic but functional resources, and on an almost military discipline that prevailed throughout the eight days of shooting, in which the actors maintained minimal contact with a production that acted like a ""big brother"", attentive and watchful but invisible. Children's voices over loudspeakers, the strategic waving of the tent at the right moment, sticks that break without anyone seeing... simple but scary resources when you're alone, in the middle of a dark place, where anything can happen and no one will know. What is frightening about this film is not what we see, but the anticipation, the skillfully constructed tension, the almost certain prospect of a disaster that we don't know when it will happen. It is our imagination and our mind that frightens us, suggested by the film. And I don't see how terror can work more subtly and intelligently.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"love or hate it, it started a new genre","Love or hate it, it's the film that started a new era in the horror genre, the found footage. It's true, Cannibal Holocaust (1980) started it all but this flick came out in the beginning of the internet. The Web was something that everybody started to know and this flick was well promoted on that way. Not everybody was comfortable with the web and giving nothing away except the title did the thing. I was in the US when it was promoted and yes, you did believe what you saw.Cannibal Holocaust surely was a found footage but it was all about cannibalism. And it's there that Holocaust fitted in. The Blair Witch was controversial because love or hate, no in between was possible. Some were afraid seeing it others fell asleep. But it do has a few creep moments especially the night scenes.Is it all that great, that's the big issue because the only effects used are done with branches and stones. And that's just why it all looked real.The remake is now a few days before release so I will surely go watch it. Therefor I recommend to see the original one which also spawned a sequel that was terrible.

"SO BAD, IT'S SCARY","This is the worst waste of film I have ever witnessed in my life. I cannot fathom what people who loved this movie are thinking. WOW! The ""actors"" seem to be talking off the cuff, the script- if there was one, lacked any imagination or anything clever to say.  Movies that have parodied this crappy movie do a better job of conveying fear. I understand the premise, of course. Make the movie appear like a home movie where some young people encounter some weird and horrific experiences. The problem is, most vacation home movies are more compelling and clever. Whenever there was a hint of tension, the actor would swear or scream, for lack of anything better they could think of. This film experience was memorable to me and those who watched it with me, for one reason. It is easily the worst I have ever seen.

My teacher gives me extra credit if I post this :),"The Blair Witch Project illustrates a chilling story that still holds up even after over twenty years. The story is about a group of film students who attempt to investigate the myth of The Blair Witch in their small town. The storyline of the main character getting lost can come across as a bit boring because there is not much action but, the psychology of the group is entertaining throughout. Most of the movie takes place in the woods. The cast being lost in an unfamiliar environment and hearing noises outside of their tents creates suspense. The viewers are just as unaware of what is truly out there as the cast is. Actor Heather Donahue's character of the same name seems to be the leader out of the three as she is strong minded and intelligent. The writer, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez, make it a point to challenge Heather's confidence while the group gets lost in the woods. Both Mike and Josh are very quick to undermine Heather and Donahue's character becomes more and more uncertain as the days in the woods go on. Possibly the scariest thing about the movie was how raw the acting was. The cast attempt to collaborate on many occasions but these attempts are futile. The characters, Mike, Josh, and Heather's fighting is almost constant throughout the movie and never becomes less effective. On the contrary, the arguments become more impactful as the film goes on. This progression of banter to full blown meltdowns was very realistic and the writers did an excellent job with the pacing of the characters. While in the woods, Mike and Josh have a tendency to team up against Heather as the mens patience isn't durable. Even after Mike throws the map into the river, the group's main target is Heather. Josh is especially aggressive and churlish towards Heather. Actor Joshua Leonard's performance of this character creates a tense and uneasy atmosphere allowing the audience to more easily experience suspense. This tension is especially prevalent when Josh yells in Heather's face saying she doesn't know anything and she's the reason they're lost. Even when Heather starts crying, Josh continues showing how violent the woods have made them. This scene and Mike almost representing the viewer watching this outburst, makes the viewer feel both Heather and Josh's emotions. This mix makes the viewer experience the same anxiety that is consuming the group and has been the entire movie. Because the whole movie is filmed on handheld cameras, it convinces the audience that the events seen occurred in real life. The movie is presented in such a way that there is a blurry line between fact and fiction. A horror movie might be scary but a ""real event"" shows viewers that the same thing could happen to them making it one of the scariest movies for it's time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I am STILL waiting to get my money back...,"Somebody actually compared this to Hitchcock? I felt ill when I saw that. I actually tried very hard to go to sleep during this movie just because I thought it might seem to be over a little faster. I absolutely did not buy in to the characters. I rooted for the witch, which to her credit never showed up in the film. Good move on her part. I wish I hadn't been there either.When they got to the map sequence, I actually wanted them all to die. I had absolutely no sympathy for these jerks. Yes, I know we are supposed to believe the ""witch"" caused all these things - loosing the map, walking in circles, etc. I just didn't buy it. What I did buy was a bunch of idiots went wandering around in the woods. There was no witch - these people were just too stupid to be allowed to live, and thankfully Darwinism kicked in before they polluted the gene pool further. I hope... I am absolutely serious when I say I was rooting for the witch, by the way, but she took too long.I was not scared at any point during this film. I was extremely irritated. I would have killed them myself. The only good thing about this movie is that it IS only 80 minutes long - which reduces the amount of time you have to endure. I have a good imagination, and like it when a talented director lets the action happen in my head as much as on the screen.

Most Over-hyped Movie I've Ever Seen,"I've seen worse movies, but not many.  Yes, I like horror films.

I don't lack imagination, but this movie certainly did.  I've seen Tampax commercials that filled me with greater fear.  The film lacked wit, style, story, plot, suspense, or verve.  I don't need expensive cinematography or stellar acting, but a film does need something to redeem itself (other than a sophomoric, if marginally clever, idea), and this film did not have it.It is unfortunate that a bad movie has come to represent to many the epitome of independent cinema.

"It hasn't aged well, and it didn't have to. You don't have to love it in order to appreciate the genius.","Not being that in touch with Horror hype I haven't heard about the third Blair Witch installment until rather recently, so I've decided to watch the first films again (it has literally been over a decade). So after watching this title again I checked some of the trivia details and some web articles, a process which has lead me to the unfortunate conclusion that I can't recommend TBWP to any new spectators.The story is quite simple (which is part of why it works). Three film students travel to an old city surrounded by woodlands in pursuit of information about ""The Blair Witch"", something between local folklore, an urban legend and a myth. The videotape some sites, interview some locals, and head for the woods for a night of camping before heading back to civilization. That's when things start to get wrong, as the trio gets hopelessly lost, tensions become high and someone (or something) obviously tries to make them feel unwelcome.I know, thinking of that setting almost makes you able to visualize some of the scenes, and most chances are you wouldn't be far from what's actually shown in the film. That's because most Horror fans (and even certain fans of mainstream cinema) have by now seen titles exemplifying how the ""Found Footage"" sub-genre has improved and matured over the years (and I'd say it has become boring and tedious, but that's just my own thoughts and isn't relevant). No, in order to appreciate the Blair Witch you had to have been there, way back at the turning point of the millennium, when there still hadn't been a ""Found Footage"" sub-genre and perhaps two films (UFO Abduction of 1989 and its remake Alien Abduction of 1998) have ever used the ""documentary"" shooting style in a thriller or Horror film. I was too young to take part in the hype, but from I've collected - a website came up telling of a videotape found in a deserted camera in the woods near what used to be the town of ""Blair"". With no reason not to - people believed it. With no information to contradict this intuitive conclusion - people thought they were actually going to watch an authentic found footage. The producers handed out ""Missing"" flyers of the students (actually a cast of two actors and an actress) during the debut screening in the festival, the cast itself was forbidden by contract to make any public appearances, and most spectators simply didn't know any better.Think about it. The web page. The characters' names being identical to the cast's names. Missing person flyers. A footage which in all standards looks precisely like a real documentary. Who could have known? Who would have guessed but the cynics and nay-sayers (who have an annoying habit of being right)? Watching the film under the impression the events were real would indeed justify the film being unofficially dubbed ""the scariest movie of all times"". And as much as it might today seem average at best both as a Horror title in general and as a ""Found Footage"" film specifically - numbers don't lie: 40k budget, near 300m earnings. That is how you make a legend.If any of the anecdotes (true as far as I've been able to track) mentioned here have made you curious and you wish to experience the thrill over two decades after - go right ahead and watch this, just don't expect to have your mind blown. Remember, this is the film which officially gave birth to the Found Footage sub-genre, it was a cinematic and creative breakthrough, but s was the light bulb (and you're reading this on a computer or portable device). If you'd rather enjoy the legacy - go watch any other Found Footage Horror out there (any Paranormal Activity title comes to mind, of course) and know that it wouldn't be here without the pioneering genius of the Blair Witch Project.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Please excuse my incoherent ramblings: I was up late last night watching an over-rated horror film.,"I had always thought that arachnophobia—the fear of spiders—was the most common of phobias, but thanks to The Blair Witch Project, I now know better: the irrational fear of small twigs and pebbles is far more prevalent. It's the only explanation I have for the phenomenal worldwide success of a horror film in which stick figures and tiny piles of stones are considered to be the stuff of nightmares?Whilst I am, of course, fully aware that big sticks and stones can break your bones (as the childhood saying goes), inanimate small pieces of rock and the lesser of branches hold no real fear for me. As a result, I didn't find The Blair Witch Project anywhere near as frightening as the millions who are afflicted by Stickstonophobia (surprisingly, I could find no official scientific term for this widespread condition, so I coined this one myself!).Admittedly, I did find some of the strange noises that occurred during the night fairly creepy (after all, they might have been made by big spiders), and the way that the film-makers were unable to find their way back to their car was unsettling (I've lost my bearings in the woods myself, and this brought back bad memories), but the ending—when Heather and Mike enter the dilapidated old house at the end of the film—was simply frustrating: surely everyone knows that derelict houses are deathtraps.Sure enough, both characters lose their footing on the obviously rotten floors and die.

Don't close your eyes -- Elly Kedward will get you.,"It is to the ""Blair Witch"" filmmakers' (and I am talking about Myrick and Sanchez, not Donahue, Leonard, and Williams) great credit that for the most part, they get away with the central conceit that three tired, hungry, lost, and above all, frightened-out-of-their-minds documentarians would still keep rolling footage under the dire circumstances in which they find themselves -- for that is one of the movie's only shortcomings (even though the majority of the audience won't notice or won't mind).  The Project's plus column, however, is far longer than the minus one, as the very fabric of the improvisational techniques employed holds together an authenticity virtually guaranteed to send shivers down the backs of all but the most road-hardened horror vets.  The interplay among Donahue, Leonard, and Williams is refreshingly funny in the early stages, which only ratchets up the intensity when doom seems to be knocking (or howling or scratching or leaving creepy tokens outside the campers' tent).  The Blair Witch Project has all of the necessary sequences to assure its cult status (I love the stick figures) and the mysterious, dread-filled ending will most certainly set fans arguing -- once they catch their breath.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
justifies all the attention it received upon it's release,"This was one of the scarier horror films I've seen and for that alone I can call it a great film. Having seen it many years after it was made, I missed all the hype surrounding The Blair Witch Project upon it's initial release. I had heard many different opinions from different people; it seemed like a 50/50 divide between who liked it and who didn't. That probably levelled my expectations as I simply didn't know what to expect. But I really enjoyed it and some parts of the film were the 'heart-pounding-hard-in-your-chest' moments you expect from all horror films, except that they were amplified by a heightened sense of reality with the documentary-style filming. This is ultimately what the film relies on for it's horror of course; it draws you very close to the hearts and minds of the characters involved and you genuinely feel scared for them. So many horror films simply have characters 'made for dying', that you don't really care about and are just included to eventually become victims.I am a fan of the low-budget, low-gore style it employs, simply because it still scares you regardless. There are some flaws in the editing style needed to be employed to make it realistic (ie. times when it is unrealistic for them to have their camera switched on, but would be very scary to watch for the audience) and I did feel the film came to a quite abrupt end. But it is also very necessary to applaud the actors, who are part of the reason the film is so believable. Overall, you can't fault the way in which this film helped reinvigorate the horror genre. With the number of mindless slasher films reaching stupid levels in the mid-90s - Friday 13th Part 9 was released in 1993 and A Nightmare On Elm Street 7 in 1994... - I can still feel today, even watching it 8 years later, how important this film was.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The sounds and the way it was filmed is what makes this movie an excellent horror flick.  The sounds are excellent.  The movie was filmed bad (because the camera movies up and down as the person holding it walks) but that only makes it more realistic since the person filming the movie is supposed to be one of the kids who is filming the documentary. ( not a person trained on how to use a camera.) It all goes along with making it seem like it is a true story.  This has to have been one of the best independent films I have seen since Halloween.  It is a movie worth seeing and I give it 7 out of 10 stars.,7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Cinema Verite Fright...,"Is THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT a masterful ghost film or a gimmick to create a multi-media event?  It is both.  The picture, shot on super 8 video and 16mm film displayed in a squared, documentary-like frame, is quirky, annoying, and spectacularly scary.  The scenes at night quite frankly scared the hell out of me.  The gimmick that THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is created confusion and wonder over whether or not the footage shot was real life.  Now, we all know the truth, but the French term 'cinema verite' is defined by this grisly film.A guaranteed cult classic, BLAIR WITCH has ""Heather, Mike, and Josh"" heading off into the allegedly hexed woods of Maryland looking for the Blair Witch or whatever else may exist up in those hills.  For most of the film, it is very unclear.  The beginning excerpts ingeniously set up the three participants to believe they are a) experiencing the supernatural, b) being played like a fiddle by the suspicious townspeople or c) just completely out of their minds.  Its up to the viewer to decide but my money is on option A.Most filmgoers know that the filmmakers Sanchez and Myrick used their MAC cards and cookie jars to put this phenom together and I commend them.  This is a tour-de-force thriller that does indeed seem real.  Its all improvised and 'verite' like and the best part about the movie's many chills are based on the basic premise that scares most of us:  We are generally frightened by what we cannot see.  Many times throughout the film, the screen is completely dark with sudden bursts of screams and grainy scenery.  For the sake of the suspense, the film may have been better if we did not know the gimmick.  The realism is sometimes smothering.True, the hand-held camera can make you achy in the head, but the way the actors play off each other is magic and not for the faint of heart.  I viewed the film on DVD with someone who was not feeling too well because of the dizzying camera, but somehow the black and white and color and rain blend together and allow Myrick and Sanchez to do what they were attempting to do.  Spooking an audience with unseen forces is so effective and I was reminded of Robert Wise's original THE HAUNTING from 1963 with the groans and the cries and the shrieks.  A baby's giggle can be heard during one spellbinding scene when the tent the 3 students sleep in takes on a life of its own.Much has been made about a similar film made in similar fashion by some other young auteurs well before THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was released.  I never saw it and if it was as good as this film we would've seen it. Nonetheless, this past summer shocked and surprised me with the amount of good horror pictures around.  In the woods, no one can hear you scream either.Rating: ***1/2",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
no Bang for my buck.,"the Blair Witch Project was funnier than it was scary...not funny in a cynical I've-seen-it-all-you-can't-scare-me way, but funny with funny characters and dialogue.  the movie lacked a payoff....I thought the actors did a great job, but it was a movie.....even if the claim that this is found footage of a missing film crew, someone had to edit it into a film.....it ended like I was to believe that I was watching raw footage that was found later......but I couldn't believe that....so I never felt any terror or even more than apprehension, waiting for something to go ""boo!""  so I left wanting more...",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
This is the worst movie ever made,"""The Blair Witch Project"" is in my mind the worst movie in history. It is the most boring and non-entertaining movie I have seen; it goes absolutely know where.

It Holds Up Just Enough,"Ever since its release 20 years ago, The Blair Witch Project has made history as a cultural horror phenomenon, mainly for how it utilized the found footage genre without showing much of what the real horror is. While it did divide audiences back in the day, the intrigue of the film lies a lot more in what we hear rather than what is actually causing hysteria. It's a testament to how divisive the film is when even though what was videotaped did actually happen in real life, just the thought of what lies out in the middle of nowhere is enough to make one feel at ease.Now understandably, the film has a very simplistic plot, in which three young filmmakers named Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard seek out the local legend called the Blair Witch infamously located at the Black Hills near Burkittsville, Maryland in 1994, but they all disappear and the film plays out as a feature length collection of raw footage based on what they experienced. Admittedly, the film doesn't have a great start, as the leads come off as more annoying and obnoxious than likable and charming, and not much happens besides them goofing off for the first twenty minutes. However, as the film progresses, strange oddities start to occur and slowly heighten the stakes with every passing day. The very idea of being lost in the deep woods can really affect someone mentally, so even without the supernatural aspects, the movie works well in playing with the viewer's expectations with suspenseful tension.One major problem with most found footage movies is that the creatures feared by the cast are either always seen or are in a typical environment we're all familiar with. The better way to create paranoia within your horror narrative is by placing your characters somewhere they've never been before. Also, the decision to have many of the night scenes be pitch black and out of focus really helps the soundtrack, as all the crazy sounds coming from the area feel all the more terrifying without knowing where they are coming from. What people hear is more reactionary than what they see, and the filmmakers react so well to what they hear that the audience could be in their shoes as well. Even then, as the film goes on, Heather, Mike and Josh become much more relatable with their ever-growing impatience and frustrations with the whole legend itself, whether it's fake or not, and even towards each other with anger and fear. The more away from civilization you are, the less human you become.So while it may be slow paced and the idea of not seeing the real terror can be a turnoff to some viewers, I definitely think The Blair Witch Project stands well on its own after its original release. Regardless if this whole movie is complete fiction, crafting a whole narrative around the supernatural in a place as unknown as a forest at night can work if you center it around the idea of implication rather than flat out showing the creature. All you need is a shoestring budget, a cast of people you know personally as opposed to famous celebrities, and an environment you're familiar with enough to let your small camera create practically everything. In spite of the found footage genre being somewhat of a joke nowadays, there is nothing stopping you from taking on the challenge of forming a film around raw recorded material.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Sad how this movie has such a low rating here,"I can't believe that The Blair Witch Project has such a low rating here at IMDb. Guys, this an intelligent horror movie that changed a lot of things on how movies in general are made today (not only the horror genre).* This is the movie that basically created the Found Footage genre. I know that there were some Found Footage movies before, but this was the movie that made it popular. There are thousands of Found Footage movies nowadays like Chronicle, Cloverfield, REC and so many others that wouldn't exist without the Blair Witch Project.* This is movie that made it popular the viral marketing campaigns. For several blockbusters nowadays, it's almost obligatory to have a marketing campaign and this is the movie that created that!And besides all that, this is a horror movie with a great story.

These 3 Film Students Were The Ultimate Flunkies,"I'd confidently say that this film has got to be one of the biggest movie-swindles ever perpetrated on a completely unsuspecting audience.With a devilishly clever publicity campaign to fuel its release, The Blair Witch Project (TBWP, for short) became the 2nd most successful ""indie"" film of all time, grossing nearly $250 million. Its success was surpassed in 2002 by My Big Fat Greek Wedding.Directed by Eduardo Sanchez, TBWP is presented as a documentary pieced together from amateur footage and filmed in real time. TBWP was shot in a matter of just 8 days and all of the dialogue was, pretty much, improvised.TBWP tells the tale of 3 young Film Students who hike out into the Black Hills near Burkittsville, Maryland to film a documentary about a local legend known as The Blair Witch.The viewer is told that these 3 students were never found, although their video and sound equipment (along with the footage they shot) was discovered a year later.In my opinion, TBWP completely fails to deliver on all counts.*Trivia Note* - Throughout the course of the story the word ""Fukk"" was spoken 154 times. With this film having a running time of 87 minutes, that averages out to about one ""Fukk"" every 45 seconds.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Definitely  worth seeing...one time is enough..It stays w/you,"I saw this movie the week before the nation wide release.  With the SciFi Channel and the www.blairwitch.com giving the background to the Blair Witch, it is easy to mistake this move as non-fiction.  Even after I knew it was fictional, I was still enthralled with the movie.  I left it forgetting that it was fake.The shaking of the camera is not that bad, kind of like hearing traffic outside the door...you tend to phase it out.  There are times, however, that I got a smirk at something that was supposed to be scary....AND there are times that something trivial scares the heebie jeebies out of me.I definitely recommend viewing the www.blairwitch.com or the SciFi special before watching the movie.

"A Precursor To ""Paranormal Activity"" (But Probably Even Better At What It Does)","Just recently, I read Stephen King's horror treatise ""Danse Macabre"". In that book, he discusses ""The Blair Witch Project"" as one of the most frightening movies he has ever seen. I decided to watch it on that recommendation, and I came away fascinated by the experience.For a basic plot summary, ""Blair Witch"" focuses on a group of three friends trying to produce an independent documentary about the so-called Blair Witch that haunts the woods surrounding a rural town. At first, the documentary seems to be going quite while, but when the trio gets lost in the woods and strange things start happening, things take a turn for the worse.Sadly, history will probably only remember this film for the controversy that surrounded it at the theater (people thinking that the documentary was actually a real thing). While it isn't an all-time classic, to be sure, it does produce some genuine emotion by touching on some very deep themes.Basically, this movie preys on those all-too-human emotions in which the ""monster behind the door"" (as King himself describes it) is much more scary when it is unseen. SPOILER ALERT HERE: During the entire entire, viewers never even catch so much as a glimpse of whatever/whoever is causing the strange happenings. It's the ultimate ""devil you don't know"" story.Yet, ""Blair Witch"" also works on a more human-drama level. Much like the later ""Cloverfield"", it is filmed entirely in the shaky-cam style, trying to be as close to human reality as possible. As the three hikers slowly begin to realize just how hopelessly lost they have become, parts of the film become a sort of character study in panic and emotion. Viewers begin to wonder ""would I react the same way in a similar situation?""Overall, I was more intrigued by ""Blair Witch"" than anything. It is amazing to me how a movie so stark and completely devoid of any conjured drama (no soundtrack, no ""jump scenes"", etc.) can still be a bit unsettling to watch. I have also seen the first ""Paranormal Activity"" movie, and I don't understand why that is viewed with such reverence while ""Blair Witch"" has to fight for every inch, so to speak. They are the same type of movie, but this effort actually shows the descent into panic/madness better than ""Paranormal"" ever did.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A Classic in the Genre,"Blair Witch Project, The (1999)**** (out of 4)The story is known by everyone as three filmmakers go into the wood to tell the story of the Blair Witch and soon they find themselves lost with something apparently coming for them. I remember the hype surrounding this film quite well and I remember my two viewings in the theater when the film originally opened. It's been about six years or more since I last watched the film so I was very curious going in as to how the film would hold up. After viewing the film I think it still holds up remarkably well and even though the hype has died down and much hates has been thrown upon the film, it still remains a rather chilling and all too realistic venture into basic fears. I think these basic fears can be the dark, being lost or hearing something when you shouldn't be hearing anything. These are three elements that make this film so effective because there isn't any blood, no monster, no killer and whatever is out there is something we never see. I think the greatness of the film, and something very important, is that the viewer is put into the action to where you can feel everything that the three filmmakers are going through. If you can imagine yourself lost in the woods then you should be able to know the fears going on with the filmmakers here. The movie does a marvelous job at various things but one is the start of the thing when we learn the history of the curse through the documentary set up. A perfect move. We hear from locals, various myths and then we slowly get put into the action. The set up wasn't original as the ""lost video footage"" was used in CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST nearly twenty years earlier but the effectiveness of this film is that it takes that lost footage and uses it again the viewer to assault their fears. The performances are all very raw but that makes them effective in terms of everything going on. The direction and use of two cameras is also very effective but the most chilling aspect of the film is without a doubt its ending. I won't spoil anything but the final shot before the hit still send chills down my spine no matter how many times I've seen the film. Over the years this film has found many critics to hate on it but this is something that happens with countless popular horror films, which is a real shame. In a day and age where we can see anything, it's refreshing to watch a movie like this that shows us absolutely nothing yet works on every level.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

More than just marketing,"We know how this movie came to theaters: with (maybe) the best marketing campaign of all time. An internet website, the directors listing the actors as missing, create a local legend... that's some of the tactics used to make viewers think that this movie was real. Because that, some people thought that what they saw on Blair Witch was real (sorry, I love the marketing for this, but that's not really intelligent). And that's also thanks to the found footage technique they implemented to make the film. This type of filmmaking wasn't really new, we have films like Cannibal Holocaust, Guinea Pig, The Last Broadcast...and though some of them made some noise, Blair Witch was the one that, for better or for worse, popularized the 'sub-genre'.
Now, what is Blair Witch about? Is about three not-so-likable student filmmakers that go on to woods to make a documentary about a legend know as the Blair Witch. And that, is the perfect setting for a movie of this type. With a budget so low, what we get is just scenes of mad people lost in the forest, trying to get out of there. And because of that, the movie has some pacing issues, and audiences that like to consume the McDonald's equivalent of horror movies, will hate this.
Our three main guys do a excelent job conducting the story, more if you consider some of the reactions are real or are improv. The way the movies was made, with the actors throwed in the woods with some provisions and directions of what to do and filmed, is very clever, the night scenes are amazing because of that, the actors were actually frightened, and you can tell that. And that ending, is very powerful, it's one of my favorites from any horror film.
Yes, Blair Witch is an example of how you shold promote your film, but if you actually look at the film, you will realize this is a masterful take on the mockumentary genre. Recommended for anyone that has pacience and can appreciate a slow burn.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Inventive and original,"The Blair Witch Project had some pretty chilling moments. Some people in the theater were disappointed at the ending because the witch or whatever other horror was stalking the film students was never revealed. I thought the ending could have been a little better, but I liked the element of ambiguity and think that it adds to the terror of the movie. Being an avid woods man, I was annoyed with the stupidity of the students and how they handled their situation, but I guess it was necessary in order for the movie to work. Using the 16mm film added an incredible element of realism to the movie. This in my opinion was the movies strongest asset. The movie feels so believable  that many people in the theater actually thought they were watching real, authentic footage. The Blair Witch Project was an interesting movie, and if one allows themselves to become one of the campers and accept what is happening on screen, the movie is pretty darn chilling.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I understand they were supposed to be film 'students,' but my 10-year-old sister can shoot better footage than this.  At the end I was really wondering why I bothered to sit through the whole thing, and I was definitely sorry that I actually paid to see it in a theater.

The Godfather of Found Footage Horror,"People gotta understand that you don't always have to see the thing or that creature or whatever it is that has to be seen on camera JUST to be scary. Those are literally most of the bad reviews lol. What people don't understand these days unfortunately, is that it's scarier when you can only feel or hear the presence of something, rather than seeing it. It completely leaves a viewer's imagination open into letting them envision something for themselves. And this is something The Blair Witch Project did very correctly. They didn't rush it. They didn't show the supposed ""witch"" on camera. They gave us a very chilling aspect to where us as an audience can only hear the terror of what is going on, hear the screams, hear what is happening, and our brain senses something obviously but we CAN'T see it. Only hear it. THAT is why this is so freaking creepy. It's kind of a shame many people bash and put this down so much. This film was literally what started the spread and the rise of the Found Footage Horror sub genre. And there's been a quite a few good found footage films that have been made the past decade or so.

Wait until you can rent it.,"I finally saw this film, after hearing much about it from my friends.

I had a splitting headache by the end. If you tend to get motion sickness, you may wish to avoid this film.The Blair Witch Project represents the maximum result with a minimum budget. Unlike many low-budget films, it stays within its means. The film could not have been improved by putting more money into it. The acting was likewise very good.I'm not sure, however, that this was cut out to be a feature film. At 80 minutes it falls well short of full-length, but it felt more like 100 or 110 to me. The dialogue was repetitive, but little could be done to vary it. I would have enjoyed the film far more if it were 60 minutes. And maybe paired with another shorter film.I would also recommend not viewing this in the theater. The picture is filmed completely on videotape and 16mm, so the wide screen gives you no advantage. Unlike most horror films, The Blair Witch Project uses no shocking visual effects to frighten the audience. I found it difficult to be frightened by pure suspense in a crowded theater.

An Extremely Innovative Horror Flick but a bit of a Let Down,"The Blair Witch project is the 3rd film i'll be reviewing for my october/halloween special. This movie took the horror genre to a whole new level. I remember when this first came out the internet turned a small movie into a world wide sensation. A lot of people thought these events actually took place and who could blame them. They made news specials about the missing teens and even T.V. specials that made us believe that sometihng actually happened to these kids, Of course it turned out to be a brillant stunt by the filmmakers to make the movie seem more real. The film was shot entirely with a hand held camera and the acting was almost 100% improvised. When i first saw this movie i was impressed by its creativity but the final product kinda disappointed me.As you know the plot of the movie is about 3 people who venture into the woods to do a documentary on the blair witch and strange events occur and they a re never heard from again. one year later their footage is found and we get to see what led up to their mysterious disappearance. Pretty good plot that works really well. so far so good.The atmosphere really works. to me the woods is one of the scariest places to be and it really works for this film. Also being shot entirely on a hand held camera we get to experience first hand what the characters or doing or feeling. Blackouts and shaky camera movements add to the already great suspenseful tension.The acting is superb. Frist we get 3 funny and carefree young people who are very full of life but as the film progresses we see how fear is tearing them apart and we get to witness this first hand. Since the actors were newcomers at the time i was very impressed with their acting talent.Another good thing was the last 15 or 20 minutes which are the films highlight and its most scariest moments. i was really hooked by this point at what was happening.That was the good. Here is the bad.The film is too short. at 87 minutes it isn't nearly long enough. I felt there should've been so much more included. it's such a quick finish that i couldn't really take it all in.now, even though the film is pretty short it also tends to be pretty slow. like i said the last 15 or 20 minutes are its best but before this it seems like it takes forever to get started and sometimes it tends to drag and be a little boringI liked the acting but listening to 3 people yell and curse through almost the entire movie got a little annoying and at some moments that seemed to be the films only conflict. i liked how they showed that fear was consuming them but i wish they would've concentrated more on the legend.Now this is kinda my own personal gripe about the film. i lied the last 15 minutes but the actual ending itself was such a letdown. for that 20 minutes it created such a good intense build-up and all of a sudden it's over and you go ""that's it"". i know they were trying to be creative and make us wonder what happened to them without actually telling us but it just ends up being a letdown.another thing that hurt this film but also helped it was the hype that surrounded it. the hype made this film gross 140 million dollars but since there was such a demand that this film be the scariest thing we've ever seen and to some it simply wasn't and i think over-hyping a film can really hurt it sometimes and this is the case with this film.All and all it's creativity saves it from being a total disappointed and i do give it credit making a uge impact on the horror genre but i just wish it could've been better. 7/10",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Back to the roots,"Since there was no ""hype""in France and I don't listen to critics anyway, I saw this movie with no preconceptions other than the trailer. By the way, it must be the cheaper-made movie in recent history ! Instead of being innovative, it gave me the feeling of going back to the roots of horror with stories, not by Lovecraft, but Algernon Blackwood (""The Wendigo"") or Arthur Machen, who could convey this sense of unseen terror and dangerous landscapes. The idea seemed reminescent of the ""dogma"" movies and a series of mock-documentaries made by the French/German TV channel Arte, all showing false documentaries about abnormal events presented as the real thing - but giving the trick in the end to question the viewer's gullibility. (But the filmmakers of BWP can't have seen it, of course.) And the movie ? I thought the end was a bit of a let-down, but as a suspense story, it was quite gripping. Why all the hype ? Maybe because low-budget ground-breaking horror is an established tradition since NOTLD and there was nothing else around ?(Like ""Henry"", very overrated in my opinion.)

ONE OF THE MOST DISAPPOINTING FILMS I'VE EVER SEEN,"I watched the Blair Witch Project with a dozen other people, who also heard all the hype about this new horror flick and we were anticipating the big ""scary"" moment(s) to come.  Guess what? It never came.  Although the premise of the film is interesting...the film NEVER (at any point--except maybe the last two seconds of the film) lives up to its potential (you end up wondering why this movie even cost $60,000 to make).  One needs to have a lot of unmotivated imagination (or be down right gullible) to find any part of this movie scary.  The film is mostly comprised of the three characters arguing and fighting (the girl is especially annoying), them running around at night screaming (as if that's supposed to scare the viewers), sticks hanging on the trees and gathered stones, and of course the grand finale which leaves the viewers numb with utter disappointment.  Again, the premise of the movie has (or had) a lot of potential but it nowhere near lives up to its hype...It is one of the most (if not the) boring movies I've ever seen and a total waste of time and money...Our group was so bored after watching the ""Project"" that we ended up watching a video of the Matrix afterwards...A generous 1 (out of 10) for the Blair Witch Project",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Godfather of Found Footage,"I've had a 10 rating on this for years but never reviewed it. I've read some of the reviews on here and felt I had to step in. People who've actually just watched this for the first time (I find this crazy, have you been living on Mars?) have to realise that this is TWENTY THREE years old! If you've seen the likes of the Paranormal Activity franchise, Cloverfield, End Of Watch (3 different genre's there) then you have to thank the Blair Witch crew. If you've seen others but find this a bit lame then remember, those movies you're comparing this to, thank the Blair Witch crew. If you've ever enjoyed ANY Found Footage movies, thank the Blair Witch crew. It's simple in its premise, it blew the horror genre right up to peoples faces and ended what was a pretty lean decade for horror (90's) and kicked the 2000s into horror overdrive. If you weren't old enough to get totally hyped up because this ""major story"", which was all over the tv and the internet and was realistic enough for IMDb to have the 3 main characters listed that their whereabouts were ""unknown"" then you'll see it was a pretty huge stunt which pissed a good few people off. Even Roger Ebert has it down as 10/10 and he was always pretty damning on horror movies in general. This movie changed an entire industry and created thousands upon thousands of people's perception about making a story they'd written be brought to a cinema, vod and direct to sale.I'll end saying this. I guarantee there's at least one movie that you as an individual like that was inspired by the Blair Witch Project.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Scary? Yes. Scariest ever? No.,"Although I commend Haxan films for delivering a very original horror film to the big screen, I can't say that it was ""The scariest movie I've ever seen,"" as some of the other movie critics out there have claimed. Before you say it's because I've been jaded by the likes of Jason, Freddy Krueger, et. al., let me tell you that I saw the 1963 version of ""The Haunting"" last weekend and it had me more scared than this, and like this movie, it was used very little in the way of ""special effects."" Anyway, my recommendation is to see this movie because it is an interesting concept and for a few good edge-of-your-seat moments, but don't expect to be frightened witless.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It is beyond my understanding,"OK, the concept is great, I have to admit it. But, the movie is a total waste of time if you're looking to be scared, like many said. I am really not able to understand how many of my favorite critics rated this film 4 stars and up. I agree we cannot reduce any movie to only a number, but in this case I'm really perplexed. First of all, the characters are undoubtedly annoying! I didn't like them in any way. It just seemed they used the whole swearing thing to look more real, but it ended up sounding artificial and nothing more than that. Analyzing them, I noticed Heather was the more developed one, though she was the most irritating. Josh and Mike had no definite personality, they kept changing from nice guys to completely pugnacious. During the day shots, all I was hoping for was to get dark quick and perhaps feel a bit frightened. However, the scenes at tent were also boring where the listened to inaudible (for us) sounds and overreacted to pretty much everything.Even though, it's not anything like a good movie (in my opinion) I still encourage you to watch and draw your own conclusions.

"Often imitated, never equaled","I didn't see ""The Blair Witch Project"" in the theater. It's one of my movie regrets. I can only imagine how scary it must have been in the theater with an audience on the edge on their seats. It's scary enough in the living room. Somehow, with no budget to speak of, writers/directors/editors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez and company created a horror masterpiece. I don't want to sound like a movie snob but I do think that the more you know about filmmaking the more you appreciate what was accomplished with in this movie. No matter how many times I see this movie it still takes me a couple of days to shake off the last ten minutes. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a horror classic.

A very original scary movie,"I loved the concept of this movie: three filmmakers who intend to film a documentary and end up getting lost and tormented by the Blair Witch.  And the fact that the entire premise was made up is very cool.  The filmmakers of this movie were very clever in coming up with an idea that no one else has.  Unfortunately, many clones will probably result because of all of the success the movie has had.  All of the hype that surrounded this movie drove me to see it.  I am a big fan of scary movies and wanted to see what made this movie so different from the rest of the pack.  I appreciate the fright factor in the film.  The fact that there is no bad guy is a very different concept and a chilling one at that.  In all of the scary movies that I've seen there is a bad guy who invades your thoughts and you end up thinking about that night in your darkened bedroom.  But in this movie there was no bad guy... which seemed to me to be ten times scarier.  While I was watching the movie, I anticipated much more than was shown to me on the screen.  I kept waiting for something to happen... yet hardly anything did.  Here I can see why people did not like the movie.  The element of the movie is suspense, but in our society we are used to thrills and chills and immediate action.  The ending had my friends and me arguing for weeks.  Ambiguous endings can be good for a film.  In that way, you can put your own spin on what just happened on the screen.  When the movie ended, I was initially disappointed.  But this is one movie that gets under your skin with its unanswered questions.  You think about it more and more and wonder what really happened out there in the woods.  Overall, I enjoyed the movie for the most part.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Boring as hell,"It's a sad commentary on the state of film that people are willing to christen anything that is offbeat or different as the great white hope of the film industry.  This movie has made gobs and gobs of money, has probably made the people involved richer than they could possibly have imagined, but this is not the great movie that people want to believe it is.  It is extremely boring and depressingly unscary.  There is absolutely no excuse, in my mind, for the mind-bogglingly crappy way the film was shot...things are out of focus, it is jumpy, and much of the time the film is either completely dark or the shot is of trees or rocks while action is happening elsewhere.  I realize it is supposed to be a documentary shot by amateurs, but there is no reason to put the audience through that for some arty notion of what is ""realistic filmmaking"".  A 60,000 dollar budget doesn't mean you end up with ""Clerks"". Usually you end up with a crappy-looking film, which is exactly what the money bought here.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Dull and Annoying,"This movies tries to slowly build up the tension with the kids lost in the woods and vague hints that there might be something else out there too that's going to get them but it is a long time in before anything actually happens.This might work if the characters were sympathetic and compelling but actually they are whiny, annoying, pathetic brats. They have gone out walking in an area of woods that they don't know and not a one of them can even read a map. They start whingeing and moaning right from the beginning, far before there is even a hint of any malevolent presence. They just bumble around directionless and snivelling without making any plan or discussing any interpersonal relationships or history that could constitute plot, context or back-story.Frankly they are such terrible company to be in that you actually want them to die and the slow pace of the film just causes frustration when you find you are an hour in and they are still not dead yet.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Like an episode of the X-Files but less satisfying.,"The Blair Witch Project was an interesting film that had a very unique concept. The story was well conceived and the sheer reality of the filming effects helped to make it more believable. The acting was fine given the premise of how the directors operated (limited scripts and a lot of adlibbing)and the scariest movies are the ones that really make you think and disturb you for days afterward (which this one did). The shaky camera technique and the disappointment of never seeing much of anything kept the movie from being more enjoyable. I think even a glimpse of what they were seeing would have been sufficient. I view this film as being much like an episode of the X-Files, but not even as good as some of those. At least with the X-Files there's a payoff...and although things on that show are not often wrapped up in a tidy package that's easy for everyone to live with, there is a creepy chill that stays with you, makes you think and long to see more. I wanted to see what happened after the films were discovered and brought back to town. I wanted to see what was being shown and written on the Internet site that helped hype the movie.

Its all about what you don't see....,"Smash-hit independent horror film made quite an impression on the audiences of 1999 for good reason.Three student film makers go into the Maryland woods to make a documentary about a legendary witch. When they suddenly find themselves lost, they end-up becoming part of the legend themselves!Clever film is played out as a 'real' occurrence from beginning to end and frankly many viewers at the time thought it was indeed real footage shot by real missing students! Of course, it isn't, but it still went down as a landmark film of the decade. Although many people have mixed feelings about this movie, it's a unique film that pays off chillingly well for horror fans.This movie is all about mystery, atmosphere, and the unknown - all of which are themes that pay off well as the increasingly dark story unfolds. There's plenty of memorable moments to be had (the scene that pays homage to The Devil and Tom Walker is especially horrific) and it all builds to an intense climax that is truly eerie. The young stars (Donahue, Leonard, and Williams) are likable and sympathetic characters, even as their desperation drives them to anger and fear. The setting of the autumn wilderness is effectively unsettling, the old house used for the finale being particularly creepy.While some people laugh it off, which is a shame, this fan enjoys this film for it's sheer simplistic brilliance.

I was disappointed,"I seem to be mostly alone in this opinion, but this movie didn't frighten me much--it didn't make me feel much of anything.

I already knew that none of them would make it out alive (from the film tag line), so there was no suspense involved.  Only the last five minutes of the film gripped me.  Even then, the ending was hardly a surprise.On the positive side, it was a very creative idea, and I appreciated the absence of blood and violence.If it was not a particularly bad film, neither was it an exceptionally good one.

Authentic,"I've seen most (good) horror movies and become desensitised to most jumpscare fodder out there. However, Blair Witch remains authentically terrifying due to its unique constitution.As it was made from so little, with nobody actors abs no major studio behind it, no other film could recreate how real this feels, as the Hollywood lenses are stripped and the footage looks like something you could shoot at your local woods.This enhances the horror, as by being so grounded in reality, the anticipation of seeing the witch is so much higher as it feels more real, and therefore something that could exist in real life, only exacerbated by the richly cultiva d backstory.Every jerk of the camera, every noise, every sudden silence only raises the tension. The minimalism of the threats they do encounter only make it feel realer, as instead of flying broomsticks or things to be dismissed as fiction, the clues the witch leave behind remain supernatural enough yet also real enough to play on your mindThis is the first movie to scare me in a long time, remaining in my mind long after the final unforgettable frames.Best watched 12 at night in pitch black.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Fear of twigs and string,"1 THE SCAM Apparently there is a very scary film called ""The Blair Witch Project"". It is famous for the fact that, although it was made very cheaply using hand held video cameras and the like, it is really, really scary. In fact so scary that it is best to make sure you are wearing your brown trousers before entering the cinema. I thought I was going to see this film but my local cinema tricked me by showing a crap film of the same name which was so badly made that no one else would have been fooled by it. Also it was clearly a fake version as it had zero scares in it. In fact it wasn't a horror film at all but a very bad film made by art students mistaking noise for art who couldn't scare my cat, Xena, who is frightened of anything containing atoms.2 MY THEORY Urban youth in western countries no longer have any initiation rites or rites of passage. Very few of them even go camping anymore and most of them have little experience with things found in the natural world e.g. trees, leaves. Therefore the very idea of spending a night out in the woods fills them with existential dread and they find it easy to identify with the very unpleasant and very whiney stars of this film. Like the characters in the film they are terrified by the sight of a few twigs held together with bits of string or small mounds of rocks. It's sad I know but what other explanation could there be for fear engendered in some viewers of this film? For anyone who has ever spent a night out in the woods it will forever be a mystery why anyone should be prone to fear of twigs and rocks. All we can hope to do is reach out our hearts to those poor young folk living in daily dread of post traumatic twig disorder after seeing this film.3 THE ART OF THE UNSEEN I've always thought that The Haunting (original B&W Robert Wise version) to be the scariest film of all time and will brook no argument. In the proper version of The Haunting the viewer never sees what the horrible thing(s) are that hang out in Hill House but nevertheless the lack of gore and the feverish workings of the viewer's imagination supplied all that was necessary to scare the s**t out of said viewer. Presumably the makers of Blair Witch had the same idea. They failed. Miserably.4 THE ART OF NOISE Another superb feature of The Haunting was the dramatic use of sound to create a feeling of overwhelming terror. Had the Blair Witch makers attempted to engineer the soundtrack and sound effects more professionally I believe they could have turned a deeply s**t movie into one that was at least acceptably a bit prone to cause viewers to worry, a little. They didn't. Instead they opted for making the potentially scary noises inaudible and cranked up the sound of twigs rubbing together until they overpowered everything else on the soundtrack.5 HOW TO COPE WITH SEEING THIS FILM You may or may not be familiar with my dictum that all modern films would benefit from having half an hour cut from their running length. In the case of Blair Witch the film would benefit from having about 75 minutes cut out of its approximately 90 minute running time. In fact, if you are unwise enough to see the entire film you will come out of the cinema convinced that the film ran for at least 17 or 18 hours. In the interests of sanity I advise you to watch until you get to the end of the vox pop scenes and then head smartly for the nearest bar. Have a few good stiff drinks and return to the auditorium to see the last five minutes of the film. This features scenes inside an old house which are accidentally quite good. Then go home and hug a twig.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Good movie, but not great","The TBWP is a good movie, it has a simple story, very simple, but it is scary and mysterious, this movie has no ""screamers"" or some demon or witch, if you do not like that kind of scary movies, do not do it Do not look This, because it is horror for the situation, the sounds, the scared people and the things they found in the forest, not for the screamers or the spirit, it is up to you if they make this a good horror movie, because it is imagination, you can imagine a lot of horror or not imagine anything and try to scare yourself with the movie, if you are going to do the last one, you will say that this movie is bad, if you make the first one, the movie will like you or you will even love it, from my point of view, it is a good movie, but not great, everything is in the person who is watching the movie, the movie only sets the stage for fear, you will complete the horror ...As I said if you want psychological horror, look at this, and with high volume or headphones

Inventors of the Found Footage Horror,"I came into The Blair Witch Project without expecting much and came out of it quite satisfied; the film was everything I hoped it would be. Modern day internet horror has spoiled me and my taste for good scares and everyone has Blair Witch to thank for that. This movie started a new generation of horror movies, going from the 80's/90s slasher blockbuster to this new found footage format. But no movies that followed the trend really did Blair Witch any justice.Now I want to explain what this film really is. It doesn't have jump scares, the antagonist isn't a monster or a typical Jason-Krueger-Predator slasher, we don't even see the 'supposed' witch or even anything supernatural, and it's horror relies on sound, disturbing visuals, the script, and the actor's performances to sell the situation. Everything that just so happens to absolutely make me defecate in my pants. This movie does everything perfectly and it's influence can be seen everywhere because of it.This movie is criticized for it's low budget, short runtime, poor acting, and anti-climactic ending. I can't stress enough how wrong that idea is. This movie dared to be different and it pays off greatly. The acting isn't supposed to be dramatic, it's supposed to feel real, which it does astoundingly. The low budget contributes immensely to the fear of the unknown and conceals details that would otherwise make the film less mysterious and scary. It isn't a cryptic film either, it's plot is quite sensible, and it's length leaves you wanting more without boring the audience.It never explains the events that unfold, it never shows you who's behind the curtain, nothing is explicitly supernatural or impossible, I could even believe it was real if it were on LiveLeak instead of theaters. This all makes The Blair Witch Project one of the greatest horror films ever. Revolutionary and effective in every way. Just watch it if you haven't already.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

So the viral marketing worked well getting people into the theaters, but it really divided audiences.

Disappointed,"0.55 am Leeds, England. Just finished watching THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. It's not on general release here yet, but hey, I'd heard about the film, and got chance to see it on video. Yes, it's different, yes it has suspense. Generally though there is no substance and no decent 'events' within the film. The premise alone may negate the requirement for graphic or typical plot devixes, but you have to question the validity of a film that seeks to exist on a fictional authentic-esque documentary film style but neither shocks, revolts or disturbs to any degree whatsoever. It was though a change not to have familiar predictable shock scenes, over the top mutilation or typical actors, film grade and of course artificial/background soundtrack. As a concept it could run. However, with no plot, it plods. And although the ending was necessarily weird, it just reminded me of the ending of Monty Python's Holy Grail.

"Unsettling, and devastatingly creepy.","Every time I tell someone my age (15) that I thought this movie was truly scary, they laugh at me, and they tell me how boring they thought it was. they never fail to mention how awful it was that it had NO violence, and showed NOTHING scary or sexual. Just try to put yourself in the character's situation. You'd panic and lose your mind too.The movie consists of the ""real"" footage that was ""found"" in the woods, that involved three college students, Heather, Mike, and Josh, filming a documentary about a local legend known as the Blair Witch. First they interviewed several people. Then they headed out into the woods. When they got there, they lost the map, started freaking out, and everything went downhill from there. They found, and heard a lot of evidence that the Blair Witch might be out there. Soon, they realized they were being stalked by something, but they already became hopelessly lost, and scared. Soon, the camera fell over, and they disappeared.This movie is actually truly scary. Not because it shows jump-out surprises, or shocks, but the behavior of the characters is what's scary. ""How can you be scared by people being scared?"" said one comment. The answer is that it's not them being scared that scares us. It's the thought of what they're scared of. You never know what could be out there, and there's no way of finding out (the sequel ruined this). The movie was set up as a publicity stunt, and became an internet phenomenon. This movie cheesed off many film goers who were expecting to see a horror movie in the style of the ""Scream"" movies. I praise everyone who understands the greatness of this movie.By the way, the movie is very, very scary. When I saw it, I knew I would be disturbed, but this movie shattered my spirits for many months because it was so scary to me.

Good try... but not quite.,"I'll admit.  Horror movies are not my thing in general. Growing up I cut my teeth on H.P.

I think that the acting was well done, and the basic idea was good (others here have given examples showing it's hardly a new idea, however). This was hardly a terrifying movie, though. Creepy? Sure. Spooky? You bet. Good movie making? Perhaps. Out and out scary? Sorry.  I've spent a lot of time camping in some very out of the way places in the Appalachians, and I've seen some, to put it frankly, some ""whacked out s**t"" there.

Worst movie ever?,"""Blair Witch"" is one of those movies that either lives or dies on whether or not you're really, really scared of the things that go bump in the night. If rocks banging around, bundles of twigs hanging in trees, and unknown voices in the night are what freak you out, then maybe you really will be scared by what's happening here.  Still, the whole ""the most terrifying thing to the human mind is the unknown"" is a little overplayed here, to say the least.  Hey, even in ""Jaws"" we eventually got to see the shark.  This thing was made on a shoestring budget and it shows.  Why did they even bother to use 16mm when the best parts are on video?  Anyhow, blah, blah, blah, get ready for a disappointment, folks.  This thing probably would make a good five-minute campfire story, but for crying out loud, why make something that goes on for so long but, like our heroes, really doesn't go much of anywhere by the end?Having said this, sure, most of you are going to go see this movie anyhow.

Most creepy and disturbing movie I've ever seen. This movie is the reason why I hate horror movies.,"I watched ""The Blair Witch Project"" in 2000 when I was about 9 years old with my older cousins and I remember I was in the room with them, because I thought it was just another documentary on Discovery Channel. I really believed everything I was seeing was true. Just imagine the impact that this movie made in my mind at that time. Those final minutes of ""The Blair Witch Project"" was the truly hell and nightmare on screen. I had never experienced that feeling of dread before. After I understood it was just a movie, but by then it was late. The scenes and disturbing sounds stuck in my mind for weeks and I take weeks sleeping with the light on to recover. I grew up with the certainty that I'm not a fan of horror movies.Every horror fan is naturally a masochist. It's the pure masochism to love being scared and distressed for hours, days and even weeks. This is not my case, so I always avoid to watch this film genre. But I need to give ten stars for Blair Witch, because this movie really was able to mess with my most instinctive fears without show in no time the witch's face, or whatever the hell was that thing that was chasing those adolescents. This movie was creepy because the fear that it brings is the fear of the dark, fear of being lost walking in circles, fear of unknown sounds at night. That alone is scary enough, but there was also the growing fear of someone or something is stalking you and that there is no escape. Today I think the most brilliant thing is that the movie does not deliver anything ready for you. The plot just forces you to imagine what really happened to the three teenagers - and every possibility is more sinister and darkness than the other. Thinking better, there are certain things that are better not be seen. No doubt, the most disturbing and creepy movie I've ever seen. Well, I'll never see it a second time, but if you are a horror fan, mainly psychological, then this movie is for you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Minimalist filmmaking that captured the audience of 1999 and became a sleeper hit, Blair Witch Project is the prototype for Found Footage horror","In October 1994, three film students, Heather (Heather Donahue), Joshua (Joshua Leonard), and Mike (Michael C. Williams) traveled into the surrounding woods of Burkittsville, Maryland (formerly know as Blair) to document the legends surround the Blair Witch that haunts the woods. However the three were never seen again and only the footage was recovered detailing their journey through the woods.Blair Witch is a 1999 found footage horror film directed and produced by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez who'd been inspired to make the film after finding documentaries on paranormal events scarier than traditional horror films. Forming Haxan films with various other colleagues, the film was shot in 1997 with only a 35 page script while the majority of the film would be based on improvisation. Artisan Entertainment Bought the film for $1.1 million following its success at Sundance Film Festival, and Artisan in one of the first major acts of using the internet as a marketing tool for a film positioned the film as a sleeper hit by playing up the ""realness"" of the film including printing missing persons posters of the actual actors and IMDb even listed the three as ""Missing presumed dead"". Thanks to strong critical praise and savvy marketing techniques the film became a monster hit earning $140 million in the United States alone and $248 million worldwide. Audience reception has been more divisive as many dislike the film's loose structure and handheld camera work while others praise it as a horror classic. I myself fall somewhere in the middle where I admire the film's simplified low frills take on the horror genre, but this isn't a movie I revisit all that often.For me the best part of the movie is in the opening 20 minutes where Heather, Josh, and Mike are going around Burkittsville and asking locals about the legend of the Blair Witch. I honestly found the people in the town so interesting and quirky with their ""on the ground"" knowledge of the urban legend surrounding their town and their banter between each other did lend itself to some legitimately humorous moments that made their stories of murder and unexplained disappearances seem more real as they described them. Honestly had this film been a mockumentary of simply interviewing these eccentric residents, that alone would've been enough to sustain this movie. But of course this is a horror film and as we all know horror films are based on isolation either through social constructs or physical isolation so the movie is predominantly set in the surrounding woods with Heather, Josh, and Mike going into the woods to find a cemetery linked to the Blair Witch for their documentary but ending up getting lost. I will say that the fact the actors improvised their interactions in the last two thirds of the movie is impressive and the slow descent into insanity as they find themselves lost in the woods unable to get out is a solid concept, but I never found our three characters all that interesting as they're just generic twentysomethings who are supposed to be average ordinary people, but they're not all that much to them other than buildup of petty annoyances. Once we get to weird stuff happening like weird stone piles appearing around their tents or creepy dolls and totems made of sticks showing up in the woods they do fine reacting to them, but I didn't really care about them all that much because I didn't feel like I knew them all that well.While The Blair Witch Project didn't invent Found Footage as prior films such as Cannibal Holocaust had dabbled with the format as far back as the 70s, Blair Witch served as a blueprint for future films in the format including the endearing Paranormal Activity films. While I appreciate the legend the film builds up around the Blair Witch especially with the opening 20 minutes as well as what it accomplishes with minimal resources, our three leads aren't all that interesting or memorable leading to their descent into madness lacking as much punch as the movie wants it to. It's an impressive work on its own merits, but hardly the classic it was hailed as at the time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Creative and original idea not to be mimicked,"Brilliant idea:  a movie so realistic it's *real* until you know for sure that it's not.  The makers of this film went to so much trouble, in fact, to make it seem real, that even given that I knew it was just a movie, I had to reconvince myself it wasn't real after viewing the film and checking out the web site.  To be sure:  it's nice to believe it's real if you want to get really, really scared.  As a movie, though?  Mediocre.  They could have done more with the legend to build up the plot, without taking away from the ""real"" aspect one bit.  The footage they include doesn't include enough interviews or background to be pieced into a true documentary anyway.  I wasn't quite as afraid as I wanted to be, in all honesty.  If people try to copy this idea, however, they will FAIL.  This is the type of thing that can only be done once successfully.  I don't want to be going to a bunch of scary home movies and getting headaches all over the place every summer.  I recommend seeing this movie solely on its creativity, though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Did I see the right movie?,"First of all, let me say I DID enjoy this movie.  It was very clever, well acted, and quite creepy at times.  That said, I don't think I have ever looked so forward to a movie and been so disappointed. I can't believe that this was the movie that everyone has said is the scariest movie ever made, they are still having nightmares, can't walk in the woods in broad daylight, etc. I went expecting to be scared out of my wits. I made my husband go with me, I was so scared beforehand. (I am actually scared quite easily.) There was no need--I could've watched this alone, at midnight.  Like I said, I did like the movie.  I just don't understand what is supposed to be so terrifying about it. It was a really clever concept and was actually quite enjoyable.  And mind you, the things in the trees, the bundles of sticks, and the end (although very ambiguous)were really creepy. But people actually think this is scarier than ""The Exorcist""?  Please.

Start of an era,"In the late 90's 'The Blair Witch Project' kickstarted the 'found footage' sub genre.Although a brilliant concept I felt the film itself never really lived up to the hype but to be fair, there was so much hype at the time that would have been almost impossible.For movies buffs though it's a really interesting look at the film that brought 'found footage' into the mainstream and will forever have a place in cinematic history.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Fun and determined to scare you, or else...","I enjoyed the film as a whole and definitely felt the pull of despair that slowly swelled up out of the actors as time went on. This film had the uncanny knack of being able to keep you emotionally paced with the events at hand. Nothing particularly jumped out and scared me during it, but I was definitely feeling the uneasiness of the characters situation and that uneasiness rose with the characters as the film progressed. I don't think that this film corrects what has been going wrong with horror films over the last 20 years (i.e.: too many FX, not letting the audience imagine anything) but it is a good step in the right direction. The actors are uncanny in how believable they are and how they react to what is a formidable situation. Lost, inexperienced, hungry, in the throes of a nicotine fit and unaware of how each person in the group reacts to stress and the unknown or unseen. This film could be used to illuminate how humans deal with the unknown and fear. The fear, like I said, doesn't jump out and bite you....it simply puts you in its mouth and slowly swirls you around. Next thing you know you are nearly a participant, and you really don't want to be. Good film...hope this isn't a flash in the pan for these guys. Wake up Hollywood.

The Perfect Film,"The Blair Witch Project borrows from horror classics like F.W Murnau's Nosferatu and Michael Powell's Peeping Tom in rendering us helpless victims to an almost faceless entity and combines this sensation with the viscerality of Roman Polanski's Repulsion - but this time we have left the apartment and ventured into the woods with nothing but a map, a compass and a few bad words. Undoubtedly inspiring to all, but sincerely not for everyone, the film is more than a horror film as it is barren of all gimmick and a real trail-blazer of the ""found-footage"" genre, the characters are so raw and believable that the audience almost feels unified with them in fleeing from something so frightening that it can't be felt or conquered, just simply acknowledged.

Unsettling found footage classic,"If you love found footage, you'll probably like this movie. I found it eerie and unsettling, the feeling you get when you hear something strange in the woods while camping. Some may not like this movie, because yes, it is a bit slow. However, I think it was executed perfectly and gave the audience the experience they intended to. The story of the making of this film made the movie even more scary.

One of the creepiest movies I've seen in a while,"The only real complaint I have about this movie is that there wasn't enough background. On the web site, in various specials, etc., an entire history of the Blair Witch is given that is left out of the movie. I think it would've helped if they built up the background story a little more.That said, this isn't the scariest movie I've ever seen, but it ranks pretty high up there. And when I say ""scary,"" I mean that in the sense that a very tense, uneasy atmosphere is maintained throughout the whole film (well, once they get lost, at least). You know you're never going to see the ""monster"" like in most horror movies, but the mystery just adds to the chills. If you think movies like ""The Exorcist,"" ""Alien,"" or ""The Shining"" are good, you should like this. If you have no imagination, then this isn't for you.In the words of H.P.

Hype Hurts a Decent But Unspectacular Film,"I applaud the unique, un-cliche-ridden approach that the filmmakers took with their ""Blair Witch Project"".  It is very refreshing to see a horror film that doesn't breakdown into all the predictable and ridiculous situations (""Don't back into that dark room alone!!"")  There is nothing particularly ORIGINAL about ""Blar Witch"", although it is an unusual approach and one that is rarely done, let alone done well.However, the hype surrounding this movie leaves me baffled.  For one, it really hurt to know certain details beforehand (these details have been crammed down our throats via TV and radio for a month or so, now).  There are so few points in the movie where something creepy actually happens, that to know of them before the lights have even gone down strips them of any eeriness.  But more than that, it created expectations for this film which were unrealistic.  Is it a good film?  Yes, if you can technically call it a ""film"".  Is it a GREAT film?

Great little film wasted on general public.,"I really loved this film, but felt like someone had cast pearls before the swine when I saw this at my local cineplex.

Please, if you don't like documentary style films, or if you have to be bombarded with special effects and gore to have a good time at the movies; do everyone a favor and stay home! This is a nice little intimate film that will crawl up your spine and into your head if you let it. In between the times I was yelling at people to shut up, I was genuinely spooked by this movie. I think all of the hype about the film has drawn in a lot of viewers who are expecting something else. This movie doesn't force itself upon you, it will only scare you if a allow it to.

"It's not what you see that's scary, it's what you DON'T see.","Despite what some people say, slasher movies can deliver quite a jolt.  It always gives a slight pulse-quickening when Jason drives a machete into his first victim.  But for that extended grab-the-armrest-until-your-knuckles-turn-white fear, only three different themes do that for me: religious-based horror, clowns (don't ask), and dread, the feeling that things aren't right and the cause of it is just out of reach, but coming closer.  All the best frighteners did it, from the two notes on the cello to denote the appearance of Jaws, to the silhouette of Ma Bates stalking up the stairs, to the wry grin of Vincent Price, to HAL telling his superior that he ""can't do that, Dave"".  The latest addition to this is The Blair Witch Project, which does it so well that almost half the audience I saw it with had difficulty breathing.The movie is shown as a documentary showing three film students, Heather, Josh, and Mike, preparing a documentary on a local legend known as the Blair Witch.  They film their documentary, but also videotape their experiences, too.  After interviewing a few locals, they learn, with the audience, that there was a disappearance of some children back in the 1940s in the woods surrounding the town, and that people have mysteriously dying all the way back for 300 years.  They then go out into the woods to film some scenes at different sites of the killings, and during this time, they describe the design of twigs that would accompany the killings.  Starting on the second day, they realize that they are lost and when they camp down for the night, they begin to hear voices and disturbances, and when they wake the next morning, they find three rock formations outside their tent.  Josh and Mike begin to blame Heather for getting them lost, since she was the one who put the whole thing together, and never bothered to scout the area first.  After the third night, they change from being a little worried to completely terrified.  They frantically try to backtrack out of the woods, until they realize how lost they are....First of all, I have to give kudos to the plot.  Documentaries in documentaries have been done before, but it works very well here, as they are still taping themselves in hope that if they don't make it out alive, at least their film will.  The premise of a local legend as the backdrop serves as an overarching fear.  Many areas have that urban or backwoods legend like the Jersey Devil, and this will remind anyone who has ever went into the woods as a youth and tried to find the truth in the rumors.  The whole trick is, you never actually see it, you just see what possibly is the outcome. The use of a simple black & white camera and a camcorder only heightens the worry, with the lower technology reinforcing the idea of just regular people.  There is a scene near the end when Heather holds the camera up to her face and apologizes to Mike's, Josh's, and her parents as she is so overcome by terror she can't speak without crying hysterically and running her nose.  The three of them show real fear as they face their own doom, and you can't help but feel slightly voyeuristic watching this.The main question of movie is if this is real or not, so if this is pressing you, stick around for the end of the credits.  This movie draws on the most primal fears we all have: the unknown, the things you can't explain, and the things that go bump in the night.  Not seeing what is happening is what creates that feeling of dread.  It's the watching of things unfolding and the anticipation that delivers the fear, i.e. the hunt being much more visceral than the actual kill.  This delivers one hell of a scare and considering the lack of true horror movies of this decade, I would rank this up there with Jacob's Ladder and It (the whole clown thing) as the best fright-inducers of the decade.  It's biggest flaw might be word-of-mouth hype, because if you don't allow yourself to taken into a horror movie as a viewer, then nothing would scare you.  I also had to ask myself why would they bother to keep taping if they thought they were in such mortal danger, but obviously, the movie would fall apart if this aspect is noted.  I rate this a 7 out of 10, (definitely worth the price of admission) because this is a great original concept executed with great results, not perfect, and it is certainly not the scariest movie ever made, but it does sparkle.  This is a movie to see if you want to get a real pit in your stomach, and if you let it, it will.  After seeing this, you might think twice before going out in the woods ever again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Best horror is the one left to imagination.,"The Blair Witch Project is an unconventionally good movie. Reason why so many hate it is because it's not exactly what's fed to us in this genre with haunted homes, bathtub scenes, exorcisms or occult. The film simply plays with your mind as it leaves the horror upto your imagination. That's what is special about this movie. What makes haunted creepy is the sheer imagination the mind conceives of it and you can't really put your finger on it. Just when fear is reduced to an evil physical entity it loses it charm ( like in the Conjuring 2 where an entity of the Nun with scary makeup haunts and even chases the lead). Physical manifestation of an evil being not only limits it's impact but also mars the aura of fear quotient. Nothing is left to the imagination. In the Blair witch project one never sees the witch or what really is behind the disappearances, there's no actual ending to the movie or the evil in it. But there's something in the woods and it's creepy and it stays there.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Even though it's short, some of my fellow theater-goers were bored after an hour and laughed at times when the tension should have been getting thicker.

Time to set the record straight,"Let's be honest, anybody who likes horror and didn't watch this film within its first two weeks in theaters likely has heard hype about this movie in some sense. I was no exception to this rule, and as I watched this film for the first time yesterday, and hadn't even existed when it was released, this film had twenty years of hype and expectations to meet for me. And while it is 100% true that hype will destroy a movie if too excessive, I must admit I can't say this film was hit by it too much. There are two problems that can befall upon older classic movies. One: either they become culturally irrelevant or made obsolete newer films (or to a lesser extent politically incorrect, like with ""gone with the wind"")(though I digress I still like that film), in story(for instance, a superhero movie from the forties will doubtfully get picked over a modern superhero film by someone) . Or two, the film becomes so old it is almost a foreign experience to watch (the technology, language, etc). To my knowledge, this film is very good at avoiding both problems. It is a very simple story, about kids lost in the woods, and possibly getting stalked by a witch, so it cleverly avoids problem one by by not having any added baggage to it's story and making what it DOES have in the story very good. And two, since the film is almost all in the woods, it's hard to find much technology to be confused by and the language is simple so it's not confusing either. Now admittedly it is ""filmed"" on old school cameras, which is admittedly a pretty big part of the movie, that being, the ""found footage"" aesthetic. But it would take two seconds to explain the cameras to someone else, so I don't find it a huge problem. Now that that's out of the way, let's get on to the actual movie. It's simplicity is it's biggest strength, and the camera grain adds another layer of fright to the movie. It has fantastic performances all around, and while a second viewing will not be nearly as frightening, it makes a very effective one-time horror film. One thing I must admit though, is that we never actually see the Blair witch. Now originally there was supposed to be a silhouette of her present in one of the scenes, but the camera angle didn't show her, and for reasons unknown to me, they never reshot the scene. While in some cases seeing the monster can be a downer or would lessen the film, with something like ""the Blair witch project"", I think it would've benefited from seeing her in some way. I don't mean like a full reveal, but a shadow, or a silhouette or a hand, just something to give the characters fears some legitimacy, would've been beneficial to the movie. Other than that, it's a good movie, and while not exactly enjoyable to watch because of how depressing and mean spirited it is, it's well made and was deserving of its praise.

I have seen it 3 times!!! Still terrifying!!!!,"I have seen this movie 3 times and i still believe that it is excellent. I have read most of the reviews of the film here, and most are positive, but the some of the negative ones bother me. I truly believe that they are missing the point! I have to agree that the film has been hyped too much, but at least the movie is worthy.( remember GODZILLA?). I saw the movie before the hype so I can't be accussed of being influenced by the hype. The average American moviegoer is lazy, unwilling to be challenged by a film. People today want to be wowed by special effects they dont want to use their imagination. That is what Blair Witch does, it chllenges the viewer to use his/her imagination. I love a good hollywood blockbuster as much as anyone, but they have become so  commonplace that they are not as good as they used to be. The Blair Witch Project proves that at times, less is more. What the audience doesnt see is scarier than what they do see. I can give a perfect example: in Jaws the movie was more effective whaen youm couldnt see the shark, right? The same has been implemented here.I went to see The Haunting the other day, I hated it, good production values and thats it! No sense of real fear! After the movier ended i listened to people's reaction to it, most liked it! Im amzed, the movie had a stupid story, terrible acting, nothing memorable, but the people only talked about the effects! True some of the effects were good but cmon, The Haunting doesnt hold a candle to BW! People now seem to rate a movie solely on the SFX, that is sad.The point is The Blair Witch is an example of good planning and genuine desire to scare. The performances are incredibly real, especially Heather's. Her scene alone late in the film should earn her an Oscar nod! But Im sure that the snobs in the Academy won't recognize that it is a great performance considering the kind of film The Blair Witch is. Like any movie TBW may not be everyone's cup of tea, but some of the comments im reading are just ridiculous!YES! The website was a clever way to raise interest in the film! YES! THe marketing for the film is aggressive!

A uniquely done classic!,"When my wife first approached me with the idea of going to see a film called ""The Blair Witch Project"",my immediate thought was,""The Blair what???"".I heard nothing of this movie,no advertisements or anything,prior to going to the theater,so naturally I was skeptical.Normally,when I have a premonition that a film is going to be horribly bad,9 times out of 10,it turns out to be right.This time,however,I was pleasantly surprised. What we have here is a very uniquely done classic horror film that I think we can safely place in the same ranks as ""Night of the Living Dead""(the original '68 classic).Just look at the similarities;Both were very cheaply done with a practically unknown cast.Most of the people I have spoken with about this movie either love it a lot,or hate it a lot,but one thing I look for in a good movie is uniqueness,and this movie definitely has it. Most of the people who like this movie are probably under the age of 20,but this is one 36 year old who loves ""The Blair Witch Project"" enough to have it in his video collection.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Watching this is a Complete and Utter waste of part of your life,"I cannot understand how anyone can like this film and actually be scared by it.  It is pure and unadulterated trash.  I was waiting and waiting for something to actually happen and when the credits came up I felt cheated. I was recently persuaded to watch Blair Witch 2 and it is 200% better that the first but it is still pants.  If there is a third, I for one will not watch it.0/10",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Crapola to the max,"Can't say enough bad things about this piece of garbage. And how in the world did anyone think it was scary. Explain one scary part, any. I've made tons of videos and none were as shaky as this, its like they did it on purpose. Girl was a annoying Yenta, the guys were o.k. but nothing great acting wise. Supposedly this was a rip off of the film, The Last Broadcast. Saw it also, equally bad. Both plots sounded cool, with broadcast involving the Jersey Devil. Somebody should redo either of these and make it work this time.

The Blair Witch has set a precedence for this type of genre that was fun and enjoyable to watch.,"Heather Donahue decides to do a documentary about the urban legend of The Blair Witch. She takes along two other film students, Joshua Leonard and Michael C. Williams, who are just as eager to do the project as she is. Their trip was planned to go to Maryland, interview some townsfolk, film some of the historic sites in the woods and return home. A year later their camera footage was found.Directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez decided to break away from the traditional cinematography and go with a first person view of the events that take place. We actually watch the majority of the movie through Heather Donahue's eyes. It was pretty creative and went well with the story and the actors.The Blair Witch is really a feeling movie. You have to pay a lot of attention to the film and really get into the mood the scenery and actors are trying to set. There isn't any monsters, no ghosts and no gore to be seen. You have to use your imagination and focus on the feelings of the actors.Heather Donahue and the rest of the crew do some great acting to suck you in and make you really feel like you are there scared for your life right along with them. The story kinda stalls towards the end as it seemed like they added some scenes in to make the movie longer but not noticeable on your first watch through.The Blair Witch has set a precedence for this type of genre that was fun and enjoyable to watch. I recommend The Blair Witch to any fan and look forward to more movies of this genre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the scarriest films ever,"This film is not like those usual killer with weapon slasher movies in which everyone in the theater screams when something scary happens.  This is the type of film where you watch the proceedings and are so afraid when you leave the theater you feel paralized.  Why, because this film is so realistic, it looks like this is actually the footage found in Maryland. But no, it isn't, and that is what makes Eduardo Sanchez and Dan Myrick such good directors.  They just give the cameras to the cast and let them run rampant. This film shows what happens when 3 student film-makers (Heather Donahue is excellent in the best female lead of the year, Michael Williams is convincing as a scarred and insane sound man, and Joshua Leonard is exceptional as a mad cameraman) who get lost in the woods of Burkittsville, Maryland.  What follows is scarrier than anything I've seen in a really long time, and it is enjoyable (especially in the dark).  One of the best films of the year.  A++",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A unique study in terror that requires a little something from the viewer.,"I really wanted to love ""The Blair Witch Project"" when I went to see it at the cinemas. I'd read the Internet hype after it came out in the U.S. back when not everyone realized it was fake. The reviews called it ""the scariest movie since the Exorcist!"" and stories of people screaming and crying in the cinemas really brought my expectations up to an unattainable height. I'd talked it up to myself as well as to friends and colleagues, telling them all that they had to go see it when it came out. But by the time it actually hit our shores (I'm an Aussie), everyone had been made aware that it was fake and all the magic of early reports had been replaced by negativity and mocking. But I lined up, paid my cash and went in to find out what it was all about.I must admit, that first sitting was the epitome of disappointment. The camera jumped all over the place and made me feel frustrated and a tad ill. The constant fighting of the characters got on my nerves more than a reality TV show. But the worst part of it was that I didn't find it at all to be scary. Here was this so-called holy grail of scary movies and people were actually laughing in the cinema rather than screaming. I walked out feeling completely let down after months of looking forward to the event.A couple of years later I decided to watch the movie on DVD. I picked a cold, dark night, turned all the lights out, took the phone off the hook and sat down on the couch. I'd made the decision that I was going to watch ""The Blair Witch Project"" the way the first viewers had seen it. Forgetting everything I'd ever heard about it, I would delve into it with a clean slate. I'm really glad I did! While I didn't completely freak out and lose my lunch in fear, I certainly found a new appreciation for it. In fact, if the viewer simply allows themselves to become involved in the situation on screen, it can become quite psychologically jarring. I really believe one of the reasons that so many hated the film, myself included, was due to both expectations and an inability to actually put themselves in the place of the actors. To actually experience the movie! It certainly didn't help that the audience I saw it with was laughing. If you can take that step, then ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a very effective and clever film. So the question is, is it OK to ask the audience to commit so much of themselves to a film for them to be able to have an emotional reaction (other than boredom). The more I think about it, the more I think the answer is yes. The problem has been created over an extended period of time, with more and more blockbuster movies that require nothing of the audience whatsoever. No thought, no belief, no experiencenothing! That being the case, when a movie such as this one comes around, it's understandable that people may just find it boring as they have lost the ability to actually ""experience"" it or in some cases, simply choose not to let themselves.No, I haven't done a complete turn around and gone from a Blair Witch basher to a Blair Witch lover. It's not a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination. The epileptic camera movements still make it hard to watch, the inability to hear what's going on in the forest and some of the bickering still gets on my nerves. But I must admit it all makes it far more realistic and it's all very intentional to get the desired effect. The acting is actually pretty damn good. The fact is that in all likeliness, normal people would fight and cry and scream and carry on exactly the same way these guys do. There are moments of absolute terror in their voices and sheer emotion on their faces which is a credit to the actors. I can't say there's anything I could suggest they should have done differently that would make it any more realistic than it is and for that reason alone I consider the movie to be a success. It is a movie to be experienced alone in the dark though. Nothing else would do it justice.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A waste of time and money,"This movie has the quality of a home video. It tries being special and fails. If you watch it in a cinema the only feeling you will have is sickness due to the uncontrolled movement of the camera. I was nearly bored to death and waited desperately for the film to end.

I love you ..."" and ""We are US citizens, they cannot do this to us"" (or something similar).",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Genuinely creeped me out,"I'm a huge fan of horror films and I've always been fascinated with found footage movies even though the ones I saw were pretty bad. The Blair Witch Project, on the other hand, is one of the best found footage films I've seen.The Blair Witch Project tells the story of three teenagers who disappear in the woods whilst making a documentary on the urban legend known as the Blair Witch.I really wish I saw this film when it came out. It was such a huge deal in 1999 and so many people believed everything that happened in the film was real and I can see why. Unlike a lot of modern found footage flicks, The Blair Witch Project stand out to me by how much thought and care went into its presentation to make it seem as authentic as possible. The low quality footage from the camera, casting non actors and the overall low budget of the film made it incredibly convincing that these three teens actually went missing. The three actors in the movie were fantastic especially considering this was their first film. Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard were very believable in their roles and most of their conversations being improvised helped sell the fact what I was watching was real.A major complaint about this film was how it wasn't scary at all or nothing really happened which I totally understand but personally, I felt this growing tension building as the film went on. I loved the way everything started to slowly spiral and the actors got more and more agitated with one another. Despite nothing much happening, all the strange stuff that does happen kept me feeling tense and worried for the characters and, with every night, things got progressively creepier which led to an unsettling climax that genuinely freaked me out due to the brilliant camerawork and performances.I have to give praise to Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez. They came up with such a simple idea that required a really low budget and managed to inspire and popularise the found footage genre. Each element was carefully thought out to make it seem as real as possible and, in my eyes, I believe they succeeded.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Worst camera work i have ever seen,I know camera work isn't the most important thing on a motion picture but i care a whole lot about it.

A Witches Brew,"(+SPOILERS+) Modern day horror story about a trio of college students Heather Donahue Michael Williams and Josh Leonard going into the woods outside of Burkittsville Maryland in October 1994 to do a documentary on the ""Blair Witch"". A ghost that has haunted those woods since the founding of the town of Burkittsville in 1810.Supposedly desecrating an old Indian cemetery in the in the area by building the town there it's felt by the people who live in and around Burkittsville that the ""Blair Witch"" is responsible for a number of vicious and unexplained murders. The string of killings started in the late 1800's when five hunters were brutally murdered by the stream at Coffin Rock. The killings continued on intermittently up until the winter of 1940-41 with the murder of seven children at the old man Parr house. The children who were still alive were made to stand in a corner and wait their turn, looking at an empty wall, in order not to see Parr murdered the others. Parr was found to be insane but the people of the town feel that he was possessed by the ""Blair Witch"".The three students drive out into the woods with their van and then take their video and living equipment in backpacks and go hiking out into the eerie forest. Nothing at first really happens to them until they pass by the haunted Coffin Rock. After a nights sleep in their tent the hikers find themselves in what is an old Indian cemetery with a number of rock piles as tombstones all around them. On their way back to their parked van the next night they hear strange noises all around their camp site and when they wake up the next morning they see the rock piles outside as if they were following them. Things become very weird where the three seem to be going around in circles and even worse Mike for some reason throws away the map that Heather had to help them find their way out of the woods.After another harrowing night in the forest the hikers find themselves in an area of the woods with Voodoo like symbols and artifacts all over the trees! Panic starts to set in on the three hikers with Josh, not being able to take it anymore, going crazy and running out into the woods away from the other two hikers. Heather and Mike searching the woods, trying to find Josh, later that night hear faint cries coming from what turns out to be an old abandon house,The old Parr house?,in the woods. Mike going in first goes room to room trying to find Josh and finally realizes that the cries are coming from the basement and runs down there, just as the cries started they all of a sudden stop.Heather screaming for Mike and Josh to answer her also runs down to the basement and then all we see from her video camera is Mike standing in the corner looking into a blank wall, like the children who were killed at the old man Parr house some sixty years ago! Terrified with fear we hear Heather give out an ear splitting cry and the camera falls out of her hand! All we can see from what the video camera recorded is an empty ceiling! Heather Mike and Josh were never seen or heard from again and all that was left of them was the video tapes that they made of their expedition in the woods that made up the movie ""The Blair Witch Project"".""The Blair Witch Project"" is a lot like the movies directed by the late Jacques Tourneur like ""Cat People"" in 1942 and ""The Leopard Man"" in 1943 and later ""The Curse of the Demon"" in 1957. Tourneur used lights and sounds and shadows to scare the wits out of his audiences not special effects that were so used to seeing in horror movies now.The the film has over 3,000 IMDb users comment on it as well as taking in over $140 million in domestic ticket sales during it initial release in the summer of 1999 shows the tremendous effect that it had on those who saw it. These two facts, among many others, shows that ""The Blair Witch Project"" made an impact on the movie going public far bigger than many of it's detractors would like us to believe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Holds up well,"Compelling and eerie found footage movie about a trio of amateur filmmakers who disappear after hiking into the Maryland woods to shoot a documentary about the legend of the Blair Witch. A modern classic that helped usher in that particular subgenre of horror we have today. Most found footage movies are absolutely terrible and can't hold a candle to this one. It's probably the only movie of its type that ever seemed remotely authentic to me, even though I knew it was all fiction. At the time, people debated whether or not this was actually real. That seems silly, of course, but I knew several people back then who believed what they saw on the screen really happened. A lot of the credit for that should go to the actors, particularly Heather Donahue, for doing such a great job of making it seem believable. I just saw it for the first time in probably a decade or more and, while it doesn't hold the same impact as it did initially, it's still a remarkably well-done low-budget psychological horror movie.Yes the movie was heavily hyped but it was deserved, in my opinion. This was a huge box office success built largely on word of mouth which is a testament to its quality. Sadly, because of its popularity, a lot of people bashed the film (and still do, judging by some of these reviews). If by some chance you have never seen this movie, please ignore the haters and give it a fair shot. I know that, after so many found footage horror movies since it was released, it won't seem as fresh. But I think if you drown out the background noise of the whiners and allow yourself to become immersed in the story, you'll find this movie is one of the best of its kind and worthy of praise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Still Shaking...,"I've read some of the negative reviews for this film, and I can't believe they even exist. This is an incredible movie, perhaps the only movie to ever really /scare/ me. I'm a programmer by trade, and it is thus quite easy for me to dissociate myself from characters in a movie. I can look up there and see the characters of your average movie as fake. They appear to me as mere collections of pixels, slapped together on a piece of celluloid and displayed for my amusement. It was not this way with the Blair Witch Project. I saw this movie about 3 hours ago and I'm still scared senseless. I'm still shaking just a bit. I drank a couple shots of bourbon just to try to calm down. Nothing works. This movie is *that* scary. I don't know if it was faked or not, but if it was then I must say that it is a masterpiece. The characters are so afraid and their emotions are so real that even the most jaded among us can't help but empathize with them. And that, really, is the true power of this movie. It's not scary in the way that someone jumping from behind a door and saying 'BOO!' is scary. It's more the kind of scary you feel when you walk down a dark hallway and feel like someone is following you. Or the fear you feel while walking through an unfamiliar alley on a dark, cold night. It is primal fear, a fear which can't be shaken. A fear which is bred into you for your survival. That is the fear that this movie brings out in you.

Wonderful film making!,"This was truly one of the best horror movies that I have ever seen. The best part to me and which most people hate about it was the way you never saw what was doing it.  I was just like in really life were you don't always know what is chasing you or after you.  The movie attacked all your senses it made you laugh, cry and even at the right point jump out of your skin.  This movie was like another I have seen called Cannibal Holocaust (I don't recommend this won to the faint or strong on heart) were they find the film of the lost film crew and see what really happened to them.  Both movies caused alot of people to think that they are real and not just a movie which I liked about them because they do look really and do make you wonder.They movie makers are very smart in that they integrated the Internet with the movie (blairwitch.com).

I'm a big fan of spooky season and I loved any show or movie with a Halloween theme and unknown to me until that point, I'm a huge fan of minimalist film making. I loved the hand held camera work. The three main characters are instantly relatable. The explanation of the doc they were making comes across naturally through the amazing interviews with the town locals. The big characters here are the woods and the darkness. On this canvas my imagination painted a terrifying antagonist that we never see. I didn't need a witch or ghost or murderer. The cast reaction to simple sounds in the night and the day time confused navigation of the woods made me so uncomfortable and on edge. The arguments within the group added to the tension.

My 2nd favorite Horror Movie.,"After Salo, or The 120 Days of Sodom, this is the scariest movie I have seen, and I have seen this 5 times!

Horror films that tap into our hard-wired instinctive fears probe a deeper place than movies with more sophisticated threats. A villain is only an actor, but a shark is more than a shark.""And that is what make The Blair Witch Project so effective. It depends on the sounds of nature that would scare you at night. It is what should really scare you in life. It does not use scary Psycho music(I mean, that's a good movie, but you know when she will die in the shower!), or other warnings. it just let's it happen.And the the most scariest thing is how many times they say the F word!If you want a truly scary movie, look no further than this!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Especially that whiney woman.The final sequence redeemed things SLIGHTLY be being genuinely creepy, and it earns the 1 point I have awarded it.The makers traded so much on their independence and originality, but being independent is not a virtue in itself. You still have to present the audience with something to engage their minds, emotions, fears, whatever. I know it was meant to be a ""faux"" documentary, but that doesn't mean you don't need characters. And a plot.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Reworking Of The Horror Genre,The cultural phenomenon that was The Blair Witch Project cannot be overstated. The found footage era of filmmaking caught hold and became the main way to put forth the horror genre for years. Despite the hundreds of movies that have used this technique only a handful have been any good.The Blair Witch Project succeeds more on what you can't see than what you can. The human terror of darkness is used to full effect here and the actors do such a stellar job of being immersed in the fear of the unknown that it swoops you right along with them. The Blair Witch Project stands as a classic that is still unsettling but also stretched the rules of a genre and how films were made and seen.,10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I wish I could cast a negative vote,"According to the comment guidelines, a post has to be at least four lines long, and can't be single word reviews.  I doubt that copying and pasting the words ""bad"" and ""awful"" over and over again would be allowed.I guess I went into this with too high of an expectation.  Three friends and I tired to see this movie on the third day of the opening weekend, but it was sold out.  So a week later, two of those same friends and I tired again. This time we made it in...with only about six other people.  I know now why there were so few people in the theater that time.  No one was going to see it a second time, and anyone who had seen it before their friends must have done the same thing I did after seeing it...if a friend told me they were going to see it, I did everything possible (short of bludgeoning them with the nearest piece of furniture) to prevent them from seeing it.The home video touch was interesting, and had potential, but it just didn't come off.  The only thing it did for me, was give me the kind of headache and eye strain I get after reading several hundred pages of an engineering textbook or writing a C++ program.  I did not find this movie the least bit scary.  I can think of several other movies that scared or disturbed me much more than this one.  Actually, I spent more time to stiffle my laughter than anything else.I know what some of you are thinking, ""The movie is trying to portray the emotion they are going through being lost out there.  Try putting yourself in their shoes.""  Well, I think I can imagine that desperate feeling they were supposed to be experiencing.  One time while backpacking in the mountains of New Mexico I ended up away from the campsite with several others after dark without any kind of light (it was overcast that night, and somehow six of us forgot to bring along a single flashlight).   It took us an hour to slowly walk only a few hundred yards with everyone holding on to the shoulders of the person in front of them, and the person in front feeling for trees along the side of the trail.  And I don't know how many times I have lay awake in my tent by myself or with one other person trying to figure out if the noises I hear are just the wind, or something looking for a meal, and how big is that something?To this date, I shudder whenever this movie is mentioned.  Not because it scared or disturbed me.  I shudder out of disgust that I wasted so much time on this movie.  I can't believe this actually made it to the big screen. The film should have been burned before it was ever reproduced.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Canny, clever novice filmmaking","Independently-produced thriller filmed on videotape concerning 3 student filmmakers making a documentary about the haunted woods near their Maryland homes. Those looking for a slambang chiller will be disappointed--the budget obviously didn't allow for special effects--but the movie certainly works as an examination of the deterioration of the human mind in crisis, complete with dissension and hysteria. The actors are extremely capable and the results are largely creepy for a one-time viewing. It also deserves credit for tapping into the sudden need in America for ""real"" entertainment. **1/2 from ****.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"I gave it a second chance...Yup, I hate it","Straight out of the Valencia Community College film lab, it's the most famous home movie not featuring Pamela Anderson. I know I don't need to explain the details of The Blair Witch Project, so I will instead focus upon the polarized opinions about it. I did not like this movie at all, but the wide variance in thoughts about it led me to give it a second chance on my home theater system. The few redeeming qualities I forced myself to find were not nearly enough to compensate for the poor overall experience this movie delivers. I will explain the reasons why I do not like it, but I first must comment on what a lot of the positive comments about Blair Witch have been mentioning. Every person is entitled to an opinion, even if that opinion is grossly uninformed and illogical. We all know this. But DO NOT tell me why I don't like this movie. The basic premise of defending The Blair Witch Project is, ""The only reason you don't like this movie is because there aren't any ILM FX, or blood and gore, or big scary monsters in state-of-the-art rubber suits."" There are a lot of people who don't care about those elements in a film that still did not like this particular movie. And, please, don't tell me this is cutting-edge material. If that were true, I would pull out some of the movies we made as kids out of the closet and advertise them as ""breakthrough filmmaking"". We ran around in the woods with a camcorder...could the right advertising make us millionaires too? Anyway... The main reason I disliked this movie (disregarding the obvious personal economic waste it created) was the horrid acting. You won't be seeing any of these actors on ""Whose Line Is It, Anyway?"" anytime soon, unless that show changes it format to screaming and cussing ad nauseum. The motivations behind the character actions were highly questionable at best, which easily transitions into bad dialogue. The movie creates no sympathy for the plight of these whiny, arrogant, silly college students. I was hoping for the visceral thrill of having the Blair Witch appear and stick a bunch of rocks in their mouths, but, alas, no such luck. Sticks and stones...now that I think about, I have solved the mystery of the Blair Witch, right here, sitting on my butt in front of the computer 2000 miles away from Maryland. Sticks tied together. Piles of rocks. Little handprints all over the walls of a house. Middle of the woods. The Blair Witch is (drum roll): Boy Scout Troop 529. You heard it here first.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"A revolutionary movie at the time, but not a very good movie","As a horror film I must say that it is highly overrated since it is not really a very good film, in fact it is quite boring and the only reason why it has some support is because it was made in the form of a documentary, which it makes it look pretty real and a lot of people thought it was a real tape. On that side it is an interesting experiment, but only that could be rescued. It is not a film that anyone can see and it is understood that the way it was made at the time was revolutionary enough to create more films of this nature and that can be recognized, but many films that came later such as Paranormal Activity, VHS or Rec, are in a certain way superior to this film that originated this type of film. This film may now be a classic, but it is another era and it has aged in a different way that is not even scary and that is why as a film itself it is bad, as a horror film it is mediocre and I would only recommend it for those who are curious to want to explore a bit about how to do something independent with few resources since I see this film more as study material and not as a film itself. Personally I think the sequel is a little better and the third is undoubtedly the best of the trilogy because at least it's seriously scary. My rating for this movie is 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Tom Thumb has a picnic at hanging rock.,"This movie,along with ""the sixth sense"" and some recent other ones ,is the volte-face of the fantasy and horror genre.The disappearance of these special effects which has been defacing the ""scary movies"" since ,say,""the exorcist"".A return to pure psychological suspense.Like Don Siegel 's ""invasion of the body snatchers""(1956),there are here no stars,and a shoestring budget.The form is unique,for it is an amateur camera work,almost a draft,giving the terrible feeling the heroes have really been through it all.The fears we feel in this work recall childhood terrors:the forest,when you are small may be beguiling ,but it's also an unknown world.Who has never been afraid of getting lost in this maze of trees and bushes?That's Tom Thumb syndrome:in the movie,the heroine's map is an equivalent of Tom Thumb's stones.These stones which the three lads find in front of the tent might be a nod in the direction of Charles Perrault;as the (witch's?) house might be a hint at Grimm's ""Hansel and Gretel"".Most of the terror happens in the midday sun:a fantasy and horror movie does not necessarily mean darkness.I would go as far as saying that the scenes in the daylight are the scariest:Peter Weir opened up the way in 1977 with his classic ""picnic at hanging rock"".The three characters 'roaming round this quiet place , waiting for SOMETHING to happen,all this is  extremely disturbing.There's an impending menace,but we do not know exactly what it is,and our fears are  increased tenfold.Strange signs along the way ,a gruesome treasure hunt. At night,the screen becomes sometimes completely black:in all,about five minutes(!),enough to put the spectator in a cold sweat.Like ""picnic at hanging's rock"" or""the haunting"" (1963),the ending leaves you in front of a huge hole.A movie to treasure.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Something Unique!,"Is this movie scary? To be honest, no it isn't, not really. Does this mean the film is bad? No, quite the contrary really, the film is very good.

But this attempt proved to be quiet effective.Perhaps this film might have been more scary in the movie theaters but watching it at home creates a difficult environment to become scared in. There were never any moments that made me even the slightest bit startled, the film played more onto the realistic factor of horror, things that make you uncomfortable and nervous.The acting in this film is outstanding, some of the best I've seen in a while, never stale, never artificial.

Interesting trip into the psyche of the young film makers and their meeting with the unknown.,"I think this movie is way over hyped.

Out of the 87 minutes, about 15 are just downright creepy, and the other 72 minutes kind of leave you asking for more, or atleast what the trailers and the website promises.

The film has a number of unresolved and unexplained elements to it; while some people find these exasperating, I enjoy revisiting these little puzzles.

I was raised on a diet of old black and white Dracula movies and me and my sister used to sit up every Friday night, pillows ready to hide our faces, being scared stupid by these movies. Looking back at these movies now they are not vary scary but they are not graphic either. You only ever got to see some vague shadows and very little else. Every thing else was in you imagination.The Blair Witch Project has tapped into this fear very effectively. By not showing what is stalking our hapless adventures the directors are letting our imaginations run riot as to who or what is following them.I think younger viewers of this movie has been brought up watching films where every thing was shown and nothing was left up to the imagination. They wanted to be shown everything and were disappointed when they weren't.This movie is unique and could not be made in the same style again until this movie is a distant memory.If you like  to let you imagination take over from the movie makers this movie is for you.

The Blair Witch Project is definitely a hidden gem,"Horrifyingly amazing! The Blair Witch Project takes a creative twist to the definition of horror movies. This movie gave me chills. The reason this film is so bone-chilling is because of its stress-inducing scenes. At first I couldn't tell why it was so creepy, because the Blair Witch wasn't in the film, but you knew it was there. I've never heard such a gut wrenching scream until I heard the friend who disappeared in the distance. I could feel the goosebumps forming and my heart racing. The Blair Witch Project is definitely a hidden gem for sure.Visually, for a ""found footage"" horror movie alot of work was put into it. I did feel like it could be real.. I found the whole movie believable. For instance the setting of the woods is obviously an overused idea but the film makes it work in a fresh way. They are lost, they have a tent for shelter which isn't particularly comforting, they have little food, no means of protection, heavy filming equipment and little off track hiking experience. All these factors portrays such a stressful environment, building up emotions to create an unbearable atmosphere. (Which is also great for horror lovers)....... The sound effects I absolutely loved. I cannot fault much on this topic,this was a ""found footage"" horror movie and I personally did not have high expectations.. however, I can genuinely say I was wrong from one of the cast getting dragged away screaming, to the howling from the night time creepy crawlers.. It created such an uncomfortable suspense that I thoroughly enjoyed.In conclusion, I think this horror movie is very unique and one of its kind. It was filled with suspense and edge-of-your-seat feelings, also there was one part with a little gore but not much. For a found footage horror movie it absolutely smashes it it's a very thought through movie and enjoyable for all horror fans. I definitely recommend watching....

This outing supposedly takes place in 1994, when the group heads out but is never heard from again.Knowing that the story wasn't true, I wasn't too scared.

All they did was go into the forest, get lost, kick the map into a river, lose one of their mates, get very scared, end. The ending was totally c**p and it was way to sudden. They go in the house, run up and down some stairs, and bingo they fall over and the movie ends. When I saw the credits come up I exclaimed a mixture of WTF and you have to be f**king kidding!

A Treat for Film Students,"There is nothing worse than watching a movie with film students. They not only complain about technical aspects, but they usually think of the way they would have shot the same script. For four years working at the Havana Film and Television School, I went through this, and I suppose I caught some of their ""disease."" The consequences of this ""film alphabetization"" came to the forum while watching ""The Blair Witch Project."" I remembered the students' approval of something good, as well as their loud reactions, their laughter and booing. At the same time I was questioning the film during the whole projection. This does not mean I did not find it an interesting film experience (I saw it in a theater, and I was the only customer). Quite the contrary: it is an original cinematic concept, an intelligent reflection on fear, and a good definition of horror as nothing but a state of mind, related to ignorance and darkness. However in too many occasions more than I can remember right now-- the situations were barely credible on technical and dramatic grounds: for example, would you believe someone lost in the woods (Heather) would keep on taping images while discovering that another person (Mike) has thrown their only connection to civilization --a map-- to the river? Well, Heather shouts at Mike like hell but she never stops gazing through the visor of her video camera! She is one of the most obnoxious characters ever to appear on a film (see during the first part, how she does not let her interviewees finish their sentences), not only for her bully ways but also for her obsessive recording of a ""documentary."" She is not a filmmaker; she is just a student working on a project, because of which her life is in danger. Before the resolution, there is a brief moment when Heather and Mike are alone in the darkness, inside the tent, when it seems improbable that the recorder would be registering sounds. And on top of that, we are not told that this is the edited and Dolby version of the found footage, a fact that predisposes the ""film alphabetized"" viewer to distance himself/herself from the film, and smile at the naïve opening title. But it is a remarkable film nonetheless, although the overrating affects the objective appreciation of the filmmakers' good work.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The scariest thing about this film was how badly the critics overrated it,"When Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez came up with the idea to create a mock documentary made solely to creep people out, they were definitely playing around with a good idea.  The movie could be made on an extremely tight budget.  The shaky camera work and poor film quality would actually do the film a service, by making it seem all the more genuine.  And, finally, the movie could rake in a fortune because, when you think about it, who doesn't like to hear a good ghost story, every so often?  Too bad this one doesn't chill you to the bone, like the directors had intended.The long, arduous filler scenes used between the scares also made Witch a less-than-perfect ""project.""  We have the 2 minute horror scene, during the night, then the 10 minute filler, during the day.  After 2 or 3 times, this cycle becomes an exercise in tedium.  Not to mention, despite what everyone is saying, the horror scenes weren't really that terrifying . . . with exception to one.It is this scene, the last 5 minutes of the film, where The Blair Witch Project succeeds amazingly well.  What is revealed during the last 5 minutes of Witch (don't worry, I'm not going to tell you what it is), will have the hairs on the back of your neck standing on end.  This isn't something you'll forget easily.  Once you've seen it, it's gonna be ingrained inside of your brain for a long time.

Excellence!,"This film is one of the best horror films of all time.  The format in which THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was filmed created an eerie sense of realism, as did the terror etched on the faces of the three actors.  The realism was only added to by the actors using their real names.  THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT will unquestionably go down in the annals of movie history as one of the most believable films ever made.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
SAVE ME,"I saw this film for nothing and i still felt ripped off at the end.  I just wish I could think of a way of turning a bag of pants into loads of money.It's really hard to find any words to say how bad this film is.  I gather it's meant to be scary or spooky.  Well Big Bird has got more tension in his alphabet song than the Blair Witch. How it worked for so many people, i do'nt know.  It's a while since i've seen the film, so facts may be wrong but i'm not going to watch it again to correct them. Lets just say something like this did happen.  You'd be up and out of that wood before you could say brown trousers.  It's not something you'd stay for if you were actually there.  Also when you're really scared, it's always the same is'nt it.  Your camera sticks.  It happens to me all the time. Please save me from these pointless films. Just don't spend your time getting involved with this garbage.

The film is made almost entirely without resources. It is the result of an idea well conceived and developed with a creativity rarely seen and not so common in Hollywood,"If we talk about an innovative idea and profitable, we can speak of The Blair Witch Project. A film that still causes arguments, controversies, mainly curiosity and fear in those who watch it. The two directors, American Daniel Myrick and Cuban Eduardo Sanchez, practically in their debuts in the cinema produced the film with only $40 thousand dollars and had the highest cost-effective as possible for a film, grossing over $240 million globally, and U. S. $ 140 million in the U. S. alone. No doubt this is and I think always will be the most cost-effective for a film in cinema history.At the time the film was released in 1999, the internet was still far from being as it is today. It was still very dark and that the world was surrounded by uncertainty about where sources of information to trust and identify if certain facts were real. Often a rumor spread and it was taken for granted. And that's exactly what happened with The Blair Witch Project. The directors and the studio created something really innovative in a marketing propaganda never before seen over the internet by creating a website that promoted the whole story of the movie was real. Many people who watched the film at Sundance in 1999, just thought it was a documentary, and seeing the film were frightened by the images and the lack of information about the project, starting to think that the actors were actually killed. To the IMDB, the largest database of world cinema, announced the death of the actors on their website as being the day that the tape recordings was found in the movie, as said just at its beginning. Of course shortly after the error has been corrected.From this information and the word of mouth caused by extraordinary who would see the film, which were clearly in doubt if the film was real or not, their popularity was unimaginable, especially among young people. Curious is the same as the production was held. The directors wanted the same fear and dread were genuine and direction method here is really innovative, more like a lesson in film school, with few resources and money and creativity to spare. Filmmakers invited three unknown actors who entered the project without knowing virtually nothing of the plot and what would happen to them, they only learned scene after scene. The three actors were left in the woods and they just GPS so they could be located and obviously the cameras. The actors had to spend a few days camping in the swamp, while being followed and submitted to the producer of the movie scares. When they arrived at locations determined by the team, received tickets to individual instructions and could not be shown to others, letting the actions of others realistic, even more all being hungry, sleep and physical and mental fatigue. Therefore, in many discussions of the actors, it was really happening by factors.This method of shooting further increased the realism, the tension between the actors, which added to the editing done well (also made by the directors) in perfect weather and dry (86 minutes), are leaving the movie so terrifying. To improve everything, no other artifice, like blood, monsters and caused by sound effects, was used. The dialogue between the actors totally improvised are also critical for everything to work, so that naturally appear. The absence of sound, letting the sound of the forest without editing only enhances the idea of documentary realism and that many felt when first seeing the film.

No doubt this is and I think always will be the most cost-effective for a film in cinema history.The plot could not be simpler, showing three film students who traveled to the town of Burkittsville, in the state of Maryland, in order to film a documentary about a local legend - the existence of Blair Witch Project, responsible for disappearances and killings woods around the site in the last 200 years, especially in the 40s where several children appeared dead on the spot. Confident that everything was just a legend, the young show no signs of concern until a series of unfortunate coincidences causes them to be lost, and various noises in the forest indicating that they cannot completely alone. A year later, the footage they found and the film is actually an edited tape by the local police from the tapes left by students. The images recorded by the trio gave clues about what happened to the young.The film is divided into parts. In the first, shown students coming near the forest where they will make a documentary. They meet after chatting and interviewing locals who live nearby forest where there is the legend of the witch. After a good first day, with many testimonials they leave with a map into the woods. The second half hour of the plot shows the students fican lost after losing the map, and start walking in circles and despair. And also begin to hear noises and voices in the night, leaving them terrified. In the last minute, they end up coming to a hut, where the final frightening events happen.At the time the film was released in 1999, the internet was still far from being as it is today.

The idea that they are not alone in that forest, and the noise can be anything from another human being, or an animal of the forest, mainly and most likely, a witch who supposedly lives there on the spot. Everything is in the speculative field and many questions are on our minds, especially at the end. The clues point even if there really is a witch in place, the voices they hear mostly just noise and not being listened to three. But when they enter the cabin, the witch is really exists? What evidence we have, besides the voices screaming in the woods for help? Where Mike looked in the final moments of the film? Who dropped the camera and the students themselves? The end could not be better, since throughout its duration, is the question whether the witch really exists or not. In the end, the question is maintained and the ending was wisely left open.The Blair Witch Project is slow, images taken with handheld cameras, always shaky. You do not have a single drop of blood the whole movie. The film cannot just be treated as a horror movie. He is also a documentary well done and a drama full of despair and conflict. One of the scenes that mix horror and drama is the poster for the film, which shows precisely this tense and dramatic moment is when Heather Donahue apologizes to the family of your friends by having them brought up there with her.

The fact that these 2 unknown directors could make up a crappy legend, to go with a crappy plot and crappy actors that were supposedly not acting (yeah right), it's amazing the movie was so successful. I completely hated it. Without a doubt, I have never seen a movie so awful. If you want scary, go rent The Sixth Sense.

A realistic look at terror,"After a half-decade of ironic slasher films, it is a chill wake up call to be reminded what terror really looks like.This film really isn't that ""scary."" (really.) But what is fantastic about it is the realistic sheen it gives the growing panic and terror of three would-be documentary film makers.What creeps us out? It really isn't the thought of a madman killer, or a swift, fatal disease--it is the unknown, the odd. And this film is full of the unsettling...the inexplicable. And that is why this film succeeds. Not by making us shriek in terror, but by giving us a gnawing feeling of unease and doubt.One last note: If you are prone to motion sickness, wait for the video. I had a splitting headache after I left the theatre from the swinging p.o.v. of the film's finale.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Not as scary once you know the truth, but still scary","Alfred Hitchcock once said that what we don't see is often scarier than what we do. Thanks to the advent of modern horror, where it's all about gore and jump scares, this idea is very rarely utilized anymore. Thankfully, movies like The Blair Witch Project exist to show that not only can it still be done, but done effectively. Some people may claim this is a film where nothing happens. While I agree with that to a certain degree, that's kind of the point. It's all about the buildup and the atmosphere, which help the scary moments really stand out and hit extra hard. It's helped along by a very minimalistic approach, relying mainly on creepy sounds and the reactions from the characters to create a feeling of mounting dread, tension, and eventually terror. Of course, what the film is probably best known for is the brilliant marketing campaign that fooled viewers into thinking it really happened. And, while the effect is lessened once you know it's all fake, it's still pretty terrifying. If I had one complaint about the film's presentation, it's that we're never told exactly who or what the Blair Witch is. It's not a huge problem, since we learn enough to get the gist, but a prologue establishing her backstory or even some exposition from the locals interviewed at the start would have been appreciated.The acting from the three main leads is admittedly hit and miss. They were not professional actors (this was their first role) and as such, their acting can come off as incredibly hokey, melodramatic, and hammy, especially Heather Donahue. However, they have good chemistry with each other and manage to sell the growing paranoia, fear, and hostility toward each other. Donahue in particular, despite my earlier comment, absolutely shines in the famous scene where her face is right up against the camera in the dark while she records an apology to her friends and their parents.Helping to sell the idea that this is real is the decision to film entirely on various hand held cameras, hence the term ""found footage film"". The directing is deliberately amateurish, with lots of shaky cam, blurry vision, and switches back and forth between the camera that's in color and the one in black and white. This, along with the sound design and lack of music, all lends to the intended effect of making it look like legitimate footage of something that really happened and, even when you know otherwise, it does a good job of leaving you with an unsettling feeling, not knowing what's going to happen next.Overall, The Blair Witch Project deserves a lot more love than it gets. It's still a very creepy, unnerving film that really stuck with me even after I learned the truth. And sure, it started a trend of found footage horror films that's really gotten old. But, that doesn't change the effectiveness of the one that started it all.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Flawed but clever, and provokes amusing criticism","TBWP has many flaws - the implausibility of some of the characters' behaviour, the irritation factor of watching people bicker for an hour, and so on. That said, it is an interesting little film with some clever touches (the interviewee's child covering her mother's mouth; the handprints in the house etc.). Scary? Not really, but then that couldn't be more subjective could it? THE EXORCIST had some people vomiting in the aisles yet it doesn't scare me at all (but the reverse could be true of another film). Anyway I personally I give TBWP six out of ten. What I find hilarious is the nature of the criticism this film has received since its release, which is almost as OTT as the hype that preceded it.Most of those people who insist that is the worst film ever made are as one-eyed as those who said a year ago that it was the best. I notice that the early comments on the IMDb were nearly all hysterically complimentary, and now they're nearly all hysterically savage. There's nothing like a good bandwagon to jump on is there? (Or did the film suddenly metamorphosize from a classic to a turkey sometime last autumn?) This isn't the worst film ever made; there are countless worse (see the IMDb's own ""100 worst"" list for some prime examples). Harbouring unfettered resentment at the film-makers because you've seen an over-hyped movie is hardly a platform for objective criticism. If anyone had seen a film of this standard on late night TV and not cared for it they'd have turned it off and forgotten about it, and certainly not worked themselves into a frenzy about how awful it was. I particularly enjoyed reading the comments of those BWP-haters on here who remarked upon the ""suckers"" and ""idiots"" who actually watched it (can you spot something of an own goal here?).The oft-repeated refrain that this film is ""cheap"" and ""amateurish"" beggars belief. Since it was made cheaply by then-amateurs, was hyped as a cheap film made by amateurs, and purports to be a cheap documentary made by amateurs, I would have thought its cheapness and amateurishness was rather to be expected. Given that the protagonists are supposed to be making little more than a home movie, the complaint about the jerky camera movements in this context is especially absurd - or would you have Heather & Co. set up dollies, cranes, and so on as they flee through the woods? If you've automatically got it in for this style of film-making (and you'd have to have been on Mars not to have known how TBWP was shot) why go and see it?THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT has actually gone up in my estimation because it's reminded me of the power of movies to provoke the audience, and the public reaction to this film has been priceless. My absolute favourite comment I keep reading is ""I could have made this!"" Well since it cost next to nothing and those who made it are now multi-millionaires, why the f*** didn't you?",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Worst serious horror movie of the 90s,"I'll start with saying that I am really big horror fan with capital B and as I have heard Blair Witch Project is one of the scariest horror movies ever. This is hilarious. I can't believe somebody really get scared by such a crappy movie. The movie of course has the usual ""true story"" sign, but this time we are brought the story itself as a footage. Yeah, what we see had really happened from what I understood. And the worst thing is that people had believe it 7 years ago and I still read posts about Blair Witch Project being an example of a really scary movie. There are even people who don't find it scary, but they like it. Otherwise, I can't explain that ending, this popularity and its sequel which I haven't seen and I don't intend to do it in this life. And the really really worst of all, is that people had believed it as I said. I guess that if I believed in this, I would have liked it. It is similar to My Little Eye which is a really good horror movie that made me look behind my back. We have stupid teens overacting, camera looking like a home video and some interviews with people convincing the audience and the teens themselves that this curse or whatever it is, really exist. Oh, and we have no themes and songs, cause it is supposed to be happening for real and 5 years later this tape is a movie that is supposed to scare us.This is basically The Blair Witch Project. I don't like the story, but I would have appreciated the try to be recreated with actors and normal camera with themes. It would have been stupid, but nothing stupid that tries to conquer the genre with its reality. This sucks. I got bored, I nearly fell asleep after 40 boring minutes and then I realized that whatever happens till the end of the movie, I would hate it and the movie I hate could be counted on the fingers of the persons involved with this story.

Take my advice and wait for the video release,"I know, I know, most of you feel this is the scariest movie of all time. The only scary thing about this movie was the fact that it cost $9.50 to see it.  Everyone who claims this is a masterpiece in horror needs to understand that their desperation to see a good horror movie has blinded their thought to think this was scary.  We have been deprived of scary movies for too long and we are too eager to jump on the Blair Witch to get a quick fix.Hey, don't get me wrong, this movie was brilliant, but not scary.  I applaud Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez for creating an original and unique movie with such a limited budget and cast.  They have proven that you don't need a billion dollars to make a good movie that makes a ton of money. If I were to compare the Haunting(newly released) and the Blair witch Project, I would have to say that the Blair Witch supersedes the Haunting in both its ability to scare and the entertainment factor.  However, they are both two movies you don't want to waste your hard earned money on.The Blair Witch was astounding in originality, the acting was great and believable, and the filming was superb except for the times when I got a headache trying to focus on a jumping screen.  However, and this is a big however, they forgot to put in the scary parts.  The story was great, but they forgot to put in the scary parts.

A great movie but not an experience most people got or ever will.,"Firstly while this may be the first ""found footage"" film many hear about there was one at least back in the 50's 60's with found footage regarding a horror locked in Ice in the arctic or antarctic.Secondly the real greatness of the Blair Witch Project was how was an internet experience which nobody will get to experience again. They had a ""News"" website with periodic reports and leaked footage and experiences from townsfolk building up this whole mystery and at the time it wasn't being presented as an upcoming movie release but as a true event unfolding there, leading up to the release of the movie as if it was a documentary presenting the facts as they were known. So if you hadn't experienced the website at the time the movie falls flat as many people see it, but in conjunction it delivered an amazing experience which nobody else has ever achieved. Many of the ""news reports of murders and locations we heard about on the website really connected the movie viewer to the locations when we reached them in the film.

I simply cannot enjoy this movie.,"The Blair Witch Project is one of the pioneers of found footage that much is true. That being said this review is an honest review of a very young man who simply dislikes the movie. The reason I stress 'young man' is I understand (to an extent) that people back in 1999 felt very differently to this movie. I've heard it was taken as if it was real by many and there wasn't much like it. However I can only review it from my own personal experience and perspective.Now that all of that clarification is out of the way I must say i find this movie utterly abysmal. The first 25 minutes of the movie are simply boring. The interviews with the locals at the beginning add nothing and you forget about them by the time the credits roll. The other part of the first 25 minutes is the main three cast members walking through a forest with very little interesting dialogue and nothing of note in the visual department. After this point it doesn't get much better, but it at least picks up the pace slightly (if only barely).The movie lack absolutely anything remotely scary or creepy and unless I am ever in a forest at night would never illicit a horrifying memory. Less is not always more and this movie is a perfect example of that. Even considering it's low budget (that I do not believe was used well), it's still an utterly boring experience.The best part of this movie is easily the acting although I would not go as far to suggest the acting is good let alone brilliant. It's easily passable however and dare I say average. This is considering they're not A-List actors and the extremely low budget they had to work with (comparatively speaking).The ending of the movie is not at all satisfying, but considering how awful the movie is it has no affect on the end rating I would give the movie. Compared to the vast majority of found footage movies I have seen (most being long after this but not all) I must say it is easily one of the worst with no place for wiggle room in my eyes.I weirdly still recommend watching the movie simply because people always talk about it when it comes to horror let alone found footage. So I believe you should probably get this off your radar as soon as possible if it's on it. But I believe most of the hype around this movie is due to nostalgia rather than It genuinely being any good. But this review is only my opinion and please feel free to heavily disagree.1/10.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"extremely boring, 100% hype","The only possible way this 'film' could be bearable to audiences would be to lie to them and tell them it really happened, and this was the actual footage - which is exactly what the film makers did.I saw the film after I knew it wasn't real.  I alternated between being bored and annoyed for the entire 45 minutes I watched it.  After 45 minutes of suffering, I just had to stop watching (it was either that or put a bullet in my head).  If you are going to make a film without a script, you damn well better have actors who can improvise - unfortunately, the 'actors' in Blair Witch do not have that ability.Wouldn't it be funny if a poorly written movie with no plot, no script, bad acting, and bad filming could be hyped enough to make millions of dollars? The joke is on us, the paying public, and I'm not laughing.0 out of 10 - totally without merit.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""Have you ever heard of the Blair Witch?""","""In October of 1994, three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland, while shooting a documentary.  A year later their footage was found.""That is the making of a scary, intense, and sometimes even funny film.  The Blair Witch Project's notorious reputation precedes it and makes it quite possibly the most infamous movie ever produced.  It's also one of the most cheaply made, highest grossing, most parodied films of all time.  Most of those statements are made because of pure marketing genius.  The concept isn't quite as original as you'd like to believe.  It has been done before, but I don't think it has worked before.  Blair Witch ""borrows"" the mockumentary concept of The Last Broadcast and improves upon it three-fold. It's a great story with real characters in a real situation and how they deal with it.  It's all about realism.  To this very day, some people believe this actually happened.  I think that's where the hatred comes from; people don't like to be tricked.  Love it or hate it, you can't forget it. The Blair Witch Project IS a landmark horror film.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Brilliantly made, but not scary","I heard from a few people that this was meant to be both believable and scary, but after watching it I found it to be all suspense and no climax. I enjoyed the film and found that the ending was good, but I didn't see anything to get scared about. Plus the characters, although were believable, begun to get annoying.After reading about how it was made, I was greatly impressed and I did feel that it did have a very realistic feel about it. Maybe it was just that I got my hopes up and was expecting to be terrified. Overall a good movie, brilliantly made, but if you want to be scared out of your mind its not for you.. :)",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Whether you love it or you hate it, you have to respect The Blair Witch Project for its uniqueness and its originality.","One of the many unique things about the Blair Witch Project is that no one liked it. Everyone who saw it either absolutely loved it or absolutely hated it, there was unusually little in between. It should be noted that no one has ever made a professional film like this before. People often joke about a movie being so bad that a student filmmaker could make a better one. Well, a student filmmaker really COULD make a movie like the Blair Witch Project, but the point is that no one has ever made a film this deliberately crude and yet attained such stunning success.The makers of the Blair Witch Project cleverly avoid the inevitable comparisons to student films by making the actual premise of the film as a student documentary. That's what makes the movie so good! The tagline is about a bunch of kids who went into the woods, got lost, and whose video footage was found a year later. That makes the film itself realistic beyond all other horror films. The methods of production enabled the actors to present an even more convincing portrayal of a bunch of kids lost in the woods and desperate to get out. A lot of times they didn't even know what was going on with the picture, they really WERE lost and confused. Another notable element of this movie is the way that they were able to create such a tense atmosphere with a virtual absence of gore. This is proof that you do not need buckets of blood in order to make a good scary movie.So many people complained about the shaky camera work in the Blair Witch Project. They say that it was terrible filmmaking because the camera is always bouncing around, but that was done on purpose! Don't these people realize that the home video look was the primary goal for the finished product here? These kids didn't go out into the woods to shoot this documentary with a full-on film crew complete with caterers and everything else, they went ALONE. However, there was a little bit of botched editing in this film. It is meant to be presented as though they found their video cameras, and what you see on the screen is simply what they recorded on their cameras, with little, if any, editing. Obviously the two cameras they used needed to be edited together so that they show the same material, but there was at least one scene where Heather was seen on the opposite side of a stream crossing the log (the one that they had come back to), but her voice is heard as though it is her holding the camera.Overall, the Blair Witch Project is a very original and satisfying horror movie, but you have to have an open mind. You have to be able to accept something that was made different than your traditional movie is made, and try to really understand what is different about it and what makes it good. I think that one of the best things about the story is that it leaves so much to the imagination. You never see what is actually tormenting them from out in the woods, all you see is the dark, and that makes every individual audience member imagine whatever it is that they fear the most out there in those woods. In this sense, the film is almost interactive. No other horror film has ever come close to doing anything like that, and the Blair Witch Project should be recognized for it. This is an original, entertaining, and ultimately terrifying film, and you see something new every time you see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"If you go down to the woods, PLEASE take more than one camera","After seeing this film way back when it was released I came out of the theatre struck dumb and feeling rather nauseous. Not due to anything horrifying up on the screen - if only there had been - but simply down to the jerky and repetitive camera-work.Blair Witch is an admirable idea, yet the directors stick too rigidly to their premise. By using one camera they induced seasickness in me, and no doubt a good many other people going by the comments at IMDb. To provoke fear you often have to create a sense of scale and movement - think Jaws, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Psycho to name but three. Fear is just as much about open spaces and a sense of isolation as it is about dark corners and close-ups.Clearly the premise of the film - three film students, missing for five years - demanded certain limits on the storytelling, yet sometimes you have more to play with than you realise. If the story is that compelling, and in fairness the Blair Witch idea was good, no matter what the vengeful critics say, then you wonder how much better this film might have been had suddenly a second camera appeared, tracking the threesome through the woods. Told lucidly enough, the audience would probably not even question it.Some of the reviewers of this film have been harsh to put it mildly. No, it's not a great horror film, but it is an important one if for no other reason than it shows what can be done with basic equipment and a few thousand dollars.As I write this review, some ten years or so after seeing Blair Witch for the first time, we are in the middle of a recession, yet what d'you know, James Cameron has just spent $300million making Avatar, some ten years after spending $180million to make Titanic.Perhaps what's really bugged the film industry, and even some of the audience, is that two young film-makers found a way to dwarf the mega budget releases of Hollywood with a film that made more money than 90% of Hollywood, yet for no more than thirty thousand dollars.Blair Witch is not great, but it does have something important to say; namely that you don't HAVE to have a $300million budget in order to make a hit film these days. That surely, is reason to be hopeful.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""Scary as Hell""...I don't think so","I don't think it gets much worse than this movie.  The only scary thing about it is that someone could make a movie that is so bad.  There are not words to describe how bad this movie is.  I thought it looked like and interesting movie so I went to see it, and it is a very short movie (87 minutes I think) but while watching this movie it seems to go on for hours. This is the most boring movie I have ever seen.  Heather felt she needed to tape everything they saw which got very annoying.  I think I have only hated about 5 movies in my life but this is definitely one of them.  I am not a person who saw it once and judged it, I saw it about 5 times and it gets worse every time.

A must see for anyone who wants to be scared,"This movie is not for everyone. Young children shouldn't be seeing this movie, and probably no one under the age of 14 or 15. It's VERY intense. There's a great deal of profanity. The movie is so true to reality that it's impossible to distinguish that it's really only a movie (or is it? you decide). The movie has no blood or gore (except for a very small bit of blood that totals no more than 30 seconds of camera time) and no music to lead you to fear - instead, it relies purely on psychological terror and one of humankind's biggest fears - being hunted. My suggestion if you're going to see this movie when it premiers - park your car in a dark, isolated spot. As you're struggling to get back to your car, you'll realize how scary a movie can really be. This movie is no less than excellent. It's put together well and it's unlike any horror movie ever made.

If you go down to the woods today...,"A real horror film is always primarily about the psychology of fear, which leaves the movie maker with one key decision: how much to show, and how much to leave only in the mind.  'The Blair Witch Project' exists as the video diaries of some self-obsessed film-makers, making a film about themselves investigating the legend of a local witch.  As well as being an interesting experiment in narrative legitimacy, it also provides a novel solution to the aforementioned dilemma: we see exactly what the characters see for themselves.  It's convincingly done, and truly spine-chilling.  The ""heroes"" are annoying American brats, but as their plight deepens, one is taken with the sense that they're going to die.  The result is harrowing, and more resembles the BBC's story of nuclear winter, 'Threads', than any conventional horror film.  Not exactly light entertainment, but genuinely good nonetheless.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Damn good horror movie!,"Anyone who has even the slightest trouble with insomnia after seeing a horror movie should stay away from The Blair Witch Project--this film will creep under your skin and stay there for days. Credit for the effectiveness of this mock documentary goes to filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, who armed three actors (Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, and Josh Leonard) with video equipment, camping supplies, and rough plot outlines. They then let the trio loose into the Maryland woods to improvise and shoot the entire film themselves as the filmmakers attempted to scare the crap out of them. Gimmicky, yes, but it worked--to the wildly successful tune of $130 million at the box office upon its initial release (the budget was a mere $40,000). For those of you who were under a rock when it first hit the theaters, The Blair Witch Project tracks the doomed quest of three film students shooting a documentary on the Burkittsville, Maryland, legend of the Blair Witch. After filming some local yokels (and providing only scant background on the witch herself), the three, led by Heather (something of a witch herself), head into the woods for some on-location shooting. They're never seen again. What we see is a reconstruction of their ""found"" footage, edited to make a barely coherent narrative. After losing their way in the forest, whining soon gives way to real terror as the three find themselves stalked by unknown forces that leave piles of rocks outside their campsite and stick-figure art projects in the woods. (As Michael succinctly puts it, ""No redneck is this clever!"") The masterstroke of the film is that you never actually see what's menacing them; everything is implied, and there's no terror worse than that of the unknown. If you can wade through the tedious arguing--and the shaky, motion-sickness-inducing camera-work--you'll be rewarded with an oppressively sinister atmosphere and one of the most frightening denouements in horror-film history. Even after you take away the monstrous hype, The Blair Witch Project remains a genuine, effective original.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The worst movie of all time,"This film is horrific. It's horrific that it came fifth in Channel 4's scary moment poll; it's horrific that it got good reviews, and it's even more horrific that people actually like this trash. Quite simply, The Blair Witch Project is the worst film of all time. ...and yet somehow, while this film is on the same level of crappyness as films like Freddy got fingered and The Fast and the furious (except Blair Witch isn't as good as those two), I still get the feeling that someone is going to disagree with me.For the first part of this review, I will be doing things a little differently than usual. Usually I would write out my views of the film in paragraphs, however, this time, to highlight the misinterpretations that people have of this film, I'm going to show you what my TV guide's say:Named and Shamed 1: 'What's on TV' (The UK's best selling TV magazine)""Three student film makers get lost in the woods while investigating a legend. Forsaking special effects, this low budget documentary-style fright fest is a return to the basics of what screen horror should be all about - sheer terror""****/****Errrr...what? Excuse me, 'Sheer terror', pardon me if I'm wrong, but when I think of sheer terror, getting lost in the woods isn't the first thing that springs to mind. And where the hell did they get 'fright fest' from? I spent most of the movie waiting for something to happen, not being scared out of my wits. sheesh.Named and Shamed 2: 'Weekend' (The TV magazine that comes free with 'The Daily Mail' on a Saturday)""How does a film with a tiny budget, no stars and no effects become one of the scariest movies ever? Simple, by making the audience believe that what they are seeing is real. That's the ingenious mind game carried off by this 1999 horror hit, which pretended to be the video diary of three film students lost in a Maryland wood""****/*****Well, first off, credit where credit's due, at least they didn't give it full marks. I'll talk more about the mind game thing later but I don't how that makes the film scary, so what something that's not scary but real is somehow scary now? When I was about 10 my grandfather videoed me playing football, that was real, but was it terrifying? No.I have a more simple answer for their question though: It doesn't.Named and Shamed 3: Sky TV's information button""This terrifying film follows three student film makers who went in search if the Blair Witch only to discover the meaning of true horror""I think this is my favourite of the three comments. 'the meaning of true horror', oh what? So the meaning of true horror is walking around the woods with a camera? sheesh, its ok guys, none of us have anything to worry about ever if that's as bad as it gets.People seem to think that no gore, no special effects and no big shocks are a good thing. And they can be, if done correctly. Take Rosemary's Baby for example, there is a film that has no gore, no effects and no big jumpy moments, and it worked, know why? It has an idea behind it. The idea that a woman could be carrying the child of the devil is a genuinely frightening idea, it probes into the unknown, and that is a terrifying thing to do. Getting lost in the woods, not only doesn't probe into the unknown (people have been lost in the woods before); it's just genuinely not scary. Maybe getting lost in the woods with a man eating bear might be a scary thought, but just getting lost in the woods isn't. Ok, if you really did get lost in the woods it might be frightening, but for a film, I think we need a bit more plot than that.For a film to be good, we're not talking Oscar winner here, just merely good, it needs to have several things, including:a plot a decent script Direction Acting WatchabilityBlair Witch doesn't have any of these. Look:a plot - Plot? What plot? Ok, so we have a reason why they go in the woods, but once they get there, then what? Nothing happens except for them finding a few twigs and stuff hanging from trees. Lame. a decent script - I realise that they were trying to make things look real, which gives the effect that there isn't a script but whereas in most other films the script is used to move the story along, in this film all the script is a bunch of shouting and moaning. I mean, ok, fine you're lost in the woods but surely you wouldn't just sit there shouting at each other all day. Direction - I think it's hard to judge whether or not this was directed. It just looked to me like a bunch of bad camera angles loosely strewn together.Acting - Wasn't any. Watchability - I can't see any reason to watch this film. I mean watch the film again. It just isn't watchable, the way the camera(s) move is annoying, and it's hard to tell what's going on most of the time. Well, really nothing goes on. The movie's more boring than Streetcar.The producers of Blair Witch however realised that to sell a film, you don't need those five things, you just need one thing: marketing. And sadly, they were right.I remember back in 1999 when this crap....err...film was released. Out of nowhere came great reviews, spouting crap like 'it's terrifying'. I didn't go to see it as soon as it came out, but some of my friends and family did, and every single one of them came back saying that it sucked. However, I thought 'uneducated fools, what do they know?' and then guess what? I went to see it and they were right. It's a good job the film wasn't much longer, I reckon I'd have left if it were.Then we've got this mind game thing. About it being real footage. When I first went to see it this rumour was still ripe and I thought it was really real. Well, actually I was under the impression that this was a film based on actual footage, not the actual footage itself, but anyway, same difference. So how come I still wasn't in the least frightened? And how come even now, now that everyone knows that the rumours aren't true, why do people like the writers of my TV guides say it's scary? why why why? It's too boring to be scary.I suppose they do deserve some credit for pulling that off though, even I was fooled. But that's credit for the producers, not for the film itself. It's a shame actually that this rumour was done with this film, if it were done for a good film, movie history could have been made. What a waste.Then we come to the 'utterly horrifying' ending. Well actually, last time I checked, a man stood in the corner while a girl drops a camera isn't scary, but it looks like I'm wrong again. It's horrifying. I realise that at the start someone said that's what happened to a kid or something, but so what? It's still not scary.One of the (many) main reasons why this film isn't scary is that non of the characters are engaging, or even likable, the audience has no reason at all to like them, so why would we care if one of them has to stand in the corner? Even if it was frightening, who cares? For a good example of something horrifying happening to someone, see The Wicker Man. The Wicker Man did a good job of making itself scary because the character of Sgt Howie was portrayed as being likable so the audience could identify with him, and so when his time came, we felt empathy towards the guy, but what did we feel here? Absolutely nothing.In conclusion, The Blair Witch can be summed up in 5 no's.No effects No gore No shocks No stars NothingI give this trash 0/10. What? What do you mean I can't? Oh ok, fine, 1/10, but I'm being VERY generous. I even feel like upgrading every film I ever gave a 1/10 to a 2/10, just to emphasize how bad this was, but I can't be bothered.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the very few horror movies that really scared me to death,"I love The Blair Witch Project. It's definitely one of the best horror movies I've ever seen, but I understand why a lot of people hate it. It's actually a psychological horror movie, that what really scares you is your imagination rather than what is shown on screen (unlike 99% of the movies we see around). It's very slow burn but it isn't boring. Do not expect to watch a lot of action or jump scares. The first 20 minutes serves to build up the mythology behind the Blair Witch, and the remaining hour it's all about these 3 people lost in the woods. It sounds boring but it's not. The movie keep your attention because these people are interesting and they really look like real people, people you can relate to, you root for them to survive. There is also a creepy and claustrophobic atmosphere during the whole movie that keep you with fear. It all seems real. You never know what really is haunting this people, it is the witch or is something else? It really scared me and I'm not a easy person to scare. I can count in my fingers the movies that scared me and Blair Witch is definitely one of them, specially the ending... The last 10 minutes are unforgettable. Scary, disturbing, tense, heart beating, edge of your seat type of ending. It's really the most scary part and the last shot still kills me till this day. It's impossible to watch The Blair Witch Project and simply forget. You will think about the ending for a long time definitely. It's all very subtle and creepy. The Blair Witch Project is a classic and it deserves to be watched by every horror fan. If you want to get scared, this is it, trust me.

Brilliant,"""Let's not call it the captain anymore, you illiterate TV people. It's the skipper.""A groundbreaking ""found footage"" film, truly immersive, truly frightening. The premise is a trio of filmmakers heading into the woods to create a documentary about the local legend of the Blair Witch that dates back centuries. Locals tell them of several grisly murders and legends about the cursed woods, some of them believing, others not as much. The sense of realism created by the video footage the trio capture, most of it informal, is incredibly important in creating a sense of realism (and thus tension) for the viewer about what they later find out in the woods. Hell, I liked this even as a highly realistic view of the group dynamic as it goes from camaraderie to frustration over getting lost.When supernatural things begin occurring, they escalate with a sense of the relentless, starting with hearing branches snapping in the night and finding ritualistic things right outside their tent. Half the terror comes from not understanding exactly what this malevolent force is; the other half, from not having any ability to stop it or get away from it. ""There's no one here to help you!"" one shouts at another as they break down in different ways. It's a simple story but really quite a marvel, considering how unique it was from the other top films on 1999.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Some supremely chilling moments, but don't expect too much","After hearing all the (what I now believe to be) hype about this movie, I was very excited to see the preview.  While the movie was very inventive and very creepy at times, it's definitely a case of the whole being *less* than the sum of its parts.The story line, about the recovered video of three college film students lost in the woods while doing a documentary on local supernatural happenings, is inventive and provides plenty of goose-bump inducing moments. The three main actors all do an *excellent* job, and each scene in and of itself is interesting.  However, just because a scene is well done doesn't stop it from being repetitive, and too many scenes rehash something an earlier one has already covered.The video, both hand-held and 16mm show the students increasingly getting on each others nerves as it becomes clear they are lost, and documents their terror each night when they hear unexplained sounds (and eventually more) in the woods around them.  But there's only so many times I want to see them all losing it and yelling at each other.  The strength of the movie is in the eerie nighttime scenes, and we could have used less of daytime bickering and more of what the movie excelled at.  However each of these nighttime scenes didn't quite go far enough.  They were always chilling, but never truly frightening.I don't want to give away too much of the plot, because the mystery of what is happening, and what is going to happen is at the heart of this film. Suffice it to say that I was expecting more at the end than I got.  The last scene had me gripping the arms of my chair, absolutely riveted.  And then it ended.  Abruptly.  I think I can appreciate why the film's creators did the ending in the manner they did, but I was left wanting more.In the final analysis, the film doesn't draw together, it doesn't cohere in the way it needs to, and that is why its individual scenes, wonderful in and of themselves, don't quite create as wonderful a movie in total.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Did you hear something?,"If that phrase makes your ears perk up and your heart pound a little, then you are a candidate for Blair Witch.Lots of people have written, so just a couple of comments:Don't expect Kubrick-esque composition or a Ry Cooder soundtrack; just a little story that touches most people in the small secret part of their brain that remembers when humans huddled around a fire and hoped those noises in the distance would pass them by.

However, I think they have created an entertaining film, but its just not scary.The type of people who will think ""Blair Witch Project"" is scary are people who are afraid to watch programs that start off with: ""WARNING This program contains graphic images of a violent nature. It may not me suitable for all audiences.""I'm a big fan of the ""less is more"" school of thought, but this just didn't do it for me. I'll stick to Hitchcock and Rod Serling for that inspiration.Horror? NO WAY!!! Psychological Thriller? I think not! But entertaining: Yes.

I couldn't close my eyes.,"Admittedly, I didn't find the movie scary, probably because by today's standards it's pretty tamed.However, the things that really hold the movie together for me are the acting, the dialogue, and the realism.These are all no-name actors and they were all incredible! You really believed they were suffering. Heather was the stand-out for me. The scene where she gives her confession into the camera was very gripping.The thought and effort behind the film's presentation did an amazing job at making me think it was real.There were parts in this movie I did find unsettling.

The acting was horrendous, the script idiotic, and the plot nonexistent. I have never detested a film as much as this one, although Clerks did come close.

"A chilling, original, clever piece of film-making","The Blair Witch Project is a film that was slaughtered by hype and propaganda. When the previews came out it, the film was described as being the scariest movie ever made and it was compared to films such as The Exorcist. As a result, people went to see the movie expecting to be frightened out of their mind. In a lot of cases, the film had trouble living up to these expectations. I feel this film has been treated incredibly unfairly by the public because it is a very scary movie. You find a lot of people didn't like it because you never actually see the witch. Other people say there wasn't enough violence. I think this movie is very tastefully made and uses the art of subtlety to scare its audience. The scariest thing about the film is its intense realism and credibility. It seems so realistic. You can imagine it happening to you. If you haven't seen this movie, then go and see it for yourself.

This is supposed to be a horror film?!,"The trailers for this mega disappointment of a horror film inaccurately made it seem like it was going to be the scariest film ever made.

I think Jabba The Hutt in ""Star Wars"" scared me more than this film. It's basically just a tireless exercise in testing the viewer's patience in which a certain word that begins with the letter ""f"" takes up about half of the inept dialogue and many things go by unexplained thus confusing the viewer. It all has to do with some legend about some being called the ""Blair Witch"" that may or may not exist but long before the time this film ends the viewer probably won't care anymore anyway if it exists.

Well as a matter of fact the style wasn't new to anyone familiar with a particularly nasty 70's movie called ""Cannibal holocaust"", (only here thankfully no animals were hacked to tiny pieces by the immoral crew) and the movie itself is as scary as, well it's just not scary. It is in-fact very, very dull, I zoned out every five or so mins through total boredom. Toward the end it got a little interesting, then the end credits rolled, and that was that.

Really original.,"Great movie, maybe the first time audiences had been introduced to the found footage genre of horror.

Don't expect big dumb monsters running round the woods attacking our crew, the drama centres on the inner conflict of the leader with her team and how people begin to break down under pressure.

"Forget Hollywood formulas, big budgets and effects. Great film.","I remember hearing about the premise of this movie, and I was hooked long before I'd ever seen it. The premise of three college kids making a documentary about a witch, and then being hunted, is refreshingly original. I didn't need special effects. I loved the shaky camera work. It made the premise seem realistic.This is a love it/hate it type movie. Many people complain of the cheap production values. Well, the movie wouldn't have worked any other way. Another big complaint people have had is that they didn't understand the premise. They didn't know if it was supposed to be fact or fiction. WHAT,ARE YOU STUPID? I knew it was fiction from the get go. Do you think this would have escaped the news? Do you think the families involved would have allowed a mass-marketed movie to be released in the aftermath of their tragedies? Of course the movie was fiction. But, that didn't ruin a thing for me. I know that most every movie I see is fiction. That doesn't ruin my good time. And, with this movie, I was watching really good, really original fiction. I was glad to see a movie that didn't rely on millions of dollars of special effects. I was glad that we didn't see the money shot of the witch.This movie left me thinking of possibilities of what happened for weeks. It also worked on a level that truly scary movies like ""Rosemary's Baby"" worked. Both movies were truly scary because they dealt with real fears, with human emotion. Neither movies showed any graphic violence, but both were truly scary. They made me think about scary possibilities that can't simply be discounted. That kind of stuff is a whole lot scarier than a guy in a hockey mask. So, even to those who weren't able to give this movie a chance, go rent it and watch it in the dark on a quiet night.

Works better than the sleeping pill!,"Despite the obnoxious voices of the characters, this movie still does a better job than the sleeping pill does of putting one to sleep. In a nutshell, if you are entertained by watching characters stand around, complain, and act foolishly, then this movie is for you! Basically this movie is ENTIRELY about kids acting irrationally, complaining, and whining in the forest. Nothing happens to them, and they're all so annoying that you just hope they die. The first 99% of the movie could've been shrunk to a total time of 2 minutes (and even then it would still be a waste of film), and then the ending could've been made such that it wasn't quite possibly the biggest letdown in movie history.Nothing about this movie is scary at all. At the end, there is finally hope that the characters might all finally die and the movie will finally be over but nothing is resolved at all because you do not know what exactly happened. Actually, when I saw this movie, I thought that it was either a joke or a faulty tape or something because the end credits just sort of spontaneously popped up and started rolling. That is why this movie is such a big joke/scam. The entire movie is spent the viewer wanting something to happen (which is probably hoping the characters get killed), but nothing ever happens, not even at the end.Come to think of it, it's hard to even call this ""movie"" a movie. Why? Because there was no plot, terrible acting, no character development, no conflict (other than the absence of a medicine to cure stupidness), no resolution, no conclusion, and terrible cinematography. The only thing that this ""movie"" has in common with a real movie is that they both run on film.I must give props to whoever's idea it was to come up with this ""movie"". After all, right now he's probably rolling in cash. Throwing together a ""movie"", taking absolutely no care in doing so, and then marketing it such that people flock to the theatres to see it is a genius way to spend practically $0, but make millions. I should follow his example (except when I make my movie, I will actually take time and care and make a good plot).If you've ever seen a movie called ""Open Water"", this movie is exactly the same, only in this movie they're on land, there's more complaining, more stupid acting, and less of a plot. If 0/10 were an option, I would vote that for this movie in a heartbeat.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It looks and feels real....that's the scary thing about,"In Australia at midnight over 200 hundred people flocked the cinemas to be the first to see The Blair Witch. Alot of hype and anticipation was surrounding the movie and to me it lives up the hype!Never in my life have I seen a movie with such fear and unhappiness in someones eyes that it was enough to keep me awake all night.This movie was set around three student film makers who set out on a on - foot hike through the BLACK HILLS in Burketsville on a search for the Blair Witch formally known as Elli.It was a weekand journey planned out by director Heather Donahue , who was making a documentry about the Blair Witch. Little does she know she was filming her last days here on this Earth.Watching the movie without music or professional camera shots was a much more frightening way of watching three people being hunted by something unknown the camera. Every new shot something  different was saw or heard and as the nights dragged on, things became more scarier and more obvious.The ending was terrifying and left the audience speechless. The fact that these three students didn't know what to expect and weren't expecting anything that had happened to them for those five nights was the most real life encounting fear and angst that it felt incrediably real and terrifying to watch.I really really loved this movie and it is the best scary flick ever made.

I guess it takes more to spark my imagination than a carefully-constructed hype campaign and the inability to make the audience suspend disbelief. I fully wanted and expected to be scared and be swept away into the story. Alas, there was nothing to be scared of, and no story: only 3 kids screaming obsenities at each other. At no time did these characters make me think they were real. To anyone who thought this was a real documentary for a microsecond, I truly feel sorry for you. Never have I believed more strongly than now that film critics are just a bunch of group-think cretins, who use their pony-tails as antennas for the brain police to download ideas into their empty heads.

Why BWP's unconventional approach makes it a winner,"I was out of the country throughout June and July, and subsequently missed out on the advertising and hype for ""The Blair Witch Project."" After being extremely disappointed by ""The Haunting,"" I caved in to the word-of-mouth about BWP and decided to give it a try.I went into the theater not having seen the Sci-Fi channel documentary, not having seen a commercial, and not having been to the BWP website. I knew _nothing_ except that the story involved three college kids who go out to make a documentary about a witch.I am _never_ scared by horror movies. I nearly slept through Scream, and Friday the 13th movies don't do much for me either.Blair Witch had me sleeping with the light on.Why? Because you could _believe_ that the events on the amateur video were real. They _could_ happen. To you. The power of this movie lies in it's ability to make you _believe_ that something is after these kids. And this isn't Jennifer Love Hewitt or Courtney Cox being chased around, this is Heather, plain Heather, who cries into the camera and has a visibly runny nose and we can see how scared she is. She's real. She really looks cold and scared, and it's details like the runny nose that do it. As the days of the expedition pass by and the group gets more and more on each others nerves, the infighting, the stress, the blame, the spooked nerves, all of the dialogue and actions are things that you or someone you know would have done in the forest.I love Star Wars. I love digital sound. I love special effects. But this movie neither needed nor used any of them. It didn't have music. It didn't have the distracting, ill-used eye-candy visual effects if ""The Haunting."" This has the believable camera shakiness of somebody who knows there's something out there. They're shooting this on amateur video. It looks clunky. It looks cheap. This doesn't have the fine look of film, that refined look we're used to. This is gritty, seemingly real-world footage.Then there's the sounds at night that we've all heard outside the tent. And the possibility that there's a witch behind them. It's in the possibility, the ambiguity, that ""Blair Witch"" is masterfully done.That, and the last two minutes of the film, which I want a freeze frame for very badly. The last camera shot is one I'll not be forgetting for a long time.Those who've not seen BWP, read no further.Was there really a witch? Obviously there was a murderer, but was there truly effective use of witchcraft? Was it a spell that caused Mike to kick the map in the water, or did he really think it was that useless? Was it sorcery that made them come back to the same point in the river, or did they do as most humans do when walking without landmarks and walk in a huge circle? Was the slime on Josh's gear supernatural? Was that Josh's voice calling them to the house, or was it the The Murderous Old Man?We just don't know. At least, I don't, not until I see it again. And that's what makes this movie great. In real life, you really don't know if witchcraft is real- deep down inside, when we go camping at night we're slightly spooked by the snapping twigs or rustling leaves outside. And after having seen suspended effigies, ritual rock piles, and hands beating on the tent, we're all a little more willing to believe the unbelievable.It's this belief in the unbelievable that ""Blair Witch"" begins by poking fun at and slowly begins to nurture until, abruptly, it ends without giving an answer.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Can things that go bump in the night really hurt you?,"This movie chills and thrills. You bite your nails as you squirm in your seat. You want to be medicated in defense of the bouncy, jerky camera work. The sound engineer deserves a lot of credit for setting the moods and flow of this project. In the winter of 1994, three student film makers go into the woods near Burkittesville, Maryland to film a documentary about the legend of the Blair Witch. A year later, their interrupted video search is found. No trace of the trio; and now their disappearance becomes part of the mystery.  Unknown actors make this thing more believable. Heather Donahue was pretty darn good. Joshua Leonard and Michael C. Williams were her partners. The final sequence and last ten seconds in particular left me scared as hell. I had nightmares three nights in a row. Give it a chance. The non-professionalism makes fear more believable. Try it, you'll like it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Great concept...average movie.,"The concept for ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a great and original one. The hand-held, amateur, documentary, camera-work must give the viewers a realistic view of the events and tend to make the viewer believe that all of this really happened. It makes ""The Blair Witch Project"" an highly original one of a kind movie. Never again will there be a movie like this one.Most of the time the movie has a good realistic feeling and atmosphere. At times you really have the feeling that you're really present in the woods, together with the three main characters. Most of the lines and moments are obviously improvised however when scripted moments and lines occur, it becomes painfully obvious that none of the three main actors are good actors by any means. It takes away lots of the realism and because of that the good original concept is flawed. It's also flawed because it is highly unbelievable that the three main characters kept filming that much and even at the moments when they were in peril and scared.I do applaud this movie for its originality but it simply was not as good as I expected and hoped it would be. To be honest I was even bored at times while watching this movie and it takes a lot to make me bored while watching a movie. It simply took forever at times for something to happen.

Oh the humanity!,"First - I've been traumatized by every horror movie in the book. From Friday the 13th to Psycho, I've seen 'em all. That's why I was suckered into seeing this stinking pile of refuse laughingly called a movie. I was intrigued by the press the movie was getting, and it sounded like an interesting premise.An hour and a half later, I was disgusted that I had paid 7 bucks for this train wreck. No - even worse, I had paid the highest price of them all: two hours of my life savagely ripped away from me that I will never get back.Somewhere along the line, film goes have mistaken two hours of people on screen swearing at each other at the top of their lungs as character development, and running around in the woods non-stop as a plot. Half an hour of set up - and then an hour and a half of nothing - and then, the shock ending - where nothing happens. Have people's sensibilities been degraded by modern culture that they find this enjoyable?No monster/witch at the end. No pay-off whatsoever, at all - zip, nada, zilch! Now, I by no means have to have a full blown million dollar CGI special effect to scare the ever-lovin crap out of me. In fact, less is more - the most scary movies I can think of are where they never show, they simply suggest. However, the viewer needs **SOMETHING** to hang their hats on - a fleeting shadow of a great white shark under the water, a dripping claw on the Nostromo, a long shot of a man in a black jumpsuit in Haddonfield - something. What does the Blair Witch do? Make scary noises in the woods at night. Ooooh - hold me! Oh - and don't forget about those scary sticks and piles of rocks? I find scarier things in my breakfast cereal.Horror movies are frequently known for their plots - or lack of. Most of the time, this is true - a generic slasher flick often is a string of events loosely held together by a vague narrative. In the right mood, this can be even kind of fun, in a cheesy sort of way. However, the most cookie cutter Friday the 13th movie has more going for it in the coherent narrative department than this amateur attempt does. I was hoping for something more than ""Kids go into the woods to make a movie, kids get lost, kids run around for several days, kids die."" What the hell is that?!?After seeing the film, the next day at work  I was going off about it - and was instructed to go to blairwitch.com for the full back story. Surprise, surprise - guess what! There was indeed a full history on the legend, write ups on the characters, and more background information that I could hope for. If the creative (sic) team did all this work, then WHY THE HELL WAS NONE OF IT IN THE MOVIE?!?!? A viewer should not have to go do homework to get the complete story.Illogical plot devices abound. They get lost in the wood because ""I threw the f'ing map away, you stupid &!^@#^"" - a plot crowbar if I've ever seen one. Or how about ignoring common sense - even I, a city boy to the core, would know that if you follow a river downstream, you will eventually wind up SOMEWHERE! Anywhere - a road, a farm, the freakin' ocean, for god sake! Yet this simple concept eludes the characters (and I use the term 'characters' very loosely.). Or - the best one yet: if I woke up in the middle of the night, with the forces of evil shaking my tent like Lucifer himself was outside, I sure as hell would **NOT** grab my camera and keep filming as I ran. I would haul ass as fast as my legs would go - buck naked if need be. Yet they have the presence of mind to keep the film rolling? And what about that survival book that the filmmakers take great pains to point out in the beginning of the movie - and yet never shows up again?(Note to the creative (sic) team - next time, don't just make the movie up as you go.

I know it's a bold concept in this modern day and age, but your viewers will thank you for it.)For those of you who seem to have forgotten what a *truly* frightening and/or movie is, let me bring you up to speed on required viewing: Exorcist (the creepiest movie ever), Jaws (a film that traumatizes an ENTIRE generation of people, keeping them off the beach for years, has something going for it), The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Shining, Halloween, Night of the Living Dead, Ring (a classic Japanese horror film proving that terror is not exclusive to North America), Alien, and of course the granddaddy of them all - Psycho. Of course, all the sad people who have bought into the hype of the movie will call me closed minded and an idiot for not falling to my knees and worshipping this movie. Fine - whatever.

The weirdest friggin' movie I've ever seen...,"... and I've seen a lot of movies.  I, probably like many others out there, fell for the idea that this ""documentary"" was for real, and was creeped out to the max.  After reading stuff all over the web, I've come to the conclusion it's fake... ""just"" a movie.   It's all very realistic and scary stuff... I was just about to pack up and spend a weekend at Burkettsville hiking and looking for clues to the disappearances (carrying a gun, of course).  In any event, it's a very realistic movie, if a little weird.  It doesn't live up to the hype of being the scariest movie I've ever seen, or is even close, but it's cool to creep you out on a Saturday afternoon.  Enjoy!",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

We know we are going to get good horror films in the years to come but The Blair Witch Project will always be beside those at the top,"""In October 1994, three film student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland while shooting a documentary...."" ""A year later their footage was found"" This great quote in short tells the details of the Blair Witch plot. It is a plot that like most horror films can be questioned. How can the woods be the only setting? What is the purpose to this? Could it really work with only three cast members? Taking this all together, still The Blair Witch Project is something we could never have experienced or predicted what it was going to be.By using a small budget of only $20,000 to $25,000 aside from the opening shots, The Blair Witch Project is set only in the woods. The setting of the woods helps this film break the norm for horror movies. The woods here have a strange eerie feel, and is very original. You have the feeling along with characters of never getting out and no doubt it will you make at wilderness quite differently.With the small budget, the film only needs three cast members. Heather (Heather Donahue) is the only girl of the group and really emerges as the leader as they try to get out of the woods. Mike (Michael Williams) is a character who becomes very creepy once the harmful effects in the woods prey on him. Josh (Joshua Leonard) is the quiet member of the group in this bad situation. The cast really works due to the good acting by actors who are unknowns who we don't recognize making it realistic.After a plot and story that seems like it can't get much better, the ending is one that REALLY can't much better. The ending comes out of nowhere as again it is in the woods and in a place that seems like it's in the middle of nowhere. It is a heart-pounding and very scary ending. The final shot is very clever as there are different possible theories raised about what just happened. This is one of the best endings in movie history, no doubt.The Blair Witch Project is not normal horror. It is horror that goes way above the normal common ground and makes it's own mark on the movie world. We know we are going to get good horror films in the years to come but The Blair Witch Project will always be beside those at the top.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
You had to be there...,"Unfortunately this film falls foul to time.Hollywood has realised so much found footage (but nicely polished, found footage) over the last ten years that this film doesn't age well.

But I also don't understand the raving reviews.It was a great film if you take into consideration the promotion of it and that so many ""underage kids"" found a way to view it.Although I can imagine anyone above the age of 15 when they initially viewed it had already been subjected to much better horror, which I also nie have.This is a film that you really had to be there when it came out and it had to be one of your first experiences of horror.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Superb, one of the best horror movies of the 90's","THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT wound up the unfortunate victim of self-canibalization.  Artisan relentlessly marketed and merchandised what should have remained a creepy little curiosity destined for cult obscurity. While it made the company millions of dollars, the non-stop BLAIR WITCH hubbub destroyed the movie's staying power, at least with a wide audience.But maybe this movie should never have been seen by a wide audience.  Maybe the movie's advertising should have been word-of-mouth driven ONLY.  Maybe this movie should have never been released theatrically, at least not on a large scale.  Trying to appeal to a generation whose idea of horror is SCREAM, when the product you are selling is more along the lines of grittier horrors such as CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST or THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, is destined to ultimately fail.  Artisan may have made a killing, but they killed the movie in the process.BLAIR WITCH is one of the few movies I can think of that works better on the small screen.  When watching a grainy underground movie on TV, one feels they are seeing something subversive and taboo.  Seeing the very same thing on the big screen comes off as overly stylized, cinema-verite gone wild. This is largely due to the overuse of hand-held photography in commercials and on MTV--the very audience of which is whom BLAIR WITCH was directed toward.Now, mention THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and you'll hear, ""It sucked,"" ""It wasn't scary,"" ""Heather Donohue is an annoying bitch,"" ""The camera work was terrible,"" ""It was boring,"" ""I'm sick of it.""The last comment is the only one with any degree of validity.Anyone who did not find this movie even the least bit intense or eerie went into it determined to not let it affect them.  As far as the ridiculous criticism of Donohue's performance, her CHARACTER was indeed an annoying bitch.  She was obnoxious, loud, pushy and irritating.  In other words, her performance was perfect.Perhaps the dumbest of all the backlash against this movie were complaints about the shaky camerawork.  You see, it's really hard to sprint through the woods over uneven ground and retain a steady frame--especially when you may have forgotten you were even carrying a camera!  Found documentary footage is rarely very steady or polished, especially when it comes from the cameras of people being pursued by ghosts in the woods.In my personal opinion, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is a solid, creepy, intense, suspensful, entertaining thriller.  It moves along at a swift pace and manages a sense of anxiety rarely captured in American cinema, even during the early humorous scenes.  It's terror works much in the same way as David Lynch's TWIN PEAKS FIRE WALK WITH ME or Gasper Noe's IRREVERSIBLE--we know, to some extent, the protagonists fate at the beginning of the movie, so the entire story has a sense of dread and doom about it.I loved this movie.  Loved it.  There's nothing to read into it, nothing to figure out, nothing to ponder over.  It is what it is.  A good, scary shriek show.  They're a dying breed these days.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A classic,"I believe this film changed the industry because of the found footage style. I remember being in shock from the promotion because everyone thought people were actually missing before this movie came out.People might not find this film ""scary"" enough but they've clearly never been alone in the dark at night. The fear that the characters experience at night time is triggered mainly by the amount of stress that has built up during the day.Being followed by something you can't see IS TERRIFYING, simply as that. I repeatedly come back to this movie every year. It's inspired many films that we see today. It's a shame the ""remake"" didn't deliver as well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Pure class imo,"First of all I saw it only gets a 6+ on imdb, I can completely understand this, because this movie has a typical awsome or awfull feeling on people. Also I wanna say it's not a movie for film critics who judge on the story, directing etc..., it's not a movie like shawshank redemption or american beauty with an brilliant plot and meaning... This is a film to get u completely into the atmosphere of ""the unknown"", not a movie where the storie grabs u with your throat, the atmosphere, the feeling of being there yourself does this. Therefore many people will think it sux, because of the meaningless things you see on the screen. On the other hand I personally think this movie is pure class, the hype around it makes this movie certainly ""better"", just the thought ""did this really happened?"" grabs you, at least me. If u start watching the movie with the feeling of being unrealistic, fantasy etc... U will not enjoy it. Just sit back, and enjoy the amosphere of this awsome piece of independant filmmaking. It's original, thrilling, and its based on true facts. If u start watching the film with these three things in mind u will certainly enjoy it, others who take this movie down, are just not made for this. That's why it's an awsome or awfull movie.Well, I can say this movie is for me certainly an awsome piece of ""documentary""",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Blair Witch is as good as its viewer,"The Blair Witch Project is absolutely brilliant in that it affords each individual viewer his or her own film. Because the filmmakers allow us to imagine what we will during the films very creepy quiet and dark moments, we are frightened by that in our imaginations which truly scares us. A common movie ploy is to have some sort of demon use its victim's innermost fears against them. In this case, however, it is not only the characters undergoing this, but also the audience. The greater the viewer's imagination and the more willing the viewer is to give himself over to it, the more he will enjoy the Blair Witch Project.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Really good genre birthing horror,"The Blair Witch Project gets a lot of mileage out of its game changing concept and execution alone. It's all the better for being really short due to its deliberately chaotic construction and the low budget only helps to increase the terror towards the end, utilising the less is more effect even if some of it is by accident. The reason they keep filming is really smart even if the film just bluntly states it.Rei Hance, Joshua Leonard and Michael C. Williams all have a believable friendship early on which comes in handy when they spend the middle of the film constantly screaming at each other as that gets grating even if it's for a good reason. Rei Hance in particular, is really good at creating a palpable sense of fear as things really spiral out of control at the end and her eventual acceptance makes up for the middle part.Directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez wholeheartedly commit to the found footage elements, making the film the rare example of something being better on a small screen as camerawork this erratic on a cinema screen would undoubtedly be nauseating after a while. It's impressive what's been achieved on such a low budget and that also helps the horror because it relies on your own imagination to great effect.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Disappointing Film,"Foul language throughout the film that annoys. The idea of seeing a film as through a video camera is the most stupid. No scenery or spooky scenes.

I spent only 50p to rent this DVD and I think I wasted my time and money.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Imagination,"The problem with people who didn't like it is that they need to use their imagination to see this movie. The movie makes it out for you as a movie watcher to figure out who is doing it, what is going on, and what happened to those three. I will admit it scared the hell out of me. I have been in the woods, alone, at night and I have heard things (i.e. children laughing) and it isn't fun. If this movie was out 50 years ago, it would have made more because today's society is waiting for the 'jump' like horror movies and that isn't what this movie was.

Found Footage That Actually Works,"The Blair Witch Project is a unique one for me - imho it is the only movie that relies on the found footage technique and actually works.

An idiotic exercise in independent filmmaking,"Man...this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I have never seen the movie as bad as the 80s Z-grade movies I watched on USA Up All Night. I'd rather sit through Guccione's integrated version of Calibula than endure this nauseatingly mindless trash again.The Blair Witch Project is the epitome of the independent filmmaking method that gleefully indulges in the four-letter word to cover up the fact that whenever the dialogues and ideas fizzle out, there always come the obligatory obscene and vulgar language in practically every line of dialogue to make up for the lack of substance and quality. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with the level of profanity as long as the movie is interesting and balanced. But this movie went so far as to get on my nerves and made me so angry I wanted to unleash the fury on the videotape as soon as it ejects from the VCR after the movie ends.The reason why BWP was made is simple: two amateur filmmakers kicked around the idea, recruited the young people and loaned them with the cameras to go into the woods to make a psychologically scary movie. The result is a mind-numbingly tedious exercise in self-indulgence and bad attitude all the way. This is the reason why I found the movie less scary and more irritating. Heather was so gratingly annoying I wanted to kill her onscreen. I literally had to beg for Joshua and Michael to die quickly and painlessly because they holler and scream and cuss at each other ALL THE TIME after the first half hour. At least they deserve the fateful death in the movie, but the fact that never cease to amaze me is that the so-called actors who relies on improvision comprising mostly of ""J***s C****t! F**k! S**t!"" are still alive and kicking.What astounds me is that this overblown, overhyped and overrated film made big bucks at the B.O. and the filmmakers are laughing all the way to the bank. I hope and pray that they (and the filmmaking duo and the Artisan execs) will never work in Hollywood again because of this travesty that undermines the importance of reasonable quality and instills the repetitive use of the F-word and the abuse of the Lord's (whoever the Lord is, depending on your view and belief) name legitimate to make the product even more compelling.

"I didn't felt like this in a long, long, time...","Well, what can i say about the movie that scared me the most in the last 5.000 years? :)I guess that by now everyone has heard of it... some people liked it, some don't. I'm one of those that loved it.First, the movie has this ""feeling"" of reality, that convincing look, that strange resemblance with the everyday people and live. I found that kind of ""ambience"" in only one more feature: The Simpsons TV series, although for completely different reasons.In the Simpsons, i think that the sounds and the voice acting were extremely reality-inducing.In TBWP, every part of it (picture, sound, acting, improvising) transpires a strange sense of real life happenings, that no special effects can buy...The movie is quite slow for some time, i must admit. But thats part of its ""magic"": the viewer must be given the change to ""relate"" with the characters, to know then, to care for them.I think that it didn't work for some people, but then again, some people loved Holywood's Godzila, which show us that we are all different from each other... :)Anyway, the last 20 or 15 minutes are the most dense and mind blowing piece of movie that i've seen for quite some time... i actualy got scare a couple of times, even though we don't see much ""explicities"" on the screen. Its our own mind that scare us.Just to finish this lenghty review, i would like to say that the ending is just p-e-r-f-e-c-t, a wonderfull climax to those last 20 minutes of adrenaline and worries.My advice?

The Blair Witch Project,"The film's main strength lies in its authenticity, in its impressive restraint and the actor's efforts, and how much intelligence and storytelling was hidden in a movie that looks so raw and authentic.

A very intense movie for people who can appreciate what it tries to accomplish.,"Something that so much of the horror genre lacks is realism. While ""classics"" like A Nightmare on Elm Street do nothing but bash you over the head with a block of cheese, they get positive reviews because they follow the same tired, safe formula that make the horror fans go in their pants due to nostalgia. The majority of the horror genre isn't really scary, and it never was. When The Blair Witch Project first came out it was the only movie to break these rules and delve into true, realistic terror. It didn't follow a formula. It tried to recreate the terror of someone lost in the woods on film, without the cheese or eye candy. I think that is why it captivated me. I've seen thousands of movies in my life, the majority horror movies, and maybe less than 5% really scared me. I'm not sure The Blair Witch Project scared me, but, I can say I felt the terror in the characters and script more than the vast majority of the other horror movies I've seen combined.But there is another factor it seems no one is mentioning in their reviews. If you've never been lost in the woods, as I've been many times, I'm not really sure you could appreciate or understand the fear that the characters were feeling. If you're not a camper, I really doubt you'd like this movie whatsoever. A lot of the negative reviews from people calling this ""stupid"" or ""boring"", I can understand if they've never been lost in the woods. This is NOT a film everyone will like, or should like, and that is something someone really needs to say.Because I'm reviewing this in 2008, not 1999, I'm going to have to add that this movie is not like Cloverfield whatsoever. Cloverfield was a huge adventure caught on a small camera, while this is a small adventure caught on a small camera. If you liked Cloverfield (or vice versa) and are looking for a similar experience, this isn't it. They're both good movies, but for very different reasons.The main flaw that a lot of people are having a problem with is the pacing, which is reasonably slow. The reason for this is because it is meant to echo real life, not bash you with an explosive beginning like is typical Hollywood. Some will find this boring. Some won't because they appreciate realism. I fit into the latter.Overall, a very intense movie . . . if you know how to understand it. I found it very enjoyable and lacking of the typical horror cheese, which is something I can't say much anymore. Very much worth watching. You are not a real horror fan if you haven't at least viewed this once, because it's unlike anything that has ever been made before it.3/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Someone did their Hitchcock homework....,"Why do people find this movie scary and others do not?  Having spent many of my years watching all sorts of horror movies, I can say that this movie is very eerie and scary, even more so than most of the movies from the last two decades.First off, the propaganda around the movie sets up that these events really happened, so people see the movie the way many would have watched the OJ trial or the JFK assassination...they weren't there for a movie, they went to see a documentary, so they were a bit freaked to begin with.  It also helped the realism along that it was filmed by the actors on video cameras.Plus, they never show you the Blair Witch, and folks, that's spook genius right there.  Rent any number of Alfred Hitchcock's films, and you may see a parallel.  What you don't see will scare you more than what you do see. When we watch a Jason or Freddy movie, we are relieved when they come on screen, because we can stay in that ""it's a movie mindset.""  But by not seeing the witch, you mind can't find that mindset as easily, leaving it to your imagination, which can raise your pulse just a little more than normal.And yes, the movie is slow, but that's part of the whole point.  It builds to the climax we see at the end, taking us on a ramp of anxiety, rather than the up and down formula of a slasher movie.  Boring? At first, yes.  Dull? Only if you aren't paying attention...Take it for what you will, I see a great addition to the horror genre.

It unfortunately let me down.,"I had been eagerly waiting to see this for a month or two now.

My number 18 movie,"The Blair Witch Project is my number 18 movie. It is a great horror flick, at least if you see it on the big screen, and it was something very new. When I saw this movie in cinemas back in 1999, I was not that impressed. But when I was home again, alone in my room and heard any noise downstairs, I started liking it.After having seen Blair Witch Project, camping will never be the same. It is the same with surfing after Jaws.The thing I HATE about Blair Witch  is that there was a sequel. The sequel still is the worst piece of cr*p I have ever seen in my entire life. I recommend watching Blair Witch Project either in cinemas, or alone in a dark room. This film includes unbelievable psycho-terror, at least for me. I read many comments who claimed that this just was not scary, but it was. There have been scarier movies, definitely ( The Exorcist, The Sixth Sense, It ), but this is at least in the Top 10 of the scariest movies ever. You just have to want it to be scary. I am glad that I love this movie, since so many people did not.Good points : acting, directing, authentic camera work, story, ENDINGBad points : sequel, too short, there could have been more shock effects ( there were just some, but those were very shocking )All in all, I rate this movie 9.8/10 and recommend watching it alone in a dark room.If you have any questions, feel free to ask them.CU; Rinho.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not exactly a masterpiece.,"It goes without saying that we fear that which we don't know. And in ""The Blair Witch Project"", we sure as hell don't know what's out there. It's only the three filmmakers growing more and more scared. I will admit that I didn't find this movie to be as great as most people thought, but it does send a shiver down your spine, just because you don't know what's out there. I would never have wanted to go out into the woods alone to begin with, and now I really don't (although I don't believe these legends about spooks in the woods). Either way, this was an unprecedented movie when it came out - especially since it out-grossed flicks like ""Eyes Wide Shut"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Simple, annoying, frightening!","This was one hard to watch movie.  I am a person who immerses myself in the story.  I don't turn the movie on the first time and begin my critique as many here have done. First watch it, then, later, return and blast it if you must.  I loved it. The idea is unique. The style is the annoying part, but, that is one of the things that makes this movie.  I found myself so wrapped up in this thing that I was yelling at the stupid characters in the film.  All they had to do was follow the creek down stream.. it is any woodsman's guaranteed method for getting ""un-lost"" (especially in slightly rural Maryland). What I enjoyed most was the intelligence of the director.  He didn't play the Hollywood game of showing us the horrifying monster.  Instead he let our minds do the work.  If you have imagination, you'll be frightened to death.  If you don't, you'll fall asleep or get motion sickness.  This was so much fun that I made my own, cheaper yet, spoof, and mine is funny, at least to me!  Enjoy and be brave.. not everything on screen has to be so glossy and predictable as a big budget Hollywood bore!",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Interesting, but far from being very scary at all...","Some of the best horror movies are those that imply rather than explode, hint at rather than expose. Fear is scarier than scariness itself--scary is just scary. Fear is fear. And fear induces all else that follows. Fear gets you on the edge of your seat; fear makes the hairs on your neck stand up. The scare comes afterwards.The movie is false, but knowing that ruins the surprise of it all. Three amateur filmmakers--two guys and a girl (where's the pizza place?)--go into a Maryland wood, in hopes of uncovering the secret of the infamous Blair Witch, a legendary witch who is rumored to live in the woods. First they interview town folk and get their sworn testimonies. An old, apparently crazy woman insists that the Blair Witch appeared next to her in a lake once and was covered with beastly hair. (That sent chills up my spine.)Then they embark into the woods, equipped with video cameras and recording everything. But soon they get lost--the map is pointless. They just keep going in circles. They walk around the woods for days, every night hearing strange sounds outside their tents and finding mysterious wooden ornaments hanging in a graveyard.""The Blair Witch"" project is smart enough to know this, but that is about all I can credit the film for. It's that type of fear-inducing, thought-provoking horror movie not made since the likes of ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Omen,"" but when I was done watching it I realized that it hadn't really scared me at all. It had me thinking, yes, and it had me interested throughout, but it didn't scare me. After all the fear had settled there was no scare left. I viewed the film with all the lights in the room turned off, and yet it still didn't scare me. In fact, I found it to be rather ridiculous at times.But it is an admirable horror film, one that uses ancient techniques as opposed to chainsaw-wielding villains with ski masks chasing groups of very, very stupid, mentally under-developed big-breasted teenage bimbos around a house for hours in the dark, jumping out at the camera whenever we've gone too long without a jolt. No, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is all about insinuations and the unknown. I'll admit that the film is pretty darn creepy, if ineffectively scary. At one point, a group of three teenagers are asleep inside a tent, lost outdoors in a Maryland woods, when loud screams start coming from somewhere out there.They rush outside with the video cameras jolting about frantically. I was waiting any second for some ghostly pale figure to be seen far off in the woods.Which is part of my disappointment in the film. To unexpectedly catch a glimpse of something--the witch, the ghost of the murderer, anyone and/or anything--would have been terrific. To expose something ever so briefly so that you think, What was that? and try to play back your videotape again to pause the image.But the film doesn't ever really approach the Blair Witch. Furthermore, it never really explains anything by the end of the film. And I understand that this is the appeal of the film for most people. BUT...I'm not asking to show the Blair Witch chasing them around. All I would have liked to see was at least an ever-so-brief glimpse of some unintelligible being. That would have been far spookier, because eventually you get to the point while watching the film when you realize it isn't going to show you anything, and you start to lose interest.This movie sent chills up my spine and made the hairs on my neck stand up at certain points. This is my kind of horror movie--I'm not into the slasher flicks, primarily because I do not find them very scary at all. I'd rather have the images of the attacker lurking in the dark left up to me, not jumping forward at the screen.Am I contradicting myself? I say I do not want to see the Blair Witch, but yet moments later I say I do. No, what I want to see is some effervescent being illuminated in the dark ever so briefly; it would be the ultimate spine-tingler. Remember in ""Signs"" how M. Night Shyamalan showed the alien walking across the driveway at a birthday party? Remember how you weren't expecting it, how sudden it was? How quick? I would have liked something like that--just something very quick and very, very spooky. Not even as detailed as the alien--some far away being standing in the middle of the woods, who suddenly disappears with a shriek. (So that you never really see it at all, you just see the light and think, What was that?)The craving of seeing the attacker is part of the fun. In this case, my craving was never fully satisfied.4/5.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Don't let the subtlety throw you,"As a straight horror movie, if that were all there was, I didn't find it terrifying. Supremely tense, definitely, particularly in the scenes without light; and when reflecting on it afterwards the full impact of its chilling nature hit me more. It doesn't provide the shockfest that horror audiences want the most, though. However, I found it excellent as a psychological thriller. We get to watch as three ordinary people, complete with ordinary flaws that make them all the more believable, are exposed to extreme stress with inevitable consequences. Watching them break down, culminating in an incredible monologue by Heather, is a fascinating experience. The realism is also top notch; while others might decry the lack of any kind of polish, I reckon it's just that that makes it so intriguing. It could easily be real life that's being filmed, a premise aided by the very natural acting of the three main characters. Eerie, unsettling and very effective in its subtlety, this ranks as one of my favourite films and well worth watching.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A good & creepy modern fright flick.,"""The Blair Witch Project"" can be seen as a movie along the lines of 1978's ""Halloween"": it may not be original stuff (think ""Cannibal Holocaust"", made approximately two decades before this movie, in this case), but it certainly popularized its particular sub genre, the ""found footage"" sub genre, for better and for worse. This marvel of marketing deserves its props for one main reason, and that's the way it uses its low, low budget to its advantage, placing all of its horrors squarely inside the heads of its viewers, forcing them to use their imaginations to conjure up their own demons. The story hardly needs summarizing by this point, but suffice it to say that it presents itself as the ""real"" footage of three student filmmakers who get lost in the wilderness of Maryland while investigating a local legend. What this viewer has to say, in his own personal experience, is that repeat viewings have helped him to appreciate it more than he used to. A large part of the appeal is the *very* rural setting, and the idea of being lost in this setting and having no idea where to go, possibly ending up going in circles, which would be an extremely distressing thought. Now, the largely improvised dialogue is no great shakes, but it does offer a realistic enough account of the way that humans under extreme stress may very well speak, alternating between sniping at each other and trying to bolster each others' spirits. Our three protagonists, played by Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael Williams, aren't entirely unsympathetic. The directors slowly increase the sense of menace throughout, with the last act naturally registering as the creepiest. Interview sequences at the beginning are definitely amusing. The arts and crafts displayed by our unseen antagonist(s) are genuinely striking, and do lead to my favorite line in the film: ""Rednecks aren't this creative!"" Of course, the idea in this film of one character stubbornly insisting on documenting *everything* has already become a cliché; while of course we wouldn't have the movie if this person weren't doing so, it's all too easy to understand how this would annoy other people. Overall, I realize I have been under-rating this for years (watching it late at night or early in the morning with all the lights off would create the perfect effect) - it does have good atmosphere - although *that* scene has always cracked me up, and that was before I even saw ""Scary Movie"". In the end, it does appear that assessments of ""The Blair Witch Project"" usually do tend to rely on how one reacts - either it works for the viewer or it doesn't.

"Unimaginably boring, dull and imbecilic...","Let me make myself perfectly clear from the start:  I went into this movie with *NO* expectations whatsoever.  I had no exposure at all to the hype. My younger brother told me how terrible this movie was, but I thought it must have *some* redeeming value -- in fact, it sounded interesting.  After seeing it, I realized that it had no redeeming value.  It was bad, bad, bad. Dull.  The fact that I made it all the way through without turning it off is a minor miracle.Another thing -- I'm not at all lacking in imagination.  I love atmospheric films.  I've felt a creepy sensation being in the woods before (although I usually just feel peaceful) and was terrified of the dark as a child (I got over it!)  But the fact is, this movie had no atmosphere.  It had no acting (though plenty of ridiculous overacting).  It had no plot.  It had no cinematography.  No directing.In fact, this wasn't a movie at all.  I don't know what it was... I don't...I know... it had to be a farce!  I get it now... someone posted several hundred positive reviews using different names on the IMDB, trying to get people to watch it.  Must have been whoever released the film.  The production company must have been in on it.Honest... how else to explain why ANYONE would consider this dull, meaningless piece of junk?  I feel very cheated that I wasted the money to rent this on DVD.  I would feel cheated if someone offered (and paid) me fifty dollars to see it again.The only film of ANY genre I've seen that was worse was ""The Telephone"" (Whoopi Goldberg).  This film goes down as #2 on the bottom 10 films I've ever seen.Long after the release of this piece of trash, I remain utterly baffled that anyone with an IQ over 25 (or under 25, for that matter) would see any redeeming value in this film.

Your reaction will depend on your imagination,"If you have a rich, vivid imagination and a fascination with the subject matter, I think you'll enjoy this. This movie was somewhat of a pre-reality era movie in that I don't remember any other cinema movie of this style being popular before, and certainly not hyped as having real footage. I do not understand how an adult or even a teenager could be naive enough to believe this footage was real, but I guess that added to the thrill for many.Without question, not actually showing everything built suspense and mystery. The entire film would have collapsed like a house of cards if they had introduced a green skinned woman with a pointy hat at the end (LOL). Instead, we got a very cool ending. Along the way, you'll have to endure some overbearing acting by the female lead, but overall, this is worth watching at least once. You probably won't feel the need to watch it again after that for quite a long time, but it is an enjoyable experience nonetheless. It unfortunately typecast the actors (especially the female lead) forever as ""that guy/girl in Blair Witch"", but the men who made this film undoubtedly had no need to ever work again after this (budget $60,000 for a gross of $248 million, you do the math..).

Over-hyped but fresh and scary,"In the woods outside of Burkittesville, Maryland a legend exists about the Blair Witch who supposedly killed many children in the 1940's.  A trio of film makers decide to go into the woods for their student project to document what they find in comparison with the legend itself.  They go missing.  A year later their footage is discovered and pit together to reveal what they went through when they became lost in the woods.  This film is the footage they recorded.There is no doubting that hype was both the making and breaking of this film.  The hype got this small, no-budget film into multiplexes world wide where otherwise it wouldn't have got in the front door.  However the hype also raised expectation so that people were expecting the horrors to end all horrors etc.  Viewed without any hype this would have been so much better  but on a wave on such expectation few things can avoid coming down a bit.Outside of this the set up is very good  put forward as true.  The way the film starts by mixing interviews with recollections of the legend etc gives us enough information to join the trio on their journey.  The film then begins to journey into the woods and the tension build nicely as we share some of the group's fear.A lot of this comes down to the cast  they all start cheerful and young but as they go on they do seem genuinely tired and scared  this helps us believe.  The hand held cameras add to the realism but also put us right there with the group (if also means we don't see things but the fear comes from what's outside of eye line).Now the film is very basic but in many ways that helps it.  There is no hidden subtext, no baggage  just things going downhill.  The film ends in the most basic way and is good for it.  While it may not be the most scary thing ever seen, it is refreshing to se a horror film that isn't another cliché ridden slasher flick.Overall it may be overhyped and be suffering from a certain amount of backlash, but this is a very sharp, tight, clever and scary little film.

You Had To Be There...,"I had noticed that the IMDB ratings have dropped since the last time I checked in and it's obvious there's a divide between modern critics and/or a generations of movie go-ers.It's an awful shame because the budget for marketting this movie is phenomenally creative as it was a ""word of mouth"" or ""virality"" as some would say. The creative team made a full on universe of a supernatural element happening in the real-world and was publicized as such. There were mockumentaries all over the television and internet before the movie was released saying it was ""authentic found-footage"" making this a ""snuff"" film.The lore in the documentaries almost make it must-see so that what happens in the film chills you to the bone as it all starts coming back to you. The acting in the documentaries are very convincing too as they had many talented people fabricate a mythological story that never existed.Cannibal Holocaust and the Last Broadcast came before this and are equally great faux found-footage films. All 3 should be praised.It's just an awful shame that this movie suffers because, during the giant influx of young youtubers reviewing films will never know the terror of the unknown questioning conventional human standards.The acting is entirely improvised with small clues by the crew harassing them at night and taking away their food for 8 days.

Daringly Original....Extremely Terrifying,"The Blair Witch Project, set an example for many movies to come.  With a budget of only 36000, this film was able to create a horrifying film.

As their curiosity thickens, however, they find themselves lost in the forest of the Blair Witch.  Over the next few days, they realize that they may never find their way back, and gradually their optimism disappears.  The amazing part about this movie is how they are able to frighten you without even showing the Blair Witch, or having the villain pop out and scare you.

"Original, yes, but WAY over-hyped","I concede that 'The Blair Witch Project' is one the most original horror movies in modern cinema, yes, and that it is completely worthy of praise. What I can not understand though, is the overwhelming plethora of critical gushings such as that from 'Mr. Showbiz' calling it ""the scariest movie ever made.""  Does the distributor Artisan Films have these people on the payroll??Sans the thought-provoking conclusion I never got the sense of sheer terror I've experienced in such horror-fare as 'Halloween' or 'The Shining.'  One ostensible source of the audiences' sense of doom in this film comes from the fact that the 3 documentarians can't find their way out of the Maryland woods and somehow every step leads them to where they were days before. Their surroundings begin to look alike.  This would normally be effective in underground catacombs or in a haunted house where an evil force could conceivably manipulate the environment, but if you're in the woods there are some subtle clues which can be used to ensure you're not going in circles. Did it ever enter these peoples' minds to, say, oh I don't know, FOLLOW THE STREAM or USE THE SUN??I shouldn't be too harsh even though it's probably too late.  Given their $30,000 budget the filmmakers have created quite an achievement (the premise alone was brilliant) and given this economic allowance, the film is impressive.

Among my favourite horror flicks but not for all tastes,"When ""The Blair Witch Project"" was released in 1999 it was a big hit and a breath of fresh air. It wasn't the first horror movie based on the supposed footage of ill-fated documentarians but mainstream audiences hadn't seen anything like it. The premise here is amply summed up by the film's tagline: 'In October of 1994 three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland, while shooting a documentary... A year later their footage was found.'The story is a good example of 'less is more' storytelling. True, the plot does involve a fair amount of aimless wandering through the woods but those scenes are crucial in the give and take of suspense where each night could be their last. There were a couple of instances when I thought that the script could have benefited from just a little less information (thus ratcheting up the mystery) but the film still shows plenty of restraint and, consequently, skillfully manipulates our fear of the unknown.Meanwhile, the cast of unknowns does a pretty good job of seeming like regular people rather than actors. There may be a few occasions whereby the emotions don't quite ring true but for the most part the actors are sufficiently convincing. They also perform double duty as cameramen, helping to enforce the film's sense of realism with mostly lo-fi visuals.In the end, though, this is one of those films that most people will either love or hate. I think that it's definitely worthwhile but your mileage may vary. By the way, don't bother with the sequel; it's awful.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Same as most people they don't believe in those myths but as strange things start happening during their trip they become more and more terrified of the trees surrounding them.The way that The Blair Witch Project scares you is nerve wracking and the way it creates suspense and horror is genius. You become terrified of what might be in this forest and an oppressive feeling fills your body as you watch these three young filmmakers wandering around in the pure terror of these woods.
What you feel when watching this movie and how it gives you this feeling is very hard to express in words since it scares you in its very own way. Mostly it is the fear of the unknown which makes this movie so extremely scary for me.I want to greatly recommend this movie to anybody who is even only in the slightest bit interested in horror, because The Blair Witch Project managed to give me a kind of fear that no other horror movie could give me yet. And if you watch it, you will never forget about the truly horrifying ending of this fantastic movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Time is the Blair Witch's worst enemy.,"After it all dies down, I'm thinking how lucky I was not to have jumped to have scored this film when the tide of passion and hype was at it's highest.When it came out I guess I would have scored it alot higher. I've now watched it three times. The third time seemed so very, very long to be made sea-sick whilst watching three people I really wasn't made to care about run around like headless chickens and make me wish I could climb inside the film and slap some sense into them, or just sit them down and tell them to get a grip.If anyone asks me to watch it again I'll probably just stand in a corner.The sequel might stand the test of time better though.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the worst films ever made,"Billed as a movie that was said to be ""SCARIER THAN THE EXORCIST."" You've got to be kidding me!!! Scary?!?!??! To who?? The little 15-year old teenyboppers with their In Sync and Back Street Boys t-shirts?? Scary!??!?!?? You've got to be kidding me. This is supposed to be a horror movie ""SCARIER THAN THE EXORCIST!??!?!?!"" To the critic that said that, I'd like a hit of the crack pipe that you were smoking. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is perhaps one of the worst films I've had the displeasure of viewing. I saw this in the theater the first night it opened surrounded by little 15 and 16 year old teenyboppers who shouldn't even be allowed in R-rated movies. Don't theaters enforce this policy anymore?? This movie is extremely boring and it drags on way too long. The jumping camera made me nauseous and I was ready to walk out. Fortunately, the film mercifully ended to a loud chorus of boos. Perhaps one of the most overrated films in American cinema history. Don't waste your time on this. The three main actors are annoying, the story is lame and boring.

Felt I should offer my first IMDb comment,"I saw TBWP on a Saturday afternoon showing, and I wasn't scared that night..or the next night really. Then, tonight (Monday night) I looked it up here and started reading the comments. After the first 20 or so, I felt the need to turn on the lights around the computer and started making sure that the doors were locked. This movie isn't the typical group-of-teenagers-find-a-slasher-and-get-killed-off-one-by-one-until-the-most-annoying-one-is-left (see any of the interminable Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street movies for that). The film itself isn't even scary in the traditional sense, but prefers to take the eerie route. Blood is replaced by  far off sounds that could be one of many things. Body parts are replaced by mysterious (in the case of the stone piles, not so mysterious) symbols.  The final 10 minutes is probably the scariest 10 minutes I've spent in a movie theater. To my mind, is is a classic psychological thriller that shows what happens to a small group of people trapped in an unknown situation with no obvious signs of escape. The naysayers I've seen on IMDb seem to have a couple of major sticking points. One, they say, is that the script is contrived.  Sorry folks, but according to most all reports I've read there WAS no script. The 3 actors were dropped into the middle of a forest with a couple of cameras and a finite supply of food. They were told to shoot their travels through the forest, and then at night the crew would attempt to scare the crap outta them . Their reactions on the screen is the real thing.  The only real plotted out point is not following the stream to civilization. The plot and dialogue show that they were following their compass in one direction with little or no deviation, yet still arrived back at the log crossing the stream. Therefore, the supernatural seems to have set in, and it wouldn't have mattered if they had followed the stream, they would have ended up at the same point anyway. To me, the only thing I might have done differently was (after the first strange occurrances) I would have slept during the day and walked during the night with EVERY SINGLE LIGHT I could find blasting. That's just me, though. All in all, the movie was a great film, and was given (during my showing, anyway) the highest accord a horror movie can be granted: when the movie ended, the theater was completely silent. Everyone was too drained to talk about the movie until they were back into the safety of the daylight.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
An interesting experiment,"Designed to provide the ultimate scary experience, ""The Blair Witch Project"" severely criticizes ""objective"" shots and filmmaking. There are only two 3 seconds-long takes that could be considered objective and not character perspective.You never experience ""plastic"" terror in this movie. You do experience the horror of being ""inside"" of it. And, of course, your stomach experiences the horror of a camera that is constantly moving.I assume we will be seeing more experiments like this one, not necesarilly in horror movies. I can't imagine a James Bond movie shot this way, but, time will give an answer.Give it a try.

"Not as bad as you think, but definitely suffers from a lack of plot","Weird and interesting, The Blair Witch Project is an interesting but sadly missed opportunity with improvised dialogue and quite frankly, an annoying film crew, and a definite lack of answers. It can be interesting, the mythology, the theorys, but it otherwise falls very flat, and can be a hard film to get through, even with it's fairly short runtime. Though it can be scary, and does feels like it could be shot on a modern cell phone, it lacks the substance of a modern horror film. Not great, not interesting, you watch it once and you pretty much understand it and move on to another horror film.

Scaring Yourself,"Allow me to offend some people by theorizing about the reason for the huge disparity in how people respond to the Blair Witch Project. Personally, I fell on the side that found it less scary, less interesting, and less exciting than watching grass grow.People who have actually been in the woods before, and have some shred of self control, mental stability, and the ability to think rationally, will find it impossible to relate to the characters, and impossible to share in their terror. If, on the other hand, you were raised as a spoiled, emotional moron, whose experience of nature consists of occasionally flipping past the nature channel with your cable remote, the movie might scare you ... not because it's actually scary, or because anything actually happens in the movie, but because your own imagination might manage to scare you all by itself. To be blunt, I really cannot fathom any other reason for anyone to think this was a scary movie ... unless they have an extreme phobia of twigs tied together. Sorry.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

This is the future.,"While many deride this film as empty, or less than entertaining, the fact remains, like it or not: This is the future of filmmaking. Period.If you hate or loathe this film, all I can say is: do it yourself, do better. Like it or not, the makers of BWP have pointed the way. Anyone with access to a digital camera, computer and a simple editing program has the capacity to make a film.This particular piece, so roundly trashed by many, does have its own, odd, quirky points, moments that stand out and are now part of the horror iconography.While the detractors moan and groan, a simple tale from my own experience explains why I love this odd little thing.One of my supervisors overheard me enthusing about BWP. He chided me, as I am sure so many others will, about how ""bad"" the film was, how ""stupid"" and simply not scary. He went on in detail, and I responded simply ""to each their own,"" or some such. A few seconds afterwards, though, he pulled me aside and asked:""It wasn't ... REAL... was it?""See, one of the greatest things about BWP is its simplicity.Once upon a time, two boys and a girl went into the dark forest, and were never heard from again.The stuff whispered around campfires, or cautionary tales told by grandmothers to correct the unruly child... the power is in the simplicity.Would that Hollywood could see the point... but I fear they are blinded to it... I have hope, though, because, as mentioned above, this is the future, I have the technology, and I can do it myself, should I so choose... I would invite anyone that hates this film to see if they can do better, not so much as a throw down challenge, but rather as a simple desire to see what others can do with such limited resources.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Effective, but also taxing and cacophonous","The Blair Witch Project is undeniably inventive, but its success relies heavily on a particular allure and the audience's goodwill. The trick that directors Myrick and Sánchez try to pull is all about their creative format, which they employ manipulatively and cleverly, with a hint of flair. The three leads were given just one day's worth of script at a time, improvising their way through the story with only a 35-page outline to guide them, and with minimal information about the roles of the supporting characters they encountered. Indeed a refreshingly bold approach to filmmaking, but the novelty of it all is no guarantee for success. The documentary-style camerawork ensures a raw, realistic effect, but it's not without risk. It's easy to overdo it - and The Blair Witch Project occasionally wears thin, becoming static and grating. The idea of unrefined handheld footage isn't exactly new (just ask Cannibal Holocaust), and while it can be effective, it's also taxing, cacophonous.The horror in The Blair Witch Project is meant to feel immediate and visceral. Instead, the supernatural elements often fall flat, unable to blend seamlessly with the documentary style. The film's middle part drags, weakening the suspense that the finale desperately needs to work. Myrick and Sánchez need you to stay engaged, not exhausted, but Blair Witch ultimately tires you out. That said, the global buzz that this film has garnered is positive for maintaining artistic balance in cinema. Although this is no masterpiece, it has attracted renewed interest for the medium and this particular genre. Kudos to Robert Redford's Sundance Festival for taking a chance on it, and hats off to the young filmmakers for pushing boundaries. Like Lynch's Eraserhead, The Blair Witch Project is a fascinating piece, even if it's no stroke of genius.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One benefit from this movie,"The only thing I can truly be thankful for is, perhaps, the horror genre will finally move away from the hack & slash gore which has flooded the silver screen for the past 30 years with pale imitators of the original ""Night of the Living Dead"". As for ""The Blair Witch Project"" itself, the film is two-dimensional in both character and plot.  I couldn't help but to keep looking at my watch everytime a series of whiny exchanges between the three main characters kept repeating ad nauseam. Unfortunately, the public at large seldom allows themselves the opportunity to view older movies for the first time.  If you would like to see far superior films to ""The Blair Witch Project"", I would suggest you rent the original ""The Haunting"" from 1963 >""Curse of the Demon"" from 1957, ""Five Million Years to Earth"" from 1968, and ""Freaks"" from 1932. It's interesting to note that ""Freaks"" was originally panned by the critics and by the public as being depraved yet it is now regarded as a horror classic which was way ahead of its time. I would encourage you to pick up any of the above mentioned videos when you rent ""The Blair Witch Project"" for Halloween.  If you even get the slightest chill from viewing ""The Blair Witch Project"" you'll break out in goosebumps while seeing any of the older and far superior videos.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A masterpiece. The whole movie is as you would've found it if they truly went missing,"A masterpiece, to put it simply, and one of the most influential and iconic horror movies of all time. It's a disturbing film without any violence or any monsters.The naturalism of the actors is unrivaled. It's impossible to overstate how compelling each performance is. Our main character is a joy to behold in every scene, with the perfect tone and expression to accompany every word of dialog. Every minute she wasn't in frame speaking into the camera was a minute I wished she were. I could not imagine a better performance.The recurring sense of ""dread"" as each night falls, and the slow escalation of the threat, followed by the sudden release of tension at dawn, puts the viewer through an ordeal that you share with the characters. The film perfectly captures the feeling of being lost in the woods. The panic, the anxiety, and how easy it is to get turned around. On one of the final nights as the sun is setting, you can hear the desperation in Heather's voice as they know what's coming and are powerless to stop it.There couldn't have been a better ending. It's the stuff you don't see that makes this film so scary. Your own imagination is always more terrifying than anything on screen.The movie had perfect timing and excellent marketing. Came out when the internet was still the Wild Wild West. It was pretty difficult to prove or disprove anything quickly and search engines were still pretty primitive. The studio took advantage of this and as a result the movie had a lot of buildup. I dont' think anyone will ever be able to recreate that type of marketing again.

sequel = overkill,"PLEASE, DON'T DO A SEQUEL!!!!Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the first Blair Witch Project even in the midst of the endless hype and the ""scariest movie ever"" crap.

I'm glad that it at least scared the pants off the bloated Hollywood producer-types with their trillion-dollar budgets, BUT...A sequel here would do nothing but prove that young directors can't ever make it big on low-budget masterpieces without running it into the ground first with a souped-up Act Two.

The Blair Bitch Project!,"Boy... I don't know if I've ever seen so many mixed feelings towards a movie. Some people were so offended that they felt the need to post multiple comments here! If you have that many issues that you have to keep coming back and re-insulting this movie, then maybe it touched a nerve and you just don't want to admit it.The Blair Witch Project is an experiment in fear. It gives the impression that three student filmmakers are going into the Maryland woods to film a documentary about a supposed witch that lived in the area many years ago. It is also insinuated that the witch influenced a serial killed in the '30s. Unfortunately for our clueless heroes, they get REALLY lost in the woods and spend a couple of days just wandering around. They have a compass, so it seems that the Witch is somehow causing them to walk in circles. As the intrepid trio travel through the woods, they find little ""gifts"" left behind by the Witch... piles of stones, little men made of sticks, and a rather nasty bundle with a soft, chewy center. A particularly scary part features an attack on the group's tent. Later, one of them vanishes in the night. The remaining two students finally end up at the house of the 30's serial killer...No spoilers. You'll have to see what happens for yourself.I'm not pretending that this is a major Hollywood release... less than $50,000 was spent on equipment and production. But this isn't meant to be high-budget. The movie looks exactly like it's supposed to... a student film that was edited together by people who found the ""lost"" footage after the students ""disappeared"". (I did think it was funny that some people thought this was real... the hype on the Sci Fi channel was great - it took quite a bit of convincing, plus video footage of the three actors alive and well on MTV, to show that they were still alive!)I think some people are angry at this film because they were expecting the next Exorcist or Poltergeist. Unless you're blind, it's blatantly obvious from the previews that the movie is shot with shaky cameras in a very ""real"" environment. If you came to this movie expecting something else, then you deserve to lose your $7.50.Also, I think people were really p***ed that they didn't get to see the Witch. In this age of CGI monstrosities and special effect-packed blockbusters, many movie-goers expect to see the monster all the time. If that's what you want, go rent The Haunting remake or Godzilla. I'd wager these same people would get upset at the original Haunting for not showing the ghosts.Maybe some of the people who hate this movie really WERE scared and it bothered them so much that they decided to pan the flick. Either way, I think it's worth giving this movie a chance... don't take it too seriously, though... it's a much better ride if you sit back and try to watch it with an open mind. Be prepared, because the ""action"" doesn't really kick in until halfway into the movie, and there isn't a whole lot of it. This is more of a suspense movie, not a slasher flick or an action horror movie.I've seen BWP twice in the theatre and once on video... and the last 5 minutes STILL gives me goosebumps.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Once and for all....is it real or not?,"I am confused. I would like to know one way or the other from someone who knows FOR SURE if the Blair Witch Project was real or not. I saw it in the theater when it came out...but I also bought it on video and watched it again last night. It had a short news-like video that came with the movie itself. In it were news clips of the three of them disappearing and a guy talking about how the film reels were found buried in the rubble of that house in the woods. I am having a really hard time figuring out whether or not it is real. I thought that it was real actual footage that they took before they came up missing...and that they are still missing...and that the movie was made by whoever found the film and picked up where the three of them left off...which would explain why there is a crew and a producer and such. Is that incorrect? Even if the whole thing was made up, it is still a scary movie that was well-made...but I just want to know the truth!

Blair Witch Project,"I have watched the Blair Witch Project numerous times and have come to the conclusion that considering the budget it was made on it is a very good film. It is not the scariest horror film of all time but it will make you shiver. The hand held cameras can start to irritate one after a while but if your a film lover then it is definitely worth watching. The film uses loud screams and dark lighting to scare the audience into the back of their seat. When the first came out the viewers believed that it was real until the truth behind it was released. All characters are interesting and are well acted. The story is about three teenagers who are filming a school project, they disappear into the woods looking the Blair witch legend. All three are killed by her and the footage is found a year later. It is not a gory film but by not seeing the violence it makes it scarier because you have to imagine it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Simplicty, brillance, effectiveness - a deadly combination","The Blair Witch Project is, in my humble opinion, a masterpiece of clever use of minimal resources, hype, selective leakage of information and superb disinformation that made a film that cost a pittance into a spectacular success.  It did this not by trying to defy its humble origins but indeed it played on them in the most effective way;  it used its amateur feel and low budget appearance to make it look all the more real and this was backed up by hyping people into believing that it was indeed real (at least for a time).Even when they realised that they had been `duped' so to speak they were intrigued (as was I) to find how this had been done to so many people so effectively.  The film came out very late in Australia (so we could cop the 2nd hand prints from the US) but I had purchased it on DVD from the US about two months before its theatrical release and had read a great deal about it and the hype surrounding it before even I saw it.It was intriguing to note the trickle of broken information that made it even here, others had heard this or that about this new film and many even believed it to be real - the thing was everyone wanted to see it very badly.Not everyone who saw it was effected by it - some didn't get it, some didn't like it, some weren't scared by it (one friend of mine borrowed the DVD and she watched it at midday with the lights all on and the windows open cuddled up with her border collie on the sofa;  she deliberately tried to minimise the scare impact, I tend to show it with all the lights off and around midnight!).Others had heard too much real information for the hype to have worked properly - but that's ok, I watched the film to see what they had tried to do and how they had tried to do it and I was enormously impressed by how someone took what they had and used simplicity and ingenuity to make something work so well.This is a film that is special in many ways, like Orson Wells' radio play of `War of the Worlds' and even Ghostwatch (1992) on the BBC, this film can lull the viewer into a sense of what they are seeing is real and even if you know it isn't in the proper environment it can still send chills down one's spine and leave the shattered illusions in their mind for days afterwards. It works on a minimalist approach not widely seen for a long time and they do it very very well;  indeed this was the first DVD I ever purchased and it is still one of my favourites.Not only is it a different type of horror film - it's a different type of film all together (from almost everything else I've seen) and in this day and age of repetition that's quite an achievement.It's a shame the sequel was just so bloody awful, it had none of the feeling or atmosphere of the original.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Innovative technique. Not quite as good as it could be done.,"I spent a surprising amount of time trying to decide how I felt about this movie. It was not the scariest film of the year, nor even the scariest film of the month in which it was released, If you're looking for pure chills or something that will make you scream along with the protagonists, you won't find it here. It is, however, quite entertaining, and disturbing in a fashion that falls in the general realm of terror.The choice of storytelling medium is the instrumental deciding factor in making this film worth the price of admission (or of rental). It is such a total departure from typical Hollywood glamour and high tech fests that it imparts a deep sense of realism that could never be achieved by any other means, no matter how sophisticated the industry becomes. But the decision to use ""amateur footage"" as the sole medium for the storyline is paradoxically both the strong point and the greatest weakness of this film. First, the story couldn't work any other way without a serious rewrite. It would be too hokey any way but the way in which it's presented. But in the form of ""real life"" footage, it works. At times, the effort to make the footage look sufficiently amateurish to seem real is strained and in some cases overdone. At others, the very unprofessionalism is what makes it so moving. For instance, Heather's taped apology to their parents. Bad camera angle, no obvious makeup, bloodshot eyes, and a shot so unglamourous that even when you've read the disclaimer of fictionality, you still think for a moment... ""are you sure this isn't real?""But the most critical decision point is whether we believe that all of this would make it onto film. There is a pivotal scene in which Josh condemns Heather for ""still making movies"" when they are lost in the woods. She replies, tearfully, ""It's all I have, okay?"" Miss that scene, and you'll never stand any chance of believing that so much of this story ""realisticly"" made it onto film. Simply put, these are aspiring film makers whose life training has made it a deeply engrained habit to film everything. That's as close as you'll get to an explanation for the completeness of the film records here. Still, it's a tough sell. There are things you still can't believe got on film, yet without these scenes, the story would lose a lot in thetranslation. That's the double edged sword: show too much, you lose that natural realism, show too little, you lose the story itself. Clearly the film's producers were treading a thin line here.It worked. Just about. But there was still room for improvement.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

*** Scariest movie I have ever seen ***,"This is by far the scariest horror movie ever and I have seen a lot. Intense thriller, found footage categorized, this is very realistic to the core. And the idea that there is no reveal of the 'scary characters' that is normally expected towards the movie ending makes it more realistic and scarier.During the course of the movie, you will love (or hate) the characters surely it doesn't matter but you'll get attached to what is happening out there. How many ever times I watched, it gives me a chill down my spine while watching few scenes in the movie, which I have rarely felt watching other movies in this genre.Ten stars to the makers and director!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Being original is not enough,"I concede it's an original, but can't overlook the irritating flaws.  By forcing the to actors to ""be real,"" they ad lib.  That encourages Heather's shrill line deliveries, and a middle that lags as the crew breaks down into days (and nights) of bickering.  As for who's doing what to whom: Face it, it's a deliberate muddle.  That's why it's scaring so many people.  They're letting their minds convince them something awful is going on when no one can be sure of anything.  Yet, ironically, this cinematic chicanery is the film's strength.

Nightmarish and truly frightening genius,"These filmmakers know what is truly frightening. People don't get it. People can not watch a movie and put themselves into a scenario and imagine how terrifying it would be to be hopelessly lost, having your friend disappear mysteriously and be awoken late in the night by his futile cries for help and knowing there is nothing you can do, and most terrifying of all being stalked by what you can't see. People don't like this movie because it forces you to reach into the deepest part of your mind and imagine what is stalking you. If you don't know what it is, you can imagine anything. That is what makes this movie so terrifying. This is brilliant and very well done. ***** out of ***** and for all you dumb mother F****** who don't like this movie.

Good movie overwhelmed by hype,"The Blair Witch Project was a good movie, but totally overwhelmed by the hype surrounding it.I first became aware of Blair a while back when one of their promo trailers ran on a cable access channel here in Brooklyn.  It left me questioning whether this was a true story or some put on.  It was very well done and really psyched me for the acutal movie.  However, all the hype became totally out of hand once the movie was released.Now, to the movie itself.  The plot line was very well developed at the beginning of the movie and was able to sustain itself for the initial foray of Heather, Mike and Josh in the woods.  However, the mid section with everyone running around in the woods became extremely tedious and even annoying at time with their ineptitude.  But, this was rectified with the truly spooky ending, the type that will always haunt you (if you got into the movie that is).  I really appreciated a horror story built around the psychological elements of fear as opposed to a lot of overrated special effects.My rating - 7.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Unorthodox yet thrilling horror.,"I watched the Blair witch first with some friends of mine, then gave it a rewatch on my own. On both occasions I loved it, and at the same time was extremely scared in many moments. The acting throughout this film, considering the lack of experience, is vey impressive.

Cult Classic Or Put-On?,"Not many movies have caused as much of a sensation as ""The Blair Witch Project.""  Shot on a shoestring budget, this movie was supposedly a documentary shot by doomed film students.

The filmmakers tried to carry on that belief, creating their own mythology and history.  But personally, I was not impressed.  I'd say this movie's not for everyone.

The Bore Witch Project,The film is not a new type of filmmaking.  Just look at The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and the camera movement.  This film does not have a story and is not entertaining at all.

Not scary -- spooky,"I'm quite surprised here since I liked this film. I'm not saying it's a masterpiece or the ""scariest film ever made"" because it's not. However, I found it quite spooky. I didn't jump or anything, but when you think about how these people must have felt out in the woods and if you have any imagination at all, it's got to be at least a little bit spooky. I found ""The Blair Witch Project"" to be quite fascinating and interesting. The madness of it all is what drives the film forward not the question whether there is a witch or not. And thank you very much, for there not being any ""scary"" witch seen in the film. I hate the skeleton in ""Hellraiser"", I hate the monsters in ""In the Mouth of Madness"" and ""The Faculty"", I hate Jason in ""Friday the 13th"" What you see is not always what makes a film scary or not, it's where your imagination leads you that makes a film scary or spooky. Now, some of you will have that kind of imagination that makes you not see the spookiness in this film (nothing wrong with that) and others will have the kind of imagination that will make them think this is the scariest fim they have ever seen (and I envy those people). I'm stuck in between, but I have to admit that I enjoyed the film and it was much better than I expected it to be since no one I know have liked it. I would probably give this film a 6 out of 10 because I think it deserved it. What I didn't understand, though, was the ending. I figured that ""now it begins -- the *scary* parts"" and then it just ended. Spooky, not scary. (I saw ""Forces of Nature"" as well today, and I have to admit it, after having seen that disgrace of a film even ""See No Evil, Hear No Evil"" [Sorry, Kevin Spacey, :-)] would have been a great film, so maybe that's why I found BWP quite entertaining.)",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Weak.,"One word sums up this movie: WEAK.If you are anticipating a scary movie, you will be vastly disappointed. Except for the last 5 seconds, the movie was totally without anything scary. The movie spent a boring hour and a half building up for this final moment. Through this, some audience members were rewarded with motion sickness due to the actors inability to hold a camera without having violent shaking fits.  These audience members did not only go home disappointed, but they had a whopping headache as well.  Those of us who were lucky enough not to be affected by the shaking actors, got to enjoy watching 3 idiots wander around the woods because nary a one could read a compass or a map.  The only remotely entertaining part of the movie was watching the actors argue over who is to blame for their situation.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the most original ideas ever used in a motion picture.Chilling.,"I remember being afraid to enter the cellar at all hours.I was afraid to enter a dark room and I was afraid to enter anyplace that represented darkness.I was afraid because I did not know what was beyond that darkness.So what a chilling experience it was for me when I viewed ""The Blair Witch Project"".In actuality,""The Evil Dead"" which was also set in the woods,did a much better job at scaring me as well as this film did.They are both great horror films that deal with the unknown. What remained so eerie about this film is that we are never allowed to remind ourselves that this is only a movie.It works because there are no special effects,big stars or a man running around with a machete wearing a hockey mask.""The Blair Witch Project"" is the kind of horror movie that I would probably watch once every Halloween.Do I think ""The Blair Witch Project"" is one of the scariest films ever made.Yes,I do.I don't think it's scary enough to freak us out.""The Exorcist"" did a better job at that.""The Blair Witch Project"" is worth being called one of the scariest films ever made because in my opinion,the unknown can be a frightening subject and that is what ""The Blair Witch Project"" is all about.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It's like an internet stock:,"It's like an internet stock:  it was hyped on the internet, soared briefly after its IPO (sorry, its premiere) and is destined to sink toward oblivion. The idea is very clever; but the realization is mostly a bunch of X-Gens whining over who got them lost in the woods and how they're going to get the equipment back to the rental store.  Over and over again one keeps thinking: they're lost, they're hungry, they're scared; why do they keep the cameras running?  The answer of course is that there wouldn't be a film without it. I'd rank this a lot lower except that it does have the one great virtue of a mediocre ultra-low budget film--audacity.  Some thirty-five years ago, some teenage friends of mine set out to make an 8mm version of the Ten Commandments; the only scene they got on film was the un-parting of the Red Sea.  It was awful.  It had guts.  I give points for guts.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A waste of time (and money),"I've been thinking a week about this picture now, and yes: it IS  the worst movie I've ever seen. Knowing it was a cheap movie, but reading it was a scary one, I thought ""please, surprise me"". But no, this was very VERY boring. At a certain moment the first more or less scary moments occur, the lights turn on and the movie is over! Hitchcock knew how to bring suspense in a picture (like ""the Birds"" or ""Psycho""), a number of movies knew how to bring scary filth (like ""Evil dead"" or ""Hellraiser""), both being able to scare you in some way. This movie doesn't either of them. Together with the illogical behaviour of the 3 main characters to find a way out of the woods, I had to close my eyes many times: It was a slow, boring, illogical and bad movie. The only really scary moment was the close-up where tears (or...) came out of the  girls nose: close your eyes please... Do not see this movie: a waste of your time and money.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

And the hand-held camera work (often held in the trembling hand of someone running pell-mell through the woods...I mean, would you really keep filming??? but I won't quibble) is definitely quease-inducing for anyone with a tendency to motion sickness. In my case, the hype definitely hurt--the movie was creepy, but really scary? Nah. It also became repetitive--during the day, our heroes shrieked at each other for getting lost; after dark, they heard scary things; and when it got light they shrieked some more.

The location of the movie was basic, just a dark, creepy forest. It was a kinda scary movie, however, there weren't any jumpscares. In my opinion, it's more of like a psychological-horror movie. The acting was really good and so believable. I have to admit, that it was really tiring and exhausting of watching a movie, through a video camera and the quality wasn't the best.

A brilliant horror movie,"This is one of my favorite horror films of all time. The main reason I love it is because it leaves everything up to the imagination of the viewer. It doesn't show you the villain (whoever or whatever it may be), so you have to decide for yourself what is happening. This film gives the viewer just as large of a role in the film as it does with the characters. I can't think of many films that do that, so this film is truly one of a kind. If you don't have an imagination and like to have every detail of a film spoonfed to you, this film is not the one for you. This is a horror film that actually requires the viewer to think, and not all viewers like to do that, so that's one of the main reasons many seem to dislike it.This film doesn't need cheap gore, brutal death scenes, tasteless nudity, or even overly loud jump scares. It relies solely on suspense and atmosphere. Every moment of the film captures the viewer's interest and keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for what is going to happen next. The amount of tension this film builds is horrifying. There is a brooding atmosphere that permeates the entire film. The second you see the characters, you can sense that something bad is going to happen and you dread it. You really feel sorry for the characters and sympathize with the situation they're going through. This is due to the amazing performances from Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, and Joshua Leonard. You can't tell they're acting at all. It seems as if they're truly in danger.If you like subtle, intelligent horror films that are truly about being scary rather than blood, gore, and loud noises, this is the film for you. If not, then perhaps you would be better off watching something else.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

the woods will never be the same again,"A lot of people tell me that they did not find the blair witch project scary in anyway shape or form. I later found out that most of these people had seen it in the cinema so what do they expect. You can not be truly scared when you are surrounded by loads of other people, eating and coughing and walking in and out all the time. So i waited for it to come to video. And when it arrived, i rented it, went home, waited till midnight, closed one set of curtains, left another set open, turned off all the lights and plugged in my big headphones. Now that is the best way to view this film, because after it had finished, i found myself running up the stairs, straight into the bathroom just so i could lock the door behind me. The Blair Witch Project chilled me to the bone. When i was younger, i played a lot in my local woods, and sometimes i would be afraid of what lurked in them, so this film attacked that fear with a vengeance. The performances (improvisations) were very real, aswell as the atmosphere. The attitudes the three characters had were believable, very human unlike most other horror films. And with my headphones on, each footstep, shout and the quiet cracking of twigs could be heard, which made it more chilling, as it's the almost unhearable sounds which create the scares.

Can't believe this only has a 6 right now!,"TBWP is on TV right now as I type this, hence my curiosity to visit the IMDb to see what rating this film had. WOW.. shock, surprise.. it's only got a 6 star rating?! The votes obviously are largely skewed by the stupid sheep who believed the film was 'real' and bought into the marketing hype, then felt ripped off, and angry at the marketing hype around it once they realized that this was a mock-umentary.Take it for what it is.At the time (1999), it was somewhat unique in being entirely shot with a hand-held camera. While some people may the camera shaking, going out of focus and such annoying, it all adds to the 'realness' of the concept that you as a viewer are meant to be buying into. It's not fair to take away ratings points based on 'poor production quality', 'not many special effects', 'no big-name actors', or the way in which the film was marketed.Instead, the story is intriguing, and while it has its moments of 'less interesting' dialog, generally for much of the 84-minute running time, you are kept on the edge of your seat, or perhaps for some, hiding behind it! The premise of the film is simple, and so not much really happens (""it's about these kids who get lost in a scary forest"" - true), but that's exactly why TBWP works. The film didn't need to be complicated, and it isn't - all it needed was a few 'setbacks' or 'issues' for the kids come across, and the film delivers.On the downside, I do recall feeling at the time of my first viewing that the film was possibly too short, if anything. There are instances where you might say to yourself (or to others watching with you) ""they can't be that stupid, can they?"" -- but hey, the world is full of stupid people - and hey, not everyone goes to scouts and learns what you can do to help you get your bearings if you get lost in the woods..I gave the film a 7 out of 10, though I wish IMDb allowed 1/2-pts as I feel a 7.5 is where this film is at.

...now *that* was truly terrifying (not?),"Not the traditional horror flick at all. Certainly not scary in the usual sense...

So the expected chills were there, but they were mainly lurking in the back of my mind while I found myself thinking aloud over their actions (at one point I was laughing with ridicule at the whole situation; now *that* was truly terrifying). Ending smells slightly of a cop-out, but would make good fan-theory fodder.

Possibly The Scariest Movie I've Ever Seen,"When I heard about this movie, I had no idea what was so special about it. To me, it seemed like a cheesy low budget movie that had no scary elements to it. Just a bunch of teenagers running around with video cameras in the woods. The spoofs of this movie didn't help either. Last Halloween, I decided to rent this movie and watch it alone one night. I don't think I ever had such trouble sleeping as I did that night. This movie is defiantly one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. It's a rarity when a movie scares me at all, let alone follow me far after the screen is turned off. It's a shame to me that this movie is so underrated. It is unfortunate that people hate this movie because of its lack of special effects, music, and other elements of the modern horror movie (most of which i despise). Perhaps the reason most people did not enjoy this movie is because they actually need to use some brain power to grasp the true horror of this picture. Unlike most horror movies these days where producers use flashy gimmicks to distract viewers from a lack of plot or writing, the Blair Witch Project uses only reality and believable situations, leaving a raw, shocking experience for those intelligent enough to enjoy it. To me, the reason this movie is so successful is because of how real it feels, and that your imagination is left to do so much. The plot could easily of been based on a true story, and many people actually thought this movie was real at its release. Despite not being real or based on anything, it isn't preposterous to think something like this can happen. As you may of noticed, I haven't mentioned anything specific about the movie. This is because once you know the basic idea, thats all you need. Anything more is spoiler, and will ruin the experience. Just trust me, if you are sick of most horror movies, give this a shot. Watch it alone, at night, with the lights out. It's an experience you will never forget.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Interesting, but not spectacular","I thought the concept for this film was highly original and fairly well-executed. Not being a fan of horror/thriller, I was quite worried that I'd be terrified, as EVERYONE I spoke with said the movie was very, very scary (my sister would not go camping after she saw it). Well, perhaps I'm jaded because I'm in my thirties, but there was only one point in the film where I was moderately startled. I was never terrified, or even remotely disturbed. While I understand the device of having the discovered footage that the three film makers shot on their quest for the witch, it was this very device that kept me too distanced to be scared. If you're really terrified by all the weird goings on and so on, I'm sorry, no matter how dedicated a film maker you are, you don't switch on your video camera. Obviously the film could not have been made without making this assumption, but I was never convinced that there was anything that scary, because the characters always had the presence of mind to turn their cameras on. Still, it's worth seeing if you're interested in how video looks blown up to 35 mm. Just one additional note: if you are prone to motion sickness, you'd be well-advised to take some gravol or wear sea bands.

Great horror.,"I watched The Blair Witch Project again (and the commentary and extras). Was it still a good movie, was it still scary? Absolutely. The characters were strong and realistic and showed real emotions, the setting was perfect and fully used, and the use of sound was awesome. All that made for an incredible atmosphere. At only 77 minutes, the movie moved along at a brisk pace. The shaky footage wasn't that bad at all and some of the shots of the woods are just great. I will admit that some of the power of the film has somewhat diminished over the years (and from watching it at least four times!) but the same can be said of most any scary horror flick. The ending still gave me chills for a good fifteen seconds though. I even rewound it to check something and it creeped me out a second time! BWP is not conventional horror and that's one of the reasons it works so well (but maybe that's the problem for some people too?)it's different, unique. The presentation, backed up with the mythos, is what really makes this movie something special. I've never seen another quite like it. The DVD commentary is decent and goes over the making of the film. The makers discussed the great ideas and techniques used to make the film as realistic as possible. The three trailers were pretty cool toono wonder it was a box-office hit. I also watched Curse of the Blair Witch and Stick and Stones.

"No slashers, no demons, just horror!","The Blair Witch Project is a throwback of sorts.  If you are looking for a slasher flick like Nightmare and Elm Street, or Hellraiser, prepared to be disappointed.  On the other hand, if you are looking for a psychological thriller along the lines of Psycho you will be pleasantly surprised.The Blair Witch is a breath of fresh air to a currently stale and predictable movie industry.  It is nice to see a film without a forced sexual relationship, and awful tag-lines do well in Hollywood.This movie seems incredibly scary to me, because it is so realistic.  Not only because of the plot, but because of the style in which it was pieced together.  I could see myself in the same scenario as these three students lost in the woods.  Would I lose my cool?  Yes.  Would I start fearing for my life?  Yes.  And that is what makes this movie so interesting. I can see where many people have been and will continue to be ""fooled"" by the realism of this flick.  To this day I have co-workers, and friends trying to convince me that what happened was real.  I guess they are going to be surprised when they see one of the three student film-makers staring in the latest, summer blockbuster in the year 2000.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Not a bad idea for a film school project, but","it should never have been released as a major motion picture.It was a small, albeit creative, idea that through hype and manipulation was unleashed on an unsuspecting public. This film isn't masterful for its horror or suspense, but for its manipulation of the public at large. It's important for its ""scam"" effect.The most that can be said of this movie is that it is a boring, obscenity laden, story of 3 nitwits lost in the woods. That's it! And it was never truly scary, although it did have a creepy moment or two in it.The characters were completely unlikable and unsympathetic, and I kept hoping the witch would get them sooner, rather then later.For masterful suspense, try Hitchcock.

Not that scary really.,"With all the hype surrounding this film you would expect God himself to make an appearance.  Unfortunately there is a ""is that all"" feeling at the end. It's not a bad film, just not as good as I was expecting.  That wonderfully modern cliché about being impossible to live up to the hype obviously applies here.The thing is, with all the back-story of how it was made this is a very interesting story.  If possible you should really check out the Director's commentary on the DVD edition, it really is worth the effort.  The problem is that to review the film you have to forget about this.  What you're left with is an above average film, which promises a lot for its crew's futures.The three actors are all functional; Heather Donahue really excels though and deserves to go further than this.  She is probably the best reason to watch this film other than the making-of story.  Anyhow, give it a blast, it seems people either love it or hate it, somehow I've fallen somewhere in the middle.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Unsettling mojo,"I've an older brother who, when we were younger and shared a room, would NEVER profess to being scared at horror movies.  When he'd shout in his sleep hours later, I knew better.  I wonder how many like him were in the theatre with me last Friday night.  I'm not proud -- the ending to this one had -- has -- me spooked.I won't attempt to analyze why.  Too much of that spoils the fun.  It's not a perfect film.  But suffice it to say that those involved in its creation have tapped into a set of sounds and images that trigger subconscious dread and terror in a large number of people (noises in the dark, being isolated and disoriented, a feeling of abandonment, etc.).  And that's why it works, and still lingers in my head.Now why can't people just play that angle?  I can understand the approach taken by Artisan in its marketing campaign, but when unaffiliated critics start bandying about phrases like ""scariest movie of the millennium,"" they're just drawing a line in the sand, and thinking too much in the short term.  Instead of people debating the interpretations of the mythology, the discussion centers mainly on how one answers the ""Was it scary for you?"" question.  And that's not enough of an intellectual challenge to keep a movie alive for too long.I've wanted to see this movie since reading reports of it at Sundance.  I knew from past disappointments to simply avoid reading the thousands of subsequent news stories on its imminent arrival to my cinema.  I'm glad I did.  It won't be the last time.Turn off the news.

A Genuine Horror Film,"The Blair Witch Project was a box office hit at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival and was hailed by critics and audiences alike. Eventhough it only grossed $12 million in production, it was one of the biggest box office hits of 1999.Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Micheal Williams are film students at Montgomary College in Maryland. They are given a project by their film professor to do a documentary about a legendary witch scandal that occured during the Colonial days. They travel to the small town of Burkitsville to interview the locals about what they know on the Blair Witch. After one day of filming, they decide to head up to Burkitsville's Black Forest where they choose to film at Coffin Rock and other locations. When they reach the forest, it starts out like a walk in the park when they stick to their path. But, as the story moves along, they go off their path which ends up getting them lost. As the nights go by, they hear noises that don't sound normal for camping, and when the sun rises, they discover new things outside their tent every morning when they wake up. Their trip turns into nothing but a pure nightmare in the Black Forest of Maryland. Their cameras never stop rolling.Produced and directed by Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick (Blair Witch 2), The Blair Witch Project is a very chilling and disturbing movie that will leave you breathless by the end. For sure though, it is a very good movie.Best Ages:    15 & Up!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The fear of the unseen can be potent in a movie, as evidenced by the creepy forest scene in ""Night of the Demon"" (1958).  But ""Blair Witch"" is strictly an amateur affair from start to finish.  The characters were poorly developed and not the least appealing.  I didn't care what happened to them. As for the hand-held camera, it was effective for maybe ten minutes, then its effect became irritating...very irritating.

A legend is born,"The blair witch project has always been infamous in the horror genre as a corner stone. It also tackles one of my favourites in the genre which is found footage.

Heather, Michael and Joshua for the most part are reponsible for the success from the interviews in the beginning it helps build this image of a person in the forrest. When the three students go in there it builds into something pretty shocking. It shows you don't need blood or jumpscares and if films like this can make great at the box office it really shows somthing that hollywood is missing these days and thats real filmaking like this and if it wasn't for the blaire witch project many modern film might have never had any influence to go off of.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Utterly unfrightening amateur crap...,"This movie should be retitled in the name of Psychology. I suggest a name change from 'The Blair Witch Project' to 'The Effects of What a pseudo-Documentary of Three Bickering, Swearing, Sleep, Food and Cigarette Deprived American 20-Somethings With Over-Active Imaginations Due to Emotional Instability [or the lack of the afore mentioned] Can Have [or have not!] on a typical American audience.' Doubtlessly that title would be a burden for cinema-listings, but seriously! This movie seemed over-long, yet it couldn't have been more than a little over an hour long. I couldn't help yawning. Maybe I'm not impressionable enough, maybe I've seen too many cheap-thrill type shockers to get the subtlies... maybe the home-films shot by my parents of my siblings and I frolicking in our garden are more inspired. Lets face it, this 'film' just defies any logical explanation of a plot, a purpose or a reason. Furthermore, it has been way overhyped. The short trailer featuring a snippet of the Heather character's desperate soliloquy to the camera was actually scarier out of context on the t.v. screen. But that's the price you pay for creating false impressions--some are driven home in individuals willing and possessing the trait of being conned by hype; others just end up having their illusions shattered. Just between you and me, I knew deep down I wouldn't be scared, cause that's just not my personality, but I needed to verify it. Perhaps that's the other attraction of such movies... they make us doubt our senses and our convictions. But only temporarily. The moral of this story is that the real scares we have to experience ourselves. I don't believe such badly filmed footage can recreate in the audience any feelings of the terror felt by the actors.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"I know it's a fake, but still scary.","Before I saw ""the Blair witch project"", all of the mass media said that it was a fiction, more real than a non-fiction. I took it as a commercial thing, only to raise concern. They also recommended to go ad check the ""Blairwitch.com"", an official web site of the movie.( Later,I was aware of the fact that without the basic information of the movie, it isn't scary at all.) I took their recommend and saw the movie finally. At first, the trembling of the scenes and unfamiliar actors seemed to me that it was pretending to be a sort of documentaries. But as running of the movie, I found myself trembling with fear just like the actors doing at the scenes. Even the subject of the fear,like Freddy Kruger, appears enough. It just gives you the feelings that you are chased with something, and you can sleep peacefully no more. It's the beauty of the film. It's not that kind of bloody horror movie. Without lots of blood, screaming, and chopped body, the Blair witch project team made it a really scary movie.

Oh dear!,"When getting ready to go and see the Blair Witch Project I had seen a fair amount of television programmes showing scenes of the film with pictures of film-goers coming out of the cinema scared witless. The thing is that they must have been witless in the first place because all this film is, is a cheap camcorder documentary. The actors strive to be real which somehow they never achieve. Only the last 15 minutes of the film were remotely scary while the 65 mins at the start were weak. To believe the legend you would have to be Mr. Gullible which doesn't help. I thought that in the last 15 minutes the film could redeam itself with... (do not read on if you haven't seen the film).....some mutilations and the girl (who screamed so much I wanted to kill her)running around being chased. Unfortunately this film would have been good if it was as good as the hype, but it never could match that, maybe that was the problem. I read somewhere that the film cost $33,000 dollars to make so I shouldn't be too harsh but as it approches or maybe goes over $100 million in the box office I can but wonder ""is this a huge scam?""

"Claustrophobic, Atmospheric, Creepy, Well-Acted Are All Words To Describe This Terrifying Chiller!","The first time I saw ""The Blair Witch Project"" was when I was 13. I had fallen asleep within the first 45 minutes. I had been extremely disappointed. Now, I had heard about how ""Paranormal Activity"" is one of the creepiest horror movies of the year. I thought that if I'm going to see ""Paranormal Activity,"" then I'd better watch this movie again in order to know what I'm in for. After a second viewing, I admit that ""The Blair Witch Project"" is absolutely one of the creepiest horror movies I've ever seen.Shot like footage, ""BWP"" follows three student filmmakers shooting a documentary: Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Mike Williams. Heather is the head director of a documentary about the infamous Blair Witch of Blair, Maryland. After many strange and eerie stories of the witch, including the tales of over seven children being kidnapped and found dead, the three teens are pretty skeptical that there really is any witch living in the woods of Burkitsville. As they venture into the woods to shoot their film, strange things happen, things that they never thought would happen. Things that are going to tear them apart emotionally. Heather, Josh, and Mike discover that the Blair Witch might be more than just a legend.""The Blair Witch Project"" opens as a seemingly ordinary documentary-style horror movie. But there is plenty to love about it. As the movie progresses, it unfolds with a horrifying tension, with an event just as frightening as the one before it. Also, the Burkitsville woods are a perfect atmosphere for the movie. The camera kept closing in on the cast, and it produced a strong feeling of claustrophobia. Whenever I heard a noise in the background, and one of the filmmakers would scream ""What the **** was that?!"", I kept turning my head back and forth to see if there was anything there. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a very good example of ""What you don't see is scarier than what you do see.""The movie gives excellent performances by Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Mike Williams. The most iconic moment of the movie, with Heather turning on the camera and making a tearjerking apology to her family and the others, is one of the most heartbreaking moments of the movie.""The Blair Witch Project"" was a movie with a very low budget of 11,000 dollars. And after a lot of hype, audiences ran to the theaters and were scared out of their wits, bringing in over 5, million dollars in a weekend. The movie had beaten out the box-office record that was held by the horror classic ""Halloween."" This movie takes a rather simple premise and goes a long way with it.

"The true fear, is within ourselves","""The Blair Witch Project"" is not about drenching the audience with blood and gore, of terrorizing them through the film.  Well, okay, maybe the second one, but it's much more than a horror movie.  It is a crude but tolerable display of an emotion that each one of us holds dear in our hearts...fear.  Everyone fears something, no matter how big or small or important or insignificant it may be. This movie toys on that emotion to the fullest extent.  You do not watch ""The Blair Witch Project"", you feel it. We live in a world that is fully dominated by technology, and money.  With ""The Blair Witch Project"", that is not the case.  It was made on a shoestring budget, and used some of the simplest filmaking techniques around.  Yet, it shows us that no matter what we may see when it comes to horror, the greatest creator of fear is our own imaginations.

HYPE, hype the movie on the net. Start with some false rumors about how great this movie really is over the Internet and take it from there.Obviously this worked far over all expectations. The movie became a super hit, almost as big as a Blockbuster and with only a 60 000 dollar budget. This movie really is something special, I have never seen a worse movie.

It is noting scary about Blair Witch except the HYPE. I can only draw comparison to Germany 1939. Everyone there fell for the HYPE.This really shows only one thing. It could happen again.Blair Witch is shot with a first person view through out the whole movie. It is shaky camera work, lousy acting, bad script and a boring result. The only persons that can be afraid of this movie must be 12 years old and never been out in the forest or in the cinema. The last 30 seconds of the movie have some excitement but that is all... and last time I checked that was not enough... but hey... maybe that changed too.All the people that comes out from the cinema saying that they enjoyed the movie must have watched it with their eyes wide shut.

The preview was very scary, making me not want to see it.  But, I became so curious after reading about how the film was made and how the actors were chosen, that I realized I had to see it.  So, there we were sitting in the theater waiting to be scared and it never happened. I guess I'm just jaded or something.  Now, I admire the film as innovative and different.  I am a huge fan of independent film.  And there were a couple of things that were creepy, but I really felt it didn't deliver.  I told this to a young friend of mine, and then he went to see it and was scared out of his wits!  I have heard some people say that the reason they were so scared, was because it was true and the footage was the actual footage!  How funny is that?  People really think this is real!  Hey folks, it's a movie --  written by writers and those are actors.  I guess if it were real, it would truly be scary, but then we wouldn't be seeing it in a movie theater.

Slower than you'd expect for the buzz it gets,"The trailblazer of found footage , viral marketing, and shoe-string budget horror, Blair Witch deserves a place in the ""Horror House of Fame.""

The Web site is more entertaining than the movie,"After weeks of reading the hype about this independent film that supposedly impressed audiences at the Sundance Film Festival, I finally found time to see it in Colma, California a town in which the dead ""residents"" outnumber the living. After seeing this movie, I envied those dead people buried in the nearby cemeteries. They did not have to sit through 87 minutes of shaky handheld footage.Rather than a ghost story, the Blair Witch Project is largely a pseudo-documentary about three often-obnoxious Gen-Xers lost in the woods. We grasp their plight early in the film, so it's difficult to endure their bickering and histrionics after that point is made. By the time we arrive at the film's climax, most of us are glad to know that these tiresome filmmakers will be bound, tortured and disemboweled.The Blair Witch Project Web site actually contains more information than we see presented in the film. Web surfers are allowed to read the ""back-story"" of the Blair witch and her lingering hold on the Burkitsville community. I was hoping to see some standard ""talking head"" footage of the law enforcement officers and the private investigator who eventually located the personal effects of the missing filmmakers. I also expected interviews with the trio's grieving friends and relatives. While I normally dislike such cinematic cliches, in this instance, it would have been a relief.This film could easily be edited down to about twenty minutes of footage that could be presented as film clips within another documentary film about the filmmakers' disappearance (the film I expected to see).",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
great scare,"The Blair Witch Project manages to do something that few movies have ever done for me, scare me. In a world where studio's think that hyper stylized, CGI filled mosters are the only way for audiences to be scared, the blair witch project finds terror in the haunted woods of our own imagination. The movie builds subtly (a pile of rocks outside the tent, loud nosies in the dark, mysterious stick figures) but through this seemingly vague approach, the audience is allowed to conjure up monsters far more terrifying than anything Hollywood could manufacture. the movies also does a terrific job of creating an aura of despair. most effectively though, the movie plays on our own primal fears and that is what truly makes it one of the best horror movies i have seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Blair Witch Project: 6/10,"When my brother was coming home from visiting relatives on an airplane, he overheard a college student who saw this movie. She said that afterwards, they were so scared nobody wanted to go out for gas. Well, the movie wasn't that scary.Something that I liked is that they didn't need Conrad Baker or anyone to do the camera work, the three principal actors (Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, Michael Williams) did almost all of it themselves. Heather, Josh, and Michael (the actors's names are the same in the movie) team up for a documentary about a ""blair witch"", who supposadely haunts the woods in Burkettsville, Maryland. After intervewing townspeople, they get off to the woods.It seems that what TBWP is more about is the three amateur directors and their relationships towards each other. They have ""cabin fever"", so to speak, from being around each other for so long. But, they do find mysterious things outside of their tent after each morning- piles of rocks, for instance. They hear things that go bump in the night and try chase whatever's making the noise.Soon, the map is lost, in an obvious turn of events. They walk for 15 hours to end up in the same location. There was fear all throughout the movie; mild amount during the day (especially when they see the famous symbols), and moderate during the night. I was truly creeped at the end. I did see this before, on FX, and I was scared at the end. Although the ending is obvious, I do like that style of ending.If you're looking for a horor film where bloody ghosts pop out and cut your head off, take another one. Nothing is seen here; a couple times, the screen is completly blank except for a couple camera lines at the bottom. The editing was very poor, but I guess they're excuse for that is because it's a ""home movie"". The actors were OK, but I understand why they haven't done anything else. So, if you want to be creeped out for most of the time, rent The Blair Witch Project.My rating: 6/10Rated R for language.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Overhyped piece of garbage,"This film has got to be one of the worst movies I've seen all year.  It is not the worst, though.  I hold that honor to the god-awful ""Baby Geniuses"".Anyway, the film was not the least bit scary (unless you are scared by piles of little rocks and the sounds of sticks being hit together).  I can't believe I sat through the whole movie.  I just kept thinking, 'o.k. it's gotta get better because of all the great reviews, especially the one that read 'Scary as Hell!.'   Alas, it wasn't.  What a waste.There are much better films that scare you that you never get to see the 'evil entity', so I don't buy the argument that says I have no imagination since I never saw the witch.  ""Evil Dead"" is still the best 'Horror in the Woods' movie and that film never showed the entity either.   And it was a million times scarier than this piece of overhyped trash.But the filmmakers made millions, so I guess their happy and my opinion doesn't mean squat, since they already got my 8 bucks.  I'm just gonna be more careful before I give any pseudo filmmakers my money again.

A superb film that blends the human spirit with good old-fashioned horror,"The Blair Witch Project creates a unique blend of the terrifying with the unknown.  The audience is enticed to become part of the film-maker's world, to laugh along with the characters, to wonder what led to this, and almost to run in pure horror of the thing hunting them down.It is obvious as the film progresses that the 3 are losing their heads, their very personalities working against them, their egos and self-pride dissolving as hopelessness sets in, their mind becoming that of an alone and fearful animal.  They forget about their tedious social lives, instead the only thing that matters is finding their way out of a world they no longer have control of.The Blair Witch project is not about the Blair Witch.  It is about what can happen when humans are no longer the dominating force, and consequently what happens to the person's mind that is subjected to this horror.  All of this build-up leads to an ending that not only is absolutely terrifying, but also leaves a huge mystery, a void that only the viewer can fill.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Horror doesn't get much better than this.,"What can I say?  I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out in '99 and I was blown away.  Watching it again the other night, I realized how much of an innovative movie this is.  I've heard many people complain about it being ""not scary"" and a lack of any real ""cinematic art.""  When it comes to a horror movie, cinematic art comes last.  If I want to be scared, I want to be scared.  I don't wanna' watch some paper thin teen horror story where every scare is cheap.  Making someone jump is not scary.  Anything can do that.  Someone drops a book on a table in a quiet library, and there'd be a good chance that you might jump.  Is that book scary?  No.  Is the library scary?  No.  Is the librarian scary?  Maybe, but that's not the point.  My point is that it's hard to make a genuinely frightening film, and this is one of the few.

The Blair Witch Project is a movie that scares without showing...it's up to you to create the horrors, the unknown, the monster that you're scared of, and take the movie in as real. Suspend your disbelief, and you won't be let down. Knowing it isn't actually based on true events, for me, didn't make it any less scary.

Second comment:,"Wanted to add a little something as I was reading down on the comments.  1. Thumbs up to the guy who said it was a comedy.  Hey I agree with you. Though I thought the ending was a tad scary.  That 5 minutes is probably scarier than anything in The Haunting.  But I loved The Haunting far more because of that damn house.  But the biggest problem with THAT movie is it's labeled as a Horror movie.  Not as an adventure movie.  I'd say it almost seems the same creative team behind The Mummy, also did The Haunting. (not a known fact). and 2.  To the person who'll never be alone in the woods again. Hey you'll be missing alot.  I remember once when I was young (88-89 somewhere ) That there was this place (private land, but we had permission) not far from a church out in the country near Lewiston, MN, that was named Ruprects (spelling?) Valley.  We went into a cave , it being small, us guys went over a good pool, spiders and all, and we went way in there on our hands and knees.  Since the girls couldn't make it across that pool, they had to call us back. (I was 1 of only 3 people who bothered to make it all the way in) But anyway... I and 2 girls bothered to get lost in the woods. We though managed to find our way out of that.  Sure I we wound up go a hill at an 80% incline, but what the hell.  This is the reason I have to laugh at this most unrealistic movie.  It was shot very well (or should I say they were radical in doing so), but watching three people swear in the woods, isn't what I call scary as hell.....",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

try to ignore the hype and just keep an open mind.,"First, I feel like I have to address the buzz surrounding the movie. I am at the same time disgusted and sort of impressed with the hype. It is pretty clever when you think about it. No trailers (well, they are showing one now, but still, it took them long enough) no cast members doing the rounds on talk shows, no big budget, etc. Just the website, the documentary on the SciFi channel, and bigtime word of mouth. It sure worked. I feel for those actors, since they got paid about what I make in 2 weeks for 3 weeks of hell.  I hope to God the filmmakers were generous and gave them points in the film. I am also hearing that at most theaters, they pay the manager, etc to get up before the showing and get the crowd all hyped up, which is kind of lame. When we saw it Saturday, the owner (before she threatened people who had laser pointers) got up and yelled, ""Hey, welcome to Crossroads theater, and ARE YA READY FOR THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT?? Whooooo-hoooo! Everyone READY TO BE SCARED?"" I was like, oh please. I also heard these girls in front of me asking someone next to them if **this was a real documentary**. We got up and moved because I did not want to spend the movie sitting behind someone so incredibly stupid and naive. But I guess that's what a good job they did marketing it, because I heard there are plenty of stupid people out there who think the thing is real.  I also grudgingly admire whoever decided to market it initially as a 'hard ticket', meaning they wanted to have it only at one theater or so per city for a few weeks. I'm sure that helped the buzz.  Hyping it as the scariest movie of all time (though maybe this is more word of mouth than the filmmakers doing it) is kind of dumb, though, because people are just going to be disapointed, unless all they've seen are ""Scream"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"". I heard kids talking after the movie who were let down because they was very little gore, no monster, and no real pay-off. I had a good time because I told myself not to expect anything. I guess if you go, just keep an open mind, and don't think, ""This better be the scariest movie of all time after all the hype, or I'll be p**sed"". I do think it's kind of funny how the big studios spend millions of dollars marketing their lame summer 'event' pics, but this is the one most people are talking about wanting to see.So, that's my 2 cents as far as the hype goes.  Went and saw BWP for myself this weekend.  Inside the theater manager had to come make an announcement about laser pointers, she said if anyone used them during the movie she'd take them away and kick them out. She was this huge, burly, tough woman who looked like a prison warden so people calmed down after that and shut up.  Anyway, I loved it. Not the scariest movie I've ever seen, but if you asked me what the scariest movie I've ever seen was, I wouldn't be able to name it. I would saw BWP, the Exorcist, Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer, Last House on the Left (and a couple more I can't think of right now) are like the top scariest.  I was really impressed though. Very realistic, the way it was shot and put together, and the character's reactions to stuff. My spouse said it really scared him, which he hardly ever says, because he's been camping and that's like your worst nightmare. The whole movie was very creepy and spooky but the last 5 minutes REALLY scared the crap out of me.It's funny, the audience started out very rowdy, and I thought I'd have to ""shhh"" people the whole movie. But after the first 5 minutes, people were engrossed. As the film got more and more tense and scary, there were no screams. Instead, the whole audience just sat there cowering quietly in fear. Not a lot of talking back to the screen, etc like there is in most horror movies, and the audience was full of teenagers. That speaks for itself, I think.I read a review in which they said that the movie was all about panic, and I agree. One of the most upsetting things is the way the charcters go from calm, controlled, and joking, to nervously joking and then arguing, to trying desperately to hold it together, to understandable total freaked out panic by the last reel. As the film draws to a close they just give up all pretenses of composure and control and just panic and run around like maniacs screaming incoherently at the top of their lungs. Usually when characters in a movie do that you feel like slapping them, but the film draws you in so much that you do not blame them, one bit. You know you would probably act the same way if you were in their shoes, and the way the movie is filmed, you are pretty much in their shoes.Bottom line regarding how scary it is: If I'd been watching it by myself at home at night I probably would have started crying.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Don't Read the Reviews,To much hype.  Maybe if I wasn't aware that this was a fictional production or maybe if I ever really got lost in the woods I would have reacted differently.

"Pure terror, for only 50.000 dollars in production costs.","First of all, to all the people saying nothing much happened in ""Blair Witch project"", this is NOT ""Friday the 13th part 10"". So if you wanted to see this movie thinking a hockeymask-wearing maniac jumps from the bushes, lopping heads off with an axe, you've been heavily misinformed. You can't be cheated, nothing of the sort was ever stated in the ads. This is a movie about REAL terror, not about 7 foot mutes who get up after stabbing them 20 times with a pitch fork. Those who say they've never been remotely scared or at least feeling uneasy when hearing strange sounds in the woods at night, read no further. You don't really exist. I dare you to really watch this movie, try to experience it, and then go out in the woods at night and say you're totally cool when you hear children crying out in the dark, or twigs snapping all around you as if you're surrounded by a group of unknown animals or even humans.I must honestly say i knew about the hype when i saw this movie, and still wasn't disappointed, because once again, i KNEW there was going to be no Jason hiding in any barn waiting for an unsuspecting victim to foolishly come strolling in just to get spliced into ribbons of human flesh. I expected frustration, anger, fear, hysteria and downright TERROR. You know, the emotions real people have when in a situation like this. That's why the acting was perfect. These were real flesh and blood people who first got uneasy, then frustrated to getting more scared with each abnormal sound or found object. Real people yell at each other when frustrated and get hysterical when at the end of their emotional ropes. The photography and editing was perfect too. To people saying it was amateuristic: HELLO,WAKE UP! The whole idea of the movie is based on the premise of amateur filmmakers making the footage we, as an audience, see when they go into the woods. If these amateur filmmakers made professionally shot footage, then it would have been an amateuristic movie. The whole thing is brilliant. Right upto and including the nerve-wrecking ending. If you only have about 50.000 dollars to spend and want to make to make the best movie you can make with that kind of movie, this is how you make it.Remember: Godzilla cost over 100 million dollars.

I can't believe how BAD this film really was !!!!,"Well, never before have I gone to the cinema and disliked a film as much as this one (""Batman and Robin"" came very close).What I liked; a/ Heather Donahue - she was very convincing and I would imagine pretty good in a NORMAL film !b/ The filming - for about 5 mins, the camera stuff might have worked but it went on way TOO long.What I disliked; a/ EVERYTHING ALMOST !!!!b/ No soundtrack - this is always bad for a film, they may have wanted it to be realistic but it had no depth to it.c/ The horror factor - Horror, Scary ??? - what are people on about when they say this is a scary film. It's truly depressing and disturbing, but why would anybody want to go to the cinema for those emotions, for a good fright, yes. But depression and disturbance is something we want NOTHING of in our lives.d/ The language and dialogue - This is REALLY were the film screwed up, I have no problem with the ""F"" word when used infrequent and for the right reasons, but the use in this film was appaling. At no point was the rest of the dialogue clever.e/ The filming - Good for about all of 5 minutes and then it just got clearly boring and messy.f/ The plot - Um... didn't have much of one really. The ideal of going into the woods for a project was ""different"" but the rest a What was the nonsense about a witch anyway, more likely it was just Josh fooling around with the kids, maybe they didn't even get killed.

City Slickers,"For the first time in my life, I felt like a New Englander. While watching the students stroll around the woods, I couldn't really feel for them. First of all, they have all of these lights but they won't walk at night. I have been lost in the woods, and when you want to get home, you fight sleep and work to find your way. Also, whenever I am walking and am arguing with someone, I tend to walk faster; I don't stop, sit and pout like these babies did. Their constant stopping and camping seemed like the horror film cliche of the girl running upstairs rather than out the door.This isn't to say that I didn't like the movie, it was OK (thanks to a great ending). And despite my complaints, Blair Witch deserved the hype and box office gross because it was something new. Unfortunately, knowing Hollywood, rather than seeing this as a desire for fresh, original ideas, they will decide that what we want to see is Blair Witch sequels.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It freaked me.,"After hearing the hype for months, TBWP finally opened in Australia.  I tried to keep an open mind, ignoring people who were really scared by it, or adversely thought it was totally boring.  I really enjoyed it.The whole concept of the film is probably its best feature.  It was extremely well marketed, prompting some people to think that it was real footage.  You believed that you were watching three students lost in the woods, experiencing genuine fear and anger.  Anyone who has ever camped in a forest will relate to strange noises in the night, and how scary they can be.It isn't for the unimaginative, who has seen every scary gory horror flick, and wants to have everything laid out for them.  Your own imagination is what makes this film so frightening.  Aside from personal opinions on how scary it is, the concept is excellent.  Very original and simple.  One of the lowest budgeted films to come out this year, but very entertaining, proving that you don't need mega-bucks to tell a good story, or give people a few moments of terror.I was freaked out by it more than I realised.  Especially when night fell tonight, and I walked to my car.  Recommended for those who want something different, but it is worth seeing, just so you can say that you've seen it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I wish I hadn't known,"When Blair Witch was released in Europe, it was inevitable to go to see it with a high level of curiosity and expectations, given all the rave reviews and incredible box office numbers it got in the States. Unfortunately, one of the things we were hearing about it was not correct: that it was a horror movie.Because I don't think it is, or at least that it doesn't respond to the perceived conventions of that genre. Blair Witch IS a superb exercise of growing tension, suspense and anguish, with an increasingly oppressive atmosphere which gradually grips you and drags you into the nightmare that these three kids, normal people like you and me, suddenly find themselves in. You know as little as they do, and you don't need any more, because your imagination does the rest. And your perception of the film gets even better the more you think and reflect upon what you have seen. I was entirely satisfied. But this is undoubtedly an arthouse film, and it seems to me that many people had misguidedly gone to see it expecting a slick, popcorn-friendly, Kevin-Williamsonish scare-fest with lots of surprise shocks and a blood-drenched grand finale. Which it certainly is not. Therefore, I can understand why so many complain about it having disappointed them so much.For me, only one thing could have made it better: having been able to see it without knowing it was fake, like the first people who saw it in the States did. When I came out of the cinema, a couple of ladies behind me, who had somehow managed to avoid all the hype and press coverage, were asking with worried faces ""...but did they ever find the bodies?"". And I envied them deeply.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Best film ever?,"No. It was appalling. The plot premise was so thin that you could see through it. The likelihood of there being one, let alone three Americans that do not have a mobile phone is laughable. The production values are atrocious and the so-called ""scary"" scenes were about as scary as Scooby-Doo. As for Heather Donahue being nominated for an Oscar, that would make a mockery of the awards. She would be being congratulated for acting when all she was doing was portraying herself as she had no idea what was going on anyway. The only people that deserve awards for this film are the directors who were incredibly successful in utilising the Internet to hype a poor product to the extent that the entire American nation and most of the world have been sucked in.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Cool Movie, way out there","I recently saw this movie and loved it solely because of the way it was filmed. I honestly don't think it was scary, except for the end which I SO won't tell, but if it had been filmed in another form besides with lousy cameras by a bunch of kids, the movie wouldn't have the same impact. It seemed so real because of that. I enjoyed it very much, but i think people have to look at it as a film acheivment rather than an actual motion picture.People I know either laugh or shudder when I told them I was going to watch this movie, so I really didn't know what to expect. I had heard that it seemed so real from a few people that I really wanted to watch it. I don't scare easily, so I congratulate the makers of this movie for making me think and completely getting inside my head. Movies like this where you can not separate what is fake from what is really going on never cease to amaze me.If you liked this movie, rent The Exorcist, too...the only other movie I've ever been scared of.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I should have warned you!!!,"My apologies to all those Cinema goers in the rest of the world. I feel as though you should have been warned you that if you go to see this 'home video, you'll feel as though you've been hugely ripped off. I did! I saw BWP in my local cinema; a place where I have known people to stand and applaud at the end of a film (sad but true). The only reaction when this one finished was an audible groan and mutterings of 'was that it?'.The best way to describe it is annoying. The jumpy, grainy picture is annoying. The constant bickering and profanity is annoying. The huge holes in the story (go downstream!!) are annoying and, above all, the totally unsatisfactory ending is annoying. I sat and watched past the credits just in case they'd snuck something in to explain what had been going on!OK, having said all of the above, it does have one thing going for it. It's got people talking about films (at the time of typing, there are over 1900 other comments posted).

How bout this being almost the worst movie I've ever seen if it isn't the worst.,"I'll start off by saying that these hand camera movies always revolve around a horrific storyline, like say, there just happens to be a random witch living in the woods and Cloverfield sucked as well. There is nothing even remotely scary about this piece of trash, not to mention it is terribly unrealistic. By the time this so called ""film"" was over, I was literally thinking ""Wow, I can't believe I actually just wasted an hour and a half of my life on that!"" Literally, the whole movie is just the people walking through the woods screaming the f word at the top of their longs for 81 minutes! I'd love to tell you the stupid ending as well, but I'm afraid I can't because IMDb won't let me. In short, don't waste your time and money on this garbage.Oh yeah, I got the DVD for free. I regret it, and I threw it away.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I'm still convinced it's true!,"I, unlike most normal people went into this movie blind as to what it was even about. I had no clue what to expect. In fact, from the beginning of the movie to the end, I believed that what I was seeing on the screen was real. For this reason, I was pretty freaked out. I'm not a person that's easily fooled, but I definitely got taken for a ride on this one. I don't regret for one minute that I thought the whole story line was true film footage from a true documentary. It enhanced my fear and made me feel for the characters. This film could be compared to camping in the woods what Jaws was to swimming in the ocean! I'm impressed!",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

It was excellent and exciting!,"I thought that the BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was very exciting. It was an excellent movie. This movie really scared me and I could not sleep after watching it. It was the thought of not seeing the witch that scared me most. It sent shivers down my spine. I watch a lot of scary movies, they're my favorite, and out of all that I have watched I'd have to say that THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was the BEST! It kept me wondering. I thought that all the actors in this film were really good. The way they expressed their anger and fears to one another seemed real, like they were actually being scared to death. To those who have not seen this movie, make sure that you watch the beginning. If not, then you won't get the movie. The beginning tells you about the things that the Blair witch has done to others and explains the events that happen later in the movie. If you don't see this part you will become confused!

It's all about mood and atmosphere with The Blair Witch Project,"Three film students set out into the woods in Maryland in search of the mythical Blair Witch. They document their journey via a video camera, but soon begin to regret ever venturing into the woods...By now many of us know the formula for these type of films; students interview people on whatever local legend they are investigating, they set off and all is well to begin with, they argue, run into problems etc etc. What we have to remember is that The Blair Witch Project was the first of its kind in this respect and still remains the benchmark of this genre...Although the idea of a bunch of students wondering round the woods filming trees, streams and each other doesn't sound like a great idea on paper in the Blair Witch Project it does actually work surprisingly well. There's a believability to the characters; I was sold on them being good friends and was sold on the peril that they find themselves in. As they get further into the woods, their friendships become tested as each look to blame the other for the predicament that they find themselves in.The characters in this film do make some daft decisions (which normally would be problematic), but given the fact that they are clearly tired, hungry and thirsty it's not really surprising that they aren't thinking entirely straight; it's like that scene where they're all convinced that they've gone round in a circle and are back at the same log... was that really the case or did they simply believe that they were back in the same place? The likelihood is that they had gone back to the same place, but as I say the mind can play funny games if it's not properly rested and taken care of.Those who are looking for a film with frequent jump scares may be a little disappointed with The Blair Witch Project as it really isn't that sort of film. It's more of a character-driven psychological affair which gets under your skin because you feel scared for the characters; they end up lost which is scary enough whether or not The Blair Witch actually exists. Having said that it certainly has its moments (many of the night-time scenes are pretty creepy and there's enough breaking of twigs and unexplainable noises to hold the interest). The grand finale in the house is also well-staged and well-shot with some good night cinematography.The Blair Witch is a winner for me, but it's mostly down to the characters, the mood and the atmosphere. Whilst it only really has one or two truly nervy scenes when they do arrive they are effective. The only problem with The Blair Witch Project is that it paved the way for many inferior copy-cat films in the intervening years.If you want to see how and where it all began then I'd strongly advise you check out The Blair Witch Project; it will also demonstrate how found-footage films should be made.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Hands down the scariest film ever made,"Many may find the shower scene in Psycho, the shark attacks in Jaws, the breakdown of Jack Nicholson in The Shining, or Hannibal Lector in Silence of the Lambs more creepy than this indie film, but I disagree.  Never before have I felt so uncomfortable, so shocked, so disturbed, and so intense after seeing this film.  And for some reason, after feeling all that even now (4 days later), I'm dying to see it again.The Blair Witch Project is best left unknown for those who haven't seen it. The less you know about the film the better, because some of the best parts would feel rather lame if you knew it was coming.  The last 45 minutes of the film I sat there with my hand over my mouth wandering what would happen next and truly caring for the students.  There wasn't a script written for this film nor was there a storyboard to decide the events, it is all incredibly realistic with no hocus pocus or special effects.  It costs the price of a car to make this film and it shows how brilliant the directors are when someone like Wes Craven or John Carpenter can't come close to frieghtening us as much as this film does, despite the millions they can put into their films.Not everyone will like this film, however those who don't like it can't criticize it.  For those that think they can, they minus well shut the hell up and look at the originality and differences this film has to every other horror film out there.  This is definatly a film to see in theaters because not only is the sound an important aspect of the film but it's so amazing to sit there and notice how quiet a sold out audience will be while watching this film, you could hear a pin drop.

"Overrated, boring and funny","From the bad acting to the I'm-not-sure-it's-on-purpose amateurish direction, this is one of the most jaw-droppingly awful movies to come out in years. I didn't find it the least bit scary, namely because everything looked fake and the acting was remarkably bad. It was obvious from the start that the film wasn't ""real"" because most people would have genuine believable fear and sadness when faced with death.People say that the fear generated came from not seeing what the horrific things were. This just made it vague: the characters are frightened by disembodied voices and scary images that you can't hear and never see--it's confusing, not terrifying. I was bored to death and kept looking at my watch. That ain't good, cause it's less than an hour and a half.""Blair Witch Project"" was all hype and not good.

First class scares without Hollywood clichés.,"Though Heather Donahue's performance was at some points frustrating and seemed forced, there's no denying that ""The Blair Witch Project"" delivers first class scares without the need of blood, gore or a physical monster. This is the reason why the movie stands out because it leaves aside all kind of Hollywood cheese. Also, it helps to make all scares psychological, leaving everything to the imagination of the viewer.The movie helped popularize the ""found footage"" style, which is its core; making you feel as lost, desperate, and frustrated as the characters.

From the prospective of a common boy scout these supposedly ""College"" students made every mistake as could be made by even the most stupid junior cub-scouts. Their purpose was to travel, via outdoors backpacking to the legendary ghost site of the famous Blair Witch and to ascertain her possible authenticity. As the viewer travels along with them, one wonders if they left their brains in neutral or just back in their dorms. Even Gilligan would not have been that dumb to carry out their own demise, not from the confrontation of the Witch, but with their own ignorance.

An Educational experience,"I got to see this film after my brother's room mate and his girlfriend remembered the occasion of seeing it at a Home cinema in a cabin. I had heard very much about the title. Even at a Media class at my university the professor mentioned 'Blair Witch project' for the hand-held camera view. Also one of my friends came into making some short movies about campus and stuff, and he was really into it, so one day he said: ''Rei, let's make a movie, I mean a real feel movie, OK - not quite as Blair Witch project- but still...After all this I just couldn't stand missing out on a influential piece of culture. The film itself is just one hour and a quarter long, but I guarantee you would want it to end way before and have impulses to check your watch.The footage found from three (probably cinema) students that wanted to make a documentary over the legend of the Blair Witch, and for the purpose they went into the woods of Maryland to find evidence.I really liked this movie! As a horror film it is a favorite. All classic horror movies are just ""directed"", they build the tension through some events the director chooses and the actors behave as if wanting to get your chills going. Well, in Blair Witch all that happens is perfectly - and I mean it - normal.Just remembering the decline the group suffers, that you might think the guys will resort to inhuman acts to survive (probably in a Hollywood movie this would have been sought - but here the mere idea of it is oh so creepy).It is as if I were in the group. The movie tempts me: 'Rei, what would have you done in this situation?' That's why it's so great and I preferred it so much.After seeing it for the evening of course I couldn't get to sleep. I actually myself got going in the genre, so I put some fragments of classics, The Exorcist and The Shinning. Apart from just scenes in which the scare is inevitable, these look like toy inventions: they want to find a better way of scaring you. They just pale in comparison...I don't mean to ignorant, but 'Blair Witch' is something that gets a special place in one's memory. It's a story. It's not a directed story, the interesting facts in and cinematic achievement to be remarked. It's a story that gets you gripped and it has full effect.

Fear of the Unknown,"The Blair Witch Project came out of nowhere for me. I was young when it was released, thus, all of the marketing and hype went over my head. I didn't see this film until long after the buzz had died down, about three or four years ago.Even then, I knew The Blair Witch was something special. I was still relatively new to horror films, but I knew that nothing had been done quite like this before, and never so effectively.There are no Hollywood gimmicks and touches here. It's not glamorous, the characters aren't typical teens in Hollywood horror, their existence isn't to pad the body count. We see these three people go from confident and determined documentary makers to the brink of madness. We live through this with them, we are THERE with them in the woods, which is what makes their experiences, and ultimately their fate, that much more terrifying.I think the fear we all share as humans is not being able to see what is unsettling us. Things always seem much less frightening after you turn the light on, and in the daytime. In the dark, we are at our most vulnerable. We are essentially, blind. Couple that with the fear of being removed from our comfort zone and there you have it; the fear of the unknown.Someone or something is making those horrible sounds in the woods. Someone, or something left those pile of rocks outside the tent. Someone, or something led them to that house. Someone, or something was hunting them in those woods. But we can't see who or what. We're just like Mike and Heather. Blind.The severe backlash this film has received, has kept it from reaching it's true place amongst the horror greats, in my opinion. Some people scoff at the idea of The Blair Witch Project being listed as one of the greatest horror films of all time. ""The Shining"" was panned on its release. Over 25 years later, it's viewed as a classic.In years to come, I hope people look back at this film. I hope people study (or restudy, as may be the case) what makes it work so well. The Blair Witch Project has cemented its place in independent film-making history. My wish is that someday it receives the true recognition and status it deserves.We won't see anything like this again, this was catching lightning in a bottle. Those of you who feel that creeping fear in the pit of your stomach as Mike and Heather enter the house, know exactly what I'm talking about. To those of you who don't feel the panic, the helplessness of this situation, the pure FEAR in those woods, I can safely say, it's your loss.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The first and only.,"It is every film makers dream to spend a few thousand dollars on equipment, round up some student actors and shoot for 8 days in order to make a film that grosses over $250,0000US.I remember when this film was released and people were trying to work out if it was real or not.The main thing to remember is that ALTHOUGH it's obvious that it isn't real, creating the possibility to some that was is real, is the reason this film grossed $250,0000US! They won't be able to do this type of ""thriller"" again because everyone will remember the blair witch project!

Oh my god, that's soooo scary. The only thing that should have scared those 3 people was when the other 2 found the guy's who disappeared tongue. Even when they found his tongue wasn't scary. It was just gross. Everyone I know who saw this movie agreed with me. This movie is a disgrace. And now they're making a Blair Witch 3 after the 2nd one was a flop. Get a clue!

As a true horror movie buff, I totally appreciate and respect this movie.  It seemed like everyone came out of the theather with different reviews.  One guy a few rows back threw up ... I am not sure if it was from the movie or the stale popcorn.

The creative risks pay off.,"Sometimes I can't help but believe that people who claim that this film is ""not scary at all"" are really just resentful of how boldly the makers of the film broke the rules. Not ever seeing the evil in a film is much more shocking than any visible form that evil could take. I believe that an attempt to show us the Blair Witch, regardless of how inventive and disturbing this portrayal would have been, would have hurt the film. The makers of The Blair Witch Project rely on the imagination of the viewer to contribute to the true horror of the film. Is it presumptuous of me to suggest that those who don't find this movie frightening lack the insides that make real fear possible?Another complaint I don't understand is that the acting is bad; I thought the performances were excellent. The Heather Donahue monologue that imbeciles have been so eager to parody is astounding. The detail of showing the mucus on Donahue's tear-stained face is strikingly honest - and woefully underappreciated.Finally, I will admit that it is highly improbable that one would make sure to bring a camera when fleeing for one's life. Here is a definite technical flaw. But when compared to the towering creative merits of this film, such a problem seems pretty insignificant. It does to me, at least.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Now that the hype's gone...it's Brilliant!,"I was expecting crap! I heard so many bad reviews about this film that I didn't expect much from it at all. I was pleasantly suprised.This film is brilliant and vividly scary! I can't believe so many people bagged BWP! It was made with a low-budget, broke all the traditional rules of the horror film genre and bought us something new and different.People were actually complaining about the fact it wasn't 'real', yeah well so what! The point is, if you watch BWP and you attempt to believe it's 'real', eventually the line between fiction and reality become blurred in this cleverly constructed film. I knew it wasn't real from the start, but it was so convincingly made, that it became very scary indeed.I liked the clever use of the two cameras, and I even liked the filmmaker's excuse for the overuse of the cameras incorporated into the narrative (through the character, Heather)! Although there is some flaws (i.e. constant use of cameras especially when you need both hands free), this film is a totally inspirational film to any would-be student of film-making. ****1/2 out of *****!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Good movie,GREAT concept and promotional push","Now somewhat expected in scary movies,around 1998 filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez made the daring and clever move of not only creating a singular camera,FX-free horror film with unknown actors(which may've as much been the end product of being relative first-timers of movie making as it would be credited to being ingenious,to be sure)but also going to work promoting the film as if it were a real occurrence,replete with its own website,its own history,documentation,and plenty(and I mean PLENTY)of interviews and fake newscasts. By the time of it's running,thru a number or film festivals and word-of-mouth promotions thru the early part of 1999,the movie was a virtual dynamo of anticipation when it finally landed in commercial theaters a week or two after the 4th of July that year.For the most part,it feels like a lot of invention and inspiration for a movie that,while inspired and effective enough,seems to be really challenging the viewer to love it or hate it. When I first saw it eleven years ago,I was much more in the ""love it"" camp. Upon re-watching it in full more recently,I'd more put it in the ""solid like"" category.Treated,at its broad-frame as a sort of ""Super documentary"",it portends to show the film of an attempted documentary of three film students from Baltimore(Heather Donahue,Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard--all using their real names and not seemingly attempting to show any distinction that would give them away as actors)who go on the trail of the rural legend of the Blair Witch,an 18th century woman who was cast into the woods of post-colonial Maryland,only to disappear and somehow,foist curse on the locals in neighboring towns. After roughly eight days of being lost in the woods somehow,the three understandably lose their cools,rationale and eventually much more as their uncanny knack to be tracked by someone(or something)in the woods has them unable to think clearly and,ultimately,escape.Plenty of ""cinema verite"" and improvisation(supposedly,the directors made the actors merely react to situations by leaving index cards along the woods telling them of what was happening next)made this simultaneously one of the more organic and unnerving films made.My lessening of enchantment of this movie is mostly from the passage of time,a chance to digest all the elements of the film/story and the re-evaluation of camera and filming tactics,which,while appreciable for their lack of excess and attention to more intangible fear and atmosphere,seem to be challenging the viewer in ways that threaten to break the viewing experience as well as enhance it.Extras on the DVD are a real plus:getting to see much of the back-story attached to this show is a largely satisfying element(and also gives me some insight into a couple of less-than-flattering reviews)to accompany a film that may seem a bit thin or ""naked"" on its own. An inspiration for ensuing ""shocker"" movies to come(Cloverfield,Quarantine,Paranormal Activity,The Last Exocrcism come to mind),this movie is worth a look,though the cleavage of opinion on it is gonna be quite difficult to overcome. Back then,a near ten;now,a weak seven. A keeper? You be the judge.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Scary? Not in the Least. Unintentionally Funny? You Bet.,"There is a craze that is currently sweeping the country, or maybe it's more like some type of misdirected phenomena.  It's called ""The Blair Witch Project,"" and it has received almost as much hype as that long-awaited ""first"" entry in the ""Star Wars"" saga.  Make no mistake about it; the Blair Witch is definitely something to marvel at, even if it's more for its utter stupidity than anything else.  Filmed in 16mm black-and-white, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is filmed like a documentary.  After about five minutes of watching the camera wobble from the ground to the sky and back to the ground again, the viewer is overcome by a splitting headache and a desperate urge to vomit.  Actually, much of the film is spent with the camera directed at the ground, leaving the viewer to wonder if the filmmakers were looking for the Blair Witch or merely looking for rare species of ants.  With a running length of 87 minutes, approximately 75 minutes of this time is consumed with the student filmmakers, who are the center of this lowly production, running around in the woods, lost, screaming obscenities at each other.  One is left to wonder that if they would have shut up and actually walked for a little while, they would probably have stumbled upon a strip mall within 5 minutes. But that obviously wouldn't be interesting enough. So forward we trek with our documentary crew, fully absorbed in the frightening reality of their situation.  While the threesome soon run out of food and supplies, the camera continues to roll, as if it's powered by a nuclear generator.  I don't want to give away any more details about this ""fright-fest,"" but let's just say that the three leads in this film are intolerable at best, and are representative of everything that the youth of America stands for: incessant chain-smoking and rampant profanity.  How proud we are. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs.  I found myself highly anticipating this film upon its release, due to all the great thing I had heard about it.  After about 30 minutes, however, I was hoping that a fellow audience member would feel as cheated as I, and do everyone a favor and go on a mass killing spree in the theater.  The producers wish to promote this film by saying that it is ""the unseen terror"" in ""The Blair Witch Project"" that makes it so darn scary.  After viewing this travesty, though, it is my belief that the witch is never revealed simply because the movie was so damn low-budget.  1.2/5 stars.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Hungry, Cold, and Hunted","Three filmmakers go to the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland to shoot a documentary on a mysterious local legend but what they discover in the reenacted film, ""The Blair Witch Project"", is much more tragic than they could imagine.  This is a unique and terrifying film in which all that we see comes through the lens of two cameras that the three bring along - one, 16 mm black and white, for the documentary and the other, full video color, as a tag-along. This depiction is already spooky enough because the audience becomes voyeurs through the eyes and senses of these filmmakers; indeed, they accurately reflect upon this technique as a sort of filtered reality'. Therefore, we see a blending of the images of the two cameras which, while sequential in time, comes across as choppy rather than continuous because they decide when the camera should be turned on and when it should be off. This adds to the heightened suspense as the three people get totally lost in the forest and we never get a full picture of what is confronting them because our vantage point has been micro-sized to their level.  ""The Blair Witch Project"" is challenging, tricky filmmaking but it works because it is one of the few times in cinema that you can feel and experience what the participants are experiencing that very moment.  Toward the end of the film, one of the characters, Heather, looks into the camera and poignantly apologizes to each of the three mothers about how sorry she is in getting them all involved in a tragedy that she well senses.  That is a particularly powerful message about taking responsibility for one's actions.  For me, the appeal of ""The Blair Witch Project"" goes beyond the chills and frights of a brilliantly conceived form of cinematography.  It boils down to accepting failure as a necessary part of life, however tragic and final that might be.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Please!No movie is going to appeal to EVERYONE. Lesson number one, guys! Blair Witch is NOT meant to be conventional, or like your typical horror movie. There are no obvious and contrived jolts or scary moments to make you jump out of your seat. You want conventional, go see ""The Haunting"". The only thing that'll scare you about that movie is the money you wasted on it. Blair Witch is not about those silly little horror film conventions. It's not about a monster hunting three kids.

The first Found Footage horror movie I've ever seen,"This is the first time I've had the pleasure of seeing a Found Footage horror film and I'm ultimately satisfied. The fact that the whole film was shot using footage was interesting. How does this method suit anyone. I found it slightly odd at first as every moment was immediately cut, but after a while I got used to it. The beginning just introduces the plot and it wasn't anything special, but once the forest itself comes into play it gets more interesting. Then again, not for a while. It was intermittent at times. So this film kept switching my interest in different ways. One time it was fun and interesting enough, and one time it was a boring forest. But what was undoubtedly the best part was the ending, which I devoured, and in fact it was the good ending that made it a good horror movie for me in the end.

Great suspense!,I am disappointed that most of the people who have seen this movie did not like it. You all seem to be brainwashed by the special effects and blood and gore that modern movies today have to offer. This is just showing how much the media is exploiting violence and how one by one we are becoming immune to the extent that is portrayed. Blair Witch is a refreshing change from all the bulls**t trash that we devour every year. A film doesn't necessarily have to have a $100 million+ budget and an arrangement of machine guns to be a masterpiece. Blair Witch plays with the mind psychologically. It isn't a case of when the 'scary' moments are ( I am referring to several comments that other people have posted) but what the it is and what it will do next. The beauty of it was how it was made and set out. I am a 15 year old female so my opinion probably is of no value to you but I can tell you I seem to have understood more of this film than most of you.,10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Great lore... Okay movie,"The Blair Witch Project is an interesting film for me; it has an interesting story,
a wonderful marketing campaign behind it, a chilling ending and great realism, but the film itself isn't that interesting.Once one starts looking into this this movie, it can really fall apart.

In my opinion, the film does drag, but the lore, as I said, has more impact than the actual movie. I love the ending, though.In retrospect, the movie itself isn't great, but it has creepy marketing and lore behind it.

A movie that will scar you if you let it,"For all that have been disappointed by horror films as of late should definitely see The Blair Witch Project. As we are seeing the events unfold in the first person, as well as seeing them through Hi8 video/16MM film, the realism is increased. Not to mention that at times, the actors actually show their descent into madness with each passing day. The more strange occurrences happen, the more the actors look like they are loosing their grip on reality. This translates perfectly into the audience's perceptions, and a hushed pandemonium grips the viewers. When I saw the New York advanced screening, everyone left the theater white faced and totally drained from the culmination of the picture. I don't want to give out too much about the plot, but the tag line says it all, and the ending will be the most horrific ending that anyone has exposed on film.

Take a little trip into the woods.,"""I'm afraid to close my eyes. I'm afraid to open them.""The Blair Witch Project was the first really popular ""found footage"" movie of my generation, and Cloverfield, Paranormal Activity, Quarantine, and other movies owe a lot of their success to this low-budget flick. If was mega-popular (though divisive) when it was released in 1999, but is it still chilling when watched today? For the most part, yes.What makes The Blair Witch Project effective is the great way that atmosphere and fear of the unknown are used, as well as how well the three actors sell their frustration, unease, and finally, terror. As the three amateur filmmakers get more and more lost in the woods, their anger and annoyance at one another and their situation does a great job of raising the tension. Add that to the local legends that they were exposed to before venturing out into the wilderness and the odd, disturbing events that start happening each night, and you've got a pretty creepy little film.The key to enjoying movies like The Blair Witch Project is how easily you can suspend your sense of disbelief and just go with what you're seeing. If the movie can draw you in, you'll probably have a good time with it. I didn't have a hard time putting myself in the shoes of our trio, and I know that if I had been in their situation, I would have been well and properly freaked out.

"Here we go, a  walkin' in the woods","By now, everyone and their grandma has heard about this super-cheap project that ended up making millions upon millions in the summer of '99. Now it's out on video and that's where it really belongs: it was mostly shot on HI8 Video, with some 16mm film. Watching it, especially the beginning (before the 3 characters go into the woods), I am reminded of similar video footage I took on a couple of past road trips; you know what I mean? - stuff taken from a moving car; people walkin' around not really doing anything. The difference is, of course, I didn't make $140+ million off of my stuff. Silly me. As a film, it's a mixed bag. The 1st 20 or so minutes, as I mentioned, are nothing more than a boring home movie. But then, the tension starts to mount - and I'm not really sure why: is it the jerky hand-held camera movement? The 'real world' sound effects? After all, one is supposedly watching real stuff, not a make-believe reel movie. That was the whole hook of the project - the thing that drew so many people to it (I believe the technique is called 'cinema verite' - a French term for realism). And, true to form, the film doesn't really 'end' - it just stops. There are no spelled-out answers in the end, forcing audiences to make their own conclusions (I did). But, also in the end, I don't think this will take its place among classics such as Night of the Living Dead[68] or even The Evil Dead[81], because the thing's a triumph of marketing, not cult horror. It's clever, it's creepy, it's unique. But it's a manipulation designed to draw grosses, not gross out people in a new exciting way (the R rating is for foul language). OK, I bought the DVD.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Nice and spooky,"This was a very worthwhile movie, very different to the 'Scream' generation horror flicks. Instead of 'in your face' scares every two minutes, we were treated to a delicious psychological build up of unease, culminating in that wonderfully 'open to interpretation' ending. I agree that the main characters are sometimes 'stupid', but maybe that was because they're human? It's not the best horror film by any means, but a very notable addition to the genre. That it cost practically nothing to make goes to show that you don't need a $200 million budget to win at the box office....just a good idea and good execution.....(although a massive publicity campaign can help I suppose)....don't go and see it expecting to be scared every two seconds, go and be 'nicely' disturbed for 80 mins or so...",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Birth of the Docu-Horrors,"The film ""The Blair Witch Project"" ushered in a new wave of self-shot horror films, of which the ""Supernatural Activity"" franchise is the most well-known. The idea of documentation fiction was born here, and showed that it was possibly to scare the pants off people with just a small crew and little money. It defied big budget films upon it's release.What struck me as most interesting about this particular film was the marketing behind it. The partnership with this film and the Sci-Fi Channel's ""Curse Of..."" was a phenomenal success and really blurred the line between what was fact or fiction, resulting in a wide following believing the theatrical release of ""The Blair Witch Project"" to be a true documentary and not fiction at all, because they had seen a ""documentary"" on the making of this ""real"" story on television.While having watched the Sci-Fi Channel's feature greatly added to the fright of the theatrical film with it's background story, those that didn't watch that TV feature might lose out on some of the subtle plot-horror taking place, most notably in the end where Heather finds her friend standing in the corner. If you know the background story of that from ""Curse of..."" it really amps up the situational horror.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Just pure morbidity is what keeps us watching this,"This is an amateur film. It's simple. It's just like a documentary. When we watch this ""film"", we feel a strange morbid curiosity on what's appearing on the screen, very similar to a voyeur's curiosity. I knew it was a fiction, but I tried to believe it was real (that's what it was supposedly made for, wasn't it?). Once I found myself believing what I was watching, I entered into the atmosphere, and this is what I found: morbidity, just that. Ah, and lots of boring minutes of footage, which will scare us only if we think that they are real footage images, where everything could happen as they are real.All in all, this is my conclusion: This isn't a horror movie, the same way that porno movies aren't erotic films. I could call this a ""hardcore horror film"", and I find this idea pretty disturbing. I can't imagine what kind of films are to come in this line but with higher budgets. Perhaps a pseudo-snuff movie...? Too much for my sensibility.I gave it a 6 out of 10, and I still don't know why I didn't give it a 1.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Sure it's cheap, but not in a bad way.","After reading through multiple IMDB user posts on this movie, I wasn't sure if this low budget film would be one of the best and scariest horrors ever, or just a boring and laughable attempt at moviemaking.  Which was it? Number 1, all the way!  This was the best horror movie I've ever seen, even surpassing the original Psycho. With an extremely original approach this movie succeeded in engrossing me. Then it freaked me out!  It was one of the scariest movies ever, with an equally freaky ending.  In fact, I was quiet for hours afterwards, not wanting to break the spell it put me in, I just sat and analyzed the ending. This movie is NOT for everyone.  If you prefer pointless, bloody, and need I say FAKE, slasher films, you'll probably shun this ""imposter"" to the horror genre.  I thought it was delightfully original, with wonderful acting, and a seamless and completely believable plot.  That's why I gave it a 9 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

yeah I'd love to be i the woods with these guys        !!!NOT!!!,These film makers are so annoying they get upset at the littlest things. Yes its clever and spooky but every time something happens their all like OH GOD OH NO WHATS HAPPENING! Some rocks are moved or their's sticks that look like shapes and it has to be the witch not some pranksters or someone in the group. I Did like how the movie was like a real investigation of a legend like Bigfoot the Bell witch or a Chupacabra they interviewed locals some didn't believe It some where sure it existed some thought it was based on a true event but there was no witch.

Not as scary as I'd hoped,"I am not the kind of person who likes to be scared, but I went to see The Blair Witch Project for a discussion group.  This is the story of three film students (Heather, Josh and Mike) who hike into the Maryland woods to do a documentary on the infamous Blair Witch who has supposedly haunted the woods for about a century.  The film started out well and I loved the three film-makers.  The interaction between the three of them and the change of emotions through the weekend of filming were wonderful.  However, considering the film was promoted as one of the scariest movies ever, I have to say that I was more than disappointed.  I have to be the easiest person in the world to scare and yet this film did nothing for me.  There are far more intensely scary films out there, and although this would be in the same genre, it is certainly not in my top ten (which is headed by The Exorcist). Having said that, it is worth a look just to appreciate something without all the Hollywood special effects.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
points for PR,"Perhaps it's just me, but I didn't find this film all that frightening. Maybe there is a sort of fundamental difference in how Europeans and North Americans respond to this sort of material, based on our cultural heritage? Personally I grew up reading the original Grimm Brothers (rather crude material for a five-year-old) and Disney always struck me as preposterous and stereotyped. So this was hardly anything new. What was new however, was how it was marketed, - and I congratulate the filmmakers on one terrific PR-job. This one must go down in history, I'm sure. I remember seeing the fake documentary about the fake film on TV - and it was severely scarier than the film itself. I guess that was somehow the point. Anything to draw us in. Who cares what we think once we've bought the ticket. The film itself resembled some sort of psychological study more than anything else. Some have complained about the language, but I doubt I'd be any less foulmouthed if I was in the characters' situations - or even the actors' for that matter. I just might whine a little less, but perhaps it actually adds to the credibility of the film to have American college student behave like crybabies. The film did have some finer points however, like the scene where the camera is finally being turned around at 'Heather' and we see her being tormented (by now, I am sure we have all been ardently awaiting it). If anyone still wants to go see this film, I suggest you leave before the end because it will only annoy you, in some desperate attempt of tying the storyline together. Common now - what storyline? Please. You might as well not have bothered. Never the less; my unreserved congratulations to Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez.

Go and see it anyway,"In my humble opinion this movie suffers in two respects because a) there's too much hype and b) to what film genre do you assign it?Forget about the hype and ask yourself a simple question.  Do you want to spend a few pounds/dollars watching a film probably unlike anything else you've seen? Be advised that it's not an ""in your face"" film.  Be advised that, like my wife, you may be physically sick during/after watching it (simply due to the ""authentic"" but shaky filming).It does not conform to the current label of horror.  Not one of your slash, cut, blood, spurt models.  Its not ghost or monster film either.It's a psychological journey with a twist.  The twist being ""we're pretty sure that ghost and ghouls don't exist and there's an explanation for everything........ well almost everything"".In commenting on this film most people have concentrated on the ""horror"" element.  Equally thought provoking for me is the degeneration of the characters who are unable to cross the short but elusive bridge back to civilisation.As an avid and regular cinema goer what pleased me is that it isn't another Hollywood jukebox film.  You know what I'm mean!  What do I fancy tonight? Action?  Then choose option A1, A2, A3 or A4.  Comedy?

I'm Glad I Never Get To See The Witch,"I really like how this movie starts. Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez did a good job with the realization of characters. Then providing us this absence of horror, adding some ""heyyahs"" in there. The town folk all seem out of there minds, circus-like, and seem to all know important facts about the ""The Blair Witch Project."" One guys says that a lot of people say the woods are ""all haunted,"" then takes it back and says there not. The part about the camera and how it works was a great add on. I like how they are all friends, too.   I'm just picturing these students getting together and saying, ""you guys want to go to the woods and make a really cool film."" The way this film starts out really makes the film fun and interesting. I know I already said that, but it does. It has a very simple compositional-style and flow too. Everyone is lost in this film, unfortunately, and cannot be found. - Because they were lost before, and now they decided to make a documentary about a WITCH.  Think of the joy of being in a really cool film, lol. Hell, I would have liked to do this project with them. And, I like how the light in this film bounces off things such as, the suns rays. Heather has a good voice for the main narrator of the project. Her take is, ""I don't know"" when asked if the witch exists. She is like the facilitator of a stupidity. The map adds a great conflict piece, a disappointment. I mean could this film be better? could it be set in a mental asylum? Myrick and Sanchez decide to add some good ideas in this film, like the rock piles, her puppy dog beanie, colors of the tent. You sense the discomfort of the actors. They should've brought some broccoli along. These people are film students, but did their teacher assign them to this group, or do these people randomly know each other? Do we actually get to see them light a fire? Just like we don't actually see what Heather sees. The film draws good comparisons to insanity vs. feeling fatigued in the woods, all while disorientation is setting in. Heather says that ""movies are all she has left."" So, we wonder what happened to her art before? We are not sure what is wrapped in the bundle wrapped with Josh's necklace. So the film end when Heather is knocked out by something we never get to see. We know that two cameras must have been recovered. Great found footage type film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Reasonably tense mock documentary horror film,"Having been as curious as anybody else over the buzz this film has been generating ever since Sundance, I went to see it on opening day to see what the fuss is all about.  Some critics said that it's the scariest movie they've ever seen, even scarier than THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and THE EXORCIST.  Well, I wouldn't go THAT far.  This movie is extremely well-made and well-acted, and the filmmakers certainly deserve credit by stretching their shoestring budget extremely well.  The film is shot entirely with a video camera and a 16mm black and white film camera.  The woods where the three ambitious young filmmakers go to explore the Blair Witch legend are claustrophic and creepy.  The film borrows inspiration from many horror films such as THE EVIL DEAD, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, DELIVERANCE, FRIDAY THE 13TH, and I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. The difference here is that there is virtually no blood or gore on display, which will no doubt disappoint some viewers.  The emphasis is on the characters' psychological and mental deterioration as they get lost deeper and deeper in the woods.  The only complaint I have about the film is that it doesn't really pay off by the conclusion.  It builds a reasonable amount of tension, especially during the nighttime scenes, and we keep waiting for some big revelation, and we don't really get it.  Time and again scenes keep building and toying with us, and we expect to jump out of seats by something scary, but it never happens.  It's like watching a porno movie without any sex scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Modestly enjoyable,"It's not the first found footage movie, and it's not the best, but it is probably the most iconic. For good or for ill 'The Blair witch project' made a big splash when it was released in 1999, the subject of praise, criticism, and mockery in turn, and countless found footage flicks have followed in the years since. Between lack of interest or opportunity at varying points I've never actually seen it before, so even though I'm not watching with completely fresh eyes, it's high time that I saw it for myself. I do ultimately like it more than not, but it's a mixed bag.All due credit for ingenuity in terms of all the work that went into cementing the manufactured footage as authentic; this was surely one of the very first movies to employ such a clandestine campaign. Modest as the concept is, I think it's pretty solid. There was good work put in here, and some really good ideas. At select points a scene is able to provide some earnest uneasy chills by virtue of what is left unseen, or audio faintly heard; simple crafts that heighten the characters' fear and anxiety; and the capable improvisational skills of the cast, Heather Donahue especially. At its best, this ably meet its goal as a horror film.It's regrettable that the best value of 'The Blair witch project' is shuttled to the last twenty minutes of the feature. Before that the movie is a long slog of getting lost and arguing. Even as the characters sagely reflect that they should follow the creek to find their way - as basic as survival tips get - they pointedly fail to do so. Unsteady as the camerawork is, for the most part it's better than I expected, though there are absolutely instances where its' uselessly flailing like the worst criticism has long suggested. Meanwhile, after latching onto some creeping genre thrills in the last quarter, the picture ends rather limply. I fully understand the implications of the last scene, as it was plainly foreshadowed earlier - there's just not enough atmosphere or momentum for it to make the impression that's intended.For the best strengths that this carries, and the effort that was put into it, I want to like 'The Blair witch project' more than I do. Those strengths are weighed down by too many shortcomings for the movie to stand especially tall, however, and it doesn't leave a huge mark in its wake. I commend all involved for their contributions, not least filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez; when all is said and done I do think this is entertaining, and modestly worthwhile - just not altogether essential.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A meta-movie,"We all now the two legends: the one about the three students doing a documentary project on Blair Witch , and the one about the two wannabe billionaires doing a documentary project on three students doing a documentary project on Blair Witch. The first one doesn't have a happy end, the other one does. The idea of ""showing the students' filmed material"" as is is very effective in terms of creating terror among the spectators, and the result is purposedly shaky and non-professional, but unfortunately creates a lot of empty space, minutes of breathing into the microphone, panning of a forest without any signs of life (the trees included, due to the season). In Finland we have a theater/TV director called Jouko Turkka. His methods of making his actors act include (or rather: consist of) having them drool, make faces, sweat, shake their bodies and cry for extended periods of time, the story being of minimum importance. So, the BWP looks somewhat familiar to me. So familiar that I had to cut down some points.But: the movie really is scary.

Beware the hype,"I hate to leave myself open to the charge of being a wet blanket, but I've waited in vain to see someone else point out that this movie may well disappoint those who, like myself, had their expectations raised out of all proportion by the tremendous hype.  I'll say first off that BWP is well made, with convincing performances and a truly terrifying last 2-3 minutes. Otherwise, I found it a disappointment.Because so many reviews have hailed this as a deeply terrifying movie, I was actually afraid to go see it, being something of a wimp.  I need not have worried:  the film is tense, yes, even unpleasantly so, but the characters were not likeable enough to inspire great concern on my part, and the incidents that should have been frightening merely inspired interest and mild curiosity.The one judicious use of gore was genuinely creepy and well executed (as it were), and, as I've mentioned, the final sequence is deeply scary. I think, though, that the much-lauded absence of Hollywood fakery actually worked against this film's effectiveness with me.  The hand-held cameras actually made the entire film seem more artificial instead of more realistic, so that I was constantly aware that this was, indeed, only a film.  This is a shame, since the situation is so promising and truly ought to have given me the shivers.I offer my experience not to put down the many who have found the film everything it's cracked up to be, but only to suggest that for some--not all--viewers, it may not live up to their expectations.

"Should be ""The Blair Retch Project"" or...","...or maybe ""Three Potty Mouths in a Thicket.""When I went to see this movie, I expected to be frightened out of my mind.  Peter Travers, Rolling Stone's critic had called it ""Scary as Hell,"" so I was expecting to see one of the best horror films in my life -- and believe me, I am an avid horror fan and know the difference between true low-budget HORROR with the low-budget pansy horror displayed here. The film contians three annoying-as-hell characters which will grate on your nerves for the entire movie.  Indeed, most of what they do is not scary -- they just swear while screaming at the top of their lungs.  If anything in those woods, let alone the ""witch,"" could not hear them, I'd be surprised.  These characters not only yell for most of the movie, they are also some of the dumbest filmmakers I have ever seen -- I had a suggestion for them halfway through: if you would just shut up and actually start moving, you might ACTUALLY GET OUT OF THE WOODS. The producers of ""The Blair Witch Project"" believed that they could make a feasible film by sending three out-of-work pitsy actors into some woods without a script -- guys, it didn't work.  Many critics, for some reason, seemed to like this one.  Maybe they fell asleep and had a scary dream at their screening.  The public's reaction was nothing like this -- when I left the theater, all I heard was ""That sucked"" or ""What a waste of my money.""  Dedicated horror fans will definitely be disappointed -- maybe the critics liked it because it was a non-horror film billed as a straight horror film -- after all, how many critics have actually ever watched a horror film.

Don't believe the hype,"The question is this. Why was Blair Witch Project so successful? The answer is simple.

People say Hollywood insults their intelligence, but after the success of Blair Witch, I wonder if the mass audience has any intelligence to insult.This is an amateurish gimmick movie.

I did see some over-exaggeration at times, but nothing I was not expecting from a typical horror ambiance. An extra point goes for the actors' handling the cameras themselves. On the other hand, while suspense was the main element in the movie, I would have loved to see more frightening scenes, the ones that make you jump off the couch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Horror And/Or Hype?,"THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is one of those films that made history by shooting to the top of the box office while being made on a very paltry budget of just $40,000.  It also benefitted from all the hype surrounding its story of a group of teens who venture into the desolate Maryland woods to find out if the legend of the Blair Witch is fact or fiction.  As a result, this film went on to gross $130 million during the late summer of 1999.But while the premise of the story and the inventive ""Shaky-Cam"" work of the filmmakers suggest a very chilling and suspenseful film, I am only able to give this film a '6' rating out of 10.The reason?  Even for $40,000, you think it would be easier for filmmakers Eduardo Myrick and Daniel Sanchez to come up with a better use of dialogue than you'd get in an average teen-slasher pic.  The pacing of the film is unquestionably inventive, and the atmosphere, the further the teens venture into the woods, begins to resemble John Boorman's 1972 classic DELIVERANCE. The stick figures used as the signs of the Blair Witch's presence (the witch herself, in a thoroughly brilliant move, is never, ever seen) are also good; and the lack of explicit gore is quite refreshing.  But the dialogue is so profanity-ridden that it gets tired after a while.  It is worse than any of the screaming done by the film's lead heroine (Heather Donahue) or her ""I'm-so-scared""-by flashlight scene.Unlike a lot of people, I wouldn't call THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT an overhyped low-budget disaster; in terms of premise, it more than lives up to the hype. Even the acting of this amateur group is worth sitting through.  But unlike others, because of the dialogue (the one and ONLY reason this film has its 'R' rating at all), I can't quite call it a masterpiece.  Still, it is a worthy film, if frustratingly uneven.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Hype-a-rama,"Can we say ""Hallowe'en cash in"" children? Picture this: Film released in which some people go camping in the woods, get shouted at, strange things happen, find a house, film ends. Put it like that and the Blair Witch Project simplicity is revealed.  Not that I'm saying this is bad - simple can be good, and to be fair, as most lines were improvised, a simple plot can be turned into a fairly realistic film.  Note: fairly realistic.  No documentary team, no matter HOW amateur, would take footage as shakey as some of the Blair Witch shots.  OK, it's on a camcorder, but even so.  The word 'overplayed' springs to mind. The same rings true with the dialogue - the arguments seem drawn out, the emotion just somehow inappropriate, and the locations are simply dull. It has its good points though: the few scary bits ARE scary, and the implied witchcraft is intriguing spooky, but as a whole the movie just seems too bland for my liking. Fair play to the people who created it, on a small budget and amateur teams, but I  ain't gonna eat a cake just coz the cook is inexperienced and buys cheap ingredients.

A different kind of horror,"What's most scary, to actually see the thing that's hunting you or never see it. I choose option two, since you have no idea what's hunting these kids you have to picture it yourself, and we got more fantasy then anyone else to create your own fear.You probably know the plot already, 3 Kids is making a documentary about the Blair Witch legend, before going out in the woods they gather up some info for the film, some people actually said they've seen the witch, and they make their own description,which you can picture yourself how the witch looks. They kids, or they are more like youngsters, go out in the forest. They go lost and seems to walk around in circle whatever they go, on the night they hear horrific sounds and it seems like they are not alone out there, someone or something is haunting them.I'm not the horror kind of guy, but i heard of this movie and i decided to have a look. I saw clips in 7 parts on you tube (kinda lame i know :P) but i decided not to pay for anything i haven't seen yet. It gives you the thought, what's hunting these kids and why?

"If you go out in the woods today, you'll get a BIG SURPRISE...","""Blair Witch Project"" has come under a lot of heavy criticism for its many shortcomings, for its over-hyped/overcooked viral marketing campaign, and for its length (some critics seem to think it would have been much better as a 30 minute short subject). Many of these criticisms have merit. However, once I saw it (on VHS, long after the hype had died down), I enjoyed it quite a bit.The fact that I first saw it on VHS, on my living room television, may have had much to do with my positive reaction to it. Even though it is mostly set in the woods of Maryland, BWP's tiny cast and rough, grainy, under-lit feel lend it a curiously intimate quality, as of a ghost story told around a campfire at night...and I think this quality comes across better in a dark, silent living room than a large movie theater with dozens-to-hundreds of people in the place with you. I also think the grainy, cheap, hand-held feel translates better on the small screen. It's better than it deserves to be...you might think of it as one of those 'accidents' of film making like the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". In fact, I am pretty sure that the editors and the choices they made were what 'saved' this film from obscurity. Many slick film makers have tried to duplicate TCM, including its director, and no one has ever completely succeeded. I think the same is true here...the film makers got lucky and they knew it.Mostly, I think I enjoy BWP because I have a understand the true impact of the phenomenon that rangers and outdoors-men refer to as 'woods shock' - the devastating impact of being REALLY LOST in the woods. Modern urban dwellers can easily underestimate this impact and dismiss it because we've never been truly 'lost' in our lives. But many fit, experienced hikers and campers actually given up, laid down, and died from the stress of being lost in the North American forests and mountain ranges, often less than a day's hike from civilization and with supplies and rations still in their packs. The original meaning of the term 'bewilder' is to take someone out in the woods and get them lost, and leave them there...and it was first coined hundreds of years ago, by people who were much more comfortable in forests than we are now.So I think the basic story idea, of three callow film students going for a 'simple', ordinary overnight trip into the woods and stumbling into disaster makes for compelling viewing if it is handled right...and I feel that BWP use of the plot device of hand-held cameras (documenting their growing unease, bewilderment, and finally hopeless terror), is a brilliant stroke that sidesteps the issues of slick production work , professional sound work, 'good' acting, etc.Yes, there are some contrived elements that don't hold up to serious examination (especially the 'editting' of the film found in the cameras, which is much more 'dramatically apt' than a simple presentation of what happened), but that's true of almost any ghost story or horror story told around a campfire at night (""And there, on the handle...was a HOOK!!!"", etc. ""Like, I am sooooo sure...""). But I found the casts' reactions to their growing predicament credible and enjoyed the way the plot kept turning the screws on them tighter and tighter. And while the payoff may have been annoyingly ambiguous, jumbled, and hard to decipher, it was plain that something Very Bad Indeed had happened to the film students. The glimpses provided of the walls of the house where everything comes to an end are the materials for good old fashioned nightmare fuel. What WERE those markings on the walls???While the followup sequel was an unmitigated cinematic disaster, BWP succeeds as a nasty little ghost story and can be enjoyed on those terms.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

And not knowing beforehand if this was a real documentary allowed me to experience more fear in a movie theater than I have ever encountered before.The best way to watch this movie is to not know ANYTHING about it.  If you see an interview on TV- don't watch it.  Or an article in a newspaper- don't read it.And the worst thing you can do is compare it with other horror films. Unless you are a movie buff wizard, you have never seen anything like this before.Just go see this movie with no expectations other than you're going to be entertained.Trust me.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Not scary, but interesting","To get into this film, it's better that you understand what the filmmakers were aiming for.  Fortunately, there's no one ramming down my throat hyping the movie.  I've checked the Blair Witch website a little.  It sure has lots of amazing details.Anyway, onto the film itself.  The first half hour of the movie is disorienting what with the shaky handheld cam shots.  But this first half hour is essential to know the Blair Witch myth (wish I listened hard, heheh).  Then the next hour is where the transformation of the kids from happy, to whining annoyance uttering the F word plenty of times, and ultimately fear.I never got scared or made me think hard such as to lose sleep.  What it is, is simply an interesting way of making a movie.  That's it.  The actors don't have much of a script to work with and so most of the scenes are ad libbed.  And the story is constructed as a documentary.  At the end, you feel that you want to know more, but since it's a ""unfinished documentary"" the end is naturally abrupt.  This is one story best viewed on a TV screen IMO.The verdict: 3 of 5 stars.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
BRILLANT,"A landmark American film that challenges it's audience to let there imagination                              provide the real horror. We are watching the supposed footage of three film                              students who disappeared in 1994 while making a Documentary on a local legend                              called the Blairwitch. A local myth about a witch who was cast out by the town                              200 years before. The students are led by a determined young woman who wants                              to make her film at all cost. The trio starts out well enough but are soon reduced to                              three frightened and lost people who are faced with trying to maintain their sanity.                              They become aware that something or someone seems to be tracking there                              every move.

Originality makes up for quite an awful film.,"I gave this movie a 6.  And why? Why give The Blair Witch Project, a deserving winner of so many Razzies, and other ""worst films of 1999"" awards, a rating reserved for films that are simply ""not bad.""  The reason is, The Blair Witch Project is one of the most original movies ever made.  The ""acting"" is awful, but you have to give major props to a horror movie with no music.  You have to give major props to a movie that doesn't make itself, but sits back and lets a movie be made.  Its' original in that no other movie has sent a buncha kids out in the woods with CAMCORDERS and seen what they get out of it.  No other movie has paid their stars in sandwiches. These props made what probably should've been a 3 or 4 movie a 6.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Good student film, but nothing more","This movie was exceptionally over-hyped, even more so than Star Wars.  I felt that it was OK for a zero-budget movie made by a couple of film school students, but is certainly not deserving of the lavish praise it has received.  As a movie, it is poorly done in many aspects.  It is very boring at times and poorly paced.  The characters are never developed, so you really don't care what happens to them.  It is more scary than the recent batch of post-modern ""horror"" films like Scream, but does not come close to something like The Exorcist.  In fact, I thought that Event Horizon (a terrible movie, btw) was much scarier.  Catch this one on video.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Original but not very exciting,"Saw TBWP on DVD last night. I was a little disappointed after all the hype. First the good points. It's original - definitely not your formulaic, Hollywood fare. Great atmosphere - the music is really frightening and the footage looks authentic. Good acting - from everyone but especially Heather. It's short - 80 minutes. The DVD package is excellent - the movie, director's commentary, various trailers, BW myth, TV documentary. The user interface is also well done (very spooky). BUT... nothing really happens. That may have been OK when no-one knew anything about it but now that some of the story has leaked out (like the fact that it was the producers who spooked the campers) then something was lost. You couldn't help think ""I know who put that stuff there"". So it's a victim of its own success. I gave it 7/10 and it *will* remembered for a long time - but not because it's a classic horror movie - because of its originality. If you want classic horror watch Psycho or Halloween.

I was so afraid to be completely freaked out at the theater that I may have been expecting too much.  I walked out of the theater actually wishing that there were more ""night shots"" in the movie.

Well, not if you count the chilling peek the audience gets into their final days in the form of the footage shot by the filmmakers, as we watch with mounting suspense as they near their fates.What is so frightening about ""The Blair Witch Project"" is not what we do see in the end but what we don't. So abstract are the final minutes of film that the imagination of the audience is forced to take over, and that is the stuff that sleepless nights are made of.I can't guarantee that everyone will be scared or even amused by ""Blair,"" but I can tell you that I am not easily scared by a film, and this movie spooked me more than anything I have ever seen.

I am too scared to watch it a third time at the moment as the aura of the movie still haunt me. If watching it a second time doesn't affect you then, this is not the movie for you.

"It was absolutely stunning, intense, thrilling, frustrating and mesmerizing...it's also a masterpiece. One of my all time favorites for sure.","The Blair Witch Project (1999) is a DVD I own, and after recently retracing the film's iconic locations, I had to rewatch it. The movie centers around three film students investigating the mysterious disappearances of children in Burkittsville, Maryland. Rumor has it that the Blair Witch inhabits the nearby Black Hills Forest, and the film follows the students as they venture into the woods in search of clues.This movie was directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez in their directorial debuts and stars Heather Donahue (Taken), Joshua Leonard (Depraved), and Michael C. Williams (Altered).I vividly remember living in New York when a documentary aired about three kids who vanished in the woods, delving deep into the Blair Witch legend. At the end of the documentary, they teased this film, and I was living in Far Rockaway, Queens at the time. The excitement was unreal. Opening weekend, we went to Virgin Megastore in Times Square to see what would become one of the most groundbreaking horror films of its time.The sheer thoughtfulness behind the marketing, writing, and raw, found-footage style makes this movie an all-time great for me. That summer, everyone was asking, ""Was it real?"" It sparked endless conversations. The film is stunning, intense, thrilling, and at times, frustrating in the best way-truly mesmerizing.

One of the most effective horror movies ever made,"If you're a fan of horror movies then you absolutely must see this classic if you haven't already. In 1999 when this extremely low budget movie was released, it very quickly became a success, both with critics reviews and with the box office. It raked in over 140 million dollars. It was made for about 40 thousand dollars, it was literally all filmed by these three young people, this is the found footage category of horror films all began. We have the filmmakers of the Blair watch project to thank for movies like paranormal activity. I love scary movies like this! This is how you make an effective scary movies that actually scares viewers. Too many horror movies use buckets of fake blood, over the top effects, and show you exactly what you're supposed to be afraid of. This movie does none of those things, not a one of those tactics are exercised at any point. And not doing any of those things is what makes this film work and it's what made it so popular back in 1999. The performances by heather, mike, and josh are all so great, they're realistic and very believable. With this movie, if the performances by the three actors didn't work, then nothing would've worked at all because that's all it is. Seeing these actors reactions to the supposed horrors that are happening to them is what sends a chill up your spine. You hear one of the guys yelling for help at night and you hear far off creepy sounds. These things are effective because it's dark and you literally have no clue what it is you're supposed to be scared of. The stick figures hanging in the woods was a good touch too, it just added on to the eerie creepy factor. If you're going to watch a scary movie one night and you have yet to see this one, just give it a try I promise you won't be disappointed. And the ending is just the icing on the cake. It's done extremely well. 10/10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
the strength of the acting,"the BWP does little to terrify me, as i'm not convinced by the supernatural... relying so heavily on inbuilt fears instead of presenting a framework i can immerse myself in would always result in my apathy regarding ""scares""...having said that, BWP succeeds in a completely different way... it is (to me at least) a fantastic example of utterly convincing acting... completely organic and believable (except for kicking the map into the creek)...having said that there are some memorable visuals, and the final scenes are creepy if you allow them to play on your fear of real dangers... by this point though, you either feel the threat is supernatural or not... i felt it did stem from an otherworldly source, and thus it was critical to the idea of what type of ""horror"" movie i was watching...this movie is out and out a drama centering on group dynamics in the face of a life threatening situation... the disintegration and loss of the ""public face"" is brilliantly done... as a small survival drama, the BWP is bleak, unforgiving, and hard to bear...it also touches on the impact of the camera, what we show and hide, how we see the world and our right to report from behind a lens...i would never recommend this as entertainment... it is a tour de force, but it is demanding... watch with care...",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Great Concept!,"I understand this flick is not for everyone, but I think it is one of the best *films* -- not just suspense/horror films -- I've seen in a long time, and an antidote for those of us long jaded by Hollywood formula films. You might not like it, especially if you were expecting the formula, but if you are looking for something fresh and creative AND very very scary, I can recommend this one highly.  The concept -- the actors actually filmed most of the footage since they are supposed to be making a documentary -- is brilliant.  I think some might under-estimate this film because it looks amateurish -- but that's why it works so well!  Afraid of the dark?  Half the film is black, threatening, night footage.

"Jaws made America fear the ocean... Blair Witch, the woods.","Every once in a while a movie will come along that will make America re-assess the way it looks at parts of life they encounter on an every day basis. For example, in the aftermath of such genius as the original ""Psycho"" (1960), America lay witness to an actual recorded drop in the amount of women who took showers instead of baths. After a movie like ""Jaws"" people were forced to think twice before entering the seemingly peaceful ocean. And now after viewing the shockingly original and very independent ""Blair Witch Project"" (it had a $75,000 budget)and after seeing its opening weekend figures I am positive that this movie will make the country if not the world afraid to enter the woods at night. The acting is so good that it borders on genuine and the idea is so original and successful because it shies away from the horror-genre cliches that would usually appear in a movie that takes place in a wooded setting. Not only is ""The Blair Witch Project"" one of the best summer movies ever, it is also scary enough to change the way horror movies are made in the future.

"Go for the experience, not the movie.","What makes this movie such a thrilling experience is the fact you never see the witch or mystical force in the forest playing tricks on these 3 students. You only see the tricks being played, and not consistently...but every now and then so it doesn't become repetitive but rather well timed and when you least expect or want it. The viewing through the camera gives it an unnerving realistic edge making you feel as if you are in the forest too or watching a real footage recorded by real people being tested, almost, by a real evil. All these factors collectively make the movie engaging, but not necessarily good. It is not the mark of a great movie at all, with the factors explain before acting almost comes at ease with almost able to play the part...the viewers aren't engaged with the actors necessarily but the whole array of noises, images and the general vibe the forest creates and vibe resulting from the relationship between the actors and the forest and 'witch'. This means sometimes the viewer will imagine noises which aren't even portrayed in the cinema. It is not really a movie in the sense of character and plot development, but rather an experiment to play on the audience. Perhaps that is why it is only just above an hour and nothing much really happens. The ending, itself, is also deliberately vague, giving open interpretation to the audience.

Dull incompetence wrapped up in false advertising,"It's either a documentary or a work of fiction.  If it's a documentary it's a fraudulent one.  (It's not even a clever fraud.  I wouldn't have thought that such grotesquely inept camera-jiggling could have fooled anyone; but apparently it did.)  If it's a documentary then it's none of MY business to condemn it - I should simply report the scam to the police, the broadcasting tribunal, etc. and hope that someone will have the nerve to prosecute.Taken as a work of fiction `The Blair Witch Project' is possibly the most wretched that has ever come to my attention.  I'm serious.  I can think of works of fiction that are worse in some positive way - books by Edgar Rice Burroughs, for instance - and I can't be expected to keep every single forgettable old book or television show lodged in my memory - still, I know of no other work so thoroughly lacklustre.  We don't even get the bare minimum of competent camera work we demand as a matter of course in other lame, incompetent endeavours.  The camera wobbles stupidly and does NOTHING else.  It doesn't even give us information.  The characters TELL us everything that's going on, in their long-winded way; they then offer us the camera footage as a kind of proof that they're not lying.  What's true of the images is true of the sound, too.  Heather and crew hear some `scary' noises at night; but do WE get a chance to listen to them properly, to decide for ourselves if they're scary or not?  Nope: instead we get an earfull of everyone panicking and DESCRIBING the sounds that I'm surprised they can still hear over the gabble of their own voices.How could something so bad as `The Blair Witch Project' turn a profit?  How could it show, not just a profit, but the greatest return on investment of any film in history; how could it, despite all the people who walked out of the cinema or wished that they had, produce a few testimonials from people who said that they were duly scared - even that they LIKED it?  I think I have an answer.  The film disguised itself as a documentary.  The dullest footage of the most banal murder has its attractions, provided it's genuine. Fictional murders have to work, so to speak, to be interesting: real murders automatically are.  A simple lie can transform eighty minutes of utter rubbish into box office gold.But you wouldn't want to tell an open lie too blatantly or too consistently. The law still has SOME teeth.  A better tactic is to persuade people to pretend - not imagine, but PRETEND - that they're watching a documentary. If we can't really believe that this is a documentary, they'd like us to come as close to really believing as possible.  Fiction is all about `suspending disbelief', right?Well, no, it isn't.  A good work of fiction can frighten us, thrill us, fill us with aching longing and/or keen interest, etc. without asking us to be so feeble-witted as to suspend disbelief.  `The Blair Witch Project' can't.P.S.:  Some say we should be merciful because the film only cost $30 000 to make.  But what does this have to do with us?  It's not as if they reduced admission prices in consequence.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""The Blair Witch Project""-  One of the most unnerving, exciting (and divisive) horror films of the past twenty years.","""In October of 1994 three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland, while shooting a documentary...A year later their footage was found.""...with those words, ""The Blair Witch Project""- one of the most successful independent films of all time, kicked off back in July of 1999. It was hailed by critics and became a worldwide phenomena, catapulting itself into legendary status in the world of horror almost instantly.It was not only one of the pioneering films in the current wave of the found-footage sub-genre (which had existed since at least 1980's ""Cannibal Holocaust"", but had never quite met with such public recognition), but also one of the earliest films to successfully implement a wildly successful web-based viral marketing campaign. It helped to sell the idea that this was more than a film- this was ""real."" People genuinely did not necessarily know that this was just a movie- the marketing made us question if this was real life footage, which only garnered more and more hype.It became something more than a film... it was an event. A piece of history.So, how does it hold up now, nearly 20 years later?I'd say extremely well.Yes, it is true that ""The Blair Witch Project"" had a somewhat divisive effect on audiences around the world. Horror has a way of dividing audiences in a way due to fear being a wholly subjective experience. But I do firmly believe that it is a masterpiece of horror, able to do so much with so little, while maintaining strong character, a compelling storyline and building a top-notch mythology that still has the power to stick with you long after the credits begin to roll.We follow a trio of student filmmakers- Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams and Joshua Leonard- as they travel to Burkittsville, Maryland to work on a documentary about the local legend of the ""Blair Witch."" However, their passion project soon gives way to absolute terror as they become lost in the woods, unable to find their way out, and mysterious events begin to plague them. It appears they are being followed by a mysterious force in the woods, which will stop at nothing to get them... And so, armed only with their wits and cameras to record the events plaguing them, they continue their journey, trying to escape the clutches of the evil that is pursuing them.The biggest appeal of the film is that it very much does prey on the idea that what you don't see is oftentimes scarier than what you do see. The film makes a constant and consistent effort to build an absolute atmosphere of dread using only minimal tactics. Strange sounds in the distance... pitch-black darkness surrounding our characters... the appearance of mysterious piles of rocks and figures made of sticks. It's incredibly minimalist, and yet it is so darned effective. And when the film finally does move in for those jumps to punctuate the atmosphere, you're so enthralled that it rattles you right to the core.The performances also help to elevate the material to its legendary heights. While it's key moments have been parodied to death in the ensuing years, it's hard not to connect with the characters. Particularly Heather, who despite her flaws, is still very much a person. When the film's iconic ""I'm so scared"" moments pops up (and that's not spoiling anything, it's one of the iconic images that the film was marketed by), your heart will be breaking while the hair on the back of your neck continues to stand with tension.It really is without question that writer/directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez struck gold with this film. It's become a pop- culture phenomena and to this day, is still aware and relevant to horror audiences.While it's slow-build nature may turn off some movie fans, I cannot emphasize how much this film works and how important it is when viewing the history of film and horror.It's easily a perfect 10 for me. Let's hope the upcoming 2016 follow-up is able to deliver even more of what made this film so magical!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"If you like horror films,  watch it","The Blair Witch Project, like The Ring, plays on the contemporary fear of technology, namely television. Through use of a clever advertising campaign, presenting it as a documentary, and much improvised acting, a sense of realism is captured and allows the viewer to consider how they would react in a similar position. The Blair Witch Project is very different to its horror film predecessors with its innovative hand held camera-work and 'fly on the wall' style and this works very well to allow the viewer a closer experience and more intimate relationship with the characters. Although being original and an interesting film, it does provoke many questions as to why the leading female Heather does not switch her camera off, however, as when watching most horror films, the viewer must let their cynicism go and in this case will be rewarded with a far from disappointing ending.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The best horror movie in the 90's...or is it ever?,"""The Blair Witch Project"" is a thruly amazing film, an effective machine of horror and despair, that, if you're willing to (because if you're not, it just doesn't work), it will disturb you. Great cast, specially the female lead (whose ""I'm so sorry"" sequence is unforgettable) and very expert and inteligent construction of fear. Final ten minutes are hell on earth, specially the ending bit where... Along with ""Texas Chain Shaw Massacre"" and ""John Carpenter's Halloween"", ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a must. Unfortunatly, it will be seen by too many people because of the publicity, and it will be stupidly hated, parodied, clones, imitated and...sequeled. No matter what people say to you, rent it or buy it (on DVD, because of the ""Curse of the Blair Witch"" documentary), see it alone, in the dark, in late night, and willing to enjoy it. It is worth it. If you've already seen it...just see it again!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Blair Witch is more boring than chilling,"I was disappointed in this movie after seeing it.  It is a very unique film, and its ability to actively involve the audience through ""real"" film footage is brilliant, but it lacks momentum and thrills.  The chilling aspect of the movie just isn't that strong.  The ending of the movie is very disturbing, but not all that shocking.  In fact, it is rather predictable.  The amateur nature of this film, while it does give the audience a strong sense of reality, is also the film's weakness because between the so-called frightening scenes is a large lull that consists of little more than constant arguing among the characters.  While the arguments are sometimes humorous, they also get tiresome very quickly.  This film is far above most horror films in terms of style, plot, and acting, but could and should have been more chilling than it was.  An audience's imagination can only go so far.  I would still recommend this movie, though, because it is a unique film experience.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Waste of film,"I'd select a negative number to rate this movie, if, I could !!! It wasn't frightening! It was a joke and should have been billed as a comedy. I had gone to the theater to see this movie, I recall leaving midway through the movie. I was bored to tears and stunned anybody would bother to waste their time even making a piece of trash like this. I only feel shame at being suckered into seeing this movie when it came out. A bunch of kids walking around in the woods, video taping each other, being scarred by a few noises. I guess their mommy wasn't there to tuck them in at night. The only redeeming thing I found to come out of this was a spoof done by the Cartoon Network. What I can't understand is how this movie didn't fall into the worst movie ever made category on IMDb.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Big impact, lesser essence","Rewatched it in 2022 without remembering much about the plot, and I have to say it has aged quite well. Creepy and scary, and of course it has to get extra points because it's one of the pioneer (and probably most memorable) films in the found-footage genre.All that said, if you take out its impact and significance on the horror scene at the time and just look at the film for what it is, I still consider it to be fairly overrated. If you take out a few suspense instances and the ending, it's mostly three people arguing about a map.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Biggest hoax in the history of cinema?,"I saw this movie 22 years after its release. For me, this looked like an amateur's attempt to do a movie. Although this is regarded as a horror movie, it did not give me any scares. Most of movie is made up of characters getting lost in a forest, arguing with each other and wandering helplessly. People have done excellent movies with a minimal budget. Only reason I can think of why this created a sensation back when it came out is the then novel concept of found footage.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Brilliant Movie,"The Blair Witch Project is a movie or should I say a documentary that really makes you think. Are the woods in Burkittsville, Maryland really haunted? Is there there such a thing as the Blair Witch? Three young adults that are interested in the blair witch rumors, pack some bags and some food and decide to camp in the woods to see if the rumor is really too. They hope to get a good documentary and maybe become famous someday. On the first day, everything goes find. On the second day, they get lost. On the third day, the voices begin. On the fourth day, the horror begins. On the fifth day, someday goes missing. On the sixth day, they all disappear, no one hears from them ever since but one year later their footage is found and people decide to make a movie out of it. I think the acting was superb, for a minute i thought that it wasn't acting, but the real footage. This is a wonderful and truly frightening movie. If your one of those people that like to see a lot of blood and enjoy watching people getting sliced into little pieces then this movie is definetaly not for you. I would give the Blair Witch Project 10/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good as a one off experience - but no need to repeat it,"""The Blair Witch Project"" seems to have got itself a love/hate relationship with many people. I'm a bit divided. The premise of the movie is simple enough: Three students go into the woods to make a documentary about the Blair Witch and end up wishing they hadn't.""The Blair Witch Project"" takes the approach that what's scariest is what our imaginations can conjure up (though this is of course a result of it's budget of about $20,000). We never see anything as such - a pile of stones doesn't exactly inspire fear but how they got there is (what's meant to) create the terror. The hounded feel is compounded by the use of the hand held camera to bring us into what Heather & co. are seeing - we never know any more than they do. We're with them until the end.Does any of it work? To an extent. As a one-off-no-lights-on experience it can be eerie for the reasons I've described. The use of unknown actors - who were themselves ""scared"" during filming to add authenticity - helps add to the ""reality"" of this being lost footage. On a second viewing the flaws become apparent - there's no plot for example. That's fine for a one-time viewing but a movie should stand up to repeated viewing. The direction is obviously not really there - they just fling the camera about as they're running around and the ""actors"" are not camera people.It's hard to judge ""The Blair Witch Project"". Certainly it's different. Different enough to be good is had to say. I'd recommend watching it to judge for yourself but I'd be surprised if many people get much out of watching it for a second time as it'd ruin the taste taken from the first. Overall I'd give it a 6.5/10 (rounded favorably to 7/10 on IMDB's voting poll because I'm a nice guy)",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The memory remains...,"...and finally, we get to see the blair witch in Italy! Thanks to the unrelenting hype the movie is doing GREAT at the box office, but almost everyone hates it. Why?

I liked the idea behind the project,but found it over-hyped. Then, a few hours later the full force of the film hit me like a bullet train.

slow and horrifying,"The Blair witch project is a horrifying movie. This is the first movie different from other horror Hollywood movies. I prefer to watch this movie because it is one of its kind. While i was watching this movie i felt like this is real. The forest with full of trees give a creepy look to this movie. Night clips of this movie are very horrifying, the strange voices from the woods were very horrifying and you will feel like you are there with them and facing all this. Horror from unknown is very terrifying and realistic kind off and not like other horror movies which has same line and same stories. I like the last scene of this movie which is shooted in a old creepy house.

The Blair Witch Project will have you become lost in your own boredom.,"The horror that popularised the ""found footage"" sub-genre (some would even say pioneer), gave way to future ultra low-budgeted features and proved that you don't need elaborate production values to make a film. You just need trees, rocks and a map. Now everybody go out and make a film! Unfortunately I'm not reviewing the excellently innovative marketing campaign that the film bolstered. I'm critiquing this snoozefest instead. A group of film students are filming a documentary about the ""Blair Witch"" legend and set off out into the woods to find evidence. Where they soon encounter frightening piles of rocks, spooky dangling sticks and a terrifying lack of basic orienteering skills. Oh yes, the scare factor is at an all-time high! Sit back, relax and prepare yourself to watch absolutely nothing. Nothing! Just three ridiculously unlikeable characters shouting and screaming at each other for 78 minutes whilst aimlessly wandering around a woodland area. ""Where's the map!?""! Someone give me a camera and find me some friends, I'll do the exact same thing and make a incalculable amount of money. On a serious note, I appreciate the stripped-back concept. It's not what you see that induces fear, but your other senses perceiving the unknown. A surround sound system works most efficiently as footsteps and faint screams are heard in every direction, creating an eerie environment. But when the poorly developed characters, story and pace are used to substitute onscreen scares, it doesn't work. You don't care. You just want the ""Blair Witch"" to savagely destroy them immediately. 78 minutes felt like 2 hours, honestly it is that poorly paced and boring. It's clear that The Blair Witch Project is divisive, and I suspect my opinion would be different if I watched it back in '99 with all the ""is it real?"" hype. Alas, it's aged badly. So much so that it just isn't scary, remotely interesting or captivating. Don't even get me started on that ending...",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Better than all those pseudo-teen slasher movies.,"There was alot of hype about this movie within the last few weeks, and it probably weakened the movies impact.Regardless, the filmmakers went back to what really frights you, rather than CGI style which tends to be the trend these days. Rather than showering a movie with played out graphical special effects or simple things jumping out and queued music to scare you, they go straight to what counts. The movie uses a more psychological way to frighten you, it puts you in the place of the charectors and lets you think for yourself. The movie does not spoil itself and take part in the trendy slashing-blood-everywhere films that are around today. Although lots of suburbanite kids will be saddened at the absence of massive gore and that it's not a large hollywood spectacle with a giant 20 track soundtrack, MTV special and some jennifer love hewitt charector. This movie sticks to the basics, while the ending might anger some, it sure leaves alot to wonder about in your head. I'm sure some people will walk away thinking of the ending, and what happened... Rather than eye-candy, this movie is true substance.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Horror of an Intrinsically Different Variety,"Three film students track the source of an urban legend, stomping through the Maryland woods with their gear to deliver stilted cemetery monologues and freak out when their sleeping bags are disturbed in the middle of the night. If you were around before the turn of the century, this one was tough to miss. A very early instance of viral internet promotion, it thrived on cultish word-of-mouth and a game cast of nobodies, capably playing their roles while also disappearing from the public eye to lend credence to rumors of their mutual demise. Even today, after the rise and fall of so many imitators, Blair Witch feels different. Not really a film in the traditional sense, it's more of an open-ended narrative experiment than a viewing experience, with a jostling handheld perspective that sets us down in the tent right beside those terrified twenty-somethings.Nearly all of Blair Witch's dialogue is improvised, which works as both a benefit and a drawback. We really believe in these people as functional individuals, not just characters, but we're also annoyed when they say or do something that gets in the way of the natural flow. Take the director/interviewer's nasty habit of interrupting or talking over her subjects, for instance. But there's no denying the value of their histrionic outbursts in the heat of the moment, nor their casual rapport early in the film. Their collective descent from playful camaraderie to frantic survivalism is vivid and powerful.The lore is pretty bare bones, just a few vague notes from ""man on the street"" interviews before the kids enter the forest, which adds to the sense of looming uncertainty. In the absence of hard facts, confusion feeds delusion. Although sequels would delve much deeper into the mythos, this initial chapter leaves everything open to interpretation. I prefer it that way; did this recovered footage actually capture something sinister, or was it just a case of three young adults, lost and exhausted, who panicked and thought they were seeing ghosts? The crew was clearly sleep and food deprived, and while their cameras don't lie, they also don't catch anything too inexplicable. We're more shaken by Heather, Mike and Josh's reactions because we can't see what's made them so upset. Given the budget, that was a great choice. A hidden menace (even an imaginary one) is always so much more effective, anyway.Essentially a filmed escape room / haunted house encounter, The Blair Witch Project remains compelling even without the twinge of uncertainty that first vaulted it to popularity. With a unique voice and an enduring, underrated set of performances, it's great proof that sometimes much less can be much more, both in terms of plot and budget. Even if the relentless shakycam did give me a headache.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"The most original, inventive, & gripping film in ages","Who ever thought you could make a movie like this and it would have turned out so well. I mean taking three unknown actors into the woods with shaky, handheld cameras and having them improvise most all the dialogue in a film that has an unseen villain and is almost completely absent of violence and gore. And somehow it is the scariest thing you will see for years to come.Stellar horror films are few and far between. The only great ones in the last ten years were ""Seven"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"". But now ""The Blair Witch Project"" should be added to the list of horror classics, somewhere near the top. It does for camping what ""Psycho"" did for showering and ""Jaws"" did for swimming in the ocean.As the three filmmakers get lost in the woods it becomes increasingly more evident with each passing night that someone or something is following them and has not taken a liking to their presence. The events that take place each night gradually become more and more drastic, making every evening more tense and frightening than the last. It continues to build until it reaches an ending of unbelievable intensity, and a final image that is as disturbing as it is perplexing.The best thing about this movie is that it's seen entirely through the eyes of the victims. That is what makes it so damn scary. The fact that unknown actors were used also definitely makes it so much more real. When they use improvisation for dialogue they seem like normal people, and you can feel the anger, paranoia, and fear as it radiates off of them. They're great.""The Blair Witch Project"" is a film that continues to haunt you long after the end credits have rolled. It stays with you.

There's nothing worse than shaky camcorder footage,"This ""movie"" is a ""documentary"" about the so-called Blair witch legend. It was marketed and hyped up as a true story, that three teenagers went into the woods in search of the Blair witch in October 1994 and never returned. Then their camcorder footage was found a year later.The whole idea behind this movie was to scare its audience with the concept of making the audience get frightened of things they don't see. It's called psychological horror. Other horror movies of the past have accomplished this goal. The Haunting (1963) is a perfect example. The Haunting was a professionally made movie with a musical score, the whole nine yards. In contrast, The Blair Witch Project was filmed with a camcorder and a shaky one at that. There is no music in the film. It's raw. It has a skeletal budget. It has the sounds of the day and the sounds of the night and the sounds of profane teenagers. It's basically a ""reality"" film about some teens who are lost in the woods in search of a legendary witch that supposedly lives there. The fact that they're looking for a witch and lost at the same time makes them increasingly frightened and frustrated as the movie progresses.The main problem I have with this film is that the footage is so shaky and amateur-ish. This movie is unwatchable. It'll make you dizzy and give you a headache. It's fine to use a camcorder. I thought it was a unique way to film a documentary ""movie"". But at least make the footage watchable. I can understand the camera shaking at times when the kids are running away from something that's scaring them, but to have shaky footage when they're just sitting around and talking or when planning their trip is really inexcusable. If I want to watch really bad and I mean REALLY bad and shaky camcorder footage, I can watch any one of the countless lame and shaky videos that people I know have made throughout the years. I don't know what's so hard about keeping a steady camera. This film would have been better if the camera-work was better. Instead of feeling scared, I found myself being distracted by the terrible camera-work and feeling dizzy with a headache, also. The bad camera-work robbed me of any scared feeling I was supposed to have when watching this film.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
