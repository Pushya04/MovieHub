"Disney, where have you been all this time?","Honestly, when is the last time you saw a decent Disney Animated feature? No no, PIXAR does not count. I'm talking about just a regular ol' straight laced Disney flick. If your like me, I'm sure your answer falls somewhere in the mid 90's. But isn't that a shame? What happened to the totally awesome Disney movies? If your excuse is because of technology, i assure you that your wrong. You can make a great animated movie without resorting to actual hand drawn art. But where is that old feeling we all use to share? Well i can tell you this much....i already knew that Disney had something special here, mainly because the VP of PIXAR jumped ship and decided to fund this project. The first time anyone from PIXAR has ever done so, let alone the freakin VP. So needless to say, Disney finally had enough, and pulled out all the stops for this one.I kid you not when i say this....""Tangled"" is easily the best Disney Animated feature i have seen since ""Aladdin"".....yes, it is that good. They finally let go of trying to find something new and different and settled with what was working for them almost 20 years ago. It's a princess tale that easily falls into the same category with the classics. So wait, does that mean i'm comparing it to the likes of ""Snow White"" ""Cinderella"" and ""Sleeping Beauty""? You damn right i am! Sure the storyline is cliché' and relative to other Disney classics, but it felt so good to see and feel something that helped recall your childhood. But other than those minor speed bumps, the movie is spot on. The animation is spectacular, and you would be a fool not to see it in 3D. The musical sequences didn't seem forced and were never boring. And i can almost guarantee you that it will snag the best song award at the Oscars. I'm just glad that they didn't work the story around the music, which is what a lot of animated features tend to slip up on. But this one did an amazing job of hybriding them together.Bottom Line, ladies and gentleman, this is the Disney picture you have been waiting for. It will definitely win your heart and please audiences both young and old.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Disney's back with their fairytale,"I was apprehensive, to say the least, when I went to see Tangled, after the disappointment that was Princess and the Frog. First, Disney's back with CGI animation, which hasn't really worked that great except, maybe to some extent, Bolt. Second, the trailers made it look really slapstick -- I'm rather wary of today's animation features that try too hard to be hip and fast-paced and silly.I was pleasantly surprised. Sure, there were slapstick and broad humor sure to make little kiddos laugh. But I was surprised by the sophistication as well. The screwball comedy between the hero and heroine is very well done; adults can appreciate that. The sidekicks, in particular the Max and Pascal, are hilarious. The hero and heroine are very likable and not flat. And there's a sense of sadness/wistfulness throughout the whole show that the adults will understand.But what really is great is the animation. This is Pixar-worthy great. In fact, after a while I forgot it was CGI (which tends to be a bit stiff and crude when it comes to character animation). The human characters have that hand-drawn quality even though they're CG. In fact, they're more expressive than the hand-drawn characters in Princess and the Frog. The backgrounds are gorgeous (I can count every blade of grass). And there's an iconic scene where the kingdom rouses from darkness to light with thousands of floating lanterns -- it really is magical. It reminds me of classics such as Beauty and the Beast and Sleeping Beauty.Best of all, the movie is not just all laughs and slapstick. It has heart too. Even the minor characters such as the King and Queen -- you can feel the emotions. And the romance is believable and not cheesy.Like I said, I was very pleasantly surprised. It's something that is worthy of Pixar, and I'm glad to see Disney back on their game. While Princess and the Frog was a missed opportunity, Tangled is almost perfect.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Definitely one of the best animated films I've seen...a guy's review,"Let me start by saying that I'm an 18 year old male, and was kinda dragged into watching this by my girlfriend, who is a big fan of the Disney princess movies. I finally gave in the other day, and I've very glad that I did.The movie looked gorgeous, the animation was spot on; all while holding on to the classic Disney feel.The main characters are extremely likable. Repunzel is your typical Disney princess style character: sweet, funny, etc. Eugene, aka Flynn Rider, kinda stole the show for me, but maybe that's because I'm slightly gender biased. Nonetheless, you can't deny his wit and humor. Maximus the horse fills the role of animal sidekick perfectly; just as good as Donkey was to Shrek even though he doesn't talk.While the plot is relatively predictable, it was still quite an enjoyable movie. I didn't find myself to be bored at only of the parts, and I was laughing a lot more than I had expected to. This movie is an instant classic, and a near perfect example of what animated fairy tales should be like if they want to appeal to a wide range of viewers, not just tween girls. The ending was sweet and should leave everybody happy.I think there's enough fun in this movie for all ages, including an 18 year old guy like me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Disney's best film in a long time!,"I am a huge Disney and animation fan, and was really interested in seeing Tangled. For me Disney have so many classics under their wing, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Bambi, Pinocchio, The Little Mermaid and Aladdin especially. For over a decade, the past Disney films ranged from very enjoyable(Emperor's New Groove) to truly disappointing(Chicken Little)- The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Tarzan were the last ones to truly blow me away- until now.While Tangled had me interested, I didn't like how the film was advertised. The trailer looked as though the film would be a Dreamworks knock-off, and I didn't think much of the title either. I needn't have worried, Tangled was wonderful and Disney's best film in a while(I know I said that about last year's Princess and the Frog, yes I actually liked that too, but after seeing Tangled I've changed my mind). The film is so much better than its advertising suggested, it is not a knock-off of Dreamworks and more importantly it not only has the Disney magic but it has something for both kids and adults.What wowed me immediately about Tangled was the animation. It is simply gorgeous. The colours look beautiful, the backgrounds are stunning especially that surrounding Rapunzel's tower and the characters are very well modelled. The real revelations are with Rapunzel's hair, which is a masterstroke and also the floating lanterns, a scene of true beauty and very touching. Alan Menken's music was a surprise and in a good way. For me, this was his best score since The Hunchback of Notre Dame(that score is amazing), I was especially taken with the Kingdom Dance.The songs are also not bad at all, they are not quite instant classics like Colours of the Wind, Beauty and the Beast, When You Wish Upon a Star, Heigh Ho, Part of Your World, Circle of Life, Hellfire, Under the Sea, Whole New World and Bells of Notre Dame are, but they are listenable with beautiful melodies and surprisingly decent lyrics. The best for me were the stunning I See the Light and the goosebump-inducing Mother Knows Best.The writing is another strong asset. Tangled has some truly excellent writing, particularly with Flynn and Rapunzel, it is funny, witty and even touching. The storytelling is polished and is snappily paced, with the action sequences lively and the ending fitting well with the rest of the movie. When I saw the trailer I was expecting a story scattered with pop-culture references and almost laughter-free dialogue, but actually the storytelling does have a classic feel to it and some scenes like the aforementioned floating lanterns give the film its magic.I also loved Tangled's characters. Rapunzel is one sassy heroine and is also someone young girls in particular can relate to. Flynn is a charming, dashing and charismatic hero too, and his interaction with Rapunzel alone gives Tangled its spark. Mother Gothel is another strong character, in her character you can see shades of both Lady Tremaine and Frollo, and on top of that she is a very intriguing villainess. Even more surprising were the comic relief characters. There have been animated films/Disney films where the comedy either works like a glove(Emperor's New Groove), is either hit or miss(I say this with a heavy heart, Hunchback of Notre Dame) or doesn't work at all(Chicken Little). Here the comedy works perfectly, hilarious without being too over-the-top. Pascal is both hilarious and cute and Maximus the horse is a sheer delight in everything he does.The voice acting also adds a lot to the film. Mandy Moore is a perfect choice for Rapunzel, she has a pleasant speaking voice and a beautiful singing voice. I loved the charisma Zachary Levi brings to Flynn, his voice is one of the main reasons why Flynn is as likable as he is, while Donna Murphy is perfect as Mother Gothel.In conclusion, this was a wonderful film and I recommend it heartily for both kids and adults. For Disney fans too, I think you will be delighted, if you want humour, adventure, beautiful animation, good music, classic storytelling, witty scripting and likable characters, Tangled is a perfect match. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Excellent family entertainment.,"A few days ago I saw ""Megamind"", and thought it was just okay. I enjoyed it for what it was, but I didn't think it too spectacular. My faith in CGI entertainment was on the wane.Well, tonight Disney pulled me from that depression, and help reinvigorate my belief in, well, just plain Disney.What we have here is Rapuntzel turned on her head, with a dash of ""Snow White"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"" stirred in to keep our interest.The film was charming, clever and witty without being too much of either. The comic timing was toned down for the young kiddies in the audience, mostly little girls and some younger boys, but the comedic aspect itself did not lose luster for this. If anything it showed just what good clever comedy was. Note Rapuntzel's improvised weapon, and how she brings it to bear on the baddies in the local tavern. Classic character sketch comedy, and I don't care if I was the only one who noticed it and was laughing. You're supposed to laugh!The story itself regards fleeing the nest from a ""Mime"" like character, whose interest in our heroine is less than altruistic. The dashing rogue comes in to ground the story and keep Mandy Moore's character from running amuck and falling into despair.All in all, even though a middle aged dude like myself is no where near the target audience, I enjoyed it immensely.Some criticisms; the villainess seemed marginally cliché. She had the liberated 70s woman gone bad thing going on for her, but it almost seems like we may have seen this character before. Not sure, really. The horse was extremely likable, but his rider could have played more of a role. In fact the supporting cast almost seemed as if they were denied screen time so we could revel in Rapuntzel's golden locks. For all that, and even though the action did dive into classic Warner Brother's cartoon territory, ""Tangled"" does make a very respectable showing.That, and it was good to hear the voice of Richard Kiel play a big galoot who turns out to be a good guy. :)My final note is that there was a very good message for young girls at the end, and in fact anyone with some sense will have caught on to it. It's a message that won't last too long, but hopefully will serve as a reminder to those who paid attention. Remember, hair isn't everything. Regardless of color *wink*Take the family, but, if you're the father, then please, PLEASE, do not spend countless minutes like the idiot in front of me paying for his four member family with several credit cards while the ticket taker next to him managed to whiz through four or five parties of several members each for the 7:20 showing at the Redwood City theatre on Theatre Row.Yeah, if you're reading this, you know who you are. Stop being a putz!Everyone else, go see and enjoy the film :)",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Excellent!!,"After seeing the previews I thought it'd be a light hearted and fun movie to watch but it just exceeded my expectations.The humor is only slightly outranked by the facial expressions, particularly those of Rider.Maximum was hilarious.A horse with a mind of his own that can do quite a number of 'stunts'.I would highly recommend this movie not only to adults but for young children as well. It's fast, exiting and very entertaining.I didn't find any parts to be 'slow going' and it certainly put a new slant on the old story of Rapunzel.A real 'feel good happy' type of movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Incredibly fun movie,"I will start by saying that I am a 62 year old grandfather of three (9, 8, and 5) who has no connection to Disney in any way. I took the grandkids today to see this movie and they loved it, as did I. The 3D is worth going to. There is enough silliness, adventure, and romance to allow boys and girls of almost all ages to love this show. There were some funny lines in the show that kids would not understand, but adults would enjoy. I heard a gentleman laughing throughout the whole show. I am not around teenagers, so I am not sure how a teenager would respond to this show. The storyline was different but predictable. That should not discourage anyone from going to this show. I would rate it as one of the best, if not the best animation show I have ever seen. This show is a winner as a family show.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Vintage Disney.,"I was quite skeptical of this because I thought the Golden Year of CG- Animated films ended with a not-so-big-bang with the decent ""Megamind"". After a year which brought you ""How To Train Your Dragon"", ""Toy Story 3"", ""Despicable Me"", and ""Legend Of The Guardians: The Owls Of Ga'Hoole"", can there really be any other CG-Animated films of that caliber?""Tangled"" miraculously continues and ends that streak (at least for this year alone) with a big bang.There is nothing wrong with liking a movie which is out of your personal tastes. Yes, ""Tangled"" may look like a typical kids film on the poster, but I am glad to say that this film is a strong return to form for Disney Animation Studios.Even if it is CGI and even though the film bases itself around another fairy-tale princess, it is done very well. It is made clear that everyone involved in the film cared about the material and wanted it to reach out to everyone. They succeeded brilliantly. Everything that you loved in an animated Disney film is here in full force. Disney has never been this good since the 90's. Pixar is excluded - they're in a world of their own.Take for example, the characters and actors. Rapunzel looks cute and adorable, Flynn looks handsome and dashing; and the villains look menacing. Yet, underneath it all, the voice actors bring out the dimensions in the characters. A very versatile Mandy Moore makes Rapunzel a sweet and innocent girl yet one who is full of adventure and determination. Flynn, voiced by ""Chuck""'s own Zachary Levi, shows dry wit and vanity at times, and also self-actualization later on in the film. The other voice actors do their part just fine, especially Donna Murphy as Mother Gothel - a selfish and cruel new addition to the Disney villain club.While the story/screenplay was written well for what it's worth, the music by Alan Menken truly displays his signature Disney trademarks, the grand music, the catchy songs, the emotional ballads in the middle. I'm not surprised if it gets an Oscar nomination at the very least, knowing Oscar.Well, there, I've said it. I really enjoyed ""Tangled"", its extremely like-able main characters and it's fantastic visuals enveloping a classic fairy tale, it is a real welcome return to form for Disney, and I really hope it continues to go down this way. This one is a definite must watch for the families, a new ""Princess"" classic for Disney.Overall rating: 75/100",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Very good movie in every aspect,"This movie hits the mark on all levels. It is beautifully illustrated and the story is simple, yet works and keeps your interest. I'm not a big song guy..... but the songs in this movie are very good. Either very funny or, when the love songs begin, nicely done with some good lyrics and music. It's a '10' all the way across the board. In keeping with the Disney animators reputation for hiding phallic symbols, this has maybe the most blatant one of all. When the mother is standing near the window, her shadow is unmistakably harder than Chinese arithmetic. Keep an eye out for it..... But, this movie really is well done. The song and visuals in the tavern with all the thug characters is pretty funny. Definitely see this one!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A Must Watch for Kids!,"'Tangled' is A Must Watch for Kids. The fairytale, the astounding animation, the wonderful 3D effects... it's an ideal baby film. As an adult, I too enjoyed the film, though, not totally.After watching masterstrokes like 'Up' and 'Toy Story 3' recently, I've raised my expectations way too much from an animation flick. As I had heard the legend of Rapunzel as a kid, 'Tangled' didn't offer much novelty to me. But despite the popular story it adapts, the film holds you, especially in the first hour, which is superb. The only shortcoming in this love-story, is the overdose of Songs. They keep popping up, and one truly wishes if they weren't hammered so many times.Looking from the point of view kids mainly, I suggest you do make your kids watch 'Tangled', as it will be a dazzling & memorable experience for them. And I'd say for those, who still are a kid at heart, do watch it... the spell-binding animation & 3D effects are sure to keep you energized.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Don't bother - Disney at it's usual worse,"This movie is a great disappointment, you cannot even begin to compare it with other masterpieces from DreamWorks or Pixar (which is now owned by Disney).1) What's with all the singing. Disney seems to have repeat melodies for the songs across their cartoons. (Deja vu in Princess and the Frog).2) Typical storyline. The trailer was actually misleading - I believed it to have more of a plot.To it's credit:1) Rapunzel's hair is magnificent. Great hair animation.2) Kids would probably love the cartoon. And that's it. It's a cartoon only for kids. Adults, be warned.",2.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A New Classic.,"I was very sketchy walking into this movie. I didn't know what to expect, it's Disney which is promising, but it's also Disney's first CGI Disney movie that got a PG rating, so it seemed different. It was pretty hard for me to choose between 'Tangled' or 'Burlesque' but I'm glad I made the decision to watch 'Tangled'.This film has everything, for everyone, boys girls and tongue in cheek humor for adults. It's Disney's answer to Shrek, but in a classy way, that doesn't feed off of pop culture.The story of the film is simple. Rapunzel is a princess that has hair that has power to heal and keep people young, but once it's cut, it loses all power. When Rapunzel was just an infant she was kidnapped by an old woman who locked her away in a tower to keep her hair all to herself. Rapunzel grows up thinking that her kidnapper is in fact her mother, and the reason she's locked away is because her 'mother' wants to keep her safe from the hardships of the world. I'd tell you more about the movie but I don't want to ruin it. Let's just say she runs away. Very simple, fairy tale plot.I was kind of saddened that Disney has succumbed to making Princess movies using CGI, but watching this movie I realize that some scenes wouldn't have the power it had, if it were in 2D. The lantern lighting scene, for example, was amazing. It wouldn't have been the same in 2D. The music, was perfect. Enough musical number to keep Disney fans more than satisfied and not enough to where it's overkill. The songs were heartfelt and meaningful, they all served a purpose, it wasn't just a nameless song thrown into the movie. The voice acting, by Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi were amazing. I was a little sketchy about Mandy. I'm a long time fan, but I wasn't sure if she had the right voice to be a Disney Princess. She gave Rapunzel so much life, and innocence, I couldn't think of any other actress who could play her better. Zachary gave Flynn life, and humor, and made him a very likable character. However, the two characters that stole the show were Pascal, the chameleon, and Maximus, the horse. Although these supporting characters have no speaking lines, through actions and emotions, you know exactly what they want to say, and the message comes in loud and clear.This movie has enough action and comedy to keep boys happy and enough emotion, romance and drama to keep the girls happy. There are a few scenes that made me tear a little, well maybe more than a little. Some scenes have so much emotion and depth that it tugs at your heartstrings, and gives you goosebumps, especially the lantern scenes. Disney is testing the waters of their film making with this one. There were many alcohol references and even references about being drunk. There's violence, people getting stabbed, and yes, even blood. Which you never see is Disney movies.Overall, I highly recommend this movie, to everyone. Anyone could enjoy this movie. It's very hard not to like it. With theater prices so high, I suggest you don't spend 10 dollars to watch Cher and Christina, but watch 'Tangled' instead. They don't make movies like this anymore. It's much better than last year's 'Princess and the Frog'. Rapunzel is now in the line-up of classic Disney princess. I cannot stress how amazing this film is. Go out and see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
My Favorite Disney Movie,"I saw the finished movie at the screening before the wrap party. The movie works on every level. The Characters, the animation, the story, the score, the romance, and it's all very cute as well (in a way Disney can apparently still pull off).The one thing that I didn't get into was the songs (Except maybe the ""Mother Knows Best"" reprise). They were a little weak melodically and you won't be singing them for weeks like I do ""Part of Your World"" every time I watch the ""Little Mermaid."" However, the songs are good enough not to bring the movie down. There are so many touching scenes in this movie and you will love all of the characters by the end and have an amazing time in the process.It is definitely worth seeing in the theater, as this is probably the prettiest computer animated movie I've seen. I just can't wait to see it in stereo!(BTW, I'm a 30 year old male who grew up with Disney. And I feel like I'm being objective when I say this movie works as a movie and not as a movie exclusively for 10 year old girls.)",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"Doubt if you must, but Tangled will win you over.","Although Disney will forever be immortal for their varied peaks of films since 1937, they have been struggling to stand out lately. The word Disney has become synonymous with animation and its easy for Pixar, Fox and Dreamworks to all come under the same label for kids, rather than show themselves as competitors. They thrive on franchises whereas Disney tries to keep its sequels to its straight-to-bargain bin department. These franchise films become events and although I would call Wreck-It Ralph an event movie, the average joe has no idea who made it anyway. So in retrospect, I do feel bad for overlooking Tangled as it belongs in a difficult and murky time for unique animated films, especially as it's CGI as opposed to Disney's previous landmark The Princess and the Frog. But surprisingly, it's a super charming film and it has an broadness that truly does appeal to everyone. I think it's in the sense of humour, it's very quirky and dry, reminding me of the laid-back attitude The Emperor's New Groove and Shrek. There's brilliant running gags and details sprinkled around that land immediately and make it a more involving experience.The quality in the animation was definitely worth the ballooned budget and more as they can compete with Pixar at this point. However, the storytelling is typical and overfamiliar at this point. Sure, it's Disney's style, but it's nowhere near as refreshing as Wreck-It Ralph for instance. Its biggest mistake was the songs. It could've been okay if they were unique, but they seemed like they were tagged on out of necessity. Too often do they drag the film into melodrama when it actually hits some poignant notes from time to time, but its biggest sin is that they're too plain. I also found myself wanting to know a lot more about the antagonist. She was hundreds of years old and her motivation seemed to only strike in the last twenty. There's something Walt Disney used to say which I wish the makers of Tangled took on board which is a film is only as strong as its antagonist. Sometimes it seems like the good guys will never make it as she's hot on their tails, but then it never follows through until it's hit the point it wants to show. But it's fine, the enjoyable side characters more than make up for her and in the end, Tangled wins you over. Definitely a great attempt at Disney modernising without selling their spirit.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
My 354th Review: Excellent entertainment - really,"With jaw-dropping graphics and an abundance of heart this is simply what you would wish for in a fairy tale: memorable, magical, and magnificent.We cannot remember the last time we saw a film that was simply so entertaining - there is almost nothing to complain about here in any way and much to praise from values to comedy to several scenes that were genuinely moving - this really is one of the best movies of the year and deserves its massive box office success.If perhaps you are reluctant to see it as you think it will just rehash old Disney ideas or be unsuitable for small children I would say those are always my first concerns, but here for the first time in a very long time I can honestly say that here we have a film that holds its own integrity and so, even with the villain's death, you don't feel that it was put in to scare.All in all, a magical, hilarious, witty, and very well thought through movie that deserves the Oscar that is surely coming to it - simply the best animated movie of the year as, more even than Toy Story 3, it rises beyond animation to make a wonderful heart-filled adventure that makes for very satisfying viewing indeed.Thank you, Disney.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Very Pretty, Sweet, Funny, But Not Quite a Classic","""Tangled"" is a very, very pretty movie. The lantern scene, Rapunzel's tower, the castle interior – all very nice to look at. The heroine is genuinely adorable, and the hero is really handsome. The script is sweet and funny. The songs fit their scenes. Rapunzel's animal companion, a chameleon, was adorable and different – it did not talk, except through very articulate facial expressions. The chameleon did not have supernatural knowledge; it learned along with Rapunzel.I enjoyed ""Tangled"" a lot, but the storyline didn't have the focus or power that would have made it a classic for me. I wasn't scared by Mother Gothel. The extreme exaggeration of the animation distanced me. Did Rapunzel's and Mother Gothel's eyes need to be THAT big? And what country in Europe, which is where this story originated, have such wildly exaggerated topography? Overall, though, this film is better than most. It's just that I did like it so much I wanted it to be a classic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Awe-Inspiring!,"Not often does a movie bring tears in my eye, and this one truly turned on the waterworks. Maybe because I am going through my own hard times, or because I had just read a throughly heartbreaking the night before, but regardless, Tangled currently stands as one of the greatest animated films I have ever seen.To put it in a few words, Tangled had everything, and much more. The only way to truly experience this spectacular viewing is to see it for yourself! It spoke volumes to me, and on so many different levels!As a 19 year old male, the typical blood and guts, Saving Private Ryan movie goer, I went into the theater expecting to be bored out of my mind. Truth me told, I was not ecstatic during some of the singing scenes, but I was throughly amazed by almost every other scene in this film. It reminds me greatly of Enchanted, or even The Princess Bride. Romantic love stories, with quite a struggle, and great humor!I would recommend this movie to everyone, young and old!

Goldilocks And Her Free Hairs,"An apt film, as it turned out, to watch in lockdown, this free adaptation of the old fairy tale for me is the way Disney should be going, finding fresh tales to tell from the great collections rather than remaking their classic animations of the past as real-life features.A winning combination of humour, music and animation, I rate this one of the best Pixar movies I've seen. Personally I do find the depiction of the characters slightly problematic, especially females with their massive eyes and eyelashes just making them, particularly the heroines, too cutesy. Perhaps the same could be said of the heavies whose ugly features are a bit too exaggerated too but I did like the way roguish Flynn / Eugene was shown. As for the backgrounds and individual details, these are pretty wonderful, like the depictions of grass, flowing water and of course Rapunzel's hair. Better yet is the imaginative staging of shots, some taking viewpoints we would now recognise as drone shots while others just demonstrate motion and speed in pleasing and often exhilarating ways, the best of them probably being the flying lanterns, which look like magical dolly mixtures in motion, which, trust me, is a very good thing. I enjoyed the vocal acting, the better for not being done by some megastar who doesn't need the work.The story follows the classic template for this type of film, a young heroine (or hero), striking out for personal freedom, often to right a great wrong, usually against the advice of those around them. Usually too there is at least one and here in fact two cute animal companions, some romantic interest, a lot of feel-good songs, usually by Alan Menken and of course an evil baddie to pursue and thwart the central character until all is resolved for the inevitable happy ending.Of course I appreciate that a film like this isn't aimed at the likes of me but I still enjoyed many of the gags, the songs, even if it perhaps lacks a really big number that sticks in the memory and the rollicking story. Sure some of the individual characterisations aren't too different from what we've seen before but this is definitely higher-grade Disney and a good fun movie to watch at a time like this.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Funnier Than Expected!,"Tangled is a pretty entertaining and funny movie. It surprised me how funny it was when I watched it for the first time. The story is pretty interesting and engaging too. The animation is nice, and there are some unique qualities to the animation. The movie does some cool things with Rapunzel's hair for example. Apparently, this is estimated to be one of the most expensive animated movies ever made! I'm guessing her hair was part of the reason. Overall, Tangled is an entertaining movie with a nice story, interesting animation, and some great laughs. I personally prefer it over the movie Frozen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Disney returns to form,"I was very pleased with last year's The Princess and the Frog, and this year Disney has again impressed me. Tangled brings back the likes of Glen Keane and Alan Menken in a visually delightful and fun reprise of the sort of films Disney produced twenty years ago, although the dialogue and pacing is noticeably modernized; such is either good or bad, depending on, among other factors, your age. Alan's creative touch in the film's songs is immediately recognizable to older Disney fans, as is, regrettably, the inevitable use of Autotune (although Mandy Moore is a perfect choice for a Disney heroine, as she both acts and sings exquisitely). The two leads speak much as two teenagers today would, although some of Flynn's lines are too corny to tolerate.No review of this film would be complete without praise for the stunning backgrounds and perfectly calibrated lighting, as well as Rapunzel's incredibly rendered hair; I, not normally a fan of computer animation, was visually satiated throughout the entire picture. The visual style of Tangled was clearly less photorealistic than simply photogenic, which is a sight for sore eyes after an industry-wide bombardment of gaudy effects for the better part of a decade.In summary, long-time followers of Disney would do well to see Tangled, as would children who have yet to be introduced to the studio's work.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A True Return to Disney Classics,"Tangled continues in Disney's animation legacy of timeless classics. Being Disney's first fairy tale outing done in CGI, it's easy to have doubts. The marketing for this film didn't really do Tangled any favors either. Originally titled Rapunzel, the name change to Tangled and the shift of focus onto the male co-star Flynn Ryder in the merchandising was done as a way to try to get more boys into the theater. Despite this faulty marketing move, Tangled is very much Rapunzel's story and Rapunzel is the star of this instant classic. Sticking very close to the roots of the original German Rapunzel fairy tale, Tangled's story is one about overprotective parental figures and the need to want to break free. Mandy Moore voices Rapunzel and sings for her. Yup, this a musical. This is a big grand musical in the classical Disney style with songs by Alan Menken and Glenn Slater. Alan Menken was the one who brought Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast and Enchanted to life; to name only a few. Moore really gets to the heart of Rapunzel and truly owns the part, but the real surprise is Donna Murphy as our main villain Mother Gothel. A true hero is measured by it's main villain and Mother Gothel does not disappoint.Every great Disney classics needs supporting characters. What would Mary Poppins be with Bert and the Banks' Children. What would Belle be without the enchanted objects. Snow White is just a lost girl in the forest without those dwarfs.An amazing supporting cast of characters that include Rapunzel's color changing chameleon companion Pascal, the scene stealing horse Maximus, and the main male co-star Flynn Ride accompany Rapunzel in her quest. Pascal and Maximus are animal companions but have more in common with Meeko and Percy from Pocohantas than Sebastian and Flounder from Little Mermaid for the fact that they don't talk. While they are without speech, they are fully fleshed out characters and you know exactly what they are trying to convey with their sometimes hilarious reactions. Maximus was especially a personal favorite of mine. Zachary Levi from the TV show Chuck voices and sings for Flynn Rider and it's easy to see why Disney would choose to up sale him in the TV ads. I would have to say that he's one of the most fleshed out Disney heroes since Aladdin.Tangled is a big grand epic Disney musical done in the classic sense with the modern rendering of CGI animation. This is for sure to be seen for years and years to come and I can't wait to include Tangled in my Disney Collection. I highly recommend this one.http://neonboy619.blogspot.com",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Disney Re-imagines another beautiful classic,"A thought I've had a lot lately is ""A lot of key Disney films have roots in tales and folklore"" and although it's true, they manage to create and re-imagine these ol stories into something creatively vibrant and fun, and Tangled is no exception.

great movie for entire family - a MUST SEE!!,"We took our two kids (4 and 6)to see a preview of this days before the official release. In short, it was one of the best Disney films yet. Everyone simply loved it. The 3-D effects were noticeable and wonderful. We got a kick watching our 4-year-old raise his hands as if to catch some of the action float off the screen. There were tears, and much laughter, as is Disney's style. The story of Rapunzel is very well told here, with great villains, heroes and wonderfully entertaining scene-stealers, like the non-verbal horse, Maximus. The music is very theatrical and very typical of the usual Alan Menken genius (Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Little Mermaid, etc.). This movie is very entertaining for adults, and the kids will absolutely go crazy for it! Treat your family this season to a great movie!

Disney's Mangled,"This is what you get for not seeing ""The Princess and the Frog."" Disney eschewed its revitalization of traditional animation for this forgettable CG adaptation of Rapunzel, which goes by the nondescript nom de plume: ""Tangled.""If the recent announcement that the animation giant is placing a moratorium on fairy tale films should come as a surprise to anyone, their position on the matter is telegraphed plainly into the first five minutes of their latest and last: modern audiences won't sit for straight- faced fantasy. The name-change alone underscores the corporation's feelings on the commercial viability of a tradition it once held proud.That willful dissolution of magic is a slap in the face to ""Snow White"" or ""Sleeping Beauty."" ""Tangled"" begins with striking imagery, but buries it beneath a sour, smarmy voice over by this year's prince-not-so-charming, Flynn Ryder (Zachary Levi). As narrator, he cracks jokes at the expense of the archetypical framework—as if he doesn't, and we shouldn't, treat the story with one modicum of seriousness. Being cavalier about your own film isn't a great way to hook your viewers.Thus ""Tangled"" is a disengaging experience from the outset. It downplays its fairy tale roots, but then never defies them. It disinterests us in its world, and then asks us to spend ninety minutes there. Worse, it suffers from sloppy characterization, including one of the single weakest antagonists in Disney history. Donna Murphy plays Mother Gothel to Mandy Moore's Rapunzel, and neither has a lick of personality. The irksome Flynn is practically the only other human character, with the rest of the world being populated by nameless thugs and townspeople. When so much relies on so few, you'd think more attention would be paid to making them distinct.Essentially, Repunzel's sole remarkable trait is her magic hair, a plot device that is curiously ignored throughout the film. There are plenty of early gags visualizing how she manipulates it (for instance, in order to lift her mother into the tower), but it's clearly an afterthought as her adventure is set into motion. To illustrate, the princess emerges from a stream without any indication of the added water weight. She never once has her locks stepped on, snagged, or caught in a door. I thought this movie was called ""Tangled!"" Having hair that long would be a major inconvenience, people!Maybe I'm splitting hairs (ouch); I probably shouldn't have expected anything more from ""Tangled""—it's the near unanimous praise I don't understand. The songs are lousy, the characters are dull (save for one spunky chameleon), and the story merely suffices (but then it's tough to break something that's survived hundreds of years). The film is so clearly catered to a younger crowd that my curmudgeonly opinion is somewhat irrelevant, but with Pixar managing year after year to satisfy the storytelling needs of both adults and children, Disney's ""Tangled"" is an immediate relic. It's a film made for twelve year olds who need to be convinced that fairy tales aren't stupid and boring.""Enchanted"" and ""The Princess and the Frog"" were classic Disney films despite their flaws. Their creators clearly understood what made the studio in its prime so successful. ""Tangled"" is a harmless children's cartoon, but it doesn't recapture any of the magic the company is known for. Instead, it takes a snide approach to the Rapunzel story while simultaneously contributing nothing to it. I may not be the target audience, but to quote an old friend, ""If this is where the monarchy is headed, count me out.""",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
An overnight Disney Classic,"While updating our own profile on Facebook we came across a great link posted by Apollo Cinema Burnley for some free preview tickets for the new film Tangled 3D a film based on the story of Rapunzel which has been sprinkled with a little Disney Magic.Having a six year old as an excuse to see all the Disney films is great , but recently seeing Toy Story 3 3D and Shrek Happily ever after in 3D I left feeling that the movie makers still had some way to go with a 3d film .Viewing some trailers for tangled it looked like it was going to be a funny film but was the trailers packet with the best bits? With a big smile on my face I can honestly say read on :)When the screening started 3D glasses at the ready for us all, the Sony dog I think is great and hoped that Tangled would be more like this where you could reach out and grab things, fingers crossedFrom the start I was hooked and from the absolute silence in the cinema it seemed everyone else was too. For the next hour and a half I was taken on a none stop roller coaster that just kept getting better. The 3D was amazing and at one point my son really did reach out to grab something out of the film .The story is fantastic with every character capturing your imagination and throwing you into the film wondering what's coming next . A Disney film wouldn't be a Disney film without a bit of singing and dancing and this film has just the right amount , this coupled with the already great story leaves me to think it will become one of the Disney classics it really was brilliant.I would recommend going seeing this, it put a smile on my face and my son loved it, its one of the best films I've seen for ages that we could all sit and watch together.Review by The Local Explorer",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Predictable in every way but still magical adventure,"Now this is a very generic and predictable adventure and if you seen enough Disney movies, it's obvious the stuff in this have way too many Disney cliché going on. But the thing is, it's still a magical adventure and is still worth seeing it in 3D despite the narrow and predictable story. At first I was just going to pass on this movie, but the 260 million dollar production value got me interested. And let me tell you, this movie is just gorgeous to look at with some amazing and fluid animation. And despite the Disney cliché, it has elements that kids will most definitely enjoy and most adults will have a good time as well. All the audience in the theater seemed to have a good time watching this, so if you want to watch a movie you and your kids will enjoy I highly recommend checking this out.7.9/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Two words: Simply Amazing,"First let me say that I am not usually the one who give reviews to movies, but this one I felt was necessary. When I went to see Disney's Tangled, I really wasn't expecting much. The previews I saw hadn't appealed to me enough, but a group of friends went to see it and I was dragged there. To put it in simple terms, it was amazing! Not only were the characters believable, but the relationships between them were as well, especially between the hero, heroine and villain. The design was very detailed and beautiful; I personally loved the scene with the lights -if you've seen it, you know what I mean. As for the score, I feel it went back to the classics like ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Beauty and the Beast""; the songs were very much like the movies when I was growing up, when Disney was the number one choice for kids. Although in my opinion, Tangled didn't manage to bring a song as memorable as key songs like ""Part of your world"" or ""Beauty and the Beast"", I can't take the ""Healing Song"" out of my mind.All in all, I believe it was a wonderful movie. It felt like Disney from the good old days. I guess it's a farewell note to all of us who grew up with Disney as they head out of the 'Princess era' and bring forth their new 'boy-oriented' movies. In all true honesty, even though I'm a 25 year old male, I am one who loves the classics, and don't find any interest in movies like the ""Mars needs Moms"" that was announced before the movie started. It's movies like these that made Disney so popular, and even though I understand why they decided to make this change, I feel that what Disney should focus on is bringing more movies like Tangled: with enough story, great characters, a pinch of heart and a general feeling of hope that makes Disney what it has always been: a place for kids to hope and dream.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
3D Golden Animated Beauty,"""Tangled"" is the newest film in the animated world of Disney released just in time for the Holiday movie rush. The film combines the old school classic Disney feel with animation of the modern times. The magic of song and dance flows as glamorously as Repunzel's hair itself through this new tale. After making fifty films, Disney has finally made one about the story of Repunzel explaining giving meaning to the lines, ""Repunzel, Repunzel let down your hair."" The story of Repunzel is available in both 3d and 2d and instead of the 2d Animation Disney tried to bring back last year with ""The Princess and the Frog,"" modern animation and is used. The film begins with the sarcastic narration of Zacharey Levi's (""Chuck"") character Flynn Rider as he explains the legend of Repunzel's (Mandy Moore) hair consisting of a special flower used to save her mother's life. The story then follows Repunzel as she seeks out the answers to questions about her child hood and who the Mother Gothal (Donna Murphy) that is keeping her up in a secluded tower really is. She asks herself what the lights are that appear in the sky on each of her birthdays? Flynn Rider is an outlaw who is more connected to Repunzel than she knows with his latest heist. The story changes both of the characters as they grow towards happily ever after.The film is a visual masterpiece showing the 3d golden beauty of the animation. Repunzel's sunlit hair flourishes across the screen as the love affair between Mandy Moore's and Zacherey Levi's characters grow through the personalities of the actors portraying them. Disney finds the perfect balance between dance and song for Repunzel, Flynn and company to express very important moments in the film. The songs are crafted as dialogue more than just catchy tunes meant to please the audience and they aren't done in a gaudy fashion like previous Disney films. The film is also a little darker than usual, ending in a more logical sense. Don't worry though, the film does not lose its magic. Comedy is present in order to keep the film fresh and happy as Repunzel's kidnapper Mother Gothel exemplifies her ridiculous relationship with Repunzel. Disney recognizes that its films tend to be very predictable and mocks itself with the dialogue of Flynn throughout. This allows the film to be more believable and captures laughs from the audience as well.There isn't much in the film for adults other than the animation splendor and a little entertainment, while the almost too Disney film will be immensely enjoyed by younger little kids.. On the other hand the film does have a scary moment as well? The entire film caters entirely to kids until one frightening moment that may cause a squirm or two. The film will not seem very different story-wise to many of the classics that the older audience has already scene throughout Disney's forty-nine other films, therefore it may leave you a little unfulfilled. There are definitely a lot of hokey over dramatized scenes that could have and should have been taken out. Jokes and drama that has been overused in Disney's past and lacks a fresh contemporary application or feel.Audiences have a film that they can take their family to throughout this holiday season. A G rating would almost suffice, however, the only problem is that there is a scene that may scare some kids. However, don't let this dissuade you from going because the PG rating fits the film perfect and is worth seeing this ""Tangled"" story of happily ever after now!",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Disney's return to greatness...,"In the course of the last decade Disney had suffered a severe decline in quality. They lost that heart, magic and soul that once made them the rulers of animation. Move to 2008 and Bolt brought a ray of hope. Then in 2009 The princess and the frog marked their return to fairy tales. Enter 2010 with Tangled a fantastic movie that has all the elements to be a classic and a great movie for years to come. The story is very simple yet the movie never loses it pace. The animation is gorgeous and the music may not be epic but is everything you can expect from Alan Menken. In overall a great movie worthy of all the attention it can get. Lets hope that Disney continues this way.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Exciting Action and Magical Poignant Scenes as Disney Goes CGI,"""Tangled"" is Disney's latest film, but unusually it is not a highly hyped as previous Disney films, at least where I live. I did not really like the nondescript generic title, which does not say anything much about the movie at all or even hint at its creator, Disney.Upon watching the movie, we see a spin on the fairy tale of Rapunzel. Rapunzel becomes a princess here, in the Disney tradition. The male protagonist is played by a charming (again in the Disney tradition) outlaw Flynn Ryder. The elements of the Rapunzel story are all there: the long hair, the locking up in the tower, the teardrop at the end... But Disney gives these things a very interesting magical back story (again in true Disney form). To make the boys come and see the movie, they include an exciting and funny action story with Flynn Ryder character, complete with thugs and chases.I personally like the non-speaking animal characters a lot -- the cute little chameleon Pascal and the mighty royal steed Maximus. I never did like those other noisy annoying sidekicks in previous films too much. The songs are not too memorable unfortunately. They tend to sound alike already, don't they? The action can tend to be a little graphic here, meaning there are lacerations and stabbing with blood, and you actually see what happens to the witch when she falls out of the tower -- unprecedented stuff. It is in fact the first Disney princess film to get a PG rating.It is a marked improvement over ""Princess and the Frog"", Disney's last film. It is not to the level of ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Little Mermaid"" and ""Mulan"", but ""Tangled"" is a landmark film in Disney history, as they finally enter into 3D CG animation territory. The effect of this animation vastly improves the quality of action scenes (like the breaking of the dam) and the magical effect of the poignant scenes (like the floating paper lanterns). This film is well worth its price of admission. It is fun, funny, exciting, romantic and touching, everything you will be looking for in a Disney animated feature film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Disney's princess movies are back!!,"I absolutely loved this movie!! Disney originally tried making another princess movie a few years ago, Princess and the Frog. That movie was not good at all!! Disney is known for their amazing princess movies, and that was not one of them, and I have know idea what happened with that movie! Now that Disney has made this movie, they are back on top with their incredible princess movies!! The music was wonderful, and the movie was a little different from their usual princess movies. This one was funner and more modern, but they still had the whole princess feel to it, which is what Disney is known for! Disney's other movies, that don't have music, and aren't a princess movie that have been coming out over the years are good too.

Tangled has that Disney magic!,"I saw Tangled yesterday in 3D, and let me just say, I'm glad I did. When I entered the theater and saw a HUGE line, I immediately noticed that every person in the line was under the age of nine. Now, while I was a little embarrassed, I was still too excited to see the movie to care that much. Tangled's heroine, Rapunzel, is a typical Disney princess. When I say that, I don't mean like Cinderella or Snow White, waiting for her prince to come and get her. I mean like Ariel, Belle, or Jasmine. She's curious about the world, headstrong, passionate, beautiful, and, of course, sweet and kind. Oh, and she's a girl that knows what she wants--to see a spectacular light show in person. But Rapunzel is stuck up in her tower with her mother, Gothel. Now, as the movie shows us, Rapunzel doesn't mind the tower all that much. She really loves Gothel, and she's kind of scared of the world outside. All she wants to do is see thousands of lanterns lit and launched into the sky, which she watches from her window every year on her birthday. This seems like a pretty reasonable request to me. But Gothel doesn't want her daughter to leave the tower for her own selfish, vain reasons (that you have to watch the movie to find out about). So poor, lonely Rapunzel seems doomed to spend the rest of her life trapped in a tower, watching and waiting for someone to come along and save her. And someone does come along! The swashbuckling thief, Flynn Rider, steals a crown and runs for cover before the palace guards can arrest him. He just happens to end up in the secluded spot of the forest that Rapunzel's tower is in. He gets one glance of her hair, then is knocked out with a frying pan and shoved in a closet. After coming to, Rapunzel bargains with her prisoner. She'll give him back the crown if he guides her to the lanterns, then takes her home. Flynn agrees. The music in this film isn't quite up to par with Disney's best (Circle of Life, Part of Your World, etc.), but since it was written by Alan Menken, it's definitely good enough to get into your head--and stay there. The song ""When Will My Life Begin"", sung by Mandy Moore as Rapunzel, is my personal favorite. The pop/country style is modern but fits the story, and the tune is catchy. The other songs are ""Mother Knows Best"", ""I've Got a Dream"", and ""I See the Light"". While Rapunzel and Flynn Rider are great characters, I have to say that a certain Maximus the horse stole the show for me. The speechless character's facial expressions and quirky mannerisms are hilarious. He seems to hate Flynn, but he later proves how lovable and loyal he really is. Pasqual the chameleon also provides some comic relief, but the one to look for is a short, drunk old man wearing only a diaper and wings. He has very limited screen time, but he always says something hilarious. I saw this film in 3D, which, although beautiful, probably wasn't a very different experience than it was in 2D, except for one scene towards the end, when Rapunzel and Flynn are surrounded by thousands of glowing lanterns. It was breathtaking. I rate Tangled a 9.5/10. It's creative, visually astounding, and possesses that Walt Disney magic that is so hard to find lately. But don't just take my word for it. Spend the money—you won't regret it.P.S. I originally wrote this review on my new blog (througharabbithole.blogspot.com), so I'd love if you'd check it out!

"In spite of often paling in comparison to most other recent animations, Tangled is a charming enough romp which ticks enough boxes.","Disney's latest is a feast for the senses in as much one cannot deny its colour; exuberance; 'crack on with it' attitude and generally fun, frantic nature - but this is all it is in regards to that age-old ""feast for the senses"" line, as I cannot say I felt a genuine nor heartfelt taking to it like I can to some of their other works and nor can I muster a reaction along the lines of being particularly moved. The film is sassy and effervescent, a film in the Disney mould of its depicting the adventures of a young, often socially starved by her father/mother, heroine getting caught up in all sorts of plots and pratfalls with a range of oddball folk along the lines of Aladdin; Pocahontas and The Little Mermaid resulting in change and great adventure. The film follows that of the Mandy Moore voiced Rapunzel, a young girl who lives with her mother and steadily approaches her eighteenth birthday. Only, she doesn't actually live with her mother but a faux-incarnation of a mothering figure – the dastardly Gothel (Murhpy), who begins the film as a haggard elderly lady before finding a magical flower enabling her to become young and stay young. In order to do so, she must constantly harnesses the power which comes about to be imbued within that of the infant Rapunzel's hair, a catch which is brought about when Rapunzel's REAL mother harnesses the life from the flower herself so as to keep her alive during childbirth. With Moore's character possessing a sort of trichological Holy Grail, and having been stolen away from her true parents, of whom look suspiciously like the king and queen out of 1959's Sleeping Beauty, she finds herself locked away in a tower by herself at the bereft of the person she presumes to be her true guardian.The heroine on this occasion isn't the best of young female leads that the American animated movie making corporation have ever come up with. Cut from a stone more akin to that of a recent, Disney-mass produced 'conveyor belt' generation of young women along the lines of Hannah Montana and Selena Gomez, Rapunzel is a po-faced; ""Best. Day. Ever!"" quipping poster child incarnation more broadly representative of this and is disappointing in this light. She is, however, ridiculously talented in an array of fields which range from astronomy (perhaps at a time before most astronomers did what they did?) to dress-making; her burgeoning young adulthood cranking things up a gear when she desires to step outside of the proverbial bubble, much to Gothel's disdain when she realises the magic she possesses will go with her.In essence, we have a film about a young girl wanting to grow up coming up against an elderly woman wanting to grow down – that is to say stay young. Said dynamic brings about the film's best song, ""mother knows best"", in a sort of verbal psychoanalytical orgy of why young Rapunzel should stay locked in the tower with her pet chameleon rather than get out and explore as she approaches adulthood like she wants to. Unfortunately, and on a much more detrimental note, we have had the likes of Black Swan released in 2011; the 'sordid' mother-daughter relationship here paling in comparison to Aronofsky's forcing drama with the whole thing, of which plays such an important role in the piece overall, landing at our feet more damply than what would have been away from exposure to said piece.Respite in Rapunzel's world arrives with that of Flynn Rider (Levi), a cocksure young thief who's a lot more handsome than his two criminal cohorts and manages to steal some valuables from a castle and get away again before having the gall to double cross his partners in crime and make off. Flynn stumbles upon Repunzel's little hideaway in amidst the hills and forests and renders it his own to lie low – and that's when all the trouble starts. The sub-plot to do with the kingdom's chase, eventually led by a cross pollination between a horse and a bloodhound named Maximus, whose clothing sticks true to his name and sees him decked out in Roman Centurion-esque garb, to get the valuables back and Flynn's own double crossed friends chasing him down does well to intermingle with the central tract of Rapunzel's coming of age story and what eventually transpires on that strand.We enjoy Rider and Repunzel's coming together extending beyond that of the tower's domain, something which kicks off an adventure similar to that of when Princess Jasmine and Aladdin first met and came to bond – the gimmick here seeing neither of them know of the other one's true-to-life foundations in royalty. I like the fact that her aforementioned trusty pet chameleon, Pascal, is mute; thus, I make it, rendering Tangled the first Disney film since that of Pocahontas to encompass creatures of the animal world whom do not speak. Where we might have had a hair-brained, fast-talking animal sidekick doing whatever, Pascal cuts a silent and often cheeky looking figure – a character who's all hand gestures and facial expressions, a character built on comedy of a more physical nature and making him infinitely funnier than a what might have been. The film, branded proudly by that of Disney themselves, is their fiftieth; if the run were a so-far indelible cricket innings by that of an individual batsmen, then Tangled is the nick along the ground for four runs through the slip cauldron thus proudly bringing up the half-century and enabling the player to raise his bat more than it is the imperious cover drive to seal a landmark. That said, the film comes with a buoyant energy; a charming love story and a fun chase narrative on top of a fair few laughs that compensate for a few lacklustre songs – it is worth a go.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
About what we might expect,"Rapunzel doesn't remember her royal parents(why is it that ""destiny"" is always a big, positive one?), as she has been locked away in a tower since infancy, trapped there by a witch(who has a habit of disappearing using her cloak, I guess she doubles as a ninja) who pretends to be her mother so she can remain young, using the girl's magical hair and its healing properties(nevermind its ridiculous strength or the changing back and forth between her roots feeling any pain from pull or not). She does wonder about the outside world(albeit she does know things that one wouldn't think she would, given that she's been indoctrinated against leaving), and when Flynn, a young arrogant thief, hides in her place of residence, she forces him to take her outside. There are more details, but that's the gist of it. I haven't watched much of anything by Disney since Hercules, especially since they went from 2D into CGI, and I see little has changed since my last dip in the pool. Don't get me wrong, this does look pretty good. Nice use of brightness/darkness of color, some memorable designs and the general animation is great. I can't comment on the acting, as the cut I viewed was dubbed into Danish. Anyway, the material is ""safe"". Over the top stuff, silliness, and in general mostly for the kids. I saw most punchlines coming, and this garnered one or two chuckles out of me, nothing more. The plot developments aren't that unexpected, either. We have a horse that acts like a dog(a bloodhound, to be exact), a chameleon as the sidekick(...I don't know, I guess they're just drawing them out of a big hat with ""animals"" written on the side) even though they hadn't thought of very many gags where that comes into play(even fewer that are at least decent... and you could excise it from the script, with nothing changing by it), and a sweetened take on an old fairy tale that had merit on its own, and will henceforth be known in the mainstream by the sanitized, corporate-approved version. With all that said, the pacing is quite reasonable, and this goes into compelling themes(and explores them rather well), such as the fear of age/death, growing up and youth rebellion. Like I said, par for the course. Not better or worse than the general piece by the studio. There is a little mild violence in this.

But today I did. I registered an account for myself, because... I watched Tangled in the past weekend. I just wanna log on and tell everybody: This is the best animated movie in the past 10 years! Tangled made my entire weekend. Tangle is simply beautiful and touching...My eyes were full of tears a couple of times. I feel like I find back the emotions when I was around 10 and finished watching a Disney movie... Now I am almost 30. The most romantic part of the movie was the princess and Rider sitting in a boat in the middle of a lake and watching the lantern show. I couldn't help but thought about this moment in my mind the entire week... Go to a theater to watch Tangled. It is worth your money.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Disney at it's best!,"Ever since I saw the previews for this movie, I've been dying to see it. But after having viewed it, it far exceeded my expectations! The characters were completely lovable, especially the chameleon (Pascal) and horse (Maximus), they provided laughs throughout the whole movie, the evil characters were also developed very well. The animation was breathtaking, especially of Rapunzel's hair as well as the lanterns released into the sky (It was absolutely gorgeous!!). I have read other reviews saying that the songs were not so great, but I found them very entertaining. In this movie, the songs do not take such a huge role as in other Disney movies, but they are nevertheless very catchy and well done (I still have them stuck in my head). I would recommend this movie to everyone (all ages), I was in the theater with toddlers who were entertained the whole time, and I even brought along my mom who is in her 50's and she loved it! There is never a dull moment, and you'll find yourself laughing the whole 90 minutes. The romance of Flynn and Rapunzel seems utterly real, due to the wonderful animation and the talented voice actors. The only thing I didn't like about this movie was the fact that I can't have a cute little chameleon like Pascal for myself!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Thank you, John Lasseter!","I clearly remember the last time I was excited about a Disney movie. It was ""The Emperor's New Clothes"". My son sort of likes ""Bolt"", but I can't stand it. With Pixar around, who wants to see stuff like ""Home on the Range"" or ""Chicken Little""? In my eyes, Disney was absolutely defeated by Pixar in every conceivable way.Which is a shame, really, since there are so many great things about Disney - nobody used to be able to tell a story like them, and their hand-drawn visuals do things that CG can't.So, what happens when Lasseter does Disney? Well, ""Tangled"". It rocks. It looks awesome - completely distinct than any Pixar film, with a beauty of its own. The story moves slowly at first, but the set-up is well worth it. There's a moment that will probably take your breath away. It was magic, the kind Disney were masters at.I loved it. While nothing this year was going to be able to beat Toy Story 3 (I mean, why even try?) this is a great 50th film for Disney. They should be proud of themselves. They are definitely back in the game, with a little bit of Pixar magic.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
unmitigated garbage!,"what a disappointment! shame on Disney for taking such a beautiful tale and loading the script with contemporary dialogue, psychology, and other claptrap. save your money and treasure their classics! obviously, the bar and standard for excellence have been lowered. reminds me of pathetic remakes of beautiful, old movies. visually, there is only one scene of any aesthetic note. the rest is caught up in ""gee, don't freak out"" gunk, weird, illogical character transformations, a screwed-up horse who thinks he's a dog (what? horses don't have enough nobility in and of themselves??), and absurd songs - not to mention some rather violent scenes that i don't consider appropriate for small children (yup, there were kids ""freaking out"" at the theatre). if you can't honor the gist and beauty of the beautiful, older fairy tales, leave them alone for others to treasure as they were meant to be written and experienced!",2.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Pretty good...,"Disney's homesick return to its nostalgic fairytale style, a move that started in 2007 with the surprisingly delightful Enchanted, has now led to a belated adaptation of the classic fairytale Rapunzel, one they'd surprisingly neglected in their heyday. While it is pleasing to see them pushing forward, and not simply looking back to their previous works and parodying them, it is also a disappointment to realise that the age of those beautiful, treasured animated gems are gone. After years of DreamWorks Animation Studios slowly beating those films to death with relentless childish mockery, it becomes difficult when watching this musical fantasy story to know when and when not it is meant to attract cynical undertones. Also, the ridiculous tendencies towards half-hearted sitcom humour and ersatz pathos that children's movies have acquired over the past few decades have unfortunately not been fought against here, spoiling most of the attempts to recreate the old magic. However, whilst it can never achieve that winsome sense of purity and innocence we love about the classics and thus join them, it still ranks as one of the better and more universally enjoyable kids films of the last ten years. The animation is attractive and colourful, the pacing is mostly slick and tight, the numerous gags don't quite get a laugh but don't fall flat either, the songs here are quite a nice addition – in particular Mother Knows Best and its reprises – and its characters are genuinely interesting. To top things off, its villain, the nasty witch named Gothel (voiced by Donna Murphy) is the first antagonist with an actually evil countenance seen in a while. Also starring the voices of Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi, it should be considered at best as a superior alternative this summer to Gulliver's Travels in the children's movies section, but by no means is it a must- see comedic musical fairytale animation extravaganza.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Best Disney film ever,"This is the best Disney film I have seen. This film is superb on every level. The story is imaginative, well-told, beautifully constructed and perfectly paced. As is a Disney trademark, the music was beautiful, inspiring and woven magically and meaningfully into the story and dialogue. The lyrics were extremely clever and witty. The genius of Alan Menkin (music) and Glen Slater (lyrics) amaze me. When I got home, I immediately went to the internet to learn more about the voices behind Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) and Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy). Their singing were theatrical and outstanding. The voicing and acting were imaginative, moving and fit the story, the characters and the moment perfectly. What more can I say ? As expected, the animation was top notch Disney. Each scene was a spectacle. I'm not that emotional but I think my jaw dropped when I saw the lanterns being launched into the sky. That scene and the context in which it was shown actually brought tears to my eyes it was so beautiful. This is a movie that will appeal to all ages.

They dropped the ball,"This movie for the most part provided solid first class entertainment, it wasn't particularly funny - except for the Horse, that was inspired - but it was lighthearted and fresh.But then it tries its hand at being manipulative and obscene, in a pathetic attempt to relate to the bratty, spoiled, over-privileged teenagers out there. I am not in that target group, and if I were as sure as hell I hope I would see through this.One might make a case about concepts like love, and family and parenting being too complicated for the average viewer, let alone as portrayed in a children's movie. But no. Maleficent had the same base story more or less, and it was consistent.All the lightheartedness in the world will not save your movie if your world is tailored to make sense only to a group who has the slightest - and tenuous at that - grip with reality. If you endeavor to make your resolution be an absolute defeat for the villain, make sure said villain is not an essential part of your world.For example let's say your plot is about a mother and her disobedient child who gets in trouble all the time, and your intended resolution is to kill it. Well.. You may think you have your bases covered when you reveal that the child was not after all biologically related to the mother, and when you provide her with her ""real"" child, long lost, which is sweet and obedient, as a counterpoint, but guess what, show that movie to a mother and she will rip your eyes out, if only to stop you from creating another abomination and inflicting it upon the world.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Belle Who? There's a New Beauty in Town.,"Rather than your ordinary Once Upon a Time, the story of Tangled starts with a voice-over from Flynn Ryder, our egotistical antihero, warning you that this is a story about how he died. This American Beauty style prologue is a clear indication that although it's a Disney movie, this story is not without the darkness of Grimm. As Disney's 50th animated feature film, Disney freaks and general moviegoers alike will be pleased to find that Tangled is worthy of the golden hallmark. It's beautifully animated, full of surprises, and really funny. I'll even go so far as to say it has the power to jerk a few tears.Disney decided to go with an alternate title instead of sticking to the original Rapunzel. It works because this imaginative retelling seems to be a little more than a story about a girl with long hair. It's also a story about an old woman consumed with a fear of dying. Her name is Gothel, and she's the figure that sets all the action in motion by kidnapping the baby princess at birth. She did this because she's aware of the magical properties that lay hidden in our heroine's golden locks: sing a special song to it, and you can live forever.Gothel hides Rapunzel away in a tower, raises her as her own, and forbids her from seeing the light of day, urging the world is an evil place. This is creepy within itself, and among all the Disney villains, Gothel is by far one of the creepiest, reminiscent of the mom in Stephen King's Carrie, from the scary way she keeps her daughter sheltered down to the scary way she is ultimately defeated.Gothel at least had the decency to provide Rapunzel with a library of books. This has kept Rapunzel occupied for all the 18 years she spent in isolation, and has made her apt at a range of activities some of us may never learn: painting, paper mache, charting stars. Still, she longs to see the world, if only to find the source of the floating lanterns: mysterious lights that fill the sky every year on the night of her birthday.Flynn Ryder's not your average knight-in-shining armor. He's more like Gaston in a Han Solo costume. Poor Flynn is in enough trouble as it is, constantly hounded down for stealing a prized possession from the royal family. Aside from the palace guards, Flynn has to deal with twin goons that resemble Jason Stathem and a tenacious police horse. Next thing you know, Flynn is stuck with a teenage girl in desperate need of rebellion.Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi provide the speaking and singing voices for our two protagonists, and do a phenomenal job. The voice acting is pitch perfect, just like the music composed by the legendary Academy Award-winning Alan Menken.I can't wait to see Rapunzel at Disneyland, not just because she's smoking hot, but also because it'll be entertaining to see eight guards following close behind to accommodate her long head of hair. The 260 million dollar budget makes this the most expensive animated feature to date. Considering the magic it will bring to households 50 more years down the road, Tangled is worth every penny.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

A great Disney film...,"Tangled is a beautifully animated film, the lantern scene being absolutely stunning. It can also be used to create fast paced comedy and action. Flynn Rider is one of the best Disney princes, as he has a fun personality that develops throughout the film. The animation allows for some fun expressions between him and Rapunzel, unlike past ones.I think the story is very thought out, giving reasons for Rapunzel to grow out her hair and why Mother Gothel wants her in the first place. It could have been really easy to phone in the plot, but a lot of time went into it. Furthermore, Maximus as the comedic relief is great. He doesn't need to talk to be funny, they allow him to have unique expressions.However, the songs are quite good but don't always further the story. Sometimes they can be a little distracting or take away from the plot. The villain is quite threatening but sometimes needs to be developed a little bit more.

A Fresh Breath Of Life From The Studio That Had Been Sitting Dormant For Years.,"Walt Disney Animation Studios' 50th animated feature still carries the label of the most expensive animated film ever made but it is also noteworthy for reversing the odds in the legendary studio's favour for Tangled marks the commencement of Disney's Revival Era and begins the studio's long- awaited resurgence towards its lost glory.Tangled tells the story of Rapunzel, a young princess whose magical hair have healing properties, for which she was kidnapped by an old witch who then raises her as her own child. Having spent her entire life in an isolated tower, Rapunzel is curious to explore the world outside, and ultimately leaves her home to embark on a magnificent journey of self-discovery.Co-directed by Nathan Greno & Byron Howard, Tangled features all the hallmarks of a Disney fairy tale yet what eventually separates it from other similar examples is its clever combination of old & new. Despite having a simple structure & treading on familiar routes, there's ample freshness in its story, the characters are beautifully carved and the animation evokes a deep sense of warmth too.Blending the best of both traditional & computer animation, the 3D images retain the painting-like quality of hand-drawn style with pixel-perfect depth & sharpness of CGI and it is absolutely drop- dead gorgeous to look at, especially that lantern sequence which can easily rival anything that the studio has put up before or since, and its old-fashioned vibe only adds more richness to the story.Also returning to the fold is Alan Menken who contributes with a mesmerising score & fitting songs and even though they aren't very catchy, they work in the film's favour. Further benefiting the story is its fluid camera-work, tight editing & brisk pace plus the voice cast does a splendid job with their respective characters, the relation dynamics are sensibly explored, and the palace horse Maximus easily stands out.On an overall scale, Tangled is a fresh breath of life from the studio that had been sitting dormant for years and the way Disney manages to turn things around is by going back to its fairy tale roots, albeit with a reinvigorated passion, creative energy & upgraded visual flair. Delightfully refreshing, surprisingly heartfelt & scoring big on quality entertainment, Tangled is one of the finest entries in Disney's repertoire. Definitely recommended.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A decent animated kids film but certainly not a great one!,"'TANGLED': Three Stars (Out of Five)Disney's 50th animated feature! They spared no expense too, at a whopping $260 million budget it's the second most expensive film in history. The film is a throwback to the great Disney animated films we saw in the 80's and 90's as opposed to the more recent (but it's still a far cry from the classics of the 30's, 40's and 50's). It's a fantasy film based on an old fairy tale again (another from the Brothers Grimm) with plenty of musical numbers. Something kids are sure to love but it may lack the interest of older viewers.Revamped retelling of the Grimms Fairy Tale 'Rapunzel'. It tells the story of a magical flower that has the power to heal the sick and wounded. It also has the power to keep an old witch named Gothel (voiced by Donna Murphy) young if she sings to it. The Queen of a nearby village becomes ill and having heard of the flower sends her guards to retrieve it to cure her. They do and the Queen is saved. Shortly later she gives birth to a daughter, Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore) and Gothel knows that the powers of the flower still exists in the child's hair as long as it isn't cut. So the witch kidnaps Rapunzel and locks her away in a hidden tower raising her as her own. She forbids Rapunzel from leaving the tower, telling her it's for her safety, and never cuts her hair. 18 years later Rapunzel longs for the outside world and truly dreams of traveling to the mysterious lights she sees every year on her birthday. When a thief (voiced by Zachary Levi, of TV's 'CHUCK' fame) stumbles upon her tower while trying to elude authorities she knocks him out and steals his loot. She then makes a deal with him that she'll give him back his valuables if he agrees to escort her to the magical lights. An adventure begins and of course the two fall in love.The movie is predictable and clichéd but it is somewhat fun and amusing as well. The animation is colorful and beautiful and the jokes are somewhat funny. I didn't find the music to be very well written though and when it gets to be one musical number after another the film starts to drag and for me becomes really uninteresting. The film is clever and visually impressive to a certain extent but I didn't find it to be nearly as entertaining as a lot of the glowing reviews it's been getting (like Quentin Tarantino's 5th place 2010 top 20 placing). It is better than a lot of the more recent Disney animated films though and as a kids film it definitely works. Overall it's a decent animated kids film but certainly not a great one.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYbw_OZUFso",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
An instant Disney classic with wonderful storytelling and music!,"I had the pleasure of seeing an advanced screening of the movie back in October, and I was not at all disappointed in any way! Don't let the trailers and marketing fool you; this movie is anything but a Shrek rip-off like the trailers would lead you to believe. The movie is a straight-up classic animated musical along the league of The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, and Beauty and the Beast. Not only does the film stick close to the original Rapunzel fairy tale, it also improves upon it by adding the Disney magic we all know and love, and that's gorgeous art, music and heart (and perhaps some twists in order to make the movie family-appropriate, as we wouldn't want an out-of-wedlock pregnant Disney heroine).The villain in the movie (Mother Gothel) is a very devious and selfish being, and perhaps the most complex Disney villain next to Frollo. In all, I love her and I think she is very unique! The protagonist, Rapunzel, is a very welcoming addition to the Disney princesses we all know and love. Her best friend, the chameleon Pascal, is hilarious and adorable! Flynn Rider is a smug guy, but charming nonetheless. The horse Maximus steals the show in most of the scenes he's in. In all, the characters in this movie are all extremely lovable! Not to mention the amazing story, visuals, and plot. If anything, this movie would be the one that starts off the new Disney Renaissance, and I'm saying that as someone who watched and loved both Bolt and The Princess and the Frog. I'm a teenager who grew up on classic Disney movies and this film definitely deserves to be one of the five best animated Disney movies ever made!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
An Evolutionary Hurdle for Disney Feature Animation,"Rapunzel gets the Disney princess treatment in this loose, computer-animated adaptation of an untapped fairy tale. In a number of ways, Tangled is the proto-Frozen. The thoroughly plastic, pseudo Pixar appearance of everything; the themes of familial strife with a supernatural twist; the roguish (and sometimes oafish) love interest; the polished, American Idol-influenced style of music; it all looks, sounds and feels like a beta test for that later, more successful, animated feature.The art direction is brighter and warmer, of course (warmer than a film called Frozen? You don't say!), effectively playing the summer palette to Anna and Elsa's winter, and that's refreshing. Doesn't seem like we get too many kids' movies this lightheartedly vivacious nowadays. Rapunzel herself embodies that spirit, constantly bursting with sunshine and positivity, even in the midst of a crisis. Mandy Moore was a good choice for that role: her voice is energetic and youthful, capable of nailing the musical notes, but also the somewhat naive optimism of an open-hearted teenage girl.The whole production is more than a little superficial, though, from the breezy plot to the hollow soundtrack cuts. We get lovely set decorations with an expressive, painterly touch, a few strong visual gags, a little dose of the touchie-feelies, and that's a wrap. Not to belabor the point, but I can't escape the sense that Disney was trying to find their way for most of this picture, running experiments that would benefit a later project, at the expense of the current effort. It's fine, no more and no less.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Tangled may not quite be on par with the Disney classics of late 80s/90s but there's plenty of magic in Rapunzel's hair for most believers.,"Once upon a time there lived a selfish woman named Gothel who found a flower which returned her youth. She kept it a secret and told no one its location. When princess Rapunzel was still in the womb her mother became very sick. In order to save the queen and Rapunzel a search was called to find the magical flower. The magical flower was found and Rapunzel was saved but Gothel had lost her fountain of youth. The flower had transfered all its magic to Rapunzel's hair which could heal wounds and reverse aging.In order to regain her fountain of youth Gothel kidnaps Rapunzel and raises her as her own. Gothel keeps her locked away in a tower and tells Rapunzel never to leave. She also never cuts Rapunzel's hair, for when it is cut it loses its powers. On Rapunzel's 18th birthday Rapunzel requests to leave her tower and go see the lights that have been appearing in the sky annual on her birthday. When Gothel refuses Rapunzel blackmails a thief named Flynn to be her guide and protector on a journey to the lights. Flynn begrudgingly agrees and the two start off on adventure with Gothel, henchmen and the royal guards all trying to stop them.The animation is Tangled is good and the characters are well rounded if a little stereotypical. Rapunzel is pretty much the same girl you've seen in most children's film nowadays. She's beautiful, insecure at times but also fairly courageous. Equipped with a frying pan to defend herself Rapunzel also uses her long hair to great effect, using it as rope swinging from cliff to cliff and tying up bad guys. Flynn is the charming thief who learns there's more to life than image and wealth and Gothel is a pretty good evil step mother with a few shortcomings.The jokes in Tangled are great, with characters making fun of the many of the exaggerated elements of fairy tales and the adventure is quiet charming. The songs are good but not classic and the side characters are fun, consisting of a chameleon and a horse that acts more like a dog.However Tangled falls short in the last third of the film. It's not that the end of the film is bad in anyway but it's just not amazing or terribly clever. It might just be that audiences have gotten so inundated with fairy tales that they know the endings to most movies. The evil step mother, without any special powers of her own, is not a quiet as scary as let's say Ursula from The Little Mermaid. The only thing that Gothel can do is scheme and wield a dagger. Her schemes are good but Gothel just doesn't have enough of a screen presence to make the film scary, which those old Disney films had. The ending ties up a little too cleanly, at least for me. Also the horse Maximus which in the beginning wants nothing more than to apprehend Flynn switches sides rather dramatically which was a bit unbelievable.Tangled is a bunch of fun and it's the closest Disney has gotten to bringing back their golden age of animation.Who this film is not for:-People who never liked the old Disney movies: Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin etc.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"""Solid, Humorous Story with a Fairy Tale Feel...""","When I heard that Disney was finally going to adapt the classic Grimm's fairy tale, Rapunzel, I was ecstatic. For as long as I can remember, I have been waiting for them to pick it up and put their own spin on it. The final product is the musical comedy Tangled, which, while not as edgy as I would have liked it to be, was still very enjoyable. The tale is kooky, funny, moving, uplifting, and—what else—Disney.Directed by the co-directors of 2008's Bolt, Tangled is a twist on the traditional tale of Rapunzel, wherein the damsel (played by a sweet-n-spicy Mandy Moore) possesses magical hair, which is kept by the villainous Mother Gothel (played with malice by Donna Murphy) to maintain the latter's physical beauty. When a charming but irresponsible rogue thief named Flynn Ryder (Zachary Levi) seeks refuge in her tower, she sees this as her ticket out of there, and off to see the floating lanterns released every year on her birthday. These lanterns are released as a memorandum to a kidnapped princess that was stolen on that very same day. Coincidence? I think not.What makes this movie work is the timing. The trailers tried to appeal way to much to the hip crowd, making it out to look like another floppy animated comedy. But, when I checked out the story, the characters and, finally, saw the movie itself, I realized it kept tighter to the traditional Disney formula of once upon a time and far away, but it was also giving off its own vibe, without trying to be something its not. The jokes all worked, for the most part, and helped tell the story instead of clogging it up with throwaway jokes, which I do appreciate.The story also shows one of personal growth, especially that of Flynn Rider, whose story this really should have been. He starts off as an irresponsible thief, trying to find a shortcut out of sticky situations with his charm. On his journey with Rapunzel, he falls in love with her spirited nature and even gives his life to save herbut I won't give too much of that away. Donna Murphy's villainous Mother Gothel was also pleasantly over-the-top, but gradually became more threatening as the tale went on. Even though she is not Disney's strongest villainess, she still is a pretty fun one.The art in this movie also helps tell the story, as well as makes everything look lush and colorful. Rapunzel's hair is one of the most awesome props in the movie, and makes it out to be something more than just looking pretty. It's used as a swing, a rope, a makeshift weapon —besides that darn frying pan—as well as a light and a healing device, which is activated by a special song. Everything else, the flowers, the foliage, water, characters, all look amazing, even if it is in computer animation. The most beautiful scene though, is when Rapunzel and Flynn watch the floating lanterns from the lagoon surrounding the palace. It was here that I started to get a little teary eyeduntil the ending.The only real problems with it were A) I would have liked to see it in traditional 2D animation and B) I would have liked Rapunzel to be a bit edgier (and a tad skeptical, but how WOULD you feel if you spend your whole life in a tower). However, as is, I think it's one of the best Disney films out there so far.All in all, Tangled is a fantastic watch, with beautiful animation, a solid—as well as funny— storyline, and fantastic songs and voicework. While not as good as Dreamworks' earlier 2010 release, How to Train your Dragon, OR even 2009's The Princess and the Frog, it still holds up.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
WORSE than a Barbie movie.,"Have you ever watched a Barbie movie? They come free with the purchase of certain Barbie dolls. The animation in Tangled is at par with a Barbie movie—the fake unnaturalness of everything, especially the landscape and any scenes with water—so sloppily generated! The characters are hallow and cliché. The main character looks a lot like Barbie, but she somehow has even less character, which I didn't even think was possible.The movie took no risks whatsoever. It leaves the heart and soul completely empty. Never a compelling moment. Clearly Disney just pooped this out, hyped it up, then sold their poop to a worldwide audience.

Disney keeps putting these kind of films out I will be a fan in no time!,"Omg how i moaned when the daughter wanted me to sit down and watch this with her as so i finally did and yes i will not complain again about the wonders of Disney! This was such a well put together story by the team of Nathan Greyo and Byron Howard, the same team who brought us another goody from Disney ""Bolt "" They seem to like revolving their stories about young girls who dream of being either stars or princesses. This time they take on the old fairy tale classic Rapunzel with of coarse putting their very own twist on the tale. Disney movies used to turn me off as i just couldn't get by the musical numbers that usually accompanied them however I thank the TV show 'Glee' for turning my taste patterns around, it's not such a bad thing. Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore ) has been held captive due to her long magical locks of hair, in a tower, now a teenager she spends the days trying to keep herself busy amidst her tight surroundings by dreaming of stars and playing with her only friend in life a small chameleon. When a chance and surprising visit from a fleeing thief who only scaled the tower to avoid be captured by the royal guards barges into her life changing it for all the good. A great story that had me , who slowly is becoming more and more of a fan of Disney's day by day, actually wanting more as the 80 or so mins just flew by.

Long live the Hairness ! (screen),"I liked so much this movie that i watched it two times on screen (my last back-to-back was ""Indi 4""): one with my nephews and the other alone but in 3D and as usual, 3D ins't the ultimate experience (Imax is better) because eyes get used quickly and the colors are darker.I was nearly tempted to name it my movie of 2010 but i prefer a movie with real people instead. Nevertheless, this Rapunzel is the best female character that Disney gives us since Princess Jasmin. To be honest, as much as it's disturbing, i found her very sexy and i wonder if her genes aren't not rated (look for a C. S.). But, looks don't make soul and her personality is as well very engaging: she dreams, she smiles and she cares!I don't know the original fairy tale but i really appreciate the lessons of rebellion and emancipation depicted here: As teens, we are torn between fear of parents and joy of disobeying and the solution is to learn how to say ""no"" to our parents. Here, those moments are showed with wisdom and talent.Finally, my niece was happy because she was lifted by this beautiful pink princess (almost a sister for her) while my nephew got bored because the movie was lacking action and fights! In a decade, i am sure he will change his opinion!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Solidly enjoyable family film with good laughs and songs,"Back when this came out I had no children, and while I did occasionally watch films aimed at children, I had no specific need to do so. Some ten years later and Disney and Pixar are much more regular in my viewing schedule, which is what led me to watch Tangled - a film I was only slightly aware of, and remembered hearing that it was not as good as other similar films. This may well be true but actually Tangled is a solidly enjoyable film throughout. The plot is broadly the Rapunzel story, but done with energy, fun, and towards the end a little of bit of touching material. As a narrative it is simple and easy to follow - which is important for children as I learnt while watching Frozen 2 and trying to figure out the messy plot and explain it simply at the same time.The animation is smooth and polished, but not to the point that it lacks character. Speaking of characters, I enjoyed all of the main ones and they were engaging and did more than the basics. The best songs are upfront and the second half of the film is noticeably lacking in numbers, but the keys ones are catchy and well written. On the whole it is a solidly enjoyable family film which is easy to follow, has a good plot, good songs, and decent laughs/adventure.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Beautiful film!,"About two minutes into the 3D version of this film, I turned to my friend and said, ""this is AMAZING."" And it really is. The depth of color and the quality of the details are simply stunning. But the beauty of the animation wasn't the only good thing about the movie, just the most obvious. The storytelling was fantastic and fast-paced, weaving an age- old fairytale with a modern reinterpretation of surrounding events. What really makes the film, as far as the characters go, though, is the personalities that Disney assigns to the animals involved. None of these animals ever utters a word, yet they easily steal the show with their clear human emotions and comedic timing. This is definitely a film I recommend, even if you don't have children.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Best film i ever seen in my life,"I am a 18 year old boy and my girlfriend wants to speak about the film please.. Hi I am a 17 year old girl and tangled is my favouritest film ever and after I seen it for the first time I could not stop watching it because I had it on DVD copy, but my boyfriend Jamie recently brought it on proper DVD for me and it made me so happy and we have watched it loads. I like the songs in it and I can never stop singing them, I also love rapunzel she is very pretty and I like her pet its really cute and her relationship with flynn makes me emotional, I wish i had her hair and I just want to be her I just love it so much!!!!!!!! everyone should watch it :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Mediocre,"I liked this work more than I did Disney's previous princess movie The Princess and the Frog, but only just. Tangled does not have what it takes to be an ""instant classic,"" nor does it have enough quality content to become an eventual one. There are too many pop culture references, herein. It breaks the spell woven by the medieval setting and trappings, and leaves its viewer feeling unsettled and (if they are an older Disney fan) rather melancholy for the older pre-computerized hand-drawn animations like Snow White and Bambi. Ah, the details in THOSE films! But not in this one. Now I'm no elitist. I love Cars, and Finding Nemo, so I am not anti-CG. I am anti-lazy artists who pay no attention to detail, backgrounds, props, and settings. I am anti-lazy animators who really believe that four lines make a face, six lines make a horse, and shading and shadows are unnecessary evils.It was unremarkable, but not bad. It was mediocre for its lack of anything resembling heart.It rates a 5.7/10 from...the Fiend :.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
What all movies should be.,"Disney is back with Tangled and they have finally found themselves again. First I have to say as much as I loved Tangled it made me sad and angry that Disney could not accomplish the same thing for The Princess and the Frog. Here was there one chance to showcase a Black princess and they missed the mark by a football field. Well so much for that.Back to Tangled. The animation is more than great. The characters are well drawn and thought out, especially the true villain-the old lady. Disney movies are only as good as their villains and heroines; this movie does a great job at both while also giving you a good hero. It is funny and bright, cute and sad. Everyone should spend an afternoon with Tangled. Though the music is not the ""knock your socks off"" great it is good and goes well with the plot. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Unexpectedly liked it.,"I found myself flicking through the TV channels with nothing else on, and up pops tangled. I begin to watch not expecting much and thinking I'd go upstairs after dinner anyway. It just so happened that I began at the mother knows best reprise, and this one musical number was enough to convince me that I needed to watch it from the top.Let's start with the characters. For a start the low number of main characters means that each gets the maximum amount of screen time and therefore it's very easy to fall in love with the innocence and divided mind of Rapunzel and the charm of Flynn. In perfect contrast to a very heart lighted movie is the chilling presence of mother gothel. And she is the star of the show. Her overly sweetened nature and brilliant animation make her one of my personal favourite villeins.However as is the case in many Disney films... It has problems. With the exception of mother knows best and mother knows best reprise (both of which are brilliant and are as good as any villein song out there) the other songs are Weak at best. The movie also tends to drag a little in places as it focuses more on the romance and less on actual conflict.That being said this is a fine film. It doesn't quite stack up against some of the classics like lion king or Aladdin but a great watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Simply Pathetic,"This is without a doubt won of the worst movie I've ever seen. It just goes to show how far Disney has fallen since it's heyday. The storyline displayed a complete lack of imagination, extremely cheesy and sappy. This movie was so dreadful it ruined the story of Rapunzel for me. My whole family who absolutely adores Disney just hated it. I just don't understand why in such a beautiful world with so much to do and so much to see anyone would see this movie. I think at some parts it was supposed to be funny, the highest level of humor portrayed is when Eugene farts. The soundtrack is pitiful, the voice acting sucks, and the story is utterly pointless. It has a terrible message, even glorifies violence and criminals. It even portrays dumb stereotypes as Rapunzel is supposed to be better with brown hair instead of blonde. I wouldn't even advise this movie to 6 year old girls. PLEASE don't see it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
The best Disney experience ever,"Tangled is the best I've seen in years, in my opinion is way better than Frozen.The two main chars are extremely likable, Rapunzel is a fantastic char, much more developed than any chars from Frozen and Levy does a great job voicing Rider.The score was made by Menken(who is a genius)and the plot is consistent.Mandy Moore has a great and suitable voice making the experience of watching it PURE JOY.The sidekicks are great too (Max the horse and Pasqual the chameleon).The lantern scene is beautifully done and the city dance uplifting!Really awesome film!The last time I enjoyed a Disney movie that much was watching Alladin...Overall Tangled is on my top list.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A Wonderful Fairy Tale,"This movie surpassed all expectations.Everyone knows the story of Rapunzel, so I'll spare the explanation - however, Disney did spice up the plot line a bit.Tangled has something for everyone - yes, even boys.

And, not to mention, the animation was absolutely stunning! I watched this film three times - once in 3D - and if you want visual brilliance, please see it in 3D.The animation - incredible.

My least favorite Disney in recent years.,"Ok so if I were to rate this for kids, I probably would give it an extra star or 2. Outside of a few rare exceptions, I am not a big fan of the songs/musical pieces in Disney movies in general, but I understand it comes with the territory so I usually don't have a problem with them, but here there are a lot of them, even by Disney standards. And in truth I found all the songs pretty bland and unoriginal. The story is ok, nothing exceptional either. So I guess an ok movie to put on for the kids but that's about it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Disney movie with the Pixar magic,"Tangled is the retelling of the fairy tale Rapunzel and has the typical Disney treatment. All the characters even look stock Disney except for one major difference, this movie is in 3D. And, boy what a difference that makes. Each character exhibits the entire spectrum of faces and emotions, the visuals are amazing and the use of lighting makes for some really astounding visuals.Who really steals the show is the horse Maximus. He doesn't say a word but he's funny, sympathetic, brave, noble and heroic all with just physical expressions. The other characters are equally well done. I really think this movie marks a significant achievement in Disney's animation and makes me excited about Disney movies in a long time. I highly recommend this movie to see the Disney magic done right.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Brings Back the Disney Magic!,"I have not been a fan of many Disney movies since the ""Lion King,"" and the few I have liked have been done with Pixar (WallE, TS3, Nemo). I grew up in the Disney Renaissance of the late 80s and early 90s and this is the first movie if have seen since the Fabulous Four that makes me believe Disney still has a place in the film business.The only down side is the soundtrack. I love Alan Menken-the first play I ever saw as 6 year old was ""Little Shop of Horror"" and the first movie I saw in theaters as two year old was ""The Little Mermaid."" I had high hopes for the soundtrack but there was not another ""Under the Sea"" in the score.Disney fans and connoisseurs will tell you before a robot brought humans back to earth, before some toys came to life, before a lion became a king, before Aladin unleashed the Genie and before Beauty tamed the Beast there was a Little Mermaid who single-handedly saved the Disney animation studio. I hope in the future we will be saying the same thing about a blonde-haired girl who spent most of her life locked in a tower!I know this is not really a good review, but for all you Disney skeptics that feel let down from the Princess and the Frog and Meet the Robinsons-this is worth your time!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A masterpiece!

The actors lending their voices all did amazing especially when singing!It doesn't matter your age or gender this movie is a must see. Great humor! Lovable characters! and some of the most beautiful images in any movie in recent memory!Simply a masterpiece!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Sweet and Witty,"Tangled is a free adaptation of the traditional fairy-tale of Rapunzel. A fairy-tale romance and adventure movie, but also a coming of age story in which Rapunzel leaves the too-oppressive maternal womb to discover the world and herself. Follow your dream and leave your child discover the world for herself are the two main messages of the film.The animation is terrific, very beautiful and colorful, but more eye catching than artistic I would say. However, the scene of the flying lanterns is just magical, extremely beautiful and inspiring, as well as the drawing of some of the forest backgrounds. The main human characters are great, very witty and lovable/hate-able. I found horse Maximus truly hilarious, and the chameleon very sweet wise and naughty at the same time. I loved the fact that the animals don't talk, still they have their own personality and communicate with their owners in their own way.The cast really shines in this movie, and I loved the fact that they were not the usual superstar actors doing the dubbing. Mandy Moore is great as the very sweet, forward and naive Rapunzel. Zachary Levi is cheeky and sweet in his impersonation of the rascal outlaw Flynn Rider. However, the Oscar goes to Donna Murphy, who is brilliant in her role of villain, and she is immediately hate-able as Mother Gothel; she is the epitome of a witch, and one of the best witches ever created by Disney.Alan Menken's score and Glenn Slater's lyric have to be praised, as they really give the movie its soul and mood. Unforgettable is the song ""I have a dream"", sung by a bunch of ugly looking outlaws, which has great lyrics and melody. This is one of the most lovely scenes in the film, too. Also brilliant is Gothel's song Mother knows Best, that sums up very well her selfish approach to motherhood. The singing by Moore, Levi and Murphy is great.I found some important flaws and miss-messages in the film, that are clearly noticeable, even for a child, and that were unnecessary. The first one is the physical appearance of Rapunzel's queen mother. She looks much younger than her husband, almost his daughter, and also looks like Rapunzel's older sister, not her mother. It reflects and shameless portrays the obsession for youth of modern society regarding women. An old man does not have any problem in showing his age, his wrinkles and whitey hair, actually that makes it more respectable. On the contrary, an old woman has too look young, unwrinkled and have her hair colored to be likable as an old woman. That was very disappointing.The second flaw in the story is the fact that, despite Rapunzel living alone, isolated, incarcerated, never putting her feet out of her tower until rescued by Flynn, she's not only able to swim but also to dive! Are we all fools or what? The third flaw is the marriage thing. The princess is rescued by the prince, but she is has turned just 18, has no experience with other humans, and less with boys, she would be almost a savage, but she is totally civilized and, even worse, she is getting married at 18! I wondered by the script changed many of the quintessential elements of Rapunzel's primitive story and did not dare to do the same with this part. They could have simply omitted Rapunzel's age, or draw her in a more womanly way (she looks like a 13 year old in the movie not a 18y.o.!) and nothing else would have mattered, as the final marriage would have made sense.Despite the flaws, Tangled is a very entertaining, fun and sweet movie for the whole family, full of action, adventure and sense of humor.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Disney Never Ceases to Amaze Me!!,"Before I begin the review, I must say that Disney has made quite an accomplishment in making this the 50th animated movie in their history since ""Snow White"" back in 1937! What an era that was!As for the movie, changing the title to ""Tangled"" from ""Rapunzel"" does indeed reach out well with its young audiences. The cast was well-selected, the animation was complex, yet brilliantly crafted, and the song arrangements felt traditional in terms of what the past Disney fairy tale-based films had done before, which captured my attention and kept me interested even more. After all, Mandy Moore did a stunning job providing the speaking and singing voice of Rapunzel herself. The song titled ""I See the Light"" was very noteworthy among them all since I felt a similar, positive feeling as I did with Aladdin's ""A Whole New World.""I wasn't bored in the least on the storyline, it made me want to see more as the plot began to develop even further. At one point, I couldn't help but feel sorry for the two main characters' (Flynn and Rapunzel) inner struggles and how they really feel about one another, but that's exactly what I was hoping!Growing up among Disney's most memorable canon animated films throughout its history has been something I've followed since I was born (the late 1980s). I have seen all of the previous 49 animated movies and ""Tangled"" has definitely made itself worthy to reside in its rightful place as the official #50! THIS is a must-see and I think I'll be looking forward into seeing it again and again whenever I choose!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
So mediocre... did I miss something?,"Of course anything with the Disney label gets a certain rush at the box office openings.That said, I really do not understand how this film did so well. Really?It was so mediocre at best. The plot was boring over all. There were somethings that either didn't make sense, or where unnecessary to the plot. The princess is weak and totally out of it. Do the girls of this generation need another princess who's dingy, and lacks visible depth? Her character isn't believable, and is only able to be consistent, because she lacks character, so is able to maintain the lack of.Her hero is a tad more mentally present, but doesn't exhibit much of what we'd want in a hero. He kind of gives a, ""I'm already in this story, so might as well play the hero,"" vibe. What was lacking was heroic efforts, or something major to be overcome, etc. Again, no depth.The villain was poorly crafted. The villain, and the villain's motivations were slightly creepy, but not enough to be engaging or interesting. Mainly, I left feeling the villain's role was just plain weird.As I said, this movie was so mediocre, lacked depth, lacked humor, lacked suspense, and there was nothing to latch on to, to relate to, to hope for. What did other viewers enjoy? The day my family saw it in the theaters, it was really quiet, no laughing, no squirming, nothing. Several dads were asleep, and the rest of the audience wore no expressions on their faces.The one surprise in this movie, to me made absolutely no sense at all. I didn't feel like it added to the plot, nor made the film more interesting. It seemed out of place and ridiculous. It also seemed like the main character just forgot about some things that would be important to remember, like the surprise I mentioned. ""Oh, that's right, I'm an airhead, I have a surprise, but forgot, oh, now I remember, (poof) magic..."" STUPID!!!I love animated movies, I love children's movies, I love many Disney movies. This was one where if at any point it had been turned off, I wouldn't have cared much to see the rest.This title stayed in the theaters for soooooo long, and is so well rated on here, I might try to watch it again. Obviously, I missed something that other people were able to see.I'm glad others were able to enjoy this film. I'm a little worried as well, if Disney gets the message that this level of story writing creates a winner, than we'll all get more of this sort of thing. Ugh! I hope not. After this and Brave, I'm ready for something more like Aladdin or Mulan... something awesome!!!",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

But I decided to give it a chance. I am glad I did, because I did enjoy the film. There were a few things that set me off a bit though. One is that you can watch it in 3D, yet the movie wasn't really made for it. I can only really remember a couple parts that really used the 3D effect. The other thing was the music. Alan Meken did the score for the movie. He also did the score for the Little Mermaid. So this movie seriously felt like I was watching the Little Mermaid every time someone would sing. It was like he took sound clips and words from that movie and put it in this movie. For the most part, the animation was decent and fun, but not amazing. The voice over cast really did fit with the characters. Zachary Levi did fit his character and I thought he wouldn't. Mandy Moore did a great job as her character. They managed to put a little lizard and a horse in the film for fun characters to watch and enjoy and I am glad they did. I really did enjoy the horse. That character had me laughing a lot.

Brilliantly realised and very entertaining,"As the father of young girls, I get to see more than my fair share of animated movies and am used to them falling into one of two categories - either quite entertaining and well put together or excruciatingly bad. I can now a third category - brilliant.This is a wonderful piece of film-making, let alone animation. The story has superb pace, a strong narrative and genuinely engaging characters. It's funny, touching and gripping - and it looks wonderful too.Of course it has the usual stock Disney characters (feisty, independent princess, cheeky animal sidekick, comedy villains, evil mother figure etc) - but, here's the twist: they actually pull it off this time - the funny characters are funny, the leading man is charming, the princess is hugely likable.I know Toy Story 3 will win the Oscar - but I'm amazed this hasn't been nominated. TS3 fell into my first category for me (entertaining and well made) but was essentially a rehash of the themes from TS2 and was neither original nor any better than its predecessors. Tangled is simply a better film on almost every level.Tangled is the first animated film I've seen since Spirited Away where I came out the cinema thinking I'd seen a great film, not just an entertaining one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Beautiful animation meets mediocre dialogue,"Tangled is Disney's take on the classic tale of Rapunzel. The story of a princess stolen away from her parents as a baby and locked away in a secret tower. She is kept there by a woman, Mother Gothel, imposing as her mother. Rapunzel is no ordinary girl however, for her hair holds the power to heal those who touch it, and more importantly for Mother Gothel, keep her looking younger. There is a catch: should her hair but cut, the spell would be broken. As we all know, Rapunzel has very, very long hair.Just days before her 18th birthday, Rapunzel yearns to leave the tower, because every year on her birthday there is a strange phenomenon that occurs in the sky; a mass of star like objects float up to the heavens. Rapunzel has dreamed her whole life to see in person where these stars come from. Her dreams are answered when Flynn Rider, a thief, stumbles upon Rapunzel's tower while making a getaway. Rapunzel hides his loot and will return it should Flynn show her where the stars come from.Though not true to the original story of Rapunzel by the Brothers Grimm, the story remains intact for the most part. This is true for the majority of fairy tales adapted by Disney, mainly to appease audiences and to entertain rather than frighten children, something all too common theme in Brothers Grimm fairy tales.That said, you can only go so far in changing a story. The problem with this film is how they start to step on the toes of other fairy tales and films made in the past (and even other studios). One scene that sticks out is between Flynn and Rapunzel in a small row boat in front of the castle. It's eerily similar to the ""Kiss the Girl"" sequence from The Little Mermaid, even including Rapunzel's little friend Pascal, a tiny chameleon (Sebastian the crab anyone? At least Pascal doesn't sing). I also found some similarities to Dreamworks' Shrek, simply because we have a damsel in distress, rescued by an unlikely hero, and reluctantly guiding her back to a castle. Just a thought.Another aspect essential to a Disney ""princess"" movie is the song selection, something The Princess and the Frog nailed last year, There aren't a lot of musical numbers, only four or five, and luckily they're not terrible. It's not their best work, but it's hard for composer Alan Menken to top his previous work, which brought him home eight Oscars (Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid, etc.) It helps that Mandy Moore has the pipes to handle the work load, even though every time I looked at Rapunzel I saw Taylor Swift.What makes Rapunzel special is the animation. This is Disney' Animation Studio's fourth feature done completely with CGI, and their patience paid off. Chicken Little, Meet the Robinsons, and Bolt all had bright spots, but all fell short. Here they finally captured the most important ingredient to properly animating a CGI film: texture and lighting. If you watch the Pixar films, you can see how with each film they get better and better with texture and lighting. As the technology improves, so does the image. It also helps that they are getting more practice with the medium.The Disney artists were inspired by Jean-Honoré Fragonard's The Swing, a beautiful oil painting true to its Rococo style, an art movement that focused on ornate, free flowing designs. Much like Rapunzel's hair the artists on this film truly met the challenge of capturing the style of the painting, creating landscapes that were unique and alive. Rapunzel's tower, the forest leading up to the castle, and the town surrounding the castle itself exemplify this style.Though I enjoyed the look of the film, I wasn't a fan of seeing it in 3D. I found myself looking over the top of my 3D spectacles and see what the film would look like, and I feel like the images would be just fine without it. Though the panorama views look nice, it's not necessary to view them in the third dimension. I understand that the revenue from 3D films is a tremendous boost in box office numbers, but sometimes it's overkill. I felt the same way for Toy Story 3.I recommend this strongly for families. The kids will love it. Those looking for a deep, thought provoking animated film in the same vain as Pixar or foreign animation, look elsewhere. Unless you can tune your ear out periodically to embrace the images, enjoy. It's hard to say no to a Disney movie, but until they can consistently turn out hand drawn features, I must issue a warning. A slight one, but a warning nonetheless.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A Wonderful Disney Classic!,"I first saw Tangled in theaters when it came out, and I absolutely loved it! I especially loved the cleverness of Flynn, and the comical jokes he brought to the film. The animation is wonderful too, and it was unlike anything I'd ever seen. One of the high points of the movie for me, though, was the songs. I truly loved all of them, especially ""I See the Light."" In my opinion, it is underrated though, and I personally think it's better than ""Let it Go."" Unfortunately, I feel like Tangled is underrated. I've seen Frozen, which is all everyone ever talks about, and I thought it was good. But now that I've put more thought into it, I feel that Tangled is much better. There are some plot holes in Frozen, with unexplained parts, but Tangled really covers everything, and I laugh at all the jokes every time! All in all, there is some breath-taking animation on display, and the actors brought the characters to life. I enjoy watching this movie every once in a while, as it brings smiles and tears to me!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Disney's 50th animation,Tangled captures all that is good about Disney animation with all the vivid colours and characters coming through combined with some strong songs and laugh out loud moments. It may not be the strongest of the 50 animated films but it is a more valid entry than previous Disney flops like Chicken Little.Unlike The Princess and the frog this doesn't feel like a girl orientated film and the character of Flynn is on equal footing with Rapunzel throughout.The voice actors are all good with Mandy Moore and Brad Garrett of Everybody Loves Raymond fame being the standouts.Although 2007's Enchanted starring Amy Adams was perhaps a better homage to the legacy of Disney there are enough elements in this film to satisfy Disney fans old and new.,6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
My Favorite Disney Movie,"I didn't get to see this movie in theaters but wanted to see it after viewing the trailer, however, due to a lack of money I waited for it to come out on DVD and then got it. The characters were amazing and I fell in love with the music and I gotta say the fact that Zachary Levi was in it did help things but it was mostly the story and the comedy in the movie that hooked me. It almost has the same feeling as Frozen but I find I enjoyed it more. If you liked Frozen or any kind of Disney movie at all I highly recommend this one because the characters really grow on you, the music is catchy, and all in all it's just a really fun movie to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Finally.,"This traditional princess story is brought into the 21st century with beautiful 3D animation, arguably the first of Disney's non-2D works to, well, actually work. Just because the studio is fifteen years behind Pixar doesn't mean it can't produce some genuinely good movies. 'Tangled (2010)' is fun, fast-paced and friendly, a nice shake-up of its source story. There are several enjoyable set-pieces and the characters are all likeable, too. Pascal is mood and Maximus is fantastically cartoonish, snappily stealing every single scene he's in. The thing isn't massively thrilling, per se, and it doesn't quite hit the emotional beats it aims for. Its musical nature also almost feels inconsequential, an added gimmick as opposed to an integral part of the storytelling. Still, these song sequences are mostly memorable and they're as entertaining as the rest of the piece. It's just a fun time, generally. If you want a princess story, there are plenty of worse ones out there. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

A Disney Classic in Every Sense,"Despite the modern-sounding title, ""Tangled"" is perhaps the most classical-styled Disney film since the days of Disney himself.What really makes this movie feel like a classic is that it digs back, way back, all the way back to Disney's roots, back in the days where the most common main character that you saw in every Disney movie was along the lines of ""A completely innocent main character discovers the world."" I'm talking Snow White, Pinocchio, Dumbo, and Bambi. And now we can add Rapunzel to this list, because this is what Tangled is really about: Rapunzel finally stepping out of her tower after 18 years of experiencing absolutely nothing but her little room at the top, and seeing the whole world in wide-eyed wonderment. To some degree, this makes Tangled feel even more ""Disney"" than even the stellar films of the 90's Disney Renaissance. We fall in love with Rapunzel right from the beginning because we want her, such a kind and loving character, to live her dreams and find beauty in this new world she is experiencing. This aspect of the film is absolutely brilliant. Rapunzel is almost like Snow White in her kindness, and yet she also actually has a real personality! I can't say enough about Rapunzel's character. She is easily near the top of all Disney princesses, mixing the love and kindness of Snow White with the realism and believability of Ariel and Belle.From a visual standpoint, this is definitely a throwback to the classics as well. The colors are vibrant and lively, and the buildings warm, rounded, cozy, and inviting, as if they themselves have been custom-chosen to convey the sense of wonderment that Rapunzel feels, like she is a child visiting Fantasyland at Disney World for the first time. This adds greatly to the tone of the film, and combines to make the whole world of this movie feel lush, romantic, and inviting. Because of this, the whole thing is a joy to watch even in its imperfect moments. There are some especially amazing scenes, most notably the floating-lanterns scene where the whole kingdom slowly lights up little by little until the whole thing looks like it is glowing from the inside. (It will no doubt be remembered as the ""iconic"" scene from this movie, like the ballroom scene from Beauty and the Beast.) Pretty much, nothing about this movie is ""negative."" It has very strong main characters with some really well-done complex relationships amongst themselves, great sidekicks, some good-natured humor, a great classical song-filled musical score that has had me humming it for the last two days, and the plot is staged without a single thing feeling boring or clichéd. And in that manner, I believe that this is the first Disney film in nearly 15 years that can truly be called a Disney classic.On the film-geek side of it, there is some amazing technical wizardry going on here. This is the best CGI hair ever put on film thus far. For the first time, we have computer-generated hair that can truly be called ""beautiful."" It shines, it stretches, and has weight that just looks right. Plus just getting the world itself to look warm and inviting is a huge accomplishment, as CGI is generally much more inclined toward producing hard mechanical edges. Great stuff! IMO, this is the biggest step forward in animation since ""Tarzan"" introduced deep-canvas technology.One other thing that makes this movie just like the best Disney classics is that it works on all levels. For the adults like us, there is some great thematic subtlety going on beneath the surface, touching on classic coming-of-age themes, mother-daughter relationships, and in Flynn's case, how often the over-confident ruffian is really just hiding personal shortcomings and really doesn't know what he wants. Plus the characters really feel like real people, and never just archetypes or caricatures. And for the kids, there is some really good-natured humor that doesn't talk down to them, a great romance story, and the film was near-perfectly-paced, with not a moment of the running-time wasted, and yet still taking time to breathe to let us see some of the acting ""ticks"" that really let us get into the heads of the characters.The only reason I am giving this a 9 is because of some minor contrivance nitpicks that keep this film just below my favorite Disney movies. The only one that I feel is really worth mentioning is the excessive use of cartoon physics. Flynn and Maximus fall off a 100-ft cliff and emerge completely unscathed. Flynn is catapulted from a wheelbarrow over 50 feet through the air and lands perfectly on a horse. And that horse then jumps over 30 feet off of a rooftop and keeps running unphased. That bugged me, and made it feel slightly like this film was taking place in a cartoon universe rather than the real world like most Disney movies, taking away slightly from its credibility. Also, there was something that kept it from feeling as ""complete"" and ""epic"" as almost every Disney movie feels, but I can't quite put my finger on why. But ultimately, these things were all minor in the grand scope of things. This was really a character-driven movie rather than external-plot-driven, and the characters are absolutely amazing.So in one department, I felt that this was as much a classic Disney movie as any ever made, and near-perfect. Due to some slight contrivances, I feel like the physical plot was a step below Disney's best, but in general I feel like Tangled is the first Disney movie in over 15 years that can truly be called a masterpiece. I actively loved almost every second of it, and immediately wanted to go back and see it again. In a world populated by movies that are either too silly or too serious, ""Tangled"" is a bright ray of sunshine that is a joy to watch at every second.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Disney's ultimate comeback !!,"I was very sketchy walking into this movie. I didn't know what to expect, it's Disney which is promising, but it's also Disney's first CGI Disney movie that got a PG rating, so it seemed different. It was pretty hard for me to choose between 'Tangled' or 'Burlesque' but I'm glad I made the decision to watch 'Tangled'.This film has everything, for everyone, boys girls and tongue in cheek humor for adults. It's Disney's answer to Shrek, but in a classy way, that doesn't feed off of pop culture.The story of the film is simple. Rapunzel is a princess that has hair that has power to heal and keep people young, but once it's cut, it loses all power. When Rapunzel was just an infant she was kidnapped by an old woman who locked her away in a tower to keep her hair all to herself. Rapunzel grows up thinking that her kidnapper is in fact her mother, and the reason she's locked away is because her 'mother' wants to keep her safe from the hardships of the world. I'd tell you more about the movie but I don't want to ruin it. Let's just say she runs away. Very simple, fairy tale plot.I was kind of saddened that Disney has succumbed to making Princess movies using CGI, but watching this movie I realize that some scenes wouldn't have the power it had, if it were in 2D. The lantern lighting scene, for example, was amazing. It wouldn't have been the same in 2D. The music, was perfect. Enough musical number to keep Disney fans more than satisfied and not enough to where it's overkill. The songs were heartfelt and meaningful, they all served a purpose, it wasn't just a nameless song thrown into the movie. The voice acting, by Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi were amazing. I was a little sketchy about Mandy. I'm a long time fan, but I wasn't sure if she had the right voice to be a Disney Princess. She gave Rapunzel so much life, and innocence, I couldn't think of any other actress who could play her better. Zachary gave Flynn life, and humor, and made him a very likable character. However, the two characters that stole the show were Pascal, the chameleon, and Maximus, the horse. Although these supporting characters have no speaking lines, through actions and emotions, you know exactly what they want to say, and the message comes in loud and clear.This movie has enough action and comedy to keep boys happy and enough emotion, romance and drama to keep the girls happy. There are a few scenes that made me tear a little, well maybe more than a little. Some scenes have so much emotion and depth that it tugs at your heartstrings, and gives you goosebumps, especially the lantern scenes. Disney is testing the waters of their film making with this one. There were many alcohol references and even references about being drunk. There's violence, people getting stabbed, and yes, even blood. Which you never see is Disney movies.Overall, I highly recommend this movie, to everyone. Anyone could enjoy this movie. It's very hard not to like it. With theater prices so high, I suggest you don't spend 10 dollars to watch Cher and Christina, but watch 'Tangled' instead. They don't make movies like this anymore. It's much better than last year's 'Princess and the Frog'. Rapunzel is now in the line-up of classic Disney princess. I cannot stress how amazing this film is. Go out and see it.Evren Buyruk from USA",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Disney lets their hair down.,"'I don't do back story' claims an arrogant Flynn Rider - the outlawed central male character of Disney's 'Tangled' - when his history is probed by Rapunzel, his equally headstrong female counterpart. Incidentally, 'Tangled' doesn't do back story either, or even side plots for that matter; viewers are brought up to speed in a narrated introduction that gives us the who, what, why, where and when in an account given by the aforementioned criminal, revealing information in a biased light and missing an opportunity to explore the motivations of characters seen in the opening scene. This would be a detriment to many a film in which the tactic would be seen as lazy, however, 'Tangled' is solely focused on the growth of its dynamic duo and every other plot device and supporting character serves only as a catalyst for Flynn and Rapunzel's development. Interaction between other characters, such as the King and Queen who lost their daughter, is limited, but these omissions aren't vital as the emotional investment of the film is purely concentrated on its main characters. In a film about a girl who hasn't set foot outside for eighteen years, Disney appropriately isolate Rapunzel even more in her own story as she ventures beyond her tower for the first time.Immediately noteworthy is the overall style of the screenplay, which resembles the witty tone and slapstick of a Dreamworks Animation product, particularly that of Shrek. It's refreshing to see Disney dabble in humour like this as Pixar and Dreamworks are both so black and white in their methods that I have never before witnessed a blend of their approaches as I have in 'Tangled', where heavy character work and physical sidekick antics compliment each other consistently, giving the film a real family-friendly consistency. While Disney may have come under fire for marketing the film towards both male and female demographics, dismissing a focus on the princess, the studio proves an unevenly skewed fairy tale can resonate with all audiences. Kidnapped from the palace as a child by an ageing hag, Rapunzel is hidden away so her captor can utilise the magic in the princess' golden locks to restore her youthful beauty whenever need be. As her prisoner grows older and more inquisitive, it becomes increasingly more difficult to suppress her thoughts of leaving; until the day that Flynn Rider, looking for a place to hide from the law, stumbles upon the tower. Joining Flynn on the run from the respective forces of authority ruling over them, Rapunzel is faced with realising her past and understanding the true nature of the world beyond her window. Aided by her pet chameleon, the hilariously silent Pascal, and a grumpy, defected police horse named Maximus, the pair become intertwined in the complexity of each other's situations. Twisting the archetype of the evil stepmother, Disney have shaped an unforgettably manipulative enemy in Rapunzel's keeper, and viewers will hang on every cunning, contradicting word she speaks throughout; the land equivalent of Ursula ('The Little Mermaid'), Disney merchandise in her image won't exactly be flying off the shelves in a hurry.Five years in development and amassing what is currently believed to be the second highest budget for a feature film ever, the tech of 'Tangled' is justifiably breathtaking. Animating human forms is no longer the issue it once was, with close-ups of Rapunzel and Flynn proudly included now that their faces can express emotions so clearly (fifteen years ago 'Toy Story' routinely depicted characters from the waist down). Their world is picturesque, where each blade of glass falls with weight and water flows according to the laws of physics. Arguably a character in its own right, Rapunzel's hair is lush and textured, and its length is managed in genius and humorous manners. These visuals strengthen many sequences which will no doubt become iconic, particularly a scene set at night where hundreds of glowing fire lanterns illuminate the sky and water. Scored by Alan Menken, who follows a genre-specific approach like the jazz and gospel laden 'The Princess and the Frog', the soundtrack is typically touching, though time will tell if the musical numbers of 'Tangled' will be memorable in years to come; they don't convey the great sense of scale the characters are facing so well as, for example, 'Part of That World' (The Little Mermaid') or 'A Whole New World' ('Aladdin'), where the lyrics encapsulate the concept of the entire movie in a more grandiose way. Described as a combination of medieval music and folk rock, the music is suitably theatrical and at times pantomime, striking a chord with the persevering lightheartedness of the film, while Menken's scoring is rousing and accentuates each character well.Introducing a lovable family of characters and maintaining a return to form that began with 'The Princess and the Frog' , 'Tangled' is a successful fairy tale adaptation that lets its hair down for the sake of having a good time, proving that the tradition of the classic fairy tale is one that should be fiddled with, rather than forgotten.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Tangled (2010),"Reading some of the reviews for this you may expect the start of a new wave of Disney brilliance. What I saw was Disney playing it safer than they have ever done before. Everything is the same, but worse. Worst of all are the songs. I pick up songs very fast. I can hear a song once and hum diddly hum it weeks later. The songs from Tangled are about as memorable as, well, if I could remember something so unmemorable it would kind of undermine my point. The film also has the least threatening of all Disney villains. With none of the menace nor charm as some of the classics, Mother Grothel is just someone you don't like, rather than fear and despise. The humour is immature and wreaks of 90's post-modernism. This same kind of narration was used in Happily N'Ever After, and there's a reason you haven't seen that film.

Disney's Comeback On Animated-Musicals,"The Disney Renaissance period was grand to the Disney company. They had made many 2D animated musicals that had turned into all-time classics such as ""The Lion King"" or ""Tarzan"" which are based on stories, legends or maybe fairy tales. But, after 1999, things changed as the movies are no longer based on fairy takes or other stories but rather original ideas. But, 2010 will see the return of animated musicals with ""Tangled"" with the addition of 3D animation and 3D format.""Tangled"" marks the return of animated musicals and will be based on the fairytale of Rapunzel. But, Disney added some changes and new characters and also removing some things from the original tale into a new tale. It's basically about Rapunzel, a girl who has incredibly long hair with magic powers. When she's still a baby, Mother Gothel kidnapped her forth magic powers and so, Gothel took care of Rapunzel and concealed the truth that Rapunzel's parents were actually the king and queen of the empire.Unexpectedly, Flynn Rider, a mastermind thief now known as a fugitive was on the run and saw Rapunzel's tower, he climbed up the tower and met Rapunzel. Then, they began to form a relationship and so it becomes a problem for Mother Gothel then, they have fights and so on.""Tangled"" is actually a great film to begin with. It is enjoyable mostly to girls but it also has an appeal to boys. Jokes here are plenty and everything was really good. The voice performances were also magnificent.The songs in this film are classical. They are really enjoyable for kids and are memorable . There are many songs here but the division of the songs is quite uneven having Rapunzel owning over 65% of all the songs.The 3D effects if the film was also satisfying enough. It was quite in depth and the lanterns part in the film was really breathtaking. I was happy enough with the 3D effect.However, there is a prominent difference from previous animated films which is the length . Mostly range from just 80 minutes to 100 minutes.

tangled,"TANGLEDThe most important thing in this movie is the storyline where gothel steals rapunzel and that was my favorite part.
Tangled is a Disney movie that talks about a king and a queen, the queen becomes pregnant and sick and only a flower can heal her, all the castle employees go out to find the flower and find it.
The flower is used by a lady called Gothel who uses it to rejuvenate. When they take the flower to the castle and give the drink to the queen, Rapunzel is born, her hair shines. Gothel one day gets into a castle and steals Rapunzel and locks her in a hidden tower.
Rapunzel's hair begins to grow very fast and Gothel locks her up and she cant go out, every afternoon Rapunzel sings to Gothel so that she would rejuvenate herself but Rapunzel doesn't know that she sings for that.
One day a man named Finch comes to the tower and runs away with Rapunzel, many things happen, Gothel goes out to look for her and catch them and Rapunzel to save Finch she cures him with her hair and then cuts it off.
When they manage to escape she realizes that she is a princess, she goes to the castle where her parents are and she gets married to Finch.

Tangled Vs. Brave,"Inadvertently I have watched this two Disney animations hand-in-hand (TANGLED is from the orthodox Disney branch while BRAVE is its flagship Pixar production), which seems to be a perfect paradigm to juxtapose them together and to dissect the state-of-the-art tendency of the mainstream genre (enormously profitable since its chief target are zero in on family with children, so it has a much more important and instructive obligation other than merely an entertainment for the toddlers and above).Coincidentally both films' heroines are princess (Rapunzel in TANGLED and a Scottish Merida in BRAVE), adapted from Grimm Brothers' tale, TANGLED is supremely reminiscent of Disney's other established princess analogs trapped in a magic world, let's say Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella, what's more, there will always be a prince-charming to deserve and requite her love. Wisely Rapunzel's Flynn Rider has been sizeably modernized as a reckless, self-mocking yet conservatively ""Disney"" prince with a thief background.But in BRAVE, Merida is a much more radical rebel by blood, she doesn't have or need a prince with white horse (the film doesn't care to proffer one since all her tribe suitors are one-of-a-kind wackos), she is fighting against her predestined life path which her mother has arranged for her and her status has requested her, a tad thread-bone notwithstanding, but chronicling with a single-linear arc, the mother-daughter predicament has slipped to the hanging-by-a-thread situation when a magic spell transfigures the Queen's appearance into a bear which cannot be recanted after the second sunrise, therefore, instigates an intimate bonding phase for the two, viscerally the mutual love only exudes when something unusual happens, while living in the mundane life, we are all suffering and grated by the love with a insurmountable generation gap.Rapunzel, on the other hand, her main barrier is the ultimate breakthrough from her ""mother"" Gothel (a greatly overlooked Donna Murphy), who raises her and locks her up in the tower for 18 years, treats her as her own out of a selfish but very understandable motivation (to rejuvenate her youth), but out of any sequential transition, all of a sudden Rapunzel miraculously remember her princess identity (she was taken away when she was an infant, so I doubt there is any memory there, more like an implausible epiphany or actually a screenwriter's block), what's more unbelievably awkward is that she immediately snarls back to her ""mother"" as if all the recollections of Gothel's evil scheme has been replayed in front of her eyes and she has been tortured for all that year long (actually she is fairly happy and content alone with her cutesy chameleon) , which I deem as a child's play, very much panders to its core audience of pre-school demography.So, from a vantage point under the contemporary context, BRAVE is far more daring and enthralling from its ""no guts no glory"" premise, it is able to identify with a way broader audience, which is also the main ingredient of the winsome recipe ""why Pixar can keep excelling all its peers (if not itself) on the top-tier of the hierarchy"", in spite of that on a technical level, all the major animation studios in Hollywood (DREAMWORKS, BLUE SKY STUDIOS, etc.) are almost equally cutting-edge.Music is Disney's strong suit, the first half of TANGLED is a conventional musical showcase, culminating the saccharine romance with the Oscar-nominated theme-song I SEE THE LIGHT, fusing with an intoxicating lanterns-all-over-the-sky spectacle, this has always been the tactic to emit Disney's overblown sentimentality, I am certain it is no longer an all-age proof method now. In BRAVE, although Kelly Macdonald and Emma Thompson's heavy Scottish accents do not get along with my ears, the exotic score and tunes are generally agreeable, and what's more admirable, it doesn't steal the thunder of the film per se.Honestly speaking after the astonishingly-acclaimed WALL-E (2008, 9/10), UP (2009, 9/10) and TOY STORY 3 (2010, 9/10), I automatically skipped last years CAR 2 (2011), BRAVE is a left-field choice, the scale of the story has been slimmed down to a quite unimaginable mother-daughter clash, even grafting it on the most platitudinous soil of a princess's tale. But by good fortune, the film doesn't smear Pixar's paramount reputation, Merida goes through a well-deployed rite-of-passage and the sub-plots such as the blue wisps, the ancient lore of the discontent brother and the witch's hut are all positioned into the right niche to uplift the mythology and idiosyncrasy of the film.As for TANGLED, Disney will never relinquish its tradition (otherwise Walt Disney will definitely be jumping inside his tomb), and it is also an exquisitely-made piece of work, just unfortunately paled by comparison by BRAVE since there is no sparks glittering and all the chirpy happiness seems synthetic and a bit stale.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Disney's animation is just spectacular,"(Synopsis) After receiving the healing powers from a magical flower, the baby Princess Rapunzel is kidnapped from the palace in the middle of the night by Mother Gothel. Mother Gothel knows that the flower's magical powers are now growing within the golden hair of Rapunzel, and to stay young, she must lock Rapunzel in her hidden tower. Rapunzel is now a teenager and her hair has grown to a length of 70-feet. The beautiful Rapunzel has been in the tower her entire life, and she is curious of the outside world. One day, the bandit Flynn Rider scales the tower and is taken captive by Rapunzel. Rapunzel strikes a deal with the charming thief to act as her guide to travel to the place where the floating lights come from that she has seen every year on her birthday. Rapunzel is about to have the most exciting and magnificent journey of her life.(My Comment) Tangled is the retelling of the Rapunzel fairy tale. Disney's storytelling version is fantastic and the animation was just spectacular. Rapunzel's long golden hair looks incredibly realistic, and all the characters in the movie are cute and extremely lovable. The animals involved as part of the story were given great personalities (even though they did not speak a word), and the horse Maximus stole all the scenes he was in. There are many tender and touching scenes throughout the movie. Disney's usual touch of magic makes this movie a home run. The movie has romance, humor, and action that will please a wide range of audiences. Both children and adults will enjoy this new Disney classic.

Early buzz has the wistful mixed bag TOY STORY 3 with a lock with Oscar voters who long for their lost childhood despite the monstrous children they show in that film, but the FAR more enjoyable experience, while still not without flaws of pacing, is Disney's deliriously enjoyable semi-musical (wonderful even if surprisingly unobtrusive score by Alan Menken) rethinking of the old Rapunzel legend, TANGLED.The funny and yes, actually sexy animated leading man and his innocent but capable leading lady anchor a near perfect animated cast. The cavalry horse Maximus who starts as the hero's chief nemesis and winds up his best ally is a brilliant comic creation nearly matched by Rapunzel's faux ""mother,"" a 21st century version of the classic wicked witch. While some of the most popular recent animated features have generated major and minor sequels, this is the first animated film in my experience where I'd love to see these animated characters AS DRAWN and VOICED reused in other, not necessarily related properties as if they were real actors. They're so much fun to spend time with, you want to spend more. If Disney had the good sense to try an animated version of George Bernard Shaw's perennial success ARMS AND THE MAN with the same animated cast they've already developed, I'd be willing to bet it would be just as big a hit.Great cast, but also a great story told with amazing freshness and insouciance. By elaborating on the well known story of the maid in the tower to create a classic quest to center their refurbished story around, the film makers also opened the door to a dazzling array of fresh comic touches (I'm with Flynn - ""I gotta get me one of these!"" - in loving the possibilities of the rediscovered old kitchen and comic standby, the cast iron skillet) and amusingly twisted sub-characters (yes, even one momentarily covered with the comic rodents that have been a Disney good luck talisman for years) with ""dreams"" similar to but different from Rapunzel's and thus touched on something universal in all of us. We all have dreams that seem unrealistic, but with determination and faith may not be. TANGLED has its heart firmly in the right place as pure entertainment so that it's only afterward that we realize how strongly it was encouraging us in the audience to follow our own dreams, but the joy and the beauty that washes over us while watching it remains with us to inspire long after the credits (which, sad to relate, are the one unimaginatively filmed part of the movie and easily missed) roll.Of course the more and more ubiquitous new 3D system works beautifully and makes the motion picture experience more than it will inevitably be on the small screen, but the story telling is so good, that when the DVD inevitably comes out, it is one which will have to be on my shelves for regular reviewing whether or not we have 3D technology on our home screens yet.When the ""previews"" are as good as TANGLED's, you usually think they must have pulled ALL the best parts, but this is one case where a film lives up to it's hype. It really is one of the few ""must sees"" of a pretty good year at the movies. (Sadly, as of January 25, 2011, it appears my prognostication re. TOY STORY 3 was prescient: the Academy chose to only nominate THREE animated films - including the inferior ""How To Train Your Dragon"" as ""Best..."" - in the apparent fear that TANGLED might actually beat TOY STORY 3 as it has at the box office. Inexcusable.)",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Wonderfully Cute!,"In the last few days of 2010, I got to see one more final movie and seal the deal on what I think is the best year of movies in over a decade. It was Tangled! I'd see the trailer of the re-imaging of this particular fairytale and thought it'd be cute with the comedic ""she's been grounded...like... forever."" I was also drawn to Tangled for the reason of being a big Mandy Moore fan. However, I did not expect it to be a musical nor to have Alan Menken (a top favourite composer of mine) to be the film's composer.Beyond being a great score with a few catchy tunes, I did find myself getting annoyed whenever Rapunzel (Moore) would break into song. It was great at first and Donna Murphy's ""Mother Knows Best"" song was great too. But after that, I was kinda hoping for just a regular movie. It was timed great and the animation worked really well to create the horse Maximus and the chameleon Pascal into comedic roles without speaking.Throughout the entire film, there was not one point where I was disappointed in it or felt that it was awful. I thought the rating of the film was perfect because although it's a kid's film, some of the romance is more aimed for teens and an older audience than a six year old. It's a great film for the year and I think it's one of the best animated films ever to be created. I highly recommend this one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
My Favorite Movie,"With these new Disney Princess Movies coming out, I felt weary about learning to love another Princess, after my love for Princess Jasmine. But this movie won my heart over in the first five minutes. I'm 14, and still love everything there is about Disney. Rapunzel is now my favorite princess, and Eugene is my favorite prince. To me, the twist that Disney made in this fairy tale is amazing! I love everything about Tangled... you might even say i have a slight obsession with it... I know all the words, and I have the soundtrack on my iPod. The music is wonderful, Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi were the perfect people to play the voices. Tangled was filled with such love, magic, and comedy. It has everything i would ever need in a movie, it's a perfect movie to watch when you're feeling down, or just on a rainy day. You won't regret watching this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
The stuff fairy tales are made of,"i loved this film! and so did my 3 year old daughter, everything about it is magical, the animation, the jokes everything! The jokes and the level of self mockery from Disney are on a par with Shrek (the first one). the horse is the star of the show, thanks to Maximus my daughter and i found ourselves in fits of laughter at the same time! i don't usually bother writing anything after watching a film, however i felt compelled to let other parents know that this film will offer sanctuary, peace and enjoyment to parents everywhere, if this film kept mine still for over an hour then it should work on most. my daughter just sat there in awe of the screen the entire time it was on! will definitely buy the DVD as soon as it comes out!!",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Loved It,"I have to be honest. I'm a huge Disney fan, so when i first came across the idea for Disney to make a Rapunzel story, I was curious as to how they'd do it. I was incredibly impressed and am now in love with this film. It's quirky enough for children to enjoy, but at the same time there's enough action and dialogue to allow older crowds to enjoy it as well. I loved it. The color and texture of colors were fantastic. I mean, I could honestly sit here and spoil the film for everyone, but I won't. It's definitely worth the watch, so if you have not seen it, I highly recommend it. Even for a Friday night film. Something that I really enjoyed with this film is that, while the story is usually told from the female perspective, the inclusion of a lead male, was impeccable. Rapunzel was evenly matched! Go see it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A beautifully engaging and touching family adventure,"Tangled is loosely based on the well-known fairy tale, Rapunzel. It's be interpreted in so many different ways over the years, that it was about time that Disney had a go! As usual, they didn't disappoint. With its stunning animation, heartwarming story line and lovable characters, Tangled is in many ways, a perfect movie. As a Disney kid, my opinion on most Disney movies is extremely biased, but I can promise you, hand on heart, that Tangled is worth watching. It keeps you entertained from start to finish, and tops it off with a sickly sweet ending, classic Disney style! Take it from someone who has watched this movie more times than most, has read the ""Art Of"" book from cover to cover and has an unhealthy obsession with it. Ignore the hate, and just give it a go, because you won't be left unsatisfied...",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Tangled Review,"At the time of its release Tangled was a true return to form for disney animation. It follows our Princess, repunzel as she longs to see the world from outside of the tower shes spent her life in. When she inevitably makes the difficult decision to leave her home, what kind of adventure awaits her (and maybe some friends) in the unknown?This film is a lot of fun and is certainly up their with disneys greatest animated work. It has very likeable characters that develop what feels like a very natural relationship and you as the viewer want to see them succeed and achieve their dreams. The film features many Disney cliches and isnt really doing anything new but its incredibly charming and manages to convey its message just fine. The musical sequences are great fun and although they do not often progress the narrative in the same way a film such as Encanto does, they do not disrupt the flow of the story telling.Tangled is a wonderful film and is deserving of any film fans time. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A CLASSIC FAIRY TALE MADE EVEN CLASSIER,"Disney makes some of the best animation films of all time, and this one's not an exception. From the story to its animation effects, it has the making of a kids classic that all people from all ages will cherish and watch over and over again. It did not try too hard to ingratiate itself into its target audience because it was what it was: a great story with a relevant life lesson. Wonderfully crafted and well thought out, the directors really took their time in creating such magical setting with adorable characters that are sure to enchant every audience from every generation. It was highly recommended!",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Not just for kids...,"I was extremely skeptical about seeing this movie for the first time. At 21, I grew up with some really great Disney movies (Pocahontas, Aladdin, Mulan, Hunchback etc.) so lately all of the new releases have been coming up short of my expectations. I was especially disappointed with the Princess and the Frog movie, so I had low hopes for this movie. However, I found myself at redbox renting it none the less. And surprisingly- I LOVED it. I thought it was the perfect blend of new technology and the classic Disney feel; for once 3D-ish animation did not bother me. The storyline was great and some of the songs were very fun (When Will My Life Begin has been playing on my iPod nonstop for a few days). The heroine was a believable character with self-doubt, and the rascal-turned-hero process didn't happen too quickly like there is a tendency to do now. Also, it was nice that Rapunzel didn't fall for the guy the moment she laid eyes on him. There was plenty of well placed comedy, some of which was cliché but not overdone. I would recommend this movie for anyone to see, no matter what their age. There were a lot of good messages in it that are applicable to everyone. Kudos Disney.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
May I present the next addition to the Second Disney Renaissance Era.,"While some may not be familiar with the name ""Disney Renaissance"", it was a sort of Disney Golden Age starting with The Little Mermaid in 1989 and ending with Tarzan in 1999. The last ten years has mostly been nothing short of the type of animation you would find on Disney Channel or Toon Disney (now DisneyXD). Disney, for some strange reason, had lost it's creative ability but now these last few years has set the pace for Disney's redemption. Pixar is what has saved Disney's film industry but now thanks to the new Chief Creative Officer John Lasseter, who also worked closely on many Pixar movies, Disney is finding themselves making movies that in a few years time will rival Pixar. Now The Princess and the Frog began this new Renaissance Era and it seems to continue with Tangled.Now this is also a different rendition of the classic fairy-tale. In Tangled Rapunzel is kidnapped as a baby and hidden in this tower by an evil woman. Her hair actually has some kind of special power that makes her so coveted. Now Rapunzel is growing up and doesn't want to stay in the tower any more. When a thief hides in the tower she knocks him out and hides his prize. She makes him promise to take her out of the tower for a day and then she'll give him back what he wants. Of course something will happen between the two and there is always this climatic battle between good and evil. But I was surprised at how much I liked it. I found the characters real and charming. The songs were definitely catchy and I can still hear them in my head to this day.There has been much controversy over how the film was made. At first I was skeptical about leaving behind the use of animated drawing but the use of computer animation was maybe the better idea. They make the animation come to life and it pulls you into the movie and that's without the story or characters.Now as for the story that was, once again, another controversy proved to be a good idea. The filmmakers take the story to new heights and even asks questions only a Pixar film would dare to ask using animation. Mandy Moore (Rapunzel) and Zachary Levi (Flynn Rider) are perfect as the leading characters. They bring humor as well as wit to roles in the most unexpected ways.Tangled isn't just another animated fairy-tale, it is a statement that Disney is back on there long-awaited top form. The title might be Tangled but Disney's return is as straight-forward as it gets. They've made their statement ""we're back and that is that."" And I can't wait to see what else they bring to the table.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Disney's Terrific Comeback,"Without a doubt, Tangled is the best Disney Princess movie ever made. While the Princess and the Frog failed, Tangled made up for it with room to spare. It had so much more of a plot than the others, and was really creative. It has so many good lines (Tangled quotes are still very common in our house). And the music was fantastic! They're the kind of songs that get stuck in your head, and you don't really mind. I think people of all ages would enjoy this movie. Even all the kids who had outgrown fairy tales would want to get ""tangled up""! Plus, the animation on this movie was absolutely incredible. Tangled is a perfect movie to curl up and watch, and I absolutely loved it. It was creative, with fantastic animation, catchy songs, and good jokes. I give it ten out of ten stars.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Shocked at how good this movie was,"Let me preface my review by saying I watched this when it finally made its way around to my cheapo movie channel, and I didn't expect to even like this movie much less love it. The characters and acting were much more charming than I expected and funny as well. Loved the slapstick and clever humor. Then, it combined that with sweet tear jerking moments coupled with the fascination of the world that only a child can usually experience. But even for adults, the characters and story draw you into those feelings. And I was constantly amazed at the quality and sophistication of the computer animation. There are many clever aspects to this movie beyond the animation. But suffice it to say, it's a great movie worth seeing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Good, but somehow not great","I saw the UK preview screening of this film -- largely, I confess, because I was intrigued by the rumoured 'Errol Flynn influences' -- and feel a little mean in awarding it only 7 out of ten, when I have consciously awarded more obviously flawed films an 8: but somehow I feel that it's good but not great.Good points: The creators' stated aim was to recapture the ""cool, retro look"" of the classic Disney animations in the 3D format, and they've certainly done a good job in that. The 3D is much less jumpy than in most live-action films I've seen, and is not intrusive save for a couple of scenes where things start to separate out into 'planes'; whether it actually enhances the film is I think questionable (see the credits sequence for a lively 2D rendition of the same characters), but it doesn't detract. The much-trailed 'post-modern' elements are far fewer and further between than publicity had suggested, and while they grated on this viewer (""I don't do back-story"" ""So you want to make me the bad guy?"") the film more or less gets away with it.The storyline is dense and well thought-out, neatly explaining a number of issues (why is Rapunzel's hair have to be so long? How can she realise who she really is? How did the witch get up to the tower when Rapunzel was still a baby?) without labouring the point, and setting up all the necessary elements well in advance of when they are needed. The 'Errol Flynn influence' is, I would say, unquestionable (although it's not necessarily presented as being a good thing, so far as the character is concerned!)In addition, there is no annoying squeaky-voiced sidekick -- one Disney 2D tradition that I can very happily do without! Instead, we get a couple of blessedly non-vocal animals who communicate in the silent-movie tradition of Wallace's Gromit: the chameleon actually manages to be very funny, and Maximus the proud horse is eloquent without a word, in addition to being much smarter than his master...Bad points: The music I didn't care for. This is no ""Beauty and the Beast"" -- the best songs to my taste were the entertaining 'character' numbers ""Mother Knows Best"" and ""I've Got a Dream"", while the big pop-style ballads don't do a thing for me, I'm afraid.And American teen-speak in fairy tales really grates, unfortunately. It's not reasonable -- if I can swallow contemporary street slang in 1930s dramas, I ought to be able to handle its modern equivalent in today's Hollywood output -- but for me such expressions as ""Stop with the mumbling"" and ""I am so not going back!"" have the same result as Hobbits scampering through fields of medieval European maize: so culturally jarring as to rip me out of the story temporarily.Overall, that's far more good points than bad, yet I wouldn't rank this film alongside ""Mulan"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"", my favourite Disney animations of the recent era. It's slick and quick and well-made, with good moments and thrills (although the latter, ironically, were a little too 'CGI' and large in scale to involve me fully), but I'm not sure it's going to be a classic. For me, something was missing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Not up to Snuff,"I didn't feel like Tangled was up to snuff with other similar cartoons. I enjoyed How to train your Dragon and Toy Story 3 and I thought I would enjoy Tangled because of the positive reviews by the critics and my family but I was wrong. I'm tired of the stereotypical side-buddy who is just there for the laughs (in this case the stupid chameleon, in others think Wall-E: cricket, despicable me: the yellow things, even in Bedtime Stories: the gerbil). The music was forgettable, I didn't laugh, plus the dynamic between the mother and daughter is very similar to real-life child abuse cases. Personally, I really didn't enjoy it but most people did.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Don't let the perfect rating by me mislead,"I considered giving this movie a 9 so that anyone looking at the rating would be less inclined to see it as from just another person who is easily pleased. Quite the contrary actually. I am almost annoyingly picky about all manner of things, including entertainment. Yet Tangled is simply a perfect 10, no way around it. So ultimately I decided to risk looking easy and give the proper score.By the way, I can only take so many animated works and in fact rejected the offer of borrowing somebody else's Red Box rental about five days ago (Planes, I think). Correction: I actually watched perhaps five minutes then shut it off. Probably not terrible. But like I said, only so much willingness to view the typical animated story.Before today, Toy Story and Shrek were both excellent in my book, yet most Disney or similar titles get skipped by me. Not knowing that Tangled fell into that category, I started watching while messing with other matters, then nearly shut 'er off in the first minute upon realizing what was unfolding, a cartoon. A couple of snappy dialog moments led me to holding on for another minute. By that time, I was in for a pound.No ""review"" other that what is written above because I really dislike being given plot details before watching a movie. The actual previews are the worst, somehow amazingly revealing the entire show in 90 seconds. Written reviews tend to be spoilers for me also, even if technically devoid of officially termed spoiler descriptions. So what you get from me is that the movie includes snappy dialogue, oh, and a few unexpected turns, plus of course likable characters and a bad guy. Take the risk.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
at last something thrilling,"So I didn't bother watching it in theater because... well because I'm an idiot. And that says all. I watch it at home but still managed to enjoy it. So the plot. I won't get to muck into it so is not to spoil anything. So there's a princess that don't know that she's a princess, a guy (cool guy) that wants money and steal a crown of our princess and a fake mother who's a... well a... whatever - you got it. So that's it, they all tangled together (it's funny 'cause I used the word tangled when the name of the film is... oh, whatever). So the plot is really enjoyable. More than that. So now that we done with that lets movie on to songs and music. They are as awesome as me. Honestly. ""I've got a dream"" is as good as "" you've got a friend in me"" maybe better. Animation is as coll as always and much better than toy... caught... story 3 which is I think compared to this is sh... well you got it ey? Acting is great. Everyone is great.

Feels like Disney again,"The past decade has seen the giant corporation that is the House of Mouse, Disney, struggle somewhat with their output, never managing to recapture the magic of the early classics, nor the rich comedy and iconic music of their 90's re-emergence. They've now bought Pixar, who are still making movies that are very much their own, and the rights to the Star Wars franchise, so money-making is still a dead cert. But in a quest to re-discover their old magic, they went back to the tried-and- tested, and admittedly dated, tradition of the fairytale, and by combining this with the visual humour of Dreamworks' output (but funnier) and some truly dazzling CGI/hand-drawn animation, they've managed to create arguably their first success in years with Tangled, a re-imagination of the Rapunzel fairytale.After discovering that a magic flower has the ability to temporarily restore her youth, Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) lives for centuries until a king steals the flower to heal with deathly ill and pregnant queen. She lives, and gives birth to Rapunzel (Mandy Moore), whose hair seems to possess the same magical powers as the flower. Gothel kidnaps the baby and takes her back to a high tower, where she grows up to be a bubbly, but lonely teenager. Because cutting her hair causes the lock to lose its magical power, Mother Gothel forbids Rapunzel to cut her hair, which by her eighteenth birthday, is about fifty feet long. After Gothel is out one day, the thief Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi), after the stealing the queen's crown, escapes his pursuers into Rapunzel's tower.My main issue with Tangled is something that plagues most, if not all, of today's musicals, and that is that the songs are simply not up to scratch. It's gotten so bad that we don't even get a bad but annoyingly catchy soundtrack by a pop star has-been (I'm looking at you, Phil Collins!), and we are forced to sit through many instantly forgettable musical numbers. But where it did surprise me, is the romance between Rapunzel and Flynn, where I found myself actually caring about their relationship, which is delicately handled and involves two easily likable characters. It certainly doesn't break any ground, but this at least feels like Disney again, even peppering the film with moments of menace that evoke Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Pinocchio (1940). And the chameleon Pascal is one the best animal characters Disney have ever created.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Charming adventure with a modern twist,"""Tangled"" is Disney's 2010 animated feature that breathes fresh life into the classic tale of Rapunzel. The film follows Rapunzel, a spirited and adventurous young woman with magical long hair, as she escapes from her secluded tower with the help of a charming thief, Flynn Rider. Together, they embark on an exhilarating journey filled with humor, danger, and self-discovery.The animation in ""Tangled"" is vibrant and beautifully rendered, capturing the lush landscapes and dynamic action sequences with stunning detail. The character design is appealing, with Rapunzel's expressive features and Flynn's roguish charm standing out.The film's musical score, composed by Alan Menken, includes catchy and memorable songs like ""When Will My Life Begin?"" and the heartfelt duet ""I See the Light."" These musical numbers effectively enhance the emotional depth and fun of the story.The film balances humor and heart, with delightful side characters such as the loyal chameleon Pascal and the determined horse Maximus adding to the entertainment.

Good film,"Good cartoon. It felt like Disney from the good old days. I guess it's a farewell note to all of us who grew up with Disney as they head out of the 'Princess era' and bring forth their new 'boy-oriented' movies. In all true honesty, even though I'm a 25 year old male, I am one who loves the classics, and don't find any interest in movies like the ""Mars needs Moms"" that was announced before the movie started. It's movies like these that made Disney so popular, and even though I understand why they decided to make this change, I feel that what Disney should focus on is bringing more movies like Tangled.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

ALL the shampoo in the world cannot un-TANGLED this hair ...even in 3D!,"Disney has done it ...again and this time, it's in 3D! It's latest addition to the princess lineup - Rapunzel - clearly shows how un-imaginative this archaic animation/movie company has recently become and it has its new movie sucked into the 3D fad too instead of the traditional use of 2D.Tangled is a loosely-based story of Grimm Brothers' fairy tale, Rapunzel. And SouthSide literally means ""loosely based"" ...watered down to the point that Disney only kept the bare basics to this story (the girl with long hair, tower and a witch, affectionately named Mother Gothel) before adding filler which was never part of the original fairy tale. SouthSide won't reveal much about the plot - let's just say Rapunzel uses her lovely locks for more than pulling a full grown witch up the tower however she doesn't remember reading about Rapunzel's hair having healing powers (reference to Disney's Atlantis movie) or an outlaw named Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) ...or a kingdom that lights lanterns every year on the missing princess' birthday. Somehow the legendary Grimm Brothers missed that part in their fairy tale version.Now toss in a horse named Maximus (a Russell Crowe Gladiator reference?) that ""acts"" like a trained dog (Hunchback of Notre Dame reference) during the film and a chameleon named Pascal with a Robert DeNiro ""I'm watching you"" complex. SouthSide found the animals (as well as the gang of ruffian bandits) far more interesting in Tangled than the main characters, Rapunzel (Mandy Moore), Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) and Flynn (Levi). There's plenty of Disney action, adventure in which binds Rapunzel and Flynn together, romance (of course - think Little Mermaid during the boat scene when Moore and Levi sing the duet I See The Light) and lame Disney humor (most of the funny moments are shown in the Tangled commercials). Sadly none of the humor didn't attract a single guffaw from SouthSide's eight year old daughter - take it as a bad sign when a movie doesn't generate any excitement from a tween girl who's loves dressing up as a princess.Usually Disney movies are filled with ear-popping, memorable songs such as Can You Feel The Love Tonight (Lion King), Pink Elephants (Dumbo) or A Girl Worth Fighting For (Mulan). However Tangled fails miserably in the song category. The songs are mostly big production, Broadway sounding pieces like Mother Gothel's Mamma Knows Best - SouthSide liked the Shadow Man's song Friends On The Other Side (from The Princess and The Frog) better. It was darker, creepier and scarier unlike Mother Gothel's in which this reviewer had to stop herself from laughing out of her seat from lack of scariness (even in 3D it wasn't scary). Yet Tangled does have one memorable (but not Oscar worthy) song - I Got A Dream that had the feel and fun of Gaston from Beauty and The Beast. Alan Menken is at the helm for Tangled's original score and songs (with Glenn Slater on lyrics) but this reviewer noticed the recycled themes from his past films and lack of creativity on lyrics.Yes, Tangled will generate the usual Disney money numbers amongst families during this upcoming holiday season however it's not truly a Disney hit or best. It won't ever rank up there with Beatty and The Beast, Cinderella or its first cinematic classic Snow White.Tangled is simply too tangled up to believe its own hype for this reviewer to like ...even in 3D.Save your money...",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
kids' movie with a good story and animation,"Even though I'm not a kid, I thought this movie was good. Much better than what I've seen lately. It had good animation and a worthwhile story that's a little different than the usual Rapunzel tale. Here an old woman finds a flower than makes her eternally young.

Really fun Disney film,"Before Disney delivered the mega-hit it was desperately searching for with Frozen, there was an attempt to nail the non-Pixar 3D animation formula once and for all with Tangled, a fresh take on the classic Rapunzel fairy-tale from the Brothers Grimm, released in 2010.With 2009's The Princess And The Frog, it looked like Disney was ready to be Disney again by finally bringing back its classic style of 2D animation. Unfortunately, that film didn't make the impact at the box-office that Disney was hoping for despite the solid reviews and it, in fact, being a hit. And so, continuing on that same Grimm path but instead opting for polished 3D animation, Tangled followed. Here was Disney's best-looking 3D animated film by far (not counting Pixar's output, of course) yet it still felt somewhat like a throwback to the studio's 90's output with the princess theme and its Broadway-style musical numbers. The story of Rapunzel, like the Frog Prince, was a safe enough choice for Disney but both stories were admittedly handled with a lot of care, and with 80's kids in mind.Tangled, it should be said, is a pretty derivative Disney film: the humor is reminiscent of the Shrek movies, the Flynn (Zachary Levi) character has that Aladdin look while Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) looks a bit like Ariel and the villain also feels pretty generic. And yet, the film manages to be so clever and so much fun that it still comes off as fresh and new. This is mostly thanks to the amusing, show-stealing combination of a wacky horse and a gecko as well as a more modern approach to the jokes and musical numbers.The songs themselves are catchy enough in the moment but the lack of genuinely memorable tunes hurts what is otherwise a very slick, charming and hugely entertaining Disney movie. One can't help but feel that this film was one ""Let It Go"" away from being the relentless blockbuster that Frozen would later become.Tangled was another move in the right direction for Disney. A little more originality, catchier songs and a better ending would have elevated this one quite a bit but, as it stands, it's a really enjoyable movie with laughs, likable characters, gorgeous visuals and a good amount of heart.Great fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Nicely Crafted Tale,"Everyone knows the story. The girl, Rapunzel, with the golden hair, kept up in a tower. She is only visited by one person who controls her. Of course, unless she were headstrong, nothing would happen in this film. And, of course, she is. Also, we know that to fulfill her dreams a guy is going to show up. This time, however, the rules get changed a bit and the formula is broken as well. I didn't gravitate toward this one as much as previous Disney films, but it was still very good. I think the title is great. I think the plot moves along at a nice pace and Rapunzel is quite interesting. Once again, the animation is superior.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

A Delightful Animation Based on the Fairy Tale By The Grimm Brothers,"Once a drop of the sun has fallen on Earth and grows a magic golden flower with the ability to heal the sick and injury. Mother Gothel sees the flower and hides it; then she finds that when she sings to the flower, she rejuvenates. Centuries pass and a kingdom is raised in the place where the flower is hidden. When the beloved Queen is about to have a baby, she gets sick and the only hope to save her is to find the magic flower. But Mother Gothel does not want to share the sun's gift and keeps the flower hidden. However, the spot is found and the magic of the golden flower heals the Queen. When the Queen's daughter Rapunzel is born, she receives the healing power from the flower and Gothel abducts her to use her magic hair to stay young. Gothel raises Rapunzel as a daughter, without cutting her hair and locks her in a height tower in an isolated area. She keeps Rapunzel far from other people, telling that it is for her own protection.The King and the Queen celebrates the anniversary of their beloved daughter releasing lanterns to the sky, and Rapunzel dreams on leaving the tower to see the floating lights from the outside world. When the thief, cheater and liar Flynn Rider steals the crown with two bandits, he is chased by the royal guard. However, he double-crosses the other thieves and flees, and climbs the tower to hide. However, Rapunzel hits him with a frying pan and hides his satchel with the crown. Rapunzel promises to return the satchel if Flynn takes her to see the lanterns. He accepts the deal and they start a dangerous journey of discoveries and love chased by the guards, the bandits and Mother Gothel.""Tangled"" is a delightful animation based on the fairy tale by the Grimm Brothers. The story is wonderful for children and also for adults, and I loved the sequence when Rapunzel makes peace between Eugene Fitzherbert and Max.

With many funny moments ( for both older and younger viewers to understand together) and many others just primarily for younger viewers to laugh at and moments for the older viewers to laugh at.

Tangled (5 Stars),"Walt Disney Animation Studios has regained its touch and reclaimed its glory. After a decade of churning out animated flicks that only served as a shadow to the works of Dreamworks, they have finally created something that deserves a place in my heart. Yeah, I agree how the latter part of my previous sentence was covered with cheese. But that's how the movie made me feel – Cheesy. I developed affection for its characters, and I felt the loss in its tragedy. Also, I released a couple of blushes towards its romance. As the loveless chap that I am, I'm usually unaffected by mushy moments in movies, but not this time. ""Tangled"" is just too darn adorable.Let me share with you a quick story. My childhood was blessed beyond grace, for it was nurtured by a loving, gentle woman: my mother. As amazing as she is, we abide by the truth that nobody's perfect, and my dear mother had poor discernment when it came to animated movies. She was numb to the genre; identifying animated characters as nothing more than plastic objects. So you could tell that I was filled with delight when she informed me that she had enjoyed ""Tangled"". The makers back at Disney must have done something incredibly right. I mean, even I had a special fondness for the movie, where most of it is directed at its young princess. If Rapunzel ever gets thrown into the real world, like Amy Adam's Giselle in ""Enchanted"", I'll be the guy to catch her. And now this movie review has extra cheese.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/tangled-movie-review/",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Adventurous and comedic fairytale.,"This is Disney's 50th full-length animated feature film, a story about the missing Princess Rapunzel, who as a baby was kidnapped and confined to a tower by Mother Gothel because Rapunzel has special powers that will make everlasting youth. However, when Rapunzel reaches her 18th birthday, she yearns to be part of life outside the tower.After watching it, I thought the film wasn't bad. The scenes of Rapunzel getting kidnapped by Mother Gothel and of the tower confinement in the beginning instantly draws you to the story. This leads to more adventurous parts where Rapunzel meets bandit Flynn Rider and strikes a deal with him to take her outside the tower in exchange for returning his loot. And, more excitement builds when the royal guards are after Rider while Mother Gothel is also on Rapunzel's trail to bring her back to the tower.The overall story has a good combination of adventure, romance and magic; it's full of action involving Rider's tangle with the guards to him butting heads with one of their horses, and, as with any Disney fairytale, includes some romantic and touching chemistry between Rider and Rapunzel. Rapunzel's magic powers are brilliantly highlighted through the computer animation, which I thought also made the rest of the film look vibrant and detailed. There is also humor in abundance, thanks in part to the goofy bunch of ruffians Rapunzel and Flynn met in a tavern. However, I thought some of the comedy was overdone; it seemed the characters tried to insert comic relief whenever there is an opportunity, doing away with any moments that are supposed to be intense or dramatic. This is especially true with Flynn and the horse, the contemporary dialog and the goofy narration.The songs in the film were pretty good and quite catchy, and I thought the music score was chilling. As the music and songs were composed by Alan Menken, listening to them definitely brings you nostalgia from the Disney Renaissance days (animated movies released from 1989-1999).Overall, it's an adventurous and funny Disney film. It does not surpass the earlier Disney fairytale movies, but it is one of the better Disney animated films released after 2000.Grade B-",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Might be the first movie ever that I rate a 10/10,"I have just finished watching, and I'm blown away! I watched Frozen last week, and I was looking for something cute and inoffensive to watch, to help me soothe my anxiety. Tangled was not what I expected at all, in the best way possible!I very rarely laugh at comedies, even ones that are targeted at adults, let alone kids, but holy moly, this movie is actually hilarious! None of the clichéd, predictable jokes - these are all golden, and make a grown man laugh out loud!I also love how emotional this movie is, I was completely invested, not even looking at my phone even once (and that's saying something). I got very attached to the characters, they are extremely easy to love.As much as I enjoyed Frozen, Tangled simply blows it out of the water, it is funnier, has more loveable and developed characters and has a bigger emotional impact.This is truly a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Very entertaining movie with genuine humour and great songs,"I am a 55-year-old man and I love animated films. There. I said it. I have avoided this film since it came out in 2010 (and it's 2023 now), because I thought that it looked cutesie and hokey. Based on the recommendations of a few acquaintainces recently, though, I decided to give it a go. What a film!! Yes, it is a re-telling of the Rapunzel story but with its own flavour, so to speak. And it was genuinely funny!! Also, the songs were actually good! I usually hate singing in animated films, and sometimes Disney films can have the sappiest, schlockiest songs. But these were wonderful. The song ""Mother Knows Best"" is a combination of great lyrics, great singing, and great emoting on the part of the actress/vocalist who performed it. The song in the Cuddly Duckling was GREAT. And the duet between Rapunzel and Flynn/Eugene was quite touching and lovely. So yes, you should watch this film.

Great fun!,"My wife and I found ourselves watching this together on Christmas Eve in Portugal. Our Portuguese isn't brilliant but we could follow the story ('Rapunzel' meets 'Snow White') and a film we just happened to find on TV kept us enthralled for an hour and a half! 'Tangled' has strong characters, humour (and it really is laugh-out-loud funny), thrills, a few tears and a happy ending. It is the sort of family-focused animated film Disney used to make. I prefer the old-style hand drawn Technicolor animation but I suppose we have to move with the times. It kept two cynical old hacks in their 50's thoroughly entertained. I would think seeing it with a family would be a great experience. Well done, Disney!",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Never Thought I'd Say This, But Rapunzel SCORES!","Disney Studios deserves a hundred-fold tap in the back for the surprising gem that is Tangled. Here, the studio infuses entertaining feats that absolutely elevated what is admittedly one of their most underwhelming creations. Yes, you heard that right, Rapunzel SCORES! Dan Fogelman merits appreciation for his superb work, weaving humor and great adventure that appeals to every audience. This, while having emotionally-provoking moments that touches on freedom and romance, ushers a balanced picture that has viewers laughing or awed by the movie's welcomed depth. Of course, Fogelman's characters were standouts, furthering the amusing triumphs. For instance, Flynn Rider's witty banters, rogue charm and character arc, were pleasures to follow. Rapunzel on the other hand, was a radiant central character, showcasing relatable curiosity and longing that were a breeze to empathize with. Mother Gothel, was an antagonist & persona impossible to set aside, as her loving facade was striking for its sheer villainy. The supporting characters such as Maximus, Pascal and the Snuggy Duckling raggedy patrons, adds layers of comedy and heart, making Tangled's world pulsate with life and fantasy.Tangled, being a Disney animated offering, dons further positive tenets with its song numbers & animation. While not as mainstream memorable as Frozen or Moana's, Alan Menken & Greg Slater's music were un-skippable pleasures. The imageries that seemingly blends CGI and oil paintings produced romantic & lush sceneries that were pure artistry, such as the iconic lantern episode.Alas, Tangled is one of the best animated pictures of the year, hands down. It is 2025 at present, and it is no surprise that this Byron Howard creation remains endearing 15 years later. 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Fairy tales always make people relaxed and happy.,"When I don't know which movie I want to watch, I always want to pick a Disney animated movie.So today I chose Tangled.

Fortunately, the entire movie is easy and the difficulties are easily overcome. The princess is more powerful.It seems that in the updated version of the animation or live-action movie, the princess does not have to rely on the prince.

I literally loved every minute of this film.The original songs were incredible, with clever, appropriate lyrics. ""Skip the drama, stay with Mama."" Ha-ha, so funny!!

The most romantic Disney,"Disney is known for a good-hearted, beautiful, and gracious princess rescued by the prince at vital moment. While it was prince helping and leading the princess out of the danger in the past Disney, Rapunzel and Flynn Ryder support each other and walk together into the adventure.In previous Disney, the prince could not catch up with princess' charms maybe because the story focuses on princess' narratives and the audience gets to hear her side of story throughout the movie. However, In 'Tangled', Flynn Rider is one good-looking lad with nice smolder, soft voice, and love for Rapunzel. This movie provides the backstory of Flynn so the audience can form the bond with him. They are most compatible, full-of-chemistry, and sparkling couple among all princess and prince.Moreover, 'I See the Light' is the most underrated disney song.

One of Disney's best.,"When German brothers Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm started collecting folk tales around 1806, little did they know that 200 years later, their faces would be immortalized on a bank note of the highest denomination. Although the Deutsche Mark has been adopted into the Euro, the Grimm Brothers' (as they have been come to be known) story does not end there. From folklore to fairy tales to bedtime storybooks, their enchanting tales have continuously evolved until its present day rendition in cinema. And so we have ""Tangled"", a fluidly narrated, vividly colorful and stunningly animated version of Rapunzel, the original title from a compiled list of fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm.In this latest version, Nathan Greno and Byron Howard directs, while Dan Fogelman tweaks the screenplay without straying too far from the original tale. In a kingdom far away (no, not the same kingdom in ""Shrek"") the Queen is aided during childbirth by a rare flower with magical healing properties. Unbeknown to the King and Queen, an old woman has been keeping herself young and alive for centuries with this flower, but now finds that the healing and rejuvenating power of the flower has transferred to baby Rapunzel during childbirth. The old woman named Gothel then kidnaps Rapunzel and locks her up in a tall tower knowing that the little girl's golden hair holds the power to keep her from aging. Naïve to the outside world, Rapunzel grows up believing Gothel to be her mother but is fascinated by seeing thousands of floating lanterns once every year. Just before her eighteenth birthday, Rapunzel's life changes forever. Having stolen a royal tiara, a thief breaks into the tower but soon learns the hard way that Rapunzel is not a damsel in distress. Together, they escape the tower and head towards the kingdom, but not before having to deal with Gothel, her assassins and the King's royal guards.For a year that gave us quite a few animated features, Disney's ""Tangled"" came in third in terms of box-office performance. While ""Toy Story 3"" took the top spot, ""Shrek Forever After"" managed to secure a second place despite its overdone theatrics and lack of originality. For this reviewer, the real competition was between ""How to Train Your Dragon"", ""Despicable Me"" and ""Tangled"", all of which features an engaging and original story. While ""How to Train Your Dragon"" is cinematically epic, our film under discussion is superior in terms of production and visual brilliance. With a budget of $ 260 million, this is not only the most expensive animated film ever made, it is also the most time consuming, having been in production for six years. The staggering amount of time and money put into this project stems from the fact that Disney has invested in animating hand-drawn images and then injecting three-dimensional depth by employing over 50 CGI artists. The result speaks for itself- a gorgeously rendered animation with such detail, it has to be watched on a HD display to truly appreciate the skill that has gone into its making. What makes this film different is that it carries the High Definition clarity found in PIXAR animations, but with the added bonus of having the original art work traditionally hand painted. I were to guess, Disney has gone through such lengths to produce another animation, probably because this is their 50th title, an accolade in itself and a milestone in this company's 80 year history as a media conglomerate.Like most other Disney productions, the story here has a fare share of fantasy, romance and comedy. Even so, Disney ventures into unchartered waters with elements of sadness, some violence and a scene of drunkenness. Voiced by Donna Murphy, Fogelman's Gothel is not a witch but a woman with a dark heart who is capable of murder. Mandy Moore voices Rapunzel and along with Murphy, lends their voices for some of the film's soundtrack as well. Zachary Levi voices the thief called Flynn Rider, a character who is neither a Prince nor charming. Although Rider and Rapunzel's initial scenes together are met with slapstick comedy, the funniest characters for me are, a royal horse called Maximus and Rapunzel's pet chameleon, Pascal. On the other hand, soundtrack is not as catchy as Disney's famed animations like ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Lion King"". Although nominated for an Academy Award for ""Best original Soundtrack"", this film lost the Oscar to Toy Story 3. Even so, Moore and Levi's duet with ""I see the Light"" is as visually stunning as it is pleasing to the ears.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Beautifully animated and a whole lot of fun.,"While this is yet another Disney princess movie, it does present both the familiar elements and add in new ones to make seem fresh and new. First of all, I'd like to state that it looks amazing from the gorgeous colours to the well textured hair. The hair was one of the animaters' finest achievements in this movie, because that's one of the hard things to do in animation.The songs were okay, I See The Light was the stand-out while the others were well performed and served their purpose even if they weren't among my picks for the best songs by Alan Menken.The comedy was actually my favorite part, because there are so many hilarious passages in here, and they weren't mostly the spoken jokes, because hands down Maximus is the funniest character from Disney in a long time, maybe since the 90's!So to sum it up, a fresh take on the well known fairy-tale princess formula with stunning animation and lots of fun for the whole family are guaranteed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A Lot Of Heart (And Hair!) In This One,"The hallmark of Disney animated films (at least of late) has always been their ability to combine humor with heart to produce an entrancing concoction of family entertainment. Simply put, ""Tangled"" succeeds once again in that vein.For a basic plot summary, ""Tangled"" tells the basic story of Rapunzel...but with a more modern feel to it. Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore) lives in a tower with Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) and forbidden to leave. One day, however, the dashing young Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) happens upon the castle and changes Rapunzel's life forever.Humor-wise, this flick will have young and old alike laughing out loud. Since it is told from the modern perspective (e.g. Rapunzel acts like a current teenager, nothing is ""stuffy"" about the tale, etc.), there is plenty of room for conversational humor and sight gags galore.Also, a very interesting animation choice produces big results: the decision to make the characters' faces/eyes as wide/expressive as possible. The film is already a visual treat (Blu-Ray highly recommended), but the emotion (and this movie is full of it) strikes a real chord in large part because of those facial features.Overall, I very much enjoyed ""Tangled"" and would highly recommend it to fans of similar Disney or other animated fare. For years I skipped this effort because I thought it little more than a ""girls movie"", but when watching it with my younger sister it was ME getting emotional...not her!",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Hands down the funniest Disney movie ever made,"If you thought The Emperor's New Groove was the funniest Disney movie ever made, then wait till you see Tangled.

When Rapunzel is left alone, a man named Flynn (Zachary Levi) enters her life.

If your excuse is because of technology, i assure you that your wrong. You can make a great animated movie without resorting to actual hand drawn art. But where is that old feeling we all use to share? Well i can tell you this much....i already knew that Disney had something special here, mainly because the VP of PIXAR jumped ship and decided to fund this project. The first time anyone from PIXAR has ever done so, let alone the freakin VP. So needless to say, Disney finally had enough, and pulled out all the stops for this one.

By-the-numbers Disney fluff,"As recent Disney movies go, ""Tangled"" is largely forgettable stuff. It looks like your typical CGI kids movie, and there's not a lot to these characters or the story.But my kid loves it, so they must be doing something right. She usually gets a kick out of Flynn Rider's antics - particularly the ""smoldering"" scene and when he gets a frying pan over the head and stashed in a wardrobe. Which brings us to the movie's real charm: Zachary Levi, who makes Rider a likable guy and infuses this movie with much-needed personality. The guy's just plain charming, and his contribution to this movie cannot be understated.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
My 2nd favorite animated Disney film,"My history with Tangled is a rocky one. Like many people I was disappointed with the trailer and thought that Disney was trying to copy off the formula that made Shrek famous. The tile change from Rapunzel to Tangled didn't sit well for me at the time either. Before I even saw the film I thought that it would be a huge disaster.Thankfully, Disney proved me wrong. Tangled is one of the best Disney films I've seen in a very long time. The story is well written and the characters are all very enjoyable(the horse and the chameleon steal the show). The animation for Tangled can only be described in one word... 'beautiful.' Every little detail in this movie, from the backgrounds to the crowds of people, are perfectly animated. The two things that stand out are the floating lanterns scene and Rapunzel's hair. Admitadely, the songs took awhile for me to get used to. It felt as though Alan Menken wasn't really on his A-game when he did Tangled, but that doesn't necessarily mean the songs are awful, you'll just need to listen to them a few times before they really grow on you.Overall Tangled is by far one of the best films to come out of Disney in a long time.

I stopped pretending I ""outgrew"" Disney. I re-watched Disney films last year, starting with Hunchback of Notre Dame, which is awesome.Tangled is a little different. I was a 17 year old well into High School, so of course I wasn't going to rush to see this film. I pretty much avoided it, but two years and several positive reviews later, I could no longer avoid it. I watched it and...I LOVED IT! It doesn't matter if it came out when you were in high school, I'm 19 and in college. I saw it last night, and I loved it. I can't explain the film, don't read people's opinions, go watch it, with no word on what everyone else thought. Just watch it and see what you think for yourself, right now! I don't know why I love it but I did. Enough said.I heard it has some problems, but I ignored those flaws. My two all time favorite films; ""Lord of the Rings"" and the ""Dark Knight"" have flaws and plot holes, do I think less of them for that? Of course not! I kept an open mind for Tangled and got sucked in to this film and loved every minute of what I saw.I will definitely watch it again. If you think you ""outgrew"" Disney, watch this, and you'll change your mind. Trust me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Disney goes 3-D -- GREAT!,"I don't have a large collection of Disney in my Library; I have really little use for ""cartoons""... It was actually a Pastor in my home church years ago that got me into it at all; he was watching 'The Little Mermaid', which is PRICELESS.... soon after, my boss was seeing something called 'The Lion King' when I walked in... 'Aladdin' followed, and those top Disney's list, seriously... if you like Disney, you have them... there are a few others, here and there... NOW YOU NEED THIS.Disney #50 goes 3-D, and this is so adorable and fun you won't believe it. I don't know how they do that with animation; I think it is subliminal messages, but this movie is such a good time it will blow you away. The animation is amazing, simply stunning. The characters are great, the story is cute and just right, it is just too good to be true. One funny note; I had forgotten that Mandy Moore was doing the vocals, until the end when .... something... happens, and when it does, she suddenly LOOKS LIKE her... and I said, OMG that's Mandy Moore! LOL It was so great! This is adorable! This is fun, big fun, and you will love it for a long time to come. GO GET TANGLED.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A baby with a hair with healing powers. A witch steals her so she can be young forever. The baby grows up thinking that the witch is her mom,"It is lovely. The singing can give you headaches but overall it is an excellent movie. It shows the parts that we wished for when watching beauty and the beast and the little mermaid. That magic pops out the screen. A beautiful and glowing flower, huge ayes and expressions from the characters, a villain.It will bring you back scenes form ""The beauty and the beast."" The tower in the middle of a beautiful garden, the mystery, the end. It is humorous and you will love the pompous horse who has a touch of Shrek's animation.Excellent story line, and the main song is as good as ""tale as old the time"" or a ""whole new world,"" and the animation is great.

Hair Rasing Adventure,"It has been far too long since we seen another animated fantasy film that Disney is best known for. As a person that has watched these kinds of films since childhood my patience was seriously getting tested. This is one of my favorite animated films because it really helped bring back the old Disney films I knew and loved.The animation is just superb, you can tell the animators were just at their A game, and the effort shows. From the background really capturing a sort of post medieval pre Renaissance era, as well as just the look of the forests and everything in it. However what impresses me the most is the character animation.The songs are hit or miss, that's what you get for most musicals. The one song that stands out for me and I feel is the most memorable is ""At last I see the Light"" which is just beautiful, it is a song of course about the romance between both Flynn and Rapunzel but also about discovering your dreams.However it's the story and characters I really love the best. Supporting character Maxamus is great, he's sort of like Duddley Do Right's horse. Like in that cartoon the horse seems to be doing a better job at exercising authority than Duddley. And I really like the buddy dynamic between both Flynn and Maxamus, there is always something really fun and touching about seeing two characters on different sides of the fence working together and bonding, we see both of them giving each other grief but also getting along and both do come though and work together.Rapunzel is great (voiced by underrated actress Mandy Moore)she's beautiful inside and out, sweet, funny, has just great charisma, energetic, and ambitious. I just love how much of a free spirit she truly is, despite being locked up in a tower most of her life her spirit will always be free. And she is a bit reluctant at times which is normal, but I like that she does go on and becomes more confidant in her actions which is something I can emphasize with. And also she's she is able to hold her own against danger.It's interesting just seeing her use non cleche items, from a frying pan which surprisingly becomes useful as a weapon though out the whole film, hey there's no weapon store/pawn shop nearby to buy a sword so it makes sense. But I really love how she uses her hair which is just amazing, you would think anyone with overlong hair would have trouble walking. But here Rapunzel we see her use to it and it's interesting seeing how well she managed maneuvering without any trouble. Her hair is indeed very useful, from acting as a lasso but most importantly she has a magical ability which is her hair is able to glow not just to light the way in the dark, but to heal fatal wounds.I even like how she seems to have this blissful affect on most people, like in that scene with the Vikings in the bar, it was kinda funny how her charm got them to reveal themselves for not being just stereotypical brute but people with dreams and needs like ourselves. But she's a character also a character that you do feel sympathy for, from the back story which is pretty sad, she's practically been a slave/prisoner most of her life unknowingly; so years of Rapunzel's life have been stolen from her let alone time with her real parents. It's just not right, that all the more gives us reason why we want Rapunzel to win, she's was meant to live free and meant to have real love in her life.But of course my favorite character is Flynn Rider (played well by Zachary Levi) he sort of reminds me The Prince of Theves character from the TV show ""Hercules the Legendary Journeys"" like that character he's a real con man whom is pretty much looking out for number one and trying to get rich quick. Is a bit shallow since he has a bit of narcissism but in a harmless sense. This is the kind of guy whom would probably be one of the last choices to save the princess but he had the luck of the draw, and hey not all heroes are perfects but sometimes to me their the best kind. He's got great charisma which is fun, clever and funny, just has some of the best lines in the film.I also like you even feel a slight sense of sympathy for him, because Flynn isn't entirely all cheerful he's been alone most of his life so he's kinda lonely; but worst of all he has no real dreams because he doesn't really know what he wants in his life let alone what he was looking for; despite how many things he stole he still has nothing. But that's because he's been looking for the wrong thing.I love the chemistry between both Rapunzel and Flynn, it's funny how both of them give each other grief. But then both of them after a long while open up to one another and warm up to each other. I like how both of them bring out something inside each other they never felt before, for Rapunzel it's a sense of adventure and freedom but for Flynn it's unselfishness and warmth. Both are right for each other you know Rapunzel's place isn't in the tower but with Flynn and Flynn has finally found what he was looking for.If the film has a message it's about not being afraid to make you dreams come true, do everything in your power or what is necessary to make it possible. But most importantly to never stop dreaming and pursuing them.Just like Rapunzel hair this film glows.Rating: 4 stars",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
BEST Disney MOVIE I have EVER seen A+++++,"How many different ways can the story of Rapunzel be told? This movie was AMAZING! I am a dad (in my late 40's), and have been to my share of Disney movies, this was phenomenal! The story, the animation, the music, the characters, the beauty, the comedy, the emotion, etc. were all first rate. Disney really hit the ball out of the park with this movie. This will be an amazing Broadway Show!! If you love Disney, and musicals, this movie is for you. It was the best $8.00 popcorn I ever bought, that's how great this movie was! You will not be disappointed. I do not want to tell you about the movie, but Mandy Moore does a great job. All the voice over artists were incredible. All the characters were unique, and the bar seen is a riot.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Disney's big 5-0! One that is breaking new grounds, with traditional techniques.","I was part of a select, lucky crowd attending an early screening of this film at the 2010 Red Stick Animation Festival, where we were treated with the presence of one of Tangeled's animation supervisors, Clay Kaytis.It was exciting to hear from Kaytis about the film's production such as how Rapunzel's hair had to be customarily animated depending on the scene - some by bone systems and dynamics, others by painstakingly hand animating her long golden locks. What was most thrilling, was to find out that Glen Keane (a legend among modern Disney Animators) would check the 3D animation on Rapunzel and hand draw over her movements as 2D traditional animation where it was necessary to show her 3D animators how to ""make her movements beautiful"" - and it truly shows!The film's story and characters are also at the same level as its visuals. The premise is great; the short story of the classic tale was fleshed out in an entertaining adventure that can easily stand on its own. The characters are distinct and carry great chemistry - especially between the two leads.The film's songs are the only things that fall short of the full mark. While they are very tolerable and help carry the storytelling, nothing memorable stands out after the first viewing (with the exception of the Mother Knows Best Reprise - Donna Murphy shines with this one). However, they may require several viewings before I'm completely hooked on them (I'm looking at you, Princess and the Frog)Tangled is the film that definitely deserves the spot as Walt Disney's 50th Animated Film. Strong plot, lovable characters and lusciously stunning animation - it's a perfect storm of the Walt Disney magic we've been holding our breath for.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Very funny Disney comedy.  I laughed a lot.,"Going back to my childhood, hearing the story of Rapunzel, there was a nagging issue that always bothered me. Follow me on this: Here is the story of a maiden with extremely long hair who was held captive in the tall tower waiting for her prince to come and rescue her. When he arrives, he implores her ""Rapunzel! Rapunzel! Let down your hair!"", to which she drops her hair down to ground level so he can climb it like a rope. Here's my issue: He's a grown man, climbing her hair like a rope . . . that is attached to her head! How is her hair not being pulled out by the roots?That's a question, I'm afraid that no one seems to be able to properly answer, neither in the 199 year-old tale told first written by The Brother's Grimm nor in Disney's lively new computer-animated version which turns Rapunzel's over-developed locks into a tool of 1001 uses. Seriously, she hangs from it, makes a jump rope with it, and even ties the intruding prince to a chair with it. I guess the easy answer is: her hair is magic, lay off! Here it is explained that her blond locks have the power to heal when she sings a certain song. What happens if she gets the words wrong?The story in this version tells us that when Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore) was a baby, her hair was accidentally enchanted by an old crone called Mother Gothel (voiced by Donna Murphy) who had discovered a spell for retaining her youth and beauty. In order to keep the enchantment safe, she kidnapped the child, pretended to be her mother and locked her in a tall tower and forbade her to step outside. As Rapunzel grew up, she wondered, naturally, what was out there. As she grows, so does her hair. If she cuts it, her hair turns brown and the spell dies. Got it? Good!Her salvation is not a regal prince but a thieving goof named Flynn Rider (voiced by Zachary Levi of TV's ""Chuck""). Flynn is not his real name, I'll leave that for you to discover. Anyway, he has stolen some crown jewels and is on the run from some of the palace guards. He finds himself stashing away in Rapunzel's tower until the heat's off - that's how he comes to find himself tied to a chair by her long hair. Naturally the story will involve the pair falling in love and doing battle with Mother Gothel for the enchantment that lies within those golden tresses.The story is a bit standard. The love story, the magic spell, the villain, the music. They are all lifted from a hundred other Disney musicals. I think the screenwriters knew that because they were smart enough to give the movie a wicked sense of humor. All of the characters have bold personalities, whip-smart dialogue and wonderfully expressive faces. This is a fun movie just to listen to. In tone, the movie has the kind of wise-cracky freshness and sense of humor that made Shrek so special (and that its sequels never quite achieved).The film also benefits from the presence of two wonderful supporting characters. One is a chameleon who is Rapunzel's only companion. His face is very expressive and so is his ever-shifting skin color the functions like a mood ring. The other is a very clever horse, part of the king's guard. He is ever-efficient and ever-determined to hunt down Flynn and bring him to justice. This is some horse, not only is he a beast of burden but he's also part bloodhound and, at one point, a pretty good swordsman. The fact that these two characters never speak allows their body language to speak for them. They are more expressive that way.'Tangled' is part of the new 3D revolution. The palette is made of vibrant with colors that are clean and polished. The characters almost resemble Barbie Dolls. That may be the film's only real flaw, it is too clean. There's nothing in the artistry to make it distinctive or to further the art of animation or to try new things. Immediately after I saw Tangled, I saw the wonderful Irish animated feature The Secret of Kells - this happened purely by coincidence. That film had a texture and a form of the illustrations one might find in a children's story book. The characters were angular, squared and pointed in a way that matched their personalities (Think of the form of ""Samurai Jack"" and you get the idea""). Here the characters and the landscapes all look manufactured. We don't feel we're looking at a special place, just a manufactured background. Still, with that limitation, I had a good time. I laugh a lot, the characters intrigued me and I walked away with the image of a man with a frying pan dueling a horse with a sword. Where else are you going to see that?",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Absolutely love it!,"I've grown up watching Disney movies all my life. So many princess movies I've seen, and Tangled had blown me away. Absolutely loved it.

Witch that Rapunzel thinks is her mother. Dance and Music that is entertaining and enjoyable. Innocence that is in Rapunzel, and how it reflects in others. Lanterns that fills the sky on Rapunzel's birthday. All in All, a perfect movie to watch.The magic words that heal: Flower gleam and glow, Let your power shine.. Make the clock reverse, bring back what ones was mine!!! Heal what has been hurt, change the fates design.. Make the clock reverse, bring back what ones was mine!!!Song that feels: And at last I see the light. And it's like the fog has lifted. And at last I see the light. And it's like the sky is new. And it's warm and real and bright. And the world has somehow shifted. All at once everything looks different. Now that I see you.A family entertainer, one you can watch as many times you want.

A story of good triumphing over evil.  Always a good tale to see in this day and time.,"This recent Disney movie is a great movie all around. Donna Murphy has a wonderful voice as does Mandy Moore. However, the Broadway experience of Donna Murphy comes through in her character and even some of the movements the character makes in the movie. Someone was really giving an eye to detail with this character. The movie in 3D was very entertaining and magical. It made me feel as if I was in Disney World. This movie has all the great Disney ingredients: vivid color, action, humor, incredible animation, a wonderful story and a happy ending! The animal characters as well as the human characters are so entertaining and with the 3D you feel they are almost in your lap.

now hair this,"Disney's 50th animated feature is an adaptation of the story of Rapunzel. I thought it neat that Maximus and Pascal put on a performance reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. Usually this is the sort of movie that I would spend the whole time heckling like on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"", but I didn't heckle ""Tangled"". I guess that Rapunzel's assertive qualities made her more interesting than previous princesses, kind of like Elsa and Anna in ""Frozen"".And of course I can't resist noting the cast. I only loosely know about Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi. I understand that Donna Murphy is mainly a Broadway star. The rest of the cast catches my attention: Brad Garrett (Everybody Loves Raymond), Ron Perlman (Hellboy), Jeffrey Tambor (Arrested Development) and Richard Kiel (a 7-foot actor best known for a role in the James Bond franchise).So, it's an OK, enjoyable movie.

Rapunzel - Animated,"It was about time that any animation studio would make a film based on one of my favorite fairytales, Rapunzel, and I was glad Disney was the studio to make it. I saw the film only last weekend, and I thought it was awesome.The film narrates the story of a wicked woman named Gothel, who uses a magical golden flower, born from a ray of sunshine, to restore her youth and beauty. A few centuries later, someone built a kingdom, and just as the king and queen were expecting a baby, the queen fell very ill. The villagers search for the flower, and the king's soldiers return it to the queen. A baby girl, Rapunzel, is born to the royal couple, and everyone is happy. Gothel, jealous and spiteful, kidnaps Rapunzel and raises her as her own daughter. Rapunzel's golden hair retains the flower's healing abilities, but the kingdom sends thousands of floating lanterns into the sky every year on her birthday. Eighteen years later, Flynn Rider steals the princess' tiara and discovers her tower to be a hideaway. After climbing the tower, Flynn finds himself in Rapunzel's clutches, and she agrees to help her find the source of the floating lights she sees on her birthday.No spoilers here!

Animation excellence,"This review won't really be useful to many people as I come at this film as an animation student. There have been precious few 2D or 3D animated productions that cam capture your heart and mind. We have the giants like Spirited away and Grave of the Fireflies in the 2D world and really anything from Pixar except Cars to love. Precious few others. Ice Age nailed it but most Dreamworks productions fail to capture the sheer brilliance that can be a character in motion. Despicable Me is another that just brought the characters to life and here with Tangled, we have that same excellence in character animation. Every character from the adorable chameleon to the angry horse are characters you'll love, not because of the story but simply because of the level of animation at play here.There's an extra level of realism in this movie that you don't normally see too. There are moments during the movie where a characters face isn't seen and you lose sight of the fact it's just stylized 3D animation. The water scenes are particularly stand out brilliant cinematic moments with incredible realism. These scenes must have been globally illuminated to death. I dare not guess how long these frames must have taken to render.But just like any special effects heavy movie, without a great story and equally great performance, you'll soon tire of it. Tangled doesn't disappoint there. The story is great fun, inventive and very much a wild spin on a very old fairytale. The performances from the real voice actors are devilishly good. It's surprising there weren't more BIG names doing the voices but satisfying to know that this really doesn't matter. The actors aren't phoning in these lines, they are nuanced, operatic and multi layered really helping give the animated characters much more depth.For me it's the tiny moments that make the movie, not just the great slapstick moments but the way the characters emote. Rapunzel isn't sure of a new character entering the scene? Sure she has that look of trepidation and fear but the emoting is so dynamic and rich that you can almost see the characters thinking their emotions through from moment to moment. It's quite intense and I found myself a number of times being drawn towards the screen, feeling what Rapunzel was feeling. Almost mirroring the emotions as you might do with while talking to a great friend or partner.So as I said at the beginning, this review probably not going to be so good for the average viewer wanting to find out whether to take the kids to see this but if you appreciate animation as an art form or even appreciate the technical skill involved in animation as pure entertainment. You must see this, you must go and see it again and then you must buy it, download it or otherwise get your hands on this and have it in your collection for happily, ever, after.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
The Defensive Usefulness of a Frying Pan,"After years, Disney has delivered something charming and entertaining. Let's not even get to those straight-to-video sequels and spin-offs (of which only a tiny few were likable). This is Disney's first major CGI movie. The success of it may set a new trend for future Disney films as a result of which I'll miss the beautiful hand-drawn works that contributed in making classics of so many of their older films.However, the animation in 'Tangled' is first rate and definitely up their with Pixar. The enchanting fairy tale world looks colourful and magical. The details and movements are very well done. The story is told in a very Disney fashion with added tongue-in-cheek humour and the occasional songs. The songs contribute well to the story-telling and the jokes work effectively. There are a few plot holes but given that it's based on a fairy tail (Rapunzel) these things can easily be overlooked.The voice acting is very good. Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi are adequate as the typical Disney princess and Disney hero. However, Donna Murphy steals the show as the evil Mother Gothel and the supporting cast is great. Brad Garrett's Hook-hand thug is hilarious.My favourite character was Rapunzel's chameleon sidekick who provides some excellent subtle comic relief and Max, the horse.Only time will tell whether this will be a classic but as for now, Disney seems to be back in providing some quality entertainment.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Patented Disney,"Flynn Rider: ""You smell that? It's part man-smell, and the other part is really bad man-smell, but overall it just smells like the color brown. Your thoughts?""Tangled is not the Rapunzel story your mom grew up on. As the above quote attests, Disney has post-modernized it with updated, semi-hip dialogue and some Freudian notions that fit the story's thematic base. Disney has made a fun movie of an old fairy-tale chestnut, not as complex as Princess and the Frog, but good enough to be the studio's 50th animation and going strong.How does 26 years old Mandy Moore's voice sound like 18-year old's? It does, and I'm impressed with the whole angle of vision that emphasizes the needs of pre-teens and teens to bolt from the nest and see the world as it is, not through parents' eyes, while promoting the value of family, real family that is.Supposedly the visual style, an effective use of 3D, has the properties of ""The Swing,"" a romantic painting by Jean-Honore Fragonard. Whatever, the hair of the two leads, and even wicked ""mom,"" is textured and layered in a most realistic,yet romantically stylized fashion.Disney is canny enough to use Rapunzel's hair as a weapon, similar to Indiana Jones's whip, to take the staid glam out of its tradition and make it useful for more than a ladder. Even the sidekick chameleon, to be almost as welcomed as Donkey in Shreck, has reactions reflecting the modern cynicism rather than the cute simpleton.In its further favor, the love between the two teens is not in the Twilight longing motif—it rather it grows organically from a mutual respect, not lust divorced from the idealized bodies Disney distractingly offers in its animations. In short, your thinking youngsters should love the ironies Tangled offers while it entertains with patented Disney humanity.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A tame joyful film for the whole family. Just no big hit.,"This movie conforms to all rules classical Disney films set up. Old Brothers Grimm story? Check. Boy saves princess? Check. Singing? Check. Sidekicks providing humor? Check. Happy End...? I guess thats barely a spoiler...That is as good a fact as it is bad. It all depends on how one stands toward these. Do you like this rigid screenplay framework? Then you'll probably enjoy this. And as such it probably works for the whole family.I still gave it a 5/10 for being so tame. There isn't any real villain in there, even the old woman isn't evil by heart. The problem i see here is that in this way the male protagonist can't portray the hero as good as the kitschy rest of the movie wants him to be. He's merely a thief and pretty much receives the grand price, the hand of the princess, without all too much deserving it. All he had to do is run off with her, pretty much true to his trade.In my point this is one reason why the classics are the classics and this one never will be. Cinderella, Snow Wite, the Junglebook, Aladdin, Lionking... They all had great villains and thanks to those were great in making heroes. It's a pity that got lost somewhere.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Worth adding to your collection,"Being a 26 year old male that usually finds action/scifi type movies more preferable, I did not expect that I would end up liking this film. My dad set up a 3d projector system at home and we've been struggling to find good 3d content, so as a last effort a week ago we purchased Tangled 3D. After watching the film at length, I was pleasantly entertained. A lot of animated children's' films seem rather cheesy to me, but this one was different. I would have to say that the film excelled in character development, and that was what set it apart from many others. The characters have memorable personalities that draw you in, and overall the film evokes a dynamic range of emotional sensationalism from comical, to happy, to sad. At its conclusion, it leaves you with a feel-good type of movie-watching experience. Altogether, the textures and the 3D looked gorgeous on our home 3D system. Overall, definitely a film worth having. You will not be disappointed.Thats it for my 2 cents worth.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Amazing Movie!,"This movie was just great in every way. I am a high school student, and when I was told we would be watching this movie in class, I was not very enthusiastic, being a guy. After watching part of the movie, I actually came home and finished the rest. A couple of my classmates, also males, admitted they did the same and loved the movie as well. This movie is for any age group, and whether the viewer is a 3 year old girl or a 16 year old boy, they will love it. This is the first movie that has touched me in a long time. It is humorous, action-packed, emotional, and original. The CGI is so realistic and perfect, everything is exactly how one would picture the events as they happen in real life. The characters are witty and funny, all with their own contributions that make the story so great. I cannot describe why, but this movie deeply impacted me. I find clips of the movie popping into my head at random moments, and I think about it repeatedly throughout the day. I have watched it over and over again, never getting tired of it. I really hope that they decide to make a sequel, because this is one of the best movies I have seen, and my peers all agree. I do hope Disney disregards it's tradition of not making sequels for this one, because this was an amazing movie with an incredible, touching story that could have a great continuation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Disney still reigns when it comes to romantic animated features and this one is definitely a keeper for years to come,"Tangled's got everything you'd expect from a fairy tale movie. Obviously you've got the Princess, the dashing Prince-like love interest, the evil motherly figure, the quirky townsfolk and of course, the expansive castle. Originally titled 'Rapunzel', it's based on the classic German fairy tale from the Brothers Grimm of a magically long-maned Princess who's locked in a tower by her wicked, selfish 'mother.' Disney apparently changed the title to be more appealing to boys who might be deterred from seeing a Princess flick. They also argued that Rapunzel isn't the only main character in the film, as Flynn Rider is also featured prominently in the film. Instead of a traditional prince, Rider is a thief on the run who stumbled upon her and inadvertently changed her world forever.Whether or not the title-switch tactic worked, this one was a real winner for Disney. It's grossed more than half a billion dollars worldwide, more than double the cost to make. Yep, 'Tangled' cost $260 million to produce, perhaps a lot of it goes to the 3D rendering, and it shows. The Wiki article mentioned that the filmmakers combined 'the best of both worlds' of CGI technology and traditional hand-drawn animation Disney's famous for and the result is impressive. This is by far one of the most picturesque and colorful animated features I've ever seen and the animation is smooth and seamless. I really was in awe of how gorgeous every scene is, with the night scene of the two main characters on a boat surrounded by lanterns. It was nothing short of magical.This Princess flick has come a long way from the classics as far as the character goes. Rapunzel is a heck of a lot more assertive and strong but never losing her naiveté and vulnerability. She's bubbly and vivacious but not dim-witted. Her interaction with Flynn from the moment they met is endearing right from the start, but it's refreshing to see that she's not immediately swooning over the guy despite he's the first one she's ever met. Flynn is the typical charming bad boy, self-seeking at first but finds his heart over time. Voiced by Mandy Moore and CHUCK's Zachary Levi, it's a lovely combination that's supported by an equally wonderful supporting cast. In fact, the two non-talking animal characters, Maximus the horse and Pascal the little chameleon are such lovable and memorable creatures, while Tony-award-winning Donna Murphy is excellent in the voice role of villainous Mother Gothel.As with any Disney's works, especially when 8-time-Oscar-winner Alan Menken is involved, the music is one of the best part of the movie. All the musical segments are lively and just pleasing to the ear, with 'I See The Light' as my absolute favorite, it was such a lovely duet. The lantern scene when the song appears is my favorite as well, yes it's on the schmaltzy side but you'd be hard pressed to deny its charm.Tangled's plot reminds me a bit of 'Little Mermaid' (a girl longing for freedom and Pascal is like the new Sebastian) and part of 'Sleeping Beauty' (she's separated from her parents all her life), but yet it's still a pretty unique story that kept me laughing and crying throughout. I also like the fact that Disney keeps this one pretty clean and wholesome, as a lot of animated features these days are filled with crude jokes and inappropriate innuendos. By the end I was totally enamored by this movie and the Blu-ray is now on its way from Amazon :)Disney still reigns when it comes to romantic animated features and this one is definitely a keeper for years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

A Genuine Gem Next to the Fab Four of Disney Animation!,"Right after Disney's acquisition of Pixar and ""Meet the Robinsons"", Walt Disney Animation Studios were on the right track of finding its true identity, under the watchful eyes of Ed Catmull and John Lasseter. First, ""Bolt"" and ""the Princess and the Frog"" became better than ""Meet the Robinsons"", earning high level of critical acclaim. Now WDAS' 50th animated feature, ""Tangled"", is not only the best WDAS film of 2007-2010, but, too, a rare film that gets to rank among films from the Disney Renaissance - mainly, ""the Little Mermaid"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Aladdin"" and ""the Lion King"".If you think I'm talking crazy about Tangled's ranks among the Fab Four, then there are things that you might want and need to notice: finding one's true identity as the main story theme, cleverly executed humor, strong and appealing personalities of the characters, immensely fantastic music and songs, infinitely superb character designs (under the supervision of Disney animator Glen Keane), emotion-stirring moments, and MOST IMPORTANTLY the reinventing of everything in the move. As a big plus, stereoscopic 3-D enhances the humor, the action, the magical moments and the tear-jerking moments of the story, most notably the lanterns in the ""I See the Light"" sequence.There's a special difference between ""the Princess and the Frog"" and ""Tangled"". TPATF emphasizes on elements of Disney tradition (princes and princesses, certain talking animal sidekicks, and toe-tapping songs) over the theme of the story, whereas ""Tangled"" emphasizes on the story's theme over the elements of the film's tradition. That qualifies the film to become an instant animated classic among ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""the Lion King"".I used to be concerned on Tangled's story structure as below the potential of Toy Story 3's story structure, but after a lot of positive reviews and ratings, I now believe that this deserves to have the insurmountable love, much like the Fab Four.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Brilliant, funny, lovely !!","This movie is just brilliant! I'm not going to say anything about the plot or the characters in particular, just that they are perfectly created! They are so easy to like, the dialog is really smart and funny, the songs are very nice and they stick with you even after the movie has ended.It's a movie any age can enjoy because it makes you laugh, feel joy and hope and it makes you smile, but it also keeps you in suspense and wondering what happens next.Like I said before, the dialog is very and I mean very funny, and I recommend everyone to pay attention to the facial expressions of the characters which are simply hilarious!!Ever since I was a kid (I'm 23 now), Beauty and the Beast has been my all time favourite animation movie! It still is but I have to say that Tangled is pretty close in taking its place, and it's definitely the best/funniest/smartest animated movie I've seen in the last 5-10 years!Definitely watch this movie, no matter what your age or gender is, there's no way you won't enjoy it! I'd give it a 20 out of 10 if it were possible!!P.S: As if the story, the dialog and the video weren't enough to make this movie so wonderful, the cast is also perfect!

Family fun,"I sat down to this movie because my daughter almost dragged me along, so wasn't expecting much from it for 2 reasons. 1- CG- everywhere you turn new cartoons are getting done in cg and now 3d. and 2- Disney.

It didn't seem that this was a case of throw thousands of sight gags, one liners and set pieces and see if any stick.Now it's a Disney movie so you know Happy Ever After is pretty much guaranteed, but it's a fun journey to get there!

Return Of Disney Magic,"My first glance of ""Tangled"" I thought it's gonna be an ordinary CGI Disney flick but it turns out to be a magical movie that brings back all the good memories of the old Disney movies. I honestly think ""Tangled"" is more magical than the recent Disney fairy tale movie ""Princess and the Frog"".The new story of Rapunzel is quite clever & the songs recaptures the magic of Disney. I also liked the character development. Rapunzel is curious and adorable while Flynn Rider is an adventurous and some narcissist like attitude. The voice acting was great but the best performance goes to Donna Murphy the voice of Mother Gothel.""Tangled"" is disappointing in the trailers but if you see the movie, you could feel the magic and it brings back the childhood days of Disney. My only problem of this movie the intro and the ending is too quick. But it's fun and entertaining for the whole family. ""Tangled"" will not disappoint you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"refreshingly ""square"" and straight-forward fairy tale","The 50th animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series, ""Tangled"" is a little less flashy and a little less hectic than the average animated feature these days, hewing closer to ""reality"" than most such films – if one can stretch that term to include a tale of a beautiful, tower-dwelling princess whose blonde tresses glow when she sings, and whose ""Prince Charming"" comes in the form of a roguish thief whose face is plastered on wanted posters all over the countryside. But ""Tangled"" doesn't overplay its hand in the storytelling arena. There are no fire-breathing dragons, no talking animals, no over-extended action sequences (or at least no more than necessary). The focus is mainly on two attractive and likable characters coming to know and accept one another throughout the course of their adventures.The adventure begins when Rapunzel (Mandy Moore), who has just turned eighteen, decides she wants to leave the castle in which she's been locked away by an old crone posing as her mother - it turns out Rapunzel's hair confers eternal youth on anyone who touches it - in order to experience what life is like in the outside world. Rapunzel finally gets her wish when the thief, Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) - who's fleeing the law and the two cohorts he's just betrayed - attempts to hide in her tower, which he assumes is empty. However, he gets more than he bargained for when he meets this naïve but feisty young woman who sees him as the opportunity for escape she's been pining for all these years. So off they go to see the world, with many an unexpected adventure awaiting them along the way.""Tangled"" is a little more deliberately paced than the typical kids' flick – indeed it takes a full half-hour before we even get outside the tower room – and the scenes run a little longer than usual, as Rapunzel and Flynn take the time to establish a relationship of mutual respect and trust. The humor is gentle and the tone sweet, yet there is just the right amount of starch in the characters of the crone (nicely voiced by Donna Murphy) and Flynn's aggrieved criminal cohorts to keep things from getting too sappy. The soft-focus backgrounds provide an appropriately comfy setting for the tale, and the musical numbers (by Alan Menken and Glenn Slater) have an appealing Broadway show-tune brassiness to them that lifts the audience's spirits.As written by Dan Fogelman and directed by Nathan Greno and Byron Howard, ""Tangled"" doesn't come sailing out of the wings, as so many similar recent films have done, trying to impress us with its postmodern revisionism and cynical self-awareness. It tweaks some of the elements of the classic Fairy Tale genre to be sure, but it also acknowledges and respects those elements. It really isn't in the business of tearing things down just so it can congratulate itself on its own iconoclasm and irreverence. And I, for one, am tremendously grateful for that.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Fun,"Children's movies tend to have character's that are not very dimensional -- like UP (absenting the first scene which shows how a lifetime of unexpected events often limits our dreams).The best of children's films subtly presents more interesting characters that have more that just 1 set of characteristics. Such a film was Tangled.Rapunzel is astonishing feminine when she cajoles Maximus (the horse) into accepting Flynn Rider as her protector/guide as she makes her way to the festival of the lanterns. She really turns ""it"" on. No guy could resist her combination of innocence and womanliness.My wife made mention of Flynn Rider before anything else. ""Now there is a man,"" was her brief summary of what she liked about the film. He only appeared as superficially very charming to me. Then I saw her point. He does bear a resemblance to Errol Flynn, who was not only charming, but courageous. He treated everything, good and bad, with a basic delight in life.It is the horse that is perhaps the most fun in this film. He had absolutely no dialogue whatever, but he understood everything that was said to him. He had a face that was plastic in origin and conveyed all of his responses with facial expressions. Children's films are masters of speechless communication. The Little Mermaid is almost a perfect example of this genre. So towards the end of her negotiations with him, Maximus lowers his head, flattens his ears and closes his eyes. He knows that his honour as a protector of the realm has been challenged. He knows that she is playing the damsel in distress routine and doing it very well. He knows that she is making a request he cannot refuse. He gives in, but it is certainly against his better judgement. So he shakes hands/hooves with Flynn. He has given his word and he will be obedient to that oath. But he doesn't have to like it.To emphasize the point, he and Flynn exchange shoves and punches on the bridge. They act like a couple of seven year olds. One has to be delighted by such an exchange.The last of the good guys is Pascal, the mood ring with a tail. He is, I think, a chameleon. He too is wordless, but he is not nearly as well developed as Maximus.The men at the inn look like they should be bad guys, but they are not. True, they are capable of drawing swords and maybe using them, but they all have a dream and again it is Rapunzel's innocence that they respond to. Each of them reveals in song what they dream of doing should they be free of their image. They like Rapunzel, but they are not sure of Flynn.The one really ""bad"" guy is Mother Gruthel -- wonderfully voiced by Donna Murphy. She also has the one song that is memorable (Mother Knows Best). She is all oil and false charm and an imitation of motherly love on the outside and all ooze and darkness on the inside. She is a frightening creation.So there's your cast. It's a delightful movie. You don't have to go see this with a kid as your excuse. Just go see it. It's fun for everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Rider is a great character and easily one of the better princes in Disney's history because his down to earth attitude and not like others who act like people girls only dream of. He actually defines the laws of physics for Disney questioning many things that princesses do and no one questions.

Starting off with the characters. Rapunzel is a beautiful and adorable lead; very quirky and funny. Flynn is an equally charming male lead. As far as the villain goes, Gothel is perhaps the strongest villain since Hades in Hercules. She is evil in a completely different way.
The animation is beautiful. There is one scene later on that is just jaw- dropping. Especially on the big screen. The environments are lush and colourful, and the characters are detailed and well animated. The songs are memorable as well.

Classic story with a twist that appeals to kids,"Tangled, Disney's newest Princess fairy tale is based on the classic Rapunzel story. You know, the girl with the long hair, trapped in the tower? Tangled stars Mandy Moore, who has a voice like an angel. She is brave but shy because she's never stepped foot out of her tower. Zachery Levi, as the male lead, Flynn Rider, is no Prince Charming. He's a scamp, even a thief! But that's what makes him interesting.I love all the fabulous new songs by the great Alan Menken, who created the musical magic of ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Enchanted,"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"" along with many other Disney classics. The movie starts with ""When Will My Life Begin,"" a sing-a-long song that really gets you going. It tells how Rapunzel is frightened of the real world but excited to give it a try. The song ""Mother Knows Best"" sets the stage for the horrible tangle Rapunzel finds herself in. She wants to obey her mother, but her heart tells her to follow her dream, even if it leads to trouble.I give this movie five-out-of-five stars, and recommend it for all ages. My Dad didn't think he'd like it, but he was smiling all the way through. (I think he saw a little of himself in that rascal Flynn Rider).

"Subtly clever, timeless classic. Will age well.","Tangled wasn't as big a success as Frozen perhaps because while watchable, it didn't pander to what successful Disney films engage in: Fantasy elitism. Even as the films required some sort of quest for the heroine to achieve (or preferably, a dragon for the hero to slaughter), there's a secret desire for kids to never have to grow up and earn a living. Even in this film, Rapunzel lives a pretty easy life in the tower but there are no parties and friends to marvel at her dresses and singing.What makes this film special is that the villains and heroes, even the rogue, engage in psychology we see in everyday life. The gaslighting performed by the witch should be required viewing for psychology students. The rogue who attempts to dissuade Rapunzel from her quest tries to scare her while it hilariously backfires. It's like the writers were remembering all of their childhoods.That kind of savvy commentary flies over the heads of most kids (and even many adults) but there's plenty of great music, endearing characters, and solid jokes to keep it moving but not perhaps sell as many toys or get girls excited about a life of leisure on a reality show. It's more healthy, but less addictive. The diet-Frosted Flakes of Disney entertainment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A cute animated film from Disney,"I loved this movie. It is the story of Rapunzel, a princess with magic hair that has the ability to heal. Rapunzel was kidnapped as a child by an old woman who wanted to stay young. She kept Rapunzel captive in a tower in the middle of nowhere, where the two of them lived for 18 years. When the old woman would start experiencing the effects of aging, she'd ask Rapunzel to sing a special song while she brushed Rapunzel's hair. Rapunzel had to sing the same song each time to activate her special powers. Every year on Rapunzel's birthday, her parents, the King and Queen, release two lighted lanterns into the sky, hoping that Rapunzel would see them and come home. Eventually everyone in the kingdom began releasing the lanterns, creating a beautiful ""starry"" sky. Rapunzel sees these glowing lights every year and wants to see the display in person. Enter Flynn Rider.Rider, a criminal, stumbles across Rapunzel's tower while on the run. He manages to climb inside the tower. Eventually after Rapunzel is understandably freaked out, she makes a deal with Rider: He must take her to the castle to see the lanterns released, and she will give back his satchel (that she's stolen and hidden) that contains the items he has stolen. Inevitably, the two fall in love and Rapunzel's ""mother"" is upset that Rapunzel is gone and seeks out to find her.This was a great movie with fun characters and fun songs. My favorite part was when Flynn takes Rapunzel on a romantic boat ride so she can view the annual lantern display from the best spot in town. The scene is so gorgeous, accompanied by a romantic song. I'm a sucker for sweet romantic stories, even if they are animated. But none top Shrek.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

This movie is the pinnacle of Disney's Modern Day Fairytales and features loveable characters, beautiful animation, a menacing villain and one of the best romance stories in Disney History.The story is kinda similar to the previous Disney Princess movies but the smart writing makes the story and the world its own while still keeping the magic of Disney's previous Princess movies though some aspects of it can feel a little cliche at times but it's not that big of a problem. Rapunzel is easily one of the most likable, charming and hilarious Disney protagonist. She has this warm energy that makes you fall in love with the character the moment she appears on screen. Flynn Rider aka Eugene Fitzherbert was one of the best parts of the movie. He's funny and cunning but has a soft side which he let's out after he meets Rapunzel. He practically carries the whole film with his perfect comedic timings. Mother Gothel is a great Disney villain. She has all the qualities of the previous Disney villains. She's manipulative, cunning, wicked and a little bit of sassy. Her solo number Mother Knows Best shows how manipulative she is to Rapunzel feeding her with all the lies about the human world. Maximus is great. He's expressions and chemistry with Flynn Rider is really hilarious to watch. Pascal was just there. The romance between Rapunzel and Flynn is electrifying. You really buy their love for each other and I like how this isn't a love at first sight kind of a situation. Their bond grows more and more with each conversation and crazy adventures.The visuals and the animation looked beautiful. The warm colors, the charming locations and the character designs makes this movie feel like a storybook come to life. Even though it looks a little washed out in comparison to some of the more recent Disney Princess films, it still remains charming nonetheless.The music by Alan Menken is good however some songs aren't memorable. ""I See The Light"" is the standout. The vocals, the visuals, the lyrics they all sell it perfectly. ""When Will My Life Begin"" is a lively song that introduces us to Rapunzel. ""Mother Knows Best"" and ""I've Got a Dream"" are good in their own ways but are somewhat forgettable nonetheless.That's my review of Tangled. It's a funny, heartwarming, beautiful, witty and enchanting movie that audiences of all ages can enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

A modern spin on a classic concept results in one of Disneys finest achievments,"Disney and fairytales more or less go hand in hand. And Tangled is no exception to that. However, Tangled does a couple of things different to it's older counterparts, things that in the end results in a fresh, modern and updated version of the classic fairytale trope.Finally we have a Disney princess with a distinct personality and a complex character arc and not just shallow cardboard boxes like Snowhite, Aurora and Cinderella. Finally we don't have a shallow Prince Charming who shows up in the last minute to save the day but a chartacter that starts as an ""antagonist"" and changes himself as the movie goes. Finally we have a villian that has actual motivations for her actions and not just acts evil for evils sake. Finally we have an interesting, complex and intriguing story and not just a simplistic, happily ever after-based concept. Add to that an amazing, colorful and fresh animation and you have a movie that simply is a blast to watch.As a whole, there is a complexity in the characters and in the story of Tangled that makes it more comparable to Beauty And The Beast than to Cinderella or Snowhite, and it is very stimulating to see Disney tackling one of their most classic concepts in that way. The movie feels fresh, polished and shaped in a modern form of movie-making in a way that it's older counterparts doesn't. You can think you want about Snowhite, Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty but for me those movies haven't aged well at all. I consider them to be dated and shaped in a way of movie-making that worked then but not anymore. Those movies haven't stood the test of time for me while Tangled and Beauty And The Beast actually have become better with time. When I show my kids fairytale Disney movies in the future, I most likely will show them Tangled or Beauty And The BeastIn summary, Tangled reinvented the Disney fairytale trope in a way that was necessary for the concept to survive, and thanks to that it became one of Disneys most engaging, intriguing, colorful and cozy movies to date.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

At Last I See The Light: Discovering the Wonderment of Tangled,"""Flower gleam and glow. Let your powers shine. Make the clock reverse..."" so I can re-watch Tangled over and over again! The girl, the guy, the chameleon sidekick, the comical horse, the evil mother - this film has all the essential aspects that make an incredible Disney princess movie. More than that, however, it offers a fresh plot that takes a heartwarming spin on the beloved classic story of Rapunzel. Even if the average princess movie isn't typically your thing, I encourage you to give Tangled a shot. Its humor, music, and genuine characters may just take you by surprise and capture your heart like they did mine.It all starts with a single flower. The king and queen of Corona are expecting a child, but when the child's time comes to be born, the queen falls very ill. The only thing that can save her is a magic golden flower. Our villain, Mother Gothel, has been using the flower's healing powers to keep herself young, but she loses her source of life when the flower is picked and taken to heal the queen. However, the baby girl (Rapunzel) is born with beautiful long, blonde hair that has the magical qualities of the flower. So Gothel steals the baby and takes her to a hidden tower where the evil woman raises Rapunzel as her own, using the girl's hair to preserve her own youth. Every year on Rapunzel's birthday, the kingdom lets up thousands of floating lanterns to remember the lost princess; and every year, the lost princess watches from her tower window and wonders if maybe those lanterns are somehow meant for her.Our heroine, Rapunzel, is the epitome of beauty and delight. Mother Gothel has kept the free spirit of her ""flower"" caged in the tower for her entire life, but with the princess' eighteenth birthday drawing near, the young girl is ready to take that step of rebellion and adventure. A desperate, love-struck, helpless female victim is something that Rapunzel most definitely is not. She is far above her fellow princesses, such as Cinderella and Snow White, and is a positive influence on little and grown up girls alike. She exudes confidence and loving-kindness that inspires one to see the beauty in every person and in every situation. Her beautiful golden hair is an important part of who she is, but that is not where she places her identity. Although Rapunzel is not perfect, her faults give her character a realness and relatability. She learns from her mistakes and continues to fight for the things that matter most. Rapunzel embodies independence, bravery, adventure, passion, and beauty, and she's not too bad with the frying pan either.Enter Flynn Rider: a thief who has stolen the princess' crown from the castle and, in his escape, happens upon Rapunzel's dwelling place. He climbs up the tower, and just when he thinks he is out of danger, he is hit on the head with a loud dong. Rapunzel stands stunned with her frying pan in hand. In a moment of pure childlike wonder, she stares at the unconscious intruder. Despite Mother Gothel's strict orders to never leave the tower, Rapunzel orders charismatic Flynn to take her to see the flying lanterns. Together, they face every kind of adventure from dream-filled drunkards to palace guards to a very stubborn horse, and what starts out as an obligation quickly turns into a caring friendship, and eventually a sweet romance. Flynn guides Rapunzel to discover who she truly is, and she helps him see his worth apart from being a criminal.A believable, powerful, sweet love story in Disney princess movies can prove to be a rare occurrence, but Tangled fulfills this essential quality through Flynn and Rapunzel's romance. Their love comes to fruition in an inexpressibly stunning scene where they are in a boat with the floating lanterns all around them. The magic of the moment is captivating as the lanterns' glittering reflections in the water and their encompassing glow creates a beautiful, magical, and romantic atmosphere. However, a good love story is not without trials. So often, the love story in Disney princess movies is shallow and fails to show the selflessness of love. If you are weary of ""love at first sight"" and desperate female figures being swept off their feet by a rich, handsome prince, then Tangled will surely offer some fresh and enjoyable entertainment. As you will see in the end, their love transcends infatuation and shows that true love requires sacrifice.It would do the film injustice if I did not also mention the incredible soundtrack that enhances this story. You don't have to be sitting on your couch in front of your television to experience the wonderment of this endearing film, for the lyrics and compositions so appropriately capture the emotions of the moments in which they are sung. Not only are they geniusly written, but for me these songs are the centerpiece of so many precious memories. Whether you're dramatically acting them out in the car with friends or screaming them at the top of your lungs in the dish room at camp, the soundtrack isn't just for the film; it's a soundtrack for your life. From the haunting melody of the ""Healing Incantation"" to the joyous and lighthearted ""I've Got A Dream,"" the music will have you leaving with a smile in your heart and a skip in your step.At the end of any great movie, justice is served. The ending must be satisfying yet not too predictable. Tangled checks the box for a fantastic ending. It introduces real life themes of death and loss but also of love and sacrifice. As this journey you've gone on with the characters comes to its climax, your mind is spinning trying to determine how it all will end. When I sat in the theater in 2010 watching the film for the first time as a seven-year-old girl, a gasp rose from the audience as the gripping moment came to fruition. This enthralling end will have you on the edge of your seat with suspense and excitement, but you will ultimately walk away with a genuine sense of joy and satisfaction. The conclusion of this story is not completely perfect and happy, but that makes it real, for in life there is always a price to pay for the things most worth having.Rapunzel's hair and its magical powers seem to be the center of the story. That was why Mother Gothel stole her in the first place and why she was never allowed to leave the tower. In the end, however, it's not about her beautiful magic hair, but about the importance of courage, the steadfastness of a family, and the power of true love. Disney hit the sweet spot with this princess movie. Its heroine, though not without flaws, has a strong, confident, exuberant personality that captures your heart and inspires you to relentlessly chase after your dreams. Rapunzel and Flynn's love story is genuine and believable, a rarity among other Disney princess movies, and the music is music for the soul. Real, raw justice is served that gives you a fulfilled spirit to go out and face the world with courage. The next time you sit down for movie night, I encourage you to give Tangled a chance, for his film isn't just an hour and a half of quality entertainment, it is an endearing story that will leave you changed for the better and for good.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Healthy Relationship?! Disney?!,"If you have experienced abuse, been taken advantage of--this movie speaks to the experience of recovery and breaking free, and provides a template that is authentic and hopeful. Surprisingly so, for a kids movie. I suppose each viewer brings their own baggage to the viewing, but I have always felt being a child is a lot darker and more painful than us adults like to believe. Very few films have room for darkness or represent themes that give children templates for coping with the darkness in a healthy way. So often the films end up telling us if you just get pretty fast (via Cinderella) and wait, someone will save you from the darkness. That power dynamic can create really unhealthy relationships, and I would suggest that many people search for that fantasy, instead of searching for a relationship that is more equal, more giving and taking.This movie offered a surprisingly healthy model of a relationship to kids. Each person was given depth and feeling. Sometimes Rapunzel saved the day, sometimes Flynn, it didn't feel uneven. But what got me was Rapunzel's assertiveness in communicating what she wanted, her confidence in her perspective (innocent and naive as it was). When she put her innocence out there, took the risk, she was given back wonderful things. She is completely in line with her gut. I love the scene in the tavern. By naming her dream and being authentic, she inspired authenticity and emotion in all these tough guys...No game, no pretense, her realness inspired others to be real, and that realness inspired intimacy between her and Flynn. And through that intimacy they fell in love. There are very few children's movies that look at relationships that way.Rapunzel had a lot of baggage (never having left the tower, magic hair, crazy mother). But every time she claimed it, put it out there, it didn't scare Flynn off or cause a meltdown. It added dimension to the way he knew her.I just never see this stuff in kid's movies, and it totally impressed me. So though I have a lot of cynicism towards Disney as a company/corp. I am still able to see this movie and find really important messages in the subtext. Yay! This is NOT Ariel who had to give up her voice to find love, or Aurora who had no personality but great hair. Rapunzel has dimension.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A tangled mess,"Tangled is amateur work when compared against it's goliath predecessors, considering its own goliath $240 million budget. This goes to show no amount of money can buy an animation truly emotive with worthwhile songs and character complexes. Tangled relies more on slap- stick comedy than on story development and intrigue. It uses a timeless formula and executes it predictably to sub-standards. Tangled is a colourful mess, riddled with on-the-nose scenes that have the depth of a placid pool. Animations such as these, although targeted primarily for children, usually showcase their strength by having something for everyone, but Tangled doesn't bother, and will be a forgotten farce of an animation.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

A Princess Movie that will appeal to Every Age Group,"When It comes to Princess Movies, I being a Pragmatist Male Adult, never found too much joy in.

Animated fun from those Disney guys Better than I was expecting!... :),"I thought I'd start my day off with something easy to watch, given a bit of a rough head this morning. Checking what I had recorded, I decided the one that would be easiest on the grey matter was 'Tangled'. I was right I was also delighted with my choice! Nothing like as bad as I was expecting, although it wasn't perfect, Disney have come a long way in the last few years and appear to be on the right track to producing something really great in the next few years. But enough of my nonsense for now More after this very brief summary.Having been kidnapped by Mother Gothel as a baby, Rapunzel is kept away from the world in a hidden tower. The only way in or out is to climb up her long golden hair. It is her magical hair that holds the secret to why Mother Gothel stole Rapunzel away but I'm not going to tell you about that here. Just as Rapunzel is about to turn eighteen, a man, Flynn Rider climbs the tower trying to evade some palace guards who are chasing him. He has stolen something from the palace and they want it back. Each year on her birthday the sky is filled with magical lanterns and Rapunzel wants more than anything to go and see them. But Mother Gothel has made her afraid to go outside. Can she persuade Flynn to take her to see the lanterns and, more importantly, can she overcome her fears of the outside world. I think that's enough to whet your appetite for now don't want the Spoiler Police chasing me down and throwing me in a dungeon again.Beautifully animated with some really great songs (& some not quite so great) to take you along the journey. This is a really well made family film with some really nice touches. The voice talents of Mandy Moore as Rapunzel and Zachary Levi as Flynn Rider were both excellent. I thought Donna Murphy played the evil Mother Gothel very well, particularly the songs. Honourable mentions go to the voice talents of; Ron Perlman as Stabbington Brother, M.C. Gainey as Captain of the Guard, Jeffrey Tambor as Big Nose Thug, Brad Garrett as Hook Hand Thug, Paul F. Tompkins as Short Thug and Richard Kiel as Vlad.The comic relief was supplied by a horse, Maximus and a chameleon, Pascal. There is also a band of thugs who help the unlikely pair on their journey; they have the best musical number in the show (IMO). In fact, this film did have the ring of an old fashioned musical about it and I must admit, I did enjoy that aspect of it. On the down side, I thought everyone looked a little bit too 'Disney cute' for my liking. The eyes way too big and the waistlines way too thin it doesn't look right (to me) I'm afraid. That aside, I did enjoy this film (in 2D) though Recommended.My Score: 7.7/10.IMDb Score: 7.8/10 (based on 60,662 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 89/100 (based on 179 reviews counted at the time of going to press).",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Return to form,"Disney's 50th animated canon feature film - though they cheated by retroactively adding Dinosaur into the list - and in many ways a brilliant comeback for the studio.Tangled, based on the story Rapunzel by Brothers Grimm, feels very familiar if you grew up with the Disney Renaissance films. It's a princess movie, with lots of action, brilliant animation and lots of song numbers. Yet you can definitely see the decade or two that separates it from the Renaissance. Rapunzel is a very different kind of heroine. You can see a lot of Belle and Ariel in her, perhaps even a bit of Mulan, but she is very much a princess for the new century. Very dynamic, very ready with words, very quirky even. The same with our ""prince"", Flynn Rider, who is to Aladdin what Aladdin was to the princes of the 40s and 50s, while still being very kid friendly and accessible. They both have this attitude to them. And while at times it can be a bit heavy-handed, I do admit liking the update. For the most part.I also really like the villain, Mother Gothel. She's what you would get if you took Lady Tremaine from Cinderella, but made her more subtle. She's very clearly an abusive parent, but you're not quite certain if the abuse is intentional or whether she just doesn't know any other way. Her relationship with Rapunzel is one of the more fascinating parent-child dynamics I've yet seen from Disney.And overall it's just a fun film, exactly what you should expect from Disney. It can seem a bit calculated from time to time, especially when it comes to the Dreamworks-esque hipness of the main characters, but it's still a good adventure and solid entertainment all around. Recommended for all fans of Disney and good, solid animation.Though the name of the film should have been Rapunzel! Curse you, overly cautious marketing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Excitement and Amusement for All,"Several of the early Disney feature-length cartoons (""Snow White"", ""Cinderella"", ""Sleeping Beauty"") were based upon European fairy tale, and with ""Tangled"" the Walt Disney Animation Studios returns to this source of inspiration. Their previous animated feature ""The Princess and the Frog"" had also been very loosely based on a Brothers Grimm folk tale, but in that case the action had been transferred from Europe to twentieth-century America. ""Tangled"" is likewise only loosely based upon the original tale, but at least it keeps the traditional European setting.The film was originally titled ""Rapunzel"", after the fairy tale on which it is based, but this was changed to ""Tangled"" shortly before its release. The change, which caused some controversy, was apparently motivated by the studio's concern that their recent animated features, with their stress on the ""Disney Princesses"", had only appealed to girls, and their belief that by shifting the emphasis in the title away from the leading female character they could make the film more attractive to boys. (In a similar fashion Disney's current animation project, based upon Anderson's ""The Snow Queen"" and to be released later this year, has been renamed ""Frozen"").Despite the change of title, the film still keeps the heroine's odd- sounding name (not a normal Christian name even in German and one which I could never pronounce as a child). In this version Rapunzel lives in a secluded tower with a woman named Gothel whom she believes to be her mother. In fact, Rapunzel is the daughter of the king and queen of a nearby kingdom, and Gothel has kidnapped her in order to exploit Rapunzel's ultra-long hair which has magical properties. Gothel has forbidden her supposed ""daughter"" to leave the tower in which she lives, but Rapunzel yearns to explore the wider world which she has never seen, and manages to escape with the help of a young man.I have often thought that the changing appearance of the Disney Princesses sheds an interesting light upon changing attitudes to female beauty. Snow White from the thirties, although she is supposed to be an adult woman, always looks disturbingly adolescent. Cinderella and Aurora from the fifties are both cool blondes, the first with something of the looks of Grace Kelly, the second resembling a blonde Audrey Hepburn. There were to be no princesses in the sixties and seventies, a period when the studio's cartoons were mostly about animals rather than humans, but Ariel from the eighties reverts to the innocent child-woman look popularised by some of the models and actresses of the era, such as Samantha Fox. The princesses of the nineties, the decade of the supermodel, are much more curvaceous and adult-looking, such as Pocahontas and Jasmine in ""Aladdin"". Tiana from ""The Princess and the Frog"", the first black Princess, made her appearance in the year that America's first black President took office. Rapunzel again has something of the adolescent about her, resembling a young Sarah Michelle Gellar, but then she is supposed to be only eighteen. She is, however, something of a feisty, feminist princess, the sort of girl who prefers to take the initiative rather than sit around in the hope of being rescued by a prince.In the Grimm story, Rapunzel is indeed rescued by a prince, but here her love-interest is a handsome young commoner named Flynn Rider. Far from being royal, Flynn- presumably named after Errol- is something of a rogue; when we first meet him he is on the run after stealing the tiara of the ""lost princess"", as Rapunzel has become known after her disappearance. Of course, he later becomes a reformed character; indeed, the human capacity to reform oneself and become something new is a recurrent theme in the film. Rapunzel succeeds in rediscovering her true identity, rejecting the false one which has been forced on her by Gothel, and a gang of scary-looking thugs all turn out to be rather gentler than their appearance might suggest. They also have some surprising ambitions, which Rapunzel encourages them to pursue.Disney villainesses are generally portrayed either as ugly (Cinderella's stepsisters) or as scary-looking (the Wicked Queen in ""Snow White"" or the Wicked Fairy in ""Sleeping Beauty""), but Gothel, a pretty thirty- something, is much more normal-looking, although her brunette colouring and sharper features indicate that, contrary to what she might claim, there is no blood relationship between her and the blonde, sweet-faced Rapunzel. Gothel, in fact, despite her villainy, is generally presented as a comic figure, a neurotically and ludicrously over-protective mother, rather than a figure of pure evil. (Gothel also gets to sing the film's most memorable song, ""Mother Knows Best"").The other character that stands out is Maximus, the horse belonging to the captain of the Royal Guards and an enthusiastic pursuer of evildoers, an animal counterpart to the heroes of all those ""tough cop"" movies. Like most Disney Princesses, Rapunzel has her own animal companion, a pet chameleon named Pascal.My personal preference has always been for the traditional hand-drawn style of animation rather than the computer generated version. ""Tangled"", however, is one of the more visually attractive examples of the latter style, often with a look reminiscent of a painting; apparently the eighteenth-century French artist Jean-Honoré Fragonard was a major influence on the animators. I am not going to award this film a mark out of ten, as children's films need to be judged by different criteria to films for adults, preferably by the children themselves. I can, however, say that ""Tangled"" is a very enjoyable piece of family entertainment, with plenty of excitement and amusement for all.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

There are also conflicts with other not-so- pleasant people (the Horse, and Mother Gothel, of course), but in the end, all that Shrek-like mockery becomes a parody of itself. It does, though, merge very well with romance and all that mi-mi-mi stuff.So, the film is recommended to be seen both to the viewers who like spiteful twists over traditional fairy tales, and to the ones who just like a good bedtime story.

"Very much the usual fairytale/princess thing, but it manages to add a lively turn to proceedings","An enjoyable tale about Rapunzel.'Tangled' kicks off Disney's animated releases for the 2010s in very strong fashion. It's nicely created, with fun characters and a hearty storyline. It actually sets a lot of the foundations that 2013's 'Frozen' uses, there's a fair amount of similarities between the two.Mandy Moore does a terrific job in the lead role, she's brings an energetic edge to the character alongside good humour. Zachary Levi (Flynn) and Donna Murphy (Mother Gothel) are more than decent in their respective parts. You also have the amusing (non-speaking) Maximus.It's still very much the usual fairytale/princess thing, but it manages to add a lively turn to proceedings which keeps it entertaining.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

A film to watch again and again.,"This film is wonderful on many different levels. I encourage anyone seeing this film to explore its back story, for its creation is a result not only of the skill of the Disney team, but of history and circumstance. I will comment on what makes it very good, and then what makes it truly amazing.What makes it very good:1. It's a tight story with plenty of conflict. Rapunzel has much to overcome to reach both her stated and unstated goals.2. A luscious overall look - Inspired by a French painting by Fragonard.3. A beautiful musical score. It's true that you won't remember the songs like you might from ""The Lion King"", but they are still excellent and always pertinent to the story. The underscore is fabulous.4. The direction of Nathan Greno and Byron Howard.5. The casting of characters.6. A satisfying ending.What makes it amazing:1. The blending of 2D and 3D animation, led by the legendary Glen Keane, which leads to...2. Rapunzel. A great movie, like a great book, is about emotions. Through the skill of the animators, we are continually shown the emotions of our blonde protagonist - this is what will lead you to watch the film again and again. In the remarkable campfire sequence, we feel Rapunzel's fear of being judged by Eugene, joy of Eugene's interest in her, protectiveness of her hair, confusion brought about by Gothel's emotional manipulation, fear of judgment once again, despair over not knowing what to do, and finally the irrepressible spirit that is her trademark. All this in just a few minutes of film.I highly recommend this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Bringing on the Magic!,"Tangled is the beginning of what I like to call Disney Resurrection Part 2. After a great decade of films in the 1990's, Disney Animations begun to release lesser quality films....until this film, which is leading the surge of what's to come. This film recaptures the magic of early Disney films and it shows I can renew my faith in Disney. This film is beautifully-animated and has such wonderful songs one can sit back and sing along with.Bryon Howard's film is about a princess named Rapunzel who has special anti-aging powers because of her hair and is kidnapped by an old witch for her powers and is not allowed to leave her tower. But one day, she comes across a thief named Flynn Rider whose paths were destined to cross.The voice-cast is not too bad. Hardly anybody too famous here, but they all do their job quite well. Mandy Moore is the biggest name here and she does a great job as Rapunzel. Zachary Levi brings some wit and charm as Flynn Rider.Overall, Tangled is a great Disney film because it clearly has magic running through its veins. It's beautifully-animated, tells a great story, and it just has you wanting more. It's not the best Disney film, but looking at the films that came a decade before this film, it's a big improvement over those films. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A delightful film for the whole family,"Disney has one of the greatest animation studios around and has fans all around the world. After a long hiatus the studio returned to fairy adaptations. With Tangled they retold the story of Rapunzel and Disney delivered a delightful family film, filled with humour and comedy, brilliant and colourful animation (which is terrific on Blu-ray), action and drama. They is plenty of slapstick reminiscence to the Looney Toons, particularly been the leading male character and the a very determined horse. They are verbal jokes and gags through character interactions. Donna Murphy gave us an interesting villain, someone who is a more subtle and manipulative character on Rapunzel and adds a mother-daughter dynamic. The songs are sadly a little more pop princess and not particularly memorial. The stand out song is 'Mother Knows Best', sounding similar to 'Master of the House' from Les Mis and the visuals match the song well. Good viewing if you want something light-hearted.On minor nitpick I have is that I thought Rapunzel's mouth was too big.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A great example of the Disney formula of success on its best,"As the film starts, so will I start by saying that I really like the frame narrative. Everybody will be able to connect with it because of its reminiscence with bed-time stories, and it neatly ties the beginning and the ending together.Throughout the film, there's a great momentum of action, singing and character building. The film succeeds in portraying likable, believable and funny characters that, although they may be cliché-esque types, do convince. The dialogues too may make you suffer from a certain feeling of déjà-vu, but they are witty, and the songs are enjoyable (props to Mandy Moore), with the usual accompanying trademark funny scenes. The voice-acting is top-notch, as are the sound-effects and the soundtrack, which provides just the right tune for just the right occasion. Going on about aesthetics, the animations were colourful and enchanting with jaw-dropping detail (which makes for an awful lot of beautiful screenshots for fans).The story is no big mystery or surprise, even for those who are not familiar with the fairytale itself. The film however, does a great job of keeping it interesting with several sub-plots and an occasional plot-twist. It is the story about the confrontation between a naive teenager and the world, and also about the adolescent's growing awareness for the other sex. Tangled is a great example of the genius, albeit quite clichéd Disney formula of success on its best. We recognize the story of a sympathetic protagonist searching for freedom, and exploring the world. He or she encounters several evil characters on the journey, but in the end wins out over them, not only because of his or her intelligence and perseverance, but also by charming others with their innocence, likability and lack of prejudice.This mix of elements forms the basis of the trademark Disney formula, with which Disney here proves they utterly ace the art of pleasing a mass audience, all age categories included.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Simply Touch My Heart,"I have a friend who asked me, ""Is thiz movie worth watching?"" I said, ""Go and find out yourself. It is Disney , isn't it?"". Not every year, Disney introduces us to their new Princess. It is going to be a magical time of your life, get ready to be part of the history. Do you remember how wonderful is Snow White, Cinderella, Princess Aurora the Sleeping Beauty, Ariel the Little Mermaid, beautiful Belle and the Beast, Aladdin's Princess Jasmine, Pocahontas, Mulan and last year's Princess Tiana and her Frog""? It is the time! For long-haired Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) to get out from her hidden tower, to leave her ruthless mother Gothel and has some adventures along with her Prince, errr.. I mean runaway bandit, Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi). It is also for the first time, Princess Rapunzel will face unfriendly outside world, but don't worry, she's got her frying pan to protect herself and escorted by a very cool chameleon, Pascal and the white horse with dog's capability, Maximus. The song ""When Will My Life Begin"" reflects that great adventure spirit. The Directors are Nathan Greno and Byron Howard who have ever worked together in dog's tale ""Bolt"" (2008). But I think the person who deserves high appreciation for bringing thiz German fairy tale comes to live is no other than Alan Menken. Menken is the regular Disney's genius Composer who can always provide delightful classic elements into every piece of his magical music or Score. The storyline is so smooth and dynamic. Yeah it is predictable, but at least you could enjoy the joyful comedy, it is always fun to watch how Rapunzel and silly Flynn Rider tease each other. And even though without dialogue, the animal characters which are the chameleon Pascal and the horse Maximus perform successful funny slapstick. For the visual pleasure, the picture is beautifully woven to a higher level, you will be amazed by how realistic each texture and detail it has been made, the hair, the grass bit by bit. The most powerful scene is ""The Floating Lanterns Scene"", when finally Rapunzel and Flynn are in a boat right outside the castle, waiting for the glow flying lanterns to be released. In that romantic moment, you can feel the pure sincerity and so much loves between them through their innocence face expression and breathtaking interaction with the background song ""I See the Light"". That scene simply gives you goosebumps and could easily bring happy tears in your eyes. It is very rare that there is a movie that could touch my heart. Thiz one is definitely the one. Usually if someone asks me, ""Who is your favorite Disney's Princess?"". Most of the times, I would answer, ""Cinderella!"". But after thiz movie, maybe I would give a different answer.

"A good Disney movie.  Not the best, but a lot of fun.","I took my two boys to see this, the older of which was kind of irked at being dragged to a 'princess' movie but I'm happy to report we all enjoyed it. The only reason I'm really writing a review (since its getting enough positive reviews to really cover most of what I liked about it) is to say that there IS a reason to see it besides the 3D effects.I am not a huge fan of 3D films, in fact, it is rare that I don't find it to be a distraction. Frankly I don't WANT to be tricked into believing I'm actually *in* the film unless I'm at an amusement park, perhaps. I like my distance from the goings-on within the picture.We saw this without 3D and the breathtaking scenery was more than enough to feed the senses on its own. Don't feel like you need to shell out the extra 8 bucks for 3D (the upgrade in cost per matinée ticket in my neck of the woods) because its perfectly enjoyable without it.All that being said, it doesn't have quite the clout or likability of the very best Disney when it comes to the songs and pacing, but I would still give this picture a low A, recommend it for family viewing and see it again with a friend if they wanted to. This was far and away better than the Frog Princess, a film which I found terrified my youngest child and bored my older one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Why is it that ""Tangled"" previously called ""Rapunzel"" managed to do a business of $21.6+ million (*figure taken from IMDb*) in such a competitive environment?","Why is it that ""Tangled"" previously called ""Rapunzel"" managed to do a business of $21.6+ million (*figure taken from IMDb*) in such a competitive environment? Most of us had our hopes on the latest epic of Harry Potter series ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows"" which despite having an advantage managed only a $17 million business. There are several reasons why Tangled became an epic piece. Firstly the introduction of Disney's new application of CGI (computer generated imagery) was a major advantage for the movie. This technology actually helped in creating a more powerful and discrete 3D imagery. Previously Disney used hand drawn animation which although was a success in the 80s but failed to fulfill the standards in the movie ""The princess and the Frog"" which was released earlier.Another reason for Tangled being a huge success was the characters it had. The storyline although changed from the original ""Rapunzel"" was much more purified and gained an insight to a much more comedic entertainment. (Mandy Moore) did a great job with her character Rapunzel and so did the rogue Flynn Ryder (Zachary Levi) whom we know from the great comedy serial ""Chuck"". But most importantly the element that made this animation a real success was the direction and the storyline. The movie captured the attention of the audience from the very start and kept on increasing its grasp with a great climax and finally towards the end captured the complete insight of everyone. It's safe to say that although these are old stories but a little molding can be a great success for animated movies in the future.If you want to have fun these holidays and really want to have the best then I recommend watching ""Tangled"" because it's worth it.http://bloggiesinc.com/2010/12/11/tangled-a-huge-success/",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Disney tangled with Pixar,"Since Pixar has taken over creative control over Disney projects, they have gone up. Not only financially but also creatively. And it shows in the outcome of this movie too. While there might be a musical number or two too many in this one, they are still pretty rare. And if you can endure them, you will be treated to a very funny movie. With animals that might not sing (or talk for that matter), but do have a mind of their own nonetheless.And it's the animals that almost outshine the human (drawn) cast. But while the story is predictable, you will find yourself cheering for the all the right reasons (if you are not too pessimistic that is, of course). Or too cynical.

... and Disney does it again!!!,"Quite frankly, when I stepped into the cinema to watch 'Tangled', I didn't know what to expect. But I knew that Disney would have something that would, of course wowed the audience. And they have!!! Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) is a free spirited young girl, with the gift to heal anyone with her magical hair. She wants to be free, since being trapped in a castle by her 'mother' Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy). However, her life turns upside down when a good-looking thief, Flynn Rider (Zachery Levi) stumbles across her castle...An absolutely wonderful cast, Zachery Levi as the ever charming Flynn Rider and the stunning Mandy Moore as Rapunzel, makes the story come alive and exciting! Mandy Moore, best known for playing Jamie Elizabeth Sullivan in 'A Walk to Remember' has portrayed Rapunzel beautifully and I do not think, that anyone could of done it better. Zachery Levi, also has outdone himself by playing Flynn, or should I say Eugene Fitzherbert. Known for playing Chuck Bartowski in 'Chuck' he really adds to the typical 'Casanova' persona, which really really makes him lovable and makes the women swoon.Also the directors, Byron Howard and Nathan Greno couldn't of envisioned and shot 'Tangled' in any better way possible. Everything was done to perfection and Howard and Greno made sure that this film was made for a mass audience, ranging from young to old.So I encourage everyone to take their friends, children and family to watch Disney's 50th venture... a true hit!!

A Nutshell Review: Tangled,"There's some controversy over the name change from Rapunzel to Tangled, but in Singapore we probably got the best of both worlds with Rapunzel - A Tangled Tale, highlighting that this was still in essence, a Rapunzel-Rapunzel-Let-Down-Your-Hair tale. The latest offering to add to Disney's growing list of Princess films, and thought to be the last, this 50th animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series sees the Brothers Grimm's tale being given the Disney update, and that means being more child friendly, thought slapped with a PG rating rather than the usual G.The formula that Disney uses on its chosen princesses from fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm or Hans Christian Anderson amongst others, seem to come with the requisite beautiful singing voice since breaking out into song about their plight and a duet is the norm, and have this aura that birds, butterflies and bees tend to flock to, possessing this power over animals and assisted by a sidekick from the insect or animal kingdom. There's also the Prince Charming equivalent who will gallop over hills and valleys to save his beloved, before living happily ever after expected ending.In all counts, Tangled satisfied the above, though there was a moment in the finale which I thought, since it's touted as the last Princess film (though never say never with box office success) that they would go for the jugular and put a new spin on things, but I guess what's formula shouldn't be tweaked unless it's broke. Mandy Moore the singer plays Rapunzel and so automatically gives the character her singing voice as well, being captured by the evil Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) and imprisoned in a tower (well, very nicely discouraged from getting out to the big bad world out there), though yearning very much to be part of the world seen through her window, much like The Little Mermaid's Ariel. Her chameleon sidekick and palace horse Maximus, though without a voice, are likely to be the more popular Disney animal sidekicks out there with their timely antics, and if there are soft toys of them, I'm quite sure they will do pretty brisk business.But what's slightly different here is that the male lead Flynn Rider (voiced by Zachary Levi) happens to be a rogue in all sense of the word, a thief who has double-crossed the Stabbington Brothers (Ron Perlman) during a joint heist. Not a prince and hardly the gentleman to begin with, his accidental chance upon Rapunzel doesn't result in an instant love connection, but one that developed over time in their journeys to bring her out of her tower, to somewhere close enough to observe a lantern festival that happens on her birthday, where the royalty of the land commemorates the disappearance of the kingdom's princess (no prizes here of course – most of the time one party amongst the lovebirds has got to be of royal blood). I suppose the character's tapered to be slightly more realistic than the swashbuckling hero according to plan.Villains wise, Tangled's Mother Gothel is probably more simple in her motivation to keep Rapunzel's magical hair powers all for herself, an elixir for immortality, though her schemes and execution to do so are more complex and cerebral, preferring mind games and manipulation instead to get her wants, rather than magical powers and potions, being the weak old lady she actually is who's cheapskate enough not to go for botox. With no real powers nor weapons to exercise her threat, she's actually quite weak if it boils down to fisticuffs, inflicting injury from the shadows. The Stabbington Brothers also pose no threat as they are only mean looking and ultimately nothing but posers, and the flick also has in its theme to never judge a book by its cover for the dreamers it made out of a tavern full of thugs.If one were to compare the earlier Disney princesses from what has evolved over the course of time, there's no qualms about the female characters being stronger now than their predecessors. Snow White and Sleeping Beauty had unparalleled rivals in the looks department, but ultimately the docile, demure ladies don't cut it nowadays, especially when they are in comatose in their own films, especially the latter almost throughout. Today's princesses fight against bad authority, and are never flinching if the situation calls for self sacrifice. Alas they still cannot shake off emotional needs of desiring a man in their lives, so not all things are changed for happily ever afters.Still, Rapunzel is that worthy addition to the Disney stable, and I am wondering just how long it'll take before she could be found on the Disneyland grounds. Recommended for its intended demographics definitely, while accompanying adults may find that this is no longer the same as those we all grew up with.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Flynn Rider finds himself hiding away in Rapunzel's tower and they begin great adventures.,"A modern twist on the story of Rapunzel, Disney's Tangled shows the wild, adventurous, and changing life of a teenage girl and her prince on a horse. Although it includes many aspects of a ""princess movie"" Tangled steers away from this classic category and opens up the audience to many besides young girls. The adventures of Rapunzel become much more than a search for prince charming and love. The story becomes a search for happiness, including family, love, adventure, and strength.When Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) finds himself hiding away in Rapunzel's tower and becomes her captive Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) makes a deal with Flynn to take her to see the lights she so greatly wanted to see every year on her birthday in exchange for the crown, which Flynn stole from the kingdom. After Flynn agrees, and a lot of over thinking from Rapunzel, they begin a wild adventure together that can delight and warm the heart of any audience member. The quirky and adventurous Rapunzel will fill the screen with her endurance and strength that only grows throughout the movie.With outstanding cast members, including Levi and Moore, any audience member can be intrigued and pulled into the Tangled fan club. The modern story of Rapunzel can only be made great with the help of great cast members.

I must admit that I did enjoy the 3D animation of this film,particularly Rapunzul's hair. It was very fluid when her hair moved very nice.

Most Inspiring Movie Ever!!!,"Tangled is one of the most inspiring movie of all the Disney's movies I've ever watched. It's also Disney's first CGI movie that got a PG rating (Parental Guidance), because the film contain some violent scenes that can be a little intense and frightening for young children, although the ending is very emotional. I remember when I first watched Tangled in a movie theater with my friend. It was about two months ago on my friend's birthday party, we decided to watch a comedian ghost movie together in cinema. And we we're late to see the movie so, our last option was ""Tangled"". I first expected that it was just some fairytale movie like all of the other Disney's princess movies, but when I watched it for about half an hour,I started to like this movie a lot and it turned out better than I expected, Tangled has it all- lovable characters, fantastic songs and a strong message about how life can change if other people believe in you. It was so emotional and I cried a lot especially the lantern scene and the ending scene. The film was no typical love story at all, it was the best movie throughout Disney's history and I'm so glad I get to watched it, although it was a coincidence.I WOULD highly recommend this movie to every boys, girls, adults and children out there.

One of Disney's best,"Tangled is one of Disney's best films! It is based on old fairy tales but with a slightly modern twist. What's great is that they don't overdo this.

Fun Characters Accompanied by a Good Story and Soundtrack,"Tangled follows a woman named Rapunzel who is raised in a tower all her life but one day meets a man called Flynn Rider whom she recruits to take her outside the tower.Quickly I wanted to appreciate this title. I never really thought about it, but it is pretty clever. After having long hair I can relate to it and sympathize with Rapunzel so much more. If having hair only down to my neck gets tangled, I can't imagine her trouble.The characters are a lot of fun to watch interact with each other or indulge in their own thoughts. Since Rapunzel spends some time alone in the tower, that aspect has to have some focus. She's a super fun character in the movie, and she works really well with Flynn's character, who is also a lot of fun. He's one of the only sane characters in the movie, but he's still kind of insane, so he fit in just fine. These characters were all pretty well-fleshed out and thus, I felt the feels fairly often. In particular I felt tears twice in this movie, even though this was the third time I'd seen it (but the most recent).The comedy works really well. It fits the movie, and is often situational, so it flows really well. While it isn't an incredibly funny movie, it at least doesn't try to force jokes into the story. It takes them as they come. But the humor wasn't the only thing that made me smile. This is such a fun movie, and I found a smile to be very present throughout it.The soundtrack is a lot of fun too. The songs aren't gratuitous or overdone, and often serve the purpose of driving the plot or developing a certain aspect of the story, all the while poking fun at itself, specifically in the form of Flynn Rider's character. Plus Disney just got good voices to sing the songs. Unfortunately, sometimes it was a little too obvious that the character's voice actors weren't always singing the songs, but that was only on one occasion.There was one thing I didn't notice the first couple times I saw this movie, but Disney dares to dip it's foot into the waters of maturity. Without spoilers, it briefly deals with the idea of unhealthy, potentially abusive relationships. It's done mostly through imagery, and isn't blatant, but I definitely noticed it, and I kind of respected it more for that. Plus it just fit the movie as a whole.If I have but one flaw with this movie, it's the method of Rapunzel's big realization at the end. It makes sense, sure, but it's still a little far fetched. As for the ending itself, it's pretty generic in terms of these kinds of movies, but it's still amusing.Overall Tangled is a heartfelt, fun movie. The soundtrack is fun, the characters are fun and engaging, and the movie strikes up genuine feelings. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

I recently watched it again as a 24 year old and it remains perfect.The movie has everything: well written and entertaining characters who develop and grow throughout the movie, action, music, comedy gold, and a beautiful romance.However, the main reason I think the movie holds up so well is because it's actually pretty dark. The villain is conniving and manipulative and the movie deals with themes of emotional abuse in a subtle, but very effective way.I adore this film and will forever recommend it to everyone.

The best Disney film from the last 20 years,"Tangled was a huge part of my childhood growing up. As a blonde little boy, I used to believe I was the male version of Rapunzel and I used to make references to Tangled all the time. Anyway, enough of my childhood, let's discuss about why this film is so awesomeStory- 8/10The story was very strong in the first half. But from the 2nd act and onwards, I felt like the story got progressively weaker and took a predictable route. I would go as far as to say that the feature sometimes felt generic, even cliché at certain points. But the premise is still good, the comedic scenes are hilarious, and the story still manages to be engaging in the later scenes.Animation- 10/10The biggest strength of Tangled has to be the high-quality animation. Everyone has excellent character designs, it gets creative when using its special effects, the character movements are fluid and slick. Not to mention, we go through tons of different environments that are all equally mesmerizing to look at. This is a rare example where the environment genuinely feels like a fairy tale and this is thanks to the amazing animatorsCharacters- 9/10Rapunzel, our main protagonist is someone who's passions are infectious. You can feel her character as if you were there. And every comedic moment with Flynn is automatically comedy gold. Gothel or ""mother"" is a passable main antagonist. She does have a pretty decent villain song and a good motive but I didn't get intimidated by her. The side characters are bland though. Tangled rather has a big cast so not everyone gets to shineMusical numbers- 7/10They were good and catchy. That's the best thing I can say about Tangled's songs, because the musical numbers of Tangled easily gets overshadowed by better ones from other Disney films. But it also could've been worseTones/Themes- 9/10The messages of Tangled are ""Have your freedom and do whatever you want"" or ""You cannot trust everyone"" and these messages were handled and told well throughout the film. Besides this is the type of theme that necessarily doesn't get used much so it has some freshness thereEnjoyability- 8.5/10The first 2 acts were a very good time. With some creative sequences, hilarious moments, and beautiful animation that helps make the film so enjoyable, until the 3rd act. Yeah is it just me or does the climax go on far way too long and concludes in a weirdly generic way. But other than that, this was a very good timeOverall Rating: 8.6/10If you're a fan of Disney, fairytales, or just animated films in general. Then I would highly recommend you to check it out if you haven't already. It isn't perfect but what's done well is done extraordinarily. And I'm happy to give this film the badge of awesomeness.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Nice and detailed characters as well. The animators especially did a good job with Rapunzel.

Tangled has that Disney magic with their fairy-tail,"I saw Tangled yesterday in 3D, and let me just say, I'm glad I did. When I entered the theater and saw a huge line, I immediately noticed that every person in the line was under the age of nine. Now, while I was a little embarrassed, I was still too excited to see the movie to care that much. Tangled's heroine, Rapunzel, is a typical Disney princess.This movie has enough action and comedy to keep boys happy and enough emotion, romance and drama to keep the girls happy. There are a few scenes that made me tear a little, well maybe more than a little. Some scenes have so much emotion and depth that it tugs at your heartstrings, and gives you goosebumps, especially the lantern scenes. Disney is testing the waters of their film making with this one.

"Proto-""Frozen"".","""Rapunzel"" is a central story in ""Grimms' Fairy Tales"" and was one of the most famous princesses without a Disney adaptation-until the studio's animation ventured into the third dimension.

One of the best Disney movies in years.,"This film is a reinterpretation of the traditional Rapunzel tale. Far from being just a children's movie, its a film for the whole family and has space for everything: it has songs, a beautiful novel, a well written script, good action sequences, hilarious moments... Basically, is one of the most positive and innovative Disney films in years.Disney has had serious difficulties in recent years. Difficulties with his rivals (particularly Dreamworks) and some internal problems but, mainly, a kind of existential crisis where the creativity of his team was disappearing and giving us absolutely lamentable films. But this movie was a kind of turnaround, with the studio showing the public that its not yet exhausted. Returning to their own origins, which are the traditional children's tales, Disney artists sought to write a story that appealed to children and adults, and to look at the stories from a more current perspective. Thus, we can find in this film a Rapunzel that is dreamy, imaginative but not naive, shy but full of confidence and personality. After all, if the woman stopped being the weak sex and started to have a strongly active position in our society, why would not that be reflected in children's tales? It was a radical but positive change, which alters our way of seeing the story and allows us to play with it, inserting moments of action or humour.Rapunzel is on the same level as Flynn, a rogue trickster she knows and who will try to help on her trip, and whom she saves in some situations. Mother Gothel is another important character for being the villain. Her characteristics are selfishness and vanity, but she's also somewhat seductive. In certain scenes, the way she seems to use seduction to achieve what she wants is halfway between the lines. Maximus, the guards' horse, has the mannerisms of a rowdy dog ​​and the intelligence of a human being, and can be highly hilarious.The moments of action were well heeled, perfectly mixed with comical scenes without exaggeration. The jokes are intelligent, without falling into the temptation of easy laughter or being a goal in themselves. The animations and designs are excellent, with a graphic that reminds us of some of the films of Disney's golden age. The songs are good, they stay in the ear but they are far from the successes of the past.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Likeable,"That's really the best way to describe this movie. With Disney, you usually get movies that can be described this way. Their films, mostly their animated films, have a good streak of fun, cute, funny, and adventure titles that usually feature great theatrical music, and some rather impressive animation to boot.Most all of this can be said for Tangled, as well as it's an admittedly predictable plot. Yes, we have them all is lost moments and a typical story of someone wanting more out of life. Where this film successes in the chemistry between the two leads. Rapunzel and Flynn are really good together. They bring in plenty of laughs and even some rather touching moments in the end. It is all simple, but there is something in that chemistry for everyone.That's what I liked about it, even more, there is not too much childishness. It all evens out, and I did have a good time with it and would say to give it a watch if you haven't yet.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

I love When Will My Life Begin and I See The Light and I've Got A Dream. I loove Mandy Moore so much and I am so glad that she is a Disney princess. She has both the singing and acting voice for it.

good things to say of Tangled,"I have only good things to say of Tangled, and I believe it's quite easily one of the greatest animated movies to date. The plot is an interesting, unique take on the original Grimm tale (though thank goodness Disney made it age-appropriate) and blends a beautiful mix of fantasy, comedy, romance, horror, and realism together into an original fairytale. The voice actors are well-picked and did an AMAZING job delivering each character's personality and emotions properly. The soundtrack features 4 songs (When Will My Life Begin, Mother Knows Best, I've Got a Dream, I See the Light), all memorable, catchy, diverse and beautiful - as well as orchestral and traditional music. The animation is gorgeous, especially for 2010 and the budget + time this movie had. The color scheme they had for Rapunzel is gorgeous and the palettes for each different scene complement the vibes it gives off so well.The characters are lovable and well-written. Flynn's character is complex (he and Naveen have the most personality out of all Disney princes - ) and his development throughout the course of the movie is commendable - from a selfish thief chasing a daydream, he becomes a man willing to sacrifice his own life so that the one he loves can live hers. Rapunzel is a relatable and good-hearted, creative girl who brings out the best in others and is a literal ray of sunshine, for real though, she's got so much personality - Gothel is one of the best Disney villains, I believe, because she's written so realistically and her manipulation and mind tricks an gaslighting are far more powerful and traumatizing than any spell that can be broken with a true love's kiss. And Max and Pascal will go down as the two of the best animal sidekicks in Disney!I also love the way so many of the little things that often go unnoticed in this movie have such a huge significance/tell us so much about the character. There's an interesting bit of symbolism and imagery going on, and if you try to take this movie apart and analyze it it's quite realistic and interesting in more ways than one.I recommend this movie to any animation/Disney-lover and even to those who aren't quite familiar with the genre - seriously, give it a try, you won't regret it! The age range I think is the movie is best tailored for is probably 9-12 or above. It's fun and enjoyable, with some dark/mature themes older audiences can appreciate.(My favorite scenes - SPOILERS AHEAD! - ranked, are the one where Rapunzel first questions Flynn and his motives - the Snuggly Duckling part, all of it - the almost-drowning underwater and later when Rapunzel heals Flynn's - or should I say Eugene's? - hand, the Kingdom Dance, and the boat scene with I See The Light and the beautiful orchestra music. And of course, the family reunion)Overall, this movie is a masterpiece of modern/animated cinematography and is enjoyable no matter how many times you watch it (trust me, I know). Its jokes and lines are timeless and the whole movie is just - just wonderful (it makes sense why it got a Tangled: Before Ever After, Tangled: the Series/Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure, which is as good - if not better than - the movie, and Tangled Ever After). I love Rapunzel to death, I love Flynn, I love the pub thugs, I love Max and Pascal, I love Queen Arianna and King Frederic, I love the tower (but obviously not when it's being used as a literal prison). And I love Tangled.(sorry this was so long >-<)",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Tangled: A Hair-Raising Adventure,"""Tangled"" is a delightful, charming and visually stunning Disney animated movie that tells the story of Rapunzel, a young girl with magical hair who has been locked away in a tower for most of her life. The film is a retelling of the classic fairytale ""Rapunzel"" and is filled with humor, action and heart.One of the standout features of the film is its animation. The film's use of 3D animation is masterful, with beautiful landscapes, detailed characters and fluid action sequences.

The song ""I See the Light"" is particularly memorable and will leave you humming it long after the movie is over.However, the film is not without its flaws. The villain, Mother Gothel, is not as compelling as she could have been and the film's pacing is a bit uneven at times.

Tangled lets its hair down producing yet another Disney classic.,"I've been avoiding this in an attempt to heighten the minimal amount of masculinity that I've acquired throughout my life. Rapunzel on a pink front cover doesn't convey laddish testosterone. So I reluctantly gave in and watched it...and oh boy I'm glad I did. Disney keep astonishing me with their animations, I really shouldn't be surprised anymore. A reinterpretation of the story of Rapunzel, a princess kidnapped and locked in a tower where an evil woman utilises the power of her hair to remain youthful. A nearby thief encounters the tower and is locked in a promise to guide her to the neighbouring kingdom, against the behest of her ""mother"". Tangled singled handedly put Disney's animation catalogue back on track after many lacklustre titles during the mid 00s. Incredibly easy to see why, this animation had it all. Developed memorable characters brimming with personality and harmonious voices, apparently everyone can sing in this kingdom. Ranging from royalty, thugs and peasants to a determined stallion and an expressive chameleon, this array of colourful characters breathe life into the plot. A fleshed out story dealing with dreams, internal conflict and romance. A witty screenplay boosted by sarcastic dialogue that creates plenty of smiles and laughter. Whether it be the various inaccurate wanted posters of Flynn, ""that smoulder"" or the constant requirement and usefulness of the average frying pan, it's these little details of self-awareness that enhances a basic narrative into the realms of memorability. The animation was absolutely stunning, plenty of fluid motion. The scene involving the lifting of lanterns just floored me. Beautifully crafted. The musical numbers were catchy which is all one needs for a Disney musical. Sure, the plot was predictable and the ending was far too rushed (underwhelming demise of the antagonist) but these shortfalls hardly detract from a entertaining animation that the whole family can enjoy.

About the animation... well sometimes i felt Rapunzel's hair was a ribbon (kinda hard to describe, but it was definitely weird) but other than that it was good (although I myself don't prefer animated movies) So all in all, I felt like a child again some moments were touching others really funny (the bar scene was hilarious) so I'll say this movie felt like a classic Disney movie (and when i say classic i mean the classics from the '90s like aladdin, lion king, so the Disney movies i grew up on)",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
much better than I expected!,"Just got back from a 3D showing of Tangled with 2 10 year old girls.The movie was GREAT! One of the more enjoyable kids films I have seen - it REALLY works for adults as much as kids..and not just girls either.The animation was top notch and VERY effective use of 3D. Much better than Toy Story. The 3D definitely enhanced the film, and there were some scenes that we actually reached out our hands to try to grab something! A first for us! The story seemed a little 'meatier' and mature than some of the other Disney films, while retaining the formula 'spunky girl goes after her dream and nobody is going to stop her.' I really don't want to talk about the plot because I thought it was very well laid out, with a TERRIFIC villainess, and a smart alec -tho-you'll-learn-to-love-him guy and a really likable girl. But it s a very clever take on the Rapunzel story.I was never bored.. I laughed (the humor is REALLY good - so slapstick, but some refreshingly subtle humor too). and yes, I cried (won't tell you why).This may be the most enjoyable Disney film I have seen in a LONG time.There were only 2 things I wished they did differently.1) The songs. They were 'okay' and served the film well, but nothing really stood out. I left the theater and couldn't remember one song. Nothing like ""under the sea"" or ""circle of life"" from the earlier films that stay with you after the credits have long gone by.2) speaking of credits, these were the lamest closing credits I think I have ever seen in a big budget film. There was nothing to keep our interest (and the closing credits were LONG).. No animation.. no clips.. no outtakes.. no surprise scene at the end, etc. Just text scroll. Of course, most people don't include closing credits in their review, but I have seen so many clever credits (remember Lemony Snicket's closing credits?) that after such a cleverly done film, just seeing plain text scroll for 5 minutes was disappointing.. Of course, we were the only ones left in the theater watching the credits so this may mean nothing to most people...Highly recommended for the entire family.9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Rapunzel has been sheltered all her life by her mother, Gothel. Little  does she know how wicked the woman who raised her truly is.","I ADORED this movie. It had all the magic of old classic Disney films, and great changes too. Rapunzel can fight for herself, is an independent strong woman who can fight for herself. Her goal isn't to meet a guy, but to find her family. And she doesn't need Flynn to saver her, she saves herself and Flynn is merely someone who guides her to the town as she has been locked up for 18 years. I loved all the songs, and I loved loved loved everything about this movie, its a family movie and I recommend it to people of all ages ! Disney needs to start producing more films like this. I grew up with Disney princess films so I's be delighted if they made more !!! They were my favorite.

"Oh Disney, you've still got it","All right, finally to the good stuff. Tangled, the latest Disney movie, or should I say the first decent Disney (animated) movie in years. Honestly, when is the last time you saw a decent Disney Animated feature? And yes, I mean Disney, not Pixar. All right, lets back up a minute here. Tangled is the first Disney Fairytale, in years. Originally Tangled was set to be something of an Enchanted-type flick, but the idea was scraped, when the producers realized, uh we're the Disney corporation, we kind of invented the animated fairytale. Which is really eloquent way of saying, that Tangled (bad name by the way, should have stayed Repunzel) is a wonderful throwback to the old days of Disney, the Snow White days, the Cinderella, the Swan Princess days. I felt completely entranced by the story, and excited to see the characters develop. Taking the original Grimm Brothers tale and giving it that classic Disney flavor, that gives the story that light, fluffy taste we all know and love. The fun, funny, free-spirit attitude is just what animation needed and in the end made me really happy, and really, what's a Disney movie without that little twinge of joy? Disney's first CGI Fairytale brought the warmth and sensitivity of their hand-drawn films to CGI was a complete success and a fun, entertaining evening the whole family can enjoy. (Do I actually say things like that?) The real flaw with Tangled, was the marketing campaign, from the commercials it seemed kind of stupid. They should have marketed it as a classic Disney movie, adding in the funny little scenes with Flynn and guitar playing Repunzel. I honestly didn't even know the movie was a musical until the first song. Maybe they were trying to get a wider audience, I don't know, but I'm glad I gave it the chance to surprise me. ++Who knew Zachary Levi could sing?",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Thanks Disney,"I must admit that I enjoy Disney movies. They are always trying to push the envelope and outdo themselves each time they make a movie. You can always expect quality, after all they have been making movies for a long time and should know how to make it work by now. With that said Tangled will be a Disney classic. I was really happy to find a good movie dedicated to what Disney is best at...Princess movies. Rapunzel has never been one of my favorite fairy tales, so I wasn't too sure about this one. Well I'm glad I took a chance. They took the Rapunzel story and really built a great storyline and the characters were definitely likable, as they should be in a Disney movie. I took three 9 year old girls and an 11 year old boy to see this movie. They all enjoyed it, including myself. There is something for everybody. You just can't help but enjoy this new animated classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
An AMAZING movie,"I grew up on Disney. I am a typical Disney child. At the same time, I'm a hardcore traditional 2-dimensional animation type of gal. For a while, I've been of the belief that Disney's 3D movies weren't quite as good or had the soul of their 2D classics. Not to say their 3d movies aren't bad... just not the same. So I went in expecting a good movie, but not something spectacular.Tangled blew me away. It blew right eff out there. I loved this movie. It is my newest favorite Disney movie, and possibly right up there in my top ten favorite movies ever.From the first moment it started, I was drawn in. The first two minutes, I'll admit to crying. Because the storytelling and the gorgeous animation in this movie is soooo amazing. It takes a different and more elaborate twist on the tale of Rapunzel, but in the best of ways. Still, this movie had me crying a good chunk of the time. Especially in the lantern scene, between the king and queen.Now a lot of people say Pascal and Max stole the show, but I disagree. Yes, they were funny, especially with the Max and Flynn interaction. Pascal I honestly didn't care for too much. To me, I viewed them as sidekicks that were... well, sidekicks. They didn't overshadow their heroes.And Gothel. Ah Gothel. I am naturally biased not to like Gothel because she looks eerily like my English professor. Come to think of it... they're both control freaks too... Ehm, but that's digressing, because I despite disliking her, I like Gothel more than my professor. And as far as Disney villains go... I find her to be the most confusing. Yes, at the beginning of the movie, we are presented with her true intentions for Rapunzel but I can't help but wonder if somewhere along the way, she truly did come to love Rapunzel as her own? It's very difficult to say, and I have found myself extremely confused as to whether she is truly really evil or not. I can say, though, that she is highly unpleasant.The ending is also one of my favorite parts... mostly because it concerns my own hair color, and it makes me feel better about myself.My only regret about this movie is that I didn't see it in 3D. For the lantern scene alone, it would be worth it.I don't know how many times I can say it: This is an amazing movie. It is worth your time, it is worth your money, and it... it is truly Disney at its best.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Disney's first CGI musical will have you up for the tangles,"When we think about Disney, we look back on those oldies but goodies hand-drawn animated classics that have good songs and full of heart, but did we ever dream to think that musicals in their movies would be coming back when they began working on CGI? Well no we haven't because for most people, they think the new Disney is dead to them.Recently one year after coming back to the old drawing board for The Princess and the Frog in 2009, Disney continues going back for more computer animation, but there's one slight change; they went back to making a princess movie after Princess Tiana got created, yet they still haven't lost their touch for the musicals we all remember from when we were kids.Not only is Tangled the first CGI musical movie for the holidays, but also the star of the film Rapunzel is the first ever CGI princess in the history of all Disney princess.If you remember the old story tale of Rapunzel, you may know that she is the classical one for having long locks of big hair. Even before Walt Disney's death in the late 1960s, it's no wonder that after so many movies, they didn't have the time to make a movie out of Rapunzel til now.And more than 70 years later, it's happen. Tangled is now Disney's 50th animated feature.Characters such as Flynn Rider and many more (not so much had good names) in the movie Tangled take you on the twisted ways of adventure; something that you will not be catching in most of the other regular Disney princess movies.With it's highest critic and audience ratings, Tangled is the must-watch movie for all Disney goers. And soon should be added to your collection. Do not miss it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Disney's Tangled was quite an enjoyable computer-animated movie in 3-D for my friend and me,"This was the first of two movies I watched with my movie theatre-working friend today (The other one was Faster). The trailers made me wonder if the whole thing was gonna be a little too slapstick for my tastes but having now seen it, I shouldn't have been too worried as it had an equal amount of heart, drama, action, and, yes, laughs. And knowing Disney veteran composer Alan Menken was involved with the songs-with the help of lyricist Glenn Slater-made this film even more enjoyable especially when the number of ""I've Got a Dream"" was performed by a bunch of bar customers that were considered monsters before that. Of the voice actors, I knew ""Chuck""s Zachary Levi was the leading man because of his spots during his show that publicized the movie and about Mandy Moore playing the long-haired princess from some sites but I didn't know about Brad Garrett, Jeffery Tambor, or, best surprise to me, Richard Kiel whom I've long loved for his portrayal of Jaws in both The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker (When I mentioned the last to my friend, he says he doesn't remember those movies or maybe he didn't even see them, I don't know). Anyway, that's a high recommendation for Tangled.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Disney gets its sea legs back,"I can't say enough good things about this movie. It was a visual delight, strong on layered characters, well written, and just when I was considering the idea that the songs weren't as strong as they might be, along came ""I See the Light"" to bring back memories of watching movies from Disney's prime (Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Lion King, etc). Rapunzel is one of the most endearing and believable Disney princesses I've seen and Rider was a comedic, cocky, but well-roundedly vulnerable hero for the story. Mother Gothel was the real standout, a clever, slinky, brilliant villain magnificently acted by Donna Murphy. A strangely realistic portrayal (in many aspects) of manipulation and brainwashing.I've seen it three times and am not finished yet. Wonderful, rewarding movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Disney Stays Relevant in a Feminist World with Tangled,"With Tangled, Disney finally gets with it and recognizes that third-wave feminism is here to stay, forever. The Disney princess has gone from demure, subservient beauty to confident, robust and self realizing beauty. No longer will Rapunzel hide in the corner when an an uninvited intruder scales her tower and climbs through her window. Instead, she repeatedly knocks him unconscious with an iron skillet, locks him in a closet, ties him up with her hair in a chair, interrogation style, and then forces him to agree to a deal. In the process, she directly contradicts her faux mother's deepest fears and warnings about leaving the tower. Nope, this is not your 20th century Disney princess. Its the 21st century Disney princess. This is one tough young woman who sets her own destiny, although not without deep-felt feelings of ambiguity and guilt about disobeying mother's orders (albeit a faux mother who definitely does not have the best interests of the young Rapunzel in mind).For the lesser sex (aka, male homo sapiens), sit up and learn a few lessons. In spite of the string of garbage you have consumed from Pixar for the last 12 or so years, the modern world is not a series of testosterone-laden misadventures. Nope, to compete in this world, you had better learn to value and depend on Rapunzel's golden fleece as Flynn Rider does throughout this movie, particularly during the action sequences. In fact, you are only a secondary player in life.It is fortunate that Disney chose Rapunzel, its 50th animated feature, to stay relevant. This film will likely go down as its greatest triumph, much better than those male-dominated also rans, such as the Lion King or Alladin. The visuals are strikingly gorgeous, perhaps even better than Miyazaki. It uses a rich cadre of characters and formats to present the content, including slapstick, mime, melodrama, Broadway musical, action, occasional Faustian undercurrents, and so forth. It pulls all the right emotional strings, supported by a wonderful musical score. With two great feminist movies in a single year (Rapunzel and Alice in Wonderland), Disney stays relevant, and gets my vote.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Disney at its best,"I found this to be a really first rate production by Disney, and if I'm perfectly honest I feel in my humble opinion its a lot better than frozen. I know that is a brave statement to make considering the success of Disney's latest title but I preferred Tangled for a number of reasons and here's why.First off I really enjoyed the musical numbers in Tangled, ""mother knows best"", ""when will my life begin"", and ""I've got a dream"" got stuck in my head for days afterwards. Frozen has ""let it go"" which i liked, but I can honestly remember any of the other songs, but in Tangled I remember all of them.The story is also really engaging, and I felt that i could feel the plight of each of the main characters, characters that I found myself caring for, truly the sign of a story told well. Visually the film is also very appealing, especially in HD on blu-ray format, and I found it to be bright, vivid and technically accomplished from start to finish.If you haven't seen this movie already, you should go buy it, you wont regret your purchase! - Highly Recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
An Adventure that put the Magic of Disney back in theatres again...,"Better than the Princess and the Frog! Disney did a great job with this film. Yeah, it's still a Fairytale, but honestly with all the other animated films Disney has under it's belt, combined with what Dreamworks is putting out, there aren't a lot of fairy tales left out there.It's a unique creative twist on a well-known bed time story that doesn't exactly put you to sleep. The Characters are spot on, though typical. Flynn Rider, your bad boy stereotype bumps into a perfect princess and shares an adventure laced with romance and plenty of humor.This is a great flick to take the family to and I look forward to seeing what Disney has next in the pipeline.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

My kids aren't yet teens so I can't predict what they would make of it, but I have heard and indeed found myself laughing pretty much all the way through this film. I think although the storyline was predictable in part it was still thoroughly enjoyable. This film might not have some of the best animation that Disney have ever done but I would say its a good all round family movie. I would recommend it to anybody without question.

"Sing out for Tangled, its adorable. As for composer Menken, the man is a rare earth commodity, needs a Nobel made for him","Princess Rapunzel (Mandi Moore) has been locked up in a tower since she was a baby. That's because Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) stole her away from her royal parents shortly after her birth. Why did she do so? Because a magic flower that restores youth was given to the pregnant queen, since she was gravely ill, and Rapunzel's hair now has that magic, with the help of a special song. The young lady's only companions are her ""adopted"" mother and a darling little chameleon, Pascal. However, through the tower's windows, Rapunzel has seen that lanterns are launched on and only on her birthday. A coincidence, maybe? Perhaps. In any case, the Princess wants to go outside the Tower for her 18th birthday present. But, Mother Gothel won't hear of it. She sings a song about the perils of the world, from poison ivy to quicksand, and tells her daughter NEVER to ask such a thing again. Disappointed, Rapunzel tries not to cry. The next day, when MG leaves to gather dinner fixings, Rapunzel is surprised to find a young man, Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) has scaled the Tower's wall to evade the Palace Guards. Flynn, you see, has stolen a crown, and is in trouble. Never having seen a man before, Rapunzel manages to knock him out with a pan and lock him in the closet. Thinking quickly, when Mother returns, the Princess sends MG away on a hunt for white dye, a three day journey. Its Rapunzel's plan to ask Flynn to show her the lanterns and, indeed, the world. It begins well. Mother leaves, Flynn helps the Princess down and the vacation starts. But, all too soon, MG returns, surmises what has happened, and is hot on her daughter's trail. Of course, she is not alone, as more men are chasing Flynn, too. Time after time, the duo is in peril. Will they escape and will Rapunzel learn who she truly is? This outstanding film is so adorable that every viewer will, in turn, sing out its glories to the next potential fan. Moore, Levi, and Murphy are terrific in their important roles and they can warble like the most melodic of birds. The supporting cast is fine, too, as is the animation, script and direction. As for the music, it is so exquisite that a special Nobel prize should be created for Menken, the composer. He is one rare earth commodity and he is ours, an American. (The lyrics are also quite nice). In short, untangle your feet from the couch cushions and go get Tangled at once. What a treasure it is!",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Amazing movie,"I'll have to admit I was surprised with this movie. I wanted to go to the theater and there is not much to watch really apart from Tron,which I obviously seen already, so as I was in denial to go see the fockers, I saw this movie had 8.1 and went for it, not expecting much anyway, just an entertaining movie, being from Disney and all. I was completely blown, the movie is so funny, made me laugh more than The Hangover, but hey,that's just my opinion. The horse and the chameleon steal the movie, they're hilarious. And the story between Rapunzel and Eugene is really sweet, I must say I shed a few tears. The animation itself is amazing, everything is perfectly done and the scene with the lights when they're in the water is stunningly beautiful. My favorite animation movie has always been and will continue to be ""Up"", but this one comes right in the 2nd place for sure. Bottom line, if you want to see a fun, sweet movie, go see Tangled, I really recommend it, you will get out of the theater feeling happy or at least with a warm sensation in your chest, this time Disney succeeded.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Worth seeing. Period.,"As a kid, I grew up watching a good portion of the Disney films. While it does draw on some pop-culture gags that most animated films use now-a-days, it is really a reminiscent of the classic ""fairy tale-musical"" genre that has made the company famous in the first place. Everything in works very well in the animation, the story, and the characters.The only thing that I can think is wrong with this film were the musical numbers. As a 20-year-old male, I've seen my fair share of old fashion musicals, Disney or otherwise. None of them have scared me as much this film's did. It wasn't that they were bad songs and that they slowed the story down, which it didn't, but every time somebody broke into song that it gave me a mixture of terror and humor. Particularly when the thugs started singing. Fortunatly, Flynn Rider and Maximus the horse help balance this fact out.All in all, this is definitely a film that everybody in the family will enjoy one way or another. I'd definitely suggest that you see it, with or without your kids.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Combines classic old-fashioned charm with a modern twist...a true Disney classic...,"TANGLED is much more than ""a drop of golden sun."" It has a flippant, modern attitude in all of the dialog, a crisply appealing and smartly styled animated technique that brings the characters to life, and a pleasant score by Alan Menken that captures the essence of the fairy tale story in street smart style. In short, it's an instant classic for today's movie fans.With talented voice chores performed by ZACHARY LEVI, MANDY MOORE and DONNA MURPHY, the characters are given full-bodied images that are uncannily real. In fact, the chemistry between Flynn Rider (Levi) and Rapunzel (Moore) is a gradual thing (not instant falling in love as in most Disney features), and blends and ripens convincingly for the tender moments that follow.And aside from the key human characters and a horse named Maximus, there's plenty of fast-moving adventure as the evil Mother Gothel plans on keeping Rapunzel at her side forever as a way to retain the magic powers of her golden hair, lest she shrivel away to an old hag. And within the texture of the plot is always a sense of humor from either one-liner wisecracks or the animated expressions of the humans and Maximus, the stubborn horse.Easily one of the best animated features to come out of the Disney studio in some time despite the fact that the score is not as strong as other animated classics. Nevertheless, it has action and romance and an astounding beauty in its magnificent settings and polished art work.Absolutely a must for any animation fan.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
To watch again and again.,"I've been watching Tangled 3 or 4 times now, and I must admit it has become better. At first I weren't that impressed. A couple of years ago when I heard that Disney was going to make a movie about Rapunzel, and that they were going too make more like a traditional Disney, I became very exited. Since I knew that if there were one company that could make a movie about Rapunzel magical, and timeless, it was Disney. I had really high expectations so to say.And then, I watched it and felt severely disappointed. Sadly I cant say why, since that would reveal large parts of the movie plot.But after I have seen this a couple of times, I realize that this is indeed a brilliant movie. The animation is just mind-blowing, there are so many wonderful details. And not to mention that the casting is great.And If this movie had a story that were less predictable, I know it is a fairytale, but too be honest the original fairytale don't have a lot in common with this film, so when they changed the story they could actually have improved it. The story is not bad, It just wasn't what I expected, wanted it to bee, and I was expecting perfection.Except fore that, this is one of Disneys magical movies, and it is worth seeing Again and Again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Disney with Depth,"I know that most Disney movies actually do a fantastic job of making you think, but this is something else.

I found it nearly impossible to find any glitches with this movie, and although I will forever have favorites like The Little Mermaid, or Cinderella, this could still possibly be the best tale of love, royalty, and hope.

Tangled with Rapunzel impressed me as do lovable Disney fantasies.,"I am a big fan of Walt Disney animated movies whether they are cartoons or some Pixar animation. My folks have always encouraged me in my family to appreciate these movies and so they go a long way back in my life.I thought that once again, Disney made some great characters to involve in their shows. The movie and the actors were very lovable with its theme of strong-willed adventure and anticipation as shown by Rapunzel in her quest. I was deeply focused into it while being concerned of what would happen to her and her friend next. Tangled contains smoothly delivered animation and a fine story. It's nice to pretend with an alternate view of what could have happened in the old fairy tale. Also, it played more intensely than some of Disney's happier kids' stories but that could make it stay more memorable to the older viewers. I did feel like I was doing myself a favor by going to see it finally before the movie left the cinema and lo and behold, it turned out to be a winner.To sum it all up, I would recommend this movie to Disney fans and lovers of fairy tales alike. Even though it seemed someway like girls' cartoon ""chick flick"" story line material, having intense mother and daughter interaction between the characters, it really brought pleasant feelings to leave to all levels of movie goers.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
The Vidiot Reviews...,"TangledIf you have extremely long hair and wish to avoid being stared at, simply roll it up into a stylish turban.Unfortunately, it's unlikely that the hirsute princess in this Disney cartoon is supposed to appear Sikh.Blessed with lengthy strains of golden hair that can prolong life, Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) is promptly nabbed by an aging witch.Raised as her captor's daughter, Rapunzel spends 18 years locked in a tower with only her pet chameleon to converse with. That is until, the rakish rogue Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) lands on her doorstep.Blackmailing Flynn into escorting her to the palace, Rapunzel gets her first taste of the outside world, and all its perils.By modernizing the character, her powers, and her purpose, Tangled takes the famed fable beyond its lofty confines, while adhering to standard Disney song and dance.Although, I do hope that Rapunzel's carpet doesn't match her drapes.

"Three words to describe ""Tangled""... Disney is back!!!","About fifteen years ago, give or take, Disney decided to go in a different direction without the audiences really noticing it. It's only after watching ""Tangled"" that you come to your senses and grasp that something had been truly missing all this time.It's like going to your favourite restaurant and ordering your favourite dish that has, over the years, progressively gotten worse. But the changes were so subtle and gradual that you never realized it. Then one day the restaurant goes back to cooking it exactly the way you had it the first time. Suddenly you remember that flavour, that aroma, that delicate complexity which made you fall in love with it in the first place.The increasingly dimming light that had been the Disney ""magic"" is shining brightly once more... with ""Tangled"".The story (No spoilers here): After going through a Disney style makeover, ""Tangled"" is a remake of the classic tale of ""Rapunzel"" containing a balanced yet powerful mix of adventure, humour, emotion, and song. Yes I said ""song"". In many ways ""Tangled"" is a musical. But for those of you who just rolled their eyes in disappointment; worry not. The songs are few and far between, well placed and serve the purpose of adding dramatic effect to the given scene. And they're pretty darn good. Think classic ""Beauty and the Beast"" style though not as catchy as the likes of ""Aladdin"".With a place for everything and everything in its place, ""Tangled"" is very well paced with an engaging story line. And despite the few key departures from the original fairy tale the Disney version is seamlessly woven together by strong characters and ageless dialogue.The Characters: Voiced by the multi-talented Mandy Moore, and with her naïveté, curiosity, lust for life and lack of experience in... anything for that matter, Rapunzel is a Disney princess you instantly fall in love with.As the viewer your heart instantly goes out to her and even though, I hope, not many of us know what it's like to be trapped in a tower by means of psychological abuse, you somehow relate to her and want her to fulfill her dream, trifle as it may be in nature but very important to her given her psychology.Flynn Ryder, the leading man and love interest voiced by Zachary Levi, is very likable and has almost the same screen time and character importance as our princess. Something that, as far as I remember, has not been done before in a Disney feature. Characters like The Beast came close but not quite like Flynn.Other than the brilliantly written and acted character of Rapunzel's mother, who I will not go into as not to spoil the plot, there is also whole spectrum of characters that add colour, companionship and challenges to our heroes' journey.The Age Range: Anybody from a three year old to a hundred will find something to enjoy and love in ""Tangled"".I think anyone over a hundred years old will not get the concept of 3D animation and wonder why the ""people"" in this talkie are so colourful (sorry grandpa just kidding)Final words to Disney: OK, Disney you've had your fun, you've experimented with different directions over the past decade or so, you've gotten it out of your system... Hopefully ""Tangled"" is proof to you that you should stick to what you've always done best musical based, emotion packed, humour filled, classic fairy tales.I hope you continue down this long forgotten path... it works, has always worked and will definitely always work.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

But superhuman strength, can you imagine the possibilities of this?¨ Tangled was a pleasant surprise and it reminded me a lot of the fairy tales I read during my childhood years. This is actually Disney's first CGI fairytale film and it was brought to us from the creators of Bolt and Meet the Robinsons (Nathan Greno and Byron Howard). The movie began a bit slow for my taste, but midway through it picked up and completely hooked me until the very end. There are several scenes which reminded me a lot of Disney's early movies such as Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and The Little Mermaid. The main characters aren't really the stars of the film; it's the secondary characters like Maximus- the horse, and Pascal- the chameleon who steal the show. They were the ones who got the most laughs out of the audience, but Rapunzel and Flynn did make a great couple and were very likable characters nonetheless. There are also a couple of scenes were a small man dressed only in diapers shows up drunk, and he is hilarious every few seconds he appears on screen. Disney took a huge risk at trying to go back to the classical fairytale stories, but it absolutely worked. The story was amazing and had several emotional moments along with very funny scenes that the entire family could enjoy. The CGI effects also gave the story a more magical feeling to it, and the lantern lighting scene was just breathtaking.As for the plot goes we are introduced to Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) who was born with magical healing and aging powers in her hair. The only problem is that if she cuts her hair those powers vanish (which explains why her hair is so long). She was born a princess, but due to her healing powers she was kidnapped by an old lady named Gothel (Donna Murphy), who locked her up in a tower so no one would ever find her. Gothel raises her as her child and Rapunzel grows up believing she is her daughter and thinking that the outside world is a dangerous place. Her only friend is a chameleon named Pascal with whom she spends the entire day locked up in her tower. One day a wanted man named Flynn (Zachary Levi) shows up accidentally in her tower while trying to hide from the castle guards who are searching for him because he has stolen the crown. Rapunzel knocks Flynn down with a frying pan and takes the crown from him. When Flynn wakes up Rapunzel realizes he is not as dangerous as her mother has told her men were, and she decides to make a deal with him. If he takes her to the castle to see the lantern lightings which are released every year on her birthday she will give him the crown back and let him go. Flynn realizes this will be a hard task since he is a wanted man, but it is his only opportunity so he takes it. Together they begin their journey, but the only problem is that everyone is after Flynn, including a guard's horse named Maximus, who is more committed to his mission on catching Flynn than anyone else.I actually watched this movie in Spanish (Rapunzel and Flynn were voiced by Chayanne and Danna Paola) and the translation was really well done as in all Disney films. The story is really well written and has several funny moments along with some emotional ones as well so Tangled is well balanced. The main reason I think this fairytale worked for both genres is that it doesn't only focus on the princess. This time the main characters are both Flynn and Rapunzel and they both get a lot of screen time. Flynn, despite being a thief, is a likable guy and has a good heart, while Rapunzel is the usual innocent girl who is being taken advantage of. As I mentioned before the secondary characters also are one of the main reasons why this film worked so well. Tangled is one of the best animated films of this year (after Toy Story 3 of course) and is well worth your time. I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did and didn't even like the trailer that much, but it really surprised me. I absolutely recommend this film for the entire family. The story is really well written and the dialogue in this film is hilarious.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"A witty, catchy, and beautiful movie that touches my inner child.","I just got home from seeing Tangled, the latest animated fairy Tale from Disney animation.Rapunzel (Voiced with sincere enthusiasm by Mandy Moore) is a girl who has long, long hair that contains the ability to heal, a power she obtained from a flower that saved her mother during pregnancy. For this reason the evil Gothel (Voiced wickedly by Donna Murphy), a woman who had stolen Rapunzel as a baby, keeps her hidden in a tower so that she may use it to keep herself young forever. But when a sly thief named Flynn Rider (Voiced by Zachary Levi) sneaks into the tower, she forces him to take her to see a city where lanterns are sent floating every year on her birthday.The film follows the always classic Disney formula, and the prologue is worrisome, but directors Nathan Greno, Byron Howard and writer Dan Fogelman of 2008's Bolt manage a fine balance between humor, a lot of which was most welcome, divine heart, and wonderful character development. But the real storytelling comes from the brilliant animation. The animation is dazzling, specifically that of every strand of Rapunzel's golden locks of hair, which is simply gorgeous, and the physicality and facial expressions of each character are a great match.The cast clearly have a lot of fun, Mandy Moore's Rapunzel is a sweet, and honest character, Zachary Levi is cleverly funny as Flynn, but the standout is that of Donna Murphy. It's a daring performance, as each time her character manipulates and lies to get her way, it makes the hatred for her rise, but that's the beauty behind it.And of course, I MUST mention the music by the legendary Alan Menken, whose return to the animated musical is very much welcome. The orchestral score may not be one of his very best, but it's a sweetly arranged and brilliantly put together craft. The songs, by he and his lyricist Glenn Slater, are especially great ranging from old fashioned Broadway, to fast paced Honky Tonk, the best of which being the songs ""I See The Light"", taking place during the beautiful lantern sequence, and ""Mother Knows Best"" a catchy tune taking place in the film's first fifteen minutes, and re-prised at a later point in the film.There's something else about Tangled that I love, but just can't explain. Maybe it's the cast, the characters, or even the music, but there's something about Tangled that warms my heart, and touches my nostalgic inner child. It makes me feel like I once did when I was a little kid.So I obviously say go see Tangled, which I give ***1/2 out of ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Psychiatry through fairy tales,"Disney took and reform one of the most knowing fairy tales, Rapunzel. And as Disney always do, is filling all those tales with tons of secret messages, either to hopefully trying to make kids understand some values of life through entertaining or reminding the same old values to us grownups.In my point of view, we have this girl who is coming of age trapped in her ""tower"" of virginity longing to get matured and finally discovers where do these lanterns will might lead her. Rapunzel grew up in the arms of her step mother who is over protecting her and as most mothers is trying to persuade her that the world might change if she decides to leave from the fondling and protection of her childhoods.Examing the step mother, i would say -as i did above- that as all mothers do is trying with all means to keep close to them their precious little child as if it's the only way for them to stay young. What else can a mother feels if not for feeling young again mirroring herself into her growing little girl. Of course, a step mother could have a hole different meaning. It might pictures all the betraying and bad willings of the outside world and all the wrong messages a girl might take when she's coming of age and lusting to discover with her innocence the hole world.Then, we have the chameleon. A small little creature which uses to change its color. I believe that chameleon as it being portrayed in the movie, might represent Rapunzel's mood. We can see through the movie that chameleon has a very powerful role. It's there in every Rapunzel's expressions of feeling and changes its color according to her mood. It's blue when she's trapped and scared. It's green when she has no worries, it's pink when she's feeling that something new is overtaking her.As for her hair...it might stands for her purity. 17 years of purity and innocence which finally loses when she realize that she's in love with a man. All this purity and innocence which used to work as a healing procedure to every person who might feel wrong or troubled. And who is that person that doesn't feel losing all his troubles by the presence of a young, carefree and joyful little child.The lanterns are all her mixed up feelings which she's not ready yet to reveal and for 17 years she's able only just to watch them from distance as if she's afraid or maybe not yet strong enough to examine them. But finally when she's turning 18, being mature now, she leaves fear or questioning behind, and discovers how great it is to understand your feelings in all their expressions.Then we have the falling in love which is followed by betrayal then, the fear of losing a loved one, and finally the power of love which is undefeated. But, allowed me to say, the obvious reference of two persons which their love is also expressed physically. We can see the lighting flower which blooms from (don't misunderstand me) the young man's pubic area. I believe this reference is very clear, the sealing of love by the act of physical love. An act that brings someone back to life.All in all, i always admired Disneys perspective of building or reforming a fairy tale and making it look as ""just an other fairy tale for kids"" but for someone who wants or willing to dig it up he can find innumerable quotes and hide messages. Messages that i suppose are being well hidden into child subconscious and which they finally will find the way to evaluate them when they will come of age.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Three Princesses LOVE it!,"I took my 3 daughters (all Disney Princess fans) to Opening Day of Tangled and all I've heard since is.... let's go again! While we love Princess movies in general in our household, a Princess alone isn't a surefire win (Disney's ""Princess"" made-for-TV was a flop, Barbie is hit and miss, and the Disney Princess Collections are mostly 3/10 stars)...We went with friends (this included three little boys) and all of the children left smiling, laughing, and wanting to see it again.The story is captivating and full of adventure. It was exciting to see a prince with some depth. Many trademark scenes (rowboats and a work song) were included (and as Disney Princess fans, we're glad) - but still Tangled made its own mark.Rapunzel is a princess with integrity, loyalty, and compassion - along with strength, adventure, and charisma.

Long and flowing,"There's a kind of tenderness to behind Tangled that almost works on it's own with out the need for the so called 'post-modern' approach to fairy tales which brings out the cunning above the sentimentality. Tangled works either way. The film trusts it's material an its audience enough to embrace sentimentality, yet there is also a sense of modernity to the film which gives it that much of an edge. This is one of those a movie where the damsel in distress saves the dashing hero. It's cute as a romance, It's effective as part comedy, it feels organic as a musical (capturing Disney's better days). The ending feels a little cheap, but that's typical of fantasies, and I suppose there is no need to get picky. Tangled works, quite well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Disney hasn't let me down!,"Initial thought of the film was that it would be some cheesy, slapstick, 'the film that will ruin Disney' film but i'm glad to say that i was proved wrong. This film captured the heart of what Disney is all about. There were moments of humour, moments of emotion, adventure and it was just great fun! I thought the makers of the film were clever in creating the character of Rapunzel as the original tale shows lack of profile of Rapunzel. So they had to create her as a feisty, likable heroine with character depth to her. Many Moore was great for her speaking role, she can really sing as well. I thought the character of Mother Gothel was interesting as she was superior, elegant yet she was manipulative and evil. She could really sing as well. Flynn's character was not bad, he came out with a few cheesy lines but overall it was great to see his character development in the film. Also with Rapunzel it was clever how they portrayed her emotion of feeling isolated and cut off from society. She wasn't too depressed or reclusive or realistic but she wasn't too happy clappy and showed some emotion of feeling trapped and wanting to break free from the tower. The songs were great as well, defiantly Disney songs. It was just an amazing animation which was fun and enjoyable to watch. Its for everyone to see, for the whole family. Except i wonder why they didn't stick to traditional sel-animation (handdrawn) like they did with ""Princess and the Frog""....i liked the CGI format though, but i think it would have been more special, more ""Disney"" is they stuck to the original format of animation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Best Disney Movie I have ever seen,"I saw this with my daughter on the weekend. Yes, in the past few years I have re watched all the Disney movies with my daughter over and over again. Yes, I don't like almost ALL of them. I liked Princess and the Frog until they turned into frogs. I hate slapstick. I hate funny talking animals. But, when I saw this movie, it was almost perfect. It is up there with the Toy Story's. No talking animals. The slapstick wasn't overly done. The animation was gorgeous. I am an almost 40 year old man, and I can't wait to get this on DVD. And the subtle undertones! Wow! There was plot problems, sure. But it is a kids movie (personally, i would think it would be better for a 8+ year old)",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Continues the studio's trend of excellence set by 2008's Bolt,"With John Lasseter having gained creative control over the studio several years ago now, it's more than fair to say that Walt Disney Animation has become a force to be reckoned with in the industry. While I felt that Meet the Robinsons was a fairly middling entry in the ""classic"" canon, it was 2008's Bolt that proved that it was still capable of creating films on par with those of its sister studio, Pixar. For me personally, it was the film that quickly found its way among Pulp Fiction and The Big Lebowski as one of my all-time favorites. So, when I heard that Tangled (or, as it was initially titled, Rapunzel) would also be under the helm of Byron Howard, along with Nathan Greno, Bolt's head of story, I naturally got pumped. Thankfully, Disney Animation's 50th feature continues the trend of excellence set by the duo's last project.If there's one area where Tangled challenges Pixar, it's in the animation. Much like in the studio's previous computer-animated entry, all of the environments in the movie, while looking incredibly realistic, don't contradict the cartoon-esquire design of the characters. The film also provokes feelings of nostalgia, due in part by the painterly backgrounds that are reminiscent of films from Disney's first Golden Age.As far as the plot is concerned, it's more or less what one would expect. That said, what Disney Animation tends to do best is have characters that are so relatable and different from one another that they make an otherwise traditional, borderline-formulaic tale feel virtually brand new. Definitely, that's pulled off here. The two leads, Rapunzel and Flynn (played with genuine sincerity by Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi, respectively) make for one of the most likable Disney couples, and the two side characters that accompany them along their journey are just as endearing. Often, when going into an animated film in particular, I'm afraid of running into agonizingly annoying ""sidekicks."" However, Rapunzel's pet chameleon, Pascal, got quite a few laughs out of me, and Maximus, the horse of the Head of the Palace Guard, pretty much steals the show. The less said about him, out of fear of spoiling anything, the better.You probably wouldn't know it based on the way that this film was marketed, but Tangled is a musical. While I don't see the soundtrack as a whole going down in history as one of the studio's greatest, there are a couple of truly memorable musical numbers, one of which coming from the film's villainess, Mother Gothel. Voiced excellently by Donna Murphy, she's a character who constantly kept me guessing. If Gothel isn't on par with Keith David's Dr. Facilier from last year's Princess and the Frog, she's close.Despite a mildly slow beginning, Tangled is one of the most entertaining, as well as one of the most emotionally resonant, movies that I've seen this year. Directors Byron Howard and Nathan Greno prove themselves to be more than just one-hit wonders by providing a film with mesmerizing visuals, catchy musical numbers, and a cast of characters that is almost entirely memorable. If nothing else, it's the first film since Inception that's reminded me why I go to films in the first place.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Kudos to Disney for having wonderful breathtaking animation and for having Mandy Moore's voice as Rapunzel.,"TANGLED – CATCH IT ( A ) Tangled is undoubtedly the most charming movie by Disney. It brings the fantastical story of Rapunzel into live again. It's surprising to see that decades have passed by still Disney manages to bring it's beloved stories in totally new enchanting look, which makes them seems like totally new. Tangled is magical blend of humor, music, love and horror. On one side makers have wonderfully achieved bring the magical hairs of Rapunzel into life and on the other side the ending of Tangled is heart wrenching and one of the most daring in Disney movies. Kudos to Disney for having wonderful breathtaking animation and for having Mandy Moore's voice as Rapunzel. Mandy Moore's bring a lot of character to Rapunzel; it was so fascinating to see how she plays with her voice in scenes. Though, on screen we are watching an animation but her voice makes it as believable as any living human. Zachary Levi also did a good job as the thief/hero of Rapunzel. The scenes between him and maximum the White Horse are hilarious. Overall, Tangled is one of the most fascinating and charming animated movie, which takes you into a magical fantastical world.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Disney's finally found a way to make its fairy tales work in the CGI era,"It seems to have taken until the eleventh hour, but Disney has finally found a way to make its classic fairytale stories work in the 21st Century. Thanks to longtime Disney animator Glen Keane (serving as producer) and directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard (""Bolt""), the film stays true to Disney's long line of rich fairytale history while adding a distinct layer of action, adventure and humor that modern audiences now require.2009′s ""The Princess and the Frog"" marked a complete return to traditional animation for Disney and received much praise, but the film continued the trend of moderate and unsatisfactory box-office success for fairy tales. All hope seemed to be pinned on ""Tangled"" to revive the genre or it would surely hit Disney's back burner indefinitely. Once titled ""Rapunzel,"" Disney's strategy for this film was clear: appeal to a wider audience. Zachary Levi's character Flynn Rider, a sharp but self-absorbed thief, became a focal point of the marketing, and while this is Rapunzel's (Mandy Moore) story, he does play a more prominent role than a large segment of Disney princes from over the years. In short, ""Tangled"" appeals to boys, girls and the whole family.Disney has never been known for defying stereotypes, so in that sense, the complexity of Rapunzel and Flynn should be a lauded accomplishment. Like most princesses (or so it seems) Rapunzel is a naive dreamer who sings about longing to see the outside world from her tower, but she's quick with a frying pan (as a weapon, not cooking utensil) and her hair possesses a surprising amount of dexterity. It's rather unrealistic how well she handles the outside world considering her overprotective and narcissistic mother (Donna Murphy) has bred incredible fear in her, but she's by far the most 21st Century princess to date. As for Flynn, despite the cockiness, deception and excessive charm, he has a down-to-earth dry wit too that makes up for his over-the-top nature.The story carries a surprising amount of intensity and emotional pull. With Mother Gothel and the two thug twins in pursuit of Rapunzel and Flynn as they venture to the kingdom so Rapunzel can see the ""floating lights"" that come out every year on her birthday, there's no shying away from dark elements. The possessive mother motif always works to make you sick inside and considering Rapunzel's sweet nature, you really do wish ill on Mother Gothel.In terms of the animation, ""Tangled"" feels traditional, but it's a good thing. Keane has worked on countless of the Disney classics of the '90s and he finds a way to adapt that style while using computers. The result is that familiar richness and magic of a hand-drawn animated film with the photorealism and attention to detail of CGI. With big round eyes, all the characters earn our sympathy quickly and make ""Tangled"" as enchanting as it is action- packed and exciting.As Disney has always done with exceptional skill, the non-verbal but human-like animal characters vastly increase the humor of the film. Paschal the chameleon and Maximus the royal steed both have unpredictable dispositions that make them fun and lovable. As a chameleon, Paschal likes to instigate conflict but quickly recoils and turns the shade of objects around him when he's nervous. Maximus takes it upon himself to track down Flynn with a sense of self-importance, yet he's a sucker for normal animal pleasures like being pet and apples. The brilliance of these characters never fails and will always be part of the Disney legacy.So sigh relief if you're a Disney fairytale fan, because ""Tangled"" has finally found the answer. Some die-hards will insist on more memorable songs and musical numbers (even with a couple of excellent Alan Menken tunes, especially ""I See the Light""), but the trade off (as seen with a ""PG"" rating for the film as opposed to all previous fairy tales earning a ""G"") is something more compelling for all audiences.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Best animated film I've seen since The Lion King.,"What a joyful movie. Generally, I'm not an animated movie fan(especially the CG type) but this is an exception. Filled with witty songs and dialog with stunning vistas and voice acting, ""Tangled"" is not only a film, it's also a metaphor for the many conflicting emotions the characters exhibit in the film such as Rapunzel's desire to see the outside world, to Mother Gothel wanting to shelter her from it(for reasons unknown to her but to the audience) to Flynn wanting to make a name for himself. I was utterly surprised despite being a kid's film, it also touches on some pretty adult subject matter such as ageism, selfishness, desire, and love. That was really unexpected from a film of this type. Although it is loosely based on the legend of Rumplestilskin, Tangled is one of the best animated films of this year.

Finally Disney makes an enjoyable movie again!,"I am one of those people who dreaded every new Disney release after their successful hit in the 90's. It seemed all the movie had gone downhill. Boring and predictable. You just had to look at the cover to know how it ended.This movie is a wonderful surprise. I was very reluctant to watch it, but my friends told me it was funny, so I gave it a chance. And I'm glad I did.The characters have very good personalities and the animation is beautiful and might I even brag it looks flawless? The voices are excellently picked, even though I worried with the choice of Mandy Moore, she fits the character perfectly.And the best part is that this movie is so funny! I was constantly laughing and giggling, especially thanks to that horse. Excellent animation and thanks to the fact the animals are silent made it even more funny. It felt almost like watching an old Donald Duck cartoon. (I find that talking animal sidekicks tend to draw attention away rather than provide good humor)The movie has good morals, a good story and overall it was very easy to relate to Rapunzel. Fun, good pacing and I liked that the male character was more vain than the princess.It only gets an eight because the singing voices were beautiful, but all the songs were forgettable.

It has many plot trademarks of Disney, but the singing helped make it a little more unusual and original. I am amazed by the quality of computer animation these days and thought the movie was visually pleasing. The 3D was tastefully incorporated, too, as there were only a few added falling logs and such.

The Disney 50th is  brilliant,"As always I saw the non 3d, and I easily found cinemas in London showing it non 3d, so this was my next film on my list as Green Hornet is nowhere to be found in London but in sod 3d, guess that is why it is struggling at the box office and Tangled made a load off cash in America, lesson, make film available in 2d with loads of prints (no to so called 3d, full stop.) Tangled as you well know marks Disney Animation's 50 animated film, and the print I saw was beautiful, nice rich colours and dark blacks. This is just a lovely looking film visually and the story is fun and action from start to finish, minimum songs, 3 I think, were used rightly and not too long.Character design for all, but mainly for Rapunzel, her hair deserves praise. The film's colours are akin to Sleeping Beauty with lots of greens and warm reds. Voice cast is perfect, Mandy Moore should do more Disney work after this.I enjoyed this as much as Toy Story 3 and if this is up for an Oscar, I really do want it to win, as I like it more than Toy Story.My only moan is did it really cost $180 million to make??",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Highly enjoyable film that brings back some of Disney's magic,"To be honest I miss the old days of Disney films and computer animation hasn't fully taken me over. Perhaps it is because most of the Disney films I love take rank with Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella, Aladdin, The Lion King and the Little Mermaid to name some. That is not to say I don't enjoy computer animation but there is a certain quality to them in which the humour feels a bit more in your face, which isn't the humour I usually go for.Tangled takes on the old tale of Rapunzel whom I only remember as a girl locked away in a tower with very long hair. I didn't remember much else of the tale as this is not one I'm highly familiar with in details. So I was surprised to find myself enjoying this and it's been a while that I've been to an animated film that has songs in it again. The songs aren't as great or memorable as Disney's old classics, but they are still enjoyable and Disney has brought back its charm, which has been a long time coming.Rapunzel (voiced by pop start turned actress Mandy Moore) is kidnapped at birth by an old woman who longs to have her youth back. It turns out Rapunzel's hair has a magic that will keep her young and if it is cut, will lose its power. The king and queen, unable to find her, cast out sky lanterns every year on her birthday in the hope that one day she will return. On her eighteenth birthday, Rapunzel desperately asks her mother to see the lanterns as her birthday gift, which is flatly refused.Flynn Ryder, who is the leader of a thieving group, steals the tiara of the lost princess and ends up escaping to Rapunzel's tower. After Rapunzel knocks him out with a frying pan, which ends up becoming her weapon of choice throughout the film, she strikes a deal with him. If he can take her to see the lanterns, she will give him back the tiara. Meanwhile, her adopted mother Gothel, who kidnapped her eighteen years ago, tries to get her back home.To change the film title from Rapunzel from Tangled is obviously Disney's cheek at making it seem more humorous because there is a lot of use of Rapunzel's hair. Many escapes from the bad guys involve the use of her hair, whether it be used as a sort of lasso to swing them from one end to another, or being used as a glow in the dark torch while underwater. But hey, this is a Disney film so it's all adorable. Rapunzel is made into a very Americanised girl, but luckily not into a damsel in distress bimbo which would have made her character totally unsympathetic. She is simply a curious girl who has never experienced the world within the four walls she has lived her life in. What is funny about the opening is how casual the introductory voice over is done. Instead of making this a very childlike fairy tale opening, it's almost as though our heartthrob Flynn is taking a humorous approach to the tragic kidnapping of the princess, and for some reason it works probably because you know she will end up being saved later on, just like in other tales such as Sleeping Beauty or Cinderella.There are some very marvellous scenes in this film, one being a boat ride with Flynn and Rapunzel in which all the lanterns are lighted out and lifted into the air around them; it reminded me very much of Airiel and Eric in the Little Mermaid while Sebastian sings the romantic yet humorous 'Kiss the Girl' song. Visually it is just beautiful and amazing to look at. Luckily, the writers bring scenes like this which are moving, and don't get caught up in making too many unnecessary jokes which would have made this more slapstick rather than funny.I will have to say that while I do miss the classic Disney films of the ninety's, Tangled is a welcome gem simply because it brings life to these characters, situations and isn't a girly movie in the sense that the plot isn't about Rapunzel finding a prince; it's about her finding her freedom and exploring the world she has only read about. There is plenty here for guys to like too, with Ryder's daring wit and smooth talking with Rapunzel, they add a lot together than they are without, also add some nicely executed action sequences which makes use of Rapunzel's long hair and you're in for an entertaining ride.The ending, while nice, was a bit too sweet and cliché for me, and considering the cleverness of the film throughout, could have come up with something more cleverer but this is a minor complaint. This is a great film that adults will enjoy as well and is a great comeback for Disney, who have been in the shadows of Pixar's blockbusters. While it may not have that true magic of Disney's original works, it is still a very welcome and entertaining ride nevertheless.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Moving and entertaining,"Tangled goes down as one of Disney's best. It does not quite have the grandeur of movies like the Beauty and the Beast or the Lion King, but that does not mean that it is lesser, just different. The tone is light and yet feels deep. The characters Rapunzel and Flynn are extremely likable. The story is simple but moving. The visuals are great too. And most of all the dialog and the interaction between characters are excellent. The one weakness seems to be the soundtrack. The background music works but the songs are not that great. I feel like this is the only thing that keeps this movie from being truly great. Nonetheless, Tangled is very good and I would recommend it to people of all ages.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
More like this!,"So this movie was the start of a new era of Disney-animation. Their first completely CGI-made animated movie. It was also the second movie (after The Princess and the Frog) that brought back the story of Disney princesses after a long absence. It is 12 years since since Disney made a princess-themed animated feature! I have to say I missed them, it is kind of the trademark of Disney.Tangled is the story of Rapunzel, the lost princess of Corona, and Flynn Rider, a wanted thief that stumbles upon Rapunzel in her tower. They share a journey to the kingdom for the lantern- ceremony that will change their life forever.What makes this such a good movie is because of many things. Firstly, the movie is beautifully made, the CGI, that people were skeptical to, works fantastic, and some of the ""shots"" are simply stunning. The animation has also come to an incredibly impressive level. The story is heart- warming yet simple, in classic Disney style. The cast, first and foremost Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi, does a fantastic job providing voices for the main characters. Moore has such a sweet voice that works perfectly to the cute Rapunzel, and Levi is amazing in terms of expressing his characters feelings only through his voice. The music is great, with ""I see the light"" being the highlight, and Pascal and Maximus are both funny and complementary as sidekicks.I write this in 2014, which means both ""Brave"" and ""Frozen"" have been released. That is two new Disney-princess movies that continue the success of ""Tangled"". People love movies like this, they can be enjoyed by both young and old. I would love to see Disney continue to make these princess-themed movies, and I am sure there are others who feel the same.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Visually flawless 'Tangled' gets nearly everything right.,"Tangled is the latest Disney animation that flawlessly captures the whole ""Disney Princess"" genre from its traditional cell animation in full computer graphics (also shown in stereoscopic 3-D format). In this retelling of the Rapunzel story, Princess Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) is kidnapped from the palace as a baby by Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) and raised as her own due to Rapunzel's magical hair. Rapunzel has since been imprisoned in a tower until her 18th birthday, when she strikes a deal with a bandit named Flynn Ryder (Zachary Levi) to escape and see up close the strange floating lights that she sees every year on her birthday from her tower. Meanwhile, Gothel, a group of bandits, and the King's guards are in hot pursuit.Finally Disney nearly gets everything right. Almost. Visually, this film is right up there with Pixar's workactually, it even manages to surpass in that arena. This is saying A LOT. Still, the real strength of Pixar's work is how each of their films all work as a whole package, hanging on the strength of its storytelling, characterization, and high concept. It is in these last three points that Disney's Tangled comes very close but not quite reach, yet, that's understandable given that it's based on a well-known fairy tale, and let's face it, when it comes to Disney animation, it has certain rules--repetitive ones at that. There's the recurring cute non-speaking sidekick, the music numbers, the evil stepmother, and couple other rules which will become clear when you see it. Their concept and stories are quite similar to each other, but Tangled does make some novel changes that work well quite dramatically and humorously. The characters have a modern edge to them that makes them fun, yet not derivative. The visual jokes are quite sophisticated and the film never overdoes it.The characters all closely mimic the traditional 2-D Disney character style. Rapunzel beautifully shines in this film. Her expressions, the facial structure, the cute nose, the perfect skin tones, and the big eyes look amazingly alive. The movements of her and all the characters here are spot on. They move just like 2-D animation, yet realistically. The action scenes are breath-taking. I could just watch Rapunzel move around and simply be amazed at the artistry. Likewise, Flynn Ryder and Mother Gothel are well-crafted, humorously and carefully animated. However, if there was one character that steals the show every moment that he appears on screen, that would have to be a certain horse named Maximus. Truly, if there's an Oscar for a CG character, he'd win hands down. If I ever meet the guy who animated this character, I'd love to shake his hand.Mandy Moore is flawless as the voice of Rapunzel. I really can't add anything else to say without being redundant. Zachary Levi brings much personality and fun as Flynn Ryder with his expressive voice and perfect timing, which sound strangely like Steve Carell. Yeah, try listening to him with your eyes closed and tell me if you disagree.Now, the film is not without some flaws. The music numbers can be a tad distracting—admittedly, they weren't particularly memorable. The film would have been just fine without them, but they're not bad. Second, there's a rather predicable nature in the way this film follows a common, worn Disney formula—it's hard to elaborate without spoilers. There's also an underlying meanness in this film that Pixar films tend not to have (yet Pixar films manage to be more mature and thought-provoking than many live-action films). This film is here to entertain and in that way, it succeeds. Disney films are meant to make you want to believe in love and magic, not heady subjects like family relations (Finding Nemo, Incredibles, Up), loyalty (Ratatouille), community (Bug's Life), mortality (Toy Story series), and problems of pride (Cars).Whatever flaws one may look for, they are actually quite trivial compared to the rest of this film. There's no doubt that this film is a great technical leap forward in almost every way, successfully duplicating the beauty, creativity, and imagination of its traditional, animated roots. Disney has done it quite marvelously here. Bravo!For more of my reviews, you can also follow me on http://twitter.com/d_art",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Another charming Disney film,"Tangled is as elegant and exciting as old-school Disney features get. It has the music, it has the charm, and it has the helpful nonhuman acting as the protagonist's conscience. It's also gorgeously animated, with a simple plot that hearkens back to the studio's golden age while maintaining the ability to capture the imagination and attention of today's kids (and adults).True fact: this movie was originally supposed to be called ""Rapunzel,"" but execs at Disney figured that wouldn't appeal much to little boys (they'd made a mistake, the thinking went, with an earlier feature, The Princess and the Frog). Thus the title change.So you know the story of Rapunzel, right? Cute lass, trapped up in a tower, had long hair, etc.? Same basic idea here, only Rapunzel is secretly - not a spoiler - the lost princess of the kingdom, spirited away as an infant by an evil crone; seems Rapunzel's hair is not only long but magical as all get out, and the old crone has been able to use the hair - and the girl's song - to retain her youth.Every year on the princess's birthday, the still-mourning kingdom releases hundreds of lanterns into the sky, hoping that somehow their lost child will find her way home. And every year, Rapunzel sees these lanterns and wonders about their source - could they have anything to do with her, since they appear only on her birthday? Enter Flynn Rider (har har), a thief on the run from that very same kingdom for, you know, thieving. Anyway, he runs into Rapunzel, and they make a pact - he takes her to see where the lanterns come from, and she'll return to him the crown that he had just stolen from aforementioned kingdom but she took from him after whacking him on the head with a frying pan. You know, standard Disney fairy-tale stuff.For the most part, the movie is just plain funny. It's about dreams and hopes and how you shouldn't let go of either, even in the face of defeat. And that's a great message, sure. But it helps that Rapunzel and Flynn are aptly cast (respectively, the known Mandy Moore and the unknown Zachery Levi) and that each isn't just a caricature. There's a lot of whimsy to go along with the derring-do, a word that's just not used enough nowadays. (Derring-do, not whimsy.) And yes, it has plenty of heart. It has all the hallmarks of a Disney movie without the debit of latter-day stunt casting. It focuses itself on Rapunzel and Flynn working together to allow the former to realize her dream. Because there are not distinctly comical figures in the movie, the humor simply evolves; it's not forced or distracting. Side note, though - one of the best characters in the film is Maximus the horse; he's at odds with Flynn (trying to capture him, as a horse of the palace) and likes Rapunzel, and he has more personality and expressiveness than most of the humans.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Tangled,"Tangled is a suitable movie for any ages, but I recommend it more to children 5-12 years of age. Though it is a childish and quite predictable story line obviously wrote to suit younger viewers, I never quite found myself bored, and was quite drawn into it. I must admit that the movie picked up more pace when Flynn Rider was introduced, but I find this no means to label him as a more like able character to Rapunzel, because the movie really got going when the two met and were thrown together. I defiantly agree that the bonus characters like Pascal the chameleon who spends most of his time perched on Rapunzel's shoulder and lighting up the movie with his facial expressions, and of course Maximus, a horse who is determined to see Flynn Rider, most wanted, behind bars, are necessary. The songs may not suit all viewers, they most certainly don't let the movie down. Tangled is a breathe of fresh air and reminds me of the classic Disney Princess movies, the only difference is that i find that anyone can happily sit down and enjoy this movie. I defiantly recommend this movie, a great film to sit down and watch with the family, and defiantly a movie you can watch more than once.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Tangled (2010) - Rapunzel, Let Down Your Hair! Flynn Rider, Bring Out the Smolder!","Walt Disney Pictures releases their 50th animated feature film, retelling the classic story of the Rapunzel fairy tale. ""Tangled"" tells the story of a thief named Flynn Rider, and a girl with long and magical hair named Rapunzel. The story involves Rapunzel finally experiencing the outside world for the first time, after her years of being trapped in captive by Mother Gothel, who uses her hair to keep her healthy. Now along the way, besides getting hit with a frying pan and a brave horse named Maximus, the moral to the story is freedom, true love, and bravery. The movie is provided with an amazing script by Dan Fogelman who helped bring a precious childhood memory of those classic Disney flicks, and it was like telling a new fairy tale from the storytelling book. The casting ensemble of Mandy Moore, Zachary Levi, and Donna Murphy was all super excellent, and brought a lot of comedy, drama, and romance. And let's not forget the incredible music provided by Alan Menken, who made the score into a whimsical musical that is really special to enjoy. Some moments made you laugh, some moments made you cry, and the movie made you feel like a kid in your heart. As I said before, the music is wonderful, the characters are brilliant, the love scenes are beautiful, and the finale blends the perfect taste of comedy and drama, as a perfect way to end another Disney storybook tale.

"A Disney classic to rival loin king, mermaid and beast.","The first thing to say about this movie is that it IS Disney. It is clear that it was originally intended to be traditional 2D Disney animation. Sadly since Pixar has been on the scene the 2D animation department has struggled to keep up with their new rebellious little step brother in terms of story and, indeed - success. Rapunzel was never the most exciting fairy tale ever which is why it has taken so long to use it as a basis for a film. Luckily the writers have done a sterling job at making sense of the whole tale, giving a reason for her to be in the tower and a use for having such long hair etc Then it was taken over and the decision was made to make it a CG 3D movie. And I should say, it's about time. Disney have tried in the past with limited success without Pixar showing them the way. Bolt and Meet the Robinsons were both very OK films but struggled to have that special""something"" to make people endear to them. They lacked the ""heart"" of Disney's beloved classics. Tangled takes the tradition of 2D classics and puts them into a nice looking CG 3D package. The result is the best film Disney has done in an age and lays a foundation for a bright new future. Let's now talk about the film. It's musical, very musical with lots of sing songs and dancing. Problem? It wasn't for Beast or Lion King so it's not a problem here. It's funny, sharp witted, warm and scary in equal measures. It has small characters like the chameleon, maximus the horse and the old drunk in the Snuggly Duckling pub that makes you instantly like them as well as the main characters. Rapunzel and Flynn are entertaining and their relationship is as good as Belle and the Beast's in terms of believability. The main bug bear I have with this film is that it may kill 2D features completely. Why would Disney go back if they can now make great films this way? All I know is that Pixar better beware, they are very established now and can run the risk of becoming fomulaic with Disney taking up the slack and moving back out in front again. (CARS 2 and MONSTERS INC 2 suggests that Pixar may be running low on steam). Here's hoping the next one is even half as good... P.S. go watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Interesting Villain, Wonderful Movie","What I love about this movie is actually the villain. While many villains are pretty cut and dry evil, I don't believe this applies to Mother Gothel. Yes, she is selfish and kidnapping the Princess automatically sends her into the bad person category, yet it isn't all bad. She raises Rapunzel in a nice and cheery looking home, she buys her things she enjoys (paints, books, pottery clay, etc.), and shows her some affection (she says she loves her, hugs her). Even her reasons for keeping Rapunzel in the tower are not a complete lie for there would be people that would be after Rapunzel for her gift. Now, I'm not defending Mother Gothel by any means, I just find her interesting. Plus, let's face it, there are worse real mothers in the world!There are other things that make this movie the best that Disney has come out with in ages. The sidekick characters are hilarious and my daughter always laughs at Max's antics. I love the music as well. I even added ""Mother Knows Best"" as one of my ring tones. Overall, this is a fantastic movie that will find itself on the list of Disney classics along with ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Little Mermaid"", ""Cinderella"", and ""Sleeping Beauty"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Review - Tangled,"I loved Disney when I was a kid. After the blue and white Disney logo (which has been changed since then), I would sit back and enjoy adventure, fantasy, castles, romance, sword fights, songs, magic spells, talking animals, and...well, you get the idea! I used to watch and re-watch several of their animated films. I have to admit, even now that I'm no longer a Disney lover, I still have to admit that I still consider many of their old animated films (including the ones I've listed above) to be good. In fact, I've given many of these films either three, three-and-a-half, or four star ratings. Nowadays, the only animated Disney films I've really been interested in have been Pixar films. But I have to admit, I really enjoyed Tangled, which I saw for the first time last week.At the beginning, a queen is gravely ill, but is cured by the powers of a magic flower. Soon afterward, she bears a baby girl, Rapunzel, who actually inherits the magic flower's powers. However, baby Princess Rapunzel is kidnapped in the middle of the night by Mother Gothel, who wants to stay young via the magic healing powers within Rapunzel's hair, so she raises Rapunzel in a tower. Now a teenager, Rapunzel's hair is extremely long, and she has spent her entire life in the tower, and is curious about the outside world. One day, a thief named Flynn Rider, who is on the run, scales the tower and hides inside, and is taken captive by Rapunzel. She hides the tiara he has recently stolen and agrees to give it back only if he takes her to the place where the floating lights appear on her birthday each year. On this journey, she truly discovers the outside world, and, eventually, who she really is.The story isn't original, and it's a bit predictable, but that's not a problem at all. Besides, this is true for many of Disney's animated films. But it's a good story, and Disney takes it and applies unique and memorable elements and charm to it, and some songs too. Disney even draws ideas and elements from some of its previous films. I think it's safe to say that Tangled is a mix of past and present in terms of Disney. It contains a lot of old Disney-type elements, formats, and methods of storytelling among other things, but with the application of modern CGI animation, and some other modern elements.I was expecting this film to be geared more towards kids, but it's actually a good film for anyone. It is very much a family movie. Sure, there are some kid-oriented elements, and some slapstick humor that the kids would enjoy, but there are also things that adults would appreciate; even the more childish elements I just mentioned are not so extreme, and are perfectly enjoyable for adults. The film has a lot of good humor, but it also has a good sense of character, story, depth, and emotion. The characters are not flat, but are actually very good, and so are the relationships between them. The characters are truly lovable, especially Flynn and Rapunzel (and of these two, especially the latter), and offer genuine emotion. Their attitudes and personalities contain both older and modern elements. There are even a couple of hilarious sidekicks - a chameleon named Pascal and a horse named Maximus (my favorite of which was the latter).CGI technology and effects have progressed even further since this film came out, but still, the animation in this film is beautiful. Everything is well designed, and with great detail and scope - the characters, the scenery, Rapunzel's hair...everything. And this animation is not just eye candy - it's used wisely, and it actually works well with the script and helps with the emotion and narrative, like it's supposed to. The film offers some very memorable things (characters, scenes, images, and much more) including a truly unforgettable, visually beautiful, and emotionally powerful scene involving floating lanterns.The voice actors all put on good performances, especially Mandy Moore as Rapunzel. They all really bring their characters to life. The music in this film is good, both the songs and the standard underscore. The songs could have been better, but they are pretty good and perfectly enjoyable as they are, especially ""When Will My Life Begin?"" (sung by Rapunzel about five minutes into the film) and ""I See the Light"" (sung by Rapunzel and Flynn during the lantern scene I mentioned in the last paragraph). I really have to give the filmmakers a major thumbs up for Rapunzel herself. She is very well designed (especially her hair), and is absolutely beautiful. And not only that, she is hot. Her personality and liveliness are very attractive as well, and she really captures the heart. She and Flynn are great together, and their romantic relationship is handled very well - it's not corny, it's actually charming and emotional (and, yes, with bits of humor here and there).The film is good as it is, but it still could have been better. The one criticism I do have is that there are some things about the story and characters, especially in the third act, that I think could have been handled better and given more depth, and should have involved more character complexity. However, despite this, the film works, and it does have a pretty good sense of depth, character, humor, and emotion as it is. It combines and balances all of its elements pretty well. You laugh when you're supposed to, cry when you're supposed to, etc.Overall, Tangled isn't great, but it's good, and, in my opinion, one of the best Disney animated features in years. It's funny, charming, clever, witty, solid, and full of heart and soul, and I'm actually considering buying the DVD.My Rating: ***1/2 (out of****)",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Tangled,"It has been well over 10 years since the Walt Disney Animation Studios branch of Disney has had anything to shout home about as they have struggled to live up to their past successes (Lion King, Aladdin all the way back to Snow White in 1937) and compete with the modern animations of it's sister company Disney Pixar.Tangled is based on the Brothers Grimm story of Rapunzel (the film's title was only changed from Rapunzel shortly prior to its release) who as traditional tales go was locked away in a tower with only her long flowing hair as a chance of rescue. As a baby, Princess Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) is kidnapped by Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) from the palace for her magical healing powers that have been passed onto her. Locked away in a tall tower and believing she's Gothel's daughter, she longs only for one thing- to get out into the world and see the floating lights that appear every year on her birthday.As luck would have it Flynn Ryder (Zachary Levi), a thief, finds his way into her tower when hiding from the palace guard and Rapunzel fearing he is one of the evil monsters her mother has warned her about knocks him out. When he comes to she strikes up a deal that in exchange for him escorting her to see the lights and keep her safe, she will let him go and return his stolen loot.The best thing about this film is the characters and their mannerisms. Gothel is vanity personified with snide remarks aimed at Rapunzel, Ryder the perfect amount of cockiness and all of the token extras play their part well. My two favourite though say absolutely nothing and easily steal the show. Both the chameleon (Rapunzel's best friend) and a guard's horse, Maximus are fantastic. Seeing a horse which acts more like a dog got me going but this was topped by the chameleon who seemed to have an expression that summed up the mood perfectly every time. A little legend! In terms of graphics, they are some of the best I have seen in an animation with the detail in her hair in particular being most impressive. But then this should be expected as Tangled does now hold the record for most expensive animation and second most expensive film ever made coming in at a noteworthy £157.5 ($260) million.As with all Disney, there was a couple of sing-a-longs thrown in for good measure and although they will not live long into the memory in the way that others have, (hakuna matata anyone?) they were still catchy and you will find yourself tapping along or humming a tune or two for a while after the movie has finished.This movie got me laughing and even having watched it a second time I was still giggling away throughout. It works for both adults and children and the witty way in which it was written appealed to me greatly. I will happily be watching this again so it has most definitely worked its Disney magic on me.

Back to the Core of Fairy tales,"Unlike many fairytale animations of today, Tangled manages to go back to the deep roots of fairy tales. The mother-daughter relationship between Rapunzel and the witch, and the naiveté of the Rapunzel during her years in the tower is dark and eerie in rudimentary levels. Unlike bogeys, monsters and exaggerated evils, it touches to an inexpressible cord inside us. But that darkness doesn't make you feel depressed as well, as the goodness (even in Gothel to some extent), the sunshine of the tower's pretty dweller and her positive spirit reflected on the life and decoration of the tower balances it.Fairy tales indeed touch to the very deep cores of humanity, family relations, the boundaries of childhood, pain of growing up, the good and evil.. that's why they survived for centuries. Tangled is more successful in delivering the true soul of a fairytale than many animated adaptations, especially in the first part.The tower and its hidden small valley is quite atmospheric; and all the other settings are well designed. They deliver the feeling of a fairytale and an ageless style well. Rapunzel is a very likable heroine. The film also has a fun but forgettable bunch of side characters like a horse with exceptional mimics and a surprising Eros.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

A tale as beautiful as her hair.,"Some of Disney's greatest films are retellings of classic fairy tales. Tangled is the perfect example of this. Mandy Moore is wonderful as Rapunzel, bringing happiness and joy to even the deepest cockles of my heart. Flynn Ryder and the ruffians were also excellently cast, though I do wish the palace soldiers would've been given a musical number.I wasn't that big a fan of Mother or her casting, but I do see how her character kinda had to be the least liked. Also, Max's personality greatly reminded me of Altivo from ""The Road To El Dorado."" I would love to see a short film with the two of them.The only real caveat I have with this movie is the significant age gap between Rapunzel and Flynn, but it's something I can live with.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A modern princess story,"This movie was more interesting than any Disney movies I have ever seen. This story is what is called ""princess story"", but every characters were modern and speaking. This is the reason why I could emphasize with them easily. The heroine, Rapunzel was not only cute but also brave. I think she was the first princess who fought bravely! I have a great regard for her. The hero, Flynn was narcissistic, which is rather unusual for Disney movies' heroes. At first, he cared about only himself, but gradually became a genuine hero like other Disney heroes. Yes, this is his most attractive feature! The 3D was also wonderful. Every thing which came on to this movie was no more than an apology for being right in front of my eyes. ""Tangled"" put the memory which I dreamed to be a princess into my mind. It must be liked by men and women of all ages!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Animated adaptation of Repunzel both funny and touching,"One thing I've got to say about this movie before anything else: it spares us that post-millennial mentality of mocking any existing story a la Shrek, Robot Chicken, Simpsons, and so many others. It is faithful to the original story, even presenting elements of the original fairy tale that had been rendered obscure over time. It has respect for the source material, knowing it can stand on its own, without gimmickry.It's truly a splendid mix of childhood fantasy, action, adventure, and comedy. It preserves the soul of the fairy tales's moral, by not watering down the scary and ruthless villains in animated movies or grossly overdoing them to the other direction. This gentle yet playfully mischievous rendering of Repunzel is truly the best I've ever seen. The fact the movie makes chose to title it Tangled even though it's a very faithful telling of Rapunzel suggests the intent to have a good laugh with it. And you do get the laughs but there are no shortage of dazzling and intensely emotional moments. The candle-light lantern bags vigil on the anniversary of the princess's disappearance is lyrical, impressive, and moving. It's magnificently presented and this scene is woven with purpose into the plot. Events that happen there serve as a stepping stone for the characters as they move toward the resolution of what is happening.The villain is superior; the wicked ""step mother""/kidnapper is threatening and deliciously evil; you can't wait to see her get her come-uppance. The gallant bad guy turned good guy/romantic interest couldn't have been better; very reminiscent of Aladdin who trail blazed that pattern.Action moves, characters develop, the audience's emotions are touched. A fabulous story; and an expert job of adapting it for animation. Wonderful for kids, and has something for adults too. Recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A retrospective review,"Every once in a while, my children and I revisit movies to see how they've aged. We were happy to say that Tangled still holds its magic superbly. As one reviewer said, Rapunzel is a hero like the 90s Belle, is full of love, life and curiosity. She is also the equal of her friend, Flynn Rider whose types no longer appear in Hollywood as the concept of an equal has been killed off in modern movies (absent in Moana, ridiculed in Smurfs 3, noting these 2 modern movies are from the same writer who, in my view, does not understand empathy or compassion or equality in any way). If you're looking to see how quickly Hollywood has changed, look no further than Tangled. A beautiful story full of heart and lovable characters (including Gunther and his unicorns). It's more than OK to have dreams and to want to know who you are. Watching Tangled again has made me realise how amazing the story actually is. Superb! A modern classic! Worth the rewind!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
