Simply Not That Interesting,"Is this movie terrible? Absolutely notIs this movie great? Absolutely not.I always heard from people that they either HATED or LOVED this movie. And for me it was neither.The audience for this film is served with a classic action movie/comic book. ""The world is in danger! There must be a solution! Although there are bumps between the characters along the way, eventually, we'll solve the problem""The interesting twist is *supposed* to be that instead of classic superheroes, we have bad guys. To that I say ""so what?"". The movie didn't really establish why I should care about much of what was going on on screen—it was all just classic popcorn movie action and sequences that were occasionally broken up by half-attempts at character development.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Suicide Squad Was Overall An Ok Movie,"So basically i still enjoy most of the movie, i still entertained and engaged in the story most of the time, it's just that the climax of the movie just didn't work for me and it was super boring, and after i watch the movie, problems started to come more, from the main villain of the movie that are not that great but it's not terrible either, i wish we've seen it more in the movie, yes, Jared Leto's Joker wasn't particularly good, some couple of slow scene in the first two act not including the third act and climax, but what really makes Suicide Squad still works in a way is because the Suicide Squad themselves, each of the characters works and their performed it good enough in my opinion, and the sort of military people also works which is great, the team's backstory especially Will Smith Deadshot works perfectly, and the soundtrack of the film was great, so overall Suicide Squad was definitely far from perfect and it is fills with problematic stuff but i myself was entertaining most of the film and there is still quite a lot of legit good moments in the film, i'd say the first two act was mostly good, third act was meh, and it just some decisions in it and boring climax plus the rest of the stuff i already mention ruined it, it was overall an ok movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I wish I could say otherwise but I can't lie like that.,A film that utterly lacked any substance. There was promise at the beginning with a great opening introducing us to the anti-heroes which was awesome. And then.... Nothing? Stranded such a talented cast fighting comical looking goons and an anti-climax of a villian. The two stars are for Viola Davis and Margot Robbie who give their roles everything. Every other character is disposable and forgettable. And Jared Leto as the Joker? Lets say no more.,,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An overly hyped film and a very unfortunate disappointment,"Suicide Squad was a disappointment to me. May be I got hooked on the hype or was expecting too much from WB. This movie had a great concept that we saw on the small screen, both TV series and animated. For some reason, those formats did it better than this theatrical release.This movie suffered from all fronts, poor writing which is the number one problem for me. The story was just all over the place with such in coherency, it's visible at every point. Not enough time was spent in developing these characters for their introduction to the big stage. Poor dialogue was another major problem which is just so stupid at some points.But Suicide Squad still could have been saved with the main plot and a great villain. Sadly that too was a major problem. The main plot didn't make sense because the movie itself went in so many directions that none of it could have come together and gel.The villain was a total failure. Nothing about this person was intriguing and just falls so flat. Story and main purpose was so awful for a big summer blockbuster.This movie probably only had about two things going for it. Majority of the casting was great including Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Viola Davis, Jared Leto, and Jai Courtney. Yes Jai Courtney, I'm shocked too. I really think his role should have been expanded. Notable miscast would be Joel Kinnaman and Cara Delevingne. Joel Kinnaman portrayal of Rick Flag was out of touch of what that character should be and for Enchantress, someone, more older with more acting depth should have been chosen over Cara Delevingne.The other thing would be, through and through it's a much better movie than Batman V Superman. I know that's not really helping but still. A weak six stars and a onetime watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Awful,"My god, that was AWFUL. Just random made-for-trailer tiny scenes that add to nothing, have zero depth and don't make up a coherent plot. Wall-to-wall inappropriate songs that come at random times. Boring plot (if you can even call it that), boring and indistinguishable flat characters. Harley Quinn was annoying. Jared Leto did his best as The Joker but had absolutely nothing to work with - he just appears at random times for a few seconds and disappears. There's no depth and no story. If you've seen the trailers, you basically saw all the one-liners and ""money shots"".If all that isn't enough, the last third of the movie is simply unwatchable.I don't think David Ayer is a bad director (I liked HARSH TIMES and FURY), but this is definitely his worst movie yet and I'm pretty sure it's due to massive pressure from the producers.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Snatches Defeat from the Jaws of Victory,"I think the IMDb user rating of 6.5 perfectly encapsulates what to expect. I use the site mainly to calibrate my expectations before watching a blockbuster or decide to invest my time in giving an indie feature a chance.Suicide Squad has such star power and superhero connections that I was going to watch it no matter what the user reviews said (I always disregard critic reviews as they rarely are helpful) and feel like many viewers were going to as well.The movie has cool set pieces, action scenes and fantastic costumes. However, the plot is so muddled and choppy it detracts from the viewing experience. Another weak link is the enemy - no real backstory to draw us in, almost no explanation on what the enemy is building, and almost laughable minions for the ""heroes"" to combat.There are so many cool characters, I think the movie and plot would have been better served if this had been Part I of a series, rather a stand alone movie.I read an article that stated David Ayer only had six weeks to put a script together and it unfortunately it shows. I felt like I was watching a long trailer - cool and fun scenes that were disconnected from each other.I certainly won't say to pass on this, especially comic book fans, but be warned it is a let down. Especially, considering the awesome source material the director had to work with.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
David Ayer brings something new for the DC Cinematic Universe.,"HEY PUDDIN', THE JOKES ON YOU! IS SUICIDE SQUAD AS BAD AS EVERYONE IS MAKING IT OUT TO BE?Villains, come in many different shapes and sizes. Some iconic villains have even stolen the show from the hero, and are capable of winning fans over. After the outcome of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, the U.S. Government is concerned about how they will deal with future threats. Bad – ass babe Amanda Waller, played by Viola Davis (The Help, Prisoners) sees the arrival of Superman as a wake-up call. She uses the fear of Superman's abilities to fight the U.S. Government into letting her unit Task Force X, a group of their worst imprisoned criminals. The intent is to send the team on suicide missions against super-powered threats in exchange for time off their rather lengthy sentences. This film has been receiving some bad reviews, and a lot of negativity. Do I think it's a perfect movie? No, far from it. However, I believe the film has an amazing cast, great soundtrack, it felt like a comic book on the big screen, well acted performances, colorful, it's fun, funny, and it felt like the DC Cinematic Universe is actually starting to connect more naturally. I honestly don't understand all the negative reviews, and hate this film has been receiving. Honestly, I like it a hell of a lot more than Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.Out of all the actors and actresses so far in the DC Cinematic Universe, the cast in Suicide Squad is easily the best. Will Smith, as Deadshot is the most well rounded character, with back-story, character development, and screen time. If anything, I consider this the Will Smith movie a.k.a. Mister July a.k.a. Big Willy Style has his career comeback. I do agree with what some critics and fans are saying though. I believe Will Smith is the main character, because he is the biggest selling point for this movie. Also, at times I believe he was acting like Will Smith instead of the character Deadshot from the comics.Viola Davis completely owns the role of Waller. She really is mean, fearless, intelligent, determined and as Will Smith said to her in the film, gangsta. She dominates everyone she shares a scene with and makes them look ten times as small. I'd love to see her character come back in the future.""YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT THE CRAZY ONES.""Another standout is Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. If you're not familiar with comic books and or the character. You should know that Margot Robbie had a ton of pressure on her taking on this role. If you go to any comic convention, there are literally many women dressed as Harley Quinn (That's why I like those conventions ha-ha). In my opinion, Robbie will satisfy fans, newcomers who may not know the characters, and moviegoers. Robbie manages to capture the spirit of Quinn from the animated series as well as the newer version from the comics while still making the character work for movie audiences.If you talk about Harley Quinn, you also have to talk about Jared Leto as Mister J a.k.a. The Clown Prince of Crime, better known as The Joker! Leto had to face even bigger expectations. I'll admit, when I first saw the picture of Jared Leto as The Joker I wasn't feeling all that strong about it. I literally said, ""He looks like what would happen if Lil Wayne and Marilyn Manson would have a baby together). Nevertheless, after seeing him here, Leto took on the role and I really feel like he delivered. His Joker brings a lot new to the character and is significantly different from the performances of Heath Ledger, Jack Nicholson, and Mark Hamill. In my opinion, this Joker was a mix of various Jokers. Jared Leto's reminded me very much of the Joker from DC Comics The New 52 series Endgame story-line, Batman: The Killing Joke, Ledger, Nicholson, and the novel Joker by Brian Azzarello. Jared Leto is not trying to be Heath Ledger. He is trying to do something different, yet stay true to the character we love (or hate). I actually would love to see Jared Leto come back as The Joker. I heard many of his scenes were cut from the film, and personally, I'd love to see more.So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on the film Suicide Squad. Even though the director David Ayer (screenwriter for Training Day, Director of End of Watch) mentioned he is not the biggest comic book fan, I believe he constructed a well-done comic book movie. It has a good cast, music, and it feels like a comic book movie. I believe this film would have been even better if it were rated R, not trying to be as funny, and kept the tone of the very first trailer we saw. It's not a perfect movie, but I personally enjoyed it. For those who didn't enjoy it. I'm sorry you were all let down, and hopefully you didn't lose all your faith in the DC Cinematic Universe. I believe that Suicide Squad earns a8/10!This review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie.

Who the hell approved this piece of crap?,"Story line: what story line? - Wasted really good characters. Literally just threw them in this big pile of crap. - Should've just made the movie about the joker and harley quinn. Perhaps a cameo by deadshot instead of this 123min waste of time and money. - Joel Kinnaman... why? seriously, who the hell put this guy in the movie? - clichés. clichés everywhere. - the ending was good. because I finally got to go home, watch netflix and forget about this horrible, horrible thing.Please, do not watch this movie at the movie theater. Not even at home. Just make a new movie in your head and pretend that this one does not exist.

Suicide Squad Not Bad A they say,"The movie is definitely Fun to watch! I, along with my friends enjoyed the Humour inserted all though some of the dialogues showed that they tried pushing the humour... I loved Joker, Harley Quinn, Headshot as well as El Diablo! I enjoyed the animated Killer Croc. All though I have had mixed feeling about Enchantress i still was disappointed about the enchantress's Brother being animated. Also pushing deadshot as thinking about his Daughter was definitely not working for me or any of my friends... I am happy about seeing Batman. The movie was of great pace.... the action sequence was fun! I enjoyed so many things. David Ayer definitely made the Dark DC theme very appealing!! The dancing fire in El diablo was so cool!! i definitely Love the movie so did my friends! Its not a super awesome movie, but definitely a treat for the eyes!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"problems, but overall enjoyed it","Y'know I didn't hate this like everyone in the world seems to. The characters were colorful, big. I guess it's a tough task to get them all equal screen time. My suggestion would have been to cut back on the members. Problem solved.It doesn't quite have the fun of the trailer, which can happen when someone not involved with film cuts something that may not represent the film.Harley Quinn obviously a stand out, but the BIG ONE for me, was seeing Batman, albeit briefly. Just enough to tantalize. Wetted my appetite for his solo film which can't come soon enough.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"The potential was big, the waste of it was even bigger","'Suicide Squad' didn't sound so bad in hindsight. The concept was actually pretty interesting and there is a good deal of talent in the cast. Unfortunately what should have been a winner turned out to be a sore loser, even more of a wasted opportunity than 'Batman vs. Superman'.The costume and production design is both brooding and vibrantly colourful. There are two performances that are good. One is the enormously fun but also just as deliciously deranged Margot Robbie, her Harley Quinn being the film's most interesting character. The other is a menacing Viola Davis, proving that even a stony face makes one feel uneasy. El Diablo is also entertaining, and one of the few characters to be used right and feel necessary.However, for me Will Smith didn't work. You don't see him as Deadshot, you see him playing himself in wooden fashion here and plays Deadshot too jovially, something that Deadshot isn't really, that he also had two introductions gives an indication that the writers didn't know how to characterise the character. Enchantress is a pretty lame villain played with all cheese no menace by Cara Delevigne, while Jared Leto's Joker proves pointless and misplaced to the story (other than giving Harley Quinn backstory which wasn't fleshed out enough). Likewise with the Batman of Ben Affleck, while Killer Croc has nothing to do.One of 'Suicide Squad's' biggest failings is its treatment of the characters. Only Harley Quinn is fully fleshed out, while many characters are either given short shrift or either there was no use to them being there, for example what was the point of having Slipknot and then dispatch the character so quickly and cheaply. This is the consequences of having too many characters and a very muddled story that not only feels rushed but also incredibly confused. The script is equally a mess, with forced and very lazily-written jokes.Visually, other than the costume and set design, 'Suicide Squad' doesn't have the redeeming value of looking good. Editing is choppy and the special effects range from average at best but mostly amateurish. The action scenes are very routine and less than thrilling, chemistry is extremely limited and suspense is next to zero. Plus the music is too constant and far too loud that it becomes a nauseating assault on the ears.In conclusion, could have been a fun film but flounders badly due to lame execution that wastes its characters and much of the cast (with only Davis and particularly Robbie standing out). 3/10 Bethany Cox",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Just Too Much,"I remember as a child when Universal decided to take all the monsters (Frankenstein's monster, the Wolf Man, the hunchback, Dracula, etc.) and have them all in the same movie. These were the worst of the series.. This is another case of too many characters, no plot, no substance. I guess it won an award for costuming but the characters demand that they be costumed to be the characters. Don't bother.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Taking cartoon villains and making them flesh and blood one can root for,"It's about 8.5 worth of a movie in my book, for some real good acting and well written roles. That is, some well written roles, had it been true with all the characters in this movie, this would've been a real masterpiece, but all too often it did fall short of the quality performance of Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Joel Kinnaman. there are a few other solid performances which didn't get their characters developed enough to shine like these three, especially Viola Davis who's very good as the perfect government agent that sees nothing but getting their job done, but truth is her role is too one dimensional, and there was room for real depth here. Same is true with Jai Courtney and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. Jared Leto, isn't bad in his role, but it's hardly a role to speak about, and he was hyped from here to forever, so it was a letdown. But the roles that were properly written were really superb and the three actors I mentioned did them great justice. This together with a reasonable plot and solid technical aspects of this production, make it a worth your while movie. But once again this could've been a lot better, and the fact it's not is plain shame.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Bad Company,"(RATING: ☆☆☆½ out of 5 )THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Another sci-fi superhero fantasy that follows the formula alright but just isn't super.GRADE: B-SYNOPSIS: A band of rowdy misfits battle evil forces.JIM'S REVIEW: Bad is good. Let me re-phrase that...bad is kinda good. David Ayer's well-made but dull Suicide Squad is essentially a war film with ""flying men and monsters"", including a wicked woman who is ""a whole lotta of pretty and a whole lot of ugly"". There is a lot of chaos on screen, but most can be found in the film's muddle of a script. Its characters are ""bad to the bone"", but so is the weak screenplay.Is it as bad as most critics are saying? No...absolutely not, but it is not as good as it could have been. With a better script and a better villain (more on that later), the film could have been an all-out hit. The backstories of these misfits are the most entertaining parts of the film and Mr. Ayer's introduction of these personalities is concise and affecting. But his action sequences generally disappoint, with sub-par CGI and in-your-face rootin'-tootin' shoot-outs and gunfire, the kind of violence without consequences. Some of the jokes between the killer crew land, most don't. Much destruction and mayhem is present without the blood splatter and body count. (Still, the film's PG-13 rating is highly questionable.)The film also has little originality. It's more piecemeal of other films of this genre; some good (The Avengers series, Guardians of the Galaxy, Ghostbusters) and some bad (Sucker Punch, Green Lantern, Fantastic Four). It takes a worn-out premise from westerns (The Magnificent Seven, The Hateful Eight) and war films (The Dirty Dozen, Inglorious Basterds, the director's very own, Fury) of assembling a rowdy bunch of bad-asses to do the dirty work and save the world.Still the director continues to be a promising talent. (His 2014 film, Fury, made my Top Ten list for that year. It was a superior film with strong performances and excellent production values.) However, this offering lacks the latter but does have the former. Fortunately, Mr. Ayer has cast his film very well. So let's talk about some of the film's assets, primarily the four lead actors' performances. Will Smith as Deadshot, a hit man with perfect aim, aims perfectly with his character and gives one of his best and most believable performances in a long while. Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag, a mercenary soldier in charge of the squad, brings gravitas and vulnerability to his character. Viola Davis delivers the menace in large portions. But the real scene-stealer is Margot Robbie as the deranged Harley Quinn, a Kewpie doll who packs a wallop. Her acting has great nuance and she underplays the hammiest of lines. This just may be the breakout role the actress needs to become a big star and she is electric, the perfect fanboy fantasy. (This gifted actress is making a nice resume with her role choices.)The problem with Suicide Squad is the rest of the pack aren't that interesting and are sketchy and poorly drawn (again, the fault of the script). The actors in these parts are good enough, especially Jay Hernandez as the fiery conflicted Diablo, and an underused Jared Leto as The Joker. Yet the other characters, as written, are largely forgettable: Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), Boomerang (Jai Courtney) and Katana (Karen Fukuhara). The balancing act of bringing all of these marauders together becomes a jumble of forced equal screen time. Less would have been more.Beside a sub-standard screenplay (written by the director himself), the other major hurdle is the film's villain entitled The Enchantress, a laughable Mati Hari-type vixen that shimmies and gyrates and may radiate powerful gamma rays but displays no conflict or personality, let alone posing as a real threat. Without a real baddie at the center of the turmoil, the film has no sense of jeopardy or tension. The actress playing her, Cara Delevingne, rarely enchants, but she does keep a straight face throughout the film so that alone is a credit to her profession.Suicide Squad is not quite dead on arrival, as most reviewers might have you think. Due to some fine acting and some of Mr. Ayer's images, it does have a steady pulse.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A fun flick,"I'm gonna start this review by saying that Robbie was good,some corny lines,but she was still good,Leto is good for the amount of screen time he got,definitely will be a great Joker if he gets more screen time the next time he appears,and if you have to know,he's not better than Jack or Heath,but i liked his performance,some choppy editing,the Batman cameo was amazing,i loved Croc as well,but the best performance is by Will Smith as Deadshot and Joel Kinnamann as Rick Flag,they absolutely killed it,the villain was weak,Amanda Waller is a boss,the mid credits scene is also very cool,the movie had me on the edge of my seat,while not a amazing film,it's still very good,i think that this'll be the first DCEU movie that will get good reviews,and also the soundtrack is great.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
As a fan of 1987 Suicide Squad comics I was pleased,"First off, this can't be looked at in comparison to The Dark Knight because these are two very different stories in the Gotham Universe. People going into this with that mindset might be disappointed. I know this was more based off the 2011 Suicide Squad comics which I don't mind. I found it odd Deadshot got the spotlight as more of a ""main character"" type. It was something I could dislike easily because she's usually quiet and menacing in the background. Will Smith ended up playing a great Deadshot. As much as I love Harley, Joker steals the show. I love the classic cartoon Joker and he played it brilliantly.There's some good character development and the writing was more funny than I expected but DC is just so dark all the time I felt like it enhanced it. It's funny but in a dark twisted way in the comics. If I had to say some negatives... I don't like the shaky-cam action fight that are way too zoomed in to see anything. It was tolerable and there were some great action movie moments. However because they had character development, it allows the audience to care more about the fights/action. You can have a good character piece with bad action cause at least you care about what's going on. Bad writing or bad character presentation with great action will not get the crowd to have a reaction. But I wouldn't go as far as calling it bad. However the editing was terrible. I heard they took this movie into a focus group who knew nothing about movies or proper story structure for that matter and let them dictate what happened to it. David Ayer did a great job, don't ruin his work through editing. I'm reviewing this based off what I saw in his original idea. The movie would get a 9 if they didn't change it.I can't really judge it on a typical movie goer scale because I go to see the comic book movies for a reason. When they get it right, it's gold. I don't mind a few changes if they positively affect the overall outcome. This movie succeeded with that. I'd highly recommend to comic fans.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
actually OK with lots of annoying little problems,"Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) recruits various criminals from a black site in Louisiana to battle the new unprecedented dangers. June Moone (Cara Delevingne) is an archaeologist who got possessed by a witch named Enchantress. Special forces Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) fell in love with her and leads the group. Floyd Lawton (Will Smith) is assassin Deadshot who can't miss. The most important thing in his life is his daughter. George Harkness (Jai Courtney) is Captain Boomerang. Chato Santana is El Diablo but he has turned pacifist. Waylon Jones is Killer Croc. Tatsu Yamashiro is Katana with a soul stealing sword. There is Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), the psycho love of The Joker (Jared Leto). A powerful danger is unleashed in Midway City and the group is called.This was critically panned by the majority. I expected more of a mess. The story is simple and easy to follow. No doubt, there are some jarring edits with some disjointed flow. It's a little bothersome but it doesn't make it incomprehensible. The movie just keeps hitting speed bumps with annoying little problems. What's with Enchantress' movements? Her whole character is problematic. Why would Harley Quinn go back? Why would Waller kill everyone? There are varying problems in the writing. On the positive side, these are interesting characters well played by skilled actors. Will Smith, Margot Robbie, and Jared Leto are standouts. Joker and Harley Quinn have a great story together.

Walk to the building the movie,"After the death of Superman, the world has become more aware, for better or worse, of the existence of metahumans and their potential threat to society. In case another powerful being shows up that doesn't exactly stands by Superman's moral code, the U.S. government wants to be prepared. This is why Officer Amanda Waller teams up a bunch of the best/worse criminals and forces them into a special ops mission in order to protect the world from evils even greater than themselves. Can Amanda trust the city's safety into a team of dangerous delinquents or will they try to turn against the government and run for their freedom?Suicide Squad is the 3rd movie in the current DCEU, directed by David Ayer and his vision of what an anti-hero DC movie looks like. As a casual superhero fan, I don't have much background knowledge on the Squad. So this movie overtime became an opportunity to learn more about the more the more obscure DC characters that the mainstream audience may ignore. When the movie was initially announced, it seemed to be another dark and gritty entry in the DC movie series, but sometime after the BvS backlash and the success of Deadpool there was word that some scenes were re-shot to make the movie ""more fun"". Whatever that means. Now I didn't want to make much of it at the time, but then the marketing for this movie shifted into what I like to call ""unicorn puke"" level of color and imagery. I had concerns about it as it seemed that they were forcing to make this movie seem 'funner' than it actually was. How did that turn out?Let's begin with the good stuff. I absolutely loved the characters, specially Amanda, The Joker, Harley Quinn in all her annoying punch line glory, Will Sm.. I mean Deadshot, Enchantress, El Diablo I do think this movie's characters are very appealing and the cast certainly played their roles respectfully. I would love to see more of them in the future. Also the idea of an anti-hero team fighting a greater evil is pretty cool because that makes their motivations a lot more sensitive rather than just ""doing what's right"". The beginning scenes and the final battle were pretty exciting and loved every second of those. The cameos from the Justice League members were glorious. I admit I felt a sense of comfort and hype whenever Batffleck showed up in the movie. It really made this movie feel like a bridge to even greater things from the DC camp.I am from the crowd that does love the epicness Zack Snyder has brought to DC, so even though this movie was probably never meant to be as ambitious, I still had high standards for it. So that being said, there were things about it that certainly felt rough. Around the middle of the film particularly the pace is extremely slow, and I blame this on the fact that they started having deep conversations about the characters yet they spent very little time letting us get familiar enough with these characters. Their origin stories were literally reduced to a montage of 1 minute snippets each. It would have still been nice to have some extra context to them so we could relate more when the middle drama happened. Also, this made the movie feel like a 1 hour long ""walk towards the building"" scene were the only threat were putty-patrol looking baddies. The icing to the raw cake was that the ""forced fun"" was very blatant with the random mainstream songs shoved into the scenes and the non-funny cliché one-liners thrown almost every minute.Suicide Squad is a decent entry in the DCEU that while not my favorite, I still found enjoyable enough to celebrate and talk about. It does indeed help expand the lore of the DCEU and makes a better case for the Justice League than BvS did. Now after this movie we know how far society would go to embrace both the best side and the worse side of the metahumans war. It is a nice diversion until we get the upcoming more epic entries in this film series.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It's not as good as your expect nor as bad as you heard,"To start it off, i'm a big fan of dc cinematic universe, and the year 2016, hadn't been a good year for me and the other fans. Even though, i'll state myself optimistic, since actually, all my hopes and expectation fall into this movie instead.OK, Let's start with the strong aspects of the movie; performances and characters. well, i actually think this is what the director want to top off and show to the audience, thus forgetting the plot, which we will get into later. but the characters and the performances are well-performed- Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn really tops off my expectation. i'm a fan of harley quinn character, and she actually brought me the harley quinn i'm expected for- sexy, beautiful, it girl of joker's. while watching the movie, and whenever i'm feeling bored, harley quinn is there to make the scene fresh. and i think all audience, including audiences who didn't know her will love her and feel sympathetic to her. Will smith as deadshot actually didn't deserve much of my appreciation. i mean even though he's one of the great and strong aspect in the movie, i just thought i don't see will smith even trying to act, which weirdly works. watching Will smith here is just watching him using a kickass suit. Jared Leto as The Joker, is actually isn't the worst part of the movie (unlike what people might have said) i think that Jared Leto pull of a great effort into his character, and some scene of him showing up gave me goosebumps and own joys. but, maybe how little the scene for him is, or his character is pretty under-developed that just doesn't fit the puzzle in the movie. Viola Davis as Amanda Waller also brought up my her characther pretty well, as she played the cold-hearted leader Amanda Waller. other performances are great, like Joel Kinnaman, Jai Courtney, Jay Hernandez, Karen Fukuhara, and Cara Delevigne.The chemistry between the characters are great, as well as the development between their relationship. in my opinion, one of the strongest chemistry is Harley Quinn and Deadshot. Their chemistry is electric, funny, and watching them teasing, and slowly started to care about each other, is entertaining, and make me ship them together. even, i have a relationship that had a weak chemistry, that is Rick Flagg and June Moore's relationship which is bland, forced, and unnecessary.Now, parts that i think is the weak part of the movie, I think the plot is the main reason. The plot is lazy-written and under-developed,and at some point is pretty ridiculous. i don't want to get into it too much, since it will spoil some things, and i need you to watch the movie without spoilers, yet. even, i could tell you that the CGI is pretty cringy and sometimes, so does the visual effect between the scenes. the ending is actually rushed, predictable, and i think they could do better after building up the story of the fight scene.At the end, everything has its bad and has its good, what i really suggest for you to do is just lower your expectation, yet don't miss it either. it may not lift the hype as in the greatness in the trailer, but i think it's still a great fun must see summer movie , and you should enjoy it without all the overly negative critics.GUYS IM KIDDING THIS IS THE WORST FILM EVER DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME MONEY ON IT.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great acting with some funny jokes and good characters even if a bit of a mess,Suicide Squad was definitely a really fun movie! With some cool scenes and an outrageous cast!Pros. Will Smith did a great job in this movie. I knew he was gonna be good from the very beginning and he did not disappoint! He really brought that Will Smith charisma with him. And it turned out fantastic! Props to one of my favorite actors! Margot Robbie also did fantastic in the movie! She kicked so much butt! They also really get you to care about her character (like most of the other characters in this movie) And she did a great job! She must have gone into method acting because she was insane! Viola Davis as Amanda Waller........... MIND BLOWN! She did an outstanding job in this movie! Her script said she meant business and her acting showed it! And now lets talk about........ JARED LETO'S JOKER!!!!!!! To be honest even though we didn't get that much of him what we got of him was fantastic! Now I wouldn't say he's better than Heath Ledger's Joker. But I can see them both going into method acting! And they both did. The Action was also pretty cool in this movie! It was really awesome! There was this one scene where Deadshot (Will Smith's character) was shooting up an army of rock monsters and it was awesome! And I love how they got you to care about the characters before they sent them on a mission! I do feel like they could've spent more time on some of the characters that weren't Harley Quinn and Deadshot but I still liked the beginning! Cons. Now even though I said this movie was really fun its also a bit messy Now the movie has some great action sequences. But those action sequences.... BUT THOSE ACTION SEQUENCES ARE IN BETWEEN A BUNCH OF WALKING AND TALKING AND I DON'T HAVE PROBLEMS WITH WALKING AND TALKING IN MOVIES BUT IN THIS MOVIE IT GOT REALLY REPETITIVE CAUSE THIS HAD WAY TOO MUCH OF IT!!! Heres kind of the layout of this movie. 1st act: Characters being developed. 2nd act: Action and walking from point A to point B. 3rd act. Final battle. And the movie is really messy! Also Slipknot was terrible! He had so little screen time and so little lines that I can't even comment on Adam Beaches acting! I also hated Killer Croc. Now even though his makeup looks good he's a terrible character! He's just a big giant pun! He has some funny jokes in there but over all he didn't have much meaning to him! And that's sad cause he was one of my most anticipated characters to see in the movie! The villain was also really weak! I'm not gonna tell you the villain though cause that's kind of a spoiler but the villain is terrible! The rest of the characters are just meh (Those characters are Rick Flagg and Katana) So overall Suicide Squad is a fun movie with great characters fun charisma funny jokes and good action! Even if a weak villain and a messy plot! I will give Suicide Squad a C+,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
So Bad Even Shills Can't Ensure The Truth Won't Get Out,"Suicide Squad is a tedious movie. I saw this last night and I've tried to forget it ever since.From the get go, the Suicide Squad anti-heroes are introduced one- by-one. Then, once they're all given their backgrounds and clichéd introductions, they are delivered to their new boss, one . . . by . . . one. This consumes about the first 45 minutes, just before the meaningless action takes place.What's really ironic, More time is spent describing their ironic natures than explaining their first mission. Consequently, their first foray just seems pointless, because it is.The character development was weak and I really didn't care if they came back alive or not.HACK: In a fiction-writing context, the term is used to describe writers who are paid to churn out sensational, lower-quality ""pulp"" fiction such as ""true crime"" novels or action centered ""super hero movies"".Batman Begins (screenplay/director: Christopher Nolan) is a study in character development. Suicide Squad (David Ayer writer/director) is a hack job if there ever was one.And yet it has a 6.9 as I write this, so I see shills at work. Time will water this ""dog"" to it's real valuation, about 4.7 is my guess. I gave it a 1/10 because it's was insultingly bad.PS - Will Smith is interesting as usual, but not nearly enough to recommend this. This movie is a study in rote-cliché, predictable and plodding screenplay development, and extremely poor dialogue. Dead Pool is SO much better, that is if you want to laugh at super heroes.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
EXTENDED version SAVES the movie!!!,"Much like the success of the Batman v Superman EXTENDED version, the re-release of Suicide Squad is a sure-footed, spectacular story. It is more visually transfixing, increasingly good, and an evolutionary step forward in storytelling. Everything critics complained about the Joker is fixed as all his deleted scenes now included. More humor and character background restlessly are added amid the high-flying action. Katana initially seemed to unnecessary added, but now she has more backstory and her sword plays a bigger role in the climax. There are more Batman scenes with Killer Croc and Harley Quinn. The fifteen minutes added to the Joker and Harley Quinn subplot brings a new light to their relationship and their three-way conflict with Batman. This is the brilliantly clever movie that should have been released in the first place. DC's extended releases are redemption to the studio cuts. This is the winning movie fans were hoping to see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Unbelievable...,For the budget and start power... This was a total waste of time.I so want to like and enjoy this movie... But I simply couldn't...Over the top acting...Unrealistic story line...Lousy interactions...Even the bad guys are terrible at being bad...Batman... Hahaha... Utterly crap and needs a new bat-suit... This is an imitation Batman I need 10 lines but can't think of anything thing remotely decent to say about this movie...Oh... Will Smith... Missed the disaster of independence day but crapped out here instead...To anyone reading this...I implore you... don't waste your time and money... Don't even watch it on TV for free... I'm certain you'll find more joy watching grass grow...1.5 out of 10... Some OK explosions...,2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Not a masterpiece, but a great time!","Suicide Squad is a very hyped movie, with a lot of mixed reactions, even when there were no material at all to be shown yet. I notice how a lot of the hate was towards the new joker, played by Jared Leto. And indeed, I was also skeptical about this. He could either ruin the joker, or make it better. What did he do exactly? None of it, actually. Leto's performance in Suicide Squad as the Joker was good. He gave The Joker a new face, and in my truly honest opinion, he did it well. He tried to make it his own. Not replicate or try to live up to other actors that have been playing the joker in previous movies. Now, don't get me wrong, Jared Leto's joker is nothing against Heath Ledger's version. BUT and I say this once again; he didn't ruin it. That's really my honest opinion. He's not trying to be like Ledger, he's not trying to be something that we've seen before. He's doing something new, and I liked it. Also, for those of you who read the comics, you would actually notice that Jared's take on Joker is close to his persona in the comic book series. I actually wish that he would have had more screen time, since in the entire movie he was in maybe 20 minutes of the actual 2hr film. Now, I read about this final version, and it's said to be cut out a lot and that the director had been working on his own cut, while the studio made their own. So, I can barely wait for the Directors Cut to be coming out. Hopefully, more screen time for Leto will occur and maybe a lot better pacing.Enough talking about Leto; let's talk about the actual film itself. Critics have already been slaughtering the film, giving the film awful reviews and such- The thing is; I don't really trust critics. They are too narrow-minded, they act like they are the only one who's right. I never care about what people, especially critics say about films before I've actually watched them. Then I can look back, and see if I agree with them, based on my personal opinion and interpretation of the movie itself. I can not make you like this film. Just watch the movie yourselves, then judge the film. Many people have been throwing negative reviews on this film, without second thought and some have not even watched the film. This is the worst things about reviews by critics and reviewers on IMDb. You simply cannot trust anyone, including me. So I advise you to watch the film, go back and read my review and see if you agree. That way, you won't miss a move you might have liked. All the actors does a great job portraying their characters, even though Will Smith's performance as Deadshot was a bit meh. He was funny, though. But it just feels like Will Smith playing well, Will Smith. The flashbacks in this movie are the best scenes in my personal opinion. They give you a little more depth to the story and makes you sympathize for the characters. As a person who's watched a lot of Superheroes are good, villains are bad-movies, I thought it was refreshing that for once, the villains aren't portrayed as just pure evil. However; this film absolutely has flaws. Loads of them. But rarely any film these days is flawless. There's always going to be something that you can comment on and sometimes even get annoyed by. One thing is the pacing. This film is a chaotic mess when it comes to the pacing, confusing the viewer. Too fast, too slow, but never in between. When introducing the characters, I felt that the music was overused. Every time you met a new character, and this was in quite a short time, a new song would play. However, the soundtrack is good even though it feels a bit out of place.After the mess, called BvS, I am glad to say that this film changes a lot. It shows that DC doesn't always have to make overly serious films, but can have a little fun with it too. While I like Marvel films too, they are sometimes a little bit too cartoony, the humor can feel out of place and well let's face it, sometimes you need a superhero/villain film for adults.Visually this film is amazing in every way, the amount of detail and wonderful CGI is just pure eye candy. I loved the 3D, although it wasn't quite necessary, but hey, 3D is the standard these days for films in cinema. Overall, I do not think in my own humble and honest opinion that this move deserves the hate from the critics. Most moviegoers, people I know who have seen the film, liked it. It is not a masterpiece. Long way from that. It is not an Oscar winning film by no means. It's just a really fun film to watch and I've gotta say DC is pulling in the right direction. More work needs to be done, though and there is serious problems about this film despite it being enjoyable. Reading some interviews etc, I found that the script was very rushed. (Being finished in six weeks, not okay.) Also, while I laughed and giggled at some of the jokes, some of them felt forced and out of place. However, DC has taken a huge step and I hope they will be making more movies like this one.As a final verdict, I think this movie is worth your time and is a good watch. Don't listen to critics. Heck, don't take my word for granted either. You will love it, or hate it. That's how it works, we have different opinions and tastes. I was not disappointed and I look forward to the next installment in the DC universe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Don't listen to the so called ""critics"" , the movie is fun","This movie is super fun. Im gonna make it short, as everything probably been said many times. I was not fond of Will Smith being cast as Dead Shot, that's who i had in mind after watching the actor in Arrow. But Will Smith is so charismatic and fun he made me forget all about it. Marggot Robbie as Harley Quinn is just awesome. Even Jai Courtney is very good at Boomerang. Actually my only complain with this character is that there is not enough of him !!! lol The story is basic sure, but it work. Lots of great action. Look although i did like Deadpool, i tough this movie was even better, yeah no jokes.My only big problem with the movie is i am not a fan of Pimp Joker. I mean the actor did a great job with what he had to work with, but the look is completely off. Joker should NOT be tattooed, no matter if once in the comic he was or whatever. The street gang metal teeth look ridiculous too. But Jared Leto has the face for it tough, make up wise and hair colour, that was good. His acting was convincing.So yeah i had tons of fun with Suicide Squad, gonna buy it when it comes out on DVD for sure.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Happy, gritty fun.","Every now and then there is a movie with a great cast line up and fun creative out of the box idea. This is that movie.

The film doesn't waste one second of enjoyable footage with stunning action an amazing soundtrack it shows how dc is really not failing to disappoint it's fans. This movie is good even for people who don't follow comics or watch the other films this movie still amazes random viewers. It's creative aspect follows throughout with good crummy jokes and a threatened appearance. everyone has a good role in the film. Jared Leto kicks it well as the joker showing off his impressive laugh and dark skill set. Margot Robbie plays the mysterious, crazy Harley Quinn who will make anyone want to fall to their knees begging for more.No matter what this is not a film to miss.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Turning point for DC movies.  They have listened to the fans and delivered.,"After receiving poor feedback from previous movies DC have finally acted to please the fans.This is a joy to watch and will keep you thrilled in action as well as smiling at the dialogue, the performances of such diverse characters and the absurdity of the situation with a more magical/fantasy aspect not quite seen enough in superhero movies yet.Some slight pacing issues can slow down the story at times and it does feel a little too long than it needs to be, but overall humorous tone and funny dialogue is a change well-welcomed in a DC movie.Job well done.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Entertainingly eccentric.,"The hype surrounding this deranged blockbuster couldn't have been any higher. The casting was bold, director David Ayer promised to bring his off-kilter style to proceedings and the trailers were downright awesome. That it doesn't quite reach the exceedingly lofty heights many were expecting shouldn't come as a shock, however there's enough fun and flair to ensure this demented romp all but wipes away the disappointment that was Batman v Superman. The tremendously enjoyable first act serves as a crazy meet-and-greet – with cool character title cards and all – establishing an excitingly wild tone, although this gradually dampens into something more generic by the bland and uninspired final act. The biggest problem with the last 30 minutes is undoubtedly how rote it feels, the dull CGI villains offering zero thrills and the climactic save-the-world sequence a muddled and dull affair with no ingenuity whatsoever. But what comes before the finale is oh-so-good. It's a rollicking ride of gunfights, swordplay and witty barbs as the titular ragtag group of anti-heroes reluctantly band together to defuse a mystical terrorist attack, or else be killed by the explosive chip implanted in their necks by ruthless government agent Amanda Waller (Viola Davis hamming it up). An early battle against mindless henchmen culminating in Deadshot (Will Smith) stepping up to single-handedly wipe the horde out is an action-based highlight, closely followed by a daring rooftop escape by Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie). Speaking of Robbie, she's arguably the standout amongst an overall solid cast, although Smith is as cocky and cool as ever, Jai Courtney is surprisingly excellent as Aussie bank-robber Boomerang and Jay Fernandez is suitably dangerous as walking flamethrower Diablo. The big question though: how does Jared Leto's Joker stack up against past incarnations? His laughing maniac is old-school gangster meets volatile nut-job, an utterly watchable psycho who commands the screen with every sneered line or outrageous cackle. Leto and Robbie share an amazing chemistry on screen, their energetic and erratic relationship – a comic-book version of Bonnie and Clyde if you will – is a ticking time bomb of death and destruction, which is why their limited time together is a crime. Not the mind-blowing film it could've been, but with one of the best soundtracks this side of a Tarantino flick and a wickedly cavalier attitude to accompany a wickedly cavalier group of (bad) good guys, Suicide Squad is an entertainingly eccentric entry into the DC Cinematic Universe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The 'Dirty Dozen' with super-villains,"After the death of Superman those in power worry how the Earth would cope if the next super-powered being to turn up used their power to defeat rather than help humanity. To that end Task Force X, AKA the Suicide Squad, is established; a group made up of the most dangerous super-villains who have been captured! Of course they cannot be trusted but with an explosive charge placed in their necks they might just behave. When a threat emerges they are led by Col Rick Flag to confront that threat... which just happens to involve the woman Flag loves.Even before I watched this I'd heard it was pretty terrible... I wouldn't say it was that bad but it could have been so much better. Too much of the film's opening was dedicated to showing us how the various villains got caught; something that wasn't really necessary. Then when the action started much of it was too dark... as in it was hard to see what was happening. Tonally it wasn't dark enough; these are meant to be super-villains but the film didn't seem that violent... it would have been better had it been as violent as 'Kick-Ass' or even 'Dredd' but I guess the makers wanted a teen-friendly rating. The cast are solid enough; Margot Robbie stole just about every scene she was in with her performance as the crazy and dangerous, but still likeable Harley Quinn; Jared Leto impressed as The Joker, although his character wasn't in the Squad and was sorely underused. Overall I'd say this was entertaining enough but if you expect something great you are likely to be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not my cup of tea,"I sometimes feel a little disconnected as I'm not a lover of superhero type films, but I'll always compromise and go and them with friends.

I can't say the acting was bad, Will Smith I really liked, and despite not particularly being a huge fan, I'd say one of Cara Delevingne's better performances.Some great special effects, perhaps a film if have enjoyed if I was twelve. At this very time I'd have to say I thought it was very poor. 3/10.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"DC shows improvement, but still disappoints with Suicide Squad","Going into 2016, Suicide Squad was actually my second most anticipated superhero movie behind only Captain America Civil War. The marketing team did an absolute superb job selling this movie through some of excellently edited trailers and an surprisingly good original soundtrack, an addition that should be considered by more studios. By the time August came around, I had reached a level of excitement almost equal to that of Guardians of The Galaxy. Unfortunately, I left the theatre disappointed, but hopeful for the future of DC films. OK, so I know my tone may seem overly negative, but let me say that I really did enjoy the film. Much like Batman V. Superman, it does not deserve the reviews it's been getting from critics. The film improves upon DC's previous outing by introducing a much more lighthearted tone, at least for the film's first half, crafting a more clear and linear story, and also featuring better character development. Suicide Squad has many of the elements of a typical summer blockbuster which can't help but make it entertaining. While it may not have met my expectations, it still proved to be another enjoyable superhero movie, and that's enough for me. However, as I previously mentioned, this film has an abundance of flaws. While I did do a good amount of nit-picking, there a couple of particular problems that can't be ignored. The first lies in Suicide Squad's villain. I'm sure I'm not the first to say it, but just about everything about the Enchantress is bad. To begin, she was mistakenly marketed as being a member of the team, which lead many (including me) to believe Monster T would be the villain! Her ""host"" or whatever June Moore adds absolutely nothing to the story. Her brother is just a big pile of confusing CGI mess. Finally, her evil plan to destroy the world is given no backstory or motivation. Suicide Squad also suffers from an editing process that structures the movie in a very unusual way that screws up the pacing as well as the overall tone of the movie, which makes a dramatic shift from lighthearted and fun to dark and gritty. Finally, there's the Joker. I thought Jared Leto did a great job creating one of the most unique Joker's that has ever been portrayed on the big screen. However, I believe there isn't enough of him in the movie to formulate a fair assessment of his performance. One thing I can criticize is his role in the movie, which I felt did not fit. The Joker is mainly just there for some flashbacks that make the mistake of cramming a movie's worth of backstory into a couple of scenes. I understand that he wasn't supposed to have a major role, but I believe the tease David Ayer did give us did not fully represent the notorious Clown Prince of Crime. Suicide Squad is full of potential, and I believe going forward, this will be a great learning opportunity for DC. It shows how to successfully market a movie, provides a glimpse of how to incorporate a more lighthearted tone without being campy, and also displays the importance of proper character development. Repeat this process and then improve upon the movie's faults, and nothing would stop me from seeing a Suicide Squad 2.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A beautiful mess,"First off, the movie is beautiful to look at and the squad is awesome. The way they are introduced is awesome. The music is perfect. The pace is a bit off at times and the jokers scenes feel rushed and choppy. He's never on screen long enough to get immersed in his character. This feels like editing issues after the fact. Harley Quinn is awesome, and Deadshot is perfect. The movie would have been amazing if it focused on the Joker as its villain but sadly it chooses to have a CGI Saturday morning cartoon villain instead (truly the films weakest link). It's easy to see why the critics are bashing SQ. it feels forced and rushed. As if the camera is afraid to give any one character too much screen time. Killer Croc is visually great but has the worst lines to say (his one liners fall flat). Boomerang is great. That's all I'm going to say because I enjoyed the movie. It's a mess, it's kind of like making a bacon lettuce tomato sandwich and at the last minute you realize you are out of mayo. It's still great but it's missing an important ingredient and in this case, a worthy villain of such a worthy Squad. I wanted More.

This is a total disgrace to the DC Villains,"The whole plot of the movie was a mess. It really confused me what all the characters in the film was fighting for, I mean there was no real goal of the movie for the first 70% of the time. Then they set up the story in a way where the friend turns into the foe, and those friends are now facing this foe as their primary enemy and not the one it was shown at the beginning of the movie. I think the whole script was written by a total non professional guy who needs to again go through the basic levels of a film school. This movie made DC lose its fame towards its fans and I hope they bounce back in their next show. Thank you",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
DC on life support,"I wanted to like this movie. I really did. The trailers and advertising was so good that it was impossible to not feel some hype. I'm also a big DC universe fan and really wanted to see them finally find some footing. Sadly this movie was a let down. The first act is all one giant spoon fed exposition as we have only a few of the casts backstories jammed down our throats. The rest of them are left one dimensional and they never feel more real than cartoons. A good film doesn't need to spend so much time shoveling out exposition. Look at Guardians Of The Galaxy. That movie just did such a great job creating rich characters, each earning their time on screen, who's chemistry with each other was electric that you got everything that you needed to know about them.Will Smith is great at playing Will Smith. He's as charismatic as ever and definitely adds some fun moments. However he is NOT Deadshot and portrays the character far more as a redeemable hero than he is meant to be. Margot Robbie is every bit as good as we all hoped. She's one of the few things that the movie totally delivers on. Jared Leto as Joker ... where oh where did you go wrong? This is the first cinematic version of the character that falls flat. He brings nothing memorable or interesting to the character. With how much he was hyped, with his method acting and claims about how terrifying he was on set, I definitely expected more. True his screen time is minimal but the second you saw the other Jokers that's all you needed to know that they were iconic. This Joker just wasn't. I mean he wasn't bad but he fell into that just barely serviceable category which is extra disappointing in a way. I expected so much more from him and now I'm very unenthusiastic of him appearing in future films. Jai Courtney is fun but under used. I kept forgetting that Killer Croc was in this movie. The rest of the cast does OK with what little they have.The threat in the film is way too supernatural and cartoony to fit the gritty dark world surrounding it. It's amazing how many possibilities they could have taken with villains and that this was the best they could do is pretty baffling. The action has it's moments but is also pretty repetitive at times. Sure there was some key moments that I enjoyed. It's just as a whole the movie was a let down. The cameos were fun I guess. The music was solid but the movie some times felt like a giant advertisement to buy the soundtrack with how often songs were forced in. All in all it's just another brick in the wall. Uninspired and unmemorable. It's not going to do much to help establish the DCEU. They really need Wonder Woman to be something special to pull this series out of this state of just being ""OK"". They need to be great next time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Suicide Squad,It was one of the most excited movies to watch in 2016 but I was very disappointed. The story was bad and the film was very bad and the movie tries to cram the comedy into the movie.

"what did you expect, Citizen Kane?  I LOVE THIS MOVIE!","Some movies are strictly entertainment. Some movies are deep meditations on the human condition. Most of us go to the movies for the first. SUICIDE SQUAD is for you. This is an action extravaganza, full of popcorn munching fun, explosions, and fight scenes. All the actors play their parts well, but Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Jared Leto as the Joker are particularly good. Could there be more plot? Yes, but its a super- villain turned heroes flick----gather the team, beat the bad guy, save the world---. Harley Quinn does crazy REALLY well. Jared Leto is a Joker we've not seen before. He's not making a point to anyone, he is just doing his own (totally psychotic) thing. The soundtrack crushes with lots of classic rock, and there are few dull moments. I hope we'll see more Suicide Squads in the future, but I would totally be down for a Joker/Harley movie with Leto and Robbie. One last point. Its really sad to see reviewers, and by this I mean so called professionals, carry over their personal political/social/moral biases over into the treatment of a movie.

Suicide Squad?? Morelike Suicide DCU,"If you expect this movie to be a great fusion of picaresque and superhero genre, you are wrong. This is really a desperate attempt from WB and DC to revive the dying DCU, so they decided to copy what they think makes marvel movies such a success. A PG13 lighter atmosphere and add some comedy. Really? is this what DC thinks people like watch Marvel movies for? Well if they really wanted to be successful like a marvel movie, they should try to make something like Deadpool. Rated R, some blood and anti-hero stuff.As usual DCU completely missed thing that make Marvel movie successful. A good script that makes sense. This is just a movie that introduces less popular DC characters nothing more nothing less. The whole movie is like ""This guy is Deadshot he shoots guns! This guy is Killer croc, he is scaly! Here is katana she is for all weeaboos! We have more than Batman and Superman you know.""When all the introduction is done, half of the movies is done. And the rest is just rushed plot and really bad PS3 level CG and action to fill up the rest of the time. In the name of bad script, bad CG, bad action.

Hollywood please....just stop it,"Yesterday I went to a sort of premier of this film and I found it so bad that I had to share the experience and ask viewers to stop feeding this blockbuster industry, just stop it.

If you stop giving money to these people, maybe they'll start hiring new decent writers, directors, producers, editors, production designers, etc.This film had potential, it's a film that could have been great, but it was not because the production companies don't understand that the ""big shots"" don't know how to make decent films. I bet the shooting of blockbusters is similar to the shooting soap operas, the actor gets there and the director says ""now pretend you're sad and say the line"". There is no acting.I feel bad for the actors because this is the type of film that can ruin a career.Dear Hollywood, you know why everybody loves Deadpool?

Basically you watch a whole bunch of villain misfits walking down the street having moments with each other while on their little silly quest that brought them somehow together.

"Despite what many critics have to say, this is a very good movie","This is a good, fun movie. If you like comic book movies you will enjoy ""Suicide Squad"". I'm not sure why many critics think that this great movie was so ""terrible"". It had great acting from the entire cast, especially Margot Robbie and Will Smith and it had just the right amount of jokes. That being said this movie wasn't perfect either, but no movie is. The story could have been better, but it was still good and worked fine for Suicide Squad. Also, it should have been longer. When you have so many character that haven't been on the big screen before this you need to use as much time as possible to develop their back stories, which wasn't done very well. For the characters with the largest roles like Deadshot or Harley Quinn their are fairly short backstories, while the backstories for characters like Killer Croc are given no screen time. This doesn't take away from the overall film too much, but it is the reason that I couldn't give it a 10/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not that good,"I happened to watch the two suicide squad films in reverse order, and though this one was not that good, it was far better than the second one. Unfortunately both suffered from the same issues... they were completely over the top with far too much excess in almost everything they did (the second one just did a better job of being bad, lol).On the bright side, however, this one did have a certain amount of charm, and I did enjoy a bit of the banter between the characters. Additionally, some of the action scenes were very good. But, even given those few accolades, overall the movie was sub par.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fun movie with good performances.,"It probably isn't gonna win any awards but damn! I had a good time watching it. It can get a little bit hard to follow but it does have a reasonably coherent plot(kinda simple, but there are surprises). Soundtrack was pretty good and used effectively most of the time. Margot Robbie and Will Smith shine as Deadshot and Harley Quinn, supporting cast is highly effective and overall all the characters were done justice. In conclusion, its a good summer movie to watch with friends and have a good laugh with good fight scenes. I would like to say that I noticed a lot of scenes were cut out and in the beginning there were way too many cuts in some scenes but it does not hold back this film.

Deceptive Film with a Lame Story,"After the death of Superman, the leader of a secret agency Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) convinces the government to recruit super-villains imprisoned in Belle Eve to protect the world. She summons the hit-man Deadshot (Will Smith); The Joker's girlfriend and former psychiatrist Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie); the pyrokinetic Diablo (Jay Hernandez); the bank thief Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney); the mutant Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje); the criminal Slipknot (Adam Beach); and the witch Enchantress that possessed the former archaeologist June Moone (Cara Delevingne) to form The Task Force X. Waller also assigns the command of the team to Colonel Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), who is in love with June. To convince the group to obey orders, a nano bomb is implanted in the neck of each member. When Enchantress releases her powerful brother and they besiege Midway City turning the residents into an army of monsters and building a powerful weapon. Meanwhile The Joker (Jared Leto) is plotting a plan to rescue his beloved Harley Quinn.""Suicide Squad"" is a deceptive film with a lame story and terrible director that waste a magnificent cast. Margot Robbie steals the show and Jared Leto makes a creepy The Joker, but it is not enough to save this film. Waller killing her own team is not dark, but awful. The CGI is poor and the best is the music score with classic rock. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Esquadrão Suicida"" (""Suicide Squad"")",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
So much potential,I went into this movie with high hopes and the first half delivered. The characters introduced were great fun with some good action to boot. Viola Davis cemented her place in DC's future with her standout performance & Margot Robbie was born to play Harley Quinn it would seem but the film failed to live up to the hype largely due to the DC formula of having to end with a giant CGI battle that undoes most of the hard work out in beforehand.I'm not saying this film is perfect without the last act but it had the chance of being so much better. The action is hard to follow and the character played by cara delavine is hard to watch due to the unnecessary CGI.The film is saved from being absolutely abysmal by some of the performances we see and isn't helped by how strong the sequel/requel by James Gunn is.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Did not like it,"""Suicide Squad"" earns my 6/10 rating, as it wasn't a bad entry in the superhero genre. The standout element of the film is its cast, with Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn and Will Smith's Deadshot delivering charismatic performances that inject humor and humanity into their characters. However, the film's strength is hampered by uneven pacing, with a slow start and rushed finale. The weakness lies in the underdeveloped antagonist, who lacks depth and motivation. The music, featuring a memorable soundtrack, adds an energetic layer to the action sequences. While ""Suicide Squad"" doesn't reach the heights of some other superhero films, it still offers an entertaining and sometimes darkly comedic take on the antihero genre.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A fun ride,"We have seen a multitude of superhero movies in recent years, from the ultimate good guys, bad-ass anti-heroes and revisionist takes on the genre. Now there is DC's Suicide Squad, a team of bad-guys who have to do high-risk missions for the American government.Suicide Squad picks up where Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice left off. Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) is a senior government official who wants to create a team of meta-humans to do the dangerous missions. Her recruits include Deadshot (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), El Diablo (Jay Hernandez) and Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). The team is called into action when an incident devastates Midway City and to ensure compliance the members have an explosive device implanted in their necks.Suicide Squad is at best in its early potions when Amanda Warner introduces us to the members of the squad before their recruitment. It was an expository sequence but it was made with energy as it shows the backstories of the members of the squad, showing their rap sheets in brightly coloured text and embracing its comic book source material - there is a great homage to a famous comic book painting by Alex Ross.Warner Brothers went full out when searching for its cast and crew, getting David Ayer to write and direct and forming an all star cast. Will Smith and Margot Robbie got the most attention as Deadshot and Harley - Deadshot display Smith's on screen charisma, a smart mouthed criminal who knows how to play hand when negotiating with gangsters and the government. He was one of the most well defined of all the characters, having a rivalry with Rick Flagg (Joel Kinnaman), a Special Forces soldier who thinks the hit-man would run off. For fans of Smith you get more of what you like. Robbie was a perfect as Harley Quinn - speaking with exaggerated Brooklyn accent Robbie portrayal was like previous iterations in Batman: The Animated Series and the Batman: Arkham games, being a crazy minx who has unhealthy relationship with The Joker. Hernandez was also a standout as El Diablo, a man who wants to suppress his powers and seek some sort of redemption.Viola Davis and Jared Leto were also great in their supporting roles and hopefully we shall see more of them in the DCEU. Amanda Waller, a Machiavellian woman who would do anything to survive and protect 'national security' - she can become the DCEU's Nick Fury, a woman who does not have any super powers but can handle her own in a world of superheroes and villains. As she says in the film she has a talent for getting people to act against their interest. Leto is a terrific actor, but it was an unenviable task of replacing Heath Ledger as The Joker. Yet he succeeds - Leto's version of The Joker is a cruder and more sadistic character, someone who enjoys violence. The Joker was spurious to the plot, he was only introduced to the film so he can be ready for future DCEU films.Other characters were poorer presentations. Akinnuoye-Agbaje is a huge bloke and physically looks the part as Killer Croc, but the character may as well not have appeared in the film - he was just a thug and had no characteristics. The pitch of voice was lowered too much to be believable and it became distracting. Delevingne was miscast as Enchantress . Her human alter-ego is meant to be an archaeologist, but she looks like barely graduated from High School let alone have a PHD. When Delevingne first appears as Enchantress she had a creepy look to her, having a dark complexion and black smoke whirling around her. When Enchantress has her completed form she becomes less effective - she did jerky dance movements and her voice was dubbed with an older English voice which did not fit. The point was to make Enchantress other worldly yet it did not work.Warner Brothers and DC were aiming to make their version of Guardians of the Galaxy. They go to the point where they have a pop soundtrack like their Marvel rivals and are trying to match its tone. The film works best when it shows the relationships between the villains, delving into their past and the conflict of doing their job and their own self-interest. It made for an interesting twist to the superhero genre. However, after the great start Suicide Squad does not stick to its convictions and goes into familiar superhero territory of stopping a big bad guy trying to make a devastating weapon and the film attempts to give the characters a connection with each other, instead of showing them for what they really are, self-interested villains. The film also suffers from writing and editing problems, one character was introduced just so he could be killed.The problem with the DCEU is it's trying to catch up with the MCU, but by doing that it's trying to do too much too quickly - flooding their franchise with characters without much of an introduction. Marvel Studios were able to play the long game and it benefited the series because all the characters get an introduction and the various sci-fi, fantasy and paramilitary elements. Suicide Squad was a way for the DCEU to quickly introduce their villains (as well as some heroes) and it inexplicitly brings in fantasy ideas like a woman having a sword that captures the souls of the people it kills.Suicide Squad does not deserve some of the bad reviews it has received; it is still an entertaining and more ballsy attempt at a mainstream superhero film - it has a 15 rating in the UK. Its basic heroics plot is nothing new or that inventive, yet it does work changing up some of superhero (or should it be supervillain?) dynamics and it does a fine job at introducing some of the DC villains.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not A Bad Movie!,"I've been a marvel fan for years and finally decided to watch the DC movies (in release order).I gotta say the reviews are kind of throwing me off so far, and I think it's because you guys hear about a movie and think how you want the movie to be and think about how it was in the comics and when it's not like that, you're disappointed.Watching this movie knowing nothing about the comics or characters is probably why I was able to enjoy it because I didn't have certain expectations.But even with all that aside, this movie does check pretty much all the boxes for a good superhero movie. (even though they're all bad people lol) After seeing Man Of Steel, Batman v Superman, and Wonder Woman, it's felt good to watch a movie that wasn't constantly dark, grim, and serious the whole time.You see some of the character's regrets and desires and honestly near the end you do root for them to win and enjoy seeing them fight together. At least I did.Yes it could've been a lot better, but it was NOT bad at all and think it deserves a bit more credit.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Entertaining and enjoyable despite some flaws!,"For starters, I am both a Marvel and DC fan, but I'll admit that DCU movies have not been that good lately when compared to MCU movies. Nonetheless, I found this movie entertaining and enjoyable. I found movies like Man of Steel just ""okay"" and Batman V. Superman was over decent; still, I was still hyped for the Suicide Squad and was excited to see what they would offer.Every movie has its flaws, and I tried my best to stay away from reading reviews before watching this movie. Your best bet is to just go in blind and not hold any expectations and see how this movie will affect you. I was excited because of their direction with a DC movie that has a cast of all villains/anti-heroes, but I was also a little skeptical seeing how DC movies have been a bit lacking lately.I really liked this movie, of course it has its cons like any other film. I love all the characters, the action was fun to watch, and it made me laugh several times throughout the movie. My biggest issue with the Suicide Squad was mainly about how they chose to focus on the characters. Some characters got a lot more screen time and had occasions where their background was explored a little more deeply, while some characters didn't get that much time or focus.Realistically, the cast was large so it would be more confusing and overbearing if they took too much time with each character. (That's also a double-edged sword though, in my opinion). I wish they would have given more screen time or backstory to the other characters, as I really loved Boomerang and Katana, but they didn't have much of an opportunity to be explored more. You do get a good amount of Harley Quinn and Deadshot, which is nothing to complain about as they're also both great characters.Overall, pretty good movie. It was entertaining and enjoyable, and I love all the characters. I wished they would give more time to other members of the squad instead of focusing on just a few too much. Some action scenes felt satisfying while some felt just mediocre. A tip would be to try and not hold any expectations or have your mind be painted by critics or other viewers, go see it and decide yourself! Despite some minor flaws here and there, you'll find an entertaining summer movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Fun not great,"The anticipated Suicide Squad is in cinemas and is okay. Following the events of Dawn of Justice, Amanda Waller assembles a team of villains to work together to stop a supernatural threat. Directed by David Ayer (not Snyder) the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) continues to grow by introducing the DC equivalent of Guardians of the Galaxy (the only difference being that Guardians of the Galaxy is a masterpiece). The Squad consists of Deadshot (Will Smith) Haley Quinn (Margot Robbie) Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) El Diablo (Jay Hernandez) and some other character shoe horned inn, also the Joker Played by Jared Leto.So what is expected of the film on one hand is provided, as kick ass, cool, and loud action to make a real fun cinema experience. On the other hand what was also expected was an awesome strong film with consistency, but this is not quite the same film I saw in the trailers.So what happens to the film is a rushed pace, that goes wonky at the end, with some layered characters next to some very un-layered characters in a narrative with not much consistent direction. What holds the film together is Margot Robbie's performance which really carries everything with her pure insanity. Although Will Smith plays a pretty cool Deadshot, all I see is Smith being the same as he always is in every other film. So what should be a Squad becomes a duo as these two are the only real characters in the whole film. Which brings us to Jared Leto. We all know that no actor could beat the great Heath Ledger when it comes to playing the Joker, and Leto holds no candle at all, by providing a gangster Joker which no one asked for. What Leto does nail is the scary intimidation of the Joker, but struggles to be the Joker we all know and love.What is also a vital part to the film is the action sequences, which are enjoyable at first but end up getting more dramatic. This is also supported by a very strong use of CGI which pretty much invades the whole film. The film also provides entertainment with its humour which we were hoping to quite consistent, but it appears every line has to be delivered by Robbie or Smith as the scene is about to end.What I also found annoying was the narrative as it feels sloppy and does feel like its heading in the direction it should do, and with the consistent mad and fun atmosphere flowing through, but it does not quite match with what it concludes with at the end.The DCEU so far has not had a good start, but at the moment Suicide Squad is the lesser of three evils, with enjoyable action and fun. 7.0/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Welcome to the Injustice League,"This is my review for Suicide Squad (spoiler free)****(4/5)A lot of people said that End of Watch (2013) writer/director David Ayer was crazy but nobody thought he was this crazy but here it is the craziest superhero/villain movie in existence. Which is a strong and stern addition to the DCEU, and it doesn't take itself too seriously unlike BvS which pretty much just had special effects pizazz to get it's point across, and didn't have any funny dialogue unlike this. Even though in some areas the dialogue is a bit bumpy and could have been better but all is forgiven. Because from the trailer which was released earlier this year and is one of the most viewed trailers on Youtube for movies 2016, it showed that this blockbuster is going to brilliantly bonkers and it is but not too bonkers it still has some serious bits. Which is better than BvS which made people feel more fatigued than there were enjoying it. But enough about that.The story is somewhat okay in this, you can tell it's there but it does fall flat for a few instances and alongside the plot it has the craziness that this Machiavellian crew all have in common. But with the editing it's a little faster due to the executive producer Zach Snyder it's a little darker than normal but that's not to say that, that is a bad thing it just makes the film a bit more serious which is one thing the Suicide Squad shouldn't be especially because in the comics the characters were all nuts, with the insane Harley Quinn as the leader. The characters in this are amazing you can tell that they are taken straight out of the comic book, even with Jared Leto's Joker who isn't part of the Suicide Squad comics just shows to be a formidable force along with the ride. His Joker is brilliant but lacks on thing and that is the purple attire the Joker is famous for but he does rock the 'Damaged' tattoos, also he lacks the insanity of previous Jokers but that's not his fault he still adds a certain efficiency to the story, and at some points makes it better.But the show-runner is Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn who looks astonishing in the characters skimpy clothes, and she certainly shows the craziness of the real Harley Quinn straight out of the comic and her one-liners are just hysterical, and one of a kind. However when it comes to the action they all have their special trademark attacks but the one that shows strongest is Will Smith's Deadshot proving to be a better shooter than we last lead to believe he keeps the team strong even when some (Harley Quinn) have their crazy moments. Aside from all the fast-paced action which is amazing by the way it has very good special effects which look absolutely astonishing to match with the purple and green title screen and well it certainly is a strong point of the film. Also one quick thing to add Viola Davis nails her part as secretary Amanda Waller.But on the low side it lacks the origin stories of the characters, the stories are there but they aren't as prominent as I'd hoped, and also they don't last too long and also it looks like the film just cares about the two crazy mains, who are funny which proves that David Ayer can do comedy but it looks like they take the lead way too, the other characters do make an impact though they're left standing like statues. In conclusion even without the stories this is a strong and stern addition to the DCEU and will go down in history as one of the craziest but great DC films. And certainly is better looking and makes you show your sense of humor which is one thing that Zach Snyder lacks.Verdict: A brilliantly bonkers addition to the DCEU filled with enigmatic action and crazy parts that will make even the calmest mind go crazy. Welcome to the Injustice League.8/10 full of energy and action.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Antithesis of Batman v Superman,"Despite the fact that Zack Snyder is credited as an executive producer of Suicide Squad, David Ayer's film is essentially the antithesis of Snyder's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Whereas Snyder's film was overstuffed, dragged out, and took itself too seriously, Ayer's film is nearly the polar opposite. Suicide Squad nails the concept of an ensemble cast. Each character is given nearly equal amounts of screen time, and every character is given enough depth in order to stand out and keep the film interesting. Normally comic book adaptations try to cram too many characters into any given film, but Suicide Squad gets it right. Similarly, most comic book adaptations suffer from an extended running time, allowing the film to feel boring and painfully slow at times. However, Suicide Squad is wildly fast-paced and never seems to have a dull moment. A 130-minute running time felt more like 90 minutes. In addition, the film boats a spectacular soundtrack, which really contributes to the fast-paced nature of the film and serves to keep things fun. However, one could argue that the film's fast pace and nonstop action serve to distract viewers from the numerous flaws lurking within the film. Perhaps the biggest difference between Snyder's film and Ayer's film is the fact that Suicide Squad doesn't take itself too seriously. That point is made perfectly clear early on in the film when each character is introduced in quick, flashy montages. With that said, this is a film that doesn't want to be taken too seriously. If you are going to nitpick the film or compare it to previous works, you most likely will walk away unhappy. However, if you do not take the film too seriously then it truly is a fun time. Suicide Squad manages to strike the perfect balance between darkness and lightheartedness, something that previous DC adaptations lacked. While the film benefited from a pretty stellar marketing campaign, the marketing may have been misleading seeing as the Joker doesn't have much of a presence in the film. Nonetheless, this is probably for the best because the Joker was quite possibly the worst aspect of the film. The costume design is just atrocious and turns the Joker into a parody of himself. While Jared Leto provides a satisfyingly menacing performance, the strength of his performance is hindered by his physical appearance. The real showstoppers here are Margot Robbie and Will Smith. While Robbie's performance is likely to face plenty of criticism due to this being the first live- adaptation of Harley Quinn, I truly cannot think of an actress more perfect for the role. She remarkably captures the contrast between Harley Quinn and Harleen Quinzel. Meanwhile, Will Smith steals nearly every scene he's in and his comedic-timing is absolutely effortless. While Suicide Squad may not be perfect, it's refreshing to have a DC adaptation that doesn't take itself too seriously. Suicide Squad is also refreshing for those unhappy with the lack of diversity in comic book adaptations, Will Smith even pointed out during the premiere how diverse the cast is. It's also refreshing to have a film that focuses on the villains, because after a while the hero stories just become repetitive and dull. In a sense, Suicide Squad is DC's answer to Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy – a fun, action-packed adventure that humanizes the bad guys and features a killer soundtrack. As long as viewers don't overanalyze and nitpick the film, this is guaranteed to be the most fun viewers have at a DC film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

It was actually very good. I enjoyed it!,"So after a decent start with a pretty good but not so amazing ""Man of Steel"", and a disappointing follow up with the terrible ""Batman v Superman"", comes the third movie of DC Extended Universe. Suicide Squad!From the guy who brought you ""Fury"", David Ayer delivers an action packed, entertaining movie with a lot of interesting characters, dark humour, decent CGI effects, and fast pacing. Maybe it wasn't the best DC movie I've ever seen, but it's a lot more better than ""Man of Steel"" and ""Batman v Superman"" combined.This is the good things of the movie: The casting is excellent! The introduction of the main characters was well performed. Will Smith is doing great at being cool as usual. I was kinda worried that Jared Leto as The Joker would turn out to be silly and not so accurate. But thankfully he did a very great job. It was like a more nutty version of Heath Ledger's portrayal from ""The Dark Knight"". Margot Robbie was probably the best choice to play Harley Quinn. She was creepy, psychopathic, and crazy, but at the same time sweet and hilarious, and a lot more interesting than she usually was in the comics and the TV shows. Joel Kinnaman, Viola Davis, and Jai Courtney were also pretty good, but maybe not so amazingly great.This is the bad things of the movie: The main villain is just so uninteresting, forgettable, and boring. I actually thought it was gonna be The Joker. But nope. Instead we have a dark supernatural demon that wants to take over the world for no interesting purpose at all. The 3D was okay at some moments but at the most it was just unnecessary and bland. The characters should have had a lot more back stories.

No, even Margot Robbie did not impress me, at all. She overdoes, overplays, over-everything every singly frame and shot. In fact, her vapid delivery leaves an empty bewildered stare - why. Will Smith? Nay, too formulaic and very badly predictable. Jai Courtney? Nay, too bland and very heavily on the surface.

Nicely done new twist on old characters!,I was pleasantly surprised with the movie overall despite poor reviews. Nice short backstory on characters that mattered and well acted for the most part. Critics try to over analyze action sci-fi flicks instead of just enjoying a well done film and letting the people judge themselves. You are not watching Gone with the Wind or The Shawshank Redemption. It's a movie based on comic book characters made for adolescent adults to enjoy! Just be happy someone put this together and only hope for a sequel! If I never saw the story between Harley and The Joker continue it would be a real shame!

Exactly what it said on the tin,"For the past couple of days I've been hearing a lot of stuff about this film. I've been very excited for Suicide Squad ever since it was announced, being a bit of a DC Comics fanboy myself, and have thus been keeping up with the film regularly. For the past few days a lot of negative reviews have been thrown at this film and now, after watching it, I don't really understand where all that negativity comes from.Let me just start off by saying that if you're coming into Suicide Squad hoping to get a really deep and interesting story or to see Leto's 'Joker' then you're probably going to be disappointed. That's not to say Leto is bad, despite my fears I actually very much enjoyed Leto's portrayal of 'The Joker', it's just he isn't often present. And that's a good thing, I was genuinely concerned that Leto may take centre stage and was pleased when he didn't.The plot is probably one of the film's weakest points. This plot is a very overused plot by now and especially in superhero flicks. If you're expecting a film full of twists and turns there aren't many here. However, the lack of sophisticated plot feels both justified and adequate to me as instead we are treated to a lot of interaction between the large cast, of mainly unknown characters. I was surprised by just how much characterisation most of the characters received in this film. Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Enchantress, Rick Flag, Captain Boomerang, Katana and El Diablo all get given a glimpse of detailed backstory that helps to develop the characters, some more than others, and it surprised me. Not only is this characterisation surprising to me, but it was also done rather well in my opinion, especially with Deadshot, El Diablo and Harley.The performances in this film are actually all very solid for me. Margot Robbie had a monumental task in bringing one of DC's most beloved villains of recent years to the big screen and she pulls it off pretty perfectly. Viola Davis is a very good Amanda Waller. Will Smith pulls a good amount of weight as Deadshot and he really pulls the role off, despite my worries, all the more fool I. I enjoyed the other characters also, most receiving less screen time but all of them having their moments to shine.The visuals in this film too, are amazing. Some of the scenes with Delevingne's 'Enchantress' are simply amazing just to watch, seeing as that character visually is the most difficult to pull off with the possible exception of El Diablo. The final battle especially, for me, looked amazing. It is very rare for me nowadays to honestly come away from one of these superhero films, Marvel or DC, and say that I saw something new. However, the final battle and the visuals on the main villain really sent chills down my spine, I hadn't quite seen something so intimidating in one of these films yet and it really affected me.The only other thing I think that is worth noting on this film is that the pacing can sometimes feel a little off, especially at the beginning. Most of this I attribute to the main character's introductions and backgrounds and thus I give it a pass. I myself know each and every one of these characters well, but I perfectly understand why the introductions need to be done for those who don't know the universe as well as myself.To round off, I found 'Suicide Squad' to be an extremely enjoyable film. There is nothing truly groundbreaking here, so if that's what you're looking for you will probably be disappointed. Where the film lacks a complex plot it makes up for itself strongly with characters, a wise focus because each and every one of these villains is extremely interesting. If you're going into this film expecting Killer Croc or Katana to steal the show then also be prepared for some disappointment, as the film focuses more on Quinn and Deadshot than the lesser known characters. Regardless, 'Suicide Squad' is still a crazy, insane, fun joyride that asks you to simply sit back and enjoy the show. It's not trying to be complex, it's not trying to blow your mind, it's just trying to give you a good time and for the vast majority of the time, I was extremely content to let the film take me wherever it wanted. Ignore the reviews online and see it for yourself, as long as you sit back and relax you'll have a great time.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Overall an enjoyable experience,"Suicide Squad, although first shown as a gritty movie like its predecessors, turned out to be a genuinely fun and exciting movie filled with thrills and occasional spills. The cast had pretty good chemistry, characters interacted with one another very fluidly and pretty much everything made sense and fit together. Although the story was a bit predictable and at times stale, it made up with amazing fighting choreography and mind-blowing special effects. And the joker was legitimately one of the best jokers I have ever seen, even better than jack Nicholson's's portrayal.Overall recommend this movie to fans and casuals alike.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great Movie! don't pay attention to bought critics or marvel-fanboys,"Now I really think without any doubt that Marvel has bought critics and Marvel-fanboys are like an infection... Suicide Squad is excellent, the characters are very good and the performances are great. Will Smith is Deadshot, stunning work. Margot Robbie & Kara Delevigne are amazing, Robbie born to be Harley Quinn. And Diablo?... well DIABLO rocks!Great cast, everyone! Viola Davis, OMG! Jared Letto was a good Joker, do not compare with Ledger's Joker, this is a different Joker. Mr. Ayer you made an amazing DCEU movie!Go to watch this film, don't pay attention to bought critics or Marvel- fanboys opinions.I definitely want to see more of Suicide Squad!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A hot mess,"For the last 12 months it has been almost impossible to dodge the juggernaut of a film that is 'Suicide Squad'. It really has been everywhere. The trailers appeared to pretty much give away the entire film, and I was hoping that I was wrong and it still had a few tricks up its sleeve, however this was not the case. If you've seen the trailers you almost know the entire basic story line. This was very disappointing. Also, almost every clever one-liner (barring a few exceptions from 'Harley Quinn') was included in the trailers. Bring back the good old days of 'The Dark Knight' where the trailers were unbelievably epic, and yet gave away almost nothing of the plot.The movie itself it also a bit of a mess. There are so many characters, yet none of them are that strong. Quantity over quality never works, especially when it comes to movie characters. A breakdown of a few of the characters:Harley Quinn - undoubtedly the star of the show. Margot Robbie really impressed me in this role. She was far and away the best written character and a terrific performance made her an absolute winner. She alone pretty much carries the film and keeps some quality about it.The Joker - one of the greatest characters of all time, almost completely wasted. Did the writers understand absolutely nothing about what makes The Joker great? He's not supposed to be telling jokes, but he is certainly meant to make you laugh. Jared Leto does his best, but this part of the movie was a complete miss. Never once did he make me laugh, and never once did I find him overly menacing. A horrendously mishandled chess piece that goes a large way towards why this film is so bad. Heath Ledger must be turning in his grave.Deadshot - yuck. What an awful waste, of an already one-dimensional and useless character. His power is that he is an accurate shooter? Are you kidding me? Could there be anything more boring? Then add in that Will Smith is still trying to come across as the hero/good guy the entire movie and you have another horrible element to this film. I was really hoping Smith was going to take a leaf out of Dicaprio's book when he did 'Django Unchained'. Sadly, it's nothing like that and is simply annoying.These are the only characters really worth mentioning. The rest are purely there as filler. The DC universe is in real trouble at the moment, after the abomination that was 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice', and the reason is simple: they aren't hiring the right people to make these films. What made 'The Dark Knight' so unbelievably powerful and successful? Christopher Nolan was at the helm. Now not every film maker is capable of the standard Nolan can produce, but what irks me is that nobody is seemingly even trying to imitate what he achieved. These films are so far from what he was producing that it's ridiculous. 'Suicide Squad' has almost no story. That's unfathomable in this day and age. DC has a lot of films coming up in the near future, and unless they get a film maker on board capable of turning the tables around, they're all going to be equally as dreadful as this. It's now or never for change, but I fear they have no intention of changing.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An honest review,"Overall, I liked it a lot. For reference, I like Marvel and DC equally, and I loved BvS (and anything with Batman).The visuals were amazing, the characters were fun (although, I agree under developed), good use of music, and the fight scenes were cool.However, it was not without faults. Warner took some heat due to the run time of BvS, but the Extended Blu Ray was much better. I say, make the movie as long as it needs to be. I can deal with a 3-hour Saving Private Ryan. Also, the sub-villains, the mindless enemies they fought, just felt like they were there for target practice. They reminded me of the droids in Star Wars Episode 1. Also, I thought Leto's Joker was at times a copy of Heath. He even sounded like him a few times. I was not impressed. I've heard, however, many of his footage was cut, so I look forward to the Blu Ray. Great movie, go see it!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Freak Show of Bad Acting,"Not really an action movie, more like a carnival freak show. Put together all these oddball characters that are basically freaks, not superheroes, and you get a freaky movie.The fact that all the actors are also big stars with big egos had to make it even harder to end up with anything that resembled a good movie. It was just a gigantic explosion of everyone doing whatever they wanted to do, having fun making a bad movie.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This is the Suicide Squad!,"I was so satisfied with this movie which gave me more than jokes. I cried, I laughed and I got spooked once or twice. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! Easy to follow story....but the character development was awesome and it is the characters that drive this story. I really have nothing bad to say about it. I really don't. I liked the creativity of the movie and the look and feel of it. It is unlike any other comic book movie I have ever seen. David Ayer did it again! An urban contemporary grounded super villain film....this one has no heroes even though they do do some good in the end! If you have seen it you will know what I mean. I don't get the critics to be honest. I know where they are coming form but in no way is their logic making any sense. They have been overly critical once again and unfairly of a very good solid film. No way Ghostbusters is better than this flick. The critics have lost their minds or they have an agenda to sink the DC. The audience is going to scratch their heads after seeing this movie and wonder what the hell the critics were watching. The critics are trying to poison the waters of this innovative movie. You will see this style copied by other CBM's in the future for sure. It is a ground breaker.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Little bit disappointment but i have really enjoyed the movie,"I feel little bit disappointment but i really have enjoyed the movie. I was waiting a long time for this, but i have disappointed for the fact that the most of good scenes appears in trailers and the other movie previews. I was expecting to see more information and more scenes about the characters. Especially from Deadshot and Harley Quinn. The story was predictable but i knew that, so i focused to the actor's performance. And that was i like more on the movie. Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Jay Hernandez and Jared Leto performance was great. Music, sound effects and direction is pretty good, and all that CGI scenes make the movie interesting and enjoyable. For sure it worth to watch it. I hope will soon see and the sequel of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Worst heroes ever? More like ""worst movie ever""!","The best thing I can say about this film is that I didn't pay for it. Seriously, what a miserable experience watching this film was, and all the ultimately prevailed was feeling really sorry for the cast that despite their dedicated efforts, the movie just turned out to be completely unwatchable. Keep in mind, for the rest of the review, however, my thoughts on the films in this genre are notoriously unpopular on this board.I loved Batman v Superman and thought Civil War was complete garbage. I am getting tired of this genre, so perhaps that has something to do with it. The story here is pretty generic stuff. The final act is almost as bad as that of Ghostbusters, and the film was just as dull as Civil War. The only real saving grace was Margot Robbie, who gave the film her all, and of course also her undeniable sex appeal. Will Smith provides a very generic arc that, for fans of the TV show Arrow, we have already seen (and performed with more humanity). That show clearly isn't amazing and Season 4 is one of the worst seasons I've seen in a TV series ever, but the Deadshot in seasons 1 and 2 I found much easier to connect to. This was simply Will Smith playing Will Smith with a gun, and the character simply lacks edge. That same idea echoes throughout the film - it is so blunt and flat, with nothing of note occurring.Leto's performance is just pathetic. It is humiliating. From the outset I knew he was the wrong casting choice, and the movie proves me right beyond any reasonable doubt. His performance the whole time just misses the mark drastically. This fails to capture the essence of the Joker, and also fails to craft a compelling standalone character as Jesse Eisenberg managed to do with Lex Luthor. Here the character is reimagined as more of a drug-addled hardcore crime lord. It just doesn't work, and it is tragic to think the lengths Leto went to in his method acting to deliver what is ultimately such a tame, lame, and forgettable performance. I do hope they recast him for Batman's standalone film - him as the lead villain instantaneously knocks the film down to a maximum score of around 7/10. Thankfully he is barely in the film, although it bodes poorly for the future films in this saga.I don't think Deadpool was amazing, but it pulled off the edgier superhero film much better than this. Here it is simply grim and mean-spirited, as opposed to being cool in any vague way. This feels like a film more along those lines that was made as a dark, gritty, intense, and just completely insane action film that was later cut into a generic crowd pleaser. David Ayer claims this is his complete vision, in which case I don't know how he was ever hired, and why the making of this film is said to have been so dark and intense.The villain would be forgettable even by the standards of the MCU films. This film is so bad it feels like a failed MCU film, completely missing any distinguishing style. All we get is a muddled mess. Why not just have the Joker as villain? At least that would have been a somewhat interesting failure by the iconic nature of the character. Who cares about the Enchantress and the CGI rubbish in the finale?Overall this film was boring, tonally jarring, mean-spirited, bland, atrociously made, with editing that is amongst the most incompetent I have seen in a large budget film. Really just a complete mess. I hated this film, and it completely betrays what (to me) made BvS a memorable film in the genre. The DC universe appears to have given up trying to stand on its own and simply follow the MCU model, and attempted to make an MCU film. The story is incoherent and frankly garbage, the characters outside of Margot Robbie suck, the action is some of the weakest I've seen in a while, so blandly choreographed and just uninteresting. It is ridiculous but not self-aware enough of how ridiculous it is. It just isn't even vaguely similar to what made the trailers somewhat appealing.Recommended ONLY if you have someone who raped your girlfriend, murdered your parents, ate your dog, stole all your money, cut off all your limbs, and nuked the world, this might be an adequate way to get them back - make them sit through this film. I've called the critics biased before, and that is a sentiment I maintain entirely, although they are 100% right here, particularly Travers who nailed it.Stay away. You have been warned.1/10.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
On why I loved the flawed movie anyway,"The movie wasn't perfect by any means; yes, the story was not so well executed; pacing regarding character development a bit unsteady; plot plain; but what I loved the most watching the movie was the chemistry between the cast so that I had no problem enjoying the movie from the beginning to the end.Also style concept of the whole movie was great just as the costumes, and as much as I love Margot Robbie and her face for Harley Quinn, no one will top the casting choice for Amanda Waller. Viola Davis brought her straight into real life from the comics.I was bothered though that Warner Brothers missed the opportunity to show a great Joker by Jared Leto. I've seen the behind the scenes and I've seen Jared was giving a good Joker-performance backstage, but that's it. He had potential and now receives the hate he does not deserve simply because the production messed up.All in all, the modern and more realistic streetstyle take of Harley and Joker was, to me, a great idea and I had wished to see more of that in future movies. I also wasn't bothered at all by the romance between Harley and Joker as I see this just as another universe out of a dozen DC had come up with. It's an interesting 'what if' scenario after all and the extra scenes of their past matches the original story in some kinda way.Ps.: Katana felt like a not needed accessory though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"I didn't heed the warnings, and I wish I did.","They say that most of Jared Leto's scenes were left on the cutting-room floor. That's the good news.And that's as humorous as I can be about this.

I don't want to throw gas on the fire here, but the quicker I can forget about this Hot Topic DC movie, the better.It's godawful.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
NO!,"In general, it was a meaningless film. The joker character was included in the blank film. However, it had a very simple structure. In general, there was a stupidly designed scenario.

Release Directors cut,"(here after watching The Suicide Squad)As David Ayer said :""The studio cut is not my movie. Read that again,"" he wrote. ""And my cut is not the 10 week director's cut - It's a fully mature edit by Lee Smith standing on the incredibly work by John Gilroy. It's all Steven Price's brilliant score, with not a single radio song in the whole thing.

"Margot Robbie shines. Rest of the film, not so much.","*sigh* Two words that describe this film. Missed opportunities.This movie should never have been made for PG-13, but R rating. But because it has been made for kids, this movie, and all that it could have achieved, is a huge wasted opportunity of gigantic proportions. Marvel was also hesitant to make Deadpool with R-rating, but they finally did, and it payed off.I hate all the mistakes DC are making these days. I grew up with batman and superman comics in the 80's and 90's, so it hurts when i see them treat their own material this way.Margot Robbie is the star of this film, she steals all the attention in every scene she is in, and i can not but imagine what she could have done with this character if it was not a movie for kids. A huge contrast to the rest of the cast assemble which has too little to do, and they are to many, so we don't ever get to like or dislike any of them. To top it off, the joker has far to few scenes in this film, which is a shame. Jared Leto plays a solid mad joker.And as i predicted before the movie came out, was that David Ayer would yet again fail. He and Fuqua both, are riding on the success they had with ""Training Day"", and IMO none of them have directed a good movie since then. Ayer is not a good story teller, he is good at blending action with CGI, which this movie could of had a lot less and rather spend time on the story. His direction, combined with a weak story, and combined with PG-13, disaster happens.And this is a movie that was so hyped as well. This was the one film DC had to do right, to prove they had it in them. The Marvel movie that kind of compare to this is ""Guardians of the galaxy"". And what Marvel did right was to give all the characters a unique and special personality, making it easier to recognize and care for them, which then made it a good movie. Here in ""Suicide squad"" we just have an outstanding Margot Robbie with a bunch of ""others"". Which is a damn shame.I heard before i saw the film that a lot of the Jokers scenes were cut out of the film before the final cut, i haven't read more into it. But The Joker had way to few scenes in this film, maybe the other scenes they had to remove weren't PG-13 friendly.*sigh* Why DC?. WHY?Is it so damn hard to make a R rated movie now and then? With an R rating, this movie would have dared to be as violent as it has to be with this assemble of anti heroes. The Joker can go full ballistic, Harley Quinn can be even more daring, The language even more naughty and provoking. It is all the movie needed to be decent or even good. But DC didn't have the brass balls needed to pull it off.Therefor just a big pile of missed opportunities.4/10 - Very Disappointing",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Fun movie to watch; DC's attempts to kind of mimic Marvel?,"I have watched this film 4 days ahead of its release at Regal Fenway, Boston (Thanks to Warner Brothers Invitation).This is a fast paced, comic and CGI filled movie. The character introduction is well done. Will Smith, Margot Robbie steal the show. The story is ""Assembling a bunch of bad guys against a super villain whose motive is to wipe off the earth"". (Story of Avengers 1, Avengers 2, Batman, etc). There is nothing new about the story, but the director David Ayer did a great job introducing the characters and building the story.Poor characterization, some poor dialogues and erratic screenplay are the side effects of a week story line. Except Deadshot, Harley Quinn and Diablo, the other characters seemed to be underdeveloped.The Good: - Jai courney as the Boomerang was a great comic relief and he reminds us of DCs attempts to include comedy in their apparent Dark and gritty films. - Diablo was fun to watch, though some things at the end of the movie regarding this character are un explained. - Great directing within the constrains of the story. - Fantastic lead by Will SmithThe Bad - Poor CGI - Villain(s) with poor motive - Viola Davis' poor characterization - Wrong timing for comedy. - You clearly see the audience and critics making an impact on the film. DC was blamed for being too dark unlike marvel and you can see the screen writers deliberately including funny one liners in un- necessary scenes.Overall, it is a great summer film. If you step into the movie hall with less or zero expectations (like me) you are going to have fun.Special mention about the Joker.Jared Leto: The method actor who underwent a lot of physical and mental training is put down as he gets less screen time to show his skills off. It was reported that Jared Leto shut himself from the world and completely transformed into the role of Joker. Will Smith also admitted he never got to know the real actor behind.

This was very clearly a mixup of every superhero movie stereotype possible, and it didn't work. It could have worked, but it didn't, and I'm as disappointed as the next guy. It was a complete mess of tropes, misused plot devices and characters with no depth. The most disappointing thing about this movie, honestly, is how bad it is. It's not funny bad. It's pitifully bad. It's an uninspired mess who's only light is it's characters, none of who are given enough screen time or good writing to make completely work, despite great acting by Will Smith, Margot Robbie, and Jay Hernandes, among others.

Fun movie. Worth the price of entry. Better than what it's being bashed for,Honestly. You should go watch it for yourself and decide yourself. The movie seems to be very decisive. Me personally. I loved it. It was fun. It had heart. And the action and soundtrack was riveting. The story could have been better but as far as a superhero movies goes. It's on par with the usual. Evil wants to take over. And a group of rag heroes or anti heroes in this case has to stop it. Nothing overly complex. But most superhero movies really aren't. Great cast that seem to engage well with each other. Good cgi. I'll definitely watch it again. And I really hope for a sequel. The possibilities are quite interesting with this story line.But I've seen some reviews completely bashing this movie for doing things that any other movie gets praised for. You'd have to be a fool to think the story was too messy to understand. It was straight forward. Editing was a bit choppy in the middle but nothing that puts you off the movie. And people don't seem to know how the rating system works. Giving it 1 star in the hopes of just bringing down the score. When it's obvious this movie doesn't deserve anywhere near 1 star. This isn't the avatar the last air bender movie. Sad really considering this movie is definitely worth the price of a ticket. And it has the necessities of an above average summer blockbuster. Go watch it and decide for yourself.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
not what was expected but not a bad film,"My review (minor spoilers)Overall the expectations I went in with were probably higher than they should have been. The narrative and overall plot were very difficult to follow. Like Batman v Superman, it wasn't a bad film in its own right but there were many plot points which could have been elaborated on. I figured there would be more humour but there isn't.Harley Quinn deserved more of a backstory. It was faithful to the comics but they rushed her transition from lonely psychiatrist to anarchist. It's a very compelling story of the psychiatrist attempting to turn the inmate sane but the inmate turning the tables and turning the psychiatrist insane. So much so I think there was enough material to make a Joker/Harley film on its own (though I guess a prequel could be still in the cards). Still for what we got, Harley Quinn was very well played and she definitely resembled her comic counterpart.Will Smith ends up stealing the show from Harley. He's more intimidating and frankly more dangerous given his combat skills. The only part of the character I didn't like was having the hardened criminal with the daughter he aims to please is getting rather cliché. Still Smith himself nails his role. Harley is separated from the Joker for most of the film and so Deadshot ends up her grounding rod for most of the film. The brief scene with Batman and Deadshot did have surprisingly good chemistry.Affleck got four scenes. Three as Batman, one as Bruce Wayne. He didn't have a lot to work with but did a good job with what he had. I feel it's premature and unfair to compare Leto to the other Jokers. The Joker doesn't have a lot of screen time and most of it is in flashbacks or dream sequences so there wasn't much room for character development.Viola Davis may have ended up as the unsung hero with honourable mention to Joel Kinnaman. I was heavily reminded of the Nick Fury/Phil Coulson relationship from the Avengers. Without spoiling any plot points, the two use similar plot points to motivate the team.Overall it was a very enjoyable film. The stakes are always high when you have super criminals on the loose. I am hoping for more films with these characters, particularly Deadshot and Harley. I think the reason people feel underwhelmed is that it may not have met their expectations. Expecting a humour packed film of bad guys doing bad things for an entire film was unrealistic. The first act was the strongest with the characters being introduced, the second act definitely stalls and suffers as if the film wanders aimlessly wondering what to do next but the third act redeems the film.It ends in a way in which there aren't necessarily unresolved cliffhangers but it does open up for a world of more films and excitement on what happens next.

Well Executed (no pun intended),"I will start out with the fact that I am not a huge comic book fan. I have had friends growing up who are super into comic books and who would give me the run down on each super hero movie coming out. I do, however, enjoy a well made Marvel or DC movie that keeps me entertained and throws a curve ball at some point in the movie. Unfortunately, many comic book movies, whether you've read the comics or not, tend to be very predictable. Suicide Squad, however, was unusual in this aspect. It seemed that the movie kept you on the edge of your seat so often, that there was no time for predicting. I believe this movie appealed to the artsy crowd with it's variety of colors and unique animation techniques. That was one thing that stood out to me. And as for the ever-pressing Joker argument... Jared Leto did play an incredibly creepy and uncomfortable Joker. Nonetheless, I do not think anyone will ever surpass the performance put on by Heath Ledger. Leto did well considering what he had to follow up, and perhaps he played a better ""comic- book-Joker,"" but Ledger will forever remain the best Joker in my books. All in all a well written screenplay and well executed plot, with fun characters from Will Smith's Deadshot and Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn.

Short & spoiler free review by a casual viewer,"Disclaimer: I haven't read any of the comics, I just enjoy superhero (in this case - villain) movies. So I can't compare these characters to the original ones.Pros of this movie:1.The visual effects are amazing 2.The soundtrack is great 3.The movie is fun 4.The action sequences are great 5.I liked almost all of the characters (on the ones I didn't - scroll down) 6.Leto is a good Joker. He is different, but I really liked him. I'm glad he was only in the movie for a short while. It's all I needed - I can't wait to see him in future DC films! 7.Good female characters. Sure, Harley could've used a bit more practical clothing, but I honestly didn't feel like she was over sexualized. She's sexy and she knows it and uses it to get a reaction out of people. This movie gives us multiple badass female characters, each different from the other, so why not add someone like this Harley in the mix?Cons of this movie: 1.Slipknot. How did that actor agree to do this movie lmao 2.Enchantress. Boring and unbelievable. 3.The Villain. The usual villain we get in superhero movies. Almost bluefaced and kinda robotic + pretty boring. 4.The dialogue is a bit cheesy at times and some of the characters' reactions seem unrealistic 5.The ending's lameIn conclusion - more than anything the movie's fun. And it made me excited for what else DC has to offer. So I do recommend watching it, just don't expect to be mindblown.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Great Characters, Stale Plot.","Great characters, but a stale and redundant plot line. Will Smith and Margot Robbie take front stage with crowd pleasing, magnetic characters.. while Jared Leto's role of the Joker is minimized and rarely seen throughout the entire movie. The movie was over-hyped, also strangely enough--scenes from the trailers we not shown in the movie.In regards to the stale plot, the plot reminded me of similar scenarios in X-men and Avengers... also the ""twists"" and ""turns"" in the movie are anything but a surprise.

Good fun popcorn flick,Suicide Squad is a great action packed fun popcorn movie. The critics out there that are expecting a cinematic masterpiece from a come book film should not be critics. As David Ayer (Director) has stated he made this film for the fans and I believe if you are a fan of comic book films and a DC fan you will really enjoy this film. Margot Robbie stole the spotlight in the film with other great actors like Will smith and Jai Courtney were also very good. Jarrod Leto's Joker was different but still very good. The story is plain and simple which is what the film needed with such a large cast and the villain was a great choice. If you enjoy a good action film with interesting characters you will enjoy this film.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Cool movie,"I really did enjoy watching this movie. Had a great start and then.... there are some parts did have some consistency issues. Some great action scenes and others were just bad. In my opinion the main issue was the editing and some characters consistency. Overall I really did enjoyed it. Perhaps a directors edition later on?? But yes much more entertaining than Batman vs Superman, but still has to grow more to be able to face marvel movies, but they are on the right track. The soundtrack is also an issue here. In some parts it's great and in others is.... like I don't know what there were thinking about. The soundtrack is on the line of the Guardians of the Galaxy, and in general I liked it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""Suicide Squad"" made me wanna hang myself...","I'm not a fan of superhero films in general (a handful of exceptions do exist), but I was feeling (stupidly) optimistic for Suicide Squad. I went with my friends to see it, and while they admired parts of it and were able to have a good laugh about it, I couldn't. I didn't enjoy one second of the two hours I was in that seat. My eyes eventually began to water...I was the only person in the theater who didn't enjoy it.Everything about the film felt fragmented, and whether or not that was the intention is irrelevant to me, because I wouldn't have liked it either way. The soundtrack consists almost entirely of hit songs... clichéd songs (songs that I actually love by themselves).The acting wasn't bad at all, but it always felt odd and off. I'm not doubting the talent of this cast because I've seen just about all of them play an amazing role elsewhere. I don't even want to get started on the humor. I'm no prude when it comes to comedy, but for the entire two hours of run time, I didn't even crack a smile. To me, the most entertaining part was my buddy quietly singing along to the songs as he set beside me, wholly immersed.Action scenes were typical, predictable, and not very creative; just typical superhero movie fight scenes. As a whole, the film is so predictable that you could probably guess what's going to happen scene-by-scene as the story progresses.As mentioned previously, this movie was so boring. Had I gone by myself, I would have definitely walked out probably the halfway point. I didn't feel invested. I didn't feel interested. I felt absolutely nothing.You might be wondering as to why I gave SS a bonus star. It definitely tried, and I recognize a lot of the talent and effort that went into some of the special effects and makeup. I really couldn't give it much credit for anything else. The bonus star is for the production. Unimpressive, movie.I know there are many people who also despise this movie, but it's in all honesty a very polarizing piece. You have to see it to make an actual decision, but I can certainly tell you where I stand. If you enjoyed it, kudos to you. I simply couldn't, despite really, really wanting to. Ten minutes in, my mind just gave up, and I sat there like a vegetable for the remaining one-hundred and ten.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Garbage!,"Total waste of space. Further more, a real insult to the comic fans to see their well honed characters in such distorted on-screen characterisations. There has been almost no regard to the source material. The director is armature at best, clumsy and messy most of the time. The only good scene was added by Zack Snyder which stood heads and shoulders above this mediocre film. Avoid. The cast was generally good, though I thought Will Smith looked and sounded like the fresh prince on a Halloween Night special.

Not looking so bad now,"When this movie came out I had a job selling ""Suicide Squad"" T-Shirts in a theatre showing it. I would see the crowd come in all excited and then leave 2 hours later sadly disappointed. I never went to see it on the big screen. Instead, I waited for Cable. (and he was great in DEADPOOL 2) So when I finally saw ""Suicide Squad"" I was surprised. Sure it wasn't great, but it wasn't the steaming pile of stuff everyone said it was. Will smith did enough to be paid, Cara Delveingne wiggled, and Margot Robbie proved she had the charisma to hold the audiences attention facing the camera or not. Would I tell you to pay $15 to see this film? Not really. But if you're home one day and it's on TNT or TBS stop and take another look.

Squardonnnnnnnnnn,"The chemistry between the characters are great, as well as the development between their relationship. in my opinion, one of the strongest chemistry is Harley Quinn and Deadshot. Their chemistry is electric, funny, and watching them teasing, and slowly started to care about each other, is entertaining, and make me ship them together. even, i have a relationship that had a weak chemistry, that is Rick Flagg and June Moore's relationship which is bland, forced, and unnecessary.Now, parts that i think is the weak part of the movie, I think the plot is the main reason. The plot is lazy-written and under- developed,and at some point is pretty ridiculous. i don't want to get into it too much, since it will spoil some things, and i need you to watch the movie without spoilers, yet. even, i could tell you that the CGI is pretty cringy and sometimes, so does the visual effect between the scenes. the ending is actually rushed, predictable, and i think they could do better after building up the story of the fight scene.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A good soundtrack trying to cover a messy script.,"6/10. A film based on a DC Comic in which we see a group of criminals recruited to take down what no normal person can. Off the bat I would recommend the soundtrack, although a lot of very cool songs put together to try and improve on a messy script and story. Directer David Ayer does quite a good job of showing you and introducing you to who the suicide squad are, but doesn't seem to know what to do with them after that. Will Smith as Deadshot does a fine job as expected by him. Jared Leto is an effective Joker, I actually liked his manner and was creeped out by his laugh, unfortunately he is only a side character and not the big bad. But Margot Robbie steals the show as Harley Quinn, with a superb job. The origin story of how she came about was one of the better parts of the film. Action was OK but a bit lacking. The villain was just boring and didn't seem to have any purpose. Overall a little disappointed but some good acting and a few good scenes pushed this to a 6, which means it was better than BVS, but only just. I really hope DC pulls their socks up.

Garbage,"Sloppy scene structure doesn't make good movies. Unconventional characters alone don't make good movies. Bad directing, bad editing, bad CGI, bad acting. If a film fails on every aspect but still is by all means successful, what does that say about it's audience. Lets stop making terrible movies. One-liner, one-dimensional characters with no depth beyond the label of ""bad"", ""evil"", ""crazy"" fill this movie, as a surprisingly congested script attempts to give them backstory. Although comedy is very subjective, jokes in addition to the majority of the dialogue in general is very cringe-worthy. I felt embarrassed whenever anyone spoke. It all make me want to commit suicide squad.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Don't listen to critics or anyone else, see for yourself","To all those who prefer a dark tone in movies with some humor, this one would not disappoint. I still don't understand why so much hate from critics again. Are they trying to stop DC from making movies; if that's the case that ain't going to stop. I loved both MOS & BVS, this one is also kick-ass. Packed with lots of action sequences and humor and cameos, its an absolute fun movie. Yes, it does have a different approach than BVS but both are great in their own ways. David Ayer as the director was so cool. Soundtrack and Score was awesome.Now speaking of the performances, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is jaw dropping. She alone is the reason enough to watch this film. Will Smith is just fantastic. Jared Leto made another iconic Joker performance but he should've had more screen time. Leto's joker is good but not better than Heath's as set up a high bar in terms of performance. Amanda Waller was a mean scary agent and that's a good point as it was needed to bring the bad guys together.Batfleck is always fun to watch. The Flash cameo was cool too.Killer Croc, El Diablo, Rick Flag, Katana, Cap Boomerang; all were good. And Slipknot - why was he there even in the first place???And as it goes for the critics, Rick Flag's got a few words ""seriously, what the hell is wrong with you people?"" - to which their answer is ""we're the worse guys, we rate DC movies as BAD"".... SERIOUSLY!Overall: the movie is good. Could've had more run time as its an hour less than BVS ultimate cut, and some more joker in it but its still a fun watch anyways.

Half Baked,"The DC Universe has only begun its unveiling. Do you think what lies ahead is promising if the 2016 releases are of any indication of what is in store for us?First it was ""The Bat"" taking on the ""Son of Krypton"" in a disputably excessive run time (Although the DC Universe has a lot of groundwork to set up for the 2017 line up).Second – SUICIDE SQUAD!Deadshot (Will Smith) wants to be the only villain of Gotham City. Trapped between the greed of power to reign as the Alpha in Gotham, and the tears of his daughter, he is apprehended by Batman and is incarcerated. Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) & Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) employed by a secret government agency are attempting to recruit Deadshot, Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and Slipknot (Adam Beach) to run secret black-ops missions as deniable assets for the agency. This team of supervillains are assembled sooner than foreseen when yet another asset escapes and goes rouge creating havoc across the city. The Irony of all this – the asset that goes rouge, is none other than June Moone (Cara Delevingne) the lover of team leader Rick Flag. In terms of a plot, there is absolutely too much going on already and The Joker (Jared Leto) is not even in the picture yet.Directed & Written by David Ayer SUICIDE SQUAD is a half-baked visual marvel. It has everything that a superhero/supervillain movie should have in the department of its original soundtrack, the CGI, makeup and costuming. What baffles me is the fact of what Warner Bros was thinking when the screenplay was initially approved for production? At least with the Marvel Franchises the backstories were clearly laid for each character prior to the Assembly, The Bat Vs SM too can be excused since Nolan and Snyder told the story before. Unless you grew up reading every single comic book, you will be lost in this debacle of a screenplay.The writing is in shambles but David Ayer and his cast certainly didn't take a knife to a gun fight. They gear up, cover up most of the loopholes and punch their way through. Even absolutely short-lived, the Jared Leto performance is Gold. Don't bat your eyes or the joker will be gone! If the character was written better, his performance would have made an AA nod in 2017, but with this screenplay its unlikely.The elephant in the room? Will Smith? Let's agree that he is the money man aka ""The Face"" for this blockbuster. Would it have been better to star someone else? No, Will Smith does it alright. A noteworthy performance on the other hand, falling behind Leto, is Margot Robbie, every second of her Harley is entertaining, enthusiastic and authentic, seems like she did a lot of research to pull this one off on such a high level. How I hope for a standalone movie of Harley and her pudding.Fanboys will be excited. New to the genre? Best read up on your comics. You may find a ring tone for your phone too.TITLE: SUICIDE SQUAD DIRECTED BY: David AYER STARRING: WILL SMITH, VIOLA DAVIS, JOEL KINNAMAN, MARGOT ROBBIE, JAI COURTNEY, JAY HERNANDEZ, ADEWALE AKINNUOYE-AGBAJE, ADAM BEACH, CARA DELVINGNE, KAREN FUKUHARA & JARED LETO RATED: PG13 RATING: 06/10 RUNTIME: 123 MINUTES",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A flawed film with characters that work,"Before the wreck that was Batman v Superman happened I was rather extremely hopeful on this movie, and it was the one film I was anticipating more than Batman v Superman. I have always adored the Harley Quinn character and what Bruce Timm and Paul Dini did with her. I am also a huge Deadshot and while I didn't think Will Smith was the best choice for Deadshot I was still intrigued with what the actor could bring to the table.And then Batman v Superman came out and it was a huge disappointment and tampered my anticipation for Suicide Squad. Also the fact that in the marketing they were pushing all the musical cues my way also hurt my anticipation for the film overall. But with all the my hopes and dreams being dashed by a rocky start for DC and a bunch of trailers feeling more like music videos than actual trailers I did come out of this film liking it quite a lot.Now from top to bottom this movie is cliché. We get a really boring villain that you have seen in every Marvel film and you have a team of characters having to stop this villain from destroying the world. That piece of the movie is very standard and something we have seen being done over and over again endlessly.However this film makes up for those clichés with its characters that are really all quite something to fall in love with. Rather its Killer Croc's one liners, Deadshot's love for his daughter, Harley Quinn's love for the Joker, and the Joker's overall insanity everyone has something interesting to add to this film. This makes the film a lot more fun and a lot more easier to get through. The comedy is great as I found myself laughing a lot throughout my first screening of the film and it all just works on all cylinders.If you are a fan of these types of films with super powered characters then I think you will defiantly enjoy Suicide Squad quite a bit. It brings some light hearted enjoyment to the dark and gross DC cinematic universe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Worst movie ever.,"I watched Suicide Squad (2016) and it was the worst movie I have ever seen. There were jokes every 2 seconds which weren't even funny I chuckled at 2 of them. For the whole movie we don't know the villains motives. The Joker and Harley Quinn actually have a stable relationship which the whole point of there relationship is Joker is supposed to not care for Harley and just use her. 1 character was just used to be killed off and 2 other characters were there for no reason the contributed nothing. This one character was not interesting but was there for most of the movie. Jared Leto's Joker performance is really weird and stupid. Most of the movie is boring. The only good part was all the songs put in it. The movie is all around crap, worst movie ever. I rate it 0.5/10.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
it is like a zombie movie...,"Well... I think Suicide Squad is a new kind of movie. It's like Fantastic Four + Deadpool + Zombie Movie. Zombie? YES. It's like a special force was sent to a city with zombie apocalypse. Nice experience but don't be over-hyped. This movie is okay, but not really good. If you remember, MoS and BvS was controversial, some people said that DCEU was over, but I think Suicide Squad save it. This movie will be not controversial as MoS/BvS, because it's okay, it's entertaining, unique, maybe the first DCEU movie with positive reviews.Positive things : 1. This is a new kind of movie, nice experience 2. Superb action scenes 3. Harley Quin is amazing 4. Overall more entertaining than BvS/MoSNegative things : 1.

I Was Worried About This Film - And I Was Right,"First, I had never heard of the Suicide Squad before this film was announced, but that's not necessarily bad as I had not heard of Guardians of the Galaxy either, and that film was outstanding.I had a bad feeling about this film, so much hype normally means the studio is trying too hard to publicize it to make up for a bad film. But a buddy talked me into going, so I did. I was very disappointed to say the least.Without giving away any spoilers on plot, the characters just do not gel - no charisma between them at all. Margot was the best of the group, but even her character became irritating after a while. I found it hard to root for any of the characters in this film, good guy or bad, as it would not have mattered if every character lived or died. Each character would have a moment that was interesting, then poof, it was gone. Even Leto's performance was a ""Wow"", then ""Meh"", then confusing. What a mishmash - no flow or continuity at all.Then there is the special effects. I felt like I was watching a movie from the 90s the CGI was that bad. For an action movie with characters like this, the film gets an overwhelming failing grade on effects.For a popcorn movie, it is not completely horrible - but as a comic book movie in today's world, it was just awful - much worse than Batman v Superman.Rating is a 2/10. For this type of movie, you must have either top notch special effects or a first rate script and this film had neither. The only reason it gets a 2 is that some of the action sequences were decent, but certainly not enough to carry this film.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Guardians of the Galaxy-like fun hits all the right keys, just not in the right order to gain access to greatness","It's now two days until my birthday, and I really wanted Suicide Squad to be my early birthday dream come true. What I got was not as bad as all the critics have been saying, but at the same time it just feels like it misses the mark somehow.First of all, let's deal with the obvious: this film is basically DC's answer to Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. Both have criminals band together to face a powerful enemy (both with a combination of swords and guns), both use classic pop and rock songs, and both end up establishing the direction of their respective universes.So the music, in the trailers for this movie, the editing acumen to meld action with music was nothing short of genius, but in the finished product, while all the songs are good, they come up so often,so unnecessarily, and sometimes as a very odd choice. Literally, Bohemian Rhapsody plays at the very end for no reason at all over the exact footage of the second trailer.Moving on, though, this film is not necessarily about the action, of which there is plenty of but you doesn't really engage you. It's about the chemistry between the cast, and they fall in three categories.The breakout stars of this film, Will Smith's Deadshot, Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn, and Jared Leto's Joker, all steal the show in every scene they appear (of which, Joker appears much less than you might think). In short, Suicide Squad is basically all about these three, the rest of the cast just supports them.Then there are the perfectly competent characters who are there and make for great action sequences. Chief among these are Diablo, played by Jay Hernandez, and Katana, played by Karen Fukuhara. Viola Davis' Amanda Waller is meant to be a chief player in this film, and in all honesty she pulls off her performance wonderfully, but her lack of screen-time in much of the film's action leaves her just shy of making the first tier.Finally, there's the characters who were either supposed to be important but really aren't and those who are incredibly forgettable. Case in point: the relationship between Special Forces officer Rick Flag, played by Joel Kinnaman, and June Moone/Enchantress, played by Cara Delevingne, is supposed to be one of torn emotions between saving their love or saving the world, but when it all plays out the resolution does not feel satisfying. Also, Jai Courtney's Captain Boomerang's only cool moment is him sipping a beer during an intense firefight.In summary, let me say that this film is NOT as bad as the critics say it is. They lambaste the poor editing, shallow characters, and rushed pace, and while there is ground for criticism in these ares, Suicide Squad delivers more than enough thrills and laughs to make the price of admission worth it. If I were to change one thing, though: I would go back in time and tell the marketing department to not give away so much of the film in the trailers, because really a TON of stuff in the trailers basically sums up the movie and there's not as much left to find out in the theater.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
** May Contain a little bit of spoilers **,"This is just what I was hoping for in since I saw the first trailer a year ago. It didn't disappoint. People are trying to compare this to Marvel films where they have had years of putting the back-story of each character. Jared Leto was exceptional as the Joker, he brought HIS Joker and left the rest behind. There was just NOT enough of him in the movie but the scenes he was in were exceptional. Cant wait for the next movies with him as the Joker. Margot Robbie was just the perfect Harley Quinn, she played the Jokers on/off again girlfriend psychotic perfectly. She nailed it! Will Smith was perfect as Dead Shot and the leader of the group, I loved Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje role as Killer Croq. He had just the best lines. I just fell in love with him. Didn't see enough of Kevin Eastwood. Cara Delevingne did just a fantastic job for her 1st time on the big screen. Loved Karen Fukuhara as well. The funniest was Jai Courtney and this bad-ass who likes stuffed unicorns.This is by far the best film to see over the summer. Even twice so you can see what you missed the 1st time. So many Easter Eggs you miss the 1st time. AND there will be a sequel as you need to stay after the closing scene.

It is definitely miles ahead of BVS.The cast had good chemistry and this spawned amazing performances by Viola, Jared, Margot and Will, in that specific order.

True Review. No Bias. No Bulls***,"Firstly I am one of the many fans out there who have been waiting for 18 months now to finally see this flick.I tried, tried then tried some more to not read the reviews yesterday but it was to no avail.Although i always go in fresh my heart sunk at the total negative reviews.NOW Don't THINK ""THIS GUY IS MARVEL"". I am and have always been DC but this is yet another attempt to make a DC movie using a director that just isn't built for an epic Nolan type filmWe saw a midnight screening last night here in Australia. The first 20 minutes were entertaining in warming you up to the characters however the overuse of songs were a real distraction. Seemed every camera change had another song playing. Unlike Guardians though this soundtrack had no continuity. From 70's disco to 80's rock ballads to white boy rap..... and this was all in the space of 2 minutes!!!As the 2nd act started i thought to myself the movie is rather good however my fears did arrive very quickly.We found ourselves asking each other ""did we miss something??"".There was no information given to the audience as to where our SS were going and what their goal was. After a drawn out repetitive fight scene we understand the goal once finally told to us.There seemed to be no second act as we realized this film completely skips it and goes straight from act 1 to an act 3 which drags on and on.I cannot understand how a movie with so many executives could allow this to happen with the amount of editing time this film had.I guess they thought ""lets just take the audience's money and try and improve on the next one""The plot and story were either not there to begin with or cut out in editing.It was fun but also a little too corny for my liking with only Will and Margot having a few shine moments and the Joker just laughing a lot when i guess Leto couldn't figure out how to act a certain scene.I am re-watching this afternoon to see if i missed anything however from talking to the mates I unfortunately have to agree with most of the critics reviews.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An excellent joy ride - with a few bumps.,"Suicide Squad was sailing on an ocean of high expectations after the disappoint which was given by Batman v Superman. So it's only natural for many to think that this movie was not good enough. (Although being a Marvel fan. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie)The movie had a very nice blend of comedy with gruesome seriousness. It gave a good competition to the other CBM's that have released this past year, but just fail to top the charts. Since the trailers had dropped, the good thing that David Ayer kept in mind was not to reveal any plot line to the public, as many people had lost their minds after what BvS had done.There are tons of lighthearted moments delivered by all the characters. Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Viola Davis, Jai Courtney, Jay Hernandez, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Cara Delevingne and Joel Kinnaman all had done a brilliant job in their respective roles. The man to fill in big shoes was Jared Leto. And personally I found him to be a better Joker than his predecessor, Heath Ledger.All in all, this movie could've definitely been much much better given the characters and the universe it is involved in. They could've made more use of the characters, made the run time of the movie a little longer, and given a more elaborate build up to the villain.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A (new) DC disappointment,"I was curious about this film, as a DC fan. The film belongs to the DC world and is a continuation of the last movie - Batman V Superman. That's why I did have the feeling to watch a series, not a movie. Too many characters tucked in barely two hours of film, however, can not be given to everyone as individuals. Most space (or time) are expected to get Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Will Smith as Deadshot, others are gathered crumbs and are presented in retrospectives. Joker I can not like, definitely the worst Joker in history. Too much they tried to squeeze in a film so that a slurry is full of ingredients, but the mixture was not good. The film is incomplete, with a bad story, at times too much CGI effects. If you disallow the brain, maybe you like it or you at least have a little fun.

(SPOILER FREE)Amazing. Ignore critics.,"First, i think something is up, critic ratings are mediocre, audience is good, 8.5 out of 6,000 reviews from audience. Its set up, this movie is fantastic. Will Smith (Deadshot) and Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn) are great. But Cara Delevingnes Enchantress is the ultimate ""adversary"" . She is beautiful and her acting is so well done. The story is great, the third act is a little bit screwy, but has a great finale. A bit messy to be honest, but in all a fun roller-coaster from start to finish. The casting, pacing, acting, story, and fun factor are all there and well. Its a summer blockbuster at its best. I would extremely recommend watching this. Best Dc movie since Dark Knight.

best movie released this year,i am really confused why the critics writing about how a terrible movie suicide squad is. well guess what ? the movie was amazing i had a great time and the cast did an amazing job (except for Cara didn't her acting was a little bit poor ) the only thing that bugged me the lack of the joker scenes but Leto did an amazing job! perhaps the critics are huge Marvel fans . don't listen to the critics the movie was amazing.they are the same critics who said that the witch was an amazing movie while it was really a mess. and i have to admit DC made a wonderful job with this movie (i'm a Marvel fan) SQ was much better than Batman VS Superman .,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
That was a disappointment...,"I was expecting really long time to watch Suicide Squad, since the very first rumours actually, and I had high expectations about it. I don't wanna accept this, but it was a big disappointment...The plot was not even close to successful. Such a huge mess. Pulling it a bit of here and there in order to make - again - an incomplete story. After Jack Nicholson's and Heath Ledger's Jokers, there is obviously a burden to take the role of this terrific villain. But Jared Leto did not even touched the hero's disturbed psychology and character in my opinion. It was all too contrived. The movie's poster was already to kitsch for me, but I thought that they just wanted to give it a little bit of ""comics"" aesthetic. The graphics in the very beginning of the movie, during the presentation of the Suicide Squad were such a bad-taste. Enchantress' appearance in the movie was something I was really looking forward to, 'cause she is a villain that not many people know about. Since she is named ""Enchantress"" of course there's gonna be a supernatural element to it, BUT, making her the main villain of the movie and everything turning around that element was a big failure to me.Although I feel that Margot Robbie's and Viola Davis's acting skills really saved the day - I never expected cold-blooded b***h Amanda Waller becoming one of my favorites - I found Margot Robbie's acting really ""too much"" at some points, but on the other hand, that's what Harley Quinn is, right?The connections to ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" as well as Ben Affleck's and Ezra Miller's cameos - as Batman and Flash respectively - were a pleasant surprise and were a plus for me. The only reason I gave a high rating, regarding what I actually watched and what I expected to watch, was just because of Viola Davis and Margot Robbie...",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This movie was sadly disappointing for a comic fan,"Dead shot is one of the greatest batman villains of all time. This movie turned him into a pimp with a heart. That hat, are you kidding. Why ruin an established villain? Create a new wise cracking hip hop villain. Pathetic. Will Smith, why? I thought America was done with that embarrassment and his family.Harlequin is pretty good. Don't know if Leto was a good joker, he was hardly in it.Killer croc looked good and that's all.All the other villains were forgettable.Fighting scenes were terrible, it was like they were fighting on a stage.Enchantress animation was so bad it was...

"Ignore the critics. If you're interested at least one bit, go see it You won't regret it.","My expectations were very high and this was my most anticipated movie of the year. I've been waiting for it for more than a year. And now it's finally here. And it was well worth the wait.Some critics call it worse than Green Lantern and last year's Fantastic Four. Well, that's where critics become haters because any person who says that is crazier than Harley Quinn. This movie ISN'T that bad. In fact, if you're a fan, you will love it. If you don't know much about the source material or DC Comics in general, the least you will think is that it was fun. Think Guardians of the Galaxy, DC version. Without space or aliens. And it's got an awesome soundtrack too. The critics say both that the plot is thin and that it's overstuffed. Just there you can see that they are just nitpicking. I'll be honest, the plot IS thin, but like the plot of The Avengers isn't. And yet, no one mentioned that. And it's still a good movie (to me not as good as everyone says, but okay). And this is even better. At least it is to me. It kinda depends if you like DC or Marvel more. But still, if you prefer Marvel, you will think this was at the very least entertaining. There were clearly some disagreements between the director and the studio because the studio wanted a more light-hearted and funnier movie, while Ayer wanted it to be darker and it isn't very well balanced and that's the reason why the movie feels choppy at times. The first half is full of dark humor and while there is some over- exposition, it sets up the characters very well. The second half is a bit more serious, but that was necessary to add some more emotional weight to everything. Maybe it does seem gloomy at times (I was, honestly, never bothered by that because that's what DC is and I don't see why everyone has a problem with that), but even tho I liked Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, I will admit and say that this movie has something those two movies didn't have. The appeal. And the main reason for that is the best thing about the movie:the characters. They are well written (a few of them are kinda paper thin, let's take Killer Croc for example) and every actor nailed the role he or she played. And by the way, don't expect to see much of The Joker. Leto killed it and he captivates every time he's on screen, but he's on screen for probably 10 minutes in total. But even tho everyone was great in their roles, the biggest star of the movie is Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. I just couldn't write this review without mentioning her. I can't wait to see more of her and Leto. And also Jai Courtney as Captain Boomeramg nailed it. If you didn't like him before, you will still like him here, trust me. Also, if you were worried about the PG-13 rating, stop worrying. When you see the movie, you will see that it didn't even need an R rating. R rating would probably just make it look kinda pretentious.Basically, if you're interested, go see it and ignore the critics. This is the best DCEU movie yet and if you're a fan, it's guaranteed that you'll love it!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Definitely not so bad, as a lot of people say","I don't really know what people expect when they watch a movie about famous villains from DC comic books. I know comic books can be deep and complicated, difficult and classy. But hey - this is not one of these! If you like and have read DC comic books over many years you probably should expect something like this movie - at least for starters. Then we might get something deeper. Right now it's light, not complicated, entertaining and sometimes funny. Some roles are great - I myself loved Harley Quinn's, Jokre's and Deadshot's performance. If you expect the film about DC villains to have drama, romance, deep relationships or complicated analysis of human morality in it - stop right now and go watch something else. This is FUN movie. And it's good if you start thinking about it like that. I enjoyed the film and would recommend it to anyone who likes not very sophisticated comic books about meta-humans. It's fun!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Awful Joker,"An Awful Joker, a Batman who beats up someone in front of his kid, a fire dude who just repeats the same backstory over and over again, and in general just weak characters especially the villain.Harley Quinn was cool I guess, and my the dead shot guy played by Willow smith.

Horrible Writing and Direction,"Wow. What an unbelievable mess of a movie.As someone who is good friends with several of the crew members of this film, I can tell you for a fact that David Ayer did NOT have any clear vision of this project and had no respect for his crew, the actors, WB, the DC characters themselves, or comic books in general.The amount of reviews posted about how his ""brilliant"" ""dark visions"" were destroyed/manipulated by WB studios make me unsure of whether to cringe or burst into laughter.This movie was doomed from the moment they hired him to write and direct.Next time, hire someone who actually LIKES comic books, values the creative work of others, and knows how to treat human beings with respect.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Pretty decent superhero movie,"First up I'm gonna say I'm a bit sick of superhero / comic adaptation films. They've dominated action films for a decade and I'm a bit over them.Having said that, I quite enjoyed this film. The characters were entertaining. Good action. Will Smith, Margo Robbie and Jared Leto were all superb in their roles. I thought the character of Amanda Waller was pretty good too though I found her level of ruthlessness was excessive and spoiled my enjoyment of that character a bit. Having known very little about the film before seeing it, I thought the cameos were a very nice treat.My one real complaint is that it all felt very rushed, especially in the earlier part of the film. As I was watching it there were many points where I felt that something had been cut that might have been better left in. I feel that a director's cut could very well be a lot more enjoyable than the version I saw in the cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Good because of Harley Quinn,"I tried to like this film as much as i could but the only thing that keeps me watching is that sweet/crazy Harley Quinn.

But i still love Harley Quinn though and thats just enough. I would like to see more Harley Quinn movies with this actress alone.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fun. But there is so much more potential,"Its a fun movie. But there is so much more potential. I saw it at the midnight premiere in my local IMAX theater. Full house, big screen, high volume. Yes, I had a great time. The characters are the best thing. They're awesome, especially Margot Robbie and Viola Davis who are killing it. And Jared Leto's Joker is as creepy as expected. But sadly, the script is a bit predictable. The first hour is great fun with lots of dark humor and bad-ass music. But the final hour is just standard (although there is a very good scene near the end of the film I won't spoil here). It feels like bad guys who are just playing superheroes. what they aren't. A missed opportunity because you can do many different things with bad guys you can't do with heroes. I'm missing original, creative scenes and ideas. So its the same story as with the other DC films; Awesome style, great characters. But the script is dull and the story is a mess.I think this would've been better with a comedy director like Edgar Wright or Matthew Vaughn. So I really hope there will be a sequel with a better director. This movie needs to be bat-sh*t crazy with weird people and insane, original scenes. And it can be.

"Fun, Funny, and Fierce.  Suicide's journey i as crazy as the cast.","It's here, it's here, the long awaited antihero movie has finally reared its rather odd looking head into theaters tonight. With all the justice filled men and women in sparkling underwear, Hollywood's superhero sea needed a little color added to it. Suicide Squad looks to be just the ticket to provide that color and the trailers only fueled my excitement. But one always wonders if the movie will be as good as the trailers, or if it will bite the big one. Hi, Robbie K here, and I'm here to share my opinions on the latest movie. Let's get started.The GOOD  Comedy is spot on  Decent action/antihero theme  Margot Robbie is awesomeThere is so much to say about this movie, and I wish to start with the comedy. If there is one thing superhero movies deliver on (outside of flashy outfits) it is usually a good comedic kick. Suicide Squad ups that factor as the band of rogues provide their views on life, often in a pessimistic jab. The lines are well written filled with a combination of whit and pizazz that are blended into a potpourri of themes that are very entertaining to hear. Our writers were also able to balance these lines throughout the movie, and mix in some additional comedic styles to further blend in the mix. And he delivery, alongside the timing, maximized the punch and delivered the intended relief in this rather somber tale.But you didn't come for comedy alone (this isn't Bad Moms). Noyou came for action with an antihero twist. Once again, the movie delivers as our assorted criminals tear through the CGI generated villains with their various gadgets and styles. These moments are exciting, giving a decent balance of everyone's abilities from Quinn's use of a baseball bat or Diablo's computer animated fire. The first battle in particular was my favorite of the bunch, but the other fights weren't bad and provided some exciting (often explosive) fun. And it's all nicely packaged with that living on the edge, careless joy that bad guys seem to enjoy and we expected. It's dark, it's vicious, and it certainly is funat parts (more on that later).Yet one of the biggest positives of this movie both my friend and I agree on is Margot Robbie. The beautiful actress certainly brings the sex appeal, which is highlighted by the trailers, and she certainly got a response by the audience members in the stage. Outside of looks though, she nails the role of the psychotic Harley Quinn. Her high pitched screams, the ecstatic enjoyment of danger, and the devoted passion for violence were all captured by her and she certainly brought the edge we longed for. In addition, the movies performed by Quinn matched her personality and completed the deadliness of Mr. J's assistant. She was a major carrier of the film and certainly a well-casted member of the crew.The BAD  Story was kind of lacking  Action crosses into cheesy and unbalanced territory  Emphasis on only a few characters One thing that a lot of movies can't seem to get is the balance of story with action. Suicide Squad's tale doesn't feel much like a comic book tale, and fell short on some levels for me. A random opening that drops into a long winded origin tale whose pace became very erratic. From their the tale rushed at parts and then dragged at others and prolonged dialogue prior to the fight didn't help things along. The ""twists"" behind their missions were kind of lame (and somewhat random) and was not impressive despite the buildup of the trailer (I was hoping more Joker and less gargantuan beast). It wasn't the worst story of a hero flick, but this reviewer thinks it needed some tightening up.Something else that didn't stay consistent was the action. Remember I said the first battle was exciting, fast, and truly rocked. Well that momentum gradually gets lost as the movie progresses. Exciting romps become quick skirmishes where overdramatic theatrics are the weapon of choice instead of choreographed numbers. The exciting conclusion at the end is probably the least engaging of the fights, and dropped into the uber theatrical, symphony driven sequences that Hollywood loves. In addition some of the comedic irony in the film made the battle almost pointless and only further took away from the action.And finally the balance on the characters was a little skewed considering the trailers announcing the line up. Deadshot and Harley Quinn took center stage in both story and action, and although they portrayed it well kind of robbed the involvement of the other characters. Pyro and Sorceress had their own contributions to tale, but even those were a cheesy subplot that fit awkwardly in this tale. As for Killer Croc, Captain Boomerang, and other members of the team, they fell into comedic relief positions that either started a laugh riot or fell on deaf ears. Again, everyone played their parts well, but the disproportionate representation of the characters and the unorganized tale robbed us of potential magic. So much for teamwork I guess.The VerdictDespite the cheesiness, uncouth, and disproportionate aspects of the movie, Suicide Squad is certainly a fun movie to kick August off with. I feel you many will certainly enjoy the laughs that the gang will provide and the action sequences are sure to get some applause until they fall into corny territory. Again it doesn't seem like they could decide on the route to go, but DC studios is getting closer to getting the formula right. Is this movie worth a trip to the theater? I think it certainly is, but not in 3-D if I do say so myself.My scores: Action/Adventure/Comedy: 8.0-8.5 Movie Overall: 7.0",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Good movie,"First of all this is my first review and I'm writing it on my phone so please, don't kill me.I saw the movie yesterday and at first I had really mixed feelings. There are few things that still bothers me, but the more time passes and I go through the movie in my head, the more I start to like it. Sure there was too many ""jokes"" for my liking and in someway the soundtrack (as good as the songs are) annoyed me, but in the end those are minor things. Where was the mess and whatnot that some critics/reviewers are writing about? Simple plot and lot's of action with some great performances by the actors equals a good and solid comic book movie in my book. OK, if you are waiting for some deep and complex plot with unseen twists and turns, then you may/will be disappointed.Overall I don't get what the h*ll were the critics waiting for? A new American Beauty? Suicide Squad was entertaining and I'm already waiting for the Blu-ray to come out. S.S. delivers a good basis for some aggressive expansion within the DC universe character-wise!...However with all that said I still do hope there would be a more darker director's cut version released with the blu-ray/DVD as this movie has the potential to be even better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not perfect. But very entertaining,"This is not the ""savior"" of DC films. So far I've liked both MOS and BvS but it's more likely than not that I'm in the minority. Out comes Suicide Squad and though it's not a home run that's gonna turn the game around, it's a solid hit. It has comedy that doesn't feel forced (looking at you Civil War) it doesn't jeopardize the character's villainous demeanor to make them more likable but they don't exploit the bad guy cliché either to a point where you can't relate to them unless you're pure evil. It's got some heart warming moments. The action is insane. Shaky cam a bit annoying sometimes, tho. Leto's Joker works but it's not as ""Joker-y"" as I guess most people expects. There are certain scenes where you kinda expect more to happen but yet it unfolds in quite a satisfying rhythm. Waller... *shivers* The villain was not that great. All skwad member have their moment to shine. It's got some pleasant surprises. The soundtrack is amazing!!! I'll definitely watch it again. I implore all of you, if you wanna watch it, do it. Don't let the critics influence your decision. Don't expect the movie to be perfect either and expand your perspective. You might not love it but you might at least enjoy the experience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Oh boy, where to start.","For what is shown, it's solidly, okay. But among this mess of a blockbuster actually lies a descent story (in the first half at least) and neither the studio nor director Ayers, seem interested in exploring any of it. The Joker and Harley Quinns relationship, for example, is all show no tell. Why does she love him? Why does he love her? Because they're both insane, isn't an answer.It's not just those two love sick puppies whose characters get butchered by the power of editing, either. Everyone's back stories and motivations (the most interesting part of the movie) are made second (sometimes third) to a by-the-numbers 'defeat the bad guy' plot line. Only Smith's Deadshot gets any real screen time to offer reason to why he'd want to the save the world. The only problem is his character ark undercurrents 'Squads' entire central theme. These are suppose to be the bad guys right?What acting chops are shown off from the cast (and surprisingly, they're mostly pretty solid) are all but wasted on a film too concerned with getting to the finish before it's even begun. The DCCU has all but hit bottom this year, giving a real perspective to why some people really hate comic-book movies. I'd say, come 2017, proceed with caution WB, but I'm pretty sure that's what's gotten you into this mess.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I keep coming back,"Ok, so, as of writing this it's been about 8 years since release. I have watched this movie at the very least 3 times a year, every year, since 2017 (1 year after it came out).Suicide Squad is easily my favourite DC movie and it's pretty easy to see why!This movie depicts Harley Quinn how she should be depicted, absolutely nuts but still remembers her training in psychiatry! She's not just the ditzy blonde anti-hero that the newer movies have shown her to be, she still has depth and her brain... (to an extent).And that was just me ranting about my favourite character!Every single character in this movie has depth and character development which I have found to be missing in the newer movies. We know why Deadshot agreed to do this in the first place, we see how manipulative Joker can be (and he's just a side character!), we see that Boomer just loves to cause a bit of trouble! I could go on and on but that would be too many spoilers!Anyway, that is why I believe Suicide Squad was definitely overlooked when it came out and to this day and probably forever it will be one of my all time favourite movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Worst Heroes Ever,"After the whirlwind that was Batman v Superman, DC needed a hit to restore faith in their product going forward. While Suicide Squad is far from the darling that I think fans were hoping for, it's also far from the disaster some predicted.Although I'm not the Zack Snyder hater that a lot of people are, I welcomed a change of pace in directing in the choice of David Ayer. His style didn't overpower the action or story like some of Snyder's choices do, but I also don't think he made a particularly fond impression on me either. Suicide Squad is an ensemble piece at its core, and I loved the way Ayer directed each and every one of these actors, but he allowed the plot around them to meander a little bit too much.Speaking of the wonderful cast, pretty much everyone came to play. Of course, there were expectedly great performances from Margot Robbie and Will Smith as Harley Quinn and Deadshot respectively, but supporting performances by Jai Courtney and Viola Davis nearly stole the show. Courtney, who's never sold me in any role, ended up being a nice comedic foil for the team. Davis' turn as the uncompromising Amanda Waller is just about as picture perfect casting as you can get.As for those aforementioned performances from Robbie and Smith, who already starred in a film together, they carry the bulk of the character depth from Ayer's script. Though the fear of Smith's ego taking over the majority of the screen time seemed legit; make no mistake, he proved to me he's still a huge movie star who can lead a film based on his charisma alone, even if he is a hit-man. Robbie on the other-hand, does her best at trying to make the case for a Harley Quinn led Birds of Prey film or even a prominent role in the upcoming Batman solo film. Either way, I want to see more of these characters.Sadly, its characters are the single most (and perhaps the only truly) compelling thing about Suicide Squad. Ayer gets off to an exciting start by seamlessly introducing all of the ""worst heroes ever"" in the first 30 minutes, but the film's plot becomes less interesting as it progresses. There's no question Ayer creates a more fun world than what was set up in BvS, but the execution was just as messy. With that said, the humor is much more earned in Squad, and it hits way more than not.With all the good, there's always some bad. With Suicide Squad, they completely botched the villain. The trailers didn't give much away at all in terms of the villain, besides the Joker, so I won't go into detail, but it was poorly handled. The villain reveal is nothing special, and we once again aren't really given any details on the villain's motivations at all. It's a common mistake some comic book films make, and Suicide Squad was no different.I guess I have to at least address Jared Leto's version of Joker. I have to admit, I'm actually not totally sure how I feel yet. He's completely different from Ledger's iconic turn in 2008, but he also doesn't really have enough screen time for me to form an opinion on him just yet. So for now, I want to see more of him.As a whole, Suicide Squad is a fun time at the movies, but it's nowhere near the film I wanted it to be. Besides the cast, it doesn't have a whole lot going for it. There's a bit too much meandering in storytelling along with a disappointingly botched villain. Here's hoping DC can right the ship with Wonder Woman next summer.+Robbie is a revelation+Smith kills it+Humor and fun tone is realized+First 30 minutes is a blast-Plot meanders-Villain is a big miss7.0/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An action entertainer that could have been much more.,"Suicide Squad opens up with one of the best sequences DCEU. The case files, narrative and the flashback sequences where just great. Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Jay Hernandez performances are the once that impress and stands out among squad members. The movie had its own moments here are there like the acid factory scene,third act and the mid-credits. Third act with all the slo mo's and frames were enough to elevate the movie much more.Coming to cons, The plot is the main thing that weakens the movie. The whole plot missed a lot of factors making it imperfect as well as make the film feel pointless at times. Lack of proper screen presence for Joker was yet another disappointing factor. Most of the other members of the squad either felt wasted or sidelined as the film reached its end.In the end, Suicide Squad is an entertaining ride with DC's supervillains and anti-heroes.Rating:67%",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Suicide Squad arrives posthumously ...,Apart from Jared Leto's turn as The Joker and a few fun moments with Robbie and Leto this comic book entry is flat and somewhat dull despite the action.The premise: In the wake of Superman's death an Intel Operative proposes to utilize the skills of some criminals with powers of their own (ala The Dirty Dozen) against an enchantress and her minions.The introduction of each of the super criminals gives hope that this is going to be a fun ride but it never pans out. Much humor is needed but the little we get is pathetic! This is an example of a project poorly thought out and even more poorly executed.,4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It did its job to entertain,"I think ultra fans will hate this film but I thought the film was entertaining. You sort of going to have to do you homework a bit if you don't know who these guys are. They are DC villains and since the rise of the anti-hero, DC decided that it would be fun to through a ""what if"" scenario. What if the villain becomes the hero and thus the Suicide Squad, named so because the government wouldn't care if they die. The movie does a brief introductions to each villain and assumes that the audience knows who they are.. and if you don't, if may be confusing. After that brief intro the movie just jumps right into it. Between the intro and ""the mission"".. there is a giant plot (or lack of plot) hole. Will Smith is the unofficial leader of the bad guys and Will Smith plays Will Smith in all his movies.Listen its not a clean movie. It is, truly like a live issue of a comic book. Lots of action. i wasn't bored. A lot of the other villains (outside of DeadShot and Harley Quinn) are kind of glossed over. Maybe I like it because Batman vs Superman was long and boring. This was short and to the point. If you want more, see another movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Most over-hyped and disappointing film of 2016,"So the critics were right all along about Suicide Squad. In fact, the 40+ rating on metacritic is a little bit generous. Batman vs Superman is better and that movie was mediocre at best. The first half of the film was really messy due to the weird pace and despite the character flashbacks, the characters never connected with me. The only ones that stood out are Amanda Waller and Harley Quinn. I can't say much about the Joker because he only had a cameo role (about 6-8mins. Of screen time), Jared's cackle is creepy though. As for the real villains of the movie, I would say that they were very underwhelming. Their introduction was very haphazardly done and I couldn't care less about what they are capable of.For the jokes, most of them felt forced. Only some of the jokes made me smile a bit and this aspect of the movie isn't even the worst part, the final act of the movie is. The climax is really cringeworthy and can be compared to the martha scene in BvS (in terms of cringe level).So overall, the film was really a big disappointment for me considering how obsessed I was with the marketing stage of this movie. It was all hype in the end and I feel bad for DCEU. Maybe Wonder Woman is DC's final hope or perhaps another Batman trilogy set in Arkham. This is really a bad streak for DC and it would be tough to recover from this. It would still rake in money but the future is dim.I'm not a professional critic but I would still give it a score for those who are obsessed with numbers. 4/10 at best.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Nice concept and some tense moments,"Pretty good concept about vilain who become hero just for the time of the mission. I enjoyed the performance as actors of Margot Robbie, Will Smith, Jared Leto and the others. Margot Robbie is pretty convicing as Harley Quinn and Will Smith as Deadshot. The movie is pretty solid technically.: the visual effects are pretty well made and the moments where they are presented at the beginning was pretty artistic and entertaining. Also the fight scenes even if they are not so much. I think all characters bring interest in the movie because they are vilain and we follow each other and understand why they act like this. The past scenes make us more empathic about some characters and we can, in one way, undefstand them.

Was it as Awesome as the Trailer made it to be!?,"Okay, I had huge expectations from this movie because the trailer was one of the best trailers I've ever seen. I was eager to see what the new Joker played by Jared Leto would be like and could he come near or even surpass Heath Ledgers Joker? Come back to that later I will give it to you straight, I left the screening very disappointed The movie falls flat and there is so much wrong that you feel betrayed almost. The story is poor and doesn't tell much at all, you get to know some things about the characters past and what they did to end up in jail, but that's about it. The ""Squad"" don't know one another until they assembles and they have their first mission ever and just like that these ""super villains"" just becomes like family after just one day!? (I mean they literally say that) one of them even compare them to his wife and kids, after one day!? Super Villains!? It goes from one scene to another and nothing important happens, many of the jokes and cool scenes that were in the trailer doesn't at all feels as cool as in the trailer or as funny. And what I was most looking forward too seeing isn't even in the movie as much as the trailer kind of was telling us he would be, I'm talking about the Joker What you get to see of him looks cool but you never really get to see the characters full work, there is so much left too see and that you want to know about him. He doesn't feel complete at all and it's sad because he had SO MUCH potential! It's clear that we will see him again but I really feel that they should have used him more in this movie. The scene with the line ""I Can't wait to show you my Toys!"" was even CUT out from the movie! Why!? Some of the scenes were cool but many seemed to prepared and weren't played naturally by some actors, unfortunately one of them was Joel Kinnaman (our Swedish star) that honestly wasn't that believable as Rick Flag. However there still was some good things and the best of it was the Soundtrack! Amazing music trough out the whole movie. Margot Robbie who played Harley Quinn also did an amazing portrayal of the villain and stood out most from the performances of the Squad. Will Smith and Jared were good too. Overall, it was mediocre, I really feel this movie could have been SO much better and it doesn't do the trailer justice. It's not near epic but it has some entertaining moments, not at all a good story but a few good performances blend that in together and you get something okay.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Lifetime comic book fan that is 100% satisfied,"PROLOGUE: Here's the deal guys, I don't know what movie the critics are watching, but please go see this one for yourself. We went six people deep and not a single person was let down. Two people have texted me tonight, knowing i'd write this review, telling me it's their new favorite super hero film. I CANNOT understand how all of these film critics thought the ending of Guardians of the Galaxy (where our hero tries to have a dance off with the massively underdeveloped villain followed by unexplained magic stuff winning the day followed by a dancing cartoon baby tree) was brilliant, but try to claim there was anything wrong with the way this film went down. The similarities are staggering (besides the stupid dance off) So lemme spin it for you. First off, this movie is FUNNY. It doesn't make fun of itself the way some superhero films do with their comedy, just the characters themselves are funny, and we get a fun bit of profile on all of them early on (besides two and they were both pretty underused (gripe #1)) I LOVED that the presence of The Bat and The Joker were background elements, sort of like two different myths in the villain world that are on opposite ends of the bad spectrum. This is definitely not their movie, but I appreciate their inclusion (not putting them into this world they helped create would've been dumb). If you couldn't tell from the trailer Deadshot and Harley get most of the screen time, and honestly deservedly so. This was Will Smith at the top of his game, he was easily one of my favorite characters to watch the whole film. Everyone else (besides those two I mentioned) get their screen time, their action, and their jokes in. I was surprised at how much use they got out of these characters, especially considering how much the reviews bagged on that very subject. (pro tip, if you wants loads of extra backstory on these characters beyond what the film gives, I recommend comic books. The backstory exists in spades.) My second gripe (and my ONLY other gripe) is that while the source of the conflict was a pleasant surprise (given that the trailers don't spoil any of it) the actual villain was pretty mysterious and we don't get many answers on that subject. It's just one of those things you, as a viewer in a superhero movie where magic and superpowers exist, are going to have to take at face value. For the most part the villain basically exists to bring these characters together and provide action when necessary, but we're given a pretty cool climactic sequence because of it. TL:DR - I'm a comic book fan, I'm an action movie fan, I'm an ensemble fan, and I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It's funny, the action is dope, the acting is great, Amanda Waller was perfect, the Joker cameos (because they are basically cameos) were fun and gave Harley's character some extra spice, the Batman Cameos were short but solid, and STAY AFTER THE CREDITS for some extra stuff : ) Favorite characters: - Deadshot - El Diablo - Amanda Waller",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Dismal Crap.,"As much as I prefer the DC universe over Marvel, those behind the movies seem unable to replicate the ingenuity and entertainment level of superhero competitors Marvel. Pretty much every movie DC have produced since the turn of the millennium has been disappointing (and yes, I do include Nolan's vastly over-rated Batman trilogy in that statement).Suicide Squad is no exception a chaotic mess of a movie that lingers in the mind for about as long as it takes the Flash to nip to the shops and back. Writer/director David Ayer clearly hopes that the novelty of a team of super-villains will be enough to carry the movie, but he's wrong: Suicide Squad is desperately in need of a creative driving force who is more concerned with telling a decent story than showcasing his cool characters and blowing his budget on an arsenal of trendy graphics and expensive CGI special effects.As far as the cast are concerned, Will Smith is adequate as Deadshot, the world's greatest hit-man, Margot Robbie's butt is great as Harley Quinn's butt, and Karen Fukuhara as Katana ably fulfils the token Asian hottie role for the overseas market, but everyone else is bland and instantly forgettable, including Jared Leto as the worst incarnation of the Joker to ever grace the silver screen. And whoever thought that the world's ugliest supermodel, Cara Delevingne, would make for an imposing villainess needs their head checked: she's dreadful.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Better than critics say,"Suicide Squad the highly anticipated movie of 2016 is out and not a lot of people are happy about it. Before I say what I liked, let me get what I didn't like out of the way. The main problem with this movie is the plot. The plot is awful and I am upset that they couldn't come up with anything better. My second problem was editing/cuts. The editing was very very weird at times and I could tell they cut out a lot of important scenes from the movie. My last problem with this movie was the VILLAIN, they really could't come up with any and I mean ANY other villain then who they picked in this movie. Now lets talk about some things I liked. One thing I liked was Margot Robbie. She was incredible. Well that's all I have for now I will finish this review later",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not That Bad,"My luck is that I watched the movie without high expectations not as most of people did, and it wasn't really that bad as everyone saying.But I have to say that David Ayer failed to make a great film, he didn't even do anything unique or special ,not a single thing, and all the mistakes in the film are one his behave as he is the director and also the writer of the screenplay (alone).I also watched the Blur-ray extended version not the cinema's version, and I didn't find montage mistakes as I heard so I think they were managed in the Blu-ray version.the film begins with bad introduction to the team members except for Deadshot and Harley Quinn there introductions were so good for me.The presence of Batman in the movie was tremendous and was managed really good.Jared Leto's Joker wasn't definitely better than Heath Ledger's but I still loved it, it's The Joker and he is Jared Leto after all.I have to raise my hat to will smith and Margot Robbie for there acting and taking there characters to a new level, they may be the only good thing in this film besides Batman.The villain was really really really bad, with a very bad acting and horrible effects and without a clear goal or even a reason and that's what make the whole film meaningless to certain degree.I loved Rick flag by Joel Kinnaman and didn't love Amanda Waller by Viola Davis that much.so after all it isn't that bad but it's that good either . so my rating is 6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"It's cool, but what happened?","I am a huge DC fan, and was eager to see the film when I first caught wind that 'Suicide Squad' was in the making. Though having many expectations, hopes, etc, I walked into the theater with a blank slate - I wanted to judge this film based on the film alone, without comparison to any other sources.The film has a quality soundtrack, and Will Smith and Margot Robbie's characters fill the screen with their amazing acting and portrayals of these quirky villains, and though slightly overused, the kaleidoscope effect in the end credits was pretty cool... But I think most of the film's budget went into that rather than the post-production editing team's paycheck.The editing was okay, but it muddled up the time lapse within the film. Though ""3 days"" had passed, it had felt as though the whole film had happened within a single night. It was messy, and the CGI with Cara Delevigne's character felt a little mediocre.Suicide Squad had potential, and if the producer(s) had made their minds up rather than creating two 'separate' films and awkwardly combining them both together, it could have truly been a great film. The pomp and flash of the design and humor caters to a wider audience, and it's no secret why Suicide Squad is doing so well financially. But the truth is, though it has some great characters and awesome music, it's not well edited and it's not a brilliant film.It tried to bring in the humor and kick of Deadpool with the whimsicality of Guardians of the Galaxy, and I feel that if DC tried to be DC, and stopped trying to compete and out-do Marvel, it could produce something truly spectacular. We've seen the Dark Knight, we know what DC can do, it's about time it brought that flare back and created something truly spectacular.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Everyone seems to be complaining and I can't understand why...,"Magic would be my first point of call when trying to criticise Suicide Squad. I'm up for most things within the semi-realist settings DC and Marvel give us, but for me, some of the Aztec God magic got a little out of hand. I mean Batman may as well be dead if the villains in these things are that powerful. But I get that you need a lost cause denouement before a battle finale closes the deal.I think there is something to be said for cutting edge movies, whether they are full of themselves or not. In this case, perhaps the confidence in its own novelties mirrors that of some of its characters, rendering the entire concept what should be a secret garden for critics, and a minefield for the less apt at subtext. Intentionally or accidentally, Suicide Squad has done something different, not with its style or themes, approach to storytelling or even with the story itself; but with its dangerous attitude towards all of these things. We're thrown into a movie which kind of knows what it's doing- an unfunny Edgar Wright style overblown 'meta- human' movie- and that's good enough for some, but I like to tear a bit at the corners. In terms of consistency, David Ayer is a little shaky here and there. I don't know where Killer Croc comes from for instance and I don't care, a mistake here as he could have been a good character. Unfortunately he was used for awkward out of place jump-humour, the worst type of humour unless it's done by Will Smith or Margot Robbie, and they at least use it to enhance the feel of the scene, not shatter it.Still though, I absolutely loved this film. Yes, it has its faults and its five second cringe moments, and its gross overtones of the words 'fat budget' written on every chopper, fireball or Aztec ring of power. But what film nowadays doesn't have that? The key is to pretend not to see all of it.Let's talk more about the good stuff then. I'm not going to say Jared Leto was a step up from Heath Ledger, but he certainly wasn't a step down. After Ledger, I don't think it would be possible for a fan such as myself of his work to simply say 'clean slate' Joker- wise. But I can compare them. Leto brings a slightly more empathetic approach to the role, but with a darker, crazier variation on the insanity. Our Joker here is a very deeply disturbed, although less explained, Joker who is...in love? Yes, I suppose so. Leto did do the whole method actor thing whilst basically doing a Heath Ledger reboot but with a love story tied in. Now that I write this that realisation has hit me, and I feel annoyed. But I loved his performance, I guess you can understand why.The script, minus the flaws I've mentioned, was solid. And I almost didn't notice that most of the characters motives slipped into any writer's default: love. It's not a poor plot default, but it felt a little tired to me. Regardless, the screenplay didn't get to a point where I might get disconnected from everything, and the subtleties were well placed, the characters well written (aside from the crocodile guy) and the dialogue both believable and collaborative with the film as a whole. What the script also does well, is take us on an emotional journey as well as a war movie one, we do get to see the sides of these characters we haven't seen before. This is one of the things I had no fear that Ayer wouldn't do. But I think it worth noting that this is still an accomplishment to be applauded. I even liked the occasional self-referential lines, which if anything is an achievement in itself because usually I find them clichéd, arrogant and tiresome. Not in this case though, everything was well balanced.The performances from everyone else were just as fantastic, and I could not stress enough how happy I am that the movie starring two of the most stunning (wink) actresses today, only made them spend 98 percent of their screen time dressed somewhat seductively. Stylistically, I don't know what other critics are complaining about, the use of colour is fascinating and brilliant- highlighting the very nature of the message of the film as well as the various characters in an almost impressionistic way.Tonally, Suicide Squad appears convoluted, but one can always make stuff up. It could have been for instance, that that was the entire point, the style helps us get into the messed up heads of these psycho-super villains and better understand their perception of the world around them...or it's just more fun to watch a film at this scale doing something more exciting than relentless slow motion shots of death scenes we've seen a thousand times, or a five minute funeral procession no-one in the audience can believe or accept because the chance is too high that the character isn't actually dead by the end of it- total waste of time. And yes, that was a gentle dig at Batman Vs Superman. Suicide Squad and Deadpool have for me made an excellent contribution to their genre- a genre I would even venture to say is a new creation. I like it, evidently some don't.More from me at edramsey496.blogspot.co.uk",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One word: sucks,"This movie is so utterly boring. We all know we went to see Harley Quinn being super sexy gratious shots of her behind in spandex. She is only in a few flashes. Otherise she is merely your borderline girl next door going through post-puberty and another white knight.The dialogues are so bad you will be in awe. For example: alligator man uses phrases as ""bro"". But he has been in the sewer forever and only gets cable AFTER the whole ordeal. The dialogues are written for boys aged 8-10. And not to recreated the Gotham universe.Also, the joker. Who is this guy ? He looks like a young Marily Manson. But then, what a way to rape the legendary performances of those Jokers before...The whole movie seems to want to be ""Heroes of the galaxy"", you get a sense with the animations and the music that is what they were going for. But at no point the movie matches the same feeling maybe even A- team like during the introduction. But it wont generate the same enthusiasm at any point as the latter.I really hoped the movie would pick up and redeem itself. It never did. It never reached excitement above ""meh"".

One of the worst,"Joyless action scenes and uninteresting characters as destroying what could have been an excellent action comedy . This here is not good enough in 2016Unfortunately comprises the entire first hour of verbal cockfight to emphasize how tough everyone is , they play certainly not following any rules , they are real men ( even the women ) . A better film could have let the insults bounce between the figures and give the dialogue momentum, and then turn on the conflicts and build cohesion. Now everything hangs freely. No call leads to another.In fact, when the great supernatural threat would emerge the actors to change lines with each other , or play completely different super villains , but the story would be significantly affected. Get things done based on the characters, they just happen . It actually is character -driven foundation laid in flashbacks dripping with sentimentality. Why should we care about group dynamics and drama as the characters themselves do not? Not even entertainment violence is something up to much . The action scenes are trimmed in joyless 2010 's of ways: fast and confusing, with no sense of time , place or choreography.The only thing that holds together the film is Will Smith and Margot Robbie . Robbie is , in the worst comic book spirit of sexuality but she seems to have fun when she wields his baseball bat and hatch one- liners . Smith has a generic Will Smith 's role , with generic motivation - he wants to prove to his daughter that he was not only a murderer , but may be OK . Fortunately , he has enough charisma to sell it."" Suicide Squad "" could have been action-comedy that saved the DC Comics movie universe from his own lack of humor. So it was not . It is not enough to dull dialogue and environments they bought when there was a sale on broken cities of the backdrop shop.

"Yes, I liked this movie.","I really liked Suicide Squad. Maybe because I wasn't expecting something big and sensational. I watched that movie as a spin-off, not as the giant blockbuster like most of people was expecting. I loved the cameos, the ""honour among thieves"" one in particular, with my all time favorite comic book character in it.Even if there are some editing issues in that part of the movie, I liked the opening with the presentation of the characters. Kinda reminded me the Watchmen opening. (Even if I think Watchmen is way better at all points!)There are a lot of trailers scenes that are missing in the final cut and I was a little bit disappointed because they're mostly about the Joker...

Great movie! Exactly what I expected from a Suicide Squad movie.,"I was extremely excited to see this movie, maybe even more so than Batman v Superman. And it does not disappoint! It is quite dark and definitely not for a youngster but it is definitely what we want from a DC movie. It veers away from the norm but what do you expect from a Suicide Squad movie? Very different to the Marvel movies which tends to be a bit lighter. Suicide Squad has dark colors, dark characters and dark humour, which is what I feel DC is about, darkness. The story is a lot more linear than BvS but still achieves the suspense you want in a comic book movie. Margot Robbie is a perfect fit for Harley Quinn. Jared Leto is a different joker compared to Heath Ledgers but still amazing. I hope to see more of this joker and definitely want to see more of Harley Quinn! I feel Amanda Waller was portrayed very well, merciless and dangerous. The special effects were amazing and the fight scenes very well designed. The music is perfect for such a wacky and dark movie. The little Easter eggs in the movie were great and didn't feel as forced as BvS.

The rest of them are not even worth analyzing. Then you have the witch, which was the worst of the bad, seems to me that Cara is talent-less for acting, worst if it's suppose to be a obscure and ancient villain.The only reason for not giving a 1 out of 10 is Harley Quinn.

A decent film but lack of decent plot plays the spoilsport!,"Suicide Squad is a superhero film based on the DC Comics super-villain team of the same name.

These have to be the worst incarnations of The Joker and Harley Quinn ever put to screen. Margot is just straight up annoying and is only in there for sex appeal, and Jared's acting is absolutely horrible. Every other actor leans on bad or average. The characters are all idiots and are completely one dimensional. The storyline is so unbearably stupid and is riddled with plot holes and the overall editing and effects are god awful.

too much of disappointments,"The conversations are too weak, too many plot holes. the first half is fair enough with character intros.When the real deal starts, too many plot holes, there are parts that come out of nowhere where i had to think that, that happened may be because of that. things happen out of no where, the connections between some scenes are to be connected by the viewer. amanda you are worst here. you were not portrayed well. i guess the other super heros partied hard last night so they couldn't show up. if someone can cut a pillar in half then they should be able to cut the pillar in half the next time. The bar scene talk was an epic disaster. Enchantress is dumb here and the way she was shaking her ass was epic LOL. too many DC disappoints. the final scene was the worst, too much cloudy, poor CGI! i had hopes high and they fell like a bird that that got heartattack in the mid flight.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not that bad...,"But could be better. There are a multitude of characters and I must admit I don't know them all. I did only read pulp comix when I was a young kid when waiting at the hairdresser. So if you're puzzled it's a bit like in The Avengers, a lot of personae. Also like in X-men, where at the end they focused more at one character, e.g. Logan. Probably Will Smith had to pay his tax bill when he signed on and he never will be a really bad guy, even when he hits Chris Rock. But honestly I don't see that much difference with other superheroes movies. They are per definition unrealistic. The most surprising was Deadpool I. But with number II much less. Music and sound are very present, but a matter of taste and age. Very present and sometimes to loud, but the young ones like it I suppose...?Like in many things less is more, develop all this characters in one movie with an interesting scenario is difficult. To much ingredients.... but relatively pleasant to watch... I don't see that much diffence with the other superheroes movies. And my preferred one was The Incredibles :-)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
perfect movie for all audiences,"suicide squad is a wonderful and fun movie for you and your friends . it is so much better than batman vs superman and a lot more fun than the past dc movies . this could be the movie that saves dc from the bad reputation it has because of batman v superman . Harley Quinn was awesome , Margot Robbie did a great job but the joker wasn't as good as Heath Ledger's joker . katana , captain boomerang , killer croc , and enchantress as well as rick flag were great but el diablo was a little dull . and slipknot , well , he wasn't in the movie for so long . at the end this movie is a great movie and worth your time that's why I give it a 9/10 .",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Suicide Squad is a massive problem,"When I saw this film for the first time, I thought it was okay but today I consider this to be one of the worst superhero films of all time. There are so many elements in this film that do not work at all. The first 20 minutes really prove how bad the movie is and almost every scene feels unwarranted.It was really hard for me to like any of the characters because their scenes as the film goes along do not have any depth to it. The pacing as well is really poor and I'm surprised because superhero films do not usually have pacing issues because it's fast-paced action but this one really felt slow.The many problems that Suicide Squad has goes way deeper than I thought. There were production issues and the studio had to reshoot a huge portion of the film and when I first got news of this, I immediately understood why this movie felt way off. It's a bad film and watching this will just waste 2 and half hours of your day.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A comic book pasted onto your Screens,"The movie was great. It is a comic book just converted to a video format. Critics' expectations in a movie will be different from comic book readers. Overall, It is a treat to comic book fans. Critics refer a lot for complicated ""Nolan"" Movies and then rate them, why not read a comic and then rate this movie? But, it would be better if a normal audience had a comic book reader aside, just to inform about the depth of the characters, otherwise they may end up confused. Expected a lot from Mr. J but news has that some of his scenes have been cut. It will be a musical experience than a film. Background story could have been a little more clear and other than that this movie is just a treat.

DC seems to be getting it right... slowly...,"I finally got around to watching the movie after missing out at the cinema. Kind of glad as it was the extended cut.I also watched after YouTube Veteran I Hate Everything released his own scathing review of the movie...So the key is what do I think?Well, in all honesty - IHE - Or Alex as he is better known - had many valid points about the film... For me the film is a mix of the Good, The bad and the downright Ugly.The Joker: The GoodJared Leto - I have to admit, I was concerned about Leto as The Joker - Following up the late Heath Ledger was going to be an uphill struggle.Thankfully, he actually pulled it off... More of a reckless gangster than Ledger's darker portrayal, Leto does come across the right side of Crazy and sells the New Joker very well indeed...The Bad:Simple - LACK OF SCREEN TIME!!! Maybe DC and WB have plans for a solo Joker Movie but if that's the case, Suicide Squad FAILS TO SELL THAT VISION!The Ugly: Flamboyant though the Joker is in the DC Canon, Many have taken exception to the Makeup and tattoos of Leto... I am somewhere in between, they do suit his portrayal but I can also see why fans are up in arms.Harly Quinn, Margot Robbie is FANTASTIC and gets the best amount of screen time to sell her character in my view. Sadly, and it is rumoured to have been a major point of contention for Robbie on set, she is WAY TOO OVERSEXUALISED!This does detract a lot from what should be a very personality driven character.The Effects are FANTASTIC! The sets look great and a perfect balance of CGI Vs Practical for many set pieces works well... With that said, there is a LOT of CGI. Which actually leads into IHE's Biggest gripe and one I concur with.In a Universe that has Batman and The Flash, Both making Cameos... They rely on the Suicide Squad to take out this evil... WHAT THE F**K!?Seriously, While the Enchantress looks amazing, and the first transition is LEGENDARY - I can see why Alex calls this the best scene in the movie, it truly is epic in its simplicity - the overall idea and what they are fighting... NO! JUST NO! THIS IS NOT A JOB FOR THE SUICIDE SQUAD!!!While we are on Enchanteress, Carla Delevigne is one of those Models that everyone raves about, but to be honest I have never really paid any attention to... As the Archaeologist, she plays her role very well indeed and seems to be a very competent actress......But when she becomes Enchantress which is 90% of the movie, She is not acting!!! She is just being a damn supermodel!!!Now some may rave about this, but I am sorry - it really spoils the immersion. She literally is just modelling!!! BORING! A real shame as I think she actually has real potential.Will Smith - What more can you say - He is Will Smith!!!Overall, Each Character is great and played well... Its also where the film suffers its greatest issues.It has action a plenty, some lovely slower moments to develop SOME of the characters - El Diablo's story is great... But there is too much to build on...While in the comics each character has had time to shine and build up a history, there is no room for that here!Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang is actually great fun - But you never really get to know him... This is a character that needs a place in a stand alone movie to build his history. Likewise, Killer Croc, El Diablo has a story that would be great for the Big Screen...For DC's Cinematic Universe, Suicide Squad is a step in the right direction - Overall I found the movie very entertaining, but it lacks in other areas.The problem is that the movie has been made far too early - All the characters could have done with a role as a villain or their own stand alone to really shine!Its has plenty of action, some real heart wrenching moments and some laughs - Nothing laugh out loud funny but some... And it is enjoyable!But DC is never going to compete with Marvel as long as they keep trying to cram so much in!DC, Warner Bros... SLOW IT DOWN!!! You saw what happened to Spider- Man when they tried to shove in way too many story arcs and characters... You are doing the same thing!!! BUILD UP!!! That's what is needed!!!So overall, I have marked it quite low for those technical reasons - There is so much potential in this movie that was wasted by trying to go full force too soon.A real shame as actually it not a bad film at all... But its way too cluttered and most of the characters you just won't give a toss about unless you are an avid comics fan.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Yes The Joker was awful but...,Harley Quinn was as annoying as any character I have ever seen.

All, the characters are kinda forced to group up against some illogical $h!t storm that was ""accidentally"" created. The plotting was really poor, even a 7 or 8 grader could come up with something more appealing. Hope, others don't make the mistake I did.

Superbly packaged mediocrity,"I was expecting much more from Suicide Squad given the massive hype it has received throughout the past year.The film centres around a group of imprisoned highly dangerous villains, including Deadshot, Harley Quinn, El Diablo and others who are recruited as a team/weapon by the CIA.The plot is quite average, with some obvious mistakes/holes. However the movie is very well shot, camera work is superb, and the highlight of the movie is the awesome soundtrack of golden oldies (The Animals, Stones, CCR and Queen to name a few) which often has you singing along.As for the actors, Margot Robbie is superb as Harley Quinn and is definitely the attention grabber in this film. Will Smith is acceptable-yet-lacklustre as Deadshot. Jai Courteney is brilliant as Captain Boomerang. My biggest disappointment was Jared Leto's interpretation of the Joker (who was absent throughout the majority of the film). All previous interpretations of the Joker captured his essence (random, slightly kooky or camp), but Leto's Joker is calculating,and portrayed as an angry (rather than crazy) mobster/pimp with too much bling on.Overall, it was a fun experience but a let down after all the hype.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Suicide Squad 2016 Review,This film came out back in 2016 and as most fans know the released theatrical cut was heavily altered from the directors intended cut which was more somber darker and focused mostly on the abusive relationship between Joker and Harley with the Will Smith character as the 2nd main plot about him and his daughter.Story The basic story is similar to the comics in the sense the Suicide Squad is a team of B and C list characters who are put together by the government to go out on missions of there choosing. This time the government needs them to take out a magical threat in the form of Enchantress. The sauad is made up of a team of criminals who if they disobey there heads will explode from the bombs implanted in there necks by the government. The story is a basic enough set up but it's hurt by lack of development for the characters because of the fact Warner Brothers hacked out so many development scenes for the Squad members and replaced them with pop music and popular classic song tracks to try to imitate the tone of Deadpool and Guradians of the Galaxy more. The original cut was all score based was told in chronological order without constant flashbacks to stuff in the characters past namely Harley Quin. The characters who suffer most are the Joker played by Jared Leto and the Enchantress character. Jared Leto does the best with what he had to work with in this in a role that was cut down to what feels like 5 minutes. The studio in there wisdom removed the Jokers entire subplot which was originally the heart of the movie because it connected directly to the abusive relationship between Joker and Harley Quin. The entire abusive relationship arc between Joker and Harley from the comics has been completely taken out by the studio for the sake of watering the movie down to sell to the teen masses. Seemingly all of the relationship development between June Moon aka the Enchantress and Rick Flag has been totally removed also watering the film and characters down.Acting The performances are all mostly good all the actors seemingly try there best with what they had to work with. Jared Leto had the least to work with also with Cara as Enchantress because nearly all of there development scenes and character set up scenes were removed from the movie. Still I think all the actors tried there best with what was left in this movie for there characters to chew on.Directing The directing is solid some good visuals especially with Enchantress and some good set piece shots with Joker and Deadshot and Diablo the fire shooting meta human. Still you can feel the director being held back because the majority of the heart of the film has been removed or straight up altered forcefully by the studio who demanded cuts and reshoots to lighten the films tone for teenagers and family audiences and demanded the score be replaced by pop music.Score Not much going on here what we do hear sounds OK but it's impossible to know how good it would have been because the whole score is drowned out by constant pop music you can thank the studio for that.Overall What we should have gotten was director David Ayers intended somber dramatic action film cut. Instead what we did get was the studios dumb blockbuster cut for the masses. That's not to say the studio cut is totally aweful this movie isn't terrible like the critics said back in the day it just isn't what it should have and would have been in the directors intended cut. What we have here is a generic messy but enjoy dumb fun popcorn blockbuster that while messy is still fun for the actors and performances similar to something like Independence Day 7 out of 10 in terms of IMDB scores for what it is.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Disappointing.,"When this was being made I couldn't wait to see it and I was totally disappointed when I walked out of the cinema. Its the Will Smith show basically, it seem like the studio offered him the part and he agreed only if he was the main star. The joker was not hardly in the movie, the action was poor it was just too much dialogue, The soundtrack was good though and harly Quinn was awesome but Its just another film that DC could of done better and not cut so much out.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The worst Oscar-winning film of all time,"On my first viewing, I thought this film was okay, and on second viewing I proceeded to slap the stupid out of myself until my head nearly fell off, and it's such a dull mess that I don't even know where to begin, but I will attempt to do so nonetheless.Here's the good, and it's going to be very short. Harley Quinn was excellent in this film and she gets a lot of screen time, and she feels like the only character even attempting to make this a fun experience. Margot Robbie's performance is probably the only reason I was fine with the film in the first place, but it's not a good excuse.Every other character is dark and gritty, wallowing in their self-pity, and they're all a bit despicable. Deadshot is probably the second best, being mediocre and not so offensive as the others, however the film focuses on him as the main character essentially though he was not interesting enough to carry the film. He's an impossibly skilled assassin who's also a father going through a divorce while his ex-wife is an irresponsible mother, which is essentially the same thing we see in every Oscar-baiting drama ever made. Killer Croc is probably the worst simply since he gets no development or depth at any point which is a missed opportunity at morbid cannibalistic humor. Diablo is probably the only character with development, however it happens much too late in the film and the reveal comes off as contrived, and leaves him being the least active character up until the end of the film. Boomerang is simply as bland as his name sounds. Katana shows up later than the rest of the squad, and her gimmick is a sword that traps souls and has her husband's soul trapped inside, and there's no payoff to this revelation and she hardly has any screen time. There's another guy called Slipknot, the man who can climb anything, and he is the only character not to get an introduction, so it's painfully obvious that he's entirely expendable.The introduction of the film is a complete mess right out of the gate. There are literally two introductions for the main cast done back to back with popular music tossed in, making it come off as a cheap fan-made music video. There are several origin stories blasting through at the speed of light here, combining the superhero film fatigue, origin story fatigue, and whiplash of terrible pacing all together into a projectile vomit-inducing concoction.The basic plot is horribly cliche and contrived. First of all, the main conflict in the story is caused by Waller in her creation of the Suicide Squad, which isn't a concept that made any sense in the first place. Why would she think it to be a good idea to put together a team of rowdy baddies to ""fight the next Superman"" in case he were to be bad?Seriously, I understand they wanted a fun movie with bad guys being forced to fight together for good and subvert our expectations of villains, but none of that is executed effectively. Enchantress also has the MacGuffin, yada yada, giant light in the sky, and she's overpowered, leading to a dull final confrontation at the end. The monsters throughout the movie were also incredibly dull, as they were just guys in suits with weird black orbs all over their bodies, undoubtedly for the PG-13 rating.This really should have been a hard R, especially considering it came after Deadpool. It feels like a dull DP ripoff that's constantly pulling its punches since it's more concerned with marketability rather than entertainment. There's also edgy content with the Joker and Harley that feels forced. The scene in the strip club served no purpose beyond tossing in more sex appeal and killing off another character from the comics within a minute of first being shown on the big screen.The editing is incredibly jarring. The relationship between Joker and Harley was clearly edited to make the relationship seem more mutual, and thus it truly ruins the Joker's character beyond making him into a thug. There is a moment when Joker pushes Harley out of a helicopter, but it's cut in a way to reframe it to be like he was saving her and sacrificing himself instead of a morbid prank where he was trying to push her to cause harm.This Joker is clearly the worst Joker to date, which is hilarious considering how much insanity there was with Jared Leto around this film. After all his insane real life harassment and supposed method acting, all there is to show for it is what feels like five minutes of total screen time and only one line that can even be considered a joke. He acted as nothing more than a plot device for a couple of scenes with Harley Quinn that weren't the least bit important to the story ultimately, thus he was useless to the film and would have almost been better cut out entirely. Jared Leto's an overhyped person in general who claims to be an actor and a musician despite producing no quality performances for either line of work.It's hilarious that people defend this film so strongly as it's the sloppiest pile of garbage DC has offered us so far, and the one good aspect of it is simply not enough to make up for the countless flaws throughout by a long shot.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A Turn Around For The DCEU,"I was pretty anxious about this film at first. Man of Steel and Batman V Superman weren't all that greatly received, and weren't that good in my personal opinion. I was worried for the future of the DC Extended Universe. I thought it could only get worse or stay the same, but I was wrong!DC has extremely strong villains, that's why this was the perfect story to show and tell. The premise is something innovative and new, not been done before in a theatrical release. Harley Quinn was incredible, and a highlight of this movie. Margot Robbie portrayed her so well, and couldn't have done better, aside from the costume. A solo movie will be amazing! Her relationship with the Joker was perfect.Deadshot was great as well, giving him motivation to care for his daughter, and just wanting what's best for her. Similarly with El Diablo and his deceased family. Many of the villains were shown in a lighter side, and gave them humanity instead of being seen as cold blooded monsters.The story was executed so well and so close to the original material. This is such a high note for the DCEU, despite what critics say.

"Exceeded very, VERY high expectations. LOVED IT","I went to an advance screening of Suicide Squad at Event Cinema George Street Sydney on Monday with my brother and mum.Between us; 3 completely different expectations.I've read comics my whole life (from ALL publishers). Big comic book geek. Huge fan of Harley Quinn from as far back as when she was first created for the 1992 Batman Animated Series. I know everything there is about these characters and had high hopes. This movie gets the characters perfect. I absolutely loved it.My brother is 21, never read a comic in his life. Never watched the Batman or Justice League etc cartoons but has watched avengers, Ironman, Dark Knight and most of the comic book movies from the last 10ish years. Didn't know really anything about the characters coming into the movie. He absolutely loved it.My mum; never read a comic in her life, hasn't watched any of the other superhero movies. She loves romantic 'the notebook' type movies, not really into action, comedy or sci-fi at all, and definitely not the comic book movie genre. She loved it, can't wait to see it again.The standouts for me -Margot Robbie absolutely nails it and does tremendous justice to one of my all time favourite characters in fiction. Could now not imagine anyone else in the role of Harley. Exceeded expectations of a live action Harley Quinn, which I've been waiting for for over 20 years for now. Did not disappoint. Harley Solo film ASAP please.Jared Leto is the most true to comics, true to the character version we've had on film - he's awesome. My favourite Joker (well, behind Mark Hamill's animated joker). Looking forward to seeing more of Leto's Joker in future DCEU instalments.The whole cast is great, so I won't go into details about how great they each played their respective characters, but they all knocked it out of the park. Would be happy to see any or all of them turn up in future movies.I'm gonna see Suicide Squad at least twice more in the cinemas, probably more and then buy it on blue ray the day it comes out. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not all expected.,"All expested a lot from this film, trailer looked awesome, but the film has some problems. Firstly, the plot is good, it shows the squad of criminals with dome superpowers or big abilities. Some acts of characters are illogical, and can't be understood. Secondly, the cast is great, all actors are wonderful, Margo Robbie is a brilliant of film. But some characters don't have any explanation. Joker is supporting character, and I don't understand it. Thirdly, the visual effects are good.

Suicide squad,"Review By Kamal KThe task of bringing this DC Entertainment comic book story to life is on the shoulders of writer/director David Ayer. Within the first 15 minutes, it's obvious that something is off. The film doesn't start with a killer action scene that draws you in. It gets stuck in a dull parade of flashback backstories for each of the characters.As the action scenes do come into view, none are well-shot, choreographed or out-of-this-world sci-fi crazy.Hard to believe that Steven Price, Oscar-winner for the beautifully scored Gravity is responsible for the background music that sounds like it's from the Macy's Day Parade. The pacing and editing are tolerable (John Gilroy, Nightcrawler) and neither help or hinder.U. S. Intelligence officer Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), who runs a clandestine ops org named A. R. G. U. S., is trying to lead the charge against an alien super power that is threatening her city and the world. Her strategy is to fight evil with evil by enlisting the aid of hardcore super villains who are languishing in the Belle Reve Federal Penitentiary and desperate for freedom. Says Waller: ""I've finally got the worst of the worst."" She dubs them ""Meta-Humans.""She assigns military commander Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman, Robocop) to lead the mission. He brings a Samurai warrior woman named Katana (Karen Fukuhara,) along.The criminals who will form the A-Team militia are: Deadshot (Will Smith), an assassin in solitary confinement who was captured and arrested by none other than Batman (Ben Affleck, and seeing him is a buzzkill). Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie, The Legend of Tarzan and Fury) was once a psychiatrist who had a very famous patient, The Joker (Jared Leto). She let the fiend get the better of her and she now has amazing agility, fighting powers and a bad girl attitude.Slipknot (Adam Beach, Flags of Our Fathers) is a master escape artist. Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney, Divergent) is a buffed and muscular Aussie robber. Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Pompeii) is a beast with an amphibians' face. The group is rounded out with the very enigmatic and troubled Diablo (Jay Hernandez, Bad Moms) a fire starter.Unlike the Avengers or X-Men movies, where some moviegoers will be familiar with the heroes or antiheroes, this film brings a whole new set of characters to the screen that only hardcore DC comic book readers would know. The viewer is forced to meet, greet and hear the history of each, and it's a lot to ask. What's even more challenging is that none of the Suicide Squad participants have powers that are all that magical. If they really had a lot of mojo, they wouldn't spend so much time in long drawn-out and often boring fight scenes. They'd be able to annihilate their adversaries, in seconds.Though the cast members put their hearts and souls into their performances, none of their portrayals resonate and all have done better jobs in other films or TV shows.That's a further reflection on the unimaginative direction and a feeble script that never puts them in the right light or makes their characters worth watching. Given the right material, some in the cast are fully capable of handing in Oscar-worthy performances. They've done it before.As the film grinds to its cataclysmic ending (think Ghostbusters, the new one), and the witch is casting spells and fighting the squad with all the deadliness of a Miss America contestant, the scenes become less plausible, less likable, more preposterous and mundane. It's enough to drive you crazy with contempt as you think of what might have been. This is a wasted opportunity on so many levels.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I'm not really reviewing the movie, but just putting out there to watch the extended cut and give the movie another shot.

3hrs Would Have Done This Story Justice,"Suicide Squad is a highly underrated movie that tells the story of a group of criminals known as ""meta humans"" who are given an option of a reduced sentence (and their life) if they choose to help fight for the united states in the foreign affairs. The only problem is that these foreign affairs are not of human decent. In a world that now has no Superman a group of powerful people must form to help defend the planet.In my own opinion, people don't like this movie because of its comedic relief and since of ""cheese"", I think a movie like this is great because it stands out in the rest of the DC Universe, a universe that is becoming more and more dark. A movie with ALOT of interesting story lines and a new view at some familiar faces is refreshing.One note that I think could have made this movie better was to simply make it longer, this could have easily been a three hour movie. This would have allowed for a much deeper character development that didn't really exist in this movie. So many great stories rest behind these ""heroes"" that could all have their own movie, a little bit more time invested into their background I believe would have done DC well.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The problems BvS had was it was slow, tried to jam too much in and at times (as the viewer), you had no idea what direction it was trying to take. In contrast, Suicide Squad doesn't take itself too seriously and never feels like it's being dragged out at all. Margot Robbie and Jared Leto play the Clown Prince/Princess roles to utter perfection (however be warned, Leto's Joker is no Ledger's Joker, which is absolutely fine by me, he's redefined the role and made it his own). Will Smith is BACK WITH A BANG (pun intended). His take on Deadshot is exactly what I was hoping for, humorous but serious at the right times. Without revealing too much, Batman is excellent (and that's all I'll say). Lastly, Viola Davis is just plain evil as Amanda Waller and I loved her take on the iconic role. Would love her to return in the future.Overall, I'm giving this movie a perfect score because it's exactly what I hoped it would be - fun from start to finish.PS - don't let negative critic reviews sway your opinion on this movie. Negative reviews on BvS were justified. Negative reviews on this movie just seems straight up forced and uncalled for.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Two words. Harley Quinn!,"I gave this film a rating of 6 because Margot Robbie has 6 letters in her first and last names. The reason behind this is because she is the ONLY reason to watch this film! Plain and simple, Harley Quinn steals EVERY scene in this film! Forget about Jared Leto's Joker, he pales in comparison to Ledger's Dark Knight Crown Prince of Crime! This film is ALL Margot! From her hair to her HOT shorts to absolute Joker smile. This film is 100% Harley Quinn!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Ruined by Studio Interferences and a lack of clear direction.,"I know my rating seems pretty harsh, and people do like this film. To me this films is bad, pretty bad, to the point where I was bored. This is a movie that tries to be fun, to make it seem better than Batman V Superman, but it clearly clashes with the tone it had before. I had a feeling that David Ayers, a fantastic director, tried to make this film similar to End of Days or Fury where it was occupied by great characters and solid action but overall built on these characters. However, the studio decided, hey, how about adding the most generic villain possible when a terrorist or the Joker (who is barely in this film as you might have guessed) would have been much better. There are definitely plot holes, to be expected, but some of them are too major to ignore. The whole Marvel scenario where the villain is destroying the city and the Avengers aren't helping is usually an idea that works because not only do they give proper reasons, in the universe it makes sense because of the amount of villains. No one quite understands the DC universe yet, and it is inferred that apocalyptic events don't happen to much, so I would imagine for example the Flash would try to stop the villain. However the writers decided the best excuse they could make as to why they didn't alert the superheroes is because ""they could turn on the citizens at any given point"". You've heard the criticism before, but why it bugs me so much is that there is hole scene devoted to it, a scene that tries to be stylized with in your face techniques that I am sure the studio put in after realizing the film wasn't ""fun"" enough. Now some will agree with me that there was a lot of meddling behind the scene but many say the fun action scenes and memorable characters make the film good. I feel like I watched a different movie, because many of the characters are terrible. The only three I liked where Killer Croc, Captain Boomerang (hopefully Jai Courtney has more good performances like this) and Harley Quinn. It is definitely strange why these three where in the film, but I can understand because they were by far the best characters, however excluding Harley Quinn they have almost zero development. The others where too forgettable, but I feel like for example the fire guy was going to be developed, but then the studio feared there wasn't enough action or Joker scenes. Every other character remains generic or just bad to me. Some liked Will Smith as Deadshot, but there are a couple of things that pull me back from liking him. 1. He feels like he his sleeping during half the film, not at his full potential 2. He is not at all like Deadshot, which I wouldn't mind too much if Deadshot wasn't such an interesting and great villain. I thought Jared Leto wasn't a good Joker, but to be fair there was far too little of him to tell. Honestly if they re-shot the film I would opt for less Joker and more character development. The action in the movie is way, way too bland. All it consist of is shoot enemy made of basically goo, turn to ash and rinse, repeat. There never feels like there is any stakes, and the dark look of the city never adds to the feeling of ""fun"" and just contrasts it. More bar scenes would make the film more bearable and entertaining, because some characters would work better explored. Finally the soundtrack is obnoxious, it never feels like it works for the moment, and it just feels like the studio trying to enforce a style that conflicts with the rest of the film. David Ayres wanted a character film with some action, but instead its got to be a Guardians of the Galaxy rip off, and the tones never blend together. Instead of being something unique suicide squad feels like a mish mash of clichés. It tries to tell you its unique, but never goes the full mile. Some characters are interesting enough and sometimes I like how it is shot, but for the most part this film is a mess, and by far the DCEU's worst film to date.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Absolutely amazing! A MUST-WATCH!,"I hardly ever do reviews, but after hearing some misplaced criticism i see myself compelled to defend this movie. First of all, the acting is absolutely outstanding. I must admit I did not know what to expect from so many crazy characters but it definitely worked. Jared Letto did an amazing Joker, he was like a mafia boss all psychotic, plus the introduction of a love interest (Harley Quinn) added much to the plot. Margo Robbie, Will Smith and Jai Courtney were incredibly funny. The rest of the characters were also great but the 4 mentioned above really stole the spotlight. The characters are incredibly interesting, and I would like to see a movie focused of each of them. The only character i thought was a bit of an extra that (for me) kinda ruined the vibe was the Japanese sword woman (but she doesn't appear that much). Also, the plot was also very well formed and made sense, it was well put together. Yes, there's like half an hour dedicated to character introduction, but honestly, the characters are the essence of the movie (which is why it's so good). In addition, The movie is just hilarious. I laughed all the time, the characters are just so charismatic. I don't get why people hate on the movie. It's FANTASTIC. Seriously... go watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"For a SQUAD of an impressive-high-profile cast, not the best SUICIDE movie.","Initially stylish but ultimately ridiculous and chaotic, the DC comics-based adventure ""Suicide Squad"" also features some dubious moral values. Add to that the film's lurid atmosphere overall and its appeal, along with its appropriate audience, dwindles still further.And then, straight out of left field, there's Katana (Karen Fukuhara), a lady samurai whose deceased husband's soul is trapped in her sword. For no very clear reason, she winds up tagging along on the quest to quell the Enchantress' sibling as well.Writer-director David Ayer's film is barely passable while the action is chugging along. But scenes attempting to give moral shading to the characters -- and bonding them as a pseudo-family -- misfire completely. Viewers are supposed to be impressed by the fact that career hit-man Deadshot loves his young daughter, Zoe (Shailyn Pierre-Dixon), for instance. More persuasively, Diablo expresses his penitence for having misused the fire that shoots from his hands at will by refusing to employ this supernatural gift -- at least, that is, until the script really needs him to for the sake of an explosive finale.If there's any good news to be salvaged from this mess, it's that casting Viola Davis as a tough-as-nails government bureaucrat works quite well. Davis plays hard-bitten intelligence agent Amanda Waller. Waller's pet project is the creation of the combat team of the title, an ensemble of violent villains she's determined to spring from prison and put at the service of the government.Oh, did I forgot to mention, Margot Robbie? Come on, even the Joker fell for her surprisingly honest and accurate performance in this piece.Overall, enjoyable indeed. But nevertheless, for a SQUAD of an impressive- high-profile cast, not the best SUICIDE movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

An Above Average DC Film,"In preparation for the upcoming DC Film Birds Of Prey I decided to rewatch the first DC team up film starring Harley Quinn, Suicide Squad. This is my review for this film and what my opinion of the film was.Main Character
Will Smith plays Floyd Lawton AKA Deadshot in this film and he is really good in this film. Smith has lots of charisma in this role and he is actually one of the characters that you will care about in this film due to his emotional relationship with his daughter. He is also great in the action scenes and totally sells the character of Deadshot and I can't imagine anybody else in this role. Margot Robbie plays Harley Quinn in the film and if you could look at perfect casting then this one would be in there. She sells the craziness of the character and is full of charisma. Her and Smith have really good chemistry in the film and they do a really good job of sharing the lead roles in the film and it is the highlight of the film.Supporting Characters
I will admit I am not a huge fan of Jai Courtenay's work but there is an exception to very rule and I really liked his performance in this film as Digger Harkness AKA Captain Boomerang. He is just very funny in this film and I liked how sarcastic he is in his role, also the boomerangs are a unique weapon that are used to a good effect in the film. Jay Hernandez as El Diablo was probably the surprise of the film, he was the character I knew the least about in the film but was possibly the character I cared about the most. He is given an emotional arc in the film and it works as he is the least well known character in the movie. Though some of the characters didn't work at all, Joel Kinnamon plays Rick Flagg in the film and he is just really bland in the film, when you have all these larger personalities having this average soldier as the leader of the team just really didn't work for me. Cara Delevingne plays The Enchantress in the film and wow this is one of the worst performances in a comic book film I have ever seen, she is just cheesy as hell and an absolute shambles of a character in the film. Jared Leto plays The Joker in this film and similarly he goes well over the top and it comes across as really cheesy, plus he was really underused in this film and it makes him feel like a wasted aspect of this film.Story
Some of the characters in this film such as Deadshot and El Diablo have really good emotional arcs in this film to make you actually care about their characters in the situation that they are in. But this film could have really done with being a smaller scaled story, it makes no sense that this group of individuals are literally tasked to save the world. Also the first act of the film sets up The Joker as the villain of the film but then suddenly changes direction to focus on the more supernatural aspects of the film and it just really didn't work for me.Script
This script has some decent humour and drama that gets these characters by and for the most part makes them feel unique and very different as you have very different personalities from a hitman to half human half crocodile and that works. However, I felt like it was inconsistent between the amount of drama and humour and when this is used by the characters, sometimes there were points when it should have been full drama or full humour.Style
This film has some entertaining action scenes in it and as mentioned it is fun seeing the different characters use their different weapons in these action scenes. But there isn't really any tension in the action scenes as it is just a bunch of faceless henchman attacking the group in which you don't think any of the team are in trouble. Also there is some really terrible CGI in this film and one in particular towards the end of the film that is just terrible.Overall
Overall this is no doubt that this is an entertaining film, it is very loud and exciting but there just isn't that much to it and it is just an above average action film that if you aren't are a big fan of comic book films then this isn't going to win you over.Rating - 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Suicidal is making a Marvel - style movie without knowing how to do it,"This film is still coming from the worst thing that brought the superhero's genre from its horrific joker to its horrible script, the only thing I can stand out from this movie is the cool will smith performance taking that away all else is crap the garbage characters the trash plot and the end crap I don T recommend because I'm not one of them sleeping in the middle of a movie but this got that effect",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fantastic Movie,"This film is truly one hell of a fun and entertaining experience. The opening 15 minutes gave me goose bumps while seeing the origin story/introduction to the squad members. The fight/action sequences are spectacular and would stand up against any modern war movie, mirroring the skills David Ayer displayed in Fury. The story is easy to follow and explains well why people make the decisions they do (something that was missing in BVS) The actors were brilliant in their portrayal of the characters, mostly impersonating their New 52 comic book version, with subtle references to older versions. Will Smith and Margot Robbie were by far the stand out performers, Jai Courtney was a very funny Captain Boomerang and i found Joel Kinnaman to play a good Rick Flagg, a character who you have to like as they are a good guy, but is never really liked by the others. The integration with the rest of the DC universe was good, and one thing that people might not realize is that this film is really a sequel to BVS, and you really need to have seen that for this film to make complete sense. There was enough humor in the film to get a few laugh out loud moments but i would have liked more captain boomerang. So far this has been my favorite movie of 2016, which is something when you consider we have had Deadpool, Civil War and X-Men Apocalypse. I would recommend this film to anybody that likes fun, fast paced action movies, with humerus elements. Its not just a comic book movie, but if you are a comic book fan then i'm sure you will love this as much as me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Really enjoyable comic book movie,"Suicide Squad is a really enjoyable comic book movie but its not without it's problems. It's got a generic plot and a weak villain, who is extremely forgettable. Jared Leto doesn't get enough screen time. A couple of the Suicide Squad members are also forgettable and have little depth. But it also has a lot of action sequences that are well filmed and really enjoyable as well great direction from David Ayer. Its really funny throughout. Margot Robbie is a perfect Harley Quinn and Will Smith, Joel Kinnaman, Jay Hernandez and Jai Courtney all give great performances. The soundtrack is amazing and the music by Steven Price is really good. The CG is good.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Worst. Heroes. Ever.,"Suicide Squad (2016) has been split for DC fans on if it is good or not; I do not think this movie is great, but I do not think it is terrible either. I do like certain things in this movie, but it is not flawless, it does have many issues involving scenes being cut out or the premise not making complete sense sometimes.I will start by saying that my favorite characters were Harley Quinn played by Margot Robbie and Deadshot played by Will Smith; Margot Robbie did a great job portraying the crazy and funny personality that Harley Quinn has along with seeing bits of her relationship with The Joker, and Will Smith was cool seeing him as Deadshot being skilled at shooting people in strategic ways along with him having a nice emotional relationship with his daughter.Captain Boomerang played by Jai Courtney who was entertaining to watch, a character named Diablo was cool but needed more to do, and Killer Croc did not look that bad, but he did not have much to do. One cool character I wanted to know more about was Katana who looked cool, and had a cool story that was interesting, but needed to be used more on the mission. Rick Flag played by Joel Kinnaman was good, and Amanda Waller played by Viola Davis was good.To be honest, I liked Jared Leto's version of The Joker; he is weird, he laughs a lot, and he looks like a ridiculous person, and I like the relationship between him and Harley Quinn. The main problem is that he is barely in the movie, and only has some small scenes with some not tied into anything important to the main plot of the movie. The main villain Enchantress looks creepy, but she was a standard villain who has a standard plot with a cliché portal in the sky for the third act.The does feel weirdly cut together, and there are lines of dialogue that did not need to be in the movie, mostly because they are cringey or cheesy sounding. I know there were a lot of Joker scenes cut, but I wish The Joker were the main villain because it would be cool, especially since Harley Quinn is part of the Suicide Squad. Also, there are two cameos in the movie from two superheroes that were short and quick, but cool to see none the less.Suicide Squad (2016) is not the perfect DC movie, but I did find it entertaining to watch because the actors are trying in their performances, along with there being some fine action sequences. The movie is worth at least one watch, not the best DC movie but not the worst like most people say it is.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Kind of the best DC-Universe movie,"As far as movies within the DC universe go, this was the best (ish) so far. It's not a good movie, but the potential is showing. I liked it - but it was far from perfect.I liked how it started non-linear, but as the movie progressed they moved into a more traditional structure - taking away from the competitive edge.Characters were introduced twice, which was redundant. Just having them introduced through Amanda Waller's narration at the meeting would have been sufficient. Moreover, one member of the team did not have an introduction in the beginning of the film (let alone two), so when this character appears halfway the movie, you KNOW he/she will be dead within minutes.The soundtrack was phenomenal. The song selection was the best ever in a movie... but all the songs were cut off too soon, so you didn't get to stay in the mood they were supposed to set. They kept on playing a note or two, and right after you recognize the song they cut it away. This is REALLY REALLY REALLY annoying. Worst was the Eminem song, which they chopped up so the part that they actually played was robbed of its flow.And we must discuss the Joker, and Jared Leto's portrayal of the character. The character had a whole lot of build-up. Both in the movie itself, as in the marketing around it. Therefore, the actual LACK OF RELEVANCE he had to the plot was an UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT. Although Leto went totally method to get the part right, his acting came off more as imitating the Joker instead of being the Joker. And the design of the character didn't help. Maybe it's just some getting used to. But it's definitely not love at first sight.To end on a positive note: this has a slight edge on BvS and is indefinitely better than MoS. Plus, they made this before MARVEL made a Thundbolts movie. Kudos for that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Ruined by the fingerprints of studio interference and misogyny,Warner Bros have clearly learnt overreacted to the critical backlash aimed at bvs. This film is a ghastly car crash of a movie. It feels like the studio drove a garish bus of frat boys into the dark sleek car of David Ayer's original vision. What could have been a darkly comic film has been turned into a overly silly nonsense fest complete with very obvious reshoot footage which shoe horns in some really really bad slices of what the studio thinks passes for humour. It is in short tonally all-over the place as is the pacing. That tone in the reshoot footage also stinks of misogyny especially when it comes to Harley Quinn. A character whom it would appear David Ayer's wanted to be shown as a deeply damaged and complex character is reduced to a overtly sexual object spouting one liners. Just awful.,1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Enjoyable enough good and bad,Was looking forward to this one and it was enjoyable. Suicide Squad has some major strengths let down by weaker elements and maybe an attempt to included too many characters. First off the Squad are all great I was even surprised to find I liked Captain Boomerang quite a bit (I've rarely seen Jai Courtney get a character with anything good going) I'd love to see him again. Jared leto's Joker was pretty great with little screen time and no real reason for being in the movie to be honest. He should have had a much bigger role and another element completely removed which was the major down point of the plot. And seriously some of those lines from Enchantress. Despite being a cool character as an idea and depiction the movie would have benefited much more from Joker being at the spear point plus it would have played well with Harley. Great soundtrack and characters with a stellar cast as well as colourful. It just missed on a level and actually looked a bit TV series at points. Shame could have been great but was just decent. On a second watch the good points tabs out even more and really seems like some messing about with the storyline was done detriment to the movie - would have been totally different had the Joker been the threat (which he should have Leto was great) and forgot about all that cgi nonsense.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Another ""superhero"" movie......","Let me preface this by saying that I did enjoy Batman v Superman the first time I saw it in theaters. So don't down vote me because you think I'm some kind of Marvel fanboy(I can count on one hand the amount of MCU films I actually enjoyed)..But this is not a great movie. Already the ""fans""(read: fanboys) are outraged that it is getting bad reviews, but the fact is: It's getting bad reviews because it deserves it. It's a story about a group of people with special powers that has to learn to work together to stop a generic CGI army and close some kind of portal/hole in the sky. Just like The Avengers, X-Men: Apocalypse, similar to Man Of Steel, yeah a bunch of movies have done this.It starts out with a series of flashy montages that went on way too long, all of a sudden something happens and they skip ahead a bunch of chapters in a couple minutes. The pacing issues luckily ends there, and the second act is pretty enjoyable. One of the best characters from the first half of the movie disappears though which sucks, they could have solved that in a different way to keep the character in play.The third act is where it goes full on generic ""superhero"". And then it stops short. No real aftermath or anything.It does have a post credit scene, but it is totally negated by them dropping the Justice League trailer a couple weeks ago.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Beautiful Crash Landing.,"First I'm going to speak bluntly on the topic that consumes the media around this film. Warner Bros took the masterpiece that was the original Suicide Squad, butchered and mutilated it then slapped David's name on it. Now this may not be the original cut or anything similar to it but in Warner Bros attempt to recreate the film to fit thier incredibly poor vision, they actually made a decent watchable film. There are so many parts of this film that I genuinely enjoy, lots of high octane action, wonderfully choreographed combat, character development, and that classic dark DC settings, but there are also many parts that just don't fit right. To the films credit it sure as hell is better than any Marvel movie out there (not made by Sony) so let's all prey we get the cut the director and the audience deserve. #releasetheayercut.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Amazing Start But It Falls Apart,I'm one of the biggest DC fans out there and if there is anyone who wanted this movie to be great that person would be me. Unfortunately Suicide Squad doesn't really succeed the way me and many others had hoped. To put Suicide Squads problems in a nut shell the movie had a massive lack of story structure but this didn't occur until around 30 minutes into the movie I felt the introductions to the characters were very jumbled some characters had their backstory told at the start some in the middle some even near the end.This movie had all the building blocks of success but the middle and the end don't cut it. It is basically a few scenes jumbled and bled together to make on big fight scene. I'm really sad that DC still hasn't turned around their spell of average releases. We need an amazing movie again DC soon your making us DC fans look bad. Someone get Christopher Nolan on the phone!,5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Not Great, Not Horrible","Recently I went out to the movies and saw the film ""Suicide Squad"". Overall I enjoyed the movie a lot but there were also some critical errors. Before seeing the movie, I had watched previews of it and in the previews there was pretty much non-stop action. After seeing how good the commercials were for the movie, I thought that the whole movie was going to be non-stop action when in reality the movie was very slow to pick up and there was not nearly as much action in it as the previews had suggested, they had just put the all the small pieces of high intensity action into the couple minute previews, creating a lot of hype for the movie when in reality it was not like the previews at all. Another thing that I did not like about this film was how they sexualized Harley Quinn in it. Her costume consisted of a belly shirt that read ""Daddy's Lil Monster"", sparkly booty shorts and fishnet stockings. This portrayed her as a highly sexualized character and distracted from her story line, or lack of it. I also thought that the music choice for this film is one of the only good decisions they made. The entire film was full of songs that the audience would be excited about, such as Bohemian Rhapsody, so instead of organically creating the excitement the director stole the hype from the song. There were a couple things I did like about this film such as the intense special effects. With any superhero movie there must be amazing special effects and this movie did just that. My favorite part of the film was when ""El Diablo"" a character in the film whose power was that he can control fire was when he turned into a giant fire monster and fought the bad guy in the end. I thought that they did a good job on the effects for his character in that part of the film, it was very detailed and intricate and I was sad when he died. Another scene with good special effects was when they were all in the helicopter heading toward the center of the city to stop the Enchantress, and the helicopter was hit and they all went down. This scene was very detailed was captivating.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Review,"When I first saw this movie, I thought it was really good and intriguing. I love how fruity and animated the director would make at the beginning of the movie as well as at the end. Each character had a background and story which made it much easier for me to keep up with this. Many people believed that the movie jumped around a little too much from scene to scene, which I do somewhat agree with. However, it did not drastically effect my overall judgment of the movie. Obviously my favorite characters are Harley and The Joker.It would be nice to have a spin off for the two of them or even make a second movie connecting this one to the new one. I defiantly recommend this movie to others.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Suicide Squad: you may like you may not.,"Suicide squad is the third film in the DCEU (Dc Comics Extended Universe) this film takes place after the Film Batman Vs Superman. The film was about a team of super villains comprised of Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Deadshot (Will Smith), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), and others. The movie was an interesting take on some of the characters, Will Smith did an amazing job as deadshot and fit his personality well, that goes for Margot Robbie, and Viola Davis. The movie does feel a bit weaker with the cgi then BVS (Batman vs Superman) and MOS (man of steel) and a huge controversy is the Joker in this film, which is seen mainly for Harley Quinn's back story. The actor playing the Joker is Jared Leto And a lot of people do not like his over the top performance. I loved this movie even with the flaws but that is my personal opinion, and everyone has different opinions.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This is not that bad... But is not good either.,"When I hear ""Suicide Squad"" the first thing that comes to my mind is ""sick and dark humor with a lot of violence"" but the movie is not really like that. I'm saying that just because I did no like the jokes or that there is not enough violence in the movie that makes this movie in something bad, no. Actually, the humor is on point (yes, there are bad jokes and out of context too) the history behind some characters is good (others... well, I hope there is a sequel for them), but this movie needed something to turn in the awesome movie about villains that they told us this was going to be. I'm really disappointed about that, but I can't tell this was an awful movie.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not so bad,"Not sure why the ratings are down for this movie, it was kind of entertaining, a decent storyline, with some really good actors. It is a typical ""super heroes"" type film; only these are ""super baddies""! What more do you want film like this? It is very watchable. Perhaps OTT with the violence, but most films seem to be that way these days.

Wasted Potential,"This movie could have topped the charts worldwide, however the story here is responsible for the disappointment of the movie. While the movie here has the good concept of the suicide squad, it fails miserably is taking out the talent from the actors. It could have been funnier, and more than pop corn action film. However, the jokes were all delivered by Margot Robbie and here acting stands out here, if she wasn't in the movie up I would have rated the movie 5 or maybe 4 the reason is that I am watching suicide squad after watching The suicide squad and it is way too better than this one and you would have everything there which you would expect from a suicide squad.The vfx used was a turn off for me, it was not at all pleasant to the eyes. I could barely tolerate it in the end.And the way they killed the villain is very dumb, maybe a very cliche method, and old school method I would say.It could become your popcorn action one time watch movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Better than expected, but still not a great movie","So, yeah - it's a super hero movie. It doesn't suck the way a lot of people are crowing about, but it's not a masterpiece either the way a lot of other people are shouting.The good: I thought Margot Robbie's acting, without mentioning her accent, was pretty much spot on for what I would have expected from Harley Quinn. (I came close to naming my Harley Sportster ""Harley Quinn"" but then this movie started being advertised, so I named her ""Binky."") The plot made sense, even if it was a bit of a stretch here and there. Other people have complained about it, but I liked the music. I thought ""Spirit in the Sky"" was misplaced when it started, but whatever. Viola Davis plays a bad guy pretty well. I thought the actor who played Griggs (Ike Barinholtz) did a great job making us care about him and what happened. Jay Hernandez did a good jobs as Diablo. Most of the SFX didn't suck.The bad: Well, Margot Robbie's here and then gone again accent. (I could give her a slight break because I know how hard it is to carry an accent throughout a performance. But, OTOH, this wasn't a live show, she could have had an accent coach, and she got paid a lot more than I ever have, so no - no slight break.) For me the show screeched to a halt every time Leto's joker appeared on the screen. Man, I hated that characterization. It simply didn't work for me, even a little bit. Ditto Cara Delevingne - my Lord she is a terrible actress. And IMHO her body might look nice but her face certainly isn't all that. So, with the lack of a trace of acting ability coupled with not being gorgeous - she must be sleeping with someone to be getting these acting gigs. I simply couldn't buy her enchantress except when she was hidden under heavy makeup and CGI. Why the heck was Captain Boomerang in this story? He didn't add anything plot wise. At least Slipknot was there to show us the effectiveness of the ""persuasive device"" used to make the Suicide Squad go along.The ho hum: So yeah, once again Will Smith played Will Smith. If you like his ""Oh hell no!"" plus his ""now I'm going to speak slower in a lower register so you can tell I'm a serious and tortured soul"" then you will like his 1,000th (a made-up number to emphasize my point) rendering of this character.All in all, not a failed movie and not a master piece.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This Movie Hates Harley Quinn Fans,"This movie has lots of problems. Shoddy editing, nonsensical plotting, a random soundtrack whose only saving grace is the track by Twenty One Pilots (which isn't even in the movie proper, they shove it into the ending credits), etc. But the biggest problem with this movie & the reason why I consider it the worst film EVER to be based on any DC Comics property is the utter lack of understanding in regards to Harley Quinn. Film Harley has only the most superficial of traits associated with the real Harley Quinn and possesses none of her charm or depth. Yes, the real Harley Quinn is pretty and quirky, but what sets her apart from all the other cutesy psychos in fiction is her tragic side. We sympathize with her pain & struggles at the hands of Joker & want to see her overcome these obstacles and cast Joker aside. This film, on the other hand, glosses over all of that (even though the DCCU claims it's trying to be more mature) in favor of romanticizing an abusive relationship & turning one of the best female super-villains of all time into a groupie who doesn't even wear a real costume or brandish any sort of intimidating weapon. Film Harley isn't a real character, she's a piece of eye candy made to sell ""Daddy's Little Monster"" t-shirts. They wasted Margot Robbie's talent by giving her a shallow role & they wasted my time & money with two hours of the camera ogling at a girl in booty shorts & a tank top claiming to be Harley Quinn. She is not Harley Quinn and this movie is not good.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Enjoyable Watch on a Good Entertainment System,"Just wanted to say that I think people need to post how they watched a movie in order for us to take the review seriously, I mean this sort of a film looked awesome on my 55"" Sony Bravia in 3D with a surround sound setup, however if I was watching it on a 14"" laptop or 5m away from a small 32"" TV with no soundbar then it may not have been so appealing because this sort of audio visual movie is designed for maximum impact on a decent set up.Of course I can appreciate movies with an emotional content and a developed story, but these sorts of movies aren't the reason I bought a 55"" 4K 3D TV and have 5 full range B&W speakers. The fact was simply that while watching this movie on my awesome set up, my senses were so overloaded with the joy of the visuals, the booming soundtrack and explosive effects that at no point did I ever feel like questioning anything.So if you didn't find this thoroughly enjoyable because you didn't watch it on a decent set up then maybe you need to go shopping or just stay away from action/sci-fi movies. Okay yes the plot was a bit ridiculous and had a lot of holes but the effort in this movie was put into cool characters and pure raw audio visual entertainment.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Worst movie i've ever seen,"Stupid, repetitive (two helicopters crashes, two of them crashed one after another? what the f...?) and lifeless. DC's version of Guardians of the Galaxy (should i mention that the ""You messed with my friends"" line is an almost exact copy of the ""Nobody messes with my friends"" scene from Guardians?) is awful. It sucks, because BvS Ultimate Cut is decent, that's the tone they should've done. It's all just a clusterfuck, i'm sure the movie was better before the reshoots, but guess what? exactly like FOX and Fant4stic, the studio got in the way and made an unwatchable movie that lacks structure and pacing. The third act is the worst thing on earth, as it contains pathetic fight scenes and manipulative ""character moments"", at least BvS, a movie which also has an awful third act, is never boring even at a three hour runtime.

Extended Cut Review: Pretty much what I expected,"Please note that my review is only valid for the extended cut as I did not see this movie in it's theatrical version.To sum this up, this movie was exactly what I expected. The action scenes were entertaining, the story was not too complicated and it was simply a good time watching a bunch of bad superheroes working together to save the world. Lets be honest, this movie was not going to be a cult classic!The acting for Harley and Deadshot were outstanding. You could tell that these two were driving the movie forward and kept us on our seat. The chemistry between these two characters was fantastic. The rest of the cast did all right, but nothing too special.I loved how the movie was dark throughout. And as it should be coming from the DC Universe.The biggest letdown was that I expected so much more from the Joker. I like Jared Leto, and I think that he is an unbelievable actor. But to my taste, how he portrayed the joker wasn't that outstanding... But he did have huge shoes to fill from Jack and Heath before him.So to summarise, this was an all around entertaining film that delivered exactly what I expected. Good acting, great action, and Dark.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A nice idea executed with slapdash laziness,"Not nearly as bad as the critics are saying but it's certainly not good. This story about a bunch of misfit outcasts being thrown together feels strangely, thrown together. There have been reports that David Ayer penned the screenplay in just 6 weeks which would go someway to explaining the disjointed nature of the film. It is also common knowledge that there were plenty of re-shoots to ensure that Suicide Squad didn't fall into the pitfalls and traps of Batman vs Superman's overbearing murkiness. The aim was to inject some much needed humour into the caliginous world of the DC universe. Instead we end up with questionable editing and one liners which rarely raise a chuckle, often misfiring completely.A few re-writes and I really think they would've had something here. I really enjoyed the character introductions, with their fast funky visuals and vibrant graphics. The performances mostly range from OK to good, with Jai Courtney surprising everyone with his Aussie Capt Boomerang. It's just a shame the final act is an absolute, wince inducing farce. As are all Harley Quinn and Joker scenes. Leto's joker and Delevingne's Enchantress are the worst things in the film by a mile.I've seen Leto's joker described as 'the worst iteration of the joker so far' which isn't fair, as that would suggest there have been other terrible Joker's in the past. This is the first bad portrayal of the joker I've heard of... and it's woeful.A nice idea executed with slapdash laziness. A baby step up from Batman vs Superman but a step up none-the-less.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I love this movie,"I love this movie but I didn't when I first watched it. The music is great, the actors are professional and very convincing. I liked the joker and I'm not sure why others didn't. I enjoyed his portrayal of the joker because it was more true to the character than Keith's performance. Keith was amazing too but I feel there was no... goofiness which is what joker is. I can watch this movie anytime and I still enjoy it because of the music and the actors. I hated Waller at first but she has grown on me. Her performance as an actress is phenomenal same with Margot Robbie. I always appreciate when someone is good at changing their accent as she did. Really great all around, oh yea and Rick is ""drool like Homer"" I always love watching the witch as well. Such a good movie!

Style over substance,"I thought the trailers for Suicide Squad looked fantastic and was really excited to see this film but unfortunately this turned out to be a bit of a let down. When I think back to what the story line actually was and how I would explain it to someone I realise that it was all a bit confusing. Not in a perplexing or challenging way, but in senseless way that lacked real credibility. It felt like there was a great idea here, and with a heavyweight cast and some excellent visuals, the real possibility for something special. But it had no substance or execution. It felt rushed. A lack of genuine depth saw the latter scenes descend into farcical action sequences. The concluding action scene itself felt like stepping into an acid trip. Another feeling of - how did this get here?? Although I have made these personal observations I still rated this as a 6 because there are positives for the film, and overall it was visually an enjoyable experience. I thought Jared Leto was exceptional in his take on the Joker. He was menacing and unpredictable and I would have liked to have seen more. Margot Robbie was seductively playful and also enjoyably unpredictable. Viola Davis also deserves a mention for her sinister turn. Some of the visuals and action sequences were fantastic to watch. Overall verdict: Despite the huge build up this film really didn't deliver. Action sequences are lazily added to cover a lack of genuine plot. Despite the great visuals and some really enjoyable performances I felt my mind often drifting and wondering about why this was all happening. Essentially the action springs out of the premise of assembling a team to deal with a catastrophe but in doing exactly that create the catastrophe. It's a bit senseless as there was nothing to react to in the first place so the entire film's action is unwarranted and unnecessary because by the end there is no apparent or credible reason or explanation for any of it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Jumbled mess from start to finish,"Let me begin by saying I love DC Universe and despite its hate, I thoroughly enjoyed ""Batman vs. Superman"" and thought it was a pretty solid movie. I can't say the same for Suicide Squad. I was really looking forward to this movie but ultimately felt disappointed when I left the theater. This moving lacks in everything from acting, writing, storytelling, emotion, direction, editing, and even the sound mixing. Suicide Squad simply put is a jumbled mess, especially in the writing and editing department. Scenes are thrown together all over the place. There's no pacing and no proper ""arc"" to the story. We spend a significant portion of the movie introducing the characters but not enough time actually growing to like any of them. One of the things that really bothered me about the story line and pacing (related to editing as well) is that, there was no real motivation to initially form the Suicide Squad by Viola Davis's character Waller. She just happened to put them together, then immediately following there was a big, terrorist attack by the evil enchantress and her brother. She just then happens to have the Suicide Squad available. Wouldn't have it made more sense for the terrorist attack by the enchantress to motivate wanting to use extremist ""bad guys"" to fight her and not just conveniently have them? This is but one of many poor areas in both writing and editing of the film where things didn't make sense.Another thing that didn't make sense was Joker's involvement in the story. His character ultimately felt completely pointless to the storyline of this film. I almost feel as if they just threw him into this movie to make people want to see it because it would have the ""Joker"" attached. I firmly believe the writing, story, and editing would have fit better if they weren't trying to give us some silly and pointless side-plots with the Joker. This movie also spends too much time back-tracking on past events about how the characters go to where they are instead of actually letting us learn who they are by dealing with their predicaments and situations in the movie. I have no real comments about Leto's Joker because his character was ultimately wasted and he never really had his proper place in the spotlight. Furthermore Suicide Squad is way too aggressive in throwing in classic-rock soundtrack anywhere where it seemed fit. I can't believe this is something I have to make a point about, but it's so bad that I have to. I don't mind a solid soundtrack to a film, but Suicide Squad thoroughly abused it. Instead of tastefully throwing in classic soundtrack from time-to-time in an effort to tell the story better, the movie just abuses it, throwing in classic soundtracks wherever it seemed fit. Furthermore, they often use the music in at wildly inappropriate times, and also blasts over dialog to the point where you couldn't hear what the characters were saying. How bad does a AAA-budget Hollywood film have to be to not even have a proper audio-mix? I ultimately felt like this movie was trying too hard to piggyback off of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" with the success of their soundtrack instead of trying to be original about it.If you've actually seen this movie, ask yourself the following question; who was the main character of the film? Was it Deadshot? Or Harley Quinn? Or the Mexican guy with fire, or the lizard man? Did you even remember the names of some of these characters if you aren't some die-hard comic book fan? And can you also properly describe some of the characters and why they're important? The point I am making here; the movie is easily forgettable. It failed to tell me a story or make me care about any of these characters. In fact, it made me not care about some of the characters so much, that I either forgot their names overnight or forgot they were even in the movie. Are those the qualities of a good quality, Hollywood film? Now the movie did try in some ways to do this. They gave some backstory to all the characters, especially the big-names like Deadshot played by Will Smith. Will Smith was fighting for his daughter, and wanted to prove he was more than a ""piece of crap"" serial killer. But other than his character, who did they make us care about?Ultimately this movie is just a big mess. They tried to put too many characters in one film without us actually caring about any of them. This is easily a forgettable movie, which is a shame. It had a lot going for it. The action was solid, the costumes were solid, I liked most of the cast. But the story-line and character development were severely lacking. Follow by the the poor timeline of events followed by the mediocre editing makes this one film, I have to say you should pass on on this one. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Very entertaining guilty pleasure,"The point lost is because of an excessive and poorly chosen music soundtrack which was as distracting as an A list actor with a coke problem. The best example of this is the scene where the Suicide Squad members have been unshackled and are standing in a circle surrounding and given their personal items inside their trunks. Because of the great characters and dialogue, snappy comebacks and the transitional period this scene should have relied on those conversations and music should not have interfered. But the music supervisor decided to bath all over it with The White Stripes (as a fan they truly deserve better placement) and it was overwhelming, stressful and felt forced. Bad job music supervisor, you kind of ruined it for me... or rather, you did. Even in the movie trailer they let this scene go without music! Anyhow, the movie aside from the excessive music forced on the audience, was a blast the first and second time I watched it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"One Flaw, The Movie is Not Great","Suicide Squad wasn't as great as I expected. Not exactly a bad film, but this doesn't really age well after five years. It can have some good aspects like some good visuals. Margot Robbie's performance as Harley Quinn is quite entertaining. And it did have a great idea to be an exciting movie about a team of villains. But sadly, there can be others that does have a poor execution due to the story being predictable. There are instances it has given me questions than answers. The action isn't much awesome as promised. And most of the characters don't have their development. The most we have gotten is Deadshot. At least his backstory can be the most interesting of the film. In terms of my recommendation, I think it's safe to say there's another adult-oriented superhero themed movie that came out the same year I think it's best to stick with. Deadpool. This not only also have great visuals, but has a much better execution as an action comedy. But if you want to watch this movie anyway, I would set my expectations low for it. Well hey, at least there's Birds of Prey and another Suicide Squad that just came out this year. And maybe they'll be better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

It was good but could have been better,I am speaking as a fan of dc and a fan of movies themselves.for starters i do suggest seeing the movie i thought it was good but it could have been better.the movie to me seemed a bit off and out of balance and that was mainly due to editing.i would be watching a scene and then out of nowhere the person could move to a complete other side of the room it feels non consistent.another issue i had was with the commercials and TV spots that have been shown to us throughout the year because it doesn't fit the movie how in the trailers it was packed with action and felt like an upbeat anti-hero movie.while the movie itself felt more of a drama stle than full action.it is also very offputting when you see content in the trailers that isn't even in the movie or were changed i.e not a lot of joker and the bar scene.but i mean overall it was good with the acting and actors soundtrack and good scrip. i suggest to rent the movie first then descide if you want to buy.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Don't let the critics fool you,"So I went to see Suicide Squad yesterday. Let me start by saying that DC has taken a step in the right direction. What they have started to do is make the continuity of their movies work so that every movie is starting to tie in. Much like everyone in the past few weeks with the release of the Batman V Superman: DOJ I watched the movie again. I still have no love for Zack Snyder. It is apparent that he has an intense dislike for Superman and that he has a darkly smudge soul so he has no happiness but it is glaringly apparent that he has some kind of direction. He just needs to get the proper coordination. Moving past that David Ayer, who is a fantastic director has a very dark and funny look on life and his take on the Suicide Squad is a refreshingly view at what makes a bad guy. Is it what they do or is it what they are? The answer may surprise you. The movie tries in ways to be fun and other times darkly serious. If you are looking for a Marvel funfest of bright colors and showy fights then you are in the wrong movie. It is dark and scary. Gruesome and gritty. I wouldn't let a kid see this because it is exactly what you would expect a movie about villains doing villain things to be like.Positives: 99% percent of the featured cast. Stand outs were Will Smith, Viola Davis, Margot Robbie and Jared Leto. The action scenes were dynamite and the cameos by the 2 heroes were perfectly shaped into the plot. The dynamic of the Joel Kinneman and Will Smith was very interesting to see. Viola Davis captured the essence of Amanda Waller. My wife thought that Margot Robbie's turn as Harley Quinn was not a stretch for her because she can't be that cute and not be crazy. (Arleen Sorkin should be proud of her). Jai Courtney made me like Captain Boomerang and not think of him as a cheesy villain that fights the Flash.Negatives: Katanna seemed to be a forced character in the movie. The story lost a little pace and the marketing department used too many of the great scenes as trailer bait so there was a lot of spoilers due to the trailers. Overall as a comic book fancier, I give it a 8 out of 10. The DC universe will have to bring everything back together in the upcoming years to correct the missteps that they have started to make up for it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I must be one of the few who actually thought it was a decent movie,"Despite being an avid comic-book reader, and also a firm believer that Heath Ledgers Joker could not be topped, I actually liked Jared Leto as the joker. People say they felt it was too forced, but i disagree. He took his own twist on the role, as the DC universe has done countless times in the comics. Some Jokers are bad ass mobsters, while others are hilarious psychopaths with little to no regard for the people around them. Leto portrayed this joker as the latter, and i think he was amazing. The super dysfunctional relationship between him and Harley Quinn was my favorite part of the entire movie, if we look away from the fact that Will Smith absolutely killed his role as Deadshot, but come on, its Will Smith. Of course he nailed it.All in all, my personal opinion is that it was epic. The Joker laugh, Margot Robbies awesome portrayal and my favorite line; ""whats for dinner?""If there are any spelling/grammar mistakes i apologize.

Not good,This movie was made for the money. It's really bad,,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Good for what was given,"*Spoiler Free*Have to start by giving credit to Viola Davis, Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Jared Leto. The poor direction and dialogue given by Ayer is clear, faults which could have been solved during writing or could have been overlooked if it wasn't for the embarrassing editing. Nevertheless, these four actors did they're best with what they were given. There is no doubt in my mind that Viola Davis stole the show for me. Although there were times where her lines seemed corny and lacked the class portrayed by Ms. Davis, her delivery was solid and she was the closest thing to the comic figure that we could have hoped for. Will Smith again showed everyone why he is such a successful actor, strong presence and ability to lead the cast was evident. However, his character plot let him down. Will Smith seemed to be playing Will Smith, not deadshot. There was the witty commentary and one-liners, which we have come to know with Will Smith, but his character did not develop and did not ever push any boundaries to showcase Will's diversity. I expected Margot Robbie to steal the show, but she simply wasn't given her opportunity to.Some of her dialogue,was again,corny. The adverts portrayed her as this strong woman, but quite frankly, she is just depicted as some eye candy and had no real depth to her character. Her accent changed constantly throughout the film and some fight sequences seemed forced.With proper direction from Ayer,Margot Robbie would have been outstanding.My final favorite was Jared Leto's Joker. Although it seemed like he was put into the plot just to have him in the movie, the little that was shown of the Joker was definitely impressive. I was team Ledger, I was not looking forward to the new 'gangster joker,' but overall I was quite impressed for the screen time he was given.Perhaps it was slight weakness' in his performance which caused for so many of Leto's scenes to be cut, but from what I had been shown it was clear that he had put an immense effort into his portrayal. I can't say he was better than Heath Ledger, his character still lacks something which maybe could have been resurrected if he was given the chance, but Leto did a great job in showing his insanity and,in my screening at least, he genuinely made the audience uncomfortable by his actions. It wasn't overdone and it wasn't like anything which had been done before, Leto's intimidating persona was intriguing and sinister.It's a shame that Leto's interpretation clashed with Ayer's. This is the Joker which should have been shown in all his brief appearances, but shout out to David Ayer for forcing Joker,and Harley, to be half of that attached high school couple who couldn't be apart. Jared's commitment and work for being a tortured maniac was pushed to the side for some HarleyxJoker cuteness which wasn't that necessary. The rest of the cast really had no relevance to the story line. The plot was poorly executed and had some stupid mistakes when portraying the villain. I wondered why they even bothered which such a large team as they had no impact on the story or the audience. The only other characters who had some interest to me were Jai Courtney, who provided a comical quality to distract from the plot holes, and Ike Barinholtz, who seemed to derive a stronger performance from those he worked with. Overalll, it wasn't terrible. The cast has such promise but was let down by Ayer's careless editing and use of inappropriate song placement. It's as if Ayer decided lets let the music speak instead of the dialogue (which was fine at times but after awhile we all wished that they would cut off the music). If they had slowed down the film progression, given the characters some depth and actually shown what was in the trailers, then this movie would have been the film of the year. Let's all just hope the extended cut is released and does the cast justice for their efforts. I also hope that Jared Leto and Margot Robbie are picked up for a spin off movie that does justice to their comic book characters and own abilities.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Joker is a joke!,"Don't know where to start, but I do know how this review will finish. Lets see... First of all I really don't like Will Smith, but I do respect his work, and I have to say that he did a very good job in Suicide Squad. In other words he is the only good thing in this movie, next to Jay Hernandez (Diablo) who was awesome by the way. The rest of the crew should try working in other lines of work. The story of this movie was probably written by the retarded monkey and handed to David Ayer who was drunk and high at the same time when he got it. Now, what can I say about Cara Delevingne. You really have to be a stupid mother***ker to give her a role in this kind of movie. I don't even understand why did I watch it after I read that she and bunch of some other ""actors"" get to act in it. And finally, the best for last - Jared Leto aka ""Joker"" aka Get the *uck out!

Disappointing,"So the trailers had me believe that this is actually a great film. David Ayer had me believe that as well with his career. So what happened? Well, DC decided to screw things up in the editing, not realizing, the movie wasn't any good either while it was still being written. I am not putting the blame on Ayer, he apparently was trying to make something better, but I am, however, dumping all the blame on DC and also Warners who probably did not care as much. I know a rant like this won't help but I really wanted to like the movie and...they disappointed me with the final product. Also, I don't understand how can people be so blind about the film's quality. I did not really care about the characters. I don't see what is so awesome about Harley.

A Disappointment!,"Based on the DC Comics antihero team of the same name, 'Suicide Squad' comes with BIG hype & expectations, but sadly, this superhero flick lacks the bite. No, its not as lifeless as Batman v Superman, its much better than that, but overall, the zing & the madness are missing here. It has merit, but not enough to camouflage its flaws.'Suicide Squad' Synopsis: A secret government agency recruits a group of imprisoned super-villains to execute dangerous black ops missions in exchange for clemency, which inevitably leads to chaos.'Suicide Squad' begins awesomely & the antiheroes are introduced with style & flair. But as soon as antiheroes step out into the city to stop havoc, the film just falls flat. Thats mainly because the film doesn't do much with its characters. The supposed ""Worst Heroes EVER"" (as promoted in its posters), are reduced into normal heroic tools, who indulge in ultraviolet confrontations with the opposing rival. Oh and coming to their rivals, The Enchantress, is a weak antagonist, who doesn't emerge powerful or intimidating enough. Also, why is the Legendary Joker reduced into a cameo? The Joker isn't a part of the 'Suicide Squad', in fact, he appears as a minor sub-plot for Harley Quinn, whom he's out to save amongst the violent state.David Ayer's Writing & Direction weaken 'Suicide Squad'. Though Ayer succeeds in making the film look comic-bookish & begins the film with on a really strong note, his Writing stagnates after a point. As mentioned before, the characters remain underused & there is a sense of potential being shun away. Ayer's Writing needed to be far stronger. His Direction, on the other-hand, is fine at places, but isn't consistent, as the pacing shifts as does the narrative. Roman Vasyanov's Cinematography is decent. John Gilroy's Editing is alright. Graphics are fantastic & so are the Action-Sequences. Steven Price's Score is excellent. Art & Costume Design are top-notch. Make-Up deserves a special mention.Performance-Wise: 'Suicide Squad' has a huge ensemble cast, but its Margot Robbie as Harleen Quinzel / Harley Quinn, who steals the show completely. Robbie is absolutely sensational as the whacked-out yet sexy & unpredictable Harley Quinn, who's romance for The Joker appears real. The terrific actress owns the screen, each time she appears on. Following her up in a surprisingly short & under-written role, Jared Leto puts up an impressive portrayal of The Joker. Comparing him to the Mighty Jack Nicholson or the Late/Great Heath Ledger, wouldn't be fair, as he's barely given much time here & he's not giving the same personality, this is a very gangster version of The Joker. But, overall, he can surely be looked forward too in another, bigger role of the legendary villain. Will Smith as Floyd Lawton / Deadshot, plays it right, & its good to see him loosen up a little. Jai Courtney as Digger Harkness / Captain Boomerang, gets limited scope, but he does well. Jay Hernandez as Chato Santana / El Diablo is barely there, while Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Waylon Jones / Killer Croc, who's completely under make-up and graphics, is wasted. Cara Delevingne as Dr. June Moone / Enchantress, doesn't work. Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag, is alright. Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, is authoritative, as always. Ben Affleck returns as Batman for a cameo & he looks the part even more now. Others lend support.On the whole, 'Suicide Squad' disappoints, despite a few pluses.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A star is born,"The third time was the charm with ""Suicide Squad"". I've seen it twice before but tonight was the first time that I really enjoyed. It does have its problems but it's all okay because it also has Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. Robbie was born to play Harley. She dominates every scene that she's in. She's awesome. The rest of the cast is also very good, especially Will Smith. Smith gives an excellent performance. The cast is so good that most of the movie's flaws are forgiven.

Me to critics: Seriously... what the hell is wrong with you people? Critics: We are the bad guys.... its what we do.,"Since the comic-con trailer leak last year, well everybody has been going nuts (no question there) over SS. BvS turned out to be an okay fare and would've stayed that way until that 'Martha thingy' which just ruined all the fun for me.This is a Will Smith movie and boy he is solid as Deadshot! Surprisingly JK's Rick Flagg does a marvelous job as well and both Deadshot/Flagg chemistry is something to look for on-screen.Many say Margot Robbie was born to play Harley. Yup, right! Her love or I'd like to call madness for Mr. J and subsequent descend into crazy is portrayed compellingly. To those complaining ""no screen time for Joker"", to them uhh.. I say ""get a life"" cos The Joker is not integral to the movie plot, he's more here as a treat to the fans and reference to Harley Quinn's story arc. In no way, NO WAY, does JL ever comes close to the Ledger's version (no one can surpass that).. not in this lifetime!!The real show stealer for me was El Diablo. Firstly, he's super cool with his pyro power and secondly he's just.. super cool. Other characters were fab too; Katana (ass-kicker), Croc and Boomerang (not much to do tho).The new hottie Cara Delevigne as Enchantress was a delight. Been on her trail after having watched PAPER TOWNS (don't judge). Overall a complete entertainer, good 3D, action, humor, & soundtrack.Special praise for Viola Davis's character as Amanda Waller -- one cold hearted bitch she turned out to be. David Ayer kudos!

Very Average,"I just got out of a local premier of this movie and I set-up this account to give my first every review.OK now we got that out way.. For all the action this is a very boring movie. A weak plot, obvious script and average directing see this movie packed with quality actors fail. Robbie and Letto seem to be the only interesting actors/characters and will almost guarantee a spin off based on their good chemistry. Will Smith as deadshot comes off as a nothing character who's angst is framed around a story line that we've all seen to many times.

It was my most anticipated movie of 2016 - not disappointed,"I went to this movie with couple of friends on premiere day in my country. I was very excited to see it and I'm not gonna lie, I was not disappointed.One of the biggest movie's strengths are characters. I loved every Suicide Squad member - their presentations were really good and enjoyable to watch in my opinion.I know this may be controversial but Jared Leto as a Joker delivered A+ performance and the chemistry between him and Margot was amazing. Too bad we didn't see him for a long time.Enchantress(Cara Delevingne) - I'm in love with Cara and I'm really proud with how she performed. Maybe character development was pretty meh but Enchantress had her bad ass moments for sure and Cara was perfect as an Enchantress.OVERALL 10/10 characters, good action, basic but interesting plot line with some humor. I highly recommend this movie and DON'T LISTEN to these critics. It's definitely worth your time :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not a good movie,"This is a bad movie. Don't watch it. I heard and read bad reviews about it and still I decided to watch it. Big mistake.All the main characters of the squad (that were in jail) are meticulously described in the first part of the movie, it's so boring you can't wait for all of them to be introduced, after that you expect them to be the only people joining the team, but then two other characters appear out of nowhere, with a 5 seconds introduction each, they are combating the same monsters and part of the same squad but apparently not as important... It's nonsense.That's just one small thing that really annoyed me at first but then everything else was bad.If you know the series Power Rangers... That is the Spoiler right there. The fighting moves and the enemies were just as stupid. There was so much kicking and punching you question the ""power"" of the witch that released them.I could go on and on about all the things I didn't like about this movie, which would include the TERRIBLY thought out plot, HORRIBLE acting from ""the joker"" and POOR dialogues.This is not a movie to watch, don't do this to yourself.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Joker and Harley Quinn shine in this otherwise average movie.,"Suicide Squad was a very average, border line below average, take on the new ""Super Team"" fad that has been going around Hollywood. The action wasn't anything special and there was plenty of cheesy superhero moments (i.e. Diablo's line ""I already lost one family, I'm not losing another!""). Most members of the Suicide Squad are just down right uninteresting. Save for Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn and Will Smith's Deadshot. Although Deadshot turned out to be a cliché, it was still a good performance by Will Smith and by no means boring to watch. However this movie truly shines when The Joker, played by Jared Leto, and Harley Quinn are on screen. Especially when the two of them are on screen together. The two characters have an absolutely insane relationship and feed off of each other's craziness/creepiness making them a blast to watch on screen together. The only problem is there's not enough of that in this movie. I realize that this movie isn't solely focused on those two, but it should be. They are by far the most entertaining part of this movie and really carry this other wise unremarkable movie. If you are expecting a Heath Ledger type of Joker then you will be disappointed. Where as Ledger's Joker is more of an anarchist who wants to cause chaos in the criminal underworld, Leto's Joker dominates it. This version of the Joker is a very accomplished criminal and basically an underworld kingpin. But yet he still manages to maintain just the right amount of insanity in every scene he's in. Another problem with this movie is the director and writers seem to have forgotten that the members of the Suicide Squad are supposed to be bad guys. None of them really feel like villains. My only gripe with Harley Quinn was she wasn't as ruthless as she should have been, especially when compared to the Joker. As far as setting up more events in the DC universe, this movie pretty much does what you expect. Overall if you really wanted to see this movie, I still would, but if your'e on the fence maybe wait for a cheap showing or rental.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
They are bad guys! It is what they do...,"While I am not overly much fan of the superhero genre as such, then ""Suicide Squad"" was sort of a most welcomed addition to the genre. Why? Well because you have a group of less than savory characters gifted with super powers, so you don't have to witness a group of goody two shoes running around trying to save the Earth while doing what is morally and ethically sound and politically correct. It was refreshing to have a bunch of baddies running around and dealing out punishment while trying to save the Earth. Yeah, it still has that oh-so-glorious-saving-the-Earth element to it.Now, ""Suicide Squad"" falls right into the same alley as Christopher Nolan's darkly set Batman movies, and it fits right in there. Oh, and Batman is actually also in this movie, so go figure...While the movie is titled ""Suicide Squad"", it might as well have been named ""Harley Quinn"" or something like that, because this movie was essentially about her because she was so often the focal point that most of the other bad guys (read protagonists here) sort of fell a bit in the background and were looming in her shadow.The movie does have some interesting characters. First and foremost, and which is not a shocker nor a surprise to anyone, is Harley Quinn (played formidably by Margot Robbie). Now I am not familiar with her character from the comic books, so I have no base of comparison, but what I saw in this movie was impressive.Then there is Killer Croc (played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), whom actually was a surprise of a character, because I had initially written the character off as being just another brawny goon. But it turned out that the character was quite interesting.Right up alongside Harley Quinn in terms of being interesting was Enchantress (played by Cara Delevingne). That character design, when she was in her shadow-form, was amazing. And it was actually one of the most memorable and impressive of characters that I have seen in a superhero movie, and would definitely like to see a spin off movie with this character - and also a movie with Harley Quinn, of course.Deadshot was also an interesting enough character, but I think that having cast Will Smith for the role was not the right actor. Sure he is talented, but he just didn't sit well with me in this particular role.Katana was also a character that had potential, but the character wasn't really fully utilized or put to proper use throughout the course of the movie. And it is also a character that would be suitable for a solo movie. The actress Karen Fukuhara was a great choice for the character, and she more than lived up to the part. Just a shame that the character was sort of cut short on screen time. However, the name Katana is just stupid. Why name yourself after your choice of weapon? Sure, I get the part with the katana stealing the souls of the ones killed by its blade, but come on...And while we are on the characters, then I must say that I was struggling hard with taking Jared Leto serious in the role as The Joker. It was mostly because of the teeth grills. It just made the character look like a pathetic white wannabe gangsta. And it was totally unjustifiable for the iconic character that The Joker is. Certain aspects to Jared Leto's performance was good enough, but I just couldn't look past his pathetic appearance, and it took away so much from the character and its importance to the movie.""Suicide Squad"" is an entertaining action movie for what it turned out to be. It is not a movie that challenges the intellect of the audience in the least. This is pure and simple a lean-back-and-enjoy-the-action types of movies. And that is adequate enough, and director David Ayer did a good enough job with this movie.The effects in the movie were good and they more than lives up to the things they were supposed to bring out on the screen. And for a movie such as this, then special effects and CGIs that are realistic and believable is important.""Suicide Squad"" is definitely a movie that was needed to the superhero genre, just like ""Watchmen"" was back in 2009. Just keep in mind that this is a predictable movie, driven by one-liners, special effects and quirky characters.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"DC, you've done it again (and not in a good way)","Suicide is another disappointing entry into the DCEU, as it threw away the potential for a fun, light-hearted story and instead replaced it with the dark tone (and some humour) we have come to expect from this film franchise. Will Smith is by far the best part of this movie, delivering us his usual, charismatic charm and addition to this, Margot Robbie, Jai Courtney and Viola are great in their roles respectively. Where the film falters in terms of performance however, is through Cara Delevingne's disappointing representation of Enchantress (in which she was given a role that was utilized in the story much more than expected/needed), Jared Leto as the Joker, where he just seemed to be doing a strange and unsettling impression of Heath Ledger's interpretation in his surprisingly small and compressed role and other side characters seemed entirely underused (for example, Katana, Slipknot (who was added to the team for the sake of moving the plot along) and Killer Croc). Also, unfortunately the relationship between the characters, Rick Flagg and Enchantress seemed entirely forced and just completely unnecessary. Onto the ""cool soundtrack"" that was promised prior to the film's release, it was was unfortunately very overused as the began to cut off song-after-song and just play another one straight after which had nothing to do with the plot at all (some did however, which was pleasing). One of the antagonists turned out to be nothing but a fake-looking, CGI sh*t-fest with no motivation other than he wanted to take over the world (learn from your mistakes DC!) and the dialogue written into the script felt lazy and clunky and a lot of the jokes were hit-or-miss.

"This movie is imperfect, yet fun. A great time at the movies","The third installment in the DC Extended Universe, ""Suicide Squad"", was almost an antithesis of the movies before it. Director David Ayer was clearly taking notes when people were criticizing ""Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice"". This movie goes out of its way to create new characters that you could truly care about, even at a small level. Will Smith and Margot Robbie managed to fully embody the characters from the comics they are based off of, while also bringing something new to the table. And of course, there is the matter of Jared Leto's Joker. This was first portrayed on the silver screen in 1966. However, 50 years later, Jared Leto manages to make all of the viewers feel as if they are watching a brand new character. He makes no attempts to stack up against Nicholson or Ledger. He creates a character all his own. To the movie critic, this movie may seem imperfect. Many filmmakers would have did this movie very differently. However, to the comic book fan and the average moviegoer, this movie did very well. It is a fun movie, and to sit down and watch this movie is just a treat. If you watch this, expect action and laughs.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Entertaining, and better than expected","With Superman dead, the world needs a new band of superheroes to step into the breach. Senior US Intelligence officer Amanda Waller comes up with a daring plan - use extreme criminals with special abilities to fight crime, in exchange for them receiving reduced sentences. The band of crime-fighting criminals is officially known as Task Force X, but due to the nature of their mission a more appropriate name would be Suicide Squad.Reasonably entertaining. Starts off very well - the background and scene setting were great and promised much for the remainder of the movie. Unfortunately, the remainder doesn't quite live up to this promise, as the plot loses focus to an extent.This all said, the movie has great momentum and is never boring. There are some great action scenes and dialogue and the performances provide a great energy to the movie. The standout (for many reasons!) is Margot Robbie who is excellent as Harley Quinn. Jared Leto is great as The Joker (the character seems to inspire great performances - thinking Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger in the past). Solid work too from Will Smith, as Deadshot, and Viola Davis as Amanda Waller.After all the criticism of the movie, it was much better than expected. I can only think it was your typical comic book and superhero movie fans who were disappointed, as this movie is a bit different to most of the genre. I've never read the Suicide Squad comics, and generally am not a fan of comic book / superhero movies, so was able to watch with any preconceived ideas of what this should be like.

"So far, one of this year's worst.","Ugh. What a waste.It's baffling how the marketing of this film, especially the trailers sold me on how fun and exciting this movie looked. Whoever cut those trailers absolutely deserves an Academy Award. To make this garbage of a film look any good must have been quite a feat.Lets get straight to it, the whole film is about a team that unwillingly comes together by the shady side of the government in a really long and drawn out series of flashbacks and origin hoopla that has you so bored that you end up wondering what the movie is about. Oh yeah and there's this lame witch villain, Enchantress that is handled so very poorly.On top of it, there's an unnecessary Joker & Harley Quinn romance stuff going on, which weirdly doesn't end up involving anyone else. It's like a strange side story that happens while the main story is going on.It's giant narrative mess. It's very choppy, very muddled, and doesn't do a good job explaining anything within the middle of the action. There's no sense of danger and the film shoehorns in forced humor, therefore making tonal inconsistencies that took me out of the film every so often.It's very clear that WB banked on Will Smith's star power, and the popularity of Harley Quinn. Aside from those two and maybe El Diablo, Rick Flagg and Amanda Waller, no one else has anything to do. More time could have been developed for other members of the squad, but they're just in the background. I got to sympathize with Deadshot the most, but I wasn't really captivated because it was exactly the role I expected him to play.Jared Leto, Margot Robbie, Viola Davis and the others do the best with what they're given, but ultimately decent acting from some of the cast members won't change the fact that it's a terrible disjointed film.Clara Delevingne's Enchantress was a monumental waste of a villain. The script just uses her as that tried trope of a world ending threat that we've seen so many times. The film does nothing new with it, nor does it try to do it well, even if it is a familiar trope. Her acting was just so atrocious and laughable. As stated above, Jared Leto's Joker doesn't have much to do. His arc of the film with Harley has nothing to do with the main story so it's just a distraction. I had no problem with his portrayal, but the film really did not need him at all.For me David Ayer is a hit or miss. While I have enjoyed a few of his previous works, especially End of Watch, he failed to deliver with this film. It's lazily written, with terrible dialog, the story is incredibly choppy, and even the action sequences disappoint. Don't even get me started on the finale. It's half-assed and so anti-climactic. There was no sense of danger or any tension. Ayer once mentioned how we will see the squad bond with their hatred of Batman, and that we will get the villain's perspective on Batman, but aside from Deadshot, that wasn't really explored at all. Also those eyeball creatures, they were lame. I mean visually was that really the best the filmmakers could come up with?I don't want to make comparisons, but this film made me realize and appreciate what Guardians of the Galaxy accomplished. Taking a bunch of C/D-list characters that aren't the best people in the world, and making something out of them. I don't want to start a fanboy war, but it amazes me that Marvel Studios who have been at such disadvantage since the start, pull off what they did. Making films that are at the very least entertaining is quite impressive, compared to WB/DC that have had the film rights to these properties for such a long time. I don't mind that they're playing catch up but there's a way to do them well.It is very discouraging as a comic-book fan in general, but I'm still hoping that DC's future will take into shape. I've made it clear that I am not a DC hater. I've stated numerous times I loved Man of Steel. I saw it five times in theaters and could not anticipate DC's future, but so far I was disappointed by Batman v Superman, now today, I am massively letdown by Suicide Squad. I'm hoping Patty Jenkins Wonder Woman will change my tune and that Snyder will deliver with Justice League.At the end of the day it's all subjective. If you enjoyed this movie, more power to you, my review doesn't make me the end all be all. But, aside from some okay performances, a very tiny Batman role, and a cool surprise appearance from another DC hero, you should save your money. Just go see a decent summer film like Star Trek Beyond or Lights Out. Or just go watch Captain America: Civil War and Deadpool, comic-book films done extremely right.4/10",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Enjoyable but not perfect,"Just watched the Midnight premier and here are my quick thoughtsWhat I LikedMargot Robie was excellent as Harley Quin, I was expecting it to be more of a Joker and Harley movie butWill Smith carries the movie well as Deadshot, he is more or less the leader....Jared Leto's Joker..... it starts off pretty great, but the more they show him and what his motives are (which I still don't know) the more you start questioning whether or not you like him, not sure if thats a good thing or not...What I did not LikeIntroduction to each character was rushed and thus there is minimal or little character development.You just get dished out a spec sheet of who they are and then expect to feel for them using flash backs... which works for some characters but definitely not all of them, and you'll know which ones after seeing the movie.The Villain was bad (no pun intended), half of the villains team gets randomly shoved into the movie without any back story. When I say team, I mean one out of the two antagonists... to vaguely put it without spoiling anything.Some of the lines and dialog felt out of place.... again, can't say without spoiling.Lots more to talk about but those are my quick no-spoiler thoughts.Honestly, would give this a 6.5 but 7 will suffice.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
5/10,"Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) is convinced that after the arrival on earth of Superman and the discovery of meta-humans, the only way to fight the potential menace of the next threat is to assemble a team of the worst and most powerful criminals in custody and use them as, fittingly, a 'Suicide Squad'. That is when elements like Deadshot, the best killer on earth, (Will Smith), the mad Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) amongst other come in.The reasons to be excited were many, for one the premise and the way it was pitched by Ayer and Warner Bros. to the public sounded really intriguing. The end result is a totally messy film, falling short on many of its promises, a film which even in its ideological statement doesn't know what it's saying, yet that has enough fresh material and good details to not prove to be the disaster it could seem.What Ayer achieves here is managing to make many extravagant characters fit on screen. The fact of making this coherent is both a gargantuan task and one that isn't fulfilled by the movie, but we'll come back to that. You at least have to admire the bravery in trying to bring all of this craziness together and you do because when the film is working, it is working great, the problem is that tonal shifts happen so abruptly and so often there is simply no time to enjoy a film that I think is, for the majority, really enjoyable, but made less so, many many times, by terrible pace, sloppy editing and again, tonal shifts that even make for unpleasant ideology at times.The movie tries to be a serious drama, but its inner core, which is that of a black comedy, is so powerfully clear is struggles to get out and fails to be relevant. A part of this I have to admit has to be blamed on the unnecessary inclusion of the Joker character here. He is completely misused for many reasons, but the worst part is the fact that he takes away a big chunk of time from the flow of the film and disrupts the tone of it. Having a cameo would have been more than fine because he does work in the few flashback scene has, yet his integration into the plot is simply boring. Not to mention the fact that Leto's portrayal is absolutely out of control and does not leave you with anything consistent, proving that the Joker isn't just some mad idiot you pull off by playing crazy and laughing mad on screen, He is a deep character with a serious set of traits that has to be understood and studied.Far less boring is his counterpart: Harley Quinn. Brilliantly portrayed by Robbie, Harley represents everything about what is good in the film. The comedic undertones, the savage nature, the overall arc with the Squad and the chemistry with her companions, especially Will Smith. Those are all the elements that I really enjoyed and grasped from the film. Ayer had a real eye for detail and he managed to pepper the script with thousands of little touches that were gold character beats and proper development of story.Yet then you are reminded of the plot going on and you can't help but frown. The villains in this film are pathetic, both in execution, but even worse in basic set-up. Did anyone of the thousands of people reading the script wonder if another fuc*ing beam creating a portal into the sky was what we needed? And even worse why is the Suicide Squad fighting such a threat in a world where Wonder Woman, Flash and Batman exists. It is beyond me. You had the possibility of doing something really fresh and new, lowering the stakes and making the character conflict come to the forefront and what we end up is another beam in the sky? As much as I was enjoying the little moments I just couldn't believe it, it got me out of the film too many times and the way the resolution works was probably the dullest element of it all, failing to make any of the characters relevant in the scenario...ahem..Captain Boomerang.I was laughing and enjoying myself, there was some real, clever and original banter going on. The sarcasm and dark nature of the characters was working brilliantly, Jai Courtney was stealing the show from Robbie and then Smith would come in and steal it from both of them. And then Amanda Plummer (minor spoiler) shoots four members of her staff. And then suddenly it is OK to be a assassin as long as you love your daughter. The thematic and ideological points are so chaotic I had no idea which way to tackle them.Whilst a definite improvement over Snyder's underwhelming work in the DCU and having some truly remarkable elements and redeemable qualities, ""Suicide Squad"" has too messy of a message and a story to really manage to be the fresh take it promised to deliver.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Even the over acting of Jared Leto as the joker, an actor that i've always loved, but here he tries so hard to make something different than his predecessors that he ends up making something that is not different than a regular gangster, with no presence and not timeless at all.

"Critics were drunk, I can assure you that","This movie is slow, I agree but it had to be because not everyone has read the comics.All I have to say is that the bad reviews are so, so wrong given the performance of the movie. If you are a 10-year old marvel fan, this one is not for you, however, if you're 15 o over, this is one of the best comic book adopted movies I have seen. It is ""Straight Outta Comics"" show.Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was amazing and Will Smith has mastered Deadshot in the movie.I should say there isn't much about Jared Leto's Joker, given his less than expected screen time, but I liked what I say.Cara Delevingne is quite the biggest gossip diva and I shall admit her acting was up to the mark as well.I'm happy that David Ayer didn't make it a Comedy Circus we know as Captain America : Civil War",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not good but I enjoyed it.,"A bunch of super-powered villains are picked by the US government to protect the world against any potential super threats. However they each have a little bomb implanted in their throats. If they rebel or try to escape they'll be killed. Then someone named the Enchantress attacks and plans to take over the world (I think). The villains are let loose to battle her.This movie is pretty good for the first 30 minutes. It sets up the story and characters swiftly and neatly. Then when the Enchantress starts setting up her plot the film falls apart. It makes next to no sense! I kept watching it trying to figure out what the hell was going on! Finally I just gave up. I turned off my mind, settled back and watched things go BOOM for the remainder of the film. It SORT OF makes sense but not if you examine it too closely. The reshoots on the film are obvious and muddy the waters more. There's lots of action and violence and great special effects. I can't fault the acting. Everyone is good in their roles--especially Margot Robbie who steals the show as Harley Quinn. The only bad acting is by Will Smith as Deadpool. Very wooden and uninteresting. Also Batman and Flash pop up briefly, So is it a good movie? No but I had fun watching it. A 7.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Half-finished retail space,"By now you know this is the second in a row of collapsed artefacts by this studio. The sole reason they exist is that they woke up one day to realize their rivals had built a mall across town that was hoovering up all demand. So belatedly they rushed to built their very own but built haphazardly and by skimping on planning. On opening day, you note lights that don't work, wires still hanging from ceilings, ladders left behind by the construction crew, the place still half- finished.This is even less of a finished film than the one before. For long swathes it feels as if we're simply watching what could be salvaged at the last moment, what they had to go forward with after they couldn't tinker any longer. Still their choice for a narrative engine makes it far more watchable. This is the 'group band together for a common mission' format that goes back to Seven Samurai. There's a lesson here on narrative dynamics.The blueprint itself establishes forward momentum. We get the requisite scenes of introducing each one along with their oddball skills; it sets up the anticipation of seeing them in action together. The added irony is that they're bad guys who have to reluctantly do good. The rest is a bunch of action scenes en route to facing this month's super villain who threatens all life on earth.The only other thing I found interesting was Harley Quinn, this particular version of her anyway. She's the only one who manages to intrigue. Not this Marilyn Mansion version of the Joker, no, who is all tacky rockstar and no embodiment of whimsical chaos in the gears of the world like Ledger's.I'd like to think that someone in company meetings raised the idea of a William Friedkin-style love film about the two of them going on a spree of havoc first but was overruled by impatient bosses. They were apparently in a bit of a rush to give us another Joel Schumacher debacle.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
These worst heroes ever make for an entertaining blockbuster ride,"After a solid 12 months of some fairly loud hype, the ""worst heroes ever"" have finally been unleashed on the anticipating world in a film that in many ways will make or break DC comics plans for blockbuster domination and while David Ayer's much talked about film is not able to live up to all the expectations it has been fairly or unfairly burdened with, it's unquestionable that Suicide Squad is a silly and often deliriously fun thrill ride that will likely have popcorn munching audiences clambering for more.Filled with an array of colourful characters (debatably to many so) and tasked with combining them all together to make a cohesive and structured whole, End of Watch and Fury helmer Ayer struggles with the balancing act in the films opening stand and there's undoubtable teething issues for the film as it try's to introduce us to each member of this new fan-dangled squad of evil doers.The film bares scars of the reshoots and likely studio led editing suite meddling that went on behind the scenes and a raft of the squad's players get short shift and the films plot line barely has time to breathe before we are all of a sudden thrust into yet another big bad trying to destroy the world as we know it, which isn't fantastic as the films central threat and narrative drive isn't all that much chop and feels as though it may've suffered from the creative teams soundtrack shortlisting work rather than story polishing.These shortcomings however are quickly mostly forgotten about as the rag tag group of antiheroes begin to get their individual moments to shine as their mission takes hold and while as expected the film is mostly the Margot Robbie and Will Smith show there's ample joys to be found outside of Harley Quinn (and her uncomfortable looking hot pants) and Deadshot (laboured with one atrociously cheesy flashback sequence) with supports like Jai Courtney's Aussie larrikin Boomerang, Jay Hernandez's fiery Diablo and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's grizzled Killer Croc. The film could've almost doubled these side players on screen time without question, although with Smith and Robbie on such winning form it's easy to see why the film always reverts back to these key players.Suicide Squad's other participants all have varying degrees of success and shortcomings and in one case an hilariously short screen time.Viola Davis's cold and calculated government agent Amanda Waller is someone not to be messed with, while Cara Delevingne proves once more she's a model with great acting potential. It's perhaps surprising then that personally I found Jared Leto's Joker the most curiously hard turn to judge and taking the Heath Ledger factor entirely out of the equation, Leto's 10 to 15 minutes worth of screen time (those expecting the Joker show may be disappointed) as the crazed clown is a performance that will be interesting to see judged once the movie going public has had time to contemplate it, but overall it does feel like the films largest disappointment when it comes to hype verse delivery.It's not that Leto is bad perse, but there's something just not quite right about his grilled up incarnation of the beloved comic book figure although it could be argued that his vision of the killer clown is being harnessed and moulded for more of what's sure to come.Not a cinematic masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination and sometimes a frustratingly inert experience that was in need of a much better plot, big bad and perhaps even more memorable action ticks and pure spectacle, Suicide Squad will be lapped up by audiences around the world and should keep a large portion of its established fan base happy, as there's little denying the films fun factor when our crazy group of antiheroes take centre stage with the cast playing them is clearly having the time of their lives.The worst heroes ever therefore make for some far from boring guilty pleasure good times.3 1/2 downed choppers out of 5",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I expected more.,I really expected more from this movie. I won't spoil anything about the plot. But from the trailer everything has been pretty much about Harley Quinn and the Joker.. BUT the Joker has like no screen time. And what happened to all the jokes they were putting in after seeing Deadpool being such a success.. Lame and boring jokes that made me and the people I went with cringe big time. I won't go lower as 4 as the the rest of the movie was alright.

"Not ""Suicide Squad"" but ""Deadshot"" !","I think Suicide Squad is not a bad movie but it's just not a good movie. The movie is entitled ""Suicide Squad"" while it must be ""Deadshot"". After 20 minutes watching the movie I was fed up by watching Will Smith playing only what Will Smith can play. It was as the movie was written by him and for him. You're not watching Suicide Squad you're watching a photo shooting of Will Smith in a cosplay of Deadshot. Margot Robbie is a good actress and I find her well chosen for Harley Queen but HQ is my favorite character from all comics and here, she's sexy but not mad : she's just trying to be mad without success. The story is really insipid ... all the money was spent for the actors and it remains no money for the scenario ? For the next one, send me an email and I'll give you a free scenario hundred times better. The bad guys have been replaced by Care Bears. And is someone able to tell me why the Joker have been replaced by an ersatz of Maryline Manson ?

Only Harley Quinn is the only good thing I have!,"Meh! A film with an ugly editing, it wastes its characters and they don't help much either. The only thing I can rescue is Harley Quinn played very well by Margot Robbie.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Despite the film's numerous faults, Margot Robbie is spot-on as Harley Quinn.","In a ""black site"" buried amidst the swamps of Louisiana, the worst of the worst of criminals and evildoers are locked away. This collection of psychopaths are so murderous and irredeemable that - of course - they must surely possess the moral righteousness to work together as a team to stop extraterrestrial terrorists and save the day. Song after song (everything from Grace to Eminem) plays out to introduce each role, though the statistics that dance on screen aren't enough to build a worthwhile backstory. The audience is later subjected to numerous flashbacks to fill in more details (all of which only makes the personas less believable and relatable), as well as that cardinal sin of editing: the flashback to a scene witnessed earlier in the movie. The group of uncontrollable killers consists of Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Deadshot (Will Smith), Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Diablo (Jay Hernandez), and Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), each possessing a special skill or a super power - or just martial arts training or great strength.The editing - something along the lines of a music video - is part of what makes this whole adventure so dull. Countless scenes drop off as if excised not for time constraints but for disagreeable content; poses are struck and slow-motion is abused; and sequences build up to punchlines that fizzle out completely or escalate into a chaos of lights and sounds and CG frill. Writer/director David Ayer seems to have crafted a hard R-rated picture, only to have all of the edgier seconds ripped away, leaving unintelligible segues and a sense of goofiness to replace sincerity. ""Suicide Squad"" isn't nearly as serious as it needed to be, especially if viewers are meant to witness the acts of these crazies in awe; it's mostly clichéd dialogue, meager insults, and action that is too obscured by computer-animated monstrosities.""The world changed when Superman flew across the sky,"" insists Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), the human ringleader of the covert assignment - and a reminder that in any superhero movie, the U.S. government is usually the first to pose a threat. Perhaps the worst part of it all is the design of the antagonists, which defies description - and certainly defies definition from the film itself. Meta-human witches and otherworldly entities just don't fit into the universe of Batman; if there was anything even remotely realistic about a caped crimefighter and his maniacal archenemy, this take on the Dark Knight turns everything into over-the-top superpowers duking it out with supernatural gods. The threat of death and the struggle to accomplish a mission hold no weight when magic can be used to do anything - and when characters can die and reappear without any explanations.It's baffling that this movie struggled with its storyline to such a distressing degree. It should have been the simple formula of ""Con Air"" or ""The Dirty Dozen"" with Batman's villains. But it wasn't enough just to build an A-Team (or an Expendables battery) of baddies (dubbed Task Force X); the film also had to include a love story with the Joker (Jared Leto), a love story between the Enchantress (Cara Delevingne) and military man Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), a blackmail scheme, a motivational explosive device implanted in the unwilling draftees' necks (stolen from ""Escape from New York""), and a subplot to summon the soul of the Enchantress' dead brother. There are so many unnecessary asides and utterly pointless characters that some are debuted to fulfill a single idea - such as Adam Beach's Slipknot, who doesn't even get to demonstrate his forte, and Karen Fukuhara's Katana, who arrives just as the squad is deployed, dispensing with having to appear previously in a sensible introduction. Plus, it's never explained why the government can't simply recruit dependable meta-humans like Superman; there can't be solely evil superheroes running about.Even though the structuring of the film is obnoxious, the character designs and origins are ridiculous, and the finale is so nonsensical that it proves that everything transpiring beforehand is of zero consequence, Margot Robbie is spot-on as Harley Quinn. It's impossible to imagine a better live-action representation for the role; she looks the part, acts the part, and speaks in one-liners with that catty, cavalier, coquettish demonstration of bipolarity and derangement so authentic to the source material. She's good enough to have received her own movie. Sadly, everything else about ""Suicide Squad"" is so pitiful that her stunning embodiment is likely to be dragged down by the rest of the inferiority.The Massie Twins",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"First they drive you mad, and then they drag you to war","I have been a DC fan since the 90s, read thousands of issues, including every Squid Squad comics EVER. It' s my favorite US team comic of all time and the DCEU now produced the 3rd source accurate, yet critically despised film in a row. John Ostrander, the creator of the Squad (look him up!), ""loved"" this movie, yet it is being ripped apart for every sin under the sun. Including being an insult to the comic I was deathly afraid that the same insanity would tank BvS (read my 9,5/10 review for the UC) but it didn't. I am now happy that the critics hated this movie as I can't see myself liking a DCEU film they would. I am also a big Marvel film + comic fan, but why do they get universal acclaim for producing inferior movies that radically change the source material? NO comment, to the review:The narrative has a 2 act structure. The 1st half is an over the top black comedy with constantly changing ""theme songs"" to give quick characterization in a crowded cast. Guardians of the Galaxy had pop songs too, but so did Watchmen and the Crow. Stop the rip-off comments, and i liked all 3. The editing is universally criticized and was so fast that even i needed 5 minutes to adjust, and then it HIT me. The director tried to drive me mad, to get inside the character's heads, who are mostly mentally unstable convicts. Genius! All but Flag, Katana and Waller (debatable) are villains, yet the film is being ripped apart for having ""bad role"" models and violence. The film logo has bullet holes, and features the Joker! WTF? The films isn't exactly a feelgood movie either, never blindly compare it to Guardians again. Deadpool is the only US comic movie with similar ideas. Than hell on Earth, literally, breaks loose, and the mission starts.The 2nd half is a borderline bleak war movie, with the Squad and a Special Forces unit cleaning streets and rooms for about 1 hour. A few, universally spectacular flashbacks still occur, a few songs, outside of the well done score, still play but things get dark. That drove critics mad. A war movie about unwilling convicts being dark is a plus! A lot of action in an action film is good! A light in the sky, faceless hordes of enemies and an end-of-the-world plot show up. Just as in the hit comics or Raiders of the Lost Ark. Were these by Marvel too? That's the story. Simple and clean, yet twisted as a pretzel, including a few JLA cameos. Now, the very diverse Squad in alphabetical order:Amanda Waller: Davis nails it, and she ends up being the worst human in the movie, outside of the Joker. The body count on her head makes her the deadliest DCEU (anti-)villain to date. Let's see if she can redeem herself later. Captain Boomerang: Courtney again reminds us that he can act, if the script is good. He even comes back like a + 1 for the safety Unicorn. Deadshot: The 70s version is played well by Smith and his well-used daughter has a comic counterpart. You can see how happy The Fresh Prince of Belle Reve is to be in a good movie, for once! El Diablo: Hernandez made a mostly unknown villain a highlight, as such characters are Ayer's forte. The way he was forced to ""power down"" is fascinating and very daring for a (hard) PG-13 movie. Enchantress: Delevingne's ability to go from creepy to deliberately campy inside the same scene is impressive. Certainly the best version of her, critics can suck it. Another great DC big-bad and her romance with Flag had heart, hehe. Who further cares that her ""brother"", who serves as muscle in cool action scenes, is left unexplored. He is an enforcer, based on a 2 issue villain. How can this be a MAIN criticism? Good on WB for daring a witchcraft-based villain, despite knowing that it would get the film banned in China! Harley Quinn: Robbie played the New52 version, who is a child-killer, so let's stop the role model criticism, and her creator liked her. This version also said that another character needed to ""own"" being a child-killer here. The Joker (Azzarello's grounded mobster + Morrison's Thin White Duke), also showed genuine love for ""his creation"", so this movie nailed their dynamic. Especially during her chemical transformation. The movie's best moment and a highlight for the genre. Joker: Leto was the best part of the movie but I am glad that his constant presence was trimmed down by the constantly misreported (surprise?) re-edits. Longer scenes with him would have derailed the picture BEYOND recognition and only 1 whole scene (a short 3rd act gunfight) appears to be left out. He is also the most comic accurate movie version to date and our second perfect interpretation in a row. Katana: Fukuhara did well for a debut perforce and I hope that her backstory will be further explored later. The cracks in the dog on a leach persona were already telling. + 1 for Japanese dialogue with subtitles. Killer Croc: Akinnuoye-Agbaje's inhuman make-up deserves an Oscar, and he is based on the Azzarello version. These movies aren't afraid to dive deep! Rick Flag: Kinnaman played the no-nonsense soldier with conviction well and hints of inner darkness were a pleasant surprise. His repertoires with Deadshot were spot on. A straight man and shooter. Slipknot: Beach did the one thing the character was supposed to do right, 'nuff said.The action-driven black comedy will ultimately please fans of the DCEU and haters will continue to be baffled by their popularity. David Ayer ain't a perfect, yet innovative, director and delivered his best movie, together with End of Watch. He now earned a life-long fan with me. The DCEU's future never looked brighter and don't forget to read this month's Suicide Squad Rebirth. 8,5/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

They pulled it off good, making it more like a comic book without making the fights feel too unreal to be able to get into them. The only real letdown was the Joker.

"Average, wasted opportunities.","Suicide Squad review:I went into this extremely skeptical, but optimistic.Margot Robbie as Harley did not disappoint at all, fantastic acting and script-writing, DC can really go places with this version of Harley Quinn. One thing that bugged me about Harley was the way she dressed, not a major thing, but did annoy me slightly.Will smith's acting was on point as usual, and really fit into this role. Deadshot is another fantastic character and I hope to see more of him in future endeavors by DC.Killer Croc had potential to be a great main character in Suicide Squad, but due to awful scripting and scenes, Croc was wasted.Jared Leto's acting was amazing from what I saw, but I couldn't help but feel slightly disappointed with the amount of stuff that had to be cut, but I live in hope that the deleted scenes will make it onto the home-video release.Cara Delevingne was great, probably the best acting I've personally seen from her. The Enchantress is a great character and Cara played her heart out and brought her to life.The overall storytelling and plot line of Suicide Squad was good, but left a lot to be desired, very fast moving in terms of story, which cut back on the backgrounds of the characters, but the profiles of which were done excellently. The text and graphics that were partnered when introducing the characters was a great touch, really attractively layout and logos for each character. When trying to conserve time in the film, this was definitely the best choice to introduce the characters.Conclusion:Suicide Squad was a good movie, with a lot to niggle at, and plot holes that were left unfilled. The acting was outstanding from Margot Robbie, Jared Leto, Will Smith and Jai Courtney. I was impressed with the choice of songs that were used in the soundtrack, some great older tunes that really fit the feel of the movie. The overall feel of the film wasn't as colonel or edgy as it seemed, but the gritty, dark nature of DC films lately fit the Suicide Squad just right.

Suicide at the Box Office,"I like all kinds of movies, cheesy B films to Oscar winning. OK, very few romantic comedies, I usually don't like those. I liked Man of Steel and Batman V Superman. I go into a film with the mindset of how a film is marketed, as to how much of my brain to turn off to enjoy it. Now you know what level I'm on, I didn't like Suicide Squad.With a very thin plot and even thinner characters, this movie does not live up to the hype. Will Smith brought his game but could not save the lackluster, boring film. Leto brought nothing entertaining to the Joker. Harley was the comic relief, even though what she said may have been funny in the right context, the lines were delivered at inappropriate times.The pacing was awful, the characters were uninspiring, the villains were boring, the dialogue was boring, the whole movie was just pretty much a disaster. The people who put the trailers together know how to entertain. Unfortunately, the X minutes of trailers we got before the release were all the good parts taken from the movie. When those parts were put back in, they lost their luster.Watch Deadpool or Guardians of the Galaxy again if you want to be entertained, this DC outing has nothing to offer. Both my wife and I did not enjoy this film. We dressed as Harley and the Joker for Halloween a couple of years ago, we won't be repeating that ensemble. On the flip side, our 12 year old son thought it was amazing. He also thinks $5 Hot and Ready pizza and Pokemon tournaments are amazing.Watching Suicide Squad, I felt I was watching a generic, straight to DVD, rip-off of some recent Marvel scenes mixed with the original Ghostbusters. This is hard pressed to even be suggested as a rental. Hopefully WB will slow down and start doing things right.

I enjoyed Leto's Joker, I think it gives the iconic villain a new face whilst maintaining some important things that make the joker who he really is. However he isn't in this movie as much as all of us expected. If you've seen the trailers you've seen about 70% of his scenes.The movie struggled with its story slightly.

The cast was well-balanced. Leto really played the Joker well considering the amount of screen time he had. He isn't on par with Heath but it was still a terrific performance. Margot's performance was definitely something. She really portrayed Harley Quinn well. Which was definitely surprising. Will on the other was just average. His character Deadshot was definitely an interesting character nevertheless. The lines the characters say are really dull and predictable. There were a few funny one liners but other than that, nothing much really. The critics are really harsh on this film and I can't blame them. I really expected so much more of this film.

A step in the right direction,"This movie is definitely not like Batman v. Superman, unlike what a lot of other reviews say. In fact, this movie is pretty much exactly what I thought it would be: Fun!The three characters that were the driving force behind this movie are: Harley Quinn (no surprise there), Deadshot, and surprisingly El Diablo. From the get go it was a given that Harley Quinn was going to be a major factor for this movie doing well. Because she has such a following with fans, her big screen debut is a major deciding factor in which way this movie could turn; either horribly bad, or amazingly awesome. Thankfully, the latter is how it turned out. Margot Robbie was so perfect in the roll it's almost scary. The main thing the three characters have in common is the emotional back story they bring: Harley Quinn and her extreme love and devotion to Mr. J; Deadshot's love for his daughter; and the tragic story behind El Diablo's family. You connect with them, and even though they're bad guys you actually want them to win in a way.Characters like Slipknot (very short screen time), Captain Boomerang, and Killer Croc, didn't really add much. I'm glad they were there because it added just a tiny more depth to the whole ""team"" thing, but if they were gone they wouldn't be missed.I love Jared Leto, but I have to say I am not a fan of his Joker. Sure he looked cool, but he just didn't feel like a good Joker to me. The Joker is supposed to be a fun villain that you enjoy watching on screen because you don't know what he's going to do. I did not feel that way about Leto's version. The fact that he didn't have a lot of screen time was a good thing.The small cameos made by certain Justice League members were done beautifully.Overall I really did enjoy this movie, and I think this is definitely a great step in bringing this universe together.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Personal review from someone that loves this kind of movies,"I enjoy this movie as a big fan movies based on comics however you know that feeling that something was missing? So let's start with the good stuff: - Actors and performance - 10 and above; - Story - pretty awesome, 10 and above; - Costumes - pretty cool, 10 and above; - Timing - here where it got my points down. I felt like whenever there was a great scene, the one that you are supposed to laugh or pay close attention it was rushed. If they left a couple of seconds longer it would make a huge difference. - Humor - Again points down with the timing and I felt like it was supposed to be funny but it lacked audience connection to it. - Production in terms of props - pretty awesome, 10 and above; - Production in terms of camera shooting got points down because in some scenes they could have used the camera in other angles or shoot differently to make bigger and better impact. A few scenes to me were a little forced.The movie trailer sold be a pretty awesome movie and I was left with a great expectation but I left the movie thinking that I knew everything about it in the trailer and not from watching the full movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
VERY Entertaining,"Let me get started by saying that movies are for entertainment. They're are meant to create emotion and usually to teach some kind of lesson. This is the main reason I don't get the bad reviews. Don't get me wrong there are some bad movies out there, but in this case this is not one of them. To start, we can all say Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was Fantastic. Will Smith was also great as Deadshot although some people think he can only play that kind of character. And Jared Leto as The Joker was very good but had very little screen time. The movie itself was full of action, fun, and had some comedy. Although the plot was messy, the entire movie was just awesome. I give it 10/10 for characters, 10/10 for action and enjoyment and 7/10 for the entire story. So overall I give it 9/10 because of all the fun and excitement. Remember this is just my opinion so go see it for yourself.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Pale imitation of Guardians of the Galaxy!,"So lets go through the main factors of this film one at a time. We'll start with the cast. They were brilliant. The saving grace of this film. The main reason I'm not giving it lower than a 5. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is exceptional. And I greatly look forward to seeing her in action in the future. Will Smith plays Deadshot well (despite the fact that the writers clearly don't know who Deadshot is). Jared Leto plays a great (if unfortunately useless) Joker. So the film was cast perfectly. Unfortunately not every character gets an appropriate amount of screen time. The majority of this film is dull, sappy scenes with Deadshot and Harley Quinn which pry deeper into the emotions of their characters than it should. I'm all for breaking into new areas of classic characters. But not in a way that detracts from the enjoyment of these characters. Deadshot is never fun in this film. He's supposed to be a heartless, psychopath who will kill anyone for money. Yet in this film he's a sweet, caring, goody. That's the main problem I have with this film. What they've done to the characters. They've taken some of the greatest, evilest DC characters and turned them into heroes. Now I understand that's the premise of the film, 'the badguys save the day'. And I like that idea. But they need to be badguys. And for the most part they're not. Talk about underwhelming characters. Say hello to the Joker. My favourite villain of all time. Who does LITERALLY nothing in this film. He's absolutely useless. If he wasn't in this film it would play out exactly the same way. He's only here to con people into buying a ticket. I think the director (David Ayer) was trying to channel Guardians of the Galaxy, but for DC, and unfortunately failed. Its nowhere near as funny, has boring action scenes. And where GOTG actually had heart, this film tries to hard to do the same. Which doesn't work with these characters! I've written quite a bit and its time I went to sleep, I was going to talk about the plot but since its so stupid, and uninspired I'd better not. I'm still trying to figure out these characters intentions. Please try and look past beyond the acting, and the explosions when you see this movie. Think about it.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A great addition into a still growing cinematic universe,"Saw this film last night in IMAX 3D with my mom. We both enjoyed very much, the fact that before the movie started my mom asked ""so is this marvel or something?"" and by the end of the movie became familiar with the characters is quite a feat honestly.Pros:Margot Robbie, Viola Davis, Joel Kinnaman and Will Smith absolutely own their roles as Harley Quinn, Amanda Waller, Rick Flagg and Deadshot respectively.The action scenes, while not as many as I might have hoped for, were placed throughout the film in a way that the pacing remained unaffected. Was great to see some of DC's finest villains fight together for the first time on screen.The chemistry among the cast definitely shows and the humor is very effective. The audience at my showing was laughing at nearly every well-placed joke.Cameos from other justice league members are short but effective, they don't overshadow the movie in any shape or form.Cons:Jared Leto as the Joker was barely on screen in order to get an opinion of him. What I did see was promising, but it is a completely different take on the joker that everyone may not be on board with.Enchantress, El Diablo, and Killer Croc have OK story arcs throughout this movie, but nothing that wows, unlike their aforementioned other team members. Katana speaks Japanese and has cool sword fight scenes, but also doesn't have much to do on screen.Do I really need to mention slipknot as a character? Not even a spoiler it's just like common knowledge at this point.Overall, My mom and I enjoyed the film for what it was, a comic book popcorn action film, is it as good as say civil war or Deadpool? No. But it knows what it is and you'll have a kick-ass time at the theater watching it.Oh. And be sure to stay for the mid-credit scene, sets up the rest of the DCEU in a neat way.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Watch it for Margot Robbie,"I admit, I didn't know much about the Suicide Squad characters and who is in the 'bad guys' team and neither did I try to read up too much about them.Maybe that is why I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.Ya it had its weaknesses. It had big plot holes (like why would a super- witch fight in a hand-to-hand combat when she could take away all the weapons?) and lies as marketing (where was Jared Leto as the next-crazy- method-acting-maniacal Joker other than those few minutes on the screen?), but if you leave all that aside, it was a fun watch.Lets look at the bad first. We didn't get to know the back stories of the characters except Dead Shot, played by Will Smith; who is a hit-man but a devoted father and Harley Quinn, played brilliantly by Margot Robbie, the psychiatrist who falls in love with the Joker and he makes her into a over-the-top-sexual deranged, crazy person. I still don't know about the characters which is a pity. And that is one of the big problems isn't it?Why would they fight as a squad when there is nothing in common for them to fight for?- they were let free after Rick Flag destroys the instrument that could be used to blow the bomb-chips inside their bodies. Why would Diablo, played well by Jay Hernandez who is guilty as hell of killing his own family join forces with a bunch of crazies? Who is Killer-Croc, what is his story? Why does Boomerang keep a stuffed- horse with him? So the whole movie was not driven by characters – which was what it was supposed to be.The climax reminded me of Ghostbusters – the Sigourney Weaver one where she gets possessed and tries to bring hell on earth – which doesn't say much. The climax should have been more, I wanted more.But in spite of many loopholes, me as an average movie goer will love this movie, especially if I don't know much about the actual Suicide Squad. I was entertained, pretty much through the movie (compared to the recent ones I saw like Independence Day and Jason Bourne) – it was paced okay, there were some light moments and I loved Margot Robbie – she was made into this sexual-bimbo, but which heroine today isn't? At least she owned the craziness that the character is supposed to own. It was her movie along with Will Smith's who showed the swagger that he owns.Come on people, don't overthink this one when you are watching it and you will have fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Despite some plot holes and a somewhat generic villain, Suicide Squad is overall a pretty enjoyable film.","Suicide Squad is the third film in the DC Cinematic Universe. Even though I still had doubts as to whether it would be any good, considering the lukewarm feelings I have for Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, this film is a big improvement. So far, I consider it the best of the three films in DC's Extended Universe.Months after the events of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, government official Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) assembles a team of apprehended supervillains to undertake dangerous missions in exchange for lighter prison sentences and clemency. These supervillains include expert marksman Deadshot (Will Smith), former psychiatrist Harley Quinn (Margot Elise Robbie), fire manipulator El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Australian assassin Boomerang (Jai Courtney), and the reptilian Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye- Agbaje).While the film suffers from a poorly edited and choppy first act, as was also the case with Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Suicide Squad has such a fun, manic vibe to it that it is hard for me to dislike. I feel that the best scenes involved Deadshot's backstory and Harley Quinn's fall from grace as a respected criminal psychiatrist. However, it is Jared Leto's portrayal of The Joker that was the biggest surprise for me. His chilling take on the role fits the film's aesthetic perfectly. The soundtrack was great too, which included music from Queen and The White Stripes. Despite some plot holes and a somewhat generic villain, Suicide Squad is overall a pretty enjoyable film.I rate it 7/10.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"The movie has a good soundtrack, though.....","This movie had one of the best marketing campaigns for any movie ever.Somehow this movie feels like a piece of engineering rather than actual entertainment. In a way it is as if there were a masterpiece version of Suicide Squad out there somewhere and then people less talented but with great workmen skills in film-making were told to do a replica and it turned out fine but just not the real thing. Anyhow, it's not a bad movie and I had this super cool lengthy review about it but then I heard these lines in one of the songs on the soundtrack and I thought: At least they're honest to their DC fans so I'll stick with that:Used to doing bad, now we feel like we just now getting it * Ain't got no other way so we started and finished it * No pain, no gain * Never stand down, made our own way * Never going slow, we pick up the pace * This is what we wanted from a young age * No emotion, that's what business is * Lord have mercy on the witnessesI torture you * Take my hand through the flames * I torture you * I'm a slave to your games * I'm just a sucker for pain",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Good but not a perfect movie,"I saw this movie on its premier, and there is no review so far that really seems to have the 100% same opinion as me so I'm making my own review. Every suicide squad member is likable in this film. That is something David Ayer did perfectly. But lets start with the issues of this movie. For a movie to be really really good you need an antagonist to be just as good as the hero (heros) and this movie completely failed the villain, I'm gonna say who the villain is because i came into the movie and knew who the villain was gonna be and i thought i ruined some of the movie by knowing it before i saw the movie. The villain of this movie is Enchantress. They did give us one reason to understand why this character did what she did and why we even should like her personality. So the 3th act of this film is really really bad, because of the villain and the effects. The effects was not great at all, it was almost like watching a game.The 1st and 2st act of this movie, was excellent if you ask me. The action was good the characters back story was great, the humor was good and it seemed like every member had a motivation to join this suicide squad even tho they didn't say it out loud (which is something good) Because i at least like to see things for my self instead of a character in the movie telling it to me. And when it comes to the Joker which is a character you guys are excited to see, at least i was. For me it seems like Jared Leto is the perfect actor for this role. You have no idea what this guy is gonna do next and i like that, it builds excitement. I also think he looks great as the joker. Im not going to mention every character, but a lot of reviews are saying Deadshoot and Harley quin ¨steals¨ the movie, i don't agree to that. Yes those two are given the most backstory, but i still liked every other character as well. They made Captain f**** boomerang seem like a cool guy that says something. But i have to say this thing tho, when Deadshoot jumps up on the car and starting shooting people (as you see in the trailer) this is the moment when you understand how good this Deadshoot guy is on what he is doing, you get so pulled into this scene. So anyway the 1st and 2st is great, really good actors and characters, the 3st act is really bad, you don't feel anything for the villain and you barley understand why she does what she does, as well as the cgi is bad. I will give this movie a 7/10 if this movie didn't have such a bad ending i would prob given it a 8,5/10. There is one thing I'm sort of mad about, and that is that David Ayer only had 6weeks on writing the script for this movie, i think they should have given him more time and not rushed the project so much. Sorry for all the words written wrong, i'm not from America or England so this is not my main language. Anyway let me hear your thoughts.﻿",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A decent action film with never before seen DC characters.,"As always, RT nonsense score and reviews aside, I went in with no expectations. I love my comic books (DC & Marvel) both. Both publishing houses have created some of the best fictional characters out there.Suicide Squad has always been a side project of sorts including in the comic books. The movie for me was taken as such.That is exactly what I got. A 7/10 comic book action flick which had some great action sequences with Deadshot. Harley and Joker didn't do much for me and neither did the rest of the 'squad'.We are lucky to be living in such wonderful times where comic book film adaptations are a plenty. In my days, we were lucky to get one film in years.Nonetheless, I enjoyed the film. I would say do not believe RT, IMDb ratings or Marvel fanboys. Go in with an open mind and enjoy a decent action film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
chaotic fun,"I have gotten into the habit lately (maybe rightly or not) of walking into movies with pretty low expectations (see Tarzan review) however both times this has happened I have had a great viewing experience.I get the feeling,although not easily swayed that the negativity that many big releases are getting these days pre release is so overwhelming that it becomes hard to focus solely on the movie itself.Bottom line is that the haters may have written off Suicide Squad already and on some points maybe they are right to but having seen it 2D without gimmicks and so on it is well directed and pretty well acted for the most part.The characters are darkly fun and I love the villain twist.I never got bored and loved the Joker (hope he returns) and for 2 hours or so had a really great time watching a popcorn flick which entertains.IMO it delivers the blockbuster side of the deal,but on the flip side the negatives are,sloppily set up,no real tension on building the team,first 45 minutes pretty crude and messy with no real narrative which has any cohesion and ""emotional"" scenes when they occur feel slightly shoe-horned in and not massively convincing.Best performances.Margot Robbie,Jared Leto,Viola Davis as Amanda Waller and Jai Courtney who knows about handling a boomerang.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Amusing but Thin in Character Developments,"The arrival of these bad-asses have boosted a transformation effort of DC universe in term of a bit lighter tone at the very beginning but the entire film still leaves an impression of being darker compared to other Marvels production, which is a bit let down from what it is marketed. Trying to expand just like Guardians of the Galaxy, uneven plot and character development are the main issues of Ayer's screenplay. The movie sets up after the death of Superman and rushes towards the event hosted by the main antagonist, affecting the overall fluidity of the story. Assuming that audiences are already familiar with the comics, all the characters are briefly introduced and it works less effectively especially when the Squad itself is not well known like Batman or Superman. Will Smith and Margot Robbie perform decently as Deadshot and Quinn, emotional engagement does exist among all but lack in depth for featuring too many characters at one shot especially Joker. Despite these main problems, action sequences are packed enough and fun to follow while the visual effects are more colorful compared to the other DC films; Retaining the rhythm of Zimmer's BvS theme, Steven Price has composed the scores in a different tunes, combining some rock musics that suit well the film and a sense of DC universe's continuity. While it misfires at plot and those super villains are not shown to be doing anything too evil, it does not aim to be like other superheroes films, it is still amusing and it gives a new life to DC's big-screen universe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
DC fanboys gotta stop giving it 10/10.,"Got to balance out these 10/10s. Everybody knows that this movie was nowhere near a perfect 10. There isn't even a Marvel movie that's a ten. DC crams too many characters into their movies. Harley, Deadshot, Rick Flag, Enchantress, and Amanda Waller were the only ones who actually did something in the movie. Harley, Deadshot, and Waller were the only ""good"" characters. The rest of the Squad was just there to be there. Joker was shoehorned in. Flag's romance with June Moone was pointless. Slipknot did so little I almost forgot he was in the movie. Same for Captain Boomerang. Katana and Killer Croc are just there to kill the zombies or whatever they were. The plot twists weren't good or surprising. I thought this movie was going to be fun to watch but DC ruins it again.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Entertaining comic book action film, well worth watching!","Going into this film I was already aware of the Suicide Squad. I've had brief glimpses of some of the old and the new squads, and have also seen the animated version (which is definitely worth checking out by the way).So, onto the film. I felt that the pacing was good, as at no point during the film did I feel bored. The story, such as it was, progressed at a good pace and never really gave me a chance to stop and think, which may have been a good thing as it was not overly deep or original. However, this is a comic book film, so I wasn't exactly expecting a highbrow masterpiece in terms of story, but the action scenes were enjoyable and kept the film moving along.The characters were introduced through exposition, which would normally be written off as lazy, but was appropriate in this film in the context it was used. I'm not going to talk about the individual changes to characters compared to the comics as there are always going to be differences; I'll leave that to the fans to bicker about.In my opinion, you were given enough information about each character to get a sense of their motivations and capabilities (very similar amounts to characters in films like The Magnificent Seven and The Dirty Dozen, and you never hear complaints about them). Some people may complain about the number of characters, but those same people won't question the amount in Game of ThronesThe two main characters, Harley Quinn and Deadshot, were both portrayed well by Margot Robbie and Will Smith respectively. You'll probably hear a lot about how little of Jared Leto's Joker was in the film, which people are chalking up as a negative, however, I'd be disinclined to agree. The Joker should never be a main character in a film where Batman is not also the main character, and in this film, Ben Affleck's Batman was hardly present (again, not a negative thing).This film is about Amanda Waller's Task Force X (the Suicide Squad), who was played very well by Viola Davis (Waller is definitely not someone to be messed with), and this film establishes them as 'The Other Guys'; the ones you call when the Justice League are too busy, and the ones that the government has near total control over.If you enjoy films like The Magnificent Seven or The Dirty Dozen, and also happen to like comic book films, then I really think you'll enjoy this. People are far too quick to compare this to Marvel's misfit offering, Guardians of the Galaxy (which is an excellent film by the way, you should watch it!), when better comparisons are to the two films I just mentioned. Don't get sucked into the Marvel vs DC debate; it's OK to like both!(Review from my blog: whingewood.wordpress.com)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Colourful, trashy fun","Suicide Squad is visually stunning with some great performances. Will Smith and Margot Robbie are fantastic as Deadshot and Harley Quinn and are the two characters that are paid the most attention, and whose backstories we see the most of. However, that doesn't mean the rest of the cast aren't as interesting and fun to watch. Jai Courtney did a nice job as Captain Boomerang and was actually pretty entertaining. Cara Delevigne is good as Enchantress, though she wasn't a stand-out like Robbie, and Jay Hernandez did a great job as El Diablo; he brought an unexpected heart to the team. Jared Leto's Joker was a wild card, and not as prominent as fans were expecting. However, his joker was a lot of fun. He admirably portrayed the Joker's complete psychosis and brought a colourful Mob Boss aesthetic, in contrast to Ledger and Nicholson's portrayals. Some people won't be a fan of Leto's Joker, but I found him engaging and want to see more of him.The film is very action heavy which, while entertaining and beautifully shot, was to the detriment of the plot and pacing of the rest of the movie. Background information had to be revealed to the audience through characters telling other characters, rather than have it play out visually and naturally, and there were flash-backs spread liberally throughout the film because there wasn't enough time evolve the events linearly. The flashbacks weren't uninteresting to watch, but there were so many of them that they did make the film feel disjointed and a little patch-work.Overall, I give Suicide Squad 7/10. It's a wonderfully shot movie; great action, entertaining, with witty and engaging characters.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Margot Robbie is So AWESOME!!!,"Suicide Squad was so fun to watch. I especially liked Margot Robbie as a Harley Quinn. She did an amazing job. She steals the show.

Especially Will Smith as Deadshot, he really surprised me. Jared Leto as the Joker is not in it as much as I wanted him too but that's fine.

Suicide Squad Goals Reached!!,"Well for starter this is my first review. I will keep it short but still as good as i can.For starter (technical): The movie has his good and bad moment. Its true the pacing in the first part is bam bam bam bam, and the second is more good. But to give credit its a movie about bad guys and nutheads so the pacing kinda clicks with that. THere are some very beautiful technical shots.The actors all did a good job, yes you can see the cast just loved to make this movie in particular Margot Robbie, its like she just had the time of her life. Will Smith is a good cast for deadshot has his hard (badass) edge and his soft core. THen you have Jared Leto. Well to say he nailed it right on the head. He's creepy and mentally in a good state of mind to play this character. He makes me think about the animated series. Compared to Heath (wich doesn't really make a case) in my opinion they are equal but different. I think Leto struck gold and in my opinion needs more screen time in Batman flicks or maybe a Solo movie (killing joke esq) Diablo and boomerang just nailed everything on there part.FOr the Plot and villain. There are some holes in the story where i didn't really know why it happened. That asside it clings together.TO conclude: The critics made some arguments that aren't to be discussed with. But To say its a bad movie and another fail for DCEU -> ITS not i think this is a very good step forward for the whole DCEU.Comparrason with BvS: Its lighter, funnier but in a way still dark and thats what makes DCEU apart from Marvel.

A decent movie,The hype behind this film was incredible and especially after the not so hot Batman vs Superman Dawn of Justice movie that was previously launched by DC Comics.People were hoping that this would be the movie to jump start new life into the DC Comics movie universe and maybe start to become more competitive with the Marvel Comics hugely successful movie franchise and unfortunately this movie didn't make the cut.This movie had a lot to live up to but undoubtedly could not live up to the expectations of the public.Saying that however this movie isn't a complete waste of time. I don't regret watching it but i do however have to say that Dc Comics have a lot to catch up on.Batman is featured in this film and I do feel that Ben Affleck is growing on me as batman.Ben Affleck should however be given his own stand alone Batman movie so that the public is able to better grasp the type of Batman he is trying to portray.Suicide Squad gives us the back stories of the characters in this film with some characters getting a bigger back story than others.The Joker in this film didn't work really well as they tried to make him too cliché.The story line in this movie was confusing and jumped around too much. There was no real direction and the movie was more focused on Deadshot and Harley Quinn. The characters in this movie also struggled with their identity and when the movie was coming to a close the end scene didn't really need to happen.It was good that they still let the audience know that The Joker is alive but they could have done that in another way that could have lead to a much more interesting sequel.The film was of a low standard with maybe a fresh group of writers and a new director helping the film reach that new level.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Well done but premature,"As a long-time fan of DC, I thoroughly enjoyed this. However, for as well as they represented the characters, there were still many missed opportunities, most notably placing this film ahead of the necessary live-action films that should predate it, allowing the average fan to learn the characters. I held Assault On Arkham in high esteem, notably for providing closure to character arcs left hanging in the animated series. If you see this movie as a bonus to that, it's enjoyable but a bit disjointed.Deadshot: Will Smith does a really good job, but he needs at least one prequel movie to help negate his Boy Scout reputation as an actor. This follows with my theme of Suicide Squad providing closure to bad guy character arcs.Joker: Jared Leto has a solid handle on the character. Would really love seeing him written appropriately (i.e. The Dark Knight) rather than just a random plot device when the Suicide Squad needs some chaos to deal with.Harley: Well acted but overplayed. After a while it seemed like if they needed some filler, they'd just choose Margot Robbie rather than try to flesh out another character better. Good for her, but bad for the film.Plot: Overplaying the Enchantress was pretty lame. No real character development or agenda, just a contrived force for the sake of developing the Suicide Squad. We could've used the Justice League, or Lex Luthor, or a host of other interesting options, but instead we got the DC equivalent of Apocalypse from another failed movie.Bottom line: we shouldn't have seen this movie for a long time.

How?,"Suicide Squad is an awful film, with some of the biggest wastes of potential ever, this team is awful and this movie is awful, all the heroes looked terrible and Killer Croc looked atrocious, Jared Leto's acting was on par with Amber Beard's in Aquaman and this film has 0 plot, but the interesting thing is I actually used to love it, Will Smith and Margot Robbie are great in their respective roles but that's the only good part.D-",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Harley steals it, Smith nails it. Leto becomes the Joker.","I stuck this flick up in my Plex Server and forgot about it. Then I watched it a few more times, and something happened. It grew on me.Most of the reviews I have read are over-analyzing this film. It is what it is. It's the BAD GUYS. It's The Joker. It's a comic book movie, for cryin out loud! Sorry, movies that ""suck"" do not rake in a $745,600,054 Box Office. So, IMDb reviews say that this film sucks, and the Box Office (and other review sites) say that it doesn't. So ya just have to decide what you are gonna believe. If people kept going to the theatre to see it, and if they keep buying the Blu Ray or renting it, even to this day, then I'd say it less than sucks. Because it's just a fun movie.The More I watch this, the more I think Jared Leto is the best Joker I've ever seen. We have all this dark Magic cack going on in the background, the Sorceress is making an army out of charcoal people. But what's The Joker doing? He's gettin' ""His Puddin"" back. All of the members of Suicide Squad have thing's they'd rather be doing, but The Joker? He just wants His Puddin'. He'll do anything for her.I love this film for the backstory of Harley Quinn and The Joker, it explains a lot about the character. My first introduction to Harley was in the animated Batman from the early 90's. Margot Robie gets it, she's that exact Harley,The strongest points are Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Will Smith doing a great Deadshot. There are some truly great moments in this, but it takes a while to get to them.People have said that the Extended cut ruins the film. No, Nope. Especially the Harley/Motorcycle scene. I'm not really sure how the Theatrical version goes, I saw the extended version first.As I said, the first time I ever saw the Harley character was in the late 80's/Early 90's Batman cartoons. This character is pretty close to how that Harley was. That early Harley seemed to be a person who when trying to do the right thing, always gets quashed by prejudgments and circumstances and ends up back in Arkham. The relationship with The Joker has morphed into a full on love story, and it works here.Mostly, this film is a about the Harley/Joker (Jared Leto) connection, this Joker has moved away from the comical Cesar Romero version and the typical real-bad-guy as portrayed by Jack Nicholson and the late Heath Ledger, to a more complicated personality: You never know what side of the law he'll assist. Most of his motivation is for Harley, so whatever is good for her, he does. Sometimes that happens to help out the good guys (whoever they are), sometimes not. That's the other issue: This film is all shades of Grey, the worst people are shown to have some measure of compassion, and the alleged ""good people"" will break the law to keep secrets.By contrast, the Deadshot story is also a love story, his concern is for his daughter. Which is how government agent ""Amanda Waller"" (Viola Davis) manipulates him - And she uses the same tactic on the rest of the Metahumans she's gathered up. But Amanda has bitten off a little too much with her incarceration of ""The Enchantress""/June Moone (Cara Delevingne) who gets away and starts a supernatural ruckus.So Waller sends out the rest of these (alleged) crazies under Colonel Rick Flag (and I am a huge fan of Joel Kinnaman) who is compromised by being in love with The Enchantress' Host June Moone- to hunt *down* The Enchantress. Seems a futile situation. One thing is clear, Waller is worse than the actual crooks in this sortie. Killer Kroc (And I had not recognised Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney- Almost didn't recognize him too), Slipknot, Diablo, and maybe a few others - It gets confusing as the film goes along, with all of these characters. But eventually it falls on ""Task Force X"" aka Suicide Squad to take down Enchantress and each member has a role they play in this. Despite the story clutter, it's good to see these crooks all gathered up in one place. Director and Writer David Ayer tries hard to be Zack Snyder, maybe is able to emulate some of the imagery Snyder has created. Look for Clint Eastwood progeny Scott as a nasty Prison guard, and somewhere is voice and character actor Robin Atkin Downes (""Byron"" from Babylon 5) as someone named ""Angelo"".The more I watch this, the more I find some great Classic Joker moments. Leto plays this as a cross between the Caesar Romero Joker, the Nicholson Joker, and the Heath Ledger Joker (who I liked the least). I think this Joker is the most like the Joker from the Comics. All I know is that, when Suicide Squad 2 comes out, I'll be in line. and so will a lot of other people.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This time the villains become heroes,I am normally not a big fan of super heroes. It's always the same and it gets boring after a while. This time you get the villains to be the heroes by saving the earth from another villain. It's a bit different but still you get the feeling that you saw it all before. The action is good though. And that is the only thing that counts in movies like that. To me the best villain to look at was Harley Quinn played by Margot Robbie. She has a touch of humor that does the story good. Otherwise don't expect too much of the movie or the story. Like I said it's all been done before. But for an evening of just relaxing watching some action scenes it's an okay movie. There are way worse movies then this one.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Suicide Squad (2016) The worst movie in the DCEU,"When the Suicide Squad trailer was released everyone was excited thinking it was going to be an amazing movie, but of course they were all wrong. It's almost impossible to find positive points in this movie, maybe Harley Quinn is an interesting character, in some moments Deadshot is also cool, but overall he sucks. Enemies throughout the entire movie are very silly and the fight scenes with them are awful. They fail to develop the characters and get the audience to buy into the idea that they have become a family. Everything is so forced, everything is awful. This movie is the worst of this DC shared universe.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Entertaining, but poor in usual fundamentals","First off, this movie doesn't shine at all in terms of physical aspects, or even other elements that usually constitutes a movie that gets high ratings all around. There isn't much to say about the cinematography, the editing is distracting at times, the plot is second-rate, and more could have been done about the setting. In essence, the movie can objectively be considered as 'shoddy'. But what saves it is its high entertainment value.When it starts, everything goes well. The exposition sets up an anticipation that the next hour and forty minutes are going to be a blast. However, the first act ends and the zany plot begins almost instantly when the conflict and villain are simultaneously revealed. From then on, I still continued to thoroughly enjoy the movie, despite it abounding with flaws and all.The thing is that, to like the movie, you have to accept the silly premise and realize that it's purpose wasn't to become a celebrated film, or even a great blockbuster of the year. It's about a team of assembled ""supervillains"" taking on a crazy supernatural entity laying waste to the city. The story and pacing make for a refreshingly simple action picture from what we've come to normally expect from most recent movies - including comic book ones - that must always be fixed with some contrived narrative. So you have to sort of dim your brain, in a way. If you look at the movie subjectively, it could be looked at as being ""good"" akin to certain movies like the 2012 ""Dredd"" or something (except maybe with worse direction).Now even with that, other problems still affected the final outcome of ""Suicide Squad"". I felt that the characters needed to be more fleshed out and given depth, rather than having a cast of personalities we don't even know working together. Some characters with the highest potential like Joker, left us ambivalent about him due to his minimal screen time. The build up of the movie could also have used work, as it felt that the climax already started near the beginning without getting our feet wet first with the ensemble of bad guys.It's quite hard to justify why this movie gets a ""6"" with all these faults, but it mostly comes down to this: you can choose to enjoy it or not, and when you do, it definitely has a certain charm.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
No a disaster but neither a film worth remember,"OK let explain what we are missing from this film, Common sense and fast phases. I understand that they want the movie to have action and more action but it was missing the element of introduce the squad. They did very well with Will smith and Margot , but the rest of them team I can't barely even remember them. But what about the Joker, I was so excited to see the Joker fell in love with Harley that I was well I have a new ship,no happening. I was so disappointed that I couldn't enjoy the turbulent love physiology between this two character. I m definitely down to watch a Harley Quinn solo movie, she make me believe that she was the right cast for that character in specific. The films was not only fast phase , it did no make sense in some points. One minute you were watching this and in the other they jump to another locations. Amanda Waller another disappointment, I was like yeah this woman is going to fight and make the enchanted life miserable, No Happening neither.I don't really see the reason of the Flash and Batman to be in this movie even though both of the appearance where short I was like OK. Once again the Joker Jared is no bad but we have a expectation from the Joker that it would never be satisfy. After heath ledger , we have picture the Joker with his face and personality , unfortunately he is no any longer with us to portrait this character so, and I am not a fan of Jared Leto but please stop comparing leto work with Ledger. They would nerve ever been another joker like the one that Christopher Nola delivery us in Batman dark knight. With that been said I give a 6 to this move for the actors portrait , they were good but scrip was trash.

Movie wasn't perfect but definitely entertaining!,"I had no clue what to expect from this movie. some previews looked awesome and others just okay. But I went and really was blown away! It brought me back to the feeling i had while watching the Dark Night Trilogy, not perfect in every way, but still really entertaining! I loved this movie! Sure some of the lines fell flat and they cut so many scenes that certain things felt unfinished but it was still great. Jared Leto as the Joker was by far my favorite! There were times when i watched him that i would literally look at my friend with a disturbed expression because he just seemed genuinely psychotic. Ledger's interpretation was great and very witty but i personally felt that Leto captured the craziness better but in a whole new way. and with that said Joker and Harley Quinn were the best. They were fun to look at and they left me wanting so much more!! this movie was definitely a new interpretation, music choices were good but a little cheesy lol, and they left out way too much that could've tied up some loose ends but all in all i was really impressed by all of the performances!! I would definitely recommend seeing this film but just go into it open minded instead of critical.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Still succeeds despite that one, huge shortcoming","And by one, huge shortcoming I mean that PG-13 rating.Wow, if ever a rating killed the potential a film had it would be this one. What an R rating could have done for this film, well... We'll all have to imagine it somewhere in the back burner of our fan-tasies.Despite that oh so obvious attempt to make the PG-13 rating work, it still has merit in being just a fun, hot mess of a film.The film gets things rolling very well right from the start. It's not a slow build up. Nice to finally see the scenes from the trailer in the correct order (probably not in the order you thought).Introduced are Deadshot, Harley Quinn, Boomerang, Diablo, Killer Croc, Enchantress and a host of other characters. For a cast this size, I'm impressed that the film neatly managed to squeeze screen time for every character without throwing any under the bus. What's more it managed to make us feel for the characters. That would also be a challenge for a cast this big, to zero in on and focus on their deeper personas, but the film manages to do so effectively particularly with Harley Quinn and Deadshot, who by the way, are the film's best characters. Margot Robbie deserves a few award nods for her take on Harley Quinn.As the trailers implied, the film gathers them up and spits them out in front of an enemy no one is prepared to deal with. They have just the right amount of devil may care attitude to carry out the job. This is where the film weakens a bit. Yeah, it's a scary foe, but we're left wondering, ""With an enemy that fierce, where's the panic? Where's the wider sense of something going horribly horribly wrong."" We never really get a broader scope of what it implies for the rest of the world. We see it purely from the angle of the insiders.This ""insider view"" is constant and consistent throughout the entire film. Whatever the world is seeing (something we often get in most comic book films) we're not seeing it. Everything is from our anti-heroes' point of view. This is one of the things that separates Suicide Squad from other films. It paints a dark but rosy outlook that we often don't see in most comic book films.In the end this is a very character-driven film. The action sequences work well, funny bits here and there, but if your'e not rooting for these guys by the end, you're obviously not a fan of interesting characters.One thing I'd like to add. Zack Synder's fingerprints are all over this film (making a film into one long music video is basically his signature), but luckily there are very few slow motion scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not with a Bang but a Whimper,"Yup, as atrocious as I remembered--maybe more so. Just wanted to make sure before the arrival of the sequel to ""Suicide Squad,"" the downright impudently-titled ""The Suicide Squad"" (2021). Not that this movie doesn't deserve to have the definite, or definitive rather, article thrown at it disrespectfully. I see the critics are already scoring it well, but it's not as though one didn't already expect it to be better; how could it not be? The only thing going for this first version of a motley crew of supervillains-turned-superhero league is Margot Robbie's (and that of the Oscar-winning Hairstyling and Makeup's) Harley Quinn. Everything else is at best a take-it-or-leave-it proposition for me: Batman cameos, Will Smith doing Will Smith, Oscar-winner Viola Davis getting a paycheck, the Boomerang guy carrying around a stuffed toy unicorn, even the PG-13 ""male gaze"" containing numerous views of Robbie's posterior in underwear that's passed off as shorts and her appearing in a wet t-shirt later. Most of it's worse than that.Bad jokes and clunky dialogue; erroneously edited and poorly paced with too much posturing and standing around; the dull bar scene and mass murderers and sociopaths pissing and moaning about how nobody likes them--I mean, pick a lane: are they anti-heroes or are they misunderstood crybabies; those stupid character introductory graphics containing too much word vomit to read in time or be worthy of pausing to do so during streaming or home video; the most inane Joker yet and too much of him; CGI glop for antagonists and another enemy army of bloodless clones to fight; the pillar-of-light trope marking the center of the apocalypse with an energy beam shooting up into the sky with junk floating around it for the umpteenth time in these stupid, stupid action and comic-book movies; and holy helicopter crashes, Batman, think of something else to film.

Good....... But........... Minor Spoilers,"As a huge DC fan I couldn't wait to see this film, most of it didn't disappoint.If you have read new 52 suicide squad this is so true to the comics you won't be disappointed. Robbie and Smith are fantastic and the plot is fun although it misses most of the laugh out loud moments a MCU film has.Lots of folks are talking about the tonal shift half was through (which is more like 25% of the way in) but that made sense to me. The squad start in prison, have nothing to loose and the film demonstrates that by bring jovial. Later in as they are put on a suicide mission their bad ass nature emerges and proves why these guys are in super max.Then the bad, and I mean horrific......I love the joker, I have him tattooed on my body, I like 30 seconds to Mars Jared Leto's band but the combination of the 2 left a very sour taste.When he first appeared I thought I got where they where going, not wanting to copy Nolans/Ledgers vision of the character they where turning him into a psycho mob boss, the novelty lasted 30 seconds to hell then I wanted to see him gone. This portrayal has no redeeming features, he is naff beyond all belief, just horrid. And this isn't in a Joffrey GoT style it's he's so hammy you want to walk out when he's on screen.This film will be great on blu-ray where the joker parts but all in all very much enjoyed",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Mess of the year -or- Watch ""Assalt on Arkham"" or ""The Dirty Dozen"" for better use of your time","Man.....I was so hyped for this movie, I watched the trailer every week waiting and waiting.And the day arrived. First Half hour it was a good movie with a nice soundtrack, Beginning with Viola Davis introducing each member of the squad. Then the mess start....Will Smith being his charismatic self except charisma does not mean good acting. The actor had the most cringe worth performances and lines of the movie, trying to bring a big name to draw the crowd, with little to none performance to add, in a movie this hyped, is pure stupidity.Margot Robbie, although I still don't think she's that good of an actress, she is surprising the high part of the movie with her antics, comedy and seductive nature.Jared Leto is one of the low points of the movie, completely unnecessary for the movie, BUT all trainer used him as the huge high point every interview was about Leto, every video, photo was about the new Joker who was to top every single one being Nicholson, Ledger or Hamil. Should have cutted all of him and focused more on the plot of the filmCroc and Boomerang got left on the sidetracks while the director( or the studio) forced the movie solely on Smith and Robbie, wasted potential. Katana with almost no screen time does steal the scene mainly because her outfit draws attention, explaining the power of her sword was used a very corny line and that was it, better left unsaid. And the last member of the squad Diablo.....he was to be the highest point of the film, great arc, great background but that ending......destroyed all the good he has done on the filmViola Davis shines as a great Amanda Waller, but her Amanda is a terrible at her job, thanks to a horrible script. won't say more to not spoil things but when acting is concern she was the highest point of the movie.Finally, who smoke the weed that allowed Cara Delevingne be casted as enchantress? Smith in my opinion was bad on it, but she makes him looks like Heath Ledger on the Dark Knight, the excess of CGI didn't help, but it made even worse, First rule of movie making, ALWAYS cast a great actor/actress for the villain. because that's where it's going to be needed, the motivations, the rage everything must be passed to the audience, if doesn't get a good actor/actress for that part most of the times the audience won't connect.There were a lot of technical problems with the editing, and when I read that materials were taken from the joker, katana, boomerang and others off the picture, I have no choice but to believe because of the poor editing that makes scenes don't look connected and brutally cutted, the soundtrack was good, but you can't stop comparing to Guardins of the Galaxy, that was much better in comparison( despite having a poor villain as well), some songs seems to be putted there only because of the trailer, not because it fitted on the mood, I kind of enjoyed but it is important to point that out).And the ending......Ahhhh the ending...... So cliché, so much slow motion, so much cliché, so much slow motion( that was on purpose).....I never watched but every single person that has compared this ending with the final act of Fantisc 4(2015) with better CGI, might be just exaggeration, but that's how they felt on the level of horrible that ending was.I paid the ticket because I am a fan and practically had an orgarms at each trailer they release, if you aren't run away from this. A voted for a 6 because I'm a fan, and because the first half was good, but it wouldn't be overkill to but it as a 5 or 4 because of the way the second and third act went.P.S.: I'm incredible rusted on my English, if you read and saw a mistake fell free to correct me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"There's something you could do for me, doctor.","Even though it was hyped up pretty well, Suicide Squad unfortunately flops around like a fish out of water from start to finish. I came to this film straight from Batman v. Superman - Dawn of Justice, and I loved the dark, gritty energy ever so kindly provided by Zach Snyder, but not even my MCU watching spree could have prepared me for a terrible comic book movie.The problems (definitely plural) don't make themselves known at the start of Suicide Squad, but as you progress through the film you start to see the wallpaper unravel and give way to the moldy concrete beneath. The actual Suicide Squad (from DC) is made up of incredible villains, and David Ayer's screenplay seems to forget that these characters have been developed for decades, their backstories and actions in life fleshed out to the maximum. A few of the characters (Deadshot, Harley, El Diablo) get a snippet of their former lives shown on screen, but the others are ignored (with just a few lines of dialogue to patch together years of character development). This makes it difficult for viewers not familiar with the comic book source material to actually forge connections with most of the characters on screen. With shoddy dialogue plaguing the entire film, filler action sequences with little to energy and a soundtrack built almost completely of licensed music, enjoying the film becomes a possibility only in your imagination.The real issue with Suicide Squad is that it doesn't bring any energy to the big screen. Dawn of Justice, Man of Steel, the Nolan Batman Trilogy - hell, even the animated movies like Batman: The Long Halloween - all radiate purpose and a genuine story. But Ayer's film has the squad go from Point A to Point D, attempting to lure the viewer using forced emotional sequences that have the opposite effect and leave a terrible aftertaste. Add characters not actually dying and magically surviving (what should be) mortal wounds to the mix and you get a film that can't find its place.The feel-good ending, partially complete characters and a narrative that could be easily transformed into one paragraph make Suicide Squad a really difficult film to watch. As a DC fan, I was able to stomach the movie until the post-credits scene - but would never recommend this to anyone.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Definitely better than reviews suggest,"I never saw Man of Steel, but I thought B v S was honestly enjoyable enough to be decent, even if it was messy. However, I really liked Suicide Squad. I thought the main villain/antagonist was absolutely awful. I'm not sure if it was the writing or the actress (both honestly) but she was beyond cheesy and lame. I also liked The Joker as a character, but Leto was just trying too hard. I didn't particularly like his portrayal. I also think the squad members were humanized way too much, but overall I found it to be super enjoyable, not nearly as exploitative, and also a lot less try-hard than expected (and less try-hard than Deadpool, which I don't really like). There were moments when it was a bit disjointed, but most characters worked, some great character moments, the balance in comedy/drama worked well, some very good acting (Mostly Margot Robbie and Viola Davis), and it definitely felt more relaxed and fun than B v S. More than anything, I think it worked so well because it never lost sight of its characters, even amidst all of the action. I think that's why it worked despite the awful main antagonist, because it was so deeply rooted in its characters and they were never ignored. It was just so much fun, mostly coherent, and well-paced.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The characters we all know and love have been twisted to fit in with this new punk-pop style the director seems to be trying to foist on them, the soundtrack being further disconcerting proof of this. The messages of the film have been awfully skewed, particularly concerning the relationship between HQ and the Joker, which actually made me feel extremely uncomfortable, not least because ever since the films release girls have been trying to find a relationship in this vain. The relationship between them is supposed to be construed as damaging, not insanely romantic, and I think the messages this film has sent out to young girls regarding how they should act to be appealing to men and what sort of man they should be looking for are absolutely appalling. I wish I could say that despite this the film was good, but this is not the case. It was plot less, pointless, and utterly disappointing.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"As an avid reader, I loved it","The minute I heard about it's production state I immediately vowed myself to watching it in theaters. If you're a huge fan of the DC universe you will love the way these characters come to life on the big screen. While talk about how the movie was ""quickly put together"" does become visible in some scenes, it still does not take away from the fact that this is a nice new way of shooting DC films, especially with iconic villains in it and for future standalone movies with other DCEU villains or heroes for that matter.David Ayer did a really good job on allowing the actors to connect to one another behind the scenes in order to show genuine chemistry which I believe truly pays off if you consider how the villains interact with one another in the comic books. The chemistry does not feel forced. Like stated before, if you are a fan of the comics, you will enjoy the way these characters interact with one another.While I do agree that Will Smith's portrayal of Deadshot was missing something, it still does not make the bond between him and Harley any less significant. Also, Margot Robbie was definitely a kick ass part of this team. She truly embodied the attitude, charisma, and athleticism of Harley Quinn that we all know and love. The cameos were great and I hope to see future spin offs from certain characters such as Kitana, Deadshot, and of course the Joker.Now to the big cheese. Jared Leto's Joker is truly a nice take for the world Suicide Squad is set in. It makes sense that a maniacal crime boss would splurge on the outfits and cars seen in the movie. The only significant problem I had was his lack of screen time. I also think they could have shown more about how Harley and Joker's relationship was turbulent. Hopefully, with the director's cut, we will see in full form what Ayer originally had in mind.I only gave this such a generous rating because I really did love the movie. I did allow myself to walk in with a sort of non-bias mindset to see it from both a positive and negative prospective but I honestly could not contain myself from cheering to myself once the intro song rang throughout the theater. One problem I have with some of the critics' reviews is that I feel as though they walked in with the expectation of a Marvel movie in mind. It was definitely worth the watch in theaters and I will definitely buy the director's cut when it comes out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Very messy, very messy indeed .....","I have to say that it is usually quite easy to forgive the flaws in these superhero movies - you go and watch what is always going to be a fanciful movie with characters and plots that defy sense, and CGI stunts that blow your mind. This movie however does all of this without any semblance of a sensible plot, and with the distraction of the worst 'Joker' performance ever, in a plot stream that is irrelevant to the main movie scenario. I, like many others, have been waiting for this movie for a while, but overall I was extremely disappointed. I did quite like the performance of the prolific Margot Robbie - I seem to have seen her in 3 movies in the last 6 weeks - and Will Smith was passable as Deadshot, but the others were pretty poor.

Beyond salvation,"This film has the coolest villain entry I've seen in a long while. The scenes with Enchantress taking over her host body and the tentacle attacks of her brother in the very beginning were absolutely breathtaking. As was Margot Robbie's cute behind. Unfortunately, everything else was really really stupid.The thing is that there was the possibility to make this work, but somehow it turned into a badly edited amalgamation of ideas that don't belong together. What was Harley Quinn doing there? How did she further the story in any way? If you eliminate her, you don't need The Joker. Remove completely pointless characters like Katana and Boomerang and you had time for storytelling and character development and amazing action.But no, they had to dump all possible characters in this thing: Batman, Joker, Harley, Katana, Captain Boomerang, Diablo, Killer Croc. Killer Croc was a joke! Because of the heavy makeup you couldn't even recognize Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje even when you knew he was the actor and you could barely understand what he was saying.Plagued by indecision, the studios managed to completely mangle this movie, even if they let it all fall on the head of the guy who appears as both director and writer. From the cast you would think poor David Ayer was solely responsible for the entire film. In fact it's an army of IP lawyers and some money desperate people who are just as pointless as the characters they push down our throats.Bottom line: I can't imagine any way in which this production could have been saved by reshoots or reediting, it's that much of a mess. And it's infuriating because the potential and the people were all there! Will Smith was good, but I felt he was not the right man for the character.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Justice has an ugly side... a REAL UGLY side.,"Don't know exactly how to sum this up except that Ayer along with Snyder are going to be the death of any decent DCMU series. Wait, they are the death of the DCMU series. This one is worse than ""Dawn Of Justice"" (though I really liked that flick) in terms of pacing, direction, dialogue, characterization, and plot - what makes it different is the total miscasting of everyone except Marogot Robbie, who would be awesome if they made her less-sexualized and not white trash ICP looking. The only thing that was enjoyable was seeing Batman. Just a shame these rouges are one-dimensional juggalos he has to clean up after.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Bad movie with two bright spots,"Was it a romance? A rescue mission? Save the world? Who was the main character? This movie was bad from the beginning. The only bright spots were Deadshot and Diablo. The only two characters with any depth. The Rick Flag character was totally unbelievable as a Colonel, he just came across as a complete poser. They scraped the bottom of the barrel with this guy. Jared Leto as the Joker was pathetic, he was trying to be Heath Ledger's Joker and utterly failed. The story was bad, the characters were even worse, there were at least 4 different story lines that sort of ended up working together, but the two romances in the movie were bad. No chemistry, nothing holding anything together. It was a complete waste of 2 hours of my time. I should have gone with my daughter to see Secret Life of Pets. Don't waste your time. And DC? Please stop making movies.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A truly disappointing waste of film.,"Maybe Suicide Squad is not as bad as Man of Steel or Batman V Superman but still quite bad. As expected, it's poorly written on every level. Every single character feels shallow and one dimensional and again justlike the first two tries from the DCU it's as we all feared.Word of mouth will very much hurt this effort because the trailer tried to fool viewers in to thinking this movie is something it's not. It's mangled and, frankly, has no heart at all. I know blindly loyal fanboys everywhere are circling the wagons to praise this movie but that in and of itself proves what I'm saying. Fanboys wanted to like it and apparently will look past all of its flaws no matter what actually hits the screen. We saw it with BvS and we are seeing it here.Just like with BvS, everyone is saying or will soon be saying that Suicide Squad is a dumb popcorn flick at best but really nothing special. How can a film follow something that's bad two times over but still give anyone high expectations? Yet, thanks to good trailers, that's exactly what happened.The actual movie AGAIN leads to general disappointment especially if you're not already a fan. Campy, cheesy fluff pretending to be dark and serious usually fizzles out fast. Yet, as MOS and BvS proved this may be another indestructible franchise that won't die no matter how bad the stuff they churn out.A truly disappointing waste of film.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Thrilling and Unforgettable Ride: My 10/10 Review of Suicide Squad (2016),"There are movies you enjoy once and then forget about, and then there are those you can watch repeatedly without getting bored. Suicide Squad (2016) falls into the second category. No matter how often I've seen it, it keeps me entertained. It's a fun mix of action, humor, and a bit of darkness that hooks me every time. As an 18-year-old who loves a good story, cool visuals, and memorable characters, this film hits all the right spots.The whole idea behind Suicide Squad is pretty unique and exciting. It brings together a bunch of antiheroes-characters who aren't exactly the good guys but are thrown together to save the day. The movie does a great job with its ensemble cast; everyone brings something different. Each character makes an impression, whether it's their charm, backstory, or chemistry with the rest of the crew. I love watching these mismatched personalities clash, evolve, and eventually come together.One of the best things about Suicide Squad is its energy. The film moves at a crazy fast pace from start to finish. The action scenes are explosive and super creative, showcasing what each character can do. But it's not just about the incredible stunts or special effects; it's how the movie mixes those with humor and emotions. Even after seeing it countless times, I still find myself laughing at the funny lines, gasping at the intense moments, and genuinely caring about what happens to the characters.Another reason this movie is so easy to watch over and over is its look. The visuals are bright and bold, perfectly capturing the chaotic, rebellious vibe of the squad. The neon colors, gritty settings, and eye-catching character designs make every scene visually calm. The soundtrack is fantastic, filled with iconic songs that perfectly fit the action and mood. Even when I know what will happen, the combination of how it looks and the music pulls me right in.As a fan of superhero movies (or antihero movies, in this case), I like how Suicide Squad stands out from the rest. It doesn't follow the usual good versus evil story; instead, it digs into the gray areas of morality. These characters aren't exactly role models-they're flawed, complicated, and sometimes straight-up bad. Yet, the movie manages to make them relatable and even likable. It's a fresh take on the genre that keeps me coming back for more.That said, it's worth noting why this movie has a PG-13 rating, especially if younger viewers are interested. The rating mostly comes from the content-violence, strong language, and a few suggestive moments.In terms of violence, there are plenty of intense action scenes with fighting, explosions, and some imagery that might be disturbing. While it isn't overly gory, the fast-paced action is stylized, which might be too much for younger kids.Language is another thing to consider; there are a few strong words here and there. It doesn't dominate the movie, but it is enough to contribute to the PG-13 rating.There's also some nudity or suggestive stuff, but it's pretty tame compared to an R-rated flick. However, there are moments with revealing outfits, flirty dialogue, and a few situations that might raise eyebrows for younger audiences. For example, one character is dressed more for style than for coverage, and there are a couple of steamy moments. While nothing explicit happens, the implications might be something for parents to consider when deciding if it suits their teens.As an 18-year-old, I think the film strikes a good balance-it's edgy enough to fit with its wild and rebellious tone without crossing too far into inappropriate territory for a PG-13 audience. Still, I'd suggest parents check it out first or look at the Parents Guide on IMDb if unsure.Ultimately, I can confidently give Suicide Squad (2016) a solid 10/10 for entertainment. It's not trying to be a severe masterpiece; it knows exactly what it is: fun, wild, and unapologetically bold. With unforgettable characters, stunning visuals, thrilling action, and a fantastic soundtrack, it's a movie that I never get tired of watching.If you haven't seen Suicide Squad yet, definitely check it out. And if you have, give it another watch-it might surprise you with how much fun it still is. Whether it's your first time or you're watching for the fifteenth, this movie is a thrilling ride from start to finish.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Some excellent performances mired in a meaningless story,"Suicide Squad Movie ReviewA 'movie' can mean many things to many people. Some people see a 'film', consisting of characters engaged in stories that describe a plot. Some people see a massive spectacle of shiny things and loud sounds. Some people just want to smile a little for two hours.No one is 'right' or 'wrong'. You pay your money, and either you get something you enjoy, or you don't.If you're looking for a 'film', this is not it. There is no plot. The stories are flimsy at best, and non existent for long stretches. Some characters appear to have some depth once in a while, but not much, and not for long. Plenty of others are even shallower.If you're looking for a spectacle of shiny things and loud sounds, there's plenty of those, but Suicide isn't chocked full of them. There are bigger spectacles if that's what you want.If you just want to smile for a couple hours, then you may well be in luck. Will Smith (as Deadshot) is a Movie Star (capital M, capital S). He oozes charm. He gives his full effort and can pull off gravitas when needed, and timing for when comic relief is needed. Margot Robbie (as Harly Quinn) is his on screen equal, providing a demented gravitas and delivering her lines and actions with perfection. Between the two of them, they form an unlikely couple that at no point ever feels likely, yet doesn't feel forced. The movie rests on their shoulders entirely, but they are up to the task. While Smith and Robbie form the twin pillars supporting this movie, Viola Davis (as Amanda Waller) and Jared Leto (as The Joker) both put in fantastic performances.Davis plays the stock government agent who isn't afraid to bend the rules to get things done. It is an effortless performance, if anyone could run a shadow world government, it's Davis. The problem is the character simply has an arc that implodes. Davis's character feels worse than wasted, but rather deliberately turned into something useless.Similarly Leto's Joker is amazing and entirely pointless. My own 'idea' of the Joker is the Mark Hamill version from the Batman cartoons of the 90s. He's psychotic, but ultimately a crime lord. He wants to be rich. Jack Nicholson's Joker touched on this, but didn't really capture it. Heath Ledger's Joker is, a master performance, but still diminishes the character itself. Leto has captured the same energy that Ledger has tapped into, while grounding the Joker into the world as the psychotic crime lord. The thing is, there is no room in the plot of Suicide Squad for a psychotic crime lord, so Leto makes the most of his screen time, but, the time is not time well spent.There are other characters and actors in the movie. I don't remember who they are or what they do. Something about killing innocent people. The 'good' guys have a much higher body count than the 'bad' guys, although I'm starting to think that might be the go to move for DC comics movies.There are a LOT of bad things that I can say about this movie, but honestly, I liked it. Smith, Robbie, Leto and Davis bring it, and their performances deserve to be appreciated. If everyone else was cut out, and we focused on just these four, we might have something truly special.Instead, we just get something pretty good.I'm willing to spend 2 hours watching something pretty good.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A fun time at the movies,"Suicide squad is such a fun time at the movies so don't be discarded by all the hateful criticism and backlash this movie got when it first was released. I believe this movie to be a nice transition from David Ayer's past movie line up where they focused more on a lot of grit, action, crime, and drama. I'm not saying Suicide squad doesn't have any action because there is a lot of it but what I am saying is its nice to see a director get out of his comfort zone by taking on a movie, more specifically a comic-book movie which focuses on action and comedy. One addition to this movie that I really enjoyed was the music. I found myself lip syncing the words during every transition when a new song played in the background. There are familiar songs that most notably will be recognized by a more mainstream audience. The actors and characters are not to go un-noticed either. Even though Will Smith practically plays himself as the role of deadshot, it still doesn't take out the fact that you sort of like him and root for him to succeed in the long run. Margot Robbie as Haley Quinn will probably be most audience goers choice as the stand out of the whole movie which I do agree on at some aspects but the one character I feel I liked the most was Diablo. His character just appealed to me the most and I found myself wanting to see more of him on screen. Lastly I know most people who haven't scene the movie yet will probably be wondering about the Joker. All I can say is without spoiling it for you is that you will want to see more of him. Suicide squad is worth a watch whether it is in theaters or your streaming it at home, especially now that there will be an extended cut coming out soon.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"It's summer, it's fun, but  it's not a memorable movie.","""What is this? Cheerleading tryouts?"" DeadshotSuicide Squad is the most recent entry in the summer mayhem action movies, and it's distinctive only in its conceit: Assemble the baddest asses in the world from Louisiana's Belle Rive prison to eradicate even badder ones from somewhere else in the universe. Kind of like making a conscience-deficient dictator next president of the USA.Led by Deadshot (Will Smith), six dead souls, including the randy and dangerous Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), are recruited from lockup by the questionably-ethical government agent, Amanda Walker (Viola Davis). Their mission: Execute a black ops mission and receive clemency. Most sane operatives would not touch this group, much less give them license to kill, but these are desperate times because bad must beat bad as good has gone AWOL.What ensues is full of explosions and innumerable rounds of bullets, and oh, yes, a nice touch of a very sharp sword. If you can wade through the cacophony and carnage, there are a few lines like the one at the head of this essay worth noting and another: ""It's taken me some time, but I finally have them. The worst of the worst."" (Amanda Walker)I know what you're saying to yourself, can this be the best of the best lines, and I say it's difficult to find better. So focused is director David Ayer on the gymnastics of violence that he forgets crisp dialogue, or at least sardonic talk, such as in Guardians of the Galaxy and Deadpool, is more lethal than all the munitions you can muster.To show how off-center director and writers are, most of the first hour of the film is dedicated to the presenting the vitae of the six bad heroes. Then, when they finally meet each other, it seems we almost go through the bios we had in the first part of the film.Mostly it makes the dark Batman v Superman look like a birthday party. Even the love affair between Harley and The Joker (Jared Leto) is more like Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland, so full of over-the-top posing it is. Suicide Squad's squandering will make you remember the forgettable Fantastic Four. Yep, that boring.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Why so serious?,Wow. I can't believe this movie is getting so much hate. Really?

This movie is amazing.,"I don't know what's wrong with the critics nowadays, are they so jumpy on the Marvel Hype Train that they must hate every single type of competition, or any other reason, all I can say is that movie extremely pushes the DC Cinematic Universe into the fray alongside Marvel and that the movie is a Cinematographic marvel and that the casting is perfect.Margot Robbie is the best choice in the world for the psychotic Harley Quinn, alongside Jared Leto as her counterpart love they are an amazing couple, with the scenes of them together in their classic clothes, are just awesome. Jared Leto could have had more screen time in the movie as he feels unused and underrated.Will Smith also shines as Deadshot and I see no better choice for that role cast. The other characters while also underused are a very good addition to the squad, with El Diablo being my personal favorite.The comedy in the movie is spot on, no ""cheesyness"" like others would have you believe, and the whole theater hall laughed out loud a couple of times.In conclusion, the movie is an amazing adaptation for the Suicide Squad comics and we can only hope for a sequel.

A lame attempt,"The creators obviously tried to add some color and humor to the gloomy DC film universe, but the result is confusing. They reduced Nolan's pathos but there is still not much humor or authentic drama. The actors seems to have had much fun, a little bit of quarrels - in the end they got their money fee, and the audience got funny, but absolutely useless piece which personally I won't watch for the second time..In my view, Squad's obvious problem it is the script. In the beginning, we are quickly introduce us to the main characters in a completely disproportional way. Then a long and meaningless campaign without a single memorable action scene. What a waste Of money, time, characters. David Eyre couldn't cope with the blockbuster, so it is better for him to get back to the low-budget films. Villains are charismatic and funny to follow but their mission frustrates – it's not as suicidal as it should be. They are sometimes too good.

A Victim of fanboy childishness,"I'm not quite sure why it's taken me five years to getting around to seeing Suicide Squad.Perhaps it's because I heard it wasn't very good but having now seen it , I realise that it's a DC fanboy gripe thing and that's the reason it had bad ratings because it really is a pretty good film .A secret government agency recruits some of the most dangerous incarcerated super-villains to form a defensive task force. Their first mission: save the world from the apocalypse.I'm glad I didn't carry any baggage into watching the movie . I haven't read the comic books so I had no pre conceived ideas as to how this should be.I really enjoyed it .The characters are really good and you can't help but be on their side despite them being the so called bad guys.Margot Robbie is great at Harley Quinn. Jared Letto had big boots to fill in his role as joker and he just about pulls it off .Will Smith is much better than I expected as Deadshot.It also has a great soundtrack.If I had a criticism , it's the the Witch is pretty lame . Every super hero film needs a great enemy and Cara Delevigne as The Witch didn't work for me.Another reason for watching this now is that I plan to watch The Suicide Squad ( the follow up ) this week in the cinema and after this viewing , I'm really looking forward to it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not as bad as it's been made out to be,"I went to the cinema to see Suicide Squad with pretty low expectations if I'm honest. After reading numerous reviews by critics that made this film sound pretty much unbearable, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this really wasn't the case. Granted, it's not the best film I've ever seen, but it was definitely enjoyable to watch. Margot Robbie absolutely nailed the role of Harley Quinn, I couldn't get enough of her. Absolutely amazing. I thought that the vast majority of the other characters were brilliant as well, particularly Deadshot and Captain Boomerang. Although it is an aspect that I've seen mixed reviews on also, I loved the soundtrack and thought that it fitted really well with the film. However there were some bad points where I was beginning to understand the discontent towards the film. Firstly, I thought that Cara Delevingne was a truly atrocious actress. Every line she spoke was wooden, boring and almost made me cringe. I think that casting her was a huge mistake. Secondly, some parts were a bit naff and overdone (note, several overuses of never ending slow-mo). I also would've liked to have seen more of the Joker - from what I saw of him, I thought that Leto's portrayal of him did the role justice, but seeing as the advertising for the film is largely centered around his character, there really could've been more of him. Overall, I think Suicide Squad really is worth the watch and undeserving of the bad reviews it's been given.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great Movie,"I don't know what all the crybabies are whining about. This is a very well put together movie.

Jumbled Mess!!!,I'm not sure how this movie scores a 6.8 but it was horrible. I can only attribute that to hardcore comic book fans who are blind to it and love anything comic book. What a waste of millions of dollars making this movie. Obviously none of that money went into developing a script or an actual plot line because the movie lacked both. Suicide Squad was never a very popular comic so trying to force this movie was probably a bad idea. All the Jared Leto hype leading into this movie culminated in a huge dud. The lone bright spot was Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn but the makers of this movie pretty much wasted her as well. The two words in my summary say all you need to know. JUMBLED MESS!! It's scary to think that there are many more obscure characters from comics that are about to get their own movies and/or TV shows. This movie should be a blueprint for what not to do and it also shows that no matter how much money you throw at a movie if you have the wrong people in charge of making it then it will fail.,1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Five-Word Review: Often Enjoyable, Largely Disappointing & Bland","Even if you're David Ayer and you wrote Training Day and directed Fury, bringing together a bunch of comic-book Batman villains that have never been in a live-action film along with a new iteration of The Joker was always going to be hard, and messy. With acclaimed actors like Will Smith, Margot Robbie, and Jared Leto, though, it should also be hard to mess up.I was really looking forward to Suicide Squad. Batman vs Superman: DoJ kick-started DC's cinematic universe in divisive fashion, with too many subplots and rocky direction that felt like it was too influenced by the studio. Suicide Squad, after some fantastic trailers, looked set to successfully navigate these problems. However. Its main problem, unfortunately, is feeling too much like a generic comic-book film, especially in the second half (the first half, however, is great - see below). Instead of going a unique route of having a team of morally ambiguous, blackly comic villains fight and work amongst themselves, perhaps uniting against a wild card like The Joker, we get a ham- fisted team up against some otherworldly entity (BvS anyone?) aided by faceless minions (Avengers anyone?). Comic book fatigue indeed.Another problem is the widely-advertised re-shoots that were ordered of Ayer after critical backlash in the spring targeted BvS's dull, mirthless mindlessness. Too often, the film feels choppily edited, with several portions of the film feeling like they were directed by different directors before all these sections were Frankensteined together. This seems a clear indication that there is too much 'higher up' involvement in the making of these cinematic universe films. Ayer's vision can be glimpsed through the mess, especially in the first half. His vision of The Joker as a tattooed, pimp-like, mob-boss gangster is commendable, but falls prey to reshuffling and the apparent removal of several of his scenes. Flashes of brilliance, such as viewing Batman through the eyes of Deadshot and Harley Quinn, are brilliant: the vigilante is seen as a terrifying, meddling threat who splits families apart and keeps true loves from each other. A lot, however, is lost as the film suffers from the curse of post-production reshuffles.But I digress, as Suicide Squad really isn't THAT bad. The first half especially is a joyful romp which unfortunately does not indicate the tone of the film overall. The character introductions could not have been done better, with tongue-in-cheek visual effects and on-screen writing giving a sens of the characters, and a great mix of flashback and scenes of the characters in prison providing excellent contrast. Most of the gags and humour hits (most, but definitely not all), though it would have been nice if the creators had more independence to target an older audience, perhaps focusing on why these guys are so bad. In a film that is a very, very soft 15 certificate, it is hard to display the remorseless murders and horrific crimes that they have done, and the film could have benefited from some good black comedy. The acting is a mixed bag - Robbie is simply superb, the stand-out with what is one of the only complicated roles in the film, whilst Viola Davis excels and Smith is a solid lead. Leto is alright, though nowhere near the heights reached by the likes of Heath Ledger and Mark Hamill. It often feels like he is trying too hard to be edgy and crazy, coming across as almost Jim Carrey-like at times. His screen-time is relegated to mostly token appearances, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it means more time devoted to the bland Joel Kinnaman and the eye-rollingly boring villain Enchantress, played by an over-the-top and possibly miscast Cara Delevingne (though who could sell this properly: http://tinyurl.com/zh4w52t).Basically, though, none of the characters are given enough time to bond like they say they are. Jai Courtney, doing his best Tom Hardy impression, is a promising side-character but is very underused, and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's Killer Croc is basically useless. There are significant swathes of the film which are really enjoyable and fun, with the soundtrack simply wonderful, but there are just too many inherent problems. Uneven direction, often laughable dialogue, choppy last-minute editing, and a plot which just went in the wrong direction. It simply can't cut it at the top of the blockbuster world, and is unfortunately for me a large disappointment, especially due to all the promising signs I saw in the film.Maybe this is the comic-book film fatigue building up steam, but studios really need to change something in order to keep their cinematic universes being such reliable cash cows. Marvel's Doctor Strange looks intriguing - though if Suicide Squad proved anything, it was that trailers, however incredible they are, do not provide an indication of the film - and their Civil War was often refreshing, but there needs to be consistent adaptation. To quote Frank Underwood (fine, Winston Churchill), to improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often. If the Affleck- directed Batman film, the hopefully different Aquaman, and Justice League can learn from the mistakes of BvS and Suicide Squad, then DC will prosper. Until then, films such as this Suicide Squad are just not good enough. Mostly enjoyable, and probably worth a watch, but just not one to ever re-watch and unlikely to delight anyone over the age of 14. 55/100.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not that bad.,"It is very entertaining. But the plot is non existant. There was so much potential with these characters. After Batmam V Superman, which in my opinion was not that bad and was an amazing movie, i was expecting a banger of a film. But I think all of our expectations were just too high. One of the big downsides to this movie is that some characters have no depth. Like asian ladies husbands dead, but thats all we know. Boomerang is just there, along with killer croc. The other three have good backstories, and I believe that Jared Leto was a good Joker. He just seems like hes from a cartoon. Not bad. But Not good either. Hes defenently no Heath Ledger. The writers kind of screwed him over. He would have been great if the material was better. Harleys backstory is
one of the pros in this movie. Along with deadshot and Fire Guy. VFX were cool, its just the story. Overall entertaining and enjoyable, nothing unbearable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

It was good but in my opinion I think the trailers were better. The thing is that the plot was good, the characters were so cool, but there was one thing that made the movie sink a little: they rushed it. There was no character development, except for Deadshot, Sergeant Flag and Harley. The others were like sidekicks and didn't get enough screen time.

A great big noisy mess,"This film really does not deserve an in-depth analytical review. It is 25% exposition and 75% whatever. It also gives us a Joker portrayed by a method actor who knows how to internalize a character, but not how to project the character (the latter being why Ledger was so great). Leto's Joker is just as lame, unbelievable, and indescribably annoying as Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. 
Rather than picking the thing apart, perhaps it is best said that WB/DC should simply pretend that this movie never happened, then recast the Joker before The Batman is made. I wish they would to the same with Luthor. (Why is it that Marvel can do such a good job but DC can't? It's because Marvel knows how to cut through the Hollywood BS and hire the right people and DC doesn't.)",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not so bad,"PROS:background songs are well selected, actors are very good although some are no so famous, good theme music and sound engineering, very good video tricks. the scenes related to the joker are highly artistic, colourful, creative and inspiring, this part alone is worth the ticket. CONS:weak or almost no story and has a lot of discrepancies, and does not make sense in a few scenes. A few characters are redundant, whether they exist or removed from movie it will have ZERO effect on the movie. movie time can be cut a lot lot shorter, so you expect many scenes are made up and do not add anything to the story. Verdict:If were a shallow person looking for empty entertainment, this one is what you should see.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Squad Good, Nemeses Bad","The crux of most comic book movies is meta-humans (as DC calls them) or superheroes. The quality of that movie will be largely based upon the abilities of said super beings although a good story wouldn't hurt. Now we're at a near saturation point with comic book movies which absolutely necessitates a good tale as well as some very unique skill sets from the heroes. If the skill sets are not very unique those abilities better be displayed in a new and unique way.Suicide Squad was a collection of meta-humans (though one of the members wasn't really meta she was just meh) that were tasked with helping extract a VIP from a super-villain stronghold.Of the members of this motley crew I think Deadshot (Will Smith) was the most likable. He was witty and had the most character. Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnouye-Agbaje), and Boomerang (Jai Courtney) were just there and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) was a nuisance. Her character, beyond being superfluous, was very annoying with her on- again off-again pseudo-Brooklyn accent. But this was the Suicide Squad and I watch comic book movies.The story and the climactic battle were very so-so. Whereas I did have a concerted interest in who won the battle, I wasn't very impressed with the nemesis; and that's a problem. Besides being a demigod type character the main nemesis kept gyrating as though that was the source of her power. It just looked ridiculous.Along with these mankind-hating meta-meanies I wasn't keen on the unnecessary additions of Harley Quinn and the Joker (Jared Leto). I know I'm speaking from a position of Suicide Squad source material ignorance but I'm grading the movie like a novice as most viewers will be. Harley Quinn and the Joker were almost a side story that--beyond being distracting--was irritating. Jared Leto is the third rendition of the Joker (post 1989) and his is the worst in my opinion. Jack Nicholson was somewhat humorous, Heath Ledger was a mad genius bent on anarchy and Jared Leto was just a madman with make-up on and very forgettable.I liked the Squad. They were a group of which the whole was greater than the sum of its parts. I even liked their controller. Spruce up the antagonists, lose the Joker (leave him for the Batman movies) and make Harley Quinn more useful than for eye candy and the movie is a lot better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Nothing makes sense in this movie,"First, I'd like to say that I read all the bad reviews before going to the theater. I was hoping for some kind of miracle but it did not happen.The movie was just awful.I am not a Marvel or DC fan but it is fair to say that the last two DC movies sucked big time.No character development, too many characters, a very bad Joker, Margot's acting was terrible. I feel like the Witch was actually an interesting character. Will Smith as Deadshot is just Will Smith. Some jokes were really not funny like the one about the browser history, seriously?I'll save you time, the reviews were right. Skip that movie!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I love it. I Haven't watched a better movie in years. Its doesn't deserve the hate,"I really enjoyed every bit of this movie, not one scene did i find boring. I haven't watched something this good in years. I love the story line. Almost Everything is perfect about this movie. And ""most"" people who think its bad is because they are reading what critics are saying.they are saying its a basic plot it definitely is not they are so many surprises,.. From the reviews i was reading Going into this movie i thought it was going to be horrible and one of the worst movies ever i came out surprised. The joker is in my opinion the best character in the movie his role only lasts 15 minutes but its enough. I was amazed by him. Harley Quinn was amazing they captured her very well. Deadshot was great too i actually didn't like him from the trailers but after watching the movie i love him. The movie made me like all the characters. I like them so much that now I'm collecting their toys. Another reason why this movie is good is because you've got a little bit of everything Action, Comedy, Sadness, Drama. I hope they will be making a second part very soon. But There is one problem about this movie. that is Picking Cara Delevingne as the role was a huge mistake. Her acting was horrible everything was horrible about her that is the only flaw in the movie. Before this i never liked villain and superhero movies i was never even a fan of dc. But after watching suicide squad i definitely am. I love it! And to anyone thinking of not watching the movie because of what critics are saying are making a huge mistake the movie is amazing and i am sure you will like it. I am so amazed by this movie",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This movie is fun and better than average but fail to deliver the teamwork of suicide squad,"First of all, i have knowledge on DC comic characters. I know what those villains(i mean suicide squad) can do. However this movie just does not show much. Basically, u're just watching those villains joining together in a squad trying to get job done.(working together? ... not really).It does not introduce all of the characters well, this movie only show the surface of them(their power) and not much personality.I believe most of the people want to see .... ""teamwork"" , the bond between the squad members. You wont see how they understand each other well(Where is the conflict since they all have different personality), they just all become friends or partners since they join the squad， except the boss who they hated of course.This movie also does not show how they work together with their abilities during the fight. For example, Deadshot shooting alone , Harley fighting alone , Killer Croc punching alone, soldier shooting. This does have action scene but we cant see the villains teamwork performance especially fighting together. It's like you wont feel anything important on those characters.Batman: Assault on Arkham， this animated film actually did an awesome work on those villains. And i must say this animated film is better than this movie if u want to know what is the real suicide squad can do.OK Story， The story is straight forward and not much depth, it does have some twist but not so much influence on the main story. The Bad Guy in this movie is also ""straight forward"". Even the relationship between squad members are .... ""straight forward"", so this might be the reason some people don't like this movie. But it is still fun if you enjoy the movie.Actors performance， i will say good on most of the cast. you will not disappointed. And Jokers in this movie does not shine because the limit of his scene time(don't expect too much from Joker).Soundtrack is awesomeThis movie can be better,it may disappointed on people who have high expectation. For me, i want the suicide squad (villains working together） to shine, but sadly i didn't see that. It's like an adventure with the suicide squad, u will enjoy it. But if u want to understand the squad or feel the importance of them, then i might say no. Not sure if PG-13 limit the potential of this movie, but i guess it can be more epic if it's 18.There is a mid credit scene, so wait a while before u leave.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Makes me wanna commit SUICIDE via firing SQUAD,"I don't know where to begin with, this, um... film? Oddly enough it too suffers the same problem; it doesn't know what it is or wants to be. You can liken its handling of story-telling with a bull in a china shop. But I may as well dig into the meat and potatoes of this ""really, really bad"" film.One aspect often cited in praise of the film, are the performances and chemistry, notably of and between Will Smith and Margot Robbie. Smith is fine as the sharpshooter Deadshot, He's a roguish Will Smith, what more can I say. I feel Robbie put her all into the ""deranged"" Harley Quinn, but the writing for her character erred too much on the side of goofy, to be believable. And this goes for all the characters in the film really, they all have their one-dimensional, underdeveloped roles and any character attempting to be funny merely served as a one-liner dispenser and not a particularly good one. These are supposed to be despicable (soon to be reformed) ""bad-guys"" but their characters are so thin and underwritten that they end up coming off less intimidating than a door mouse. And when the film tries to hunker down (in a bar) to get all serious; it's so unearned, cartoony and cheesy, for there to be any emotional heft whatsoever, feeling more like a box to tick than an artistic choice.The structure of the film is, by and large, the biggest issue. It's already been said countless times, but the editing was childish and amateur at best. the first half of the film serves as a consecutive set of trailers for presumably, better stand alone films. The sequences were littered with forced and ill-fitting songs whose soul purpose was to inject the film with character where the writing, directing and acting could not. The second half serves as a predictable low-stakes action film. It was filled to the brim with pointless, uninteresting antagonists, whose plan is just as flimsy as their dialogue; a ridiculous spectacle ending that made no sense and action sequences with pointless, faceless goons.Sprinkled throughout were poor character development, bland expository dialogue and ham-fisted attempts at being emotional. It doesn't help when I'm taken out of the film every five seconds to think about the relentless amount of plot holes, contrivances, and continuity errors that could fill two small estates. The one saving grace was Jared Leto's silly portrayal of The Joker, who, while not getting the reaction from me Leto probably intended, had me sniggering all the way through his scenes. As for Viola Davis' Amanda Waller, well let me say the film is way out of her league; I think she'd be more intimidating in a better-written movie. Other than Leto, the film is a bore.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Better than I expected, but far from what it might have been","Maybe it was the vicious reviews that led me to over compensate and be somewhat pleasantly surprised by this. Of course, I'm not the core audience, being well into middle age and not generally a fan of the comic book movie universe. That once very entertaining world now feels played out and repetitive to me, no matter how high tech the special effects.But I did love Deadpool and Guardians of the Galaxy- largely for hijacking and making fun of the formulas. And that's probably why I liked (not loved) Suicide Squad. While not as successful at biting the hand that bore it as those other two comic films that refused to play by the rules, it still has fun with darkness and light and all our preconceptions about heroes and villains.Indeed, it could have been flat out terrific, but two substantive problems held it back. First, the core plot is as silly, illogical and uninspiring as any in the weakest of the genre. Just because the film is more about the characters than the story doesn't mean there's couldn't have been something a little more imaginative to hang the tale on.And, perhaps even more damningly, for a film that purports to be a sort of 'Dirty Dozen' of the comic book world, its villains turned anti-heroes are nowhere near 'anti' enough. They're all entertaining lightweights in the moral division. If they've done bad things you can be sure it was always for good reasons and/or they feel really bad about it. Instead of forcing us into the juicy, morally messy joy of forcing us relate to some really bad 'heroes', these are more misunderstood victims with superpowers then Walter Whites who happen to also be able to make things fly or explode. And that's too bad, because with more bite, edge and embrace of punky anarchy this could have been that rare popcorn movie is truly subversive, instead one that mildly, if sometimes entertainingly, play acts at it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Entertaining but utterly disappointing,"For what seems like a lifetime we have been getting some of the best trailers for this movie, the images shown and perfectly sewn in soundtracks promised something new from the DCU, something fresh and relevant and while the final product could be called entertaining in a music video kind of way the bland plot, terrible villain and some of the secondary characters drag it down to an utterly mediocre, if not bad, levels.It's one saving grace is that most of the Suicide Squad themselves have some real chemistry and while controversial Jered Leto's Joker is captivating if not completely in line with what is expected of the titular 'mad man'.Is it worth paying to go see it, that is completely up to the viewer, I don't think any fan of super hero movies will feel ripped off by it as it hits the mark with a few one liners and set pieces but don't expect a DC version of Guardians of the Galaxy.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Bad Good Guys? or Good Bad Guys?,"Lets get straight to it!Cons: Film struggled with direction the entire time. Some points they're truly ""bad guys"", other moments they just seem like costume crusaders.Plot was pretty flimsy. They didn't reach any far surfaces of the brain with this story. No plot twist either.The entire movie, as long as it is, just moved way to quickly. Character building was not a thing in this film. This movie had so much potential to have sequels, but you can clearly tell they will have 1-2 spin offs.Characters! 3 out of the entire cast were the main focus. Everybody else was just.....there! (!!!spoiler spoiler!!!) Why even have a character introduced if you were just going to kill them within 5 minutes, was it a role or a cameo?Jared Leto, he can act, but in my personal opinion, he did a horrible job as joker. Out of all the actors who've played Joker i'd rate him the lowest. I just didn't feel like he was evil or insane. I didn't get any sense of fear, from his portrayal.Pros: Acting! Viola Davis as always, is a beast. She knows how to command your attention. Will Smith was at the front of almost every scene. That was both good and bad. Margot Robbie, stole every scene she was in, it was hard not to love her. She portrayed Harley Quinn to the T, down to the voice and mannerisms. Oh! and Jai Courtney, this was probably his best role ever, if he gets more work in Hollywood it'll be because of this movie. I always viewed him as the new Colin Farrell, want to ruin your movie? Hire this dodo!The CGI was too much, but was done very well.Casting! The entire cast worked really well together, nobody seemed like a bad fit, other than Jared Leto.Conclusion: Film had so much potential to be incredibly epic, but in the end I feel fell short. Should have spent more time on Character development, and on the plot. The plot was just so over exaggerated and plain. It was a good film, with good production and a great cast that played there parts really well(minus Leto) but the plot just was so dull and boring. 7/10 DVD Collection must have, but not a favorite",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Trailer was great, movie was terrible.","I haven't wrote a review here in at least 10 years now. Dusted off my account to do it because of this movie. This is SPOILER FREE review, so no worries.I don't usually complain about anything thats made into a movie from somewhere else. But this trailer REALLY made the movie look good. But it turned out to be pretty bad.They tried to fit a massive story into one small movie. It felt rushed and badly edited. Didn't really give you time to think about anything and no real character development. Mind you I know the story, but it didn't well how they put it on screen. Batman v Superman was better sadly.The Joker seems terrible. His tattoos were a bad idea as were the silver dental work and overall ""over board"" insane level. His persona not like the Joker we've seen so much in the past. It felt like Leto was trying to hard to make the Joker different. Harley wasn't to badly done. The rest of the people were close enough to their comic book selves.And I'm glad they tied in the other DC movies into this. Stay past the end credits to see why. The CGI was really nice in the movie, better then I thought it would be. I can tell though they reedited the movie like the said they did. Originally the movie did not have the music it did. Movie also felt all over the place at times. Thankfully as I said I know about the story, but I can see why many who don't know it would feel a bit lost and bored.Overall I'd say its a 5.5 out of 10. Its sad that this broke Guardians of the Galaxy's record in terms of money earned. All this goes to show you can't always go by a movies trailer.

trainwreck of ego battles,"with all of the hype generated around the commitment of the actors to their roles, this movie really boils down to a handful of actors all jockeying for a chance to steal the show and possibly launch a film franchise. you have will smith trying to steal the show with a lovable father/worlds greatest assassin (does he take her with him on his constant international travels? ya think?) with a heart of gold representation of deadshot. but the film maker also decided to really commit to the harley quinn narrative, and in order to introduce her to the audience as well, they needed an origin story to compel the new audience members to connect to her. which meant that the joker had to come along for the ride, and of course in order to play the joker you have to deal with the fact that the last guy knocked it out of the ballpark, and you will never live up to that. which seems to have motivated Jared Leto to latch on to an extremely undeserved ego trip over his character. he is a supporting character to a side narrative, and yet he battled to turn himself into a central character by ""sacrificing"" for the role so much the director felt compelled to shoe horn in some more screen time. when in all honesty, it would have been WAY more compelling and creepy if this movie had not even revealed who the next joker would be, by always playing the joker as a shadow figure. that way the obsession and devotion that harley gets to play with is projected on to a character that is unknowable and unrelatable to any of the audience. it would have really given room for her to explore the depths of harleys idol worship if the joker had essentially been ""kaiser soze"" for one film. but instead we got a hot topic die antwood and a cutesey bad boy crush. meanwhile a slew of lesser known actors are all desperately trying to get noticed by committing so hard to their characters they ended up making it all about themselves. what you end up with is a shallow caricature development movie with a bunch of off brand comic book characters who's backstory needs to be shoe horned in to a feature length film.on top of bad writing, and over over the top character choices. the look of the film was reminiscent of 1987's Masters of the Universe. for an action and visual effects driven story, there seems to have been given very little effort toward filming it in a visually interesting way. in fact the very few cinematically artistic moments that appear in the film are all devoted to the sub plot with harley and the joker. which is only supposed to be harleys origin story, not the main focus of the whole film. the rest of the film has lots of poorly lit battle sequences in city streets, with propane poofers back lighting rubber suited stunt men. oh, and there are a ton of random laser shots flying around for good measure....",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Hopefully a wakeup call for the DCEU's future.,"Suicide Squad is fundamentally one of those ""if done correctly"" stories. Even before you embark on the journey this movie takes you on, you ask yourself ""if the threat is so big, why not call any of the good guy superheroes in this universe?"" And the movie struggles to answer that - instead elects to brush the question to the side with a mindless suggestion that the world needs a line of defense in case Superman falls out of line. The band of characters we follow throughout the story are remarkably unlikable and a handful of them are given virtually nothing to do in the plot. If you subscribe to the logic of ""your movie is only as good as it's villain"" you would certainly be right in the case of this movie because the threat that looms over the movie spends a lot of the time bordering between ""immensely boring"" and ""logically ridiculous"".Suicide Squad also brings us the first live action film adaptation of ""The Joker"" since Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight, and I don't think Jared Leto comes anywhere near matching the larger than life Joker portrayals we've seen anywhere in the past, quite possibly being the worst Joker we've ever seen in a movie. I don't want to write off Margot Robbie's portrayal of Harley Quinn however, with a proper script and story to fit into I think she can do Quinn justice. I wouldn't recommend checking this one out, it will surely be a disappointing film.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A good kind of disaster,"So I seen the movie, in an early premier at my local theater. Such excitement I thought the movie would bring. I sat down with a large popcorn and soda. My two favorite DC villains were there, Joker and Harley Quinn. But when the movie started... Oh it was a disaster. A good kind of disaster of course. First of all the prince of madness, the clown himself the brand new joker. Is a new kind of joker. Jared Leto. Is a perfect candidate to play the mad driven trickster. Astonishing performance all around. For the other cast mates astonishing performance through and through as well. Now for the movie, the movie was a disaster, I feel as if the Film wanted to have a little compromise between the marvel's light and yet action packed thriller with laughs all around. That's what I thought, It's a dark sinister film, but I feel as if they were trying to make a little more ""marvel"" tone to the aspect of this film.

Bad. Bad. Bad.,"This film grated on me from the moment it began. It is definitely did something for me. And that something was being overstimulating, chaotic, and boring all at once.Will Smith's played the dullest supervillain alive while most of the others were shockingly obnoxious culminating with Jared Leto's ""Joker"" character. He embodies a joke all right- a joke against the whole of the craft of acting. I hope the stories about his on-set behavior aren't true. But if they are- I can completely understand given the energy his character exudes.Margot Robbie plays Harley Quinn, but (as usual) is channeling the character of Margot Robbie. This movie could have been good. It had potential. But that potential was squandered by the producers and whatever sinister corporate overlords that oversaw this production.I will not be tricked into watching the sequel.

I Don't Get The Hate,"Story? There is no story. And that's what's refreshing about this movie. It's pure entertainment, in the sense of ""Voltron,"" ""A-Team"" or ""G.I.

No.I'm so sick and tired of political messages jammed into Marvel movies (I think comic book movies on DC & Marvel are dumb to begin with). They happen to be the most offensive of the two. I suppose THIS constitutes what the world enjoys now...supposedly. Or the PC police critics.I can't begin to tell you how nice it is NOT to have social agendas in a movie and just...have fun. The hate may stem from the people who love these characters in the book. I can't justify any of it, since I don't read the funny pages, but it seemed to anger a lot of fans of the characters. Personally, Leto's Joker is...too comical for the grit of this movie. He's not as bad as you want him to be or as fun as Nicholson made him out to be.

Suicide Squad is thoroughly enjoyable,"There are aspects of the film that do let it down, I'll admit. The plot isn't very strong, Killer Croc was lame and some of the lines were corny. Other than that, it was spot on. Dark, funny, action- packed, there isn't a lot more you could want from a Comic-book movie. They did a really good job portraying outlandish comic book villains like Captain Boomerang, someone who by all accounts should have been super lame, and making him into a very likable character.

Deadshot, Boomerang, Killer Croc, Katana, Harley Quinn, Joker all get their due, which was great to see. Diablo was a breakout character, and had some great sentimental, and action scenes. Enchantress was really well done, loved her transformations into June Moon. Viola Davis was amazing as Amanda Waller. The plot was pretty linear, and the villain was, well, was just there to move the plot along and something for the squad to fight. A lot of humor felt forced, or out of place. There are some truly good one liners not shown in the trailers, but most of them were, which I predicted.

"descent movie with good action,comedy but a weak plot","A VFX aided movie with no good script.The movie gives a adventures plot from various sites like prison and Crime headquarters.Although Will Smith and Margot Robbie gave wonderful performance ,the movie could not provide full entertainment as the story has same usual ending. Action scenes performed by all the artists was awesome and well executed.The movie direction was very good and each character was very well described with some humour involved.The way the movie introduces Batman in few scenes also excites his fans but atlast leave them dishearted as his presence is just for amusement sake.Also the concept is very weak and fails to attract the attention of the movie.The role of Jared Leto as Joker is given less importance which is quite disturbing for the audience.The role of Viola Davis is absolutely unquestionable as well as fully satisfying and enjoying.The movie also revolves around the theme of love and affection which is displayed pretty well.The movie has good mix of humour,romance,action but a common story line makes the movie simply a VFX show.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best movie I have ever seen. It is AMAZING,"This is by far my favorite movie ever. And I am quite surprised. I was looking forward to seeing it but was a bit put off by the horrible reviews it received. During and after the movie however, I marveled at the amazing acting, costumes, special effects, and overall story line. My favorite characters are most definitely the unstoppable duo that is the Joker and Harley Quinn. Jared Leto and Margot Robbie nailed their performances to a t. I know how intimidating it must have been to portray Mr J after Heath Ledger, but Leto was amazing (and very intimidating). The portrayal was believable, intriguing, and incredibly scary. I loved it! He only appears quite briefly but in the scenes he was in, he was outstanding! As for Robbie, she was a star and lit up the screen every time she appeared. The only ""negative"" part of this movie was Cara Delevingne's acting, which I felt was not up to par with the others and the importance of her character. Though in the end it didn't matter because Suicide Squad was amazing! I have no idea what the critics were thinking and am very confused as to why they hated it. I await the sequel with anticipation and hope that Mr J and Harley make more of an appearance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I thought it was good and it deserves better,I thought the dialogue was good and it never should have that much hate to it and besides yes Harley should have a better outfit but other than that it felt like a kid version of the new one which was alright.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The trailer was more fun than the movie,"Suicide Squad is fun. Unfortunately, it's not as fun as the trailer made it out to be. This movie succeeds when it comes to creating the stylized look and feel of a comic book, but the frantic pacing and the flimsy plot fall a bit short on the screen. Nevertheless, Margot Robbie does a great job as Harley Quinn and Will Smith is effective as Deadshot. Leto's Joker, though, feels like a missed opportunity. I was entertained by this film - it's just not the game changer I hoped it would be.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"The Right Idea, But Still Not That Good","DC had the right idea with ""Suicide Squad"". They really did. Instead of the plodding seriousness of films like ""Man of Steel"" or ""Batman vs. Superman"", this one was meant to let loose and have a little fun. While it did accomplish that goal, unfortunately it just isn't a very good film, overall.For a basic plot summary, ""Suicide Squad"" sees government agent Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) put together a team of mercenaries to do some dirty work so that the government won't have to get it's own hands dirty. Ostensibly led by Deadshot (Will Smith) and prominently featuring Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), this group of ragtag ""bad guys"" tries to thwart a plan hatched by the evil Enchantress (Cara Delavigne). Lurking on the fringes of everything? The Joker (Jared Leto), stirring up trouble everywhere he goes.There is a lot of fun to be had in this movie (especially during the first half of runtime). Director David Ayer creates a wacky, madcap atmosphere with all the crazy pieces falling into place, and it really is a lot of fun. Smith has the perfect personality for Deadshot, while Robbie's Quinn is easily the best thing to come out of the whole experience. Leto's Joker is engaging, and just the entire concept is fresh and new.Sadly, things take a real nosedive after that solid first half. As soon as a plot needs to be introduced, the whole thing falls apart. Maybe the saddest part of the whole ordeal? They seemed to be very correctable mistakes that just weren't identified and fixed. I don't want to give away any spoilers, so I can't go too deep into what I felt were late-film mistakes, but the biggest faux pas for me was that the tenor of certain characters really changed from beginning to end. Not helping matters is that there isn't anything resembling the word ""deep"" in the whole movie. So, basically, as soon as things have to start making sense and adding up...they don't.I really wish I could give ""Suicide Squad"" a higher rating than this (2.5 stars would be my exact mark), but I just can't because, as a whole, it doesn't deserve it. It establishes an interesting Joker, an incredible Harley, and has a bit of fun in the first half...but that isn't enough to make it a great film. I know that rumors of studio meddling plagued this project until practically up to the release date, so perhaps that had a lot to do with why the tone seemed to change so much at times and why the characterizations seemed a bit off from beginning to end.The final verdict: If Leto's Joker, Robbie's Quinn, and Affleck's Batman were to have a movie to themselves (with perhaps Smith's Deadshot lurking in the corners), that would be something to get excited about. Everything else in ""Suicide Squad"" is either a total miss or decidedly lukewarm.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Not trash, but neither treasure.","For the record, I wish to state that I don't read the comics, my interest in these characters is casual. I was excited for this film, hoping that it would be the break DC and Warner needed to perhaps challenge the Marvel machine. When this film came out and the news trickled down to me that it just another disappointment, I almost chose not to see it.I'm glad I saw it anyway.Those that say this movie is a disaster are over reacting. I'm not saying it's perfect; the first act is weighed down with lengthy introductions of the Squad. It does have a problem with pacing and focusing attention where it should. Harley Quinn and Deadshot get layers of attention and backstory, while some characters are simply thrown in.I must mention Jared Leto. Some complain he doesn't leave a huge impression and falls flat; I argue no. The Joker is not a member of the Suicide Squad, therefore not a main player of the movie. Sure, we all like to see plenty of Joker, but Harley Quinn takes the spotlight, as she should. This is HER movie, not his. And hey, we can't all be Heath Ledger's Joker.Overall, I enjoyed it. I hope they bring out the promised Harley Quinn spin off.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I walked out,"I tried to like. I really did. But with too many plot holes, predicatble chracters, poor chracter development, and cringey one liners, I had to leave. The only interesting thing about this movie is the costumes.The music was pandering way too much and seemed as though it was there just to try and elevate a scene that was ****. Batman, out of every superhero has the best rogue's gallery hands down. And this movie made me hate every single one.I never want to see another Zach Snyder film again. Why studios keep throwing money at him, I'll never know. It seems as if he's perfectly fine catering to cringey/edgey teens who only shop at hot topic and like abusive relationships.If you love DC at all, or even commics for that matter, do NOT see this movie.

What Can I Say? I Like Crap,"This is one of those unexplained aspects in my life to where reasons and comprehension are thrown out the ****ing window. I can't even rationalize why I liked this movie. I understand that Suicide Squad is annoying at times. The scene where the girl cries like a little stupid b!t(# because she doesn't want Deadshot to shoot Batman was so irritating I actual wish she got shot in her ugly face. Croc was a stupid villain. The Witch was stupid. The ever infamous bar scene was one those scenes that will make some feel mortified even when you are watching this alone. The story, though easy to follow, was unfocused and retarded. So, yes, I can't explain why I liked this movie but I do.Well, this is what I liked about Suicide Squad. I actually like some the acting performances. The chick who played Harley Quinn, Joker, Deadshot were the ones who stood out while the others were descent enough at best. I liked the action and the effects. And well that's about it.I gave this movie a 7 and I know it doesn't deserve even half that amount but what can I tell you?

Entertaining but not as good as expected,"I was looking forward to watch suicide squad. I love DC comics but I'm not a huge fan of their cinematic universe. Suicide squad looked different than the previous dceu movies and that was the main reason for my excitement.I loved the characters in the movie. Margot Robbie did a great job, she sounded exactly like Harley Quinn from batman: the animated series. She was childish and lovable yet really insane.I was kind of worried when they announced that Will Smith was going to play Deadshot, I felt like he doesn't fit the role but I'm glad I was proved wrong. I loved every scene his character was in and I also loved his back story.I wasn't a huge fan of El diablo, Rick Flag and Boomerang before the movie but I absolutely loved them after it especially Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag, I loved the romance between him and Enchantress' alter ego, June moon.The character that disappointed me was the Joker. I know that Jared Leto is a good actor and I know that he had so much to give to the role but he doesn't appear that much, most of his scenes in the trailers were cut out from the movie which made him an unnecessary character. I don't blame Leto for this, it's absolutely a wrong decision made by the director. I was expecting to see Harleen Quinzel becoming Harley Quinn but instead we got a one minute scene explaining her back story.The editing in my opinion was really bad, the action sequences were messy and hard to keep up with. The third act was weak and the same goes to the villain.Overall, suicide squad is another generic comic book movie but it was very entertaining. I didn't feel bored while watching it. I loved the humor and the characters. Compared to other huge let downs this summer, suicide squad was a decent movie. I expected something better but that didn't prevent the movie from being enjoyable.7/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Be careful Reading Reviews From Non Comic Book Readers. Suicide Squad Is a Prime Example!,"Like with so many Superhero setting movies, I've noticed that there is a fair amount of supposed critics that rate these movies knowing nothing about the comic origins, including some of the canons of these great Characters. I wish these same critics would stop rating Superhero movies because they are giving it an unfair review with their murky at best knowledge (and I'm sure not all fall in this bracket but a fair amount do). I'd rather listen to comic reader's points of view when it comes to Superheroes and Supervillains coming to the big screen. That been said I'm not saying if you don't read comics and graphic novels not to go see these movies, all I'm trying to relay is if your reading reviews, try to focus from people who know these worlds and these characters over people who review almost everything just for the sake of conforming with current movie trends.And onto my quick burst review: As a comic reader myself I've decided to separate the Characters in the Suicide Squad from 'A' rated Superheroes/ Supervillains. You've got to remember that the characters in Suicide Squad are 'B' rated Characters (sometimes even 'C' rated). If you could do that then you will enjoy the movie more. For me it was a terrific ride full of action, a bit of comedy, and with a decent Character background story.The scenery was dark yet luminous which was perfect for this type of movie. All the actors and actresses played their parts quite nicely. From Killer Croc (played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) to Captain Boomerang (played by Jai Courtney), and El Diablo (played by Jay Hernandez). The Enchantress/Witch was supposed to be creepy and mysterious and Cara Delevingne delivered just that! And best of all were Will Smith as Deadshot and Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. You feel for Deadshot because you see what makes him tick and his background story bridges a bit of emotion with captivating intrigue. When it came to Harley Quinn, I didn't see how the Suicide Squad team could have valued anything from Harley Quinn's abilities (but of course they found a way to mix her in with the team). This I base on the type of mission the cast was given to undergo in this movie (I don't want to give any spoilers so you'll have to see the movie to see what I mean). That been said how Margot Robbie portrayed Harley Quinn as the actual standalone Character was done close to perfection! And as a Harley Quinn fan that was good enough for me!I found myself with conflicting viewpoints with Jarod Leto's rendition of the Joker. It almost felt like he tried to mimic and/or add Heath Ledger's Jokers antics into his Joker - for me a tattoo punk/gangster looking Joker to use those Characteristics (if that was the case) didn't really work for me. I can't really say that he was a poor adaptation of the Joker either, but I will say there was a lot of room for improvement - in correlation to the style and type of this Joker they tried to portray in this flick.Final verdict: As mentioned at the beginning of this review, the key point here is if you can recognize that these zany misfits called the Suicide Squad are not classified as 'A' list status Superheroes and should not be compared to them, then it's quite probable that you will enjoy this film, and to be fair that's how this movie should be looked at/reviewed. Would I recommend this movie? Yes I would, especially if you go into the movie not expecting empyrean like Superhero statuses. And finally, I would like to stress that if they decide to develop another installment of Suicide Squad that it really should be an R- rated film. Then it would truly be Suicide Squad personified.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A lot of potential but not quite there yet,Overall this move wasn't my cup of tea. I'm a fan of DC movies (marvel is winning right now) and I can wait for the Wonder Woman movie to come out on DC but this movie didn't fit the bill. The characters were underdeveloped which led to a lack of compassion and compelling moments. Most scenes and overall story line felt rushed and there was no time to learn or understand the characters. The story line was also predictive and stale. I will say that both Harley Quinn and Deadshot were amazing although there was not much time available for the other squad members. To me this felt like a push to help develop the justice league movie but we'll see.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I genuinely have no idea why people like this garbage,"While many people will probably disagree with me I am not changing my opinion that this was the worst film of 2016... by far. Yes it's worse than Nine Lives, Norm of the North and Gods of Egypt. This is mainly due to the fact that it is a confused mess and that is mainly due to the amount of edits and re-edits it has had. Many have said this was a production nightmare with absolutely no control. It is known that there were three main edits that were made for this film. One was approved by the Director (David Ayer), One was edited and approved by a studio that makes movie trailers, and the final edit was a mix of the two previously mentioned. Whoever's decision it was to put the third edit I mentioned in theatres must have been absolutely hammered that day.This particular edit leads to problems that include the worst pacing that a film has ever had, editing that looks dull at points or flashy and tacky the next minute, a first act that feels like a bunch of trailers mix mashed and jammed together (not to mention this is all while three people are eating steak). This combination leads to underdeveloped or non existent character arcs.Even if the editing and pacing were good the movie would still be god awful because the story makes no sense, the plot is beyond predictable and boring, and the characters all grated on my nerves (except deadshot because he was boring).Overall this movie is unbearable for me.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Don't listen to the critics!,"First thing first: don't listen to the critics! Suicide Squad is a really fantastic and well rounded film. The film is thoroughly entertaining and does not disappoint. It has some really impressive action sequences and the writing combines a perfect blend of seriousness and humour.Jared Leto has completely nailed the Joker! The only real problem is that we don't get enough of him. Leto's performance is unlike any Joker we have seen before, acting as more of a crime lord. This is an inspired version of the Joker, one of which I am absolutely desperate to see come up against Ben Affleck's Batman.Harley Quinn portrayed by Margot Robbie is also something I have been waiting to see for a long time. She is the ultimate female bad-ass and at times really steals the whole show. When Harley is on screen with the Joker, magic happens and it is a welcome addition to the cinema screen. I can't wait to see more of this criminal couple.Other characters which are of note are Deadshot who is excellently played by Will Smith and Diablo who is played by Jay Hernandez. These two characters are truly brought to life by these great actors.The film lacks a little something in the antagonist department (a slight irony) but this does not bring the film down as there are such strong characters portrayed by such great actors/actresses. I would have personally loved to have seen Joker as the main antagonist. However, I can respect the choice made.Overall, I think David Ayer did a really fantastic job of bringing this team of colourful characters together. I would give Suicide Squad 7 out of 10 for its bold new take on the superhero genre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Flat Jared Leto in comparison to Heath Ledger,"Jared Leto is flat in comparison to Heath Ledger.Two great actors playing the same character of The Joker. One did not do so well. One did not give the role proper effort.It is quite unfortunate that the late Heath Ledger will never be seen again in any role. But that does not excuse Jarod Leto, a highly skilled actor, from just calling it in. Ledger gave the role a fantastic effort; he won the Oscar posthumously. Leto has also won an Oscar for another role; I know that he is capable.The film itself demonstrated the skill of Margot Robbie for the 1st of so far 3 times in her role as Harley Quinn. Leto did reprise his Joker role in another film; maybe he did better though I did not see the film.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Split between fandom and time.,"I have read the comic's for years and when I saw a movie coming, I can't say I was too positive. Usually when a movie is made from a comic or game or a simple book you have read you will be pi**ed off at all the changes they have made to suit the director and/or actors of the movie. Unfortunately they can't all be made to suit the fans like for example marvels Deadpool.That being said, they did a great job of what they made. Most of these characters are from another time that we know and love, and inserting them in a present day movie is usually hard if not impossible, And for once when making a 2016 version of the same characters they hit bulls-eye. The characters are fun and well made and all but... That is all there is to it.The story-line was paper-thin so the movie felt more like a prelude explaining the characters so they can make a second movie. I would see it again, and probably will, but I'd be more hyped about turning it into a trilogy with the 2th and 3th movie having more of a story-line.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Margot Robbie for President,"The last time a woman wowed me with her bravado was Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver in Kill Bill. Since then no one's even come close until Robbie who is spectacular as the crazed Harley Quinn. Though she's hardly a heroine here, I'd love to see her star in a spin off. Somehow her role gives me inexplicable joy and I was smiling thinking about her a long time after the film was over. What a pleasure! Restores my faith in women! Robbie is wild, gutsy, playful and unforgettable. And pretty much both quirky and gorgeous.Of the rest of the crew I enjoyed the Australian, played by James McGowan, and Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag the most. The story is about their origin as a team. And considering how difficult it must be to bring a comic book to life, I can't help admiring this mostly successful effort.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The best DCU film so far,"After the divisive critical reaction and box office mediocrity of Batman v. Superman, I went into Suicide Squad not expecting much. Surprisingly, I liked a lot about the film. Thankfully, the portentous gods vs men ""do we need heroes?"" waffling from BvS is nowhere to be found.David Ayer knows that action can be fun, as apposed to Zack Snyder's heavy handed growling and yelling matches. And the ""rogues called together to do good"" has echoes of 2014's Guardians of the Galaxy, one of the best MCU films. And the anarchist spirit is a fun break from the somber tone of the previous films, to a point where it starts to feel like it's not actually part of the same universe, despite Ben Affleck showing up as Batman in a cameo.Jared Leto's Joker is a different beast then Heath Ledger's portrayal in The Dark Knight, and in the DC cinematic universe, it works surprisingly well. Picture Hannibal Lector combined with Patrick Bateman. It's a shame there isn't more of him in the film. If they make The Joker the main villain of a Batman film, I'd pay all the money to see that.Margot Robbie is the standout performance of the film, she nailed the character of Harley Quinn perfectly. Will Smith is good, given how little character background he's given. The rest are hit and miss. Crocodile man-monsters, ninjas and pyromaniacs.The negatives? The choppy editing of the first 15 minutes is annoying, the villain is pretty forgettable, the character intros are hit and miss, and the overuse of pop songs gets old fast.

"Jared Leto and Margot Robbie Lift ""Suicide Squad""","The first time I saw ""Suicide Squad"" I found that the focused too much on non-super villain Deadshot, played in the film by Will Smith (""Men in Black""; ""Independence Day""), and missed the mark. However, I saw the film a second time, I found the film better than I remembered.When Jared Leto (Academy Award winner for ""Dallas Buyers Club"") is on screen as the Joker with Harley Quinn, played by Margot Robbie (""The Wolf of Wall Street""), I was captivated. Their scenes are like ""Scarface"" meets ""Romeo & Juliet"" painted in neon carnival colors while sitting on a whirling out-of-control merry-go-round. They may be the most fascinating romantic characters portrayed on film this year, and their performances stayed with me.Writer/Director David Ayer (""Fury"") may have been too tied to the source material, DC Comics ""Legends #3"" graphic novel of the same name that self-consciously tried to humanize lesser known villains. Deadshot's story is mundane in an extraordinary world with a Dark Knight and a Man of Steel, and drags the whole film down.The film includes other lesser known villains, including Amanda Waller, (played by the brilliant Viola Davis of ""The Help""), Katana (played by martial arts star Karen Fukuhara), Boomerang (played by Jai Courtney), and Rick Flag (portrayed by Joel Kinsman). But we don't ever get to know them as characters and do not match the maniacal darkness and glee found in the Joker and Harley. I believe Writer/Director David Ayer, and the producers, could have benefited from a re-write before green-lighting the screenplay to make this film from good to great.The film is helped by good cinematography by Roman Vasyanov (""Fury"") and composer Steven Price (Academy Award winner for ""Gravity""). The soundtrack relies heavily on good 70s rock ballads and hits that tries to keep the film's tempo up.I saw it in 3D and while a few shots were made more interesting, the 3D glasses darkened some scenes so much that I had to remove the glasses to see what was really going on. So, I recommend seeing the film in 2D.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

quite a movie where the villains are actually the heroes...sort of,"Suicide squad was a pretty cool movie,although I was expecting it to be longer than unexpected. I liked how they are all fighting like they're the avengers in all of the fights. That is actually what it reminded me of a little bit ,the 2012 avengers movie. There were a group of individuals fighting an army of unknown creatures together. Although,it wasn't giving a good cooperation so much,it was still giving a little bit of team work. I have to be honest with this,I wasn't a big fan of the joker's look,but I liked everything the joker would be doing. I loved Harley Quinn and what she did,but not the look. I love her old fashioned look better. I love Deadshot,that's not changing. I never really knew about killer Croc a lot or Diablo or Kitana. I knew about Captain boomerang and he was funny. I was actually surprised to see the a few unexpected guests,except for Batman. I knew he was in it,because of the trailer,and plus these are mostly his villains too. So it would make sense to put him in it. I also didn't know about Enchantress that much either. I just knew she was in the movie,but they didn't show her much in the movie. I never really knew who were the bad bad guys in this movie,but I was amazed to who it was. Suicide Squad was a good movie,but it looked like they were rushing into the teamwork a little bit. bUt still,it wasn't that bad.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

awesome squad,"amazing film of 2016,after batman vs superman.soundtrack was awesome.screw critics.Suicide Squad is a great step in the right direction for the DC film universe. It is well worth checking out on the big screen and is right up there as one of my favorite movies for the whole year so far.A fantastic cast, lighthearted tone, and fun soundtrack make Suicide Squad one of the most entertaining films of 2016.""Writer-director David Ayer (End of Watch) skillfully sets up the film, introducing each of the crazies with caffeinated comic-book energy,"" wrote Chris Nashawaty for Entertainment Weekly.""For DC, which blew it with Batman v Superman last spring, Suicide Squad is a small step forward.

Colorless squad in a confusing fast paced conventional adventure,"It is a confusing film, and that is not because it is complex but because it is not well developed. Characters are undeveloped. Image is too dark making harder to understand what is going on, what is worsened by the video clip pace. There are serious problems in edition - a good example is when Harley Quinn is thrown out by nothing as the blow was not against hers. After the so promising ads and trailers, I really expected much more colorful characters. The background of the characters is not carefully explored because they are numerous and the movie is in a hurry; it is only explained (at best; sometimes even this does not happen). Therefore, spectator just sees, does not feel, as there is no time for dramatic impact. Harley Quinn is by far the most interesting character; indeed, I would rather watch a Harley Quinn movie than this film. Deadshot and Rick Flag are the most consistent ones, with the best developed backgrounds, but they are far from being among the nicest characters in DC pantheon, right? Diablo is visually quite nice and becomes more interesting as the story advances, but his drama about using his power does not convince and bores. The Joker is not bad, and his visual is nice (I liked the smile on the hand) but he does not frighten and does not laugh, what is not true to the character (besides that, most of the cut scenes seem to show him and Harley, what is a waste). I saw many people praising Amanda Waller as a great villainess; OK, she does well, but she is not that special either. Killer Croc is visually excellent but is quite unimportant in the film. Enchantress and her brother are not bad and their magic has not been odd inside the story as I was afraid, but a better direction would be required to have them as the really big threats they are supposed to be. Captain Boomerang, Katana and Slipknot are the worst; uninteresting, they are there just to increase the number of members in the crew. The whole melodrama and slow motion in the final battle suck, but the very last three scenes after that are good.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Not the best D.C. film, yet not the worst, it's different and unique hey let the bad guys be the showcase and do the dirty work!","Being a ""Batman"" and D.C. comics fan since I watch all the movies and read the comics the latest entry ""Suicide Squad"" had to be a must see. And this picture is different and unique as anytime you have the villains and the bay guys shining and doing the dirty work it's a showcase, really it's wild, wicked, and fun chaos! The plot is pretty simple Amanda Waller(Viola Davis)heads up a secret government agency and all of a sudden a black ops mission has come up. And the plan is to get a group of super villains to come out of prison and help with the mission, for in return an exchange for all reduced sentences! Yet the job is fun, wild, wicked, and crazy, to watch the bad boys and oh yes bad girl(Harley Quinn)mop up and do the dirty work is pure pleasure! The film has plenty of action and the super villains most remembered are Deadshot(Will Smith)a guy who's lethal with a bullet and the beast and monster of the underground Gotham sewer Killer Croc is a fright of a joy to watch. And the best eye candy treat is the watching of Harley Quinn(in a sexy performance from Margot Robbie)who's a devious girl who swings hard with the big boys and in a subplot her romance with ""The Joker""(Jared Leto)entertains and spices the film it's like a little extra icing on the cake. Overall this D.C. film is different still it's fun watching the bad guys work as deep down they feel some guilt and dream of a normal better life before facing the real picture, ""Suicide Squad"" blends raw aggressive sex appeal with Harley Quinn and the use of ""The Joker"" is somewhat of a wild card still it's a good look at the other side of the D.C. universe that exist showing the different way of life that many live.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Suicide Squad (2016),"Directed by David Ayer. Starring Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Joel Kinnaman, Viola Davis, Jay Hernandez, Jared Leto, Cara Delevingne, Jai Courtney, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Ike Barinholtz, Scott Eastwood, Karen Fukuhara, Adam Beach. (PG-13)Deadshot (Smith), Harley Quinn (Robbie), and a bunch of other nasties with no more than one or two provided character traits are assembled to take down an even nastier entity, an archaeologist (Delevingne) possessed by an evil sorceress; no bets will be taken over whether or not there's a sky-beam during the climax. Ignoring the illogical premise of a team of supervillains being used for dangerous black ops missions, this overstuffed movie can't decide on just about anything: its tone, its visual style, its narrative direction, its very reason for existing. A soundtrack full of pop songs, a series of incoherent fights, and the occasional ""cool guy pose"" and wisecrack does not a good film make. Limp storytelling and erratic action filmmaking is (sadly) almost expected for an enterprise like this, but it's also atrociously conceived and constructed, a blare of chaotic sound mixing and spastic scene transitions that confuses frothing freneticism with heart-pounding excitement. Aside from Robbie, who is just unpredictably zany enough to really wish she and her character were transplanted to a different project, the cast is either completely wasted (Smith, Davis, etc.) or completely misconceived (Leto, Delevingne, etc.). Won an Academy Award for its makeup, which means it has one more Oscar than ""12 Angry Men"" does. Includes a few cameos from actors in their ""Justice League"" roles.23/100",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Harley Quinn was a bit overdone and a little cheesy at moments, but I love Margot, and thought she did pretty bad a!I would have loved for a stronger plot, an r-rating, and a more darker, more believable ""pyschcotic"" character from them, but hey, we can all be directors lolI'm not super disappointed, but man, this movie had way more potential. :(",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

There's a scene where one of the members refers to the Suicide Squad as ""family"", but that's the moment when I said to myself, we were never shown what makes these people feel like family. It's as empty as that Batman V Superman moment when Superman and Batman are suddenly friends because they realize their moms share the same first name.Marvel had another breakaway cult hit called ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", and DC rushed to have one just like it, and they fell short of a James Gunn thrill ride with living, beating heart.It's not bad, but it doesn't rise to ""good"".On the technical side, I see no reason to pay for 3D or IMAX.

suicide squad (2016) – movie review – the wait is over,"I've waited so long for this movie. I actually bought tickets on 7/18 to make sure I could see it on 8/4 in IMAX.I have adored The Joker, in all of his incarnations since I can remember. He's probably my favorite character of all time. I fully admit that I went to see this for The Joker and Harley Quinn's romance. For that alone, it was well worth it. Still, it had a lot more going for it.The film begins when Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) assembles the worst psychotics to take on any non-human threat.One villain, The Enchantress (Cara Delevingne) is a witch unleashed by archaeologist, June Moone. Amanda keeps The Enchantress's heart, which gives her control, until The Enchantress brings her brother back and they begin to take over by turning people into creatures who work for them.We're introduced to most members via backstories. Deadshot (Will Smith) isn't really too bad of a guy. He's a hit-man, who loves his daughter and is captured by Batman because of that love.I adore Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie).I would have watched her backstory with The Joker (Jared Leto) for hours. She, of course,starts as Dr. Harleen Quinzel and The Joker is her patient. She falls for him and even brings him a stuffed animal kitty. He asks her for a small favor. All he wants in the whole world is a machine gun. How could anyone deny him that? So, she like anybody with a heart would,gets him one. He breaks out and gives Quinzel a bit of shock. Later above a vat of chemicals that turned him into the sexy beast he is. She willingly jumps into the vat wanting to be his. The Joker starts to walk away. He's angry at himself for caring about her, but jumps nonetheless. I love them together.As the King of Gotham, if an idiot disrespects his Queen, The Joker obviously has no choice but to kill. He, after all, is still The Joker.He's a sexy, David Bowie/Alice Cooper gorgeous killer who needs his own film with Harley.You can keep THE NOTEBOOK and TITANIC. The Joker and Harley ALWAYS does it for me and the casting here was topnotch.Due to Batman's reckless behavior of jumping on his car, The Joker drives into water and narrowly escapes with his life. Harley is then put in jail.Of course, The Joker isn't going to leave his lady love in prison. He gets a guard to sneak her a phone and texts that he's coming for her.Some are upset that the movie didn't make a love triangle between Deadshot, Harley and The Joker. I'm SO glad they didn't. It isn't only Harley's strength that The Joker likes. It's Harley's complete infatuation and loyalty to him. He created her. They're meant for each other as if her were Adam and she Eve. It's her willingness to throw away her career,jump into a vat and be reborn into Harley that makes him take her.It's her complete and sworn devotion to him that not only he enjoys, but the audience enjoys too. The Joker and Harley are perfect together as is. They should be a duo that rules Gotham together. I'd love them to kill Batman and take over. It's like NATURAL BORN KILLERS and BONNIE & CLYDE, but sexy.By the way, how is there not a Harley & Joker comic? Why isn't there one? MAD LOVE is my favorite. I love the backstory between them. Why aren't they ever allowed a universe where they can create mayhem,screw over Batman and get away with it.I would love to see Harley in a position to continuously save The Joker and vice versa.Now, there were other characters too. Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) is a bad-ass. He lives in water and has the exterior of a Croc. He's strong and doesn't mess around. He was pretty funny and also an intimidating dude.Diablo (Jay Hernandez) is a guy who when pushed to the edge can start fires with his hands. He doesn't like doing it because years ago, he got angry and set a fire that killed everyone in his house.Boomerang (Jai Courtney) is a huge tough guy who loves fighting and throwing his boomerang. He's witty and funny. He definitely has a few shining moments. I wouldn't mind seeing a movie about his character.Amanda puts Rick Flagg (Joel Kinnaman) in charge. He's a soldier who has fallen in love with June Moone and wants to save her from The Enchantress. On his side is Katana (Karen Fukuhara) a woman who traps the souls of her victims in the same sword her husband's soul is trapped in.This was definitely non-stop action. The film was smart enough to divide the time that the Joker was on screen so you never went longer than about 10-15 minutes without seeing him. Jared Leto shines. I knew he would. Ever since I saw the first picture released where everyone was upset about the tattoos, I was like, ""Yep, there's the Joker.""Leto is different than any Joker we have seen in the past. I thought I'd be the only one rooting for him, but I wasn't. Most of the crowd, at the theater, loved him. He's maniacal, crazy and so much cooler than Batman.Many fans of The Joker have stated on message boards that he needed to be in the film more. I can't deny that, but then again it could have been a 12 hour long one-man-show of The Joker and I'd say, ""we need a bit more Joker.""Overall, see this in IMAX. I know I'll see it a few more times before it comes to Blu-ray and then I'll buy the Blu-ray.Kudos all around. Everyone did a really great job.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Fun time with plenty of lols,"I honestly do not understand why this movie got all the bad reviews. Can't understand for the life of me. I guess some people want the DCEU to be more like the MCU? To that I ask,, why?!? I would prefer a difference.Now,, do I have a few complaints about this movie,, well yeah. I do have a few,, but I'll get to that later.This movie introduces us to a lot of characters we haven't seen on the big screen - Deadshot, Harley Quinn, Killer Croc, Diablo, Capt Boomerang, Katana, and the Enchantress. (If any of those characters have been in a live action movie it's news to me) Will Smith kills it as Deadshot (pun intended). I hope he comes back for the 3rd movie. Margot Robbie was obviously born to play the role of Harley Quinn. She just becomes the character. Kinnaman was great as Rick Flagg, and all the other characters were played good as well.Davis as Amanda Waller,,, holy crap!!! (No surprise though,, she is an Oscar winning actress) Like Deadshot says in the movie,, she is just a mean, mean lady. Cold as they come!!Of courrse,, can't leave out Affleck as Batman. He makes a few short appearances. (I was among the group of people who were displeased upon hearing he was cast as Batman in BvS:Dawn of Justice. I did, however, trust Snyder, having seen all of his previous work,, and I was incredibly pleased with Afflecks performance as the Caped Crusader. As a matter of fact,, imo he is the #2 performance of the character(Bale and Keaton are tied for the #1 spot).) Also,, Leto!!! I realize I'm in the minority here,, but I enjoyed Leto's portrayal of Joker,,, and I wanted MORE!!!!!!!!!!For those who expected more of Ledger's portrayal,, what were you thinking?!? Different universe!!! Also,, why would you want the same thing again?!? Leto did a great job of being over the top weird and crazy! I want to see him again,,,Now onto the complaints,, well, like I said, I wanted more of the Joker. Other than that,, there was one scene towards the end where things are going in slow motion. I like that things are building up to a climax in slow motion,,, it was just a little too slow. Needed to be going a lil bit faster than it was.

"Suicide Squad delivers a solid two hours of aesthetically pleasing, superpowered action that's just plain fun to watch.","There are currently two serious, mind-boggling questions that need to be answered. First, why did John Flickster watch Fifty Shades Of Black (2016)? Second, why isn't Justin Bieber on display in some zoo? By the way, I like watching some of John Flickster's movie reviews. He has a good channel. Anyway, I watched Suicide Squad (2016) some time ago, and I was somewhat surprised by it. Warner Bros. Pictures is in the process of creating its own so-called cinematic universe with DC Comics superheroes. This decision was influenced by the money-making success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. So, like any other large entertainment company without an original idea, Warner Bros. Pictures wants to get in on the action. Some people might say that the company is not off to a good start. They're right. But I still like some things in the movies that Warner Bros. Pictures has released so far. These movies are Man Of Steel (2013), Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice (2016) and Suicide Squad (2016). On the one hand, these movies are dumb, unoriginal, violent and depressing pieces of Hollywood garbage. On the other hand, there are some good ideas in these movies. Also, the acting is good in places, the special effects are good, and, for example, the people that worked on hair and make-up for Suicide Squad deserved winning an Oscar. But this is what one would expect from Warner Bros, which is a major Hollywood studio. I mean, you can't expect a movie with a budget of almost $200 million to be garbage on all levels. Still, because of the problems that I've mentioned, I'm not going to go around and say that I like Suicide Squad or Man Of Steel. Seriously, how can you like a movie in which ships look like johnsons? That's really too bad because I like some other things in Man Of Steel, like the special effects and the designs. Unfortunately, I will never say that I like Man Of Steel because it's depressing, because the characters are not interesting, and because Zack Snyder seems to have an obsession with phallus symbolism in all of his movies. Does anyone remember 300, which was released in 2006? Thanks to that movie, we've learned that soldiers in Ancient Greece spent a lot of time working out in American gyms. Maybe the Persians should have bought passes to American gyms too. Suicide Squad is an entertaining movie. I probably enjoyed watching it more than I enjoyed watching Man Of Steel. Still, like Man Of Steel, Suicide Squad is weighed down by some of the same problems, and it is, first of all, a Hollywood product. I feel the same way about Star Wars: Revenge Of The Sith. I remember watching this movie in a theatre. It's when I was still going to high school. I watched it in the same theatre in which I watched Ghost In The Shell 2: Innocence. It was summer. The auditorium was full of people. There were many children. I remember being entertained by Revenge Of The Sith. It was quite a spectacle on the big screen. It's one of my most memorable theatre going experiences. But now, of course, I know that it's not such a good movie. It has some problems, to say the least. Watching it in a theatre, however, was quite something. There have been so many movies about superheroes in the last decade that there have been talks about superhero movie fatigue, as if people are tired of watching movies about superheroes. Well, I certainly don't have this fatigue. Other people don't have this fatigue too because these movies are still very profitable. If they're done well, they will certainly make a lot of money. Though I have the feeling that Hollywood keeps making these movies not just for profits. It seems to me that these movies have a certain social message, especially movies about teams of superheroes. I think that the concept of superheroes and supervillains in Western society goes back to feudalism and to knights. So much Western literature is about super heroes and super villains. So, Sherlock Holmes just had to be a super detective and Professor Moriarty just had to be a super criminal. This concept of individualism is present in the art and literature of few other cultures.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"""Suicide Squad"" feels like DC trying to catch up to Marvel","Marvel has been developing major story lines across multiple arcs for almost 15 years: Spider Man, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, X Men, et al. Now they are developing a new arc on Netflix. Even ""Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."" has the purpose of linking all the arcs. These multiple arcs have established characters and backstories to the point when they can be combined for huge stories (in comic book parlance: Cross over events).DC is late to the game and is using ""Suicide Squad"" to try and reverse engineer the concept. This movie, like ""Batman vs. Superman"" is overloaded with characters and foreshadowing of future stories until it becomes a sort of summary of what we the viewers don't but will need to know. And the truth is, summaries tend to be a bit dull.Fortunately ""Suicide Squad"" has Harley Quinn, probably DC's most unique and in her way, beloved, character. And fortunately Margot Robbie owns the hell out of the role. Harley is complicated and poses profound questions, most significantly; is she bad? Like Spike in ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" she asks us to examine the importance of perspective in determining good from evil.Deadshot (to Harley): ""Stay evil..."". Is she? Does she? What is Harley's motivation for acting as she does at the movie's climax? She's lost Joker and Amanda Waller has no leverage on Harley, so why does Harley....? NO SPOILERS HERE FOLKS. MOVE ALONG.It is hopeful that after ""Suicide Squad"" DC will have established enough backstories with enough viewers (complain all you want, but ""BvS"" and ""Suicide Squad"" have and are being viewed by millions) that they can move forward with more focused stories. Both Wonder Woman and Harley Quinn have their own movies on the way and the ""Easter Eggs"" in ""BvS"" and at the end of ""Suicide Squad"" allude to future Justice League movies. This year's DC offerings have been dark, literally and tonally. But the future could be brighter and a lot more fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
worst dc film,"This movie was an complete and utter disaster. I don't think they could've portrayed each character worse. I love Jared Leto but the fact that he was trying WAY too hard to perfect his joker, ruined it for me. Margot Robbie did what I believe is the best she could with the awful screenplay they were given. For such an important and necessary character like Harley Quinn the way that they wrote her as someone throughout the whole movie was obsessed with some boy destroyed the potential she had. As much as I understand that's her 'thing' to be under the joker's spell, it was too much for the amount of action they tried to pack in. Speaking of action, each supposed 'action' scene was a massive let down. When you're watching these scenes you're supposed to be on the edge of your seat, and aching for the characters that are hit or almost dying, however in 'Suicide Squads' instance I just wanted it to be over. I was so excited to watch this, and it was such a huge let down. 2 hours of your life I'm begging you not to waste, go watch the new 'The Suicide Squad' which I promise you, you don't need to watch this one for, and this 2021 sequel is a great comeback from the let down released in 2016.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Well................ it's worth watching,"When I watched BvS, I thought that was not great for DC but maybe Suicide Squad will make up DC reputation because the trailer was so cool and not typical. I was so excited waiting for this movie, hoping there would be big surprises waiting. It starts with introducing every character, flashbacks, powers, weaknesses. And the first half is solid, I like it. The act is good, especially Robbie, Leto, and Smith, but not so much with Captain Boomerang (which I don't really know what he is doing in this movie). And I like how they throw some jokes in there. But as the movie goes on, it turns out to be typical and a little bit cheesy. Well I don't know what, but it has the same not so good feeling to it like BvS, I call it DC cliché. I guess its the plot, or the weak conflict, or maybe because I put my hopes up too high for this movie, I don't know. The story is too weak for such strong and bad ass characters. Is it worth watching? Yes. Is it good? Yes. Is it good enough for super villain movie? Ummm ... sadly No. Just.... don't put your hopes up too high.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Very interesting,"This movie is a very big relation for DC comic fans when all of gotham's most wanted work together to fight a common enemy of their own reliance.

$175 Million Dollar Fireworks Display,"Even though this film has been out for a few years, I just recently took the time to watch it all the way through. It was a slog but I'm glad I did as I believe there is a lot to be learned from this movie.Suicide Squad stops at nothing to razzle-dazzle the audience with extended scenes of destruction, explosions, gunfire and over-the-top f/x. All this despite having very little heart or anything the audience should connect to or care about. There is no time to get to know a character before we're introduced to yet more supposedly badass characters (all with the hokiest setups) until we (or at least I) barely cared about any single one of them. This is a great example of a movie that overstretches itself with the number of characters but just doesn't deliver the emotional connection that better movies can achieve with just a handful of fleshed-out, well-written characters.The f/x were what you'd expect for a movie with this big of a budget. Some shots I'm sure took many thousands of hours of labor to put together, but at the end of the day they are weightless and forgettable because I was emotionally checked out. I don't mind movies with over the top spectacles of violence and mayhem but they have to serve the story and be meaningful within the context of that narrative. From watching this, it seems the production mindset was more 'just give the people explosions and broad character tropes, they won't taste the difference.'Overall, I did not enjoy this movie but still think it should be understood and learned from. Compare it to the boiled-down, gut-wrenching Joker and wonder how both these movies could be produced by the same company.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Any movie that makes me laugh out loud and watch again-- gets a 10.,"I honestly do not know why so much hate on this film. It astounds me. Is it because it comes from comics and didn't hold up? I don't know. I'm not into the comics and do not normally dig on movies like this. I saw a trailer. It looked interesting and so I gave it a chance.It's campy. Which I like. Lots of movies are campy and popular. Hopefully that isn't the reason for the low score and bad reviews, etc. I don't know.But as a story it is believable (in movie-verse) and compels the viewer to the end.There are some parts/places in the movie that are, indeed, cheesy, but look past and listen to the soundtrack, watch the actors engage and be amazed by the incredible color and imagery of this film.I could have done without Leto's take on the Joker, but it is what it is. I did like the Killer Croc and Harley Quinn characters and feel they steal the scenes they are in. My opinion.It has even amount of suspense, drama, laughs and comics-magic. I encourage you to give it a shot with an open mind.Enjoy~",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Enjoyable, but poor story","The first thought I had as soon as the movie was over was: a lot of flesh and no bones.The acting is great, Margot Robbie is perfect and way out of reach of all the others, Will Smith being Will Smith is good, and Leto had the guts of bringing to us a new Joker (not better than others, just different).The soundtrack is really good. There are some jokes that cracked the theater. I liked the action scenes.All of this is what I call ""Flesh"".What is missing (the ""bones"") is a solid story, in a movie where the main characters are bad guys you need a really good antagonist and the movie fails in that. The movie spends the first part to introduce the characters and jumps directly to the main plot, that is so weak to be confused to a warm up mission.I didn't feel any tension, nor the movie made me care about what was happening on the screen. Yes, great characters, funny, but without a story to support them the risk to be a pointless movie, another expensive set up for the Justice League, is real.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not good,"This is not the worst DC movie, but it is close. A couple of good things Will smith as Deadshot,Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, and Viola Davis as Amanda Waller. Everything else is okay or bad the worst part of this movie is Jared Leto as Joker because he was the worst joker he could have been so much more. The Action is okay. The rest of the sqaud members are genric and useless. The villain Enchantress is Bad and not a good villain i like how she look crepy but that is ruined later she was also pretty Genric for a villain in 2016. This is so bad I think all Phase 4 Mcu movies expect Thor love and Thunder is better than this movie.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""Suicide Squad"" Is As Good As The Actions Of Its Antiheros","""The world changed when Superman flew across the sky... and then it changed again when he didn't"" says Waller at the beginning of the film. Based on the villains from DC comics created by John Ostrander and Len Wein in the early 80's; ""Suicide Squad"" (the most anticipated film of 2016) erects its story after the events witnessed in ""Batman v Superman"" (another of the most awaited of the year). Without the protection of Superman, USA is defenseless with respect to national security, therefore, Amanda Blake Waller ( Viola Davis) - high- ranking American government official and associated of the agency ARGUS - rethinks her project of national protection reforming ones few changes with the purpose of be accepted. Her project is entitled ""Suicide Squad"" and it constitute by highly dangerous criminals imprisoned in a high security prison. It is here where we know to Deadshot (Smith), Harley Quinn (Robbie), Captain Boomerang (Courtney), Killer Croc (Akinnuoye-Agbaje), El Diablo (Hernandez), Sliptknot (Beach). ""You want to put our national security in the hands of witches, gang-bangers and crocodiles?"" asks an official public directly to Waller. This, the only alternative of global salvation for attacking to Enchantress (Delevingne), a powerful witch of black magic that wishes to exterminate the human race with its granitic brother, Incubus.The anomalous dissemination of the film has solidified the expectations of the whole world, the boys most evil and deranged of the planet as heroes, Suggestive? Of course, but as if it were another Hollywood product, so wonder is not relatively true. I am of those who do not see trailers, TV Spots, interviews or ads with products of such great magnitude like this one, so I attended to the movie theater with the naivete of a child small, without consent of its argument but predisposed to amaze me. However, I was also predisposed to bring me a bad taste due to critics reviews published yesterday that I accidentally saw, and the result was a mixture of both presentiments. ""Suicide Squad"" possessed potential and knew take advantage it during certain scenes with certain characters, nevertheless, an unintelligible script, untapped characters and an directing not appropriate for this kind of movies makes it a small step for the DCEU and not the leap to fame of a company that strives to predominate. They had the opportunity on their hands, but some villains snatched them shamelessly.The comic fans/ cinephiles will receive pleasant delights from its screenwriter and director David Ayer, in addition to some cameos (""The Flash"" & ""Batman"" portray to police officers imprisoning to villains, something not very useful for a generic development, except for the arrest of Quinn), the soul and costumes of the characters are chimeric and hilarious. Its soundtrack fits with delicateness and rebellion to the harmony of each scene; Eminem, Rhapsody and Skrillex offer a dark auditive landscape. Ayer also delights to the eye with comic fidelity, nevertheless, the double- edged of this strategy made less than more, basing on several comics, they omit some important information (about the Joker) complicating the creation of a rational and harmonious argument for the film. By the same token, the comical aspect was at the hands of the Harley Q - steals the scenes -, a black humor with Deadshot and crazy humor by the Joker. David Ayer feared to repeat the mistake of Znyder (""BvS"") with ""SQ"", so, he decided to make the so known ""re- shoots"" for fill it of color and visual saturation, however, nor darkness nor the fluorescence has been of the pleasure of critics.Disappointing was to see that Leto's much-vaunted Joker did not form part of the squad and also with all the advertising boom and anticipations did not reach the connection I expected, Yes, he is a worthy successor to Ledger but his scant projected story and his not so majestic appearances placed him in a third plane. More striking and shocking I find to Smith, who, as his character, never wasted a bullet and with Deadshot just dead on target, again. ""SQ"" also lacks of a villain worthy of presence, Delevingne does not convince and was a bad play establish her as the antagonist main, weak point of the script. Robbie is undoubtedly the protagonist of the film, her introduction, her dialogues, her hobbies and her psychotic and brazen way of being ridicule others male villains, Margot steals the credit and we look forward to her solo film with greed.""Suicide Squad"" is Harley Quinn, the Joker, Deadshot, specific scenes of the development and allegorical final scene. We need a sequel, with the same characters, but with a script more lucid and comprehensible, more progress around the other antiheros and a distinct focus, sorrowfully, our villains continue with the bad luck of DC and remain as an excellent summer blockbuster, 2016 has not turning back, but 2017 is coming (""WW"" & ""JL"").",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Heavily OverPromotion of The Joker... You screwed us DC/Warner Bros.,"The movie was meh, so and so.That's not the real thing that bothers me. Actually after this, I don't even care about the movie.WHERE IS THE JOKER ? Where is Jared Leto? Where is all that heavy promotion, hiding him in the trailer just to pop up at the end to get us all excited. All those interviews and stuff. All for nothing, I'll tell ya.DC/Warner Bros. promoted The Joker so much that actually put a thought on people's head (even mine a little bit), that he actually might get close to Heath Ledger's performance.For a year we've been debating, me and my friends with me always insisting that LEDGER IS A GOD for the performance of Joker. And that has been proved now.The Joker has no more than 1-2 minute scenes and all romantic and stuff. That's not what Joker is. Joker is ruthless, psychopath, freaky, schizophrenic... not all this. I LIKED AND ALWAYS WILL LIKE HEATH'S ANARCHIST JOKER <3 <3GO WATCH THE DARK KNIGHT FOR GOODNESS'S SAKE.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fun though a little bit cartoonish,"Likes: Margot Robbie – this film is Margot Robbie's movie. I'm saying this not because I love her but because her character portrayal stood out from the rest. She is the humor of the film and literally the craziest character and the loveliest at the same time.Camera Works – David Ayer sure knows how to take beautiful shots. I'm a little bit partial to the movie's cinematography but the shots were great.Plot – I'm not a big fan of the ""questionable"" plot with no real motivation from most of its characters but I took it as it is. It's plain and simple. No complications and not hard to understand.Viola Davis – you will hate her but you will love her at the same time that you might find yourself rooting for her over the ""bad guys"" and then you'll hate her again. That's how good she is.Dislikes: Execution – this could've been executed better. Yes, David Ayer took beautiful shots but his direction is not cohesive. Flashback scenes are needed but they tend to be anti-climactic. There are also scenes that for me are a little bit unfocused to what should be really going on. There are also several scenes that I find a little bit cartoon-ish.Central Character – I believe that Deadshot should really be the lead but Will Smith's portrayal is a little bit out there. His characterization is kind of corny. I can say easily that Harley Quinn stole every scene she's in.Cara Delevingne – I love her as a top model but she's still too ""young"" to be a full-pledge actress. Blank eyes and unbelievable emotions made me cringe a bit. But she's getting there, I hope.Jared Leto – yes, he's not Heath Ledger but I can't help comparing them together. Both are Oscar winners but unfortunately, Jared can't pull off Joker (yet). I believe that he's a method actor but it didn't work in this movie. I can still see Jared Leto acting unlike Heath who lost into the character itself. For me, that's the difference – one is acting as Joker while the other IS Joker.Over All Impression: Well, I have to say that apart from the poor execution and direction of the movie and contrary to some (or most) of the critics Suicide Squad is good. Good thing they did re-shoots to bring in more humor in the film after BvS was heavily criticized for being boringly serious and laughable in a bad way. DC made the right move to ""copy"" Marvel movies though they might have overdone the humor in some parts.Suicide Squad is a psychedelic mixture of quirky (though some are forgettable) characters that surprisingly worked well for the total cinematic experience. It's a good introduction to a franchise with great potential. I would surely love to see a Suicide Squad vs Justice League movie in the future.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Suicide Squad Review!,"The Suicide Squad was released and is among us. Bringing a lot of expectation and pressure on his back, suicide squad is a movie with a simple story, with interesting characters (however complicated of working in a group), with a tone more fun - fun, the movie actually comes with the order to entertain And enjoy the viewer - and who's not afraid to use a lot of pop songs, really many, to tell his story.Straight out the movie's just throwing everything I saw in the trailers (except what was cut off, he has several things that have been cut off), since beginning got a great sense of humor and action, always accompanied by music. In the meantime, a little bit of wind-up or complexity would have made the most remarkable experience. Maybe, a road map and a more elaborate assembly (a problem of the film, he stays without timing sometimes because of her) that helped this script would have brought us a long more complete. There are reports that the script was written in just 6 weeks, what's a little obvious by the presence of a few clichés and simple solutions of script.However, all who are or have been to the movies, they want to see the squad. Well, all the characters are really very well, some have more emphasis (Harley Quinn and Deadshot), other grow during the long (El Diablo), others lose a little bit of space in the movie and some are lost - the case of Enchantress, she It is well presented, but when the film starts to walk, she don't follow.In the case of the cameos. Batman was only used to boost the squad, both in history as in marketing. And the Joker of Jared Leto? You could say that it was a cameo, maybe he's 15 minutes of screen, only used as a tool of script in the history of Harley Quinn, the clown it was character that had more outtakes - Leto said you could make a movie of the joker With the recorded material -, the film was the squad, but the marketing was abusive on top of it. But, let's wait for more.In conclusion, suicide squad is a movie a lot of fun, which could have renewed the sub-genre (""heroes"") and broken paradigms, unfortunately didn't make it. Go check out simply you can see the Harley Quinn, Deadshot, etc, in action with an incredible soundtrack, you don't have what to say.It's hard to even give a note to the movie, because I had a great time, but taking to the technical side, is flawed. So, I think 6,7,8... Maybe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It was OK but I Wish It was Gr8. DC I expect Better!,"Harley, Croc & Lawton were really good. Really wish there was a Croc vs. Batman fight scene flashback like an epic waterwheel fight perhaps with Croc falling off a waterfall n disappearing & so ending up in an ARGUS prison cell.Arrow/Flash did Amanda Waller, Katana & Captain Boomerang better I think. Still wondering why they even used Captain Boomerang. Really did not add to the plot when u have a major hit man like Dead Shot in the mix. Clock King would've been more interesting and u could have done a bit more interesting tech stuff to wow us tech geeks in the audience. Really did not care for the portrayal of the Joker. Too much gangsta - I mean bling and gold teeth? REALLY?!! He just didn't seem like the ultimate Batman arch nemesis.Would've appreciated a more Mission Impossible feel rather than such a CG rich movie - just didn't feel like a Suicide Squad sort of Mission. I kept thinking Batman or Flash should be showing up to save the day from worldwide epic doom.#SuicideSquad #IamaDCFangirl #DCIexpectbetterofyou",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Another wasted potential,"In the long line of lackluster films comes this joyless cash grab. A weak plot and mostly unloveable characters drags out this two hour charade. It is flanked by an emaciated Jared Leto as the Joker and Robie Margot as Harley Quinn, a woman suffering from Stockholm syndrome. The movie seemed to serve one purpose: the excuse for every crazy ex-girlfriend to dress up with pigtails and sport a baseball bat.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Great and terrible at once,"This movie is really frustrating because it had serious tone issues and plot issues that distract from a great movie. When it's good it's amazing but every time I got on board there would be weird editing or such that distracts. I don't want to say the people who liked the movie were wrong because it is fun and does have a dark vibe to it that are great. On the other hand, David Ayer was made a dark movie which was then mixed with the studio throwing in more Guardian style scenes. I like both styles, just not together. It tries too hard to be Guardians, even using a song used in Guardians, to the point where it doesn't have a focus. A lot of scenes were edited a little too quickly and felt out of place. I think if this movie were edited right, it would be amazing. The entire squad, Harley and Deadshot, is charismatic, likable and has a story with individual traits. If you go in looking for that and fun action, you'll be pleasantly surprised.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

This is a worthwhile addition to the super hero genre that I really enjoyed,"Suicide Squad (2016) is a movie I saw upon its release in the theatres and about 10 times since. The storyline focuses on a group of DC Comic villains currently serving life in jail. When an evil of sorts puts the world at risk, the federal government comes up with an idea to release the super villains as long as they agree to stop the world conqueror. Will the villains keep their word? This movie is directed by David Ayer (Fury) and stars Will Smith (Bad Boys), Margot Robbie (The Wolf of Wall Street), Viola Davis (The Help), Jared Leto (Requiem for a Dream) and Bambadjan Bamba (Black Panther). The storyline for this is very mediocre, as is the conclusion and villain; however, the characters, dialogue and acting is excellent and so much fun. I loved the chemistry between the cast members. The action scenes and depiction of the super powers is very well done. This definitely needed more Joker in the storyline, plot and overall film direction. I am one of the few that enjoyed Leto's performance. Overall, this is a worthwhile addition to the super hero genre that I really enjoyed. I'd score this an 8.5-9/10 based on an excellent soundtrack and entertainment value.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
