A second adaptation of the book that is almost as good as the first,"Not quite in the top 5 of David Fincher's best films ('Se7en', 'The Social Network', 'Fight Club', 'Gone Girl' and 'Zodiac') but it does come close. And this is somebody who found a lot to like about all his films, including his lesser ones like 'Alien 3' and 'Panic Room'.Despite being often considered a remake, personally prefer to call it a second adaptation of the book. The book is a fantastic read, and as an adaptation while it is condensed and has some changes Fincher's film still adheres to the basic tone of the book as does the Swedish version. Of the two versions, the Swedish version just gets the edge for its incredible atmosphere complete with bleakness, chills, shocks and is more authentic, with Noomi Rapace burning the screen enigmatically with her presence.Where Fincher's film improves over the previous version are in four areas. One is the production values, which are far more audacious here. The cinematography, both bleakly moody and exquisite to look at, is more cinematic and perfectly captures the frozen landscape which is like a character in itself. The film is very tightly edited too in a way that is distinctively Fincher. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' music score is another winner of theirs, it is haunting and gives a really unnerving vibe, combined with some clever sound mixing. The script, even when condensed, is more polished and tighter and also has more flow. While Lisbeth is a fascinating and complex character in the Swedish film, the Lisbeth in Fincher's film has even more complexity and more variation of emotions.Fincher's direction is exemplary, showing a mastery of visual style and mood setting, ensuring that the film stays intriguing throughout the length. In lesser hands and with less assured pacing, with the long running time 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' could have been a long haul but had plenty of intrigue. Much of the storytelling is gripping, and while not as authentic or quite as masterful in atmosphere like the Swedish counterpart was it has its fair share of chills, twists and turns (without being convoluted or illogical) and shock value as well as a murky bleakness. Contrary to what some believe, this second adaptation did have point (was fearing it wouldn't), as it made the story more accessible and gave it more exposure.Good acting helps. Daniel Craig is very wisely restrained, the character should have a quiet determination and dignity which Craig handles very well. Christopher Plummer is simply terrific as well, one of his best performances in recent years, while Stellan Skasgard is frighteningly demented and Yorick van Wageningen is unsettlingly sadistic. Robin Wright does her best with a shallow character. Best of all is a magnificent Rooney Mara, such a multi-layered performance and sees Mara not just playing the role but disappearing into it. See her appearance for example, so committed that when you see her in other films you would not believe that it's the same person.There are faults however. Did not think much of the Gothic James Bond-like opening sequence that just felt jarring and out of place. Nor with the accents, which were a mix for some of the actors of having one too heavy or thick (Wright) or not attempting one at all (Craig). The decision to use both English and Swedish in some scenes did have a tendency to confuse, while the central relationship (mostly successfully done) did feel underdeveloped and, even for characters that are the heart of the story, takes over the story a little too much somewhat.All in all, almost as good as the Swedish version and better than both of that film's heavily flawed but still worthy sequels. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Despite claims to the contrary, a necessary re-interpretation of the story","After the announcement that The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was getting an English-language film treatment, I decided that the hype had built up to a point where I just had to read the source material for myself. Though it is not without flaws, Dragon Tattoo is an excellent story with the important mission of raising awareness concerning violence against women. Mere days after finishing the book I watched the Swedish film. The hype train had me excited for an outstanding thriller.The hype train let me down.I was left cold and somewhat irritated by the Swedish adaptation. A ton of important plot elements were left out, some were inexplicably added (Blomkvist's memories of the island became far too important and contrived), and Rapace felt all wrong as Lisbeth. She was brilliant and violent, but lacked the quiet pensiveness of the original character. She did not come off as autistic and emotionally disturbed, just bratty and rude. Worst of all, I was constantly confused by the extremely rushed, strange new take on the story.As a lover of foreign films, I normally grind my teeth when I hear that America is developing a remake. However, I found myself desperate for this one. I needed a movie that actually gave me the experience of reading the book for the first time, that made me care for Lisbeth and that truly disturbed me. Thankfully, the American adaptation (not a remake) delivered exactly what I was looking for. Those who say this version is unnecessary or a rehash must have seen a very different Swedish Girl with the Dragon Tattoo than I saw. The American take is jam-packed with scenes that were either skimmed or completely left out of the Swedish version. Yet, despite being more robust, the English- language Dragon Tattoo is incredibly paced, feeling less rushed yet hitting all the important plot points. The characters have time to develop and grow on you, the clue-finding makes more sense, and the killer is more horrifying. Screenwriter Zaillian knows exactly what to leave out and what to change (though the ending, which mirrors the book's ending, could have been arranged better). Craig, Mara, and even Plummer are spot-on in their roles and feel more fleshed-out as characters. Mara, in particular, inhabits Larsson's Lisbeth in a way Rapace did not. She captures Lisbeth's silent, borderline-autistic nature perfectly. Her fragile body and alien appearance even match the book's description. She allows herself to be vulnerable, but clearly regrets it over time. It's a captivating performance.If someone were to ask me, personally, which version to see, I would have to say without hesitation that this is the rare occasion where the American adaptation is superior. I did not think it was possible to stay so true to the story under three hours.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Not sure which is better...,I liked both the Swedish version and the US version...I think both are great in their own right. Mara and Craig bring a very interesting chemistry to this version that I really enjoyed. The noir-esque feel of the film is really cool. The soundtrack is killer (Trent Reznor)! Worth a watch if you haven't seen it already,9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Quick Comparison of both versions - both excellent in their own right,"Here is a rundown of the differences in the two movies:-MIKAEL BLOMKVIST-American - Blomkvist is played as more of a tough guy and not a good guy. His flaws are laid bare and he shows himself to be much more detached than emotional.Swedish - This is the ""good guy"" side of Mikael. He is sensitive, caring, and smart. He shows a protective side when it comes to Lisbeth. Physically speaking the Swedish Blomkvist doesn't look as sturdy as his American counterpart. He has a gut and appears to be quite a bit older than Lisbeth which can make the relationship between them more shudder inducing and probably accounts for why there are fewer sex scenes between them in the Swedish version.-LISBETH SALANDER-American - Perhaps because Blomkvist was made into such a strong character Lisbeth was then morphed into a more withdrawn and vulnerable girl so as to complement the new Blomkvist. She still has attitude, aggression, and rage but she also exhibits a quiet shy side that was not in the original as well as more of a romantic side.Swedish - In this version Lisbeth is not shy, not gentle, and not nice. She doesn't chase Blomkvist - he chases her. She perfectly embodies everything you think of when you think of a strong female lead and has an unpredictability and edge to her that is exciting to watch. Her dragon tattoo is much, much better.-OVERALL-I liked the American Mikael and the Swedish Lisbeth.While I may prefer a scene or two from the Swedish version, such as the ending, overall I enjoyed the American version more.On the flip side, I can understand why some may hate this version because Lisbeth was their favorite character and she's been changed into something they don't like. For me, the modifications to Lisbeth's character weren't severe enough to put me off.The Swedish version captured a cult following for a reason and I would recommend both to anyone who has an interest in darker gritty movies that have a raw intensity to them. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo isn't for the faint of heart and that's what I love about it!",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo: Another Winner From David Fincher!,"The lights dim, the movie begins with a brief prologue, and the zany and incredibly weird opening credits begin, set to a creepy cover of Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song."" From the beginning, we are in for a wild ride as Stieg Larsson's incredibly popular novel ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is brought to life on screen.Scorned journalist Mikael Blomkvist is called upon by Henrik Vanger, a very wealthy man, while writing a book. Vanger is in search of an answer to the disappearance of his niece, Harriet, which occurred over 40 years ago. He assumes that Harriet is dead, and that she was murdered. He looks to Mikael to investigate her disappearance and who killed her. Then Mikael gets assistance from Lisbeth Salander, a dangerous but intelligent 24 year-old punk who is an accomplished computer hacker and a great contribution to the solving of other crimes. Together, Mikael and Lisbeth go on a dark, eerie journey into a world of crime, Nazism, and corruption that will lead them to Harriet's assassin.I walked into ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" with almost no knowledge of Larsson's novel or the Swedish film made a few years before David Fincher's version. The end result is ultimately an extremely satisfying, brutal, and complex thriller thanks to great direction by Fincher (known greatly for his work on ""Seven,"" ""The Game,"" and ""The Social Network""), excellent writing, and an impeccably chosen cast.After only a few years, the character of Lisbeth Salander has become an attention-grabbing heroine that is as iconic as Edward Cullen of the love-it-or-hate-it ""Twilight"" series. And we can understand why. After all the truly awful and hideous things that have plagued her life, Lisbeth doesn't take any crap from anybody. She may be angry, violent, overtly sexual, demanding, and perhaps a little crazy, but she is a genius at what she does, and has reasons for all of her actions, no matter how gruesome they may be.The mystery surrounding the film is sophisticated and white-knuckling, adding to the intensity and mood of the story and its characters. We're not sure of who is Harriet's killer, or if Harriet is even dead, until the last half hour of the film, and when we do find out the twist, it leaves a stupendous impact.After cementing his reputation in brutal crime thrillers, and surprising us with ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" and ""The Social Network,"" David Fincher was the right man for the director's chair. Every film he makes, even a drama like ""The Social Network,"" sets up a tone of genuine suspense, tension, and fear for the characters. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" isn't any different as Fincher adds his signature touch to the movie.Of all of the people they could have chosen to play these roles, the casting director landed in a pot of gold. Daniel Craig does a wonderful job as Mikael, showing us that he can play characters other than James Bond. With the amount of screen time she has, Robin Wright is also very good as Blomkvist's business partner Erika Berger. Christopher Plummer and Stellan Skarsgård also turn in great performances as Henrik Vanger and Martin Vanger.The person to really watch out for, however, is Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander. Getting her big break in the underrated remake of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and later starring in Fincher's previous film ""The Social Network"" (giving a dynamite performance in the opening scene), Mara has sealed her future with many more promising and exciting roles because of her portrayal of Lisbeth. This is not an easy role to play, knowing that Mara is the second person to play the character. She must endure two shocking rape scenes and a torture sequence, and there is a hefty amount of nudity involved. Mara embodies Lisbeth, immediately bringing immense intimidation, danger, and fury every time she comes on to the screen. Her eyes are wide and emotionless, almost as if you can see right through her. And with everything that has happened to the character, we understand that Lisbeth has a right to be that way. She may be smart, but she is not interested in attraction or friendships with another human being. Overall, Mara gives a sensational, fearless, dedicated, and electrifying performance that guarantees an Oscar nod.Being released during the cheery time of the holidays, ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is not a feel-good film, by any means. It is a harsh, gritty, and rough cinema trip that answers the question of leaving the kids at home with the babysitter. Also, if you're squeamish, you will not like it. However, those who have read the book, and those who have not read it, should check it out. Even without having read Larsson's novel, I left the theater completely satisfied. It is a movie experience that you don't commonly get. Fincher has done it again. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is a must!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"The best adaptation imaginable with an intoxicating, Oscar-worthy performance from Rooney Mara","Chilling, haunting and relentlessly thrilling, director David Fincher has created the definitive film adaptation of Larssons best seller whilst at the same time improving on the source material. A brilliant performance from Rooney Mara only elevates the film to greater heightsThe Review:Ill cut to the chase: this is everything fans of the books could have hoped for, its miles better than the already good Swedish film, its more faithful to the novel, in some places it actually improves on the source material.With ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" David Fincher has put his trademark darkness to fantastic use. Whether its sweeping shots of freezing, snow covered Sweden or wonderfully eerie interiors Fincher creates an unsettling atmosphere that is unrelenting and technically perfect. With Fincher i've learnt to expect a beautifully shot film and this is no exception, within this film are some of his greatest images. Regarding the disturbing nature of some scenes, Fincher is wise enough to show them in all their horror but doesn't stop to linger or exploit.The performances are perfect all round, Its clear Fincher and the casting production went to great lengths to pick not only great actors but those who embody the very essence of their characters. Of note in the supporting characters are Yorick van Wageningen who plays the sadistic Bjurman with unsettling believability and the always great Christopher plummer who is note-perfect as the desperate, loney grandfather Henrik .- As one part of our central duo Daniel Craig puts in his finest performance, normally cast as the tough hero Craig is more subdued here, he has Blomkvist easy charm down to a T but also captures the weak, submissive aspect of his character. - Lisbeth Salander is a character unlike anything fiction has ever seen.broken,pierced, clade in leather with short black hair and a body so slight the wind could break her, she is horribly victimised but refuses to be one. To sum it up she is one of the most interesting and difficult characters an actress could ever play. I could honestly write a whole review on the brilliance of Rooney Mara's performance, she is the very essence of Lisbethas if the character just walked off the page. Mara commands every scene with a mixture of silent burning rage and a deep rooted venerability. Her eyes are the heart of the film, her reactions are the reason myself and the others around me laughed, gasped and even cried. The character requires an actress who can internalize her emotions yet at the same time convay a wide range of feelings. Mara does this such perfect skill, every glance is charged with deep feeling as if you're looking directly into her soul. A brave performance, Mara bares all in the nude scenes and goes to frankly horribly dark places in the now informous scenes of sexual violence. Watching Rooney Mara is witnessing the birth of a star, this is the best performance of the year and if the Oscars fail to reconzie her i will lose all hope in their judgment.The score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is perfect, eerie and unsettling. It is as good as their Oscar winning score last year if not better, its more understated and does what every score should do....improves the scenes not overpower them.This is by and large a perfect adaptation, my main issue lay with one singe sequence. There is a shot that seems to be there solely for the purpose of showing off, it serves no real purpose within the story.The most touching scenes of the film come from the characters themselves, this is a character driven story and none are more powerful than Lisbeth and Mikeal themselves. Fincher makes their relationship the focus and it pays off, they are the heart of the books and Fincher rightfully recognises this.Proving that sometimes ""american"" adaptations can actually be for the better this is a film nobody should miss...its everything the novel is, plus some. More than anything i was impressed by the humour that is added through-out, this film will make you laugh, it will break your heart and it will make you want to take a shower.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"My Review For ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo""","I was really looking forward to The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo ever since I learned that David Fincher had been attached to it. Now normally I'd be angry at the fact of a foreign film being remade, having seen and loved the Swedish version of the film, but I made an exception with this one because of the cast and crew for this film. Fincher, who directed films such as Fight Club, The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, and most recently The Social Network (my favorite film of 2010 and what I thought should have won over The King's Speech), has a fantastic eye for filmmaking and has always impressed me with his movies, save for Se7en which I wasn't as huge a fan of as everyone else was and even on that film I enjoyed a good bit. You throw in the writer of Schindler's List and Gangs Of New York, add actors like Daniel Craig, Rooney Mara, Christopher Plummer and so many others, a score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (who also scored The Social Network), and base it off the best selling book by Stieg Larsson (that's right, this isn't a remake but rather a re-adaptation), it all equals out to, in my opinion, the best film of the year by far.Now the first thing I want to say about this movie is Rooney Mara's performance. She knocks it out of the park portraying Lisbeth Salander. She captured the mystery, the strangeness, the darkness, the out-of-the- norm personality that this character had. She was absolutely fantastic and I'm gonna be shocked as hell if she does not get an Oscar nomination. And she really makes you feel for her in the darker parts of this movie, which we'll get to in a moment. And all the other performances are great as well. Daniel Craig is great as usual and there is great chemistry between him and Mara. Christopher Plummer, as little as he's in the movie, does a great job as well, in fact all the actors do. This is a really well acted movie.Another thing that a lot of people have been talking about with this film, as it was with the book and the Swedish film, was the moments where sexual violence appears on screen. And while there are some really uncomfortable moments in the film, that's the reason why these scenes succeed. They shock you and make you want to look away. And that's good, especially when the themes of this movie as well as the source material were about this sort of thing, and the movie conveys it perfectly. And while these scenes do linger in your mind, they never distract you from the basis of this movie, which leads into my next praise for the film.The story is really engaging. Even though I had seen the Swedish movie and knew how the story as a whole was going to play out, I was able to be really engaged in the movie and not focus on other things. It really sucks you in, and Steve Zaillian, the writer of this movie, structures the film in a way that is both similar and different to the Swedish version, therefore doing what I hoped this film would do, which was taking something that I already knew about and had watched before and made it to where it was still interesting and there were changes made to where I didn't know how it was going to turn out. And that's great.And everything technical about this movie succeeds. The score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is fantastic and really sucks you into the tone of the picture. Jeff Cronenweth, who worked with Fincher on both Fight Club and The Social Network, delivers fantastic cinematography. The editing, the direction, the shots, everything about this movie succeeds, making it a near perfect film.Now one small complaint I have about this film stems a little bit from me viewing the Swedish version, in which they reveal a little more about who Lisbeth is and one of the things she did in her past that made it so troubled. And they didn't use that here which kind of threw me off a little. However, the more I think about it, the less it becomes a concern because 1.) You can't compare the two films and 2.) there are bits and pieces shown in the films climax that shows that Lisbeth deep down does have a soul. So the movie manages to overcome that obstacle, and overall, I have nothing to say bad about it.Overall, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is a masterful film, it's one that you should definitely check out and I'll definitely be checking it out sometime soon. It's directed, written, and acted well, and succeeds in all that it sets out to do. You feel the emotion and darkness of the film, Rooney Mara blew me away with her performance (and that body, damn), and overall it lived up to my expectations. So out of ten, I got to be honest, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is a 10. Go see this movie NOW.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Comes forth with the Thaw,"Greetings again from the darkness. The character of Lisbeth Salander absolutely fascinates me. That's true whether we are discussing Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy novels, the Swedish film versions, or this latest film version from director David Fincher and a screenplay from Steve Zaillian. It's also true whether Lisbeth is played on screen by Noomi Rapace (Swedish films) or Rooney Mara. She is a brilliant character hiding in plain sight from a world that has fiercely mistreated her, and now misjudges and underestimates her. She is the oddest heroine I can recall ... and I can't get enough of her.Let's start with the source material. Stieg Larsson's books are far from perfect, but addictive just the same. The first book (on which this film is based) is, at its core, a simple who-dunnit presented in a manner that is claustrophobic, paranoid and eerie. Moving on to this particular film, we find the director and screenplay holding the basic tone while making a few changes ... some minor, others more substantial. These changes may irk those fans who are a bit more loyal to the books, but Fincher surely wanted to offer more than a simple re-telling of the story.Daniel Craig plays Mikael Blomkvist, the journalist hired to solve the 40 year old mystery of the disappearance/murder of Harriet Vanger, niece to Swedish millionaire Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer). To research, Blomkvist must dig into the Vanger's rotten family tree of Nazis, anti-Semites, sexual predators, anti-social fanatics, and a few just plain loony birds. You can imagine how excited this rich and once powerful family is to have someone uncovering long buried secrets. Circumstances allow for Lisbeth to assist Blomkvist in researching this.Unlike many mysteries where assembling the clues is the most fun, the real heart of this story is the odd, somewhat uncomfortable developing relationship between Blomkvist and Lisbeth. This latest version allows this to develop relatively smoothly, but it nonetheless rattles our senses. We see the subtle changes in Lisbeth as she slowly opens up to the idea of a real friendship based on trust. Fear not mystery fans, the Vanger clan still provides more than enough juice to keep any film sleuth happy.It's truly impossible to avoid comparisons between the two movie versions and the respective casts. It's quite obvious Mr. Fincher was working with a substantially greater budget than Niels Arden Opler had for the first Swedish film. While they are both enthralling, I actually lean a bit towards the rawer original. That takes nothing away from this latest version. Same with Noomi Rapace vs. Rooney Mara. Ms. Mara is excellent in her performance and I was fully satisfied, but Ms. Rapace brought a rougher edge to the role ... one that made it even tougher to crack that shell. The biggest difference in the casts is Daniel Craig against Michael Nyqvist. Mr. Craig is just a bit too cool for the role, while Nyqvist captured the insecurity and vulnerability that Larsson wrote about.All of that is nit-picking. Both film versions are sterling entertainment and hopefully the Fincher version will bring the story to a much wider audience. I would encourage those that are interested to check out the Swedish version, as well as the Larsson books. Maybe that will explain my fascination with this creature known as Lisbeth Salander.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A superb and chilling thriller,"I've never read Stieg Larsson's millennium novels, so I can't say how  faithful this film is to the original material, but I am a big fan of  the Swedish adaptation by Danish filmmaker Niels Arden Oplev. Now, I  know the fact that Hollywood is obsessed with remakes annoys the hell  out of us, but I think there can always be room for different  interpretation, different vision and approach and that's what David  Fincher's version excels in. It's more detailed, more curious, and more  unafraid. It's a superb and chilling thriller with an astounding  performance by Rooney Mara. Whether or not this version is better can  be argued but it certainly is a solid film   Rooney Mara, with her skinny body and goth hairstyle and excessive  piercings and tattoos and her attitude, I think Mara manages to give a  more complex Lisbeth Salander than Noomi Rapace's portrayal. But it's  mostly thanks to screenwriter Steven Zaillian who covers information  that the previous adaptation would simply skim or just talk about  instead of exposing it. Fincher and Zaillian want to seriously show how  dark, troubled, but motivated Lisbeth is. And some may consider this  approach to be too brutal or unnecessary but I think it's no more  brutal than Fincher's previous thrillers like Se7en. This is after all,  in its essence, a movie made solely for Fincher's fans or those who are  comfortable with his style. Jeff Cronenweth's cinematography work is  fantastic by the way, it plays on how much you can handle. It goes  along with the script that tends to be explanatory. Whatever loopholes  or gaps that the previous adaptation had, Fincher's film fills it and  explains it in its own way.  Lisbeth Salander to me is a rebel, she lives by her own rules, but  she's also by herself, this version wants to instill in her mind the  idea that perhaps she could be sociable or she could be considered  normal if she just gets that attention that she never did, and that's  what warrants a different ending. Mara is absolutely phenomenal as  Lisbeth, it's a defining role for Mara, she's made it her own. She's  fierce, highly driven, but there's a sense of innocence to her as well.  She thinks her anger and actions are justified and the film  successfully encourages us to agree.  All those tattoos and piercings are like 'keep off' or 'stay away'  sign, perhaps because of years of rough background, going from one  guardian to another, so when somebody genuine like Mikael Blomkvist  (Daniel Craig) comes along, he represents the safety that desperately  longs for but would never admit to. I think it's smart that Fincher and  Zailian shows the estranged family side of Blomkvist, they see it as  important for Blomkvist to be able to relate to Henrik Vanger's  (Christopher Plummer) dilemma and I think that's a smart move. Craig is  the weakest link because his accent keeps going on and off, I'm not  sure if he even tries to sound Swedish at all, it's quite the  distraction. But he works with what's given to him, keep in mind that  the title is not Blomkvist with the dragon tattoo.  Of course nowadays you can't talk about Fincher's movies without  talking a bit about the unconventional score by Oscar winners Atticus  Ross and Nine Inch Nail's Trent Reznor. In fact, the movie pays an  amusing homage to NIN. Those of you film score aficionados would  probably find Ross and Reznor's tunes for this film rather eerie and  chilling, which it then pretty much serve its purpose. Having said  that, at times I find the score a bit forceful and it's like the same  soundwave echoing over and over again with the intent to hypnotize. I  don't think the opening graphic credit is all that impressive, it's an  interesting take but it looks out of place, it looks like it should be  a separate music video and it doesn't necessarily introduce the tone of  the film that you're about to see.  THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is definitely not a movie for the faint  of heart, it's a movie that would rattle your comfort cage, and I think  audiences will be divided, you'll either truly love it, or truly detest  it, but there will hardly be a middle ground.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Let's Focus on the Film at Hand,"Unlike seemingly almost every reviewer here, I did not read the book nor did I see the original filmed version of this story. Even if I had, I still prefer, as always, to view/review this film as a unique, individual work of art and not compare it to other works of art.So, to that end I found this film to be heavy on style and a bit light on substance. The score was solid and very effective. On the other hand, Rooney's character Lisbeth was for me not really a fully developed character. I bit more back story on her could have gone a long way I think to transforming her from a one dimensional person with lots of tattoos and piercings into a someone the viewer could take a greater interest in. Craig is fine and completely adequate. Despite some shortcomings i do think there is enough here to check out for those curious who have still not seen it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Great movie that more than well lives up to the book!,"I have read all three of Stieg Larsson's books and seen the Swedish movies. The Swedish version of The girl with the dragon tattoo(Män som hatar kvinnor) was very good but I feel it is somewhat overrated. Nothing particularly weak about it but still not as good as some claim. When word came about that David Fincher would direct the new one I was just overjoyed. My maybe favourite director working right now filming one of the best books I had read in years. With thrillers like Se7en and Zodiac to his credit he was the perfect choice. And he doesn't disappoint.The big question for many have been will Rooney Mara live up to Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander? The answer is She does! Who is better is difficult to say because they actually play the character quite different. Noomi is older and seems more secure and determined character while Mara feels more fragile and emotional. I feel Mara is more like how Lisbeth is described in the book. I like this movie better but regarding Lisbeth Salander it's a draw. Daniel Craig is great as Blomkvist, and it's good that even if he is a big star(James Bond) he plays the role really down to earth, the person the character should be. It is and should be Salander who is the main one and he lets Mara be the star. One actor who really surpasses his predecessor is Stellan Skarsgård. Considering his character has such a big role this is a big plus for the American version. Christopher Plummer should also be mentioned. As I'm now on the actors I should also mention the relation between Salander and Blomkvist. Craig and Mara are brilliant at creating chemistry. Not only does one focus on the mystery but at the end maybe even more about them. Do they really speak with a Swedish accent? Some of them yes and I admit it felt a bit strange a first but one gets used to it like with most other things so some time later in the movie I didn't mind anymore.Steven Zaillian deserves praise for the script. The original movie, even though it was not much shorter the plot at times felt rushed. Especially the ending where it went so quick and simplified. Zaillian succeeds in fitting the story without making it to fast or simple. Even if one hasn't read the book you can follow what is going on. Very impressive and perhaps what lifted this movie above the Swedish. So there are some changes but for me, unlike how some feel about adaptations, the book isn't something holy and changes don't have to be wrong. Stieg Larsson's novel was not without flaws and the changes they made make sense, necessary and some better. Fincher is a master of suspense and shows it again here. The atmosphere and tone of the settings fit the story perfect. The movie is brutal just like the book and also that is handled great. Neither reduced or overdone.The music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is as expected amazing. Almost as great as for The Social Network. I loved the opening credits set to the tones of the Immigrant Song cover. Some may feel it's a bit out of place but personally I loved it.So are there any weak points in it? Well the last parts of the movie the story slows down somewhat but thats because Stieg Larsson's novel was like that and those parts are also needed for the continuing of the series. And even if I really like the Millennium trilogy, the story is not perfect not as complicated as some might expect. Doesn't mess with your head like Se7en.If I'm to rank David Fincher's detective thrillers The girl with the dragon tattoo is below Se7en and Zodiac but it doesn't mean it is a weak movie, definitely not! I don't think I can find much they could have done better. The Swedish movie was good but this is much better. It lives up to my expectations as a fan of the book.

On Par with the Swedish Version,"Part owner of Millennium magazine, Mikael Blomquist (Daniel Craig) is convicted of libel, but has some time before sentencing and is hired by Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) to find out what happened to Harriet, his niece, who disappeared 40-years ago and is believed deceased. Mikael hires Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) to help with his investigation.I believe most movie goers have seen the Swedish version of this movie and are busy comparing notes of what was similar, different and so on. So let's get to it.For my part, I have also seen the Swedish version and it was excellent having watched via sub titles, but I must go on record as saying the US version is just as good but perhaps, more clear regarding the story line. The Swedish version had too many sub plots that had one memorizing them to see what impact they would have on the main story. None is the answer.Differences......there are some. The setting is Sweden, but the currency is not touted in Swedish Kronas, but USD; no accents were heard and they were clever enough not to show us traffic direction signs that were in Swedish. In the Swedish version I do not recall Henrik Vanger purchasing controlling interest in Millennium magazine. Where Harriet is discovered is completely different in this version. Does it matter? No. There were no lingering shots of the landscapes as were in the Swedish version. Pity, I missed them.One big difference is that in this version Mikael tracks down Lisbeth to help in his investigation whereas in the Swedish version it is Lisbeth who hacks into Mikael's computer to give him clues re the disappearance of Harriet as she knows what he was hired for by Henrik. Then Mikael feels she can help him. Does this make any difference to the story? No.Now for the question I just know you have: Who was the better Mikael? Michael Nyqvist or Daniel Craig? They were both excellent and no one outdid the other.But, let's get to the real question: Who was the better Lisbeth Salander? Noomi Rapace or Rooney Mara? Both were excellent, and could have been interchangeable, but..this story made the Rooney Lisbeth softer, more giving. But, we cared more for the Noomi Lisbeth because we wanted her to be softer, more giving and she wasn't. But we still cared more for her. See? Also, the Swedish version had more story face time with Noomi than with Rooney.Both versions had the sex scenes between Mikael and Lisbeth but the US version showed them 2-times whereas the Swedish version only once. In this version, Lisbeth orally servicing her Guardian was shown more graphically and the rape scene seemed to go on longer here than in the Swedish version. More total frontal nudity was shown in this version.Both versions are very good and quite engaging and the differences do not hinder the story, but in the US version things become clearer without the non-important sub plots that were in the Swedish version. If you didn't see the Swedish version, this version will do. But, if you want to compare notes..Now for the question that still remains: Is there another country that will do a remake of this story? England? India? (hey, India makes more movies than the US. Why should they be left out? Huh?) And, yes there are two more stories to this trilogy. Any takers on the horizon? (10/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes, 2-times. Nudity: Yes, frontal too. Lesbian Kisses: Yes. Rape Scene:Yes and quite graphic too. Language: Yes. four F-bombs were counted.Rating: A",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Another Tattooist's Needle in a Haystack...,"Lisbeth Salander knows exactly what to do, to the men who have no honour, morals, rules, without virtue, displaying little sympathy, for bigoted misogyny, wears a dragon on her back that takes the form of a tattoo - but sadly nowhere near as good as when Noomi Rapace passed through.Together with Mikael she's tracking down a killer, a little bit contrived but not a disengaging filler, skulduggery unwinds, over decades lost in time, an admirable transfer, non English theme to Hollywood thriller.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
I love it!,"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a thriller exploring crime and psychology. It stars Daniel Craig as journalist Mikael Blomkvist and Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander. Supporting roles are portrayed by Christopher Plummer, Stellan Skarsgård, Steven Berkoff, and Robin Wright.After losing an expensive legal case to a famous businessperson, Swedish journalist Mikael Blomkvist helped wealthy industrialist Henrik Vanger with writing his life story. Blomkvist understands that Vanger wants to find out who killed his dear great-niece, who disappeared from the family's island in 1966.Daniel Craig delivers an exceptional performance and is a perfect fit for detective roles such as 007's James Bond or Detective Benoit Blanc in Knives Out. His cool, calm, and confident demeanor in front of the camera makes him stand out from the rest. Rooney Mara also carries a significant portion of the film's weight with her dark and brooding character, which undergoes a significant amount of character development throughout the film, to the point where she is just as captivating as Craig's Blomkvist towards the end.This film is dark, with a haunting atmosphere and explicit scenes. The film's portrayal of certain characters' dark intentions was effective in keeping me interested. The plot's twists and turns drew me in further, leaving me guessing until the final reveal. However, at over two and a half hours, the film's runtime can feel too long and drag in certain places, which was my only complaint. Fincher's skillful direction and the fantastic performances by the cast elevate this movie beyond the average crime thriller and make it one of his finest films. It's a shame we never got to see Fincher's remake of the trilogy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Solidly told story that builds well and has a real visual impact thanks to direction and cinematography,"I'm probably one of the few people left who came to this film knowing nothing about it whatsoever. I never saw the original films even though I knew I should and, while I was aware that the story was some form of mystery with roots in history, I had more of a ""Dan Brown"" type story in my mind and I wasn't sure if I would like it. The opening credits of the US version threw me even more as I wasn't sure what these visceral figures were about or if they were indicative of the film to come. Fortunately after the impact of the credits the film does settle down somewhat and more of a story begins to be told.I had been told that the film was hard to follow and I agreed with Blomkvist when he comments to Vanger that he will struggle with all the names, but the latter was correct when he says soon enough you'll know them. Accordingly the story does flow well throughout the film with the mystery unfolding in a way that takes the viewer with it rather than pulling it out of the blue towards the end, or demanding the audience do too much work. It does help that it is fairly superficial as a story when you boil it down to its basics, but it is presented with a lot going on and a sense of danger and darkness that I enjoyed. It is probably longer than it needs to be but it doesn't ever really drag; there is some time at the end of the film after the mystery has been solved that could have been reigned in, but in fairness they extend the character of Lisbeth so it wasn't time wasted. Similarly although the sexual material between Lisbeth and her new guardian is secondary to the mystery, it is worth it because it informs us on her.Having made Social Network, Fincher seemed to be a good choice for a plot that involves a lot of computer searching and pouring over old records – and indeed he was, to the point that he is the real selling point here. He directs with a real good touch along with Social Network cinematographer Cronenweth. There is little action but the shot framing and the feel of the film gives it a tension and an edge that suits the superficial feel it does have. This isn't a great aspect of the film but it isn't a major problem either since I felt that the delivery of the story does rather cover these weaknesses. I was fortunate to come to the cast without the need to compare with the original (having never seen it) and perhaps I liked them more for this. Mara is good but I never shook off the feeling of her lacking an edge and too often I didn't feel like this character was fully fleshed out in her hands – still good, but that feeling stuck with me. Craig is strong in the lead as he plays quite a bookish type. The support is deep in faces all doing good work – Plummer, Skarsgård, Berkoff, Richardson, Wright and others.Overall Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a solidly engaging mystery that is a little bit too long but mostly unfolds well thanks to strong delivery in the superficial aspects. The cast, the cinematography and the direction create a sense of darkness and danger that is effective at taking the viewer along. I'm not seeing the brilliant film or story that millions other around the world proclaim it as, but I did enjoy it for what it did well.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
An excellent film but not for everyone.,"This movie surprised me a lot, a plot very well written and with well-built characters. I really liked the synchrony between Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, the two deliver excellent performances, and the investigation theme is worked very precisely, of course with some questionable scenes but nothing that breaks the immersion. Very good movie.The film is certainly not made for all audiences, it has several scenes that can trigger triggers in people who are victims of psychological, moral and sexual abuse. But the script is well written, the characters are not generic and the film knows how to work the investigative part well.In fact it has a very heavy atmosphere but it is a great plot for fans of criminal investigation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
David Fincher Recreates,"David Fincher is able to recreate the first of the Swedish hit trilogy based on the novels. The style is similar with the Swedish original. It's got the cold blue tone, and the same desolate morality. It hasn't been transplanted to anywhere else. In fact, it's basically kept the whole thing intact with the exception of the actors. Daniel Craig is a Hollywood choice to be the journalist. Of course, he's 007. Sure he's hot. So when Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) sleeps with him, it is less about his personality and a little more about his James Bond body. But it's to be expected for a Hollywood remake. Rooney Mara is just not as intense as Noomi Rapace. Rooney is a skinny girly actress with some good acting skills. She has just enough to play the anger. But Noomi has more. The original Lisbeth was a true discovery.I hate to compare the two, but they are so close that they're begging to be compared. Overall I liked the Swedish one slightly more but just very slightly. Some of that probably is due to the fact that I saw that one first. David Fincher does a great job of recreating the original.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"It's long, it's intense, it's abusive, it's fascinating, and it has some acute acting","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)It's hard to just take this movie straight up--it's a very close and really excellent remake of an excellent and probably slightly more incisive Swedish original movie by the same name, and based on a book (three books actually) that a lot of people have read. But in one sentence, let me try.The newer ""Girl"" is a tightly made, well seen, well acted, beautifully situated historical crime drama hampered by a little too much complexity, leading to too much explaining and not enough plain old happening.The best of the film is brilliant stuff, fast and vigorous, compelling as much as the first version. The worst of the film repeats some problems of the first version, including abuse of the characters that borders on the sadistic.A couple comparisons will help even those who haven't seen the 2009 film. Daniel Craig is a more handsome and a bit more polished an actor than the Swedish leading man, Michael Nyquist, but Nyquist is frankly more believable, more Swedish (of course), and a genuine original.The two women who play the title character are an interesting parallel, their names even with odd echoes--Rooney and Noomi. Rooney Mara (a New Yorker with a pretty good accent) is the 2011 girl with the dragon tattoo, and her tattoo may be less impressive, but her intensity is in place. She gives the movie its ultimate edge. Noomi Rapace, a native Swede though of mixed background, has some edge in personality, a slightly quirky violence and a more believable detachment from people around here, going beyond simply refusing to shake anyone's hand. Rapace's performance is completely memorable, and as good as Mara is (and she is really good), Rapace is better--more distinctive, more beautifully awkward, and even, in the end, more convincing. Check it out--the first movie of the Swedish trilogy only, however.There is something frankly weird about Fincher's whole enterprise when the Swedish original is so good, and so Fincher-esque already. Yes, Fincher adds more atmosphere, including some very ""Seven"" inspired rain and music (Trent again, with a Led Zeppelin twist over the astonishing and deflecting visuals in the opening credits). But what really is to be gained by remaking the movie so soon, and with such little original input? It's almost a grad student exercise with a superstar's production budget. (The answer, sadly, might be that they wanted to cash in on the phenomenon of the trilogy before it was too late, remembering the American public's aversion to movies with subtitles. It has made $100 million in profit so far.)So we end up analyzing Fincher's ""Dragon Tattoo"" indirectly. It was made to echo the Oplev version from just two years earlier, and it does. Scene by scene, you'll find overlaps, and interesting shifts, and there must be a web page out there that compares the two movies. For me, having seen each movie once, the really big differences are: 1) a more taut, spare (and Swedish?) relationship between the two leads in the first version, which is really the core of the movie beyond the sensationalist Nazi/rape/money plot, and 2) a highly different ending in both feel and significance (which I won't give away).Let's say you haven't seen either film. What to do? Well, if you love Fincher already, you'll want to see how he's doing. But if you want a movie with a little more space to it, a little less glitz and a little more honest intensity in the characters, see the Swedish one. If you see both, which isn't really necessary (they're incredibly similar), you might note the American version cost $90 million to make and the Swedish only $13.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
I seem to be missing something,"I watched The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo last night for the first time and....well...what am I missing? Long, slow, boring really. Granted it was network TV so I'm guessing I watched a very edited version, but still, I can't see what all the fuss was about. Daniel Craig was his usual flat self (missing what all the fuss is about him too but I'll save that for another time.) Rooney Mara did an OK job as Lisbeth I suppose, but I thought I'd be watching a much more seething, angry, dangerous character. Disappointing is the only word I can think of to describe the film. Now I have to admit I did not read the book (yet- but I've got it right here) and did not see the original version (yet). But I have to guess the cut scenes must have added a lot of impact to the movie because what I watched was a fairly bland, not very interesting, overly long, disappointing effort.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

A very well Executed Film!!,"It is a well-executed and gripping crime thriller that left a lasting impression on me. From its compelling storyline to its masterful suspense and stellar performances by the main characters, this movie truly delivers on its promise as a top-notch thriller.The heart of the film lies in its intricate plot, which is both engaging and intricately woven. The mysteries and secrets that unravel throughout the story keep you on the edge of your seat, eager to uncover the truth. The narrative is carefully crafted, and it's evident that the filmmakers paid meticulous attention to detail, respecting the source material.The performances in this movie are nothing short of remarkable. Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander and Daniel Craig as Mikael Blomkvist bring their characters to life with depth and authenticity. Their on-screen chemistry is palpable, adding an extra layer of intrigue to the story. Mara, in particular, shines in her role, embodying the complex and enigmatic Lisbeth Salander with a captivating intensity.What sets ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" apart is its ability to maintain a sense of unease and suspense throughout. The film doesn't shy away from the darker aspects of the story, and it doesn't hesitate to take you to some unsettling places. This unflinching approach to storytelling adds to the overall intensity and keeps you invested in the mystery until the very end.I found the movie's atmosphere and cinematography to be highly effective.

Excellent Performances and Strong Direction,"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The (2011)*** 1/2 (out of 4)David Fincher's telling of the Stieg Larsson novel about a reporter (Daniel Craig) who is asked by an elderly man (Christopher Plummer) to find out who murdered his niece forty years earlier. The report comes upon on dead end after another so he seeks the help of a troubled but brilliant computer hacker (Rooney Mara). I haven't read the novel so I can't comment one way or another on how close this film is to it but as someone who wasn't familiar with the story I must say that Fincher has created a rather unique film. I say unique because while watching the movie I couldn't help but admire how laid back it actually is. There's really not any flashy style, in-your-face fake thrill moments and there's an overall atmosphere of something very calm and cold. Those familiar with the work of Ingmar Bergman will probably see a connection to his films because of this coldness that is one full display here. The film takes place in the winter and you can just feel the coldness really coming off the screen and it's this white, almost dreamlike nature that really makes the film work so well. The images in front of us are usually quite pretty but they're all surrounding by a rather brutal and ugly story that tackles many taboo subjects. Fincher handles the material quite well and with a running time of 158-minutes I was shocked to see how well he kept the thing moving as there's really not a slow or dry moment to be found. The pacing is incredibly good and this is especially impressive considering how much he packs into the running time and how there's very little action. Of course, another major benefit are the performances with Craig really turning in one of the best of his career. I've read a few negative reviews saying that he's too ""James Bond"" here as a reporter but I didn't find that to be the case at all. Plummer is always reliable and we get nice supporting performances by Robin Wright and Stellan Skarsgard. Then there's the Oscar-nominated Mara who easily steals the show. She's completely believable in the part and it doesn't matter if she's being abused or giving the abuse as you can see her in both sides. THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO features a terrific score, some wonderful cinematography and all of this adds up to a very good thriller. I wouldn't call it a classic but it's certainly in a league to itself.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Spectacular,"Only seen once before the most memorable aspect was Orinoco Flow being in it and how incredible the directing is throughout! I don't know even have knowledge on the book but this is very enjoyable in the bulk of it only aspect that I'd complain about is some of it is slow yet stays brilliant and intriguing as it goes.Rooney Mara's transformation is one of the best things about this Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Rooney deserves all roles and praise she's gotten since! The use Enya's Orinoco Flow is among the greatest scenes in history in my opinion I genuinely wish the song could be used more and even better after all the build up.Gosh I love David Fincher I want to own more by him and I wish I could spend time him maybe pick at his brain for hours.

The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"I stumbled upon the ""Millennium series"" in 2010, while I was browsing through internet. The cover of the book looked interesting enough for me to place an order for it. By the time book had arrived I had gained some information about the author and his rather unfortunate demise. It seemed quite mystifying to me that author died shortly after handing his manuscripts to the publisher.Any ways, as I started reading it; I knew that I will like it for sure. As it happens with most readers, I too had a mental picture of how Lisbeth would look in real life.For me she was a real character, a real person, whom I dreamt of meeting one day and telling her how awesome she is. As u may have guessed, by the time I finished reading the first book I had ordered the next two instalments already.Then I heard about a movie series based on the trilogy. The problem was where I could find them. Finally I caught 20 minutes of the ""The girl who played with fire"" Swedish version on HBO.Was the movie good enough?Did Noomi Rapace justify the character of Lisbeth Salander. From what I could make out of 20 minutes of movie,the answer was ""yes"". Of course I had imagined Lisebth Salander a bit differently but she was close enough. I had also expected Mikael Blomkvist to be a bit more charming.Then came the news of English version of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" directed by David Fincher, starring Daniel Craig as Mikael Blomkvist and Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander about whom I had never heard before. I was Excited and why wouldn't I be. After all Daniel fitted into my image of Mikael Perfectly but I had my doubts about Rooney.Finally the day came when movie released but to my utter disappointment its release in India was delayed. Date of its release was set as 10 Feb 2012.So I was looking forward to that day and reviews about the movie only added to my anxiousness. But fate wasn't on my side. Movie was cancelled in India due to some images in movie which"" Indian censor board"" found disturbing. What can I say other than, I hated them for it and I even wrote them an e-mail expressing my utter disappointment. Somehow I got my hands on its Blu-Ray version from someplace.Finally came the judgement day. To tell you honestly, how did 2 and a half hours went by, I Don't remember. It was like reading the book again but even better. Lisebth was exactly what I had imagined her to be. Everything was just ""PERFECT"". The acting, screenplay, direction, music,everything was top notch. I have nothing but only good things to say about the movie. It was an experience worth having. Rooney Mara played Lisbeth Salander perfectly and Daniel Craig left no stone unturned. It felt good to finally see my mental image of Lisbeth take shape flawlessly.I have rated the movie a 10/10 in IMDb, because it accomplished its purpose and much more. I felt so deeply moved after watching the movie, that I sat down and Wrote this review. I am really looking forward to next instalment in the series.Finally I would like to end my review with these lines from the movie...Dragan : ""She is different""Dirch:""In what way?""Dragan:""In every way!""",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Did we need it?,"There's, as most should know, a perfectly good Swedish movie out there. So I really don't get why remake it, for no other reason (I guess), that Americans hate reading subtitles. And Rooney Mara can never replace Noomi Rapace's incredible performance as Lisbeth. What saves the movie is the ever talented David Fincher, who always knows how to get that dark, noirish feeling. But as a remake, it follows the original by the dots. Except the rape scene, which was thankfully toned down. I also have a gripe hearing American actors pronounching Swedish names. It just sounds silly, and they really should have considered moving the story to a Fargoesque location in Nebraska, or somewhere. Swedish names+American actors=A bit of hit and miss. Most miss.

Brilliant Cinema From All Concerned,"Despite any reservations a viewer might have about a prompt English version re-make of a very successful Swedish film still popular in this country - the first novel in author Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy, namely GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO - this version of Larsson's story is immensely successful. Much of that is due to the tightly woven screenplay by Steven Zaillian and the extraordinary direction by one of our most gifted directors, David Fincher (Fight Club, The Social Network, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Seven, etc). But also the gifts of the musical composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (with a bit of help from a very well placed Morten Lauridson's 'Lux Aeterna') and the bitingly vivid cinematography of Jeff Cronenweth. Add to that one of the finest collection of actors ever to collaborate on a project and the result is a film that is so engrossing that its very long length doesn't seem long enough!Everyone knows the story by now: disgraced journalist, Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), escapes to an island in Sweden at the request of Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) to investigate the 40 year absence of his niece Harriet. The Vanger family is as dysfunctional and bitterly cruel an ensemble as could be imagined and everyone on the island wants Mikael to leave. The case fascinates Mikael and he gains access to the services of an associate, the very bizarre and brilliant pierced, tattooed, punk computer hacker named Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara). As they work together in the investigation, Blomkvist and Salander uncover immense corruption beyond anything they have ever imagined. There are indelible characters along the way: the disgustingly sadistic Nils Bjurman (a brilliant role for Yorick van Wageningen) who mistakenly sexually abuses Lisbeth who in turn has her own manner of revenge), the wily Martin Vanger (Stellan Skarsgård), a brief but impressive Dragan Armansky (Goran Visnjic), Anita Vanger (Joely Richardson), Inspector Morelli (Donald Sumpter) etc etc etc. Every role is cast so carefully that there is never a missed beat in this huge ensemble.For those who love the Swedish version of GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO this English version will surely satisfy. They are different but for this viewer the English version is far more memorable. There is considerable frank sexual activity, torture, animal abuse, and there are some gruesome scenes: they add and must be there. Kudos to all concerned. And yes, Rooney Mara really is that fine!Grady Harp",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Best film of the Year',"As a huge fan of the books and original movie in 2009 I had high hopes for the newest addition and was in no way disappointed. The movie was in fact incredible, with all the suspense and vast intelligence of the book and 2009 film this remake has easily made itself a contender for the best film of the year. The script was incredible, location and shooting was beautiful and the cast was absolutely incredible. As a lover of Daniel Craig and Stellan Skarsgaard I expected great things and was not disappointed, but both had to take a back seat for the lifetime performance by Rooney Mara. Easily one of the best performances I have seen in a very long time, you could see every part of her being and soul went into playing the amazing Lisbeth Salander, Noomi Rapace should be proud that her amazing performance in 2009 has been carried on to the same excellence with this astounding remake.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Great display of film mastery,"This was the first film I watched after seeing The Hunger Games, and it may sound weird, but in comparison this felt like a ""real film"". I haven't read the book or seen the Swedish version, but this film definitely made me interested in seeing it (and its sequels) which is all you can really ask for in an adaptation. In stark contrast Hunger games didn't give me any interest in reading the book, strengthening the quality of this film.Fincher made some brilliant choices in this film that could have easily gone unnoticed, for example when Lisbeth is about to be raped the camera pulls away from the room and fades to black. In a lesser film this would be the end of the scene, but Fincher throws us right back into it by cutting back into the room and forcing us to witness the rape. It's a great way to manipulate the audience expectations, and it reminded me of something Akira Kurosawa said: ""The role of the artist is to not look away"". In this scene alone Fincher proves his artistry.I'll admit that the story is a bit slow paced in the beginning but it does a nice job of luring you into the two story-lines. Hopefully they will make the other two films.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Epic cinematic misery that will keep you grabbing the armchair,"Two years after seeing the original Swedish films, I couldn't wait for the Girl with the dragon tattoo to hit the theaters. Ever since that incredible first trailer burned into my retinas, I had a feeling this remake wouldn't fail. And not only it didn't fail, it delivered with style, grit and dark edginess I was hoping for. The cast is pretty much spot on. Daniel Craig, with a few extra pounds, gives an impressive and convincing role of a journalist Mikael Blomkvist. Compared to Michael Nyquist from the original trilogy, which performance I enjoyed very much, Craig is definitively up to the task.Of course, all eyes are on Rooney Mara playing Lisbeth Salander - an incredibly complex, solitary and traumatized hacker, who is hired to help Blomkvist solve a 40 year old mystery. Mara is simply amazing in portraying Lisbeth, both visually and emotionally, it's such a believable performance that after a while you simply cannot imagine her not being Lisbeth in real life.Cinematically, Fincher leads the movie with strings of superbly done shots, great dialogs and occasional shocker scenes that will get the hair on your neck stand up. While the run-time of 2 and a half hours may seem long, the time simply flies by and you end up wanting the movie to never end.I only have two small complaints: first is casting Sarsgard as Martin Vanger. While I love Skarsgard and have seen many of his movies, for someone who's even slightly familiar with his work, there will be no doubt about what happens at the end. Second is about Lisbeth Salander character. While I can not praise Mara's performance enough, I have to say that Noomi Rapace in the original movie was more ""manly"". I know that it may not make much sense, but little details in walking, expressions and gestures made Rapace even more detached from any feminine characteristic. Rapace's performance made me feel that Lisbeth was so troubled and traumatized that she had lost almost any feeling of connection to humanity. For example, I loved the fact that Noomi in original movie had unshaven armpits. It was such a small detail, but it instantly made you realize just how messed up her life is. While Mara is astonishing as Lisbeth, there's no mistake that she's a woman - albeit damaged, but still feminine enough.Many have mentioned violence and some other ""tough to swallow"" scenes. Honestly, they will make you feel really uncomfortable, but that's the point. They are not gore, they're not glorified and are certainly there for a good reason. Ommiting them would be a big mistake.One more thing - the intro scene is pure audio-visual orgasm. I can hardly think of anything I enjoyed watching more on big screen then those first few minutes.Overall - 10/10. And watch the originals as well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
NOT as good as the Swedish film,"I saw the movie last night. First of all; I admit I was biased going in ( in favor of the original Swedish film; why remake a movie made only 2 years ago? ), but they seemed torn between the native language for the scenery, and English for most of the computer screens. And I admit it has been a while since I read the book, but they could have spent a little more time on how Lizbet go they way she was.Like the book ( and the Swedish original ) it was a little distracting bouncing back and forth between Blomqvest's story and Salander's until they merged, but the plots ( plural ) were very well done.And other than to save a little money, I' not sure why they left out the part about Australia ( I'm putting this intentionally a little vague to prevent a spoiler for those who have not read the book ).Others seem to prefer this to the original; I am not convinced the acting was any better. I have to recommend the original Swedish film on DVD.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"A Highly Entertaining, Smart, Fast-Paced, Dark Murder Mystery","I have seen the Swedish films, yet not read the books. The US version is not a remake of the Swedish version; it is simply another adaptation of the novel. I must say I was very impressed with the pacing and over-all style and raw feeling of the US version of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. The story, whether from the books, Swedish version or US version is quite a dark and winding journey. If you have not read the books or watched the Swedish versions I recommend now starting with the US version of the film. This US version will be the first of the trilogy; The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl who played with Fire, and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets Nest.The opening credit sequence, as I'm sure many of you have heard is quite amazing. I loved it and all the work they put into it. It was very Bond like yet encompassed the dark complexities of this story and the film. This film is much more speedy than the Swedish versions. I found the Swedish films to be a little slow at times, which yes builds tension however the pacing of the US version is much more my speed. Very fast and smart.It is a murder mystery film, however it is also about the two main characters and their interactions and working together to solve a murder, or series of murders. I do not want to give anything away as the story and how it unfolds is what makes the movie run so well. Clocking in at 2 hours and 40 minutes, the US version is quite long. However it is a movie which you rather it not end due to the entertaining characters and the intense visual situations which you wish to look away from, but you can't.When it comes to the characters, I found that Rooney Mara played a much better Lisbeth than Noomi Rapace. And the interactions with Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) were great and at times quite funny. The two of them working together when they seem to be opposites was very entertaining and Daniel and Rooney pulled it off perfectly. As a huge fan of the new Bond reboots I have grown to love Daniel Craig and enjoy seeing him on the screen. He is a very talented actor and seems to give the audience what they want. Stellan Skarsgård, Christopher Plummer and Robin Wright also did a great job, as well as the other cast members. Each character was very carefully cast and bond perfectly to the heart of this film.The story, the acting, the directing; everything was perfect and I must say that director David Fincher is at the top of his game. For those who do not know, he directed Fight Club, Se7en, The Game, Zodiac, The Social Network, Alien 3, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and Panic Room. The music, the ambiance, and the over-all dark feel to the film was so well done I couldn't believe it. I could not have asked for a better-crafted film. I am quite anxious to see the rest of the trilogy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The Movie with Overrated Rating.,"As a person that read the book and watched the Swedish version of the movie, my first conclusion is people rated this movie without watching. I am not saying the movie is bad but considering the book, it is just fine (even at the edge of fine). The character development phase is ultra lame. I watched the movie with couple of friends and at the end they had a lot of questions in mind. Considering the length of the movie, one can easily judge how bad the script was. There were so many useless details (and yeah, I read the other two books as well. I know what I am talking about). If you sum up the time spent on details neither necessary for this movie nor the rest of the series, one could use that time to tell the story properly. Lets talk about the positive sides as well. The script follows the book in an OK manner (but towards the ending I guess the script writer got bored). On the other hand, everything is so rushed. I must say, the scenery is well portrait. Lastly, I need to warn you about the adult content as well. This is simply not a family movie. As a conclusion, an OK movie but not a masterpiece or what so ever.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Not really better than the original,"Why do an English language version of a stunning foreign film? There are all sorts of reasons to do so and good ones. Perhaps the foreign culture got in the way of Americans appreciating the story fully, or perhaps the film was not well distributed in English-language countries. The North American market is huge and there are plenty of dollars for a film that probably played mostly in art houses (e.g. Pour Elle became The Next Three Days--practically duplicates). Tattoo, however, had a robust DVD viewing, so it's not like it lacked exposure. And sometimes a director has a particular point of view that he or she thinks will enhance or illuminate the story -- perfectly reasonable.But I really cannot say why David Fincher took on a redo of this film. He brought nothing new to it. It's a copy tweaked here and there and not near as gritty as the original. And I'm not all that enthusiastic about some of the changes he made in Lisbeth's or Blomquist's character or in the story wrap up.The first hour is quite slow--I even nodded off for a few minutes. It picks up when Lisbeth and Blomquist finally begin working together, although this Lisbeth is somewhat more into Blomquist. Despite Lisbeth's severe goth look, it's not as hard and realistic as Rapace's. Rooney Mara is Hollywood Lisbeth. Rapace has more street cred,she wasn't pretty & looked somewhat boyish.I love David Fincher, think he's one of the best storytellers in film today. But I can't see compelling reasons for his efforts in this film. In any case, you'll enjoy the movie...again. But you won't leave the theatre in shock and awe.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"WHY, but WHY did they replace Rapace...","I've read the books first. Really liked it.Then, I've watched the Swedish version and I was really mad about all the things they changed and deleted from the book. They had a hard time linking all the different part, but they did a good job in some few parts, like I preferred the photograph of the parade, I believed more into the setting of the parade or of the bridge accident and stuff. I've started the second movie, it's really horrible. The girl they picked to play Myriam isn't even a little Asian. After 5 to 10 min, it was so boring I stopped it.Then, I've watched the American version. I was immediately mad about the casting. OK, I get it, you need big movie stars and all. It's fine for Craig, I don't care that much and even though he has a big part in the story, his character personality isn't as marked as the one of Lisbeth. BUT WHY, WHY DID THEY CHANGED LISBETH? Rapace speaks English AND she is the PERFECT actress to play the part of Lisbeth. In my mind, when I read the book, the face and body I had in mind was almost exactly alike. Mara is just so generic in her strangeness. And she's SO dull! Lisbeth isn't suppose to look or be shy, she's suppose to be asocial, there's a big difference. Maybe it has something to do with her acting skills, I don't know. I pray that they switch it up for the 2 movie that still remain, but I know I'm wasting my time. Such a waste when you have an actress that is just so totally perfect for the role. I prefer almost all the cast of the American version better though, except for her (obviously) and for Plague, the hacker, who's just... he's too cliché.The story, the respect they kept for the original book, it's so much better in the American movie. But maybe a little too much clean, too much ""high budget"", it somewhat distracted me sometimes - too much American overall even though they kept the Sweden scenery and stuff. But it was OK for the setting of the island and the houses of the Vanger family (is the Swedish version, the houses are not fancy enough, it's just a little weird)...The best movie would have been a mix of both, the American version could have been awesome if they just understand how important the casting of Lisbeth is (for those who did not read the books, you'll see what I mean in the next 2 movies - I really feel like she is much more important then Blomkvist in the trilogy).",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Disappointing and very predictable.,"This film to me was basically a typical, cheesy detective/mystery TV show with some sex thrown in so as to make it long enough to be called a movie.By calling it cheesy, I mean that it was cliché and very predictable. As soon as the killer came on screen, I whispered to my boyfriend, ""That's the killer,"" and I was right. The ending was obviously going to end the way that it did. I just wasn't surprised by the movie at all and found myself getting bored and impatient. My boyfriend suggested we leave the theater because he saw I wasn't enjoying it but I stayed, hoping it would get better by the end.The acting was good, which is why I gave it 5 stars. Overall I was very disappointed, especially after expecting so much more from the high rating on IMDb. If I had watched the movie with lower expectations, I probably would have rated it higher.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Slow burn, yet tense throughout.","A long movie that takes its time to tell its story. The dark tone, coupled with Fincher's directing guides this film. All of the technical filmmaking aspects are nailed here and no one should have any complaints in that regard.The acting was excellent, especially Roonie Mara, who steals the show.The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo's slow burn may turn off some viewers, but if you give it time, you'll find an eerie, dark, and ultimately poignant story about these characters.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
David Fincher crafts yet another masterpiece,"Right from the start of this films opening titles, I was taken back to when I had first watched 'Fight Club'. The opening title sequence for this film was even more exhilarating to watch than that of the one opening for Fight Club. The rest of the film was a journey into the greatness that has made Fincher films almost a household name by now.It is easy to say that this was better than the Swedish version of this film, and partly thanks to the performance by Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander. I can't say that I have ever been more attracted to a character on film than in this one. Even though, she is quite the bad-ass and about as tomboy as they come, I couldn't help but be engaged by every scene she was in.On another note, this is not an easy film to watch. It does contain a scene of rape and a couple acts of sexual assault on top of that. With all these coming together to form something almost as disturbing as the scene from the lesser know film by Gaspar Noe 'Irreversible'.Everything is perfectly shot here as well, and really does have the 'David Fincher' touch, although, this film felt about the least Hollywood-ised of all his pictures. Fans of the Swedish Trilogy will not be let down here. This is about as intense as crime thrillers get, and for those who call this a remake, for them, this is without a doubt the best remake I think I have seen on screen. Nothing falls into place like you think it will, and as the film ends, I felt a knot in my stomach, and wished I could know the character Lisbeth in real life.The score here done by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is again Oscar worthy after winning last year for their work on Finchers other film, 'The Social Network'. It does have similar tones here, but all in all comes out totally fresh in every scene.Overall, this is easily one of the best films of the year. This could have also been easily predicted coming from me, considering my likeness for David Fincher films. Fincher was responsible for me partly coming to love for films back in 1999 with his film 'Fight Club', which took 1/3 of the reason why I came to love movies in the first place (also in there, Stanley Kubricks 'Eyes Wide Shut', and Sam Mendes', 'American Beauty' —all from 1999) and this film shows that Fincher is indeed one of the best filmmakers in the business today.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Unnecessary Remake,"A journalist teams up with a computer hacker to find a woman missing for 40 years. As Larsson's popular novel was made into a decent Swedish film two years earlier, was a Hollywood remake really necessary? Everything is overdone, starting with the ridiculous opening credits. It is poorly paced and goes on much too long, yet the plot is a bit murky at times. Craig does better in the role of the journalist than Nyqvist in the original film. As for the Lisbeth, the edge goes to Rapace, who wasn't particularly good in the original, but Mara is too robotic here. However, Lisbeth is such a one-note character that it would be difficult for any actress to make her anything more than a caricature.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A Must See,"Saw both films and read the trilogy.I was skeptical adaptation about a Hollywood adaptation of the novel after having seen the Swedish film and loving it. However, Fincher has crafted a film that is outstanding in its own right.And after falling in love with Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander I didn't think that I could see anyone else in the role, but Mara nails it and creates an interpretation of Salander all her own.I wouldn't say that Blomkvist as played by Daniel Craig is better, but the novels continually describe how handsome the character is and how many women he beds. I never believed that Michael Nyqvist inhabited those aspects of the character even though his performance in all other areas was admirable. Craig as Blomkvist does possess a charisma that his Swedish counterpart did not.Hopefully this film will perform well, as I would like to see this team continue with adaptations of the rest of the trilogy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Doesn't compare to the Swedish version,"The Swedish version was much more well-written, orchestrated, and directed. There was a sense of suspense, emotion, and realism to the movie that the Fincher version simply lacks. Lisbeth's past is seldom explored, and when it is, it's poorly placed in the movie. The emotional connection between Mikael and Lisbeth is 'forced' at best, and quite awkward at certain moments. There are so many interesting facets about Lisbeth's personality and character that could've been explored a lot better, and you simply don't leave the theatre with the same sense of 'wow' that defined the Swedish version. The more positive thing about Fincher's version though, is Rooney Mara, who played Salander nicely.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
What's the point?,"First off I should say that I have not read the books, so I can't really say which version is more faithful to the vision of the late author. I've watched the original Swedish film however and as a movie it's infinitely superior and more exciting to watch as a mystery. Simply put, the original movie is more entertaining.In the Swedish version the plot unfolds brilliantly, allowing the viewer to really follow the investigation and get enthralled in the story. The Hollywood adaptation is basically 2.5 hours of Daniel Craig talking here and there without much coherence. Most major twists and turns happen through logical leaps within moments that you can't really follow.Daniel Craig's performance is not bad however, the writing and the pacing is what makes this movie bland and uninteresting. And then you have Lisbeth's character which is so overwhelmingly amazing in the Swedish version that there isn't any comparison really. Again, Rooney Mara's performance is not bad at all, the character just isn't as brilliantly written unfortunately.Which really begs the question, what was the point of this remake. The original is just 2 years old and is superior in every way imaginable. I suppose if you are a native English speaker that refuses to watch subtitled movies it might appeal to you, but if -like me- you get to watch both of them subtitled, there is really no reason whatsoever to watch this version.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The Exploited Sex Pistols,"I have not seen the Swedish film so cannot tell you what this does by contrast. No, I came to this after feeling spent from some recent heavy duty viewing and looking to unwind with slick pop darkness and gratuitous mystery: looking for a detective film where the detective did all the work for us and we just sat back and appreciated the mechanics. A film very much like Seven then, with its own type of abrasiveness.This is Fincher's job in Hollywood, to be our current Billy Wilder. A perfectly efficient working hand who can subordinate himself to what a story demands so long as he gets a few spots to exercise his game.Superficially the thing is written around three girls, each one coveted in some way and in turn some part missing.One is the young heiress of the company and beloved sister long presumed dead and the trigger for our movie: we visit the place, a remote island with suspects arranged like pawns on a board game, and begin to unpack a narrative that happened long ago and is thought to reveal shady foundations of an entire Swedish society. Bits and pieces from photos are animated like films that we swoop in to follow; but disjointed or parts of a whole? And true as we see or misleading testimonies?Another girl is the daughter, preppy beautiful and smart but apparently very religious. This is meant to baffle a little, as though something may be wrong with her. Daddy issues, we presume. But she gives us the one half of a clue that eventually clicks everything together; Bible quotes.The other half of the clue - Jewish names, so possible Nazi involvement - we get from what is by now the most widely advertised aspect of the film. Another investigator but this time young, eccentric, visibly tormented but a sharp mind. Pierced through with pain from, you guessed it, daddy issues. Of course our man feeling guilty for not spending time with his daughter, he makes it up to this girl her age. We're meant to understand that she is very much the product of that first violence we are investigating, and having to grapple with gross but official injustice that still goes unpunished to this day.So this is the thing that wraps the whole; each of these girls as a mirror to the others and all of them together a mirror of an abusive society. Simple but sold well. Designer hurt for the girl as a grownup's idea of what would appeal to a young demographic and on the other end contemporary political implications tied up with the one thing the Scandinavians have reason to be ashamed of - Nazi ties - to appeal to the parents. The writer has written himself in the thing as reflecting his own investigations in right-wing groups.Now Fincher's game is usually a psychological dislocation diffused into the architecture; Pitt's house by the railroad tracks in Seven, the Narrator's house in Fight Club, the entire house with a hidden room and cameras everywhere in The Panic Room. Usually he weaves some dark fiction around this, gratuitous, eye-popping stuff, but he's at his most adept when evaluating human interiors in spatial terms.I presumed here that a lot of power would be derived by the bridge setting, initially introduced as the main setting of a film-within. The complex of grey two-story homes. The main set-piece takes place in one, starting up and going down in the basement, but it's not a patch on the famous scene from Zodiac and is tritely resolved with a chase and a fireball. Nothing interesting to see, as it turns out. Maybe because Fincher is just a better filmmaker than the original writer is a writer.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"""It had nothing to do with Harriet, and yet, everything.""","Let me start off by saying that I went into this movie knowing next to nothing about its plot. I have never even picked up the book, and I never watched the Swedish version of the film, despite hearing enormous praise for both. With that being said, I was blown away with this movie.First and foremost, whether you like him or not, David Fincher makes good movies. You'd be hard-pressed to find a director that is more meticulous and intricate than he is. In the first hour of this movie, Fincher's extreme attention to detail is almost overwhelming. Not having any background knowledge of the story, I found myself struggling to keep up. I was lost with the story, I was confused about who these characters were, and to put it bluntly I felt totally in the dark. But the story reached its climax and Fincher shed light on it all. The story came together, I understood the nature of the characters, and I was impressed. All of a sudden, a story that I knew nothing about, made sense to me and I loved it. After the plot's unravelling I was totally glued and did not want the film to end.This isn't like most movies. Yeah, it's a murder mystery. Yes, it's a psychological thriller. And of course, it is ridden with gratuitous violence and sex. But it is also a love story. I went home and immediately watched the Swedish version, and I didn't feel the passion that I felt from Fincher's. It's true, Mara is not as ""strong"" or aggressive as Rapace, but that's what I loved. She's vulnerable. It was a remarkable performance on her part to capture the cold and ruthless side of Lizbeth, but at the same time expose the soft side as well. I think Mara has turned in the best female acting performance of the year, and I hope she receives the credit she deserves.I hope they complete the series because I'm riveted. I went again to only further appreciate the film's intricacies, and I can say that I'm hooked. This movie is well-acted, well-produced, and phenomenally executed.

""" When walking through the land of fear, Run!  don't wait for it to catch up. ""","From the terrifying , but fertile mind of Stieg Larsson, arrives this unusual, dark Gothic story from which the strange black novel was created. Having read the book, then seeing the visual adaption, one can see why director David Fincher did not adhere too closely to the murder/mystery story. This is one of those interesting films which attracts you because of the main star, Daniel Craig who plays disgraced novelist Mikael Blomkvist, then entertains you with scenes which are not for the faint of heart. The story begins as a film of a writer who writes an expose on a wealthy individual and fails, only to have himself dragged through the courts and ruined. He is soon recruited by a wealthy industrialist who hires him to write a biography of his strange family, and in doing so, to investigate a 40 year old mystery. When he needs help Mikael employs a superb cyber hacker who furnishes him with information which takes him far beyond where he began. Although a mystery movie, the film becomes a journey through a nightmarish world of intrigue and murder. Rooney Mara is superb as computer hacker Lisbeth Salander. Christopher Plummer and Stellan Skarsgård and Martin Vanger add mystery and intrigue to an otherwise great movie. Indeed, in time this could very well become as Classic!.

A memorable girl,"""What is hidden in snow, comes forth in the thaw."" Swedish proverbThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is indeed a girl's movie, for it is about misogyny and the revenge women can sometimes get. In between is a standard thriller, albeit classy and European, so there's much more investigation than shooting. It's an American product, based on the Swedish film of the same name in 2009, itself based on the Stieg Larsson novels about a wildly eccentric 23 year old woman, Lisbeth (Rooney Mara), who has the investigative skills of Sherlock Holmes and the prowess of La Femme Nikita.Daniel Craig plays a disgraced journalist, Mikael, engaged by a powerful family to answer one of its darkest secrets and at the same time get revenge on his courtroom antagonist, who caused his disgrace. He enjoins Lisbeth to help the investigation.With women the victims in both parts of the story, the investigations have parallel themes of revenge and feminism. Lisbeth is one of the most complicated women ever on screen. Alternately kinky and remote, tough and vulnerable, she also is ultra modern navigating both technology and sex.This iteration has all the plot points of the original and an enhancement of the relationship between journalist and assistant. In the end all is tied up, with an anticlimax that could have been left behind although it is interesting to see how the criminals receive their just rewards.Overall the film is stylish and decidedly brutal (a rape scene is shocking but still watchable) with a cerebral overlay complementing the base acts that include incest and Nazis just in case rape were not enough for the audiences on both sides of the pond. That the American version could so soon after the Swedish compel viewers and stand on its own is a tribute to director David Fincher and novelist Larsson.""Evil shall with evil be expelled.""

Connections,"One of the biggest things with this remake, was if Mara could play this role made iconic by Noomi Rapace. You'll have to answer that one for yourself, if you're even willing to watch both versions. If you ask me, it was tough watching Mara at first, because she went in a completely different direction with it, than Noomi did. But as the movie progressed, I started digging what she was doing with the character. It still would be tough to name a ""winner"", I'd say I like both women and both characters they showed on screen.Overall and after watching the original Swedish movie again, in the longer TV cut this time, I have to admit, I think Fincher improved on the Swedish film. Of course you can always try to argue with his choices (like why not change location, why let the main actors talk English most of the time and other things), but that wouldn't be a good way to spend your time. It's better to watch it and enjoy his version of the movie (though ""enjoy"" might stretch it at times, because the movie does not pull any punches!).Having said that, I'm curious why there is no connection to the original movie showing up here on IMDb. Is it that obvious that no one thought of putting it in the details? I'm not sure what happened there, though I'm sure someone will change it (it's almost April 2012, let's see how long it'll take).Comparing the two adaptations of the novel (which I haven't read), I can tell you that there are differences. Smaller ones (plot points and other things), but also time framing and character points. I can only recommend this, because it is a great thriller indeed!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Disappointing in comparison to original,"My wife and I went to see this movie recently, having thoroughly enjoyed the original, but it didn't really stack up very well. First of all, casting an action actor like Daniel Craig in the male lead was unbelievable. In the original, Micke is fairly awkward and Lisbeth is constantly having to bail him out of situations. He is a highly competent detective, but a bit of a nerd when it comes to physical activity.However, the two main draw backs for this film were the way Lisbeth is portrayed and the fairly wooden and contrived acting throughout. Lisbeth, in the original movies, is a strong, independent and emotionally withdrawn character. She is also quite hard to like, especially in the first film. In this remake, we hardly see her for the first hour and Micke ends up doing most of the detective work himself, whereas Lisbeth actually played a much bigger role, which is pivotal to the plot in the next 2 movies. The remake also implies that Lisbeth acted out of necessity, not out of malice towards certain characters, but her character is not that nice! She hates men who hurt women and goes out of her way to humiliate them. This, again, is essential to her character, especially for the final movie. The remake also develops the relationship between the protagonists too conventionally. In the original, it was a lot less easy for them to trust each other, and Micke actually didn't approve of a lot of Lisbeth's behaviour, whereas he seems to condone it in the remake.It seems that for the American market to like this film, it had to be sanitised and Lisbeth had to be a bit more cliché and a bit less flawed. Micke also had to be a bit tougher and more masculine. However, one of the great things about the original is that it it turns gender roles on their heads and allows the strongest character to be a woman. Sadly, this remake has reverted to the Hollywood rule that female leads should always be weaker than and subservient to their male counterparts.Verdict: a well made film with strong visuals, let down by poor characterisation and screenplay, as well as fairly wooden performances.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Rough, thrilling, and a classic mystery","I'm a big fan of David Fincher. All of the 5 films I have seen from him range from great (Se7en) to masterful (The Social Network, Fight Club). However, when I learned he was doing another version of the Swedish original based on a novel, I wasn't exactly thrilled. Having never read the novel, I could only base it on the Swedish original, and that one never rose above just good. The story sounds great, it just never left me really hooked. Fincher's version accomplished more with the same source material.The opening sequence of the film is excellent, as everyone has already said. It's the best opening of the year. Then we follow Michael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander. Very similar to the Swedish version, but also executed differently. Basically, pretty much what one would expect from Fincher, although there is a big difference. I expected a very cold atmosphere, and that same atmosphere although works can also be off- putting. Yet, while the film does have that, it also plays a lot with different colors. It's atmosphere stands out from the Swedish version's, and overall it's much more involving and thrilling. The different settings changed in the film, as well as some of the interactions and such. This version is more thrilling.Then we have Rooney Mara. I had expected good from her, and then I heard raves for her performance. Yet, I didn't really see her expanding on what Rapace did. Somehow, she's given more material to work with, and she expands on the complexities and the hidden feelings that her character has. This is an excellent performance, and she managed to surprise me with how much she does with just a still face. It's even in the small moments as well. Daniel Craig is a more investing protagonist than the one from the Swedish version, and he did more than I had expected him to. He shows many vulnerabilities that I didn't expect.One of the major differences is the ending of this and the ending of the other version. The way this version revealed the truth about the prime antagonist and about Harriet was handled much better here, but it has some problems in the final 20 minutes. After the big climax is over, it takes too long to wrap things up. Fincher's version doesn't add any ambiguities. One of my favorite aspects of the Swedish original was the way that lisbeth ends the attacker, and a conflict between how she handled it and how Michael wanted it to end. Here, all of that is removed. I was disappointed in this. Also, this version adds more to the ending of what Lisbeth is doing undercover. I thought this worked well. I have not seen the other two films based on the trilogy, but I felt that this version handled it in a good, but different way. And the final scene, surprisingly, worked. I wouldn't have thought it could if reading it on paper, but it did.Overall, this is an excellent film. It doesn't really do anything out of the ordinary, and when looked at is pretty simple and straight-forward, but in that respect it works. Many will find this structure solid, if unexciting, but it adds to the richness of the characters. I loved it for even more reasons I can't explain, and I do think it's better than the Swedish film.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Lisbeth Salander's Liquid Core,"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Fincher, 2011) concerns the interaction of two characters who are dipoles on the social spectrum. The wrapper of the mystery and acts of aggression committed by or against them serve to enamor the spectator to Lisbeth Salander (Mara Rooney) and Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig). The character Lisbeth is title namesake and hence the primary protagonist. Lisbeth is the first character to appear in the film as she engulfs the spectator in the opening credit title sequence. The primordial ink stained technological opening denotes the subconscious processing of present and early traumatic events in the dragon girls dream-nightmare life. From this point forward Lisbeth remains an enigma of feminism exploited. In the tradition of fetishism of female protagonists, Lisbeth falls somewhere between horror and pornography. She is broken up, dissected and split between the two genres as both victim and hero. The sadomasochistic aspects unleashed upon our hero have her pinned into the corner of inescapable social conformity that has been thoroughly corrupted by perpetrators of the administration. She is obviously not a nice girl and as such must be punished for her non conformity. Director David Fincher gives us this punishment beyond what we may have imagined. This added level of pure sadism inflicted upon Lisbeth and physicality of abuse leaves her character totality stripped of any humanistic element, there is little choice for her other than to curl up and die or fight for her life. It leaves the spectator with the feeling, ""well she did not deserve that!"" and questioning their own system of beliefs and morality. Reacting as a caged animal would, she lashes back at the audience in the psychic castration most feared by the phallus wielding spectator. The audience is more than elated by her resilience and exacting revenge against the atrocities committed, indeed it has been quite some time since I have witnessed such an outburst of cheers elicited from todays placated spectators. Her vengeance is not only for herself individually but for female victims everywhere. As is the trend of modern cinema, the character has become a vessel for the spectator ego-ghost, and we are given a protagonist that is a blank canvas upon which we paint.Trnet Reznor's sound-image adds considerably to the film. I especially enjoyed Lisbeth's scream/roar on the subway escalator. The NIN t-shirt plug is a little cliché. Fincher does a nice job, in Hitchcockian fashion, of building suspense and downplaying they more graphic elements as contained in the original version. It was an excellent film and Fincher is at the top of his game, although the general public still may not recognize his name as much as more celebrated Directors.Excerpt: The Ego-Ghost Theory: ""The oscillation continues between the inner (RIS) Spheres as sustained elevated duration enables reading of a complete cinematic language. The double level communication structure exists between the Ego-Ghost and the Screen Universe itself. Complete cinematic language as interpreted by the Ego-Ghost is provided in transference as a psychic imprint to the outer (RIS) Spheres of the Ego.Future trends with respect to the Cinema can be observed in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. The Ego-Ghost as inhabitant of the characters of Lisbeth Salander and Mickael Blomkvist moves beyond the screen universe. As the characters seek to solve the mystery, they, and we as their inhabitants, are drawn into the spectacle of home movies, multi frame still images, computer video media and audio-visual evidence. This spectacle within the spectacle may produce an additional level of (RIS) essentially inverting the model again and the producing a perceptive refection that the events and evidence are in effect real"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"The feel bad movie of Christmas, made my Christmas","First off, the casting was perfect. I wasn't sure if Daniel Craig could make a believable and realistic transition from James bond to an average journalist. And the most impressive factor to this film was Rooney Mara who hasn't had a good deal of limelight other than playing Erika Albright in the social network (also by David fincher). The movie was gritty, realistic, and very entertaining. With a plot that a mystery buff couldn't resist, it captivates your attention and keeps your eyes on the screen throughout all the two and a half hours you're watching. All characters show their personal pros and cons in simple ways that only add to the depth of the story and all things related. To say it all in all, the movie was tremendous and should win at least two of the Oscars it's been nominated for. It's worth going out of your way to see, because you won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
If you can't improve on brilliance why bother?,"From the very Bondesque intro onwards I felt a sinking feeling...Simply put, Fincher has tried to Hollywoodise a classic film and failed really quite horribly. Hate to think he'll be doing the other two a similar disservice.I've read various reviews from Empire to magazines - who is paying them to give this 4 stars out of five? The plot is spoon fed so you know what's going to happen from a very early stage of the film, and who the main protagonist is. It's so blatant it's incredible the script got past the final draft.Full of plot holes, the acting is lacklustre and the cinematography that people have been talking of is over rated I think.It was really very predictable that this would be the outcome - I'm a massive fan of Fight Club and Se7en but Fincher didn't cut the mustard with this.It's clearly been done for a North American market - OK fair enough - but when the original is so much better to remake it barely a year after its original release is madness.Daniel Craig doesn't even attempt a Swedish accent making him seem totally out of place. The Salander character is made too confident and in the end it was hard to really care for her because there was no background information.A seriously disappointing but expected Hollywood mutilation of a far better film by Niels Oplev.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Lisbeth Salander is the best character of the past 10 years,"The real intrigue in Millennium Trilogy starts and ends with Lisbeth Salander. As with the books and the original Swedish movies, I can nit-pick the plots and the films to death like everyone else, but ultimately, the fact that we get to see another depiction of Salander should force most people from the fans right on down to the uninformed to see this film.To that end, I think Rooney Mara holds are own against Rapace's Salander. I initially found her style a bit too over-the-top as compared to the costume design in the Swedish film, but as the film churns and we see the Salander's army/goth exterior cast alongside her feminine sexuality Fincher does justice to the curious duality of the character. And bravo, Rooney Mara, I thought she was a bit too withdrawn in the first act of the movie, but much of that is plot driven and I really enjoyed the way this film draws more on her physical desires then the Swedish version, whether those desires are for Big Macs or orgasms.The film itself is good, not great. Apart from the opening credit fiasco that made me think of the worst modern day James Bond films and felt completely disjointed from the tone of the film, I can't find too much to criticize Fincher for. His depiction of the cold Swedish countryside, the little things like the wind in Martin's home and the rough cabin feel were all pluses. The cat's role was a nice warm up and cut down the audience moment. Reznor's score is enthralling, its one of those scores where you acknowledge its power during the movie, it doesn't blend into the background, it comes at you in waves and you feel it hitting you in the face at the right times.Criticisms include the editing back and forth between Salander and Blomquist's story lines throughout the first 40 minutes of the film. I liked the idea of trying to keep the viewer constantly linked to both characters, but we were literally jumping back and forth in 30 second intervals, it felt too cut up for my liking. Daniel Craig is a good actor, I like him and I don't know another big name actor that I'd have preferred in this role, but I agree with others who lean with the original Swedish actor (name escapes me) for the roll. Craig masters the suave and broken characters in his Bond films and Layer Cake very well, but there is a certain aesthetic missing from his portrayal of Blomquist.Lastly, I had such high expectations for Fincher's portrayal of the dark, murderous, violent aspects to the film that I felt the final act and the run up to the whodunnit resolution to be somewhat sanitized.All that said, I still give it high marks and recommend it for newbies as well as fans of the Millennium Series.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
You don't have to choose,"Isn't it nice that you don't actually have to choose which version is ""better""? They're both outstanding. They're different. They have different strengths. The Swedish version does a better job showing Salander's background; the American version does a better job showing the relationship between Salander and Blomqvist. The Swedish version does a better job handling the Wennerstrom subplot; the American version does a better job handling several aspects of the central Harriet Vanger mystery.As far as the ending is concerned, neither version follows the book completely; the book's ending is a kind of composite of the two. Or, more accurately, the two directors chose to emphasize different aspects of the book's ending.Take my advice. Don't choose between them and don't waste time arguing which is better. Appreciate the strengths of each. And while you're at it, read the novel AND listen to the excellent audiobook version narrated by Simon Vance.And keep all the versions away from your kids.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
wait for it on TV,"There is nothing about this that needs to be seen on the big screen. I was unaware of the content, knowing only that it was based on a best seller.The movie is incredibly long and slow paced. The lead female is unattractive and unlikable. At times the movie really dragged, then something unpleasant would happen. It seems that some people think that being cynical, controversial and bitter equals some higher artistry. Not in my opinion. Its not exactly a thriller..in fact its painfully slow. The final twenty minutes are very tough going.There is apparently some debate as to whether the following films in the franchise will be made as the movie didn't make much money. I personally don't care if they are made or not but I hope the makers realise that some who saw this will flatly refuse to watch a sequel.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Great Movie- Captivating,"I had just watched the trilogy with the English translation subtitles last weekend, then I rented this on Zune yesterday and I think I may watch it again tonight! I don't know what it is about this movie, but it just captivates me and draws me in deep. There definitely is a lot of depth to this movie. It is odd in that just about every movie you watch at some point something happens and it snaps you out of the trance and makes you realize you are just watching a movie. From start to finish this movie has you there, deeply involved in the events.Cinematography is incredible- even thought much of it is focused on the bland harsh conditions of the Swedish winter it still was just very visually appealing.Characters/two movie versions even though I had just watched the original version I enjoyed both of them immensely. I thought I'd find myself really siding with one of the movies or the other and basically considering one rubbish and one great but I think they both are so well done that you can easily take away a good deal of enjoyment out of both of them.Specific characters. It was extremely interesting to me to see what must be a tough character to play done apparently so effortlessly and done so well by both.Story line there is a rather large difference in the overall story line for both of the versions I don't go in to detail obviously but I enjoyed both versions.I guess I am probably not the type of typical person who would enjoy these movies. I am guessing I am not the typical demographic but I really do think both movie both sets of actors did an incredible job. I can't and won't choose one over the other.I think only 2 types of people would not enjoy this- 1 is the type who just isn't in to dark movies with some really horrific scenes and the other group are those kinds of people that insist the movie must be exactly like the book (I haven't read it).Overall, I loved it and this has become one of my favorite all time movies. Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara you both really did an incredible job. I really hope you guys do the trilogy!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Probably the best mystery movie of 2011 so far,"David Fincher really took advantage of every little detail, even with the stylish snapshots and awesome direction, he succeeded in keeping the audience busy thinking of what will happen next. He transformed the simple clue in the movie to have deep ramifications to the story.The story is centered around a Sweden journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) who is hired by Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) in order to find out what happened to a woman named Harriet (she is part of the Vanger family) who was missing for 40 years. During his investigation, Mikael is aided by a young woman Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) who has psychological problems and generally unsociable and who happens to be a computer hacker.The suspects are the members of the family itself, where Mikael and Lisbeth must dig every corner of their past in order to find the one responsible for her disappearance.The more we advance in the movie, more the story gets complicated while the spectators are eager to know what will happen next, that in addition of the clear evolution of both of the hero's characters through out the movie.The acting was really great, Daniel Craig was amazing like always, Rooney Mara did a great job she presented her character like she suppose to do and even more, where she made sure that every move will look genuine and unique to her character. the rest of the cast did a real good job too with some good emotions and good acting.Overall the movie was awesome, the plot has its twists and turns before the grand finale which no one will be expecting it. So if you're into mystery-thriller movies like fracture and MR.Brooks, then you must not miss this one.9/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Fantastic,"I have always read reviews and not taken the time to actually write my own, but for this film Ill make the exception.For a fan of the books, I have seen the first Swedish film and now living in Sweden, working where it was filmed in Uppsala. I had a huge interest on how this film would reflect the book and more importantly Sweden.Without giving too much away, I think this film has done an excellent job, I have abstained from giving a full 10 due to the slight change to the ending.For me, the level of detail, subtleties of how we eat Sandwiches with cheese on the single slice of bread, the Swedish response when Mikael couldn't get a signal on his phone and much more. I loved this film and has truly put Sweden back on the map, its not all ABBA you know.Rooney Mara in my opinion played Lisbeth better than Noomi as I thought Noomi Rapace was too old. The Swedish film didn't really mention the Wennerström affair and the money, which is a major platform for the next 2 books.For a solid cast, great setting, I highly recommend this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"A superbly written, perfectly acted, as close to flawless film as you can get.","First of all, I have to preface this by saying I have not read the novel nor seen the Swedish film. Watching David Fincher's American version is my first experience with this story. Now that that is out of the way,what can I say about this film other than how this is filmmaking at its finest? Totally riveting, brilliant and captivating. From the hauntingly beautiful score, to the picture perfect cinematography,to the gripping intensity of the dialogue, and the amazing performances by all of the cast, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is one of my favorite movies of all time. It hits every beat and always nails the feelings of the characters beautifully. I loved everything about this movie. I loved the performance of Rooney Mara in particular. Wow talk about giving yourself completely to a character and film role? She did not hold back and delivered one of the most brilliant, magnificent performances of all time. She hit every beat perfectly and said so much with the look in her eyes. This movie is very dark and very disturbing in certain scenes. And this movie does not have tons of action. It relies on its dialogue and its character development, which is the strongest I've seen in a long time in a film. The dialogue is important and puts the pieces together beautifully. And when the film does have action, it once again delivers perfectly on the mark. I could say so much more about this wonderful piece of cinematic excellence but I will simply say this: one of the best movies, not only of the year, but also of all time. David Fincher once more hits the mark. This movie is not for everyone, if you don't like long movies with lots of dialogue and few action scenes and if you don't like gruesome, grotesque, overtly violent scenes-this movie isn't for you. But if you like dark films with great dialogue, haunting music, superb acting, and an overall look and feel of excellence-then this movie is for you. I can't wait to see this movie again and again. This film gets 9 out of 10 rating from me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Not as simple as it might appear,"I have now seen both films but haven't read the books. It would be so easy to dismiss the US film with caustic comments about Hollywood redoing international films for the worse, but I think this is more complex than that.The first film had flaws, maybe not of pace but of character development. This version does provide some exposition of the principles and their behaviour. But the Swedish film tells the plot better and more intensely. I remember the scenes revealing the murders elsewhere in Sweden, far better in the original rather than Fincher's which were almost impressionistic.I liked the development of Lisbeth in the final scene. It is irrelevant whether it is accurate with the books because in context it is more reasonable that Lisbeth feels something for Mikael because he doesn't demand anything of her...and entirely plausible when she reacts by throwing the leather jacket away and driving off.Fincher's film is more beautifully shot for sure. But was that worth the enormous budget and is that not the greater travesty, that the studios and the directors believe that we need sumptuous visual spectacle to follow an original disturbing story? I appreciate both visual presentation and challenging story line and plot development, but one very rarely gets it....because a true original yet disturbing story would not usually attract such a large budget.Go see this film it's not perfect but if you are so dumb you can't watch sub titles then this film might just shake you out of your intellectual torpor",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A very interesting and rewarding film,"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was a hit that fired on all cylinders. It has deep and interesting characters and a great, thorough story. The movie is very mature and can not be watched lightly, it requires full attention and will shake you will disturbia at time. However, this all attributes to the mood which is set beautifully with imagery and a great musical score. I think that Daniel Craig did a great job in a more vulnerable and educated role and Rooney Mara does a great job making us marvel and fear her character. All of the secondary characters in the movie add to an extremely complete and thought out executed movie. Overall, it is a mature movie that should be enjoyed by all, of the sufficient age.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"BORING, the Swedish was far more captivating and Noomi was a FAR better Lisbeth","I wanted to like this movie I truly did but it just can not compare with the Swedish film. Everyone has their own opinion but to me this film was lacking and I could not stay focused as opposed to its Swedish  counter part which I couldn't take my eyes off of. 1st is Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander she gave an OK performance I believe that they were many other actress that could have done a better job.  Noomi Rapace (the original Lisbeth) owned the role one of the most captivating performances I have ever seen! People say this version is closer to the book and in some aspects it is! But it's a boring movie. I'm an American I love American cinema, I don't mind read subtitles but I'd rather not have to. Believe me when I say the Swedish version has a better dialog, a way better cast and is overall a much better story. I'm sorry for the fans of this film but there was truly no need to remake this story after the Swedish people did an excellent job transform a book from their nation into film.

Commercial and forced Hollywood remake of Swedish hit,"The Girl with a Dragoon Tattoo is another best-seller title taken by US/UK filmmakers and adopted for Hollywood standards. High budget, celebrity actors and big big commercial campaign to pump up cinema views. I am a big fan of the whole trilogy and beside second part I've drown completely in the story and in the characters. Being curious of new, commercial adaptation I wanted to check by myself if all these critic's reviews aren't just another cinema campaign. And sadly I can say- they are... which is really frequent nowadays.First impression- main plan characters:Daniel Craig as Mikael Blomkvist- I didn't like him as a new James Bond for that, that he looks like and act like Russian gangster not a British spy-gentlemen and I can say that also in GWDT he lacks of a style and doesn't fit for a soft role of journalist. Couldn't really feel his pain for loosing trial, nor even his fear to die at the last scene. He really is a great fit for relentless characters (eg. Cowboys and Aliens) but not for a emotional ones. Mikael Nyqvist was much much more natural in his role.I think even Sean Bean would fit better here.Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander- gosh, when I first seen her I thought she's a ghoul. Noomi Rapace beside that she was self-confident outsider, angry on whole world, hating all the man for what she came through in her childhood- she was also dragging attention- pretty hot punk girl. Full of emotions, building interest and questions who she is. In Fincher's film- Rooney Mara looks unnatural and not attractive at all so I simply don't care (maybe it's chauvinist point of view but it is how this world works). With all this punk-sadomasochism style- yet again she lacks natural expression and her role looks a bit artificial and flat.Scenes: Like a characters- whole film looks for me artificially- I think the reason for that is that makers were following a Swedish script and were interlacing English actors with Swedish ones and Swedish world. I really would much more appreciate a brand new story based on the book but in the new realities and new world (for sure watching Swedish version strips the film of novelty). Film seemed to be a cover of a popular album- playing the same song with a new, foreign artists. All like original but without a freshness and with dose of exotic accents. Background music was really pompous and was only covering the silence. Couldn't feel that it was building emotions to the scenes.Was it worthy going to cinema then? Yes. Despite all the acting and photography, script- it's still a good movie- emotions are rather built on the investigation progress- and even if it feels like the action goes too quickly ahead (because of lack of ""interaction"" with a characters) you still feel excitement with a new discoveries. It is definitely not as good as an original and not as good as you can read on the other reviews... but I don't regret going to cinema- rather because I have seen another adaptation of very good film, not because I have seen very good film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo Review,"The Swedish original of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Dir. David Fincher, 2011), Män som hatar kvinnor (Dir. Niels Arden Oplev, 2009), methodically followed the plot created by Stieg Larsson to almost the exact word. This Hollywood remake did choose to leave out a few scenes that had been included within the original, but with the film already stretching at 2 hours 45 minutes I can forgive Fincher, as a fan of the novel, for cutting out some of the final scenes from the film.The most unusual and off-putting part about the whole film were the opening titles. They used a very James Bond-esc animation style where both Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) and Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) are born from oil. Thankfully, the heavy metal soundtrack accompanying the animation appeared to be the sort of music the character of Lisbeth would enjoy. My opinion of the film was redeemed, as for a brief second I had feared that Hollywood producers had taken control of the film and created an action filled mystery; this was not the case.Every single actor within The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo created individuals so similar to my imagination of the characters within Larsson's book that the film almost became a visual playback of my mind when reading the novel. Daniel Craig played an excellent Mikael Blomkvist but was unfortunately the only person who wasn't seemingly putting on a Swedish accent. The lack of accent wasn't that noticeable but it did make me raise questions as to Mikael Blomkvist's origin. Rooney Mara, in her protagonist debut, portrayed the girl with the dragon tattoo with such charisma that any problems I'd had with Daniel Craig's character were forgotten while she was on screen. David Fincher doesn't always produce films of a high standard, but this one is one of his greats. This movie has unusual protagonists, detestable villains and a mystery that keeps people who haven't read the book gripped till the end.The only warning I have for anyone watching this film who knows nothing about it is that it does include multiple uncomfortable scenes where at least one of the protagonists finds themselves in a situation which is difficult to watch. These said scenes are extremely well edited in Fincher's version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. They are abridged in such a way to make any of the grotesque scenes within the film more foreboding and uncomfortable. As an example, the first one of these scenes cuts between Lisbeth and her guardian in his bedroom, and a slow backwards zoom away from the door and down the corridor, making the scene more ominous than it already was.Finally, the film does extend to 2 hours and 45 minutes. For someone who enjoyed the novel it wasn't quite long enough as the final scenes within Australia have been cut to reduce time. But, I have been told, that for someone fresh to the franchise the film does last too long, as after the main plot has ended the film stretches on for 20 minutes into a detailed conclusion, similar to the book.In conclusion, this film was definitely better than the Swedish original as it had more personality, fantastic editing and a strong cast. Many will question whether there was a need for a Hollywood remake at all; and while the answer is no, I still believe that when watching this film it provides a more Swedish vibe than the Swedish one itself. The intoxicating acting of Rooney Mara keeps one engaged throughout the whole film, and despite the accent, this film has widened my eyes to the acting ability of Daniel Craig.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"A good thriller, with one caveat","David Fincher's adaptation of the intensely popular Scandinavian crime novel is quite exemplary in many respects. The sprawling story of the novel is condensed and brought to life on the screen by a very skilled scriptwriter; the cast of seasoned performers bring the various characters from the page to life very well; and Fincher's direction is as ever very, very good, which makes this a stylish and easy watch.However, there's one huge caveat to go with this review: a prior adaptation of the novel already exists, namely the 2009 Swedish version featuring Noomi Rapace. The problem with this Hollywood version is that it's not as good as the Swedish one, even though it has a bigger budget. The Swedish version already did everything perfectly and can't, honestly, be improved upon; take Rooney Mara, who tries very hard as Salander, but who can't match Rapace's embodiment of the role. And Daniel Craig is Daniel Craig; he's no Michael Nykqvist. So as good as this version of THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is, it was already done in a more authentic way, so there's little reason to watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" is brutal, dark, suspenseful, and holds many deep messages at its core. It is truly a masterpiece....","I had heard many things before going to see this movie. I am a film critic as a hobby, and I knew that the critics all loved this movie, however, many people I know who went to see it absolutely hated it. If you go to the movies to socialize and eat popcorn, then this movie is probably not for you. However, if you look for near perfection in a deep, dark, yet tormentingly beautiful movie, then you will love ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.""I always appreciate when movies are deep, and even when there is a main story, there are messages throughout about different subjects. Although this film is essentially about a murder mystery, it is SO much more than that. As you progress through the story with these characters that you become hopelessly attached to, there are many symbolic scenarios that say a lot about human emotion, relationships, and victims of violence.I know that this is a short review, but it is mostly because I could go on for weeks about how masterful this movie is. With excellent acting, a gripping story, interesting characters, and symbolism, ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" is not for the weak minded, and certainly not for people who can't see past what is on the screen. This film has made its way on my top 5 movies of all time - It sucks you in and doesn't let up, and even being over 2 hours and 30 minutes, it will leave you craving more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A bit disappointing for someone who has read the book,"First of all, why does Daniel Craig keep his British accent while everyone else in the movie does a Swedish accent? This gives the movie an Englishman in Sweden feel, instead of a wholly Swedish story feel. Maybe Daniel Craig got dropped into the movie at the last minute and maybe for that reason also, he never manages to quite capture Blomkvist properly, he's not the tired, financially ruined reporter whose career has just been destroyed escaping his problems, but he comes off as an strong, athletic, physical presence, headstrong and determined.I admit that I finished reading the book right before seeing the movie and probably for that reason the movie felt more like a PBS re-enactment of the book rather than a feature film. The movie felt like it lacked style and when it did apply style, it felt grossly out of tone. For example, the James Bondesque opening ""immigrant song"" sequence which seems hardly appropriate for a sleepy murder mystery that aims to explore themes of sexual sadism, Nazism, anti-Semitism etc.The original book is not without its faults, while brilliant in places the author filled in gaps with tripe. Nothing characterizes this more than Lisbeth which the author Larsson made into an Asperger's syndrome inflicted super-intelligent super-human. The movie version of Lisbeth is sexy and cool but cartoonish. There is no effort to elucidate Lisbeth and her actions, she just is cool and smart and that is all we get about her.Having read the book probably puts me in a different category than a large portion of the audience for the movie. While it's never possible to tell a 400-page plus novel in a three hour movie, I really wished for style and focus rather than a quick retelling of the story. It's disappointing that the movie just aims to tell the story rather than take risks and explore themes and ambiances while visually telling the story. Finally as a side note, for those who read the book, the movie version eliminates the Australian sheep station, which leads to a change in the tone of certain characters from the book.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Faithful and engrossing remake of Swedish original,"If you saw and liked the original Swedish film based on Stieg Larsson's novel ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,"" you might be pleased or disappointed with David Fincher's English-language remake for the same reason: this is a pretty straight-forward remake with few surprises for fans of Neil Arden Opley's 2009 adaptation of the same material. Even the leading players, Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, seem to have been chosen because of their resemblance to Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace.Despite its familiarity, I found this version as engrossing as the first with the cast more than equal to the challenge of bringing these characters to life. And if you're looking for a great insult to direct at an enemy, the phrase on Mara's T-shirt in one scene is a masterpiece of raunchy perfection. I think Leo the Lion, M-G-M's mascot, may have read it, too, which could explain why his roar was silent for a change when the company logo appeared on screen before the movie.Be sure not to miss the opening titles which reminded me of the opening of a Bond film as it might appear in a nightmare.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Good but Swedish version is better.,"I enjoyed this version of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"". It was a well made and well acted movie and I gave it a 7/10 rating. But I enjoyed the Swedish version more, 8/10. The Swedish version was truer to the book and a bit more coherent. The acting in both movies was fine, some great performances in both and I can't really fault either movie. I thought the American version could have been a bit confusing since they took such liberties with the book's narrative. The main character of Mikael Blomkvist in the American version was a bit less conspicuous which is a good thing since I got rather sick of Mikael Blomkvist by the end of the third book. He wasn't a believable character since he was so self-righteous and such a ladies man. His portrayal by Michael Nyqvist in the Swedish version was also underplayed, and well acted. The really big difference between the versions was the portrayal of Lisbeth Salander. She was the biggest draw of the books and the movies and her character drove the narrative for me. Noomi Rapace portrayed her in the Swedish version and was wonderful in the role. She was Lisbeth Salander to me. Rooney Mara in the American version was good but not in the same league with Noomi Rapace. In the American film she came across as a more deliberately rude, petulant little girl, like a spoiled ,rich, high schooler who did what she did to get attention and anger people. Noomi Rapace's version came across as a more disturbed person, someone who just didn't have social skills or even thought about them. In the books she was more of a idiot savant or someone who could have Asperger syndrome. She was horrible mistreated as a youth but was extremely intelligent and talented. Noomi Rapace had that down. Her most interesting scenes were as Lisbeth sitting and thinking. You could see the wheels turning. You could see her figure things out. Rooney Mara didn't have that. She just was shock value. Not that she was bad in the role but just not deep enough. She bragged more and was more out there with her personality. Noomi Rapace was very internal and disliked anyone getting close to her. She had few friends and even with them she was very reserved. It was a wonderfully intriguing portrayal. Both movies are good but if you are a fan of the books you may like the Swedish version more with Noomi Rapace's portrayal of Lisbeth Salander.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
far too long,"A bizarre movie to open at Xmas TGWTDT is an overlong adaptation of the novel. Unfortunately it follows a very successful recent Swedish adaptation which seems to have satisfied the fanbase.However given that this is a depressing and relentlessly bleak tale involving graphic non consentual sexual acts I'm not sure who that fanbase would be,Fincher is the most overrated director ion the World ( the game and alien3 are cinematic masterpieces?really??) and I had begun to resent the fact that this monstrosity has been promoted as a work of genius for over a year.The movie is painful to watch- but not in a good way. It doesn't feel like a cathartic attempt to relieve a tortured soul, more a pretentious director throwing in all sorts to live up to his own hype.The cast do their best with Mara towering above everyone else. Astonishingly this is Daniel Craig's fourth big budget flop of 2011 ( and how did this cost so much anyway?) Avoid like the plague.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Every once in a blue moon, an American version does far surpass the original.","As soon as the Stieg Larsson movement made its way to North America, me being a pop culture junkie, I was intrigued. But I hate to read. Lucky for me, of course, the three books in the trilogy had already been made into feature films in Sweden, and thus, I saw them all. And to be quite frank, I didn't really understand what all the fuss was about, as made evident by my reviews of the first three films. The story seemed choppy, convoluted and the films were far too long and seemed to drag forever.I understand now that I think a fair amount was simply lost in translationor missed due to reading sub-titled.""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" has now been remade by an American filmmaker. Although usually the kiss of death right there, well, um.Not this time.As soon as I heard there was to be a remake, I sorta cringed at the thought, but once I saw the Swedish version, I couldn't help but think it could be improved upon considerably. And the story would be much easier to follow in, you know, English. When I found out the man behind the film was going to be David Fincher , however, I couldn't imagine a remake not being anything less than exquisite. With works of brilliance like ""Seven,"" ""Zodiac,"" and his Oscar-nominated ""The Social Network"" under his belt, this film couldn't have possibly been anything less than electrifying.And I was right. Right from his signature, breathtaking opening credits.There were a lot of things about the story I had a hard time keeping track of the first time around, but I remember the film. And what Fincher managed to do was nothing short of beautiful. Staying very true to the original film, but flushing out what I can only imagine to be some of the more subtle details of the book, he has made a much more uniform film.The incredibly talented (and stunning) Daniel Craig takes over the role of Mickael Blomkvist, a discredited journalist who is hired by a wealthy patriarch to try to solve the murder of his niece forty years prior. Aided by a brilliant but troubled researcher, Lisbeth Salander, they uncover corruption that goes far beyond what they expected to find.Craig's performance is nothing short of perfect, but Rooney Mara's transformation into Lisbeth is nothing short of extraordinary. Last seen in a small role in ""The Social Network,"" the actress is almost unrecognizable as she executes the troubled character with such precision, watching her on screen is like a moving work of art, both painful and graceful. Having just captured a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress, I would be hard pressed to imagine that her nomination won't translate into one for an Academy Award as well. A nomination that I think she could have a serious shot of winning, despite the obvious upcoming inclusion of some woman with the last name of Streep.And although the rest of the supporting cast is made up of excellent performances by the likes of Oscar-nominated Christopher Plummer, Stellan Skarsgard, Robin Wright and a surprisingly strong showing for an unexpected Joely Richardson (""Nip/Tuck""), the real artist here is, once again, Fincher himself. Going against everything most American directors attempt, Fincher did not try to Americanize the film in any way. There was worry that he might water it down or make it more Hollywood-friendly but the end result is, in fact, a film that is even more violent, more distressing, and even more sexually charged than the Swedish attempt. No corners were cut, no locations were changed, no smoothing anything over to avoid an R rating. With just a slight alteration for a more cohesive ending (no idea if this ending is not in the book, or the original films ending is), Fincher managed to make the film I completely expected him to make. And then some.Yes, the film does indeed run a little long, as did the original, but with so much intrigue and twists and turns, it doesn't run so long to make you check the time. It simply manages to tell an excellent story of familial corruption, while conveying the true, intense, incredible hardships of a heartbreakingly beautiful and intelligent but violent woman who has covered up her pain in makeup and hairspray.

Watch this movie!,"Great film, Great remake. Seriously, both the Swedish version and the American version were great and so were the books, do not listen to any critics. I know good films, and I know how seldom a good movie comes along among the usual garbage that is pumped out annually, the story is refreshing, the characters are intriguing, and you end up wanting more. I believe this is a very capable franchise, and since the books themselves were so great and well read it would be very easy to give us more into the world of these fascinating characters. You may need to pay close attention to understand it, but it is without a doubt a classic, one of the few that is put out during the yearly one hundred or so crap films.

A Marvelous Start To A Marvelous Series.,"I guess there's no need to beat around the bush. I'll go ahead and say that Rooney Mara deserves the Academy Award for best actress due to her powerful, yet disturbing role as Lisbeth Salander in this film. Now, with that being said, this movie is why I go to the theater. The setting was perfect, the acting was amazing, the writing was superb, and in my honest opinion, the film clearly separates itself from the Swedish version that many (including myself) saw and loved. It's an American telling of a Swedish novel and everybody dialed it up big time for this movie. Now this is not a movie that I would take a child to go see and I would be skeptical of taking friends to see it around the holidays due to the disturbing content, but it is still beyond amazing. This movie forces you to pay close attention to every little detail when it comes to solving a mystery and the ending is not one you would expect if you had never read the novel. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo shows you the darkest side of people (especially men and I can't go into that without telling you about the film.) I can't say enough about Rooney Mara who transforms herself for this role. For those of you who are dead-set on bashing this film because you love Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth, if you let that go for a little while, you will see like I do, a film that is deserving of every single award it WILL win and consideration as one of the best films of the last 20 years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Not a take to retake..... Boring and Bland,"The 2009 version had a much better story and was far more raw, rugged, and compelling. I was incredibly disappointed by this Hollywood retake. The acting in this version was solid which is to be expected from the 5 star cast on display here. However this story really lacked by comparison, it dragged on and on to the point of boredom. In this versions its characters didn't interact into this film story much during its course. They were given little time outside of its main two characters, Rooney and Craig who interacted with each other to much. Also a lot of the elements here seemed to be cut out and were made differently. This took away a lot of the edge and mystery of the original film.I am curious on how Fincher takes the next two books in the trilogy, although with this film the original 2009 version was better.6.5 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Nordic Mystery,"I must say that I found it hard to believe that anyone would contemplate doing a remake of this movie. I found the original film to be really unique, very much like a Bergman film, in a league of its own. I read all the books and saw all three movies, all of them excellent.The Nordic feel to the movie is right in your face and everything feels really authentic. The actors are all incredible, Rooney Mara & Christopher Plummer in particular. The action is quite fast paced, with very little time to get complacent.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole film, even though I knew what was going to happen more or less. The ending with Harriet is different from the original. Stieg Larrson makes equally fascinating research for anyone who is interested in the man behind the movie.The photographs and all the research material used in the case file are excellent and add to the feel of the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Decent enough thriller but has plenty of flaws,"Not having read the books or seen the Swedish movie I didn't bring any preconceptions or my own opinions on the plot with me to the cinema when I saw this. The opening credits are ludicrously over the top - full of C.G.I. writhing figures that would be more fitting for an action blockbuster. Daniel Craig does a decent job as Blomkvist, however like the rest of the characters, we never feel that there's much below the surface. They exist to tell the story rather than to be absorbing personalities. Even Rooney Mara's Lisbeth isn't more than a well sculptured shell to hang a narrative on. I think this has more to do with the source material than the adaptation. Christopher Plumber gives the best performance as Henrik Vanger, which given his veteran status as an actor is no surprise. The plot starts off briskly and as the murder investigation gathers pace, it does draw you in. Keeping track of all the players takes concentration as there are lots of Vanger relatives hanging around to provide suspects. Lisbeth's sub plot regarding her status as a ward of the state and taking revenge on the guardian who rapes her was deftly handled but I felt it didn't add much to the overall story. Her sexual relationship with Blomkvist seemed unlikely and unnecessary though. After the vaguely unsatisfying revelation of the killer's identity (again, this is the fault of the plot source) my interest waned when Lisbet goes after the tycoon responsible to Blomkvist's downfall at the beginning of the film. This is worth seeing but not worth the hype. I suspect the 'Millenium Trilogy' books are fast paced but lack any interesting literary technique.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Flaws of US movie-making are exposed,"The US remake of ""Dragon Tattoo"" is inferior to the original in every aspect of film-making: script, acting, directing, cinematography, music, editing--even credits. Fincher puts the story together with the energy and creativity of someone painting by the numbers. Daniel Craig, with his absurdly tight clothing, registers no emotional, intellectual or sensual qualities of the male hero. Rooney Mara has the stare of Salandar, but nothing else.My wife and I looked at the original right after seeing the Fincher version on screen. Danish director Niels Oplev captured the characters beautifully, and his cast gave their characters distinct and rounded qualities. Fincher's version was also soft on Nazism compared with the original, weakening the political insights and critiques that are the skeleton of Larsson's works. Rapace makes Lisbeth as fascinating as she is in the novels; Mara succeeds in making her only weird and sullen.The cobbled-together editing and crutch-like flashbacks make one wonder why Fincher decided to disrupt the original's great flow, energy and clarity with such ineffectual modifications, modifications that sap the story of its power. The annoying, modern- mechanistic soundtrack of the U.S. version, like the oily black credits, betray a desire to say ""listen to me!"" and ""look at me"" rather than to work organically with the story. I don't see how any serious movie lover could rate this pitiable remake as worth seeing over the original.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Swedish actors Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyqvist,"Brilliant book I imagine because the original Swedish film is a wonderful though at times frightening work.

I can not allot the blame to Daniel Craig or Rooney Mara, the former who I much admire in the Bond films.

"""Soon you'll know us all too well, with my apologies""","This may not go down as one of Fincher's greatest achievements and the Swedish version may also be revered in higher regard, but there's lot to enjoy still.The performances from all involved are exactly what you'd expect, the film has top class actors, Daniel Craig, Rooney Mara, Christopher Plummer and Stellan Skarsgaard. But it's Mara's performance that captivated my attention throughout the film, she is excellent as Lisburn Salander, the troubled computer hacker whom Criag's character, Mikael, hires to assist with the investigation. She brings a quite intensity that slowly builds up as the film progresses, leading to a climax I thought reflected her whole journey in the film.The performances are aided by a solid script from Steven Zaillian. Usually this is the case with Fincher's films, think of Fight Club and The Social Network as prime examples. The cinematography from Jeff Cronanweth is equally immersive as he manages to stylistically combine the dull Scandinavian landscapes with the films menacing narrative.The films pacing is perhaps the consistent Achilles heel, particularly in the opening half of the film, but overall it wasn't a huge distractionI truly enjoyed this adaptation, Fincher is without one of the great American filmmakers there has been, while this won't stand at the top, it can still be appreciated and stand alongside others in his ever growing filmmaking memoir.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"A descent adaptation, but the Swedish version & book are better","The American version changes strange things, most likely to make it more palatable to that audience. The relationships are more conventional and less complex. The main plot is truncated, the sub plots that bolster what the point of the story is--which was to show sexism and misogyny at a societal level, personal level for the characters, and an institutional level. The book makes it clear. It starts out with stats about how many women in Sweden have been sexually assaulted. The Swedish version is better at this, this version is pretty much just a straight up mystery, rape-revenge, catch-a-killer trope, which is a disappointment.The story in this version has strange pacing as well, mostly because it wants to tie up multiple plot points from sub plots not introduced at all, or are briefly mentioned only. Some major details are changed as well, which I assume is to make it shorter despite it being pretty long already.Additionally, though it's hard to get across on the screen, I really recommend reading the book because the ways in which Lisbeth thinks is not neurotypical and I think is fundamental to her character. The movies kind of elude to it, but being in both the main characters headspace is important for the story. Again, the Swedish version is better at it than this one. This is very American. Also, why the hell aren't they speaking Swedish? They're IN Sweden. They have weird accents instead.Some weird decisions with this movie. But overall, it was decent. If you did like it, totally check out the book, though. There's so much more there. Or at least look for the Swedish version, extended or otherwise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
One of David Fincer's best!,"David Fincher did a great job with this one! I personally love Daniel Craig in every movie but I think his performance is as good as the one in the 007 series.

A trully touching story with compelling characters, very disturbing at some points so if you feel unconfortable with subjects like rape or violence towards women I suggest you take that into consideration, this movie is quite explicit. The only flaw I found is that the movie is quite long(2h 38m) and some people might find it a little slow-paced.

Great acting combined with great directing,"What would happen if you combined a Director at the top of his game making a film adapted from an extremely good book, adapted to a screenplay by an extremely good screenwriter, and then bring in three great actors to star in the film?You would have a truly great film, a masterpiece or something very near. That's what we have with The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.David Fincher's direction and vision is spellbinding, a great piece of Directing, no question. Daniel Craig is good in the film in a part that some actors (and Directors that would allow) would have over or underperformed the part. But it in a pert that called for somewhat of a fine line, Craig delivers a good performance without overreaching while leaving very little on the table. Craig stars alongside Rooney Mara and Christopher Plummer.Mara is absolutely great and shows a depth that complicatedly takes an understanding of the craft and the delivery thereof.Then there is Christopher Plummer, an absolute gem in this film as he is in so many films. I still say he can act as good between only the bottom of his chin and the tip of his nose than many competent actors can act with their entire being. Plummer can take what would appear to be a simple conversation scene with Daniel Craig over tea early in this film and somehow make it a masterful scene that College Drama teachers end up showing their class as of how to act, period.This movie is a must see, for all of the above reasons.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

The girl who bored me...,"Fincher's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo suffers from the same inanimate feel about it as did Panic Room from 2002. And although both attempts were admirable, it does seem that Fincher needs more intricacies in the subplot and less obviousness in the screenplay than both Panic Room and the film in review had to offer.As it is, the film just barely manages to make you care about a tale involving a wrongfully convicted journalist and a female hacker who looks too preposterously edgy/angry/victimized to be anywhere near believable. The multiple stories they tried to cram into one film, which probably is the fault of the source material, seems highly incompatible. Either make a film about the brutalized and haunted life of a young woman, or make a whodunit.By the time the two main stories came together, I had lost all hope for the film to become less derivative and kooky. Even the soundtrack by Reznor felt completely fake as it was a mere echo of his previous work on his Oscar winning score for the Social Network. Really nothing in this film concealed the true intentions of the producers with the box office revenues in mind.In this, the film is every inch as bad as The Mysterious case of Benjamin Button in which Fincher also managed to thoroughly overproduce a flimsy idea with no real interesting story behind it. It's time Fincher made a new deal with Andrew Kevin Walker and create another Se7en. Being a producer's wife is a sore waste of his amazing talents as a director.51/100",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

This is my favorite David Fincher movie,"The story follows James Bond as he attempts to solve a murder mystery on a island with the help of Rooney Mara (I couldn't think of a role everyone would know her from). The story is filled with suspense, character development, a rich world around them, and disturbing scenes that are unforgettable.While Gone Girl follows a great murder mystery too, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo's performances stuck with me a little bit more. James Bond was amazing with the dark character he portrayed, along side Rooney Mara it combined to gave way to some great scenes. The two made every scene intense and interesting as they sucked you in.The camera work, as per usual in David Fincher movies, is amazing. I can't really describe the cinematography without rambling on, so just watch it and you'll know what I would say.The soundtrack is amazing!

Worthy adaptation with a fantastic Lisbeth Salander,"As a reader of the original novel, I wondered if I should not watch the Swedish adaptation first, rather than what I figured would be an Americanized, dumbed-down, and sanitized remake, the likes of which we've seen all too often in the past with other foreign movies. I was very pleased to see my concerns were completely unfounded.Rather than a remake, this is more like a new adaptation of the modern thriller classic. A faithful one it is, too, set in the original Swedish locations of the novel and with characters speaking and acting much like their original literary counterparts. Even the controversial decision to speak in pseudo-Nordic accents is one I actually approve of. I liked the results.Particularly great is the talented Rooney Mara, who looks a little like Natalie Portman but, while not having the same fame or level of recognition, may be just as good an actress. Her Lisbeth Salander is probably *the* character that was going to make of break this film and thankfully, it is a resounding success: she is very much the blunt, complex, riveting girl you picture when you read the book.Though Mara's magnetic performance in many ways supports the film just fine on her own, she is helped by a strong cast in which Plummer and Wright, in particular, shine, while Skarsgård, Richardson, and Craig also more than hold their own. The music sets the tone wonderfully, while the pacing and editing are also strong points, with 2,5 hours flying by.As for the story, as I said, it remains faithful to the original while trimming down some of the excess baggage and taking a couple of actually satisfying shortcuts, improving on some of the slightly groan-inducing aspects of the book. However, some of the richness, depth, and mood of the novel inevitably get lost when translated to film, preventing this very good adaptation from becoming a classic.(+) The story is faithfully adapted to the screen.

The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) - A moment when the filmmaker peaks his tradition,"The girl with the dragon tattoo (2011) film is based on Steig Larsson's swedish novel and this is the unforgettable adaptation by David Fincher.Rather than studying the plot I would like to discuss the film makers tradition of film making.In summary the film reflects journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Played by Daniel Craig) who is aided in his search for a woman who has been missing for forty years by Lisbeth Salander, a young computer hacker (Played by Rooney Mara). The film was nominated for five academy awards and won one academy award for best achievement in film editing.The both acting performances of lead actors were considered amazing and Rooney Mara was nominated for an oscar for her performance as Lisbeth Salander, The Girl with the dragon tattoo.Now in this discussion on a film maker peaking his tradition in his 2011 film, The discussion on his films in a chronological order will give a more broader perspective on tradition.David Fincher's debut film Alien 3 was supposed to be a great moment for him to establish himself in the industry. But unfortunately it didn't work out for him. I discuss these factors in my MovieFreak blog years back. (2012 - July)But he then created one of his best films Se7en (1995), The Game (1997), Fight Club (1999), Panic Room (2002), Zodiac (2007), The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2011) and Gone Girl (2014).Many or all of his films after Alien 3 are his own films that has a distinct iconic DF or David Fincher signature style.His films in a sense of thematically most of them studies psychopathy and the dark nature of humanity and it's macro level impact to society.His few films take a different approaches.His ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008)"" was considered an amazing poetic and fantasy fused film with reference to the american history and culture with a perspective of a singular individual. Rather than dark themes and the dark atmosphere DF creates films with his unique technical competence which is editing and cinematography. Like ""The Big Fish"" (2003) where Tim Burton fuses his tradition while ""Forrest Gump (1994)"" by Robert Zemeckis this DF's singular fictional american story.""The Social Network (2010)"" is the story of ""Facebook"" may be his best film after his masterpiece ""Fight Club (1999)"" in my opinion.Now this article is about TGWTDT(2011). This is a unique film on the darker aspects of human life with reference to the characters discussed in the summary. But like I said since many films of the director are based on the elements of human darkness and he specialises it through acting, editing and cinematography. The greatest technical competence of DF is his use of CGI and TGWTDT (2011) is his greatest film where you can't determine what is real and CGI because he made sure it to be that cool.And also thematically film maker becomes more and more symphonic in his artwork and in his tradition through heartlessness. And darkness not with atmosphere but with characters and he has peaked it in this film is quite amazing.

Shameless remake,"As much as i respect, and in fact appreciate David Fincher's work, this film was really disappointing.This film is disrespectful to the people from Scandinavia who really did a great job with the adaptation of Stieg Larsson's books. And disappointing because i expected a different and necessary adaptation, once this is a film made shortly after the Scandinavian.Excellent interpretations from almost everyone in an extraordinary cast. But scene after scene, the feeling of déjà vu is intense and unfortunately accurate. All the key scenes are desperately similar to the ""older"" film.If there wasn't the other film, this would be a masterpiece.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Another great thriller from Fincher.,"Wow, I'm stupid for never seeing this movie. I mean, I've only owned this movie for about 2 years now. Being a Fincher fan, I already knew what to expect. Great direction and editing, a haunting score, gritty atmosphere, interesting characters, good script, this movie had it all. The film did a great job at balancing the narratives between both lead characters. In the first hour the film was edited with great style and direction; allowing the viewer to slowly piece together the motivations of both characters. When the leads finally meet, the plot reaches a whole new level of intensity.Simply put, this was a crazy good detective movie that was very well-paced. Fincher's brilliant world-building and direction really elevated The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo to be one very thrilling ride.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Intense,"David Fincher did yet another incredible job. I have to say that this might not be his best work, but it sure is one to watch. The movie is amazing in so many ways. For instance, Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara has such an incredible chemistry and they were perfect for this film. They both portrayed their characters in such manners that made you feel and live with them throughout this journey. The cinematography was also amazing and I ought to say that this was one of the best parts of the film. Then, the writing and direction were almost flawless and you could totally feel Fincher's presence. The soundtrack was absolutely astonishing especially in some key scenes throughout the movie and it made everything so much better as it was very intense and pure. Also, I would like to point out the fact that the opening credit sequence was without a doubt one of David Fincher's best, as he manages to capture your attention from the very beginning and also to introduce you to the fictional world. Overall, I would totally recommend the movie as it is not only a great thriller, but also a film which makes you want more!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

I hope the book is better.,"A journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) is fed misinformation and publishes this, which leads to a jail sentence. This brings him to the attention of Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube). Henrik is receiving packages from the person who probably killed his niece, Harriet. Therefore, he hires Mikael to track down and find out what happened to Harriet. With piles of old data and Mikael is still stumped and does not know where to turn to find the answer. He gets his help and answers from an unexpected source Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) a girl with the appearance of a punk rocker and bearing The Dragon Tattoo.The only social redeeming value of this film is now I have learned how to cuss in Swedish. I also took notes on things I did not know you could do. I do not consider myself a prude however I believe this film was excessively graphic for the telling of the story. The film is very slow-paced and makes you want to have the type of player that you can listen to when it is in fast-forwarded mode. Also, there is an annoying background theme that plays over and over and over throughout the complete film. The film does stick to a generic formula, throws in the standard red herrings, and twist at the end no big surprises but it is what we expect.For people interested in media I watched the Blu-ray version only and it has an option for English voiceover. The voiceover is easier to follow but sounds like a voiceover being read.

"U.S. version does not do justice, go for the Swedish version","If you are going to watch The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo film, watch the Swedish version that came out in 2009. The Swedish version is much better, with a good plot development and character development. If you go for the U.S. version expect to be bombarded by Coca-Cola and McDonald product placement. It's pathetic that U.S. audiences have to endure all this advertising. The U.S. version also seemed to add all the very violent and sexually-exploitive scene without developing the plot. The Swedish version has better suspense. Also the U.S. version did a horrible job of developing the story of Harriet. In the end I can't believe I paid money to see this movie again, as the U.S. version was truly of lesser quality than the Swedish version. Also the U.S. version was a bit less gory and sexually explicit.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Better than the original!!!,"For so long Hollywood has bungled up foreign films, but they got it right with this one.
I saw the original, after seeing this, and was disappointed at how the lead female role looks more like someone dressing up as a goth for Halloween. Not only that, but the character, can't seem to do anything on her own, without the detective alongside.
Whereas, here, we see and believe Rooney Mara to be the character. A character, that is a loner and troubled. Mara deserved that Oscar nomination, and in my mind, outperforms Daniel Craig. Damn shame the studio bailed on the sequel with Mara. This film has been the highlight of her career, so far.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Excellent suspense movie and true to the book,"There a very few movies made based on a book that hold true to the story line.

The authors can take their time to dig deep into the characters of the story, the movies have less time, a lot less.In this case we do not get to learn a lot about the characters either, but we do get to have a glance. The casting is done right, the acting is very good, and the director, David Fincher, has done a great job of fitting various pieces into his silver screen version of the book and still evoke the same feelings in his audience. Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara are excellent, and the supporting cast is not far behind. This is a complex plot, so make sure to watch and follow it very carefully.

Not comparable to the original,"The film is well made, Fincher is a good director, what jars strongly in my opinion in this remake, is seeing 007 in the role of a modest and peaceful journalist and Mara cannot even remotely compete with Noomi Rapace for the role of Lisbeth. Rapace embodied the discomfort in her gaze and was infinitely more believable in the things she did than Mara who looks like a Sopor Aeternus cosplayer. For the rest, it certainly can't be said that Fincher doesn't know how to shoot, but his past as a video clipper sometimes resurfaces and this film, compared to the original, has a sort of basic patina that makes it less dark and disturbing than Oplev's work. In short, I saw it once and I didn't feel the need to see it again, while I think I saw the original at least 30 times, as well as the sequels.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Great adaptation and a wonderful piece of filmmaking,"Rooney Mara nails her portrayal of Lizbeth and this is one of the best work on cinematography I've ever seen. The ability to make the movie ""dark"" without it actually being dark was impressive. I liked Rooney's portrayal of Lizbeth better than Noomi's.When I heard that they're doing another movie without Rooney Mara as Lizbeth I felt they killed the series. The idea that a movie can make 10's of millions of dollars over the budget and be considered a flop because it didn't make the ""experts"" expectations of what it should make is a Wall Street model that has no business in movie making.

very poor..don't bother with the sequels,"I didn't have any advance warning about this film's subject or story. Rented the DVD from the local store after seeing Daniel Craig on the cover. There seems to have been a deliberate attempt to mislead Bond f ans into watching this. The title sounds like a Bond movie (its very different to the original book title)and the title sequence is like something out of a Bond movie. Actually the title sequence for this is far better than those of the last few Bond movies.Unfortunately after the titles it deteriorates quite rapidly. The early parts of the film are tedious and seem to take forever.The character played by Daniel Craig looks terrible. He is too old to wear trendy ""fashion victim"" type clothes. he looks far better in tailored clothing like the suits in Casino Royale or the beginning of Dream House.Its difficult to comment on the story. Its basically a murder mystery that I didn't care if it was solved. The running time is too long and the film should have ended before it did. There are moments of great unpleasantness but very little positive to counteract them.I don't have any interest in a sequel and I think Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara have far better things to do than make more of this trash.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

The acting and score (by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross) stand out to me as brilliant, which is not unusual for movies directed by David Fincher. I am not saying this film is without its flaws, but most of my criticism is minor and could end up being considered dumb to some.

"Exciting stuff, but a sadly missed franchise opportunity","I hadn't seen this in years, but I saw it a few times and I've always wondered why this wasn't the big hit everyone expected it to be. Looking at it now, it is a bit long, not sure if this is the Daniel Craig people, at that point in time, wanted to see and the ending is a downer that clearly needed the sequel that was never filmed due to that box office. Whatever it was, it's a shame as this is exciting stuff due mostly to David Fincher's strong direction and an astonishingly good performance by Rooney Mara. To the best of my recollection The Social Network was the first time I saw her. When I saw this with a friend and it was over, I asked him if he knew where we had seen her before and when I told him he was shocked it was the same person. Since then, I've seen her give fine performances in a number of things and this transformation will always be some sort of amazing. She is fantastic and I would have loved to have more. This story of a disgraced journalist being hired by a wealthy man to see if he can find out anything about his long missing daughter. The male lead in this mystery is played by, of course, Daniel Craig and he does a good job and plays it correctly, but I'm not sure if someone else would have been better, though I did like his and Rooney's chemistry. The supporting cast is good, especially Christopher Plummer. The cinematography is excellent and the music sensational. Rooney has some strong and harsh scenes in this. They aren't pretty, but man, they are effective! The film's not perfect. Again, it's a little too long and there is some disconnect among the cast about accents. It takes place in Sweden and everyone seems to have a different take on how to deal with this except Craig who doesn't even try. Odd that a director as strong a Fincher would not have a better handle on this. All in all though, this is an exciting film, but that ending! More was needed. Eight years later some others tried for more, but it was a critical and commercial failure and in that case, I was glad of that.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A trademark David Fincher mystery thriller that works despite mediocre twists.,"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) :
Brief Review -A trademark David Fincher mystery thriller that works despite mediocre twists. Many of you might guess what the twist is or might already know because of the novel-in both cases, the twist doesn't hold much shock value. That's the problem with many David Fincher movies-at least for me; you might differ. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo also suffers from the same issue, but it's a damn gripping thriller. Running for almost 160 minutes, the film provides no loo breaks. Some trademark Fincher brutality is present to make the film look more intense, more realistic, and more hard-hitting. The rape scene of a girl, her revenge with a dildo and tattoo, and then her consensual sexual encounters with her girlfriend and the protagonist (I couldn't determine whether she was lesbian or straight)-all contribute to making this a modern, brutal thriller. That's one way of keeping the audience hooked, according to Fincher's methods, and it has worked most of the time for him and the audience. The second method is creating a gripping and intriguing narrative, and this film has both. It's a freaking intense world; there is no comedy or light moments. Fincher never believed in making a child-friendly film, and with such concepts, I think he was right. It's just that the conclusions for the killer and the disappeared girl don't seem mind-blowing. When you make a mystery thriller, you must ensure that your climax has terrific shock value. The film misses that one point, while the rest of the show is simply unmissable. Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara deliver brilliant performances. I also didn't appreciate how Lisbeth started dreaming and then was hurt-both elements were out of context. In this script, there was no space for love or feelings since it was a goddamn filthy world, and every main character had dirt on their shoulders. Nevertheless, David Fincher has done enough to make this film enter your watch list, and you shouldn't miss it.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"""May I kill him ?""","This overlong. Emotionally restrained yet too graphic film is not all its cracked up to be. The main character - the troubled Lisbeth- comes across to me as almost creepy and not really nice to look at. On the plus side the acting overall was good and suited the atmosphere of the movie. Maybe here and there we could have gotten a bit more character development though. I found this one to be a bit gratuitous with the sexual situations- in another era Alfred Hitchcock would have come up with more clever and subtle hints- Here, the audience just gets clobbered with the violent carnality. This left me emotionally numb.Multiple stereotypes are used, which is just the director taking the easy way out... The copy I watched may have had an audio issue so the reveal near the end was mostly unintelligible- I had to go online to look it up. But I suspect the same thing happened in the theatres for some people, some movies have moments where the dialogue is not well enunciated and this is one of them, at just the most critical point too. I found the truth about the missing girl to be quite a stretch, thus wrecking my suspension of disbelief. Btw, we barely even get to see the 'tattoo,' its just a blur, so the title does not even seem to fit.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Another Fincher Masterpiece,"Just saw a sneak peek of the film and couldn't recommend it more.When I walked into it I never expected what I got, this is the best adaptation of a novel I've ever seen.Most of the characters themselves capture the essence of Larssons novel perfectly, but Rooney Mara's portrayal of Lisbeth Salander is Oscar-worthy. The woman perfectly captures the dichotomy of the tortured, vulnerable soul with the calculating, sociopathic tendencies embodied by the character.I wouldn't want to reveal anything else, but for fans of the novel and for fans of good film in general, this is a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"American vs Swedish, two very different movies for different audiences","I can't help but wonder if my opinion would be different if I had seen this version before having had watched the Swedish one. Perhaps I would have liked this version more than I do.Tonally and stylistically, these are two different movies. Undeniably, the sound design, set design, and general ""style"" is much nicer in Fincher's version. I thoroughly enjoyed it as a watchable film. I can see why most people prefer this version. Some things that irked me are some very obvious mpaa issues the film maker had in censoring.However, a compelling unraveling slow-burn mystery, this is not. Watch the Swedish version to feel more like you're following along with the characters and how they all develop over time. Fincher's version feels much more fast pace, things just happen without much buildup. I suppose that quality makes it feel more spontaneous.I'm not saying one is better than the other, but they are two very different movies.- - Which One Should You Watch? - - - - -Watch the American version for a faster paced and digestible film with lots of eye candy and extremely good sound design.Watch the Swedish version if you love to unravel what feels like an actual mystery and growing to love the characters slowly over time as you discover along side them.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Open your mind to David Fincher's Dragon,"To the Book and Swedish Film fans, If have the ability to forget the book AND the Breathtaking performance of Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander in the Swedish version of the movie you will ABSOLUTELY LOVE this adaptation. I'm a HUGE fan of both but was able to quell the inevitable comparisons and in doing so I was treated to a movie experience not equaled since The Black Swan. David Fincher's version is beautiful, haunting, disturbing and altogether brilliant. And Rooney Mara does an excellent, EXCELLENT job as Lisbeth Salander.

Oscars,"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. WOW!! Watched it 3 times today. After all the simple layer movies over recent years, how refreshing to see such intricate and layered plots mesh seamlessly but subtly coercing the viewer to put forth the effort to really pay attention.For me, I'd have to back 10 years since I saw a movie this good (A Beautiful Mind). The snubbing of it for Best Picture at the Oscars vs. The Artist is as outrageous as Apocalypse Now in 1980. The snubbing of Rooney Mara vs. Meryl Streep in Iron Lady is as outrageous as snubbing Crowe for Denzel in 2002. Granted Denzel is great, but not against Crowe on that day. Granted Meryl is an all time great, but Iron Lady can't compete with a new type of character never seen before in cinema, and made very believable by Mara. This has happened before when movies are made specifically to win someone an Oscar, i.e.- Streep in Iron Lady, Denzel in Training Day, and Nicholson in As Good as It Gets vs. Mark Wahlberg in Boogie Nights which is a very similar scenario in which a never before seen character is made believable by a young actor.

A formula whodunit cake sprinkled with intrigue and an unexplored better storyline,"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is essentially a whodunit layered by a story about an investigative journalist getting his professional dignity stripped from him and then reaffirmed. It's central focus being that the title character Lisbeth, is a bad ass never back down girl who is stuck in between a rock and a hard place and performs several lewd, violent, and otherwise ""bad"" acts in order to get what she wants. Where the movie loses its center is in emphasizing the seemingly usual whodunit plot line that is the heart of this story, but not its soul, which lies in the personal stories of its characters.Before the bad stuff, let's talk about the good stuff. The stories of Lisbeth and the whodunit are both crafted superbly. While I can't say either of them are different or challenging the mainstream craft of these types of story lines, it doesn't change how visceral the scenes within are. I don't want to give anything away, but I want to say that there are a minimum of three scenes in this movie that made my skin crawl and my seat feel physically uncomfortable, but in a great way that only movies can manage. Note: This movie is really not for the weak of heart.Both lead actors do well with their roles. Lisbeth is brought to life in every blank stare and movement, yet something about the whole character seems very statue like, I can't figure out if it's good or bad, but it was believable in any case. As for Daniel Craig, I've enjoyed his turns as James Bond, and this role is like a less secret agent version of that role.In all reality I look at this movie and I believe that what's been done here is very good, possibly the best film of this year, but I would assert that that statement is not saying much. This has not been a great year at the movies.However let's address what I was alluding to about the heart of the movie and the soul of the movie. Where the movie spends much of its filming genius and storyline is in the whodunit plot line. Intricate set pieces with perhaps one too many family members and flashbacks and pictures all lend themselves to a formulaic mystery plot line that serves as the driving point of staying with the movie. However, before starting that plot line and for about the last thirty or so minutes of the movie, that's not what this movie is about.While the movie spends so much time working the whodunit, several other more interesting things have happened and eventually happen that get skated over because the biggest part of the running time was spent on David Fincher's version of noir, without all the pulp that comes with the cop drama. Just about every moment of the film that doesn't have to do with this central theme has more interesting elements, but none of them are spent with much time, its almost like they were put in the movie just so people couldn't point and say, ""You left this this this and this out of the movie when they were in the book,"" but they are thrown together so fast and recklessly that it leaves me wondering if the book truly skated over these plot points with such abandon or if I have to go read it to get what feels like the actual story.The biggest issue comes from its central characters only participating in the whodunit because there in lies something they want. For all the time the film spends making Lisbeth a bad ass new age woman that gets what she wants for herself, they spend a lot of the film showing that she really is just a dressed up girl, who makes her self out as a vamp. None of this is more painfully shown than in the last shot of the movie, which I'll let all of you experience for yourselves.While I like this film, something about it is just unbalanced from the story perspective. Why in a story rife with intrigue into the inner ties of corporate leaders and secrecy and shadows and computer hacking type activities must the plot butter up the seen a thousand times whodunit and skip the icing with the stories centered around these overarching elements? It doesn't make sense, and I firmly believe this film misses something from the book. Maybe I am wrong about that, but it makes the film seem unbalanced in that aspect.And yet it is a good film. I will give it an 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"Rooney Mara carries the whole film, and wow does she carry it well.","Everyone had their pick of who they wanted to play the Lisbeth Salander in the American remake if The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, there were slot of really big names and a lot of great actresses who came very close to bagging the role, but Mr Fincher did the right thing and chose a little known actress who had the acting chops to make this difficult role something memorable, it must be said that Rooney Mara is phenomenal in this movie, I would go so far as to say that she out does Noomi Rapace, which is saying slot because she was also amazing in the original.Remakes of foreign films are either hit or miss, sometimes they can change it too much and it is just lame, or sometimes they can stick to closely to the original and it seems kinda pointless, this remake however is pretty much perfect in sticking to the story but bringing it's own little bits and pieces to it that make it different, it's pretty much the exact same storyline and all important scenes are almost identical, it's just the right amount of same and different. Daniel Craig is rather good as Mikael Blomkvist, but he really us no match for scene stealer Mara.Sweden is shown in all it's freezing cold glory and it's presented in an equally inviting and non inviting way, im glad that Fincher decided to keep it set in Sweden and not transfer it to America, it wouldn't have the same vibe if it were any different. Another awesome thing about this film is the epic opening credits, your eyes and ears are attacked by dripping tattoo ink and Miss Karen O's screeching voice, it's truly epic and sets you up for the film you are about to watch.Fans of the original and fans of Fincher will be impressed, it is a worthy remake of an already excellent film but it also stands as a film on it's own.

Not as Good as Original,"I was excited to see Finches version of this fine movie. I was extremely disappointed after watching it. The acting was good...but I must say the script treatment was not as sophisticated as the original. It seemed not as smooth as the original and a bit forced in some places to get the story to flow faster. It suffers from the same sickness as most Hollywood remakes of already good movies...the sacrifice details in favor of shock, but such is the stuff of McMovieland. Everything about the movie was acceptable and on par with the original EXCEPT for the script treatment. You remember Let the Right One In? Hollywood remade that one too and to me it sucked compared to the original. Both remakes lack the ability to emotionally connect me to the characters and their goals.

It's a Finch for King David to always direct a great movie! And Rooney Rules!,"I wish I could start my review of David Fincher's ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" as riveting as the film's infamous ""Immigrant Song"" opening. But I am foreign to those type of stellar intros unless there are plenty of corny puns on the menu. Many, including yours truly, thought there was no need to make American versions of the 2009 Swedish film franchise which was adapted from Stieg Larsson's best-seller Swedish novels. But since it would have the Fincherprints of the master auteur David Fincher, I thought maybe it would turnout alright; and it sure did! At least, the first installment did. David Fincher's version of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is simply one of the best films of 2011. For those of you who are not familiar with the premise, I will ink it for you. It is about a disgraced Swedish journalist named Mikael Blomkvist who gets hired by a wealthy Swedish geriatric billionaire named Henrik Vanger to investigate the 40-year-old mystery of the disappearance of his granddaughter Harriet; her case was unsolved and her body was never found, so Vanger wants someone to do a bang-up job and finally solve the mystery. Henrik is even suspicious that someone from his Vanger familial bunch was responsible for Harriet's disappearance. In return, Blomkvist gets mucho cashola and undisclosed information from Henrik about the corporate magnet that Mikael has been trying to pin for many years. So how does that chic with that dragon pic in her skin fit into the picture? In mucho ways! Lisbeth Salander is the name, computer hacking is the game, and her Gothic fashion is not lame. And by the way, you don't want to make a sexual move on a first date with this Salander Girl, or else you will be sorry; just ask her monstrous welfare officer Nils Bjurman. I will just leave it at that, and if you have not seen it, I will be hush about Lisbeth's vengeful show on not-Nine Inch Nils (a little kudos there also to Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails and movie composer pal Atticus Ross for another mesmeric score to a Fincher flick). Lisbeth who knows all about Blomkvist due to her hacking ways, eventually teams up with him to try to solve the Harriet disappearance. Fincher's well-tuned directorial techniques were very pulsating throughout the Tattoo picture, and Oscar-winning screenwriter Steven Zaillian's Tattoo scribe read very well in its verbal intercourse. As much as I loved the Fincher and the Zaillian's labor efforts to the Tattoo, my favorite contributor to this movie was that of Rooney Mara's tour-de-force starring performance as Lisbeth Salander. Let's just say that Rooney Mara was a giant among scene- steelers throughout the movie. Daniel Craig's performance as Blomkvist was spectacular and there is nothing to libel about that sentiment. Christopher Plummer turned out another great performance as Henrik Vanger from this now Oscar-winner veteran thespian. The steady Swedish actor Stellan Skarsgard was stellar as Harriet's brother Martin Vanger. Kudos also goes out to Robin Wright's right-on work as Blomkvist's lover and boss Erika Berger. And this Joel has to commend a Joely of course; because Joely Richardson turned out a genuine supporting performance as one of the Banger women, Anita Banger; say Anita Banger five times real quick; just saying. I see now why Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall picked up yet another Best Film Editing Oscar in a Fincher movie; because just from the film's opening, you know they were going to be immigrating to the Oscar stage. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" might not fully- capture you in its initial viewing (especially if you have read the novel or seen the Swedish film version since you know what is going to happen), but this Fincherpiece will stay in your mind and there is Mara of where that came from. ***** Excellent",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Given the challenge of adapting Larsson's novel, it's a strong thriller","Be prepared to have your annual ""movies are never as good as the books"" conversation with family and friends, because Stieg Larsson's worldwide best-seller ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" has come to theaters (this time without subtitles).Wanting to honor the beloved source material, Sony placed this American version in the hands of serial killer mystery expert David Fincher (""Se7en,"" ""Zodiac"") and Oscar-winning writer Steve Zaillian (""Schindler's List""). The move pays off, because ""Dragon Tattoo"" is about as good as it possibly could be given the challenges of the adaptation.The multi-faceted story deals primarily with Mikael Blomqvist (Daniel Craig), a journalist being sued for libel who temporarily steps down as his magazine's editor and quietly accepts an offer from a retired businessman named Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer). Under the guise of writing Vanger's memoir, he is to investigate the unsolved mystery of Vanger's missing/presumed dead niece, Harriet, a case over 40 years old. In need of help, he comes across Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a strange young woman with expert hacking skills who passionately takes up the job due to her own troubled past.Much like its Swedish predecessor, this adaptation strives to pack the bulk of the novel into a ""reasonable"" runtime without boring its audience to death. Zaillian compresses the hundreds of complex details of the cold case at the film's epicenter into easily digested chunks, yet merely having to do so always produces no better than satisfactory results. Oddly enough, saying the script doesn't derail the film or damage the story and its characters is the highest of compliments one can pay it in this case, and that's what it does.But it's Fincher who elevates this film, with no offense intended toward Niels Arden Oplev, director of the 2009 effort. Fincher is a master of his craft, and that means a considerable amount when dealing with a film so densely filled with plot points that other elements (like character development) can get lost.Although no adaptation of this novel could possibly convey the lengthy passage of time and the obsessive nature of Blomqvist's search for the truth, Fincher provides an abundance of tone, especially in reflecting the frigid temperatures of northern Sweden. He and his ""The Social Network"" and ""Fight Club"" cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth make it so every golden ray of sunlight on the desolate island feels as warm as it looks. Only directly blasting cold air on you from the back of your seat a la a ""4D"" theme park attraction would be more effective.The film's editing job is also top notch, overlapping audio and video to smooth over the exorbitant location transitions and maximize suspense in the scenes that cut back and forth between Lisbeth and Blomqvist. In fact, the movie finds its best groove in these scenes.Also crucial to depicting the book are the issues of graphic content, namely violence and sadism. After all, the translation of the original Swedish title is ""Men Who Hate Women."" Fincher embraces the book's sexual and disturbing nature as evidenced most basically in the marketing campaign. He also doesn't shy away in the film's most difficult scenes, giving them the brutal and sordid edge they require to honor the message of Larsson's novel. Although it feels wrong to call them tastefully done given the subject matter, it's true.Mara's performance mirrors Fincher's vision in many ways. There's no expectation of pity for Lisbeth, yet neither is she a hollow shell who completely bottles up her feelings. She bares it all in this film in every sense, giving herself to the performance. Rather than ham it up a notch to get some Oscar attention, she sticks with her interpretation of the character and makes for a rather unforgettable Lisbeth Salander.Craig is also a perfect Blomqvist, though his character lacked something distinctive, perhaps due to the script not giving him many moldable moments. A similar fate befalls many of the characters, which just emphasizes the need for Fincher's work and the talent of his actors all the more. Stellan Skarsgård as Martin Vanger, the current CEO of the Vanger Corporation, does perhaps the best job of utilizing his screen time to create a compelling character.""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is a busy movie, and understandably so. Larsson's story deserves its integrity preserved the way it was in this version (only minor omissions and one major change), even at the cost of something that could have been more emotional and moving. Putting the book down and looking at this as a mystery/thriller, it's a consummate offering for the genre. Those unfamiliar with its source material will find it a bit slow at points and not as clean as a thriller written directly for the screen, but will still enjoy the payoff thanks to the professionalism of Fincher and Zaillian.A book and two movies later, rather than saying ""the book is better,"" it should be said that ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" thrives the most in its original novel form. Some books lend themselves to film better than others — this isn't one of them. Given this movie took it out of its ideal state, its a good thing it turned out how it did.~Steven CVisit my site! moviemusereviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"A Twisted Sister, Rebooted, Re-envisioned, and Reviewed","The film is highly recommended.Many have questioned the rationale to remake this film. After all, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo was a well-made successful foreign film just two years ago, appearing on numerous best film lists. Did it really need to be redone? Too many subtitles? Too graphically violent for American audiences? Too much of a European sensibility? Too much of a cash cow to ignore?Rather than go into any of the detailed plot of Steig Larson's popular novel which most people already know, I decided to list 10 reasons for its existence:1. The director is David Fincher. No one does creepy better than this talented filmmaker. ( Think back to Se7en, Fight Club, and Zodiac to remind you. ) His films have shown a prurient bend in the past and he is a gifted director whose films have a diverse cult following. Fincher's visual tricks carry with them his unique style and he can say more without words than most directors. So this film treatment suits him to like a leather glove ( pun intended ).2. It stars Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara. The diverse coupling of Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander now is embodied by these two fine actors. Craig has the less flamboyant role as the journalist reporter and plays him with a dogged but world-weary spirit. . Mara plays out Lisbeth's rage in a fearless and bold performance. She also manages to hide the character's vulnerability beneath the sexual and emotional scars left by conspirators and powerful men in general. These actors' strong chemistry elevates this version to a slightly higher degree of excellence due to their credible and realistic portrayals.3. The mystery still involves its audience. Did a family member kill Henrik Vanger's niece, Harriet, who disappeared almost 40 years ago? Blomkvist and Salander investigate and go on a convoluted journey to solve the case. These damaged individuals need to unravel the mystery as they begin to trust each other and tend to their own personal issues. Just as before, the initial story takes its time to have the characters converge and their subplots, while explaining their motivations, do little to advance the on-going mystery and subsequent investigation.4. The supporting cast remains strong. Christopher Plummer, Robin Wright, the superb Stellan Skarsgard, Joely Richardson, Steven Berkoff, Geraldine James, and especially Yorick Van Wageningen all do yeoman-like service in their respective roles. Their casting is spot-on and the actors take special pleasure in defining their roles.5. There are some minor changes in both films. Some minor characters are missing in the American film and some flashback actions are merely mentioned rather than shown in the English language version. Both films have a different visual sense, with Fincher's film less conventional and more edgy and hyper-kinetic. Also, the Blomkvist role seems to be more expanded in this newer version and the romantic pairing of both investigators has been augmented and feels unmerited with its gratuitous moments of nudity. The film's ending differs from the novel also.6. The sexual content and violent nature of the film is on the edge of a NC-17 rating. This latest reincarnation is more graphic in sexual content and violent overtones than its Swedish predecessor. The camera seems to linger on Mara's body and exploits the actress, which became completely disturbing at times. However, that Mara / Salander connection yielded a veiled discomfort for the moviegoer, adding to the sinister subject matter while stressing the objectification of women in this society.7. The film boasts an innovative score and a clever use of pop music. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross create a dissonant and effectively soundtrack which adds so much to the visuals on screen. Their use of sound effects melding into the musical background heightens the tension. ( One misstep: the title music by Led Zeppelin in a 80's music video opening credits that is too reminiscent of a James Bond flix, failing to capture the film's more somber tone by choosing a stylish high fashion biker chic. One smart move: the use of Enya's new-age song, Orinoco Flow, to underscore a particularly unsettling and memorable moment in the film's climax. )8. Technical values are top-notch. As with Fincher's other films, his creative team never fails to astounded its movie-going audience. The cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth, editing by Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall, and the production design by Donald Graham Burt are exemplary.9. There's nothing on television right now except reruns and marathons of vintage series. Enough said.10. We need an adult violent mystery / thriller to celebrate the holiday season. With so many films being family-oriented fare this December, it's refreshing that adult-oriented films are still available to view to a more discerning moviegoer. This film dazzles in its shocking content and its full- frontal assault on the viewers.Voyeuristic and racy, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo has a takes-no-prisoners attitude. The violence is brutal and twisted. It makes no excuses for its sensationalized story and boldly stays the course. ( Be forewarned, the film is not for the prudish or the squeamish. ) The 2011 version has been visually updated and efficiently rebooted with only a slight improvement over the excellent Swedish import.

Captures the tone,"Although I've read all three of the books (structurally, they're really 3 installments of one big honking novel), I haven't seen the Swedish movies. Forget about the books. Forget about the other movies. On its own, this adaptation does manage to capture the general tone and resonance of the novels, and it does this with admirable brevity and to-the-bone editing. There is a bleakness in the novels that is nicely encapsulated by the exterior and interior backgrounds. Snow. The sterility of Martin Vanger's modern house on the hill. The cool patina of years on the old cottage's walls, furniture, and stonework. The camera dwells on Lizbeth Salander's inexpressive face and you can almost hear her complex gears spinning away. The lighting director in this film is a genius -- and so is the cinematographer -- emotions are relayed in light and shadow so well, and the camera angles nudge our tensions without being overt about it. It's not perfect, of course. No movie version of a well-plotted novel ever is. But it strives to do the story justice, and manages to accomplish its task.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The Year's Best Remake of a Recent Swedish Film,"The Hollywood version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo offers few surprises for the seasoned viewer of the 2009 Swedish original. Yes, it has come to the point that we can't wait long enough to rip-off foreign markets. To its credit director David Fincher manages to inject the compelling mystery with his auteur pizazz, though the Bond-esque ink laden title sequence may have been overkill.Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) is a magazine editor on the verge of financial collapse after losing a libel trial. When an assignment appears before him to investigate a murder from 50 years ago, with an enticing offer of the dirt needed to clear his name, he takes it. With the help of an eccentric investigator by the name of Lisbeth (Rooney Mara), Mikael finds himself investigating not one murder but a series.At some point studios are going to figure out that Daniel Craig is not the answer to their casting problems. Here, he's too cool under pressure. I'm no magazine editor, but I don't figure that they handle being kidnapped like James Bond would. He hardly seems bothered.Rooney Mara mutilates her hair and body for this role, receiving more piercing than I'd care to describe. Her accent is highly authentic, more so than Craig's to say the least. I'm not a fan of how she has decided to sell out her body for realism, but Mara does have the most genuine performance of the film.Because of her unorthodox appearance, it can be troublesome for an audience to root for Lisbeth. To accomplish this she's put into a compromising situation involving rape, to which end we can take joy in her revenge. It's an effective tactic, but I question the nature in which she is exploited, making for a largely anti-male narrative. Not only that but The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) makes the same lazy circle as the 2009 film. Random acts of violence happen in the real world, but in a movie the unlikely is frowned upon. When a thief damages Lisbeth's Macbook Pro, she has to see he newly appointed guardian, a sex maniac, and trade services for an allowance to have her computer replaced. So ultimately she ends up back where she started, she had a laptop, and now she has a laptop. This choice makes a nearly 3- hour movie. In fact an entire film goes by before Lisbeth and Mikael meet.The discrepancies between this and the 2009 Swedish films are few until the mystery is solved. As the movie struggles to conclude we find a flashback that has been nixed, replaced by a brief aural tale. Fincher then moves to resolve everything presented in the first half, so Lisbeth becomes a busy girl following up with friends and doing favors.I wasn't crazy about the 2009 film, but I certainly respect it. I can't find myself respecting a blatant cash-in regardless of its individual merits.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Great movie, this is NOT a remake","Loved the movie, and I have read all three books and seen the Swedish versions. As one reviewer already mentioned, I wanted to clear something up: this is not a remake, but an adaptation of the book. People take away different thing from the book, hence why the movies have slight differences. Its fine to like one over the other, but reasons shouldn't be 'it's an American remake.' Both films took away different parts of the book, which on both films, can be disappointing. However, the book is written so in depth that some cuts had to be made. People cannot compare or say how Lisbeth is portrayed between the films without knowing her character in the book. Side note, I could have done without the beginning. A little too stylized for me. However, the performances were brilliant. And the score was great. This movie makes me want to watch seven again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The Swedish Version was WAAAAY Better,"A lot of story was left out. I don't know how people who haven't read the book or seen the previous version made sense of what was going on.The graphics are better and the Trent Reznor music was a plus. But it really lacks depth. The director basically ripped off the other version and added more special effects. That's it.I also didn't really buy Lizabeth's character. She is way to angry, much more so than she was in the book. She did actually have relationships with other people (hacker's, her lesbian friend etc).Read the books. They are amazing. You don't even get the back story of her relationship with her father, brother and why the Vangaurds are really even interested in Bloomkvist. That and they showed an unnecessarily graphic dead cat.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Everything I hoped it would be after reading one of my favourite books!,"There was such a high expectation of this film after being so enthralled with the book. I found that the book had so vividly conjured up strong images of both characters and locale that it might be disappointing in how it was portrayed in film. So it was very refreshing to see such a great book so well translated to the screen. The casting was superb, each character very much true to the portrayal represented in the book. Even though the book had a high shock impact with the violence and sex, it was very sensitively and well presented. In addition, the filming of Stockholm city centre and the Swedish countryside was beautifully captured. Although a longer-than-average film, I never found myself losing interest. What was cut and edited from the book was expertly handled, without losing anything of importance. Even the few changes to the book were handled well. I now look forward to the next book being filmed!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
One word : Masterpiece !!,"This English-language adaptation of the Swedish novel by Stieg Larsson follows a disgraced journalist, Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), as he investigates the disappearance of a wealthy patriarch's niece from 40 years ago. He is aided by the pierced, tattooed, punk computer hacker named Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara). As they work together in the investigation, Blomkvist and Salander uncover immense corruption beyond anything they have ever imagined (plot).What is hidden in snow, comes forth in the thaw (Great Tagline!), I was really looking forward to The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo ever since I learned that David Fincher had been attached to, First i didn't see the Swedish version or read the novel, so i can't say if this film best than the first version, or the adaptation was best than the novel!, so i will talk about what i saw in ""Fincher Film"".About the film, without a Spoilers words, I completely loved it, I usually like thrillers and mysteries, but this one is even better. It's not only thriller, it's also drama and the characterization is strong and it shakes you all the time along. The plot actually contains two story lines, Vanger family and Lisbeth Salander, which eventually clash together, and each is fantastic by itself. Story is intriguing, it doesn't back out one bit from telling the ugly truth and it doesn't even soften it. It says straight in your face everything you need to know. With no sugar-coding at all.Now the Acting : I want to say about this movie is Rooney Mara's performance, she knocks it out of the park portraying Lisbeth Salander, she captured the mystery, the strangeness, the darkness, the out-of-the- norm personality that this character had. She was absolutely fantastic, she was really great and when you see her expressions you will feel her in the darker parts of this movie, which we'll get to in a moment, Daniel Craig is great as usual and there is great chemistry between him and Mara. Christopher Plummer, as little as he's in the movie, does a great job as well, in fact all the actors do. This is a really well acted movie.David Fincher has put his trademark darkness to fantastic use. Whether its sweeping shots of freezing, snow covered Sweden or wonderfully eerie interiors Fincher creates an unsettling atmosphere that is unrelenting and technically perfect. With Fincher i've learnt to expect a beautifully shot film and this is no exception, within this film are some of his greatest images. Regarding the disturbing nature of some scenes, Fincher is wise enough to show them in all their horror but doesn't stop to linger or exploit.Finally, this film is absolutely amazing, it does in my opinion, despite speculation, the movie moves at a break neck speed from the beautiful opening sequence, wonderfully reminiscent of Fight Club all the way through an astonishing piece of movie making to the end, definitely on of the best in 2011, stop thinking and when you see Fincher in the poster what ..what do you expect from him?Masterpiece.5/5",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"A Beautifully Shot, Well Acted and Totally Absorbing Thriller","The brutal violence of ""Se7en"", the complex intelligence of ""Zodiac"" and the gripping style of ""The Social Network"" are only the tip of the iceberg in David Fincher's ninth feature film, ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"".As an avid reader of the novels and original Swedish adaptations, I was skeptical of the American ""remake"", but although the original Swedish adaptations were well-acted, especially from Noomi Rapace, they suffered from low budgets that prevented the lavish production on display here.Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross's score is haunting, suiting the feeling of the film perfectly, as does the ominous cinematography of the cold Swedish countryside. Rooney Mara is outstanding as Lisbeth Salander. She is fierce, original and, on rare occasion, insecure. Daniel Craig is impressive as Mikael Blomkvist, while Christopher Plummer is first-rate as Henrik Vanger.""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" is a captivating film that will have you on the edge of your seat, whether you've seen the original or not. The shocking up-front violence will surely turn some viewers off, as will the 2½ hour running time.

I am very excited to read the books as I am to watch the rest of the trilogy in theaters. I cannot get enough of Lisbeth, I think she is one of the best characters created in literature or film.

Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig form an interesting and unusual pair in this thriller based on the book by Swedish author Stieg Larsson.,"Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig form an interesting and unusual pair in this thriller based on the book by Swedish author Stieg Larsson. There is a lot of exposition at first, since the characters are new and their lives complicated, to say the least. And frankly, at just under two and one half hours, I would not be a proponent, but this film is an exception. The background of the characters, especially Lisbeth's, is required to understand the darkness of not only the family being investigated, but the investigators themselves. The depth of Lisbeth's darkness can be seen in the way she deals with a purse snatcher in the subway, and with the abusive state appointed clerk who administers her funds after her guardian is hospitalized. Christopher Plummer is superb as the retired industrialist who only wants closure to the disappearance of his granddaughter, an event he might have put out of his mind except that every year on his birthday he receives the same gift she gave him before she disappeared. Stellan Skarsgard gives a wonderful performance as the incompetent grandson who is ruining the company, and Joely Richardson is magnificently understated in her role. Perhaps the most impressive player is Daniel Craig, who continues to astound us with his range and depth of ability. To transition from the hard, emotionless Bond to this role is a total reversal of character, but one we have seen before in Defiance and Lara Croft. Craig, I believe, is the next actor to be added to the list of phenomenal performers like DeNiro, Hopkins, Pacino, and a scattered few more. Lastly, Rooney Mara impresses me with her ability to remain detached yet empathic in this role. Overall, this film is a wonderful peek into the dark underbelly of the human condition, and a must see for fans of Hitchcock, Craven, and the other masters of horror who have gone before. Rated R for graphic violence, rape, torture, language, and sexuality, I would hazard to say this film belongs in your collection if you are a fan of the detective genre.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"David Fincher's new adaptation of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is a near-flawless mystery/thriller...","I suppose I should star this review by saying I have never read Stieg Larsson's original book, now have I seen the previous trilogy of films adapted from his ""The Girl..."" books. I came into this film open and willing to accept it as it was- with no pre-conceived notions, nor anything to compare it to.Director David Fincher (Fight Club, Seven, The Game, The Social Network) delivers this new adaptation (not a remake of the other film, but rather a fresh adaptation of the novel) of the neo-classic book. Starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, with some outstanding supporting roles from the likes of Stellan Skarsgard, Robin Wright and Christopher Plummer, this film is an exceedingly strong and well-crafted mystery with some shockingly strong hints of suspense and even at times horror. It is an expertly crafted tale that has just a few minor flaws keeping it from getting a perfect 10 from me.Craig stars as Mikael Blomkvist, a disgraced journalist whom has just lost much of his savings in a libel case against a powerful businessman he accused of having criminal ties with in his newspaper. Trying to get out of the public eye and lick his wounds, he accepts an invitation from Henrik Vanger, a wealth Swedish magnate, to come stay with him and help him solve an elusive mystery of who murdered his grandniece. Blomkvist is pulled into the mystery, intricately tied into Vanger's demented family (itself made up of recluses, distrusting people and even former members of the Nazi youth and German Army), as he searches for clues as to the girl's true fate and murderer.At the same time, Lisbeth Salander, a brilliant but deeply different and troubled young woman (Rooney Mara), whom was hired to perform a background check on Blomkvist, faces her own series of heart-breaking obstacles, before she joins Blomkvist to solve the mystery. More on Mara later.Fincher's direction is absolutely outstanding. From a solid (but flawed) script by Steven Zallian, Fincher is able to craft a dark, Gothic, brooding but still somehow beautiful and touching scope for the film. The visual direction and Fincher's choice in shots are expertly done, and he does throw in a few insane shots in the vain of his former classics like ""Fight Club"". (Mainly in the insane and jaw-dropping opening credits, a nightmarish and ""oily"" montage set to disturbing techno-like remix of ""Immigrant Song"")The acting is uniformly perfect. Craig is outstanding as Blomkvist and delivers a stunning, layered performance. Skarsgard and Wright make for compelling supporting roles, and Plummer is absolutely magnificent and will evoke tears as an old man who merely wants peace with his one big regret in life.Rooney Mara, however, is a revelation. Her portrayal of Lisbeth is absolutely stunning. I almost cannot describe it. I had seen Mara in several other films, and she was completely and utterly unrecognizable. She inhabits the character in a way that is impossible to fathom- she isn't acting- she IS Lisbeth. I am flabbergasted that she didn't win an Accademy Award for the role. I honestly cannot believe it.This praise being said, the film isn't perfect. As mentioned, the script is fairly flawed. I suppose in that adapting the novel for film, it was extremely hard to fit in all of the major characters and moments. So the film does feel a bit over-stuffed, even at about 150 minutes in length. It could have used another 20 minutes just to slow down the pace, because often I found myself unable to keep up with certain moments. While most people generally complain about what could have been cut out of movies, I think this is a case where the film should have been longer.In addition, there are some small problems and aesthetic flaws to the film. While the score (courtesy Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross) is haunting and breathtaking, at times it does overpower the images. In addition, even as a mainly American production, it is hard to keep up with conversations at times with all of the foreign accents, names, references, etc. I'm not nit-picking, either. Some of the smartest, most cultured people I know couldn't understand the dialog at times. (I even know a few foreign people who couldn't tell what was being said in certain scenes) They could have taken a bit more care to mask some of the more exotic accents and language. Finally, Fincher is perhaps too subtle with the mystery aspect of the story, and during key revelatory scenes, I couldn't understand what was happening.That being said, this is a near flawless film. I am excited to see the two sequel books being made with the same cast (particularly the stunning Mara), and I have since become more and more interested in the books and the original film series.I give ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" a 9 out of 10. Outstanding.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A good atmospheric film that did not balance well its two sub-plots,"Overall I liked the film but I have some reservations on the way the plot progressed. My main objection is that the major storyline was not self-contained: the film tried hard to merge two rather unrelated sub-stories that did not have too much in common. On one hand, the crime story with the disappeared woman and secondly the personal struggle of Rooney Mara's character (the girl with the Dragon Tattoo). Furthermore, her relationship with Daniel Craig's character was not convincing and was not given a proper build-up.Despite the good acting and the eerie atmosphere of the crime subplot the movie suffered because of the above. To his credit, David Fincher, being a capable director barely managed to salvage the film. A 7/10 from me.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A handsome but quite pointless adaptation.,"Your appreciation and enjoyment for this film mainly comes down to whether you buy into the story or not and whether you are you a fan of the original book (I should probably say books, since this is the first part of a trilogy). Unfortunately my answer to both questions is quite a drastic no: I know I am going to be quite unpopular with this statement, but I've never really fallen in love with the book and I in fact just don't seem to be able to find the appeal for the actual story itself. I find it quite derivative, exploitive, contrived and a bit heavy-handed to be honest. These exact same problems are translated (in fact even enhanced) into both film adaptations. It's probably unfair to draw comparisons with Niels Arden Oplev's 2009 version, but also unavoidable. There are of course similarities, but given the fact that David Fincher is directing, the US version is a lot more slicker and cinematic. It is also closer to the original book in many places, but, as always in condensing it all into a movie, it has lost some of its more polemical thrusts from Larsson's story and some of the details which made the characters so compelling. All for the sake of the actual crime/mystery plot (which let's face it, it's pretty bland for today's standards and brings very little new to the genre). So in the end, not only the film suffers from the same problems of the book but by shrinking it all it has lost some of its more subtle subtext too. I am not really saying anything new here: what works in books doesn't necessarily work movies. For example, the film spends a long time setting up the two main characters who don't meet until a good hour and 20 minutes into the story. And yet despite all this time Daniel Craig's character is just as elusive to the audience as it was at the beginning. That is an ongoing problem with Fincher's movies. His usual cold approach to film-making and detachment from his characters makes it always very hard for anyone to empathise with anyone on the screen. Craig does bring some unexpected charm and a slight sense of humour to his character (something which was completely absent in the previous version), but it's really not enough to make you care for his character, let alone for making you want to watch him again for the next couple of sequels (Fincher has recently announced his interest to direct both sequels back to back But no official announcement will be made until this one get released, of course). It's Rooney Mara who really steals the show here (well, let face it, so did Noomi Rapace in the previous version. It's a great part to play!). This is one of the performances of the year and there will certainly be nominations and awards for her coming left and right over the next few months. She even manages bring a certain realism to an otherwise over-the-top character by convey both fragility and an incredible strength, sometimes with pure simple looks. However, did we really need that 1 hour and 20 minutes of preparation before these two characters meet? Did we really need to see the infamous rape scene? Yes of course, it's that rape that gives her the motivation for wanting to solve the crime, but why couldn't they just convey that with a quick flashback? Why was the audience allowed inside that room watching not only the rape but also her revenge to her rapist? Wouldn't it have been just as effective and less exploitive if we had been left outside the door, maybe listening to the screams? The problem is, if you take all that preamble out of the equation, you're actually left with very little else because let's face it, as a mystery this is a fairly derivative film. As I said, these are all queries with the book and the story itself . Given the material Fincher has probably down the best he could. This is a handsome film, with some solid acting (Plummer once again is at his best!) but in the end you're left with a sense of ""so what?"". I couldn't help feeling that everything that Fincher did in this film, he had already done it before. The dark tones of Se7en, the seedy and multi-layered atmosphere of Zodiac, the dark ominous music (if we can call it that) by Trent Reznor from The Social Network. Finally it's probably worth mentioning the impressive ""James Bondesque"" title sequence (again, Fincher has down beautiful title sequences before) to the notes of the cover version of ""Immigrant Song"" by Led Zeppelin which I found absolutely mesmerising and yet somehow seemed to belong to a different film altogether. In the end this film adds very little to the previous version, aside from giving us the wonderful Rooney Mara, and certainly adds nothing to what I already know about David Fincher. I just look forward to seeing him handling a script and a story worth of his craft, because I do believe he's one of the best directors out there right now Moviegeekblog.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Fincher Style to Spare, But Terrible Material","I've not read the book on which David Fincher's newest movie is based, and after seeing the adaptation I certainly don't want to. For it's obvious, even to someone who hasn't read it, that Fincher and company are fighting an up-hill battle against borderline terrible material.That material is all about perversion, sadism, torture, murder, and it's particularly occupied with all of the horrible ways in which men can victimize women. It's the kind of story in which the serial killer gets caught and then delivers a lengthy soliloquy directly to the main protagonist so that the audience can be bluntly told what the writer wasn't creative enough to tell us in any other way and another character can swoop in in the nick of time and stop the serial killer from killing our hero.But Fincher's talents as a director are considerable, as are those of his cast, and the film is pretty entertaining up to a point. But it goes of for far too long, there are one too many story lines, and the material becomes too preposterous to bear. What the film has going for it is the performance of Rooney Mara, sensational as the titular character. Though the film treats her character like crap, Mara herself is hypnotic and carries the film, no small feat given that she by no means has the most screen time (that honor belongs to Daniel Craig, also very good). The incessant violence against women is hard to take after a point -- the story isn't smart enough to make any commentary about that violence, so it just comes to feel uncomfortably gratuitous.One bit of unequivocal praise I can offer this film -- I doubt I will see as kick-ass an opening credits sequence in any other movie this year.Grade: B",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Avoid at all costs,"If you have read the books (which I highly recommend you do), you will most likely hate this film. Major aspects of the story are changed, including the ending which is entirely different (for seemingly no reason other than to reduce length of the film) to the book - and this itself causes a huge plot inaccuracy. Also, we are given a significant clue as to who is the murderer very early on in the film. What is the point!? The character of Salander is destroyed by the director. She opens up way too much and shows a significant amount of emotional weakness, which we shouldn't see until the next film at least. The film artistry itself is hugely lacking. We are under the illusion that it is a film of incredible beauty and depth. I'm afraid not, this is just the Swedish countryside - possibly the only good thing about this film. We are soon met by lack-lustre screenplay writing and subsequently unnatural and contrived scenes with every character. I'm not easily offended but the unnecessary use of swear words (where no normal person would use them) and lengthy portrayal of rape and sex in this film was just not called for. It is awkward and a huge indulgence on the director's part. Stick with the original Swedish version if you want good, solid, artistic film making. And please stop praising this blasphemous nightmare of a film.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
My opinion: US vs. Swedish,"OK. This movie was awesome. Go and see it now!My opinion as far as the Swedish version vs. the US version: The US version is superior. The Swedish version was made on a ""made for TV"" budget, and this one has the big budget in addition to top-notch actors and a top-notch director.Believe it or not, my only complaint about the US version is Daniel Craig. It was hard to accept him as being so helpless in some scenes. Plus, at one point he is having a hard time hiking up a hill and he states that he is really out of shape. That's kind of silly in a movie where the very obviously in shape Daniel Craig does a sex scene a few minutes later. His performance wasn't bad, but they should have done more to separate him from his Bond image. Any scene where he is wearing a suit, it is fitted just like Bond. I think a more ""frumpy"" wardrobe would have helped....And Rooney Mara owned the role of Lisbeth. She had some big shoes to fill after Noomi Rapace's performance in the Swedish version. She was equal to the task. Both were really good in the role, but if I had to choose, I'd say Rooney was slightly better. Her performance was a little more emotional, and her younger look really sold the character.Storywise: there's not much new here. I've heard that this version is supposed to be closer to the book (which I have not yet read), but there wasn't much difference here to make me believe that.If I had to point out one thing I liked better in the Swedish version, it was Lisbeth's parole officer (or whatever he's called as far as Swedish law goes). The actor was just a much creepier fellow in that version (in my opinion). The dude in the US version was good and he sells it. He's just not as good by comparison.Overall: see this even if you loved the Swedish version because this one is just as good, if not better.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

It goes without saying this movies isn't for the weak minded or those who do not want to be shocked at what they are seeing. It's pretty graphic and inexplicable, but that made the movie interesting.

Great adaptation: faithful and powerful,"WAY BETTER THAN THE FIRST ADAPTATION I was amazed that people thought so much of the original adaptation. It was clearly not a good movie (caveat: I saw the TV version in two parts which is longer than the movie but still feels rushed and disjointed). Whatever you think of that Scandinavian movie you can't seriously say the main character, Mikael Blomqvist, was magnificently embodied. The actor had zero charisma, he felt so boring you couldn't buy he was passionate about his work (and women - and in turn his sex appeal was questionable). Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander was good but not great and you could feel it was for lack of top-class directing skills in the Danish film-brewer.FAITHFUL TO THE BOOK Actually the first book in the Millennium trilogy is such a good thriller - it is really a top-tier page-turner that deserved to become a best-seller - that the story (featuring Lisbeth Salander as the most engaging character) is enough to have people feel they are watching something original, thus good.Stephen Zaillian's adaptation really does justice to the book and we really have to congratulate the producers and director David Fincher for not shortening significant parts of the original story. At over 2h30 the story is never slow, neither rushed. Most importantly Daniel Craig is a perfect Mikael Blomqvist (and I admit I don't like him as 007), Rooney Mara feels more fragile than Noomi Rapace and is thus much more touching.I am not a great fan of David Fincher but now his visual gusto is matched by great scripts (well, he earned that through lesser works I think) he does wonders. Clearly here you can tell the production sense and values were perfectly in tune with the original material, plus Fincher shoots the perfect pace, the perfect emotional tone as he directs Craig and Mara (and the supporting cast as well) to hit the high marks.Sole big blunder: an over-bloated and totally out-of-line opening credits sequence. This is not a super-hero movie or a saw gruesome horror flick: clearly here less - much less - would have been more. Credits displayed over an extended presentation of Mikael Blomqvist (possibly thru Salander's private eye) would have been way better. The fact is the only unfaithful bit is the English title (chosen by publishers) but there was really no urge to make it that explicit so soon in the movie.Now I am expecting a lot from Millennium II - The Girl who played with Fire. The book was boring, long digressions and obvious suspense with a multi-pronged investigation stalled for pages. Here the movie can even be better than the book, too bad they didn't shot it back-to-back with the first movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"If you like S/M porn, you will enjoy this","Wow, what a disgusting movie. In the theater where I saw it, there were families with children 3, 4, 5 years old .... In my opinion they should get free obligatory tattoos saying ""Lousy Parent"".The person I went with had read the book and so understood the story. I think the movie-makers did not bother to make a story that actually fits together and that the viewer can understand. The movie is just an excuse for showing gross scenes.Key things that the viewer needs to know were not mentioned in the screenplay. At the beginning of the movie, one of the main characters is convicted of libel, but we don't know whether he wrote a true story or not. At the end of the movie, the screenwriters may think they told whether he was vindicated, but I don't think they did explain it -- whether this was on purpose or by writing an incoherent script I'll never know.Also, the second primary character is a whiz at hacking computers, but the screenplay doesn't mention that until about halfway through the movie. If you read the book, you know that she is a computer hacker, but you don't need to see the movie; if you didn't read the book, you are in the dark.During the opening credits the viewer is treated to incomprehensible visuals which have nothing to do with the plot or with any of the characters. What's with that?Finally, I'll avoid giving any spoiler, but the main question raised by the movie is never answered in any way that makes sense... you simply cannot tie the pieces together... the script does not contain a story that could actually work out as the writers show you it did.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Good, but unnecessary remake","The original (2009) movie version of the book was gripping, stylish, and original. This version, while adequate, adds nothing to the original. Hollywood's mania for remakes of everything notwithstanding, it is difficult to see why this movie was remade at all. The film only differs from the original in that it offers a laughably cheesy intro filled with meaningless MTV-style graphics and a ludicrous version of Led Zeppelin's already overblown (but great as it is) ""Immigrant Song"". The score, by Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor and partner Atticus Ross is better than average, but this minor addition does not justify remaking a million dollar movie.

Solid and well-crafted Whodunnit Suspense Thriller,"When you make a remake of a movie version of a well-loved book series, you're going to upset some people. Normally I wouldn't be interested in seeing something so far removed from the original, but the reviews were so good that I decided to give it a shot, and I was not disappointed. This is a very solid movie.It is difficult to take a book with the complicated relationships of Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and turn it into a comprehensible movie script, but I think this film succeeds. Is it 100% faithful? No, many details have been left out. Does it need to be? If you feel a movie's first objective is to be a 100% accurate reproduction of the source material then this movie is a failure.If, however, you feel that a movie should stand and fall on its own merits and should be its own experience then I think this movie succeeds. Daniel Craig's persona lacks a bit of warmth which I think his role needs to engender Lizbeth's trust, but that is my biggest complaint.Having seen the movie, you will not have read the book. But you will have seen an intelligent, well-crafted re-imagining of the original.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Kind of a decent by-the-numbers mystery caper,"David Fincher in recent years has grown to become one of America's best known directors working today. He has an interesting, oftentimes dark visual style that he features, and usually he has an interesting story to tell. Unfortunately, in this film, the story is just not interesting enough. It's kind of a typical murder mystery film, with some twists and turns, and an ending that really isn't too shocking. What raises this up from being completely mediocre is Rooney Mara's performance as the title character. Otherwise, this story here doesn't have enough weight or originality to stand out over other pretty good mystery films.Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) is a journalist who's fallen out of favor after possible slanderous reporting. He is called upon by Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), the ex- CEO of a company, to solve the mystery of his missing and presumed dead niece who disappeared 40 years ago. He ends up being partnered with an anti-social computer hacker, Lisbeth (Rooney Mara), who uses her skill and research to help solve the case.Mikael and Lisbeth (""The girl with the dragon tattoo"") don't meet up until halfway through the film, and the first half features them each working separately. All the scenes in the first half of the film focusing on Lisbeth are very interesting. While Mikael gets immediately thrown into the main story, Lisbeth is given almost a character study (that furthers along the plot) for the first half of the film. Rooney Mara is really great here, giving the character layers, with such understated acting. The character is emotionally disturbed and apparently ""crazy"" but any trait is hidden beneath this straight and unflinching face. Daniel Craig's character, on the other hand, is not nearly as interesting, and for some reason, he mumbles here a lot, so he's also hard to understand at times. The mystery he's trying to solve is interesting conceptually, but visually it's often hard to convey excitement when he's sitting alone reading up on research.When the characters finally meet, about 75 minutes into this 160 minute behemoth, the mystery story gels a bit more, mainly because Daniel Craig finally has someone interesting to interact with. Where the film is lacking is largely in the story. The revelation at the end as to the connections of murders, and potential villains aren't that interesting. The resolution of the film must take darned near 30 minutes, and the main thing I took away from the film, was what a great performance Ms. Mara gave, and what an interesting character she played. The plot is by-the-numbers mystery, and the film does at times drag. David Fincher's direction is alright, but he doesn't make researching the murder much more than mundane. He throws in a few disorienting movements of the camera's placement, but other than that, this doesn't feel like a really great David Fincher directed film. It feels more like an O.K. mystery thriller, that has a great performance, some tense moments, and overall just kind of slips out of one's memory after a while.This film isn't bad by any means, it just doesn't have enough going for it to make it anything more than somewhat generic, other than the character of Lisbeth. It is overlong, though not bloated, and really not a lot could have been cut out without either cutting the story, or getting rid of good character scenes. The mystery is sort of interesting, but not nearly engaging enough. The final scene in the film was very good however, and mixed character development with a sort of sadness, giving the film a bittersweet feeling. The title character basically saves this film, and rises it above mediocrity, though not quite enough above.My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 160 mins. R for violence, sexuality and brief nudity.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Disappointed,"DisappointmentWell, first of all, I didn't expect too much but, still, with the rating that higher then the Swedish version, I was surprised of how mediocre American version was. I was disappointed by almost every aspect of the movie. Even with the photography. As English is not my first language, I'll be brief. Craig – better than I expected, yet too polished. Nyqvist was so much more convincing Mara – boring, with just two tones of voice through entire movie. I suppose, this monotony should convince us that she was cold and unattached, appearance – OK. For me, Rapace was Lisbeth. Skarsgard – exceptional Storyline – didn't like the changes (compared to the book) and hated the rhythm as it kept too many details from the book; as a result, the movie looked like a photo album, hopping from one picture to another in fast pace. Directing – anemic Music – OK at the beginning, then irritatinghurting my ears. To conclude, if I had seen it before the book and Swedish version, it would have been OK. As it wasn't the case, I shall remember it as unconvincing and redundant. Then again, it's just me",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Shocking but enjoyable,"I had not read the book, but I had expected the movie to be quite violent in its treatment to women.

Very good but couldn't touch the Swedish version.,"When I first read this book I found it slow going and long. Even after reading half of it I didn't like the confusion or the slow pace. At 3/4 I began to like it and by the time I finished it had grown on me. Although not a well written book it was filled with detail that a movie maker could use to craft what they wanted into the picture.When I saw the Swedish film I was really impressed. It was a little confusing but much better than the book. The photography was interesting and bright and helped to let the viewer focus on the complex plot. The acting was really good and it was surprising that none of the characters were particularly attractive. I expected the English version to be much less realistic and it was but that's OK. We imagine ourselves as the characters and are used to Hollywood. The shocking scenes of nudity, homosexuality, rape, sadism, bondage and torture are brutal and I'm not sure if this isn't the most shocking to the sensibilities of any movie I've seen in my life. It stays with you long after you watch it and doesn't make me want to go visit Sweden anytime soon. I'll never think of it as the land of Elke Summer again. On the plus side I was really amazed at the quality of acting, photography, editing and overall movie-making in the Swedish film. It's not just at the top of foreign films it is comparable to any non special effect American movie.The American version I expected to be even better. I thought it would show the superior expertise of writers here portraying the complex plot in a more understandable manner. I thought there would be more effort shown with the pace of the movie and all the areas that we excel in because of the huge sums of money we put into our films. After all they were copying not only a best selling book but the most successful movie ever made in Sweden. How could it help but be better. Unfortunately I was wrong on all counts.This should have been a piece of cake. They weren't working from a book but already had a very good movie to work from. It seems like the worst they could do was just dub it in English and reap millions. Instead they started with a Terminator beginning like a James Bond movie, completely out of place and inexplicable. Then they get a director of dark, scary movies to create a dark mood with DARK visuals to make everything hard to see and understand. Sure don't need that with a complex plot. The music seemed out of place also. You don't need all this scary stuff when the story is absolutely frightening without it and when the contrast of bright clarity and horrible actions is much more shocking.A word about the characters. Daniel Craig looks a lot like the Swedish actor Michael Nyqvist except without the bad skin. Both were very good actors. The Girl Lizbeth (Noomi Rapace) was excellent. Going in everyone knew this was an Academy Award part besides being a three film role. What actress wouldn't want this role? And Mara Rooney also did a great job EXCEPT - now maybe I'm just getting old but they had her whisper stuff and mumble things and I absolutely couldn't hear or understand them. In a movie that has such incredible suspense you don't want to be asking the person next to you in the theater what the hell she said.Don't get me wrong. I like this movie. It was frightening. It was shocking. It was consequently REALLY memorable. But what an opportunity lost. I can't imagine how it could be easier to make a movie when all you have to do is copy a great one, make it in English, and improve on the weak points. Unfortunately it's sort of like they remade Pride and Prejudice with John Woo directing, and used rap music. The movie is a ""B"" that will get treated as an ""A"" because of the subject matter of abuse of women and how graphic the scenes of sexual abuse are. Rooney will receive awards, etc. But oh, what it could have been.If you like this movie, which you will, get the Swedish version. You'll like it better.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

why??,"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is one of the best crime solving stories I've ever seen/read.finding out about 2 years ago that they'd be making an American remake with the intent of opening the story to a bigger audience was a bit insulting. there's no need, if people want the film, let it be David Fincher/ Steven Zaillian. there's nothing like fresh out of the oven. remakes are stale and somewhat bitter by attempts of bettering the original. to gain the approval of the audience over a remake is a quite difficult thing, not only would actors are demanded to follow descriptions, layouts and backgrounds from a book (Millennium's case) but also meet or even surpass the that portrayal presented once before. as it is in love, it is in films; that first time forever will be special.nobody likes their work overlooked and redone by others. watch the original as the say. you won't regret it, and if it's a matter of language then The Millennium trilogy was dubbed to English not long after it was first released, also subbed, knowing what's going on without having to miss the beauty of the original actors' voices and feeling put to the characters by it. no one should be robbed of that.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Rather less than the sum of its parts,"I've not read the book or seen the original Swedish film, but I'm more than willing to go to the cinema to see a new David Fincher film... more often than not, his films have impeccable cinematography and sound design. These are both present in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, but, as a film, I found it underwhelming and verging on genre silliness. The film it reminded me of the most is the Charles Bronson vigilante drama Death Wish... here, our lead actress (who plays an unknowable, almost Bronson-like cypher) is violated and seeks revenge. The violation is nasty, fetishised and dwelled upon by the filmmakers for too long, and the revenge is comic book and simplistic.This 'cause then consequence' narrative structure continues throughout the film - it's very formulaic. The plot about dark family secrets is rather stodgy, although it would like to be edgy, like the Danish dogme melodrama Festen. There is excruciatingly awful dialogue in the sex scene between Daniel Craig and The Girl, the climactic action scene underwhelms on a genre level, and the long, drawn out coda had people in the cinema heading for the exit early.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The girl with the dragon tattoo,"I have read the book and was really looking forward to seeing the film. I was pondering between choosing the American or Swedish version.

It was horrible and it made me switch on the subtitles. I know that it is impossible to have in the film everything that was in the book; however, some very important things were left out. As a result, Mikael & Lisbeth look rather shallow. They are there, they do things but the viewers do not really know why. Actually, just like all the other characters. Also, some things were completely different from the book (not just slightly) and it did not help the film. I do not understand how this film got such good reviews.

Definite improvement upon the Swedish version,"Let me just start by saying that I have both read the book and seen all three of the Swedish films, so going into the theater I knew what to expect. And I have only positive things to say. Sure, a lot of the scenes in this version resemble those in the Swedish one, but that was to be expected, wasn't it? I mean, both films are adapted from the same novel!About the film itself: As you might expect from an American remake with David Fincher behind the wheel the film is a lot more action packed and goes through events a little faster than the Swedish version. The cast is superb and very well picked, and the atmosphere throughout is very dense and isolated. As the story slowly unravels it becomes more and more gruesome and mysterious, and it grabs you and doesn't let go for the next hour and a half. Then what seems like the showdown arrives, but the real answer to the great mystery is even more surprising than you think, and it's something you couldn't have possibly thought of, but which, when you think about it later (as I'm doing now) is pretty much the only logical one. As the final scenes, which make the connection with the second book, play out you can't help but feel sad that it had to end so soon.SUMMARY FOR THOSE WHO DON'T FEEL LIKE READING THE ABOVE: This film is definitely better than the Swedish version, and its mystery has a way of gripping you and not letting you go until the end.

"Perfect adaptation, and casting.","Obviously I thought that this film was absolutely flawless, albeit gruesome. I think it was a wonderful adaptation of the novel, and the acting was absolutely astounding. It has a wonderful score, wonderful editing, wonderful cinematography, etc.I think the one thing that gets to me is the amount of people assuming this film is a remake of the Swedish version; or that the Swedish version is considered the ""original."" I find that humorous because The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (2011) wasn't based off of the Swedish version, it was based off of the novel. They're two separate film trilogies, based off of the same novel.I feel as though Rooney played Lisbeth a tad better than Noomi, simply because Rooney has the ability to be completely and truly androgynous, while also being incredibly attractive while also terrifying you with her looks at the same time. Not to mention her ability to absolutely remove all emotion at just the right moments is phenomenal.Don't get me wrong, I love Noomi; she's absolutely gorgeous and wonderful at acting. However Noomi, while also a good Lisbeth, isn't androgynous enough for me. She never makes you second glance and ask, ""What gender am I looking at?"" I also don't find her face empty enough like I do with Rooney's. Which is also why I enjoyed the bleaching of Rooney's eyebrows, to help rid her of showing any emotion.I could spend hours talking about why I enjoyed this film so much, and explaining my love of Rooney and her role as the new Lisbeth, but to sum it up: the film was impeccable as was the acting.

His investigative skills are famous and attract the attention of Henrik Vanger (a typically superb Christopher Plummer). Henrik, another magnate, hires Mikael, ostensibly to write his memoirs, but actually to help uncover why a niece of his mysteriously disappeared 40 years ago.Henrik doesn't prevaricate. He tells Mikael to be weary of his family, who he unhesitatingly calls 'the worst people you will ever meet' (two are 'ex'-Nazis), and to suspect everyone, including Henrik. Mikael works from one of Vanger's outhouses, keenly trying to keep warm in the arctic weather (the film is painted in shades which reflect the bone-numbing cold).Most of my memory of this film is how tedious the storytelling is. Mikael alternates between his Apple Mac and his wall of notes, interviewing people in between. I confess I quickly lost track of all the names, dates and events, which is never as good compared with knowing all the details and guessing the culprit. Mikael realises he will not solve the case alone, so requests help. Enter Lisbeth Salander.The only interesting part of this film, the only reason to part with your money, isn't to find out whodunit, but to see Rooney Mara's unfettered and courageous take on Salander, the film's eponymous heroine. Salander is the ultimate Private Eye-come hacker. Give her two minutes and she'll bring up a list of all your indiscretions, even the ones you forgot about.As a character, Salander is a fascinating creation. She's a multi-layered enigma. Institutionalised from a young age, she passes through life as a ghost. Her sexuality is ambiguous. Is she a lesbian? Bisexual? Judging by the blasé, almost mechanical way she stands in front of her desired match – male or female – and simply undresses, I'd say she is asexual.A big distraction was Daniel Craig. I don't see him as a cerebral actor. I would have given the part to Viggo Mortensen, who was considered. But Craig is Bond, so that means he is second only to God. The film tries to both American and Swedish. Sweden may be the setting, Swedish may be the characters' ethnicity, but English, bizarrely, is the language. Plummer, although spot on, was replaced by Max Von Sydow, a true Swede, who would have brought authenticity to the artifice.I felt the ending was an anti-climax. Will I be spoiling anything by saying it's the one you suspect from the beginning? I also couldn't understand why Vagner waited 40 years before revisiting the case. Those sorts of details spoilt it for me. Except for a vicious rape scene and a macabre torture sequence, you couldn't tell this was by Fincher.What is it about this story that attracts so many people? It can't be plain old retribution: that would be plain and old. Maybe we're attracted by the notion of superwomen in cinema. Is this a new fetish? I hope so.www.moseleyb13.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A Masterstroke!,"From the novel of the same name by Stieg Larsson, Maverick Filmmaker David Fincher's 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' is A Masterstroke! A nail-biting, brutal, edge-of-the-seat thriller, that ranks amongst the best films from 2011!'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' Synopsis: Journalist Mikael Blomkvist is aided in his search for a woman who has been missing for forty years by Lisbeth Salander, a young computer hacker.'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' is a must see because Writer Steven Zaillian fabulously adapts the Novel, that in all aspects, is gripping, brutal, nail-biting & edge-of-the-seat. The Suspense gets intense & fierce with each passing sequence, while the characters only get darker. Zaillian's Adapted Screenplay is truly remarkable!Fincher's Direction is Razor-Sharp & Haunting. The Maverick Filmmaker has handled this Thriller masterfully! Cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth is flawless. Editing by Kirk Baxter & Angus Wall, which won an Oscar, is indeed crisp. Art Design is good.Performance-Wise: Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander, delivers a knock-out performance. Her Oscar-Nomnination doesn't come up as a surprise at all. This is a star-making performance! Daniel Craig as Mikael Blomkvist, is first-rate. The Great Christopher Plummer is terrific, while Stellan Skarsgård has never been this good. Robin Wright is impressive. Joely Richardson is top-notch. Yorick van Wageningen is loathsome!On the whole, 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' is a must see film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Rooney Mara IS exactly what I imagined Salander to be!!!!!!!!!!,"I just saw the movie yesterday. I was hoping not to be disappointed after seeing all of the posters & teasers & trailers...and I wasn't. Having read all three books, my first glimpse of Rooney Mara as Salander led me to think ""OH! She looks just like I imagined her too look!!!"" It's like she jumped off of the pages of the book! Thank you David Fincher and everyone else involved for painting this movie so brilliantly and for casting it the way you did. INCREDIBLE! Daniel Craig, too is a perfect Blomquist (far more attractive than I imagined him to be! Thanks! Bonus+++). Whatever creative karma you all (people making the sequel) have going on PLEASE keep it up for the next 2 movies. I think it's a great film and a great story and a great tribute to a writer that died way too soon. BRAVO!!!!!!!!!!",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
it was OK!,"I've never read the books or seen the original Swedish film but all I can say is that it had a decent story and the acting was superb. David Fincher did a great job molding this piece together. It wasn't terrible but it could of obviously been more.I sat through a 2 hour and 45 minute movie that was fairly slow in pace and very inactive. It had interesting and captivating moments but it really wasn't something to kill over. Honestly, if you have never read the book OR seen the original Swedish film than I can fully say as an audience member you can pass on this one.Wasn't terrible, it wasn't excellent, just a standard film that isn't something I would go crazy over.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Fincher Teaches An Old Dog New Tricks!,"'Dragon Tattoo' hit the cinemas on Boxing Day, only two years after the original Swedish version arrived, a massive hit in its own right. Both films are based on the bestselling book, written by Stieg Larsson as part of his 'Millennium' trilogy. You'd have to question why Hollywood would remake a movie so soon after the original, but that tells you a lot about the state of Hollywood right now.Pros and cons aside, though, this is a fun movie. That needs to be established. I was engaged, I didn't get bored, I was even leaning forward at points because I was so immersed in it. When you have a team of people that includes David Fincher, Daniel Craig and Christopher Plummer, that's the least you should expect, and it succeeds on that level.The story quickly - disgraced journalist Mikael Blomqvist (Craig) is asked by the retired and stupidly wealthy Henrik Vanger (Plummer) to find out which member of the Vanger family killed his granddaughter fifty years ago. Blomqvist agrees, and quickly starts his investigation. He ends up finding out about Lisbeth Salander (Mara), a girl with incredible hacking skills and a very distinctive tattoo. She helps him with the investigation, and the rest of the film is them trying to solve the case.But, obviously, no good film is ever as simple as that. There are lots of smaller sub-plots and character histories, adding more layers to the story, and pushing it beyond the typical whodunnit. While it's good those layers are there – and I'm sure the books delve much deeper – the restricted running time means that those subplots aren't fully explored. I won't go into spoiler territory, but we have to believe characters are able to achieve things without consequence, so the movie doesn't slow down. The exact same problems are there in the original Swedish version; I really wish Fincher had tried to remove those problems, but he didn't. Another issue with the Swedish version was the controversy over the graphic sexual violence in the movie. There's graphic sexual violence in this version too, and it's not for the squeamish. But, frankly, it's justified. Those scenes do as much a good job of building character and tone as any in the movie.But enough of where Fincher falters, let's talk about where he excels. A quick IMDb search showed me that I've seen almost every Fincher film, and they're all great. The guy knows how to make a film. What he does best of all is bring out outstanding performances from actors who don't really seem suited to their role. Brad Pitt in Fight Club; Jesse Eisenberg in The Social Network; and now, Rooney Mara. Mara is stunningly good as Lisbeth, just fantastic. Vulnerable, unhinged, sexy, detached, steely, feminine – she goes through a whole gambit of emotions without really ever saying much. It's all in the eyes. Her partner in crime is Daniel Craig; granted, this is a role we've seen Craig do many times, but that's not a shot. He does it well. But what really griped me was the fact that everybody spoke in Swedish accents, except Craig. Why? It made no sense. You forget about it eventually, but it's still puzzling.I'm not gonna go on and on about every single cast member, because it'd be a waste of your time. But if you know the people on this list: Christopher Plummer, Stellan Skarsgard, Steven Berkoff, Robin Wrightthen you know you're in for some great performances.The other bits of the film – the music, the cinematography, the editing – are typically brilliant. The music's all techno-y, the cinematography is all Swedish-y, and the editing is all frenetic-y. And you've got a cover of Led Zep right at the beginning, which is always welcome, despite the fact that the opening montage is more Bond-like than anything else. It seems out of place from the rest of the film, but good visually nonetheless.There are things to fault, it's not perfect film. But it's still a brilliant one. For Mara's performance alone, it's worth watching. Inevitably, people will compare her to the original Girl, Noomi Rapace, but Mara makes the character her own. Everyone else is just as great, and you're left with a movie that leaves you wanting more. And, conveniently, we won't be far away from more.Watch it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Sound / music / dialog,"The sound, and music are without doubt the worst my wife and I have had to endure in any motion picture foreign or domestic. The so called suspense sounds are ridiculously ineffective. The noise, so called music, distract from the dialog, making it impossible to hear in some instances. Evidently actors no longer find it necessary to speak distinctly. Surely they weren't taught that in their training. It has become the norm to mumble, and slur words,particularly when speaking softly. Scenes with ""whispering"" are totally incoherent. A few years ago we attended the holiday concert of a 200 +/- man chorus in Boston. One of the pieces was totally pianissimo. You could understand every word. No excuse for lack of diction, nor in the noise blotting out speech. The foreign / Swedish version was infinitely better.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

It's set in stunning landscapes, in real snow, in real towns, just very real. That all adds up to being in the movie if you watch it, you're there, in it.

Easily the best movie of 2011,"Admittedly, 2011 did not have much to offer in terms of outstanding movies. There were some decent titles, but the majority of the movies, actors, actresses, etc nominated for Golden Globes and rumored Oscars simply felt undeserving. In order to be appreciated for such awards, I always used to think something extraordinary needed to be produced, and unfortunately this year, I felt like that was not so.The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is the only extraordinary film I have watched of 2011. It delivers superb acting, brilliant storytelling and script, and unprecedented directing.David Fincher has long been a favourite director of mine, with classical titles such as Se7en, Fight Club and Zodiac to name a few. After a rather over hyped Benjamin Button, I felt like Fincher really redeemed himself here. Dragon Tattoo manages to capture the suspense and thrill of Zodiac, but through a different perspective in a different world.Probably the best part about this movie is that you can have zero knowledge about the book and the previous Swedish version and still walk out amazed.For whatever unknown reason, I believe Dragon Tattoo is just short of a masterpiece, the only reason being why I didn't give it a 10. However, as stated before, it is easily the best of 2011. If it was up to me, it would get the directing, script and actress Oscars without question. I'm disappointed to see this movie merely as an underdog at the Oscars as opposed to an ""expected"" nomination/prediction. It deserves much more credit given the mediocre standard of movies produced in 2011.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Not Fincher's Best But Good,"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a prime example of why you should pay attention to the messages a given movie is trying to send before heading willy-nilly into a theater. This is a film that is based upon a deeply disturbing series of books that spawned a deeply disturbing series of foreign films and which features the tagline, ""The feel bad movie of Christmas."" If you read between the lines here, I believe you should be able to make an educated guess as to the kind of movie this really is.Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) is a journalist whose career appears to be over. After publishing a scathing expose on a powerful Swedish businessman, Blomkvist is sued for libel and is found guilty, a finding that will cost him his life savings, his reputation, and a short prison sentence. At a loss for what to do next, Blomkvist takes a meeting with Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), an aging but prominent corporate leader. Blomkvist is presented with a proposition that turns out to be more tempting that he could have ever imagined. Vanger promises to give Blomkvist the evidence he needs to clear his name and in exchange, Blomkvist will attempt to solve a mystery that has vexed the old man for 40 years: the murder of Harriet, Vanger's niece and favorite family member who went missing at the age of 16. With the help of Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a socially stunted but immensely valuable private investigator, Blomkvist soon finds himself embroiled in a vast and complex cover up that threatens to consume every aspect of his life.To describe Dragon Tattoo as ""rough"" would require that you change the definition of the word. More like ""exceptionally brutal"" and ""not at all something you'd want to see with your parents."" I feel sorry for anyone who made the mistake of taking a post-Santa trip to the theater with the family without knowing for sure what they were getting themselves into. I was 14 when Titanic debuted and I had a number of friends who had their Christmas Day movie with the family ruined by the unexpected awkwardness of Kate Winslet's breast popping up on the screen. Dragon Tattoo is approximately one hundred thousand times worse. Even the opening credits are a bit demented (though visually stunning) and that's just a sample of the brutality that follows. Dragon Tattoo is about as raw as it gets for a mainstream movie and despite the fact that I had read the book and knew what to expect, it still made me squirm more than once.If you can get past the cringe factor, Dragon Tattoo is a quality but ultimately flawed film. Director David Fincher put together a fantastic cast filled with actors who fit their roles perfectly. Led by Craig's usual calm and understated demeanor, the performances within this film are strong to quite strong, though none compare to the work of Rooney. I don't think this is an Oscar-caliber portrayal but it is certainly one that will move her to the top of the list for a number of high profile roles over the next few years. And as always with a Fincher film, the technical aspects of Dragon Tattoo are exquisite. From the score to the shot selection, this is barely a step down from The Social Network, which was nearly perfect from a behind-the-camera standpoint. Fincher uses every element like it belongs to his directorial Swiss army knife, heightening the intensity here, providing subtle detail there. Fincher is the master of creating imperceptible tension within each audience member, building it until you suddenly realize that you're sitting on the edge of your seat and your heart is pounding. In this regard, Dragon Tattoo provides the perfect subject matter.But where the film struggles is in the way Fincher tries to tell a convoluted, web-like story. In the book, author Stieg Larsson weaves together several stories that don't initially seem to connect in the beginning and he does so in excruciating detail. It is a slowburn of a read but one that I found compelling. In order to present every concept within the book, however, Fincher makes the mistake of jamming almost every ounce of story from the source material into the film. The first third of the movie, then, moves at a rapid pace that doesn't fit the story, the characters, or even the actors. There's a hint of Aaron Sorkin in the dialogue but it doesn't contain the expert craftsmanship that usually accompanies a Sorkin script and it doesn't fit Craig's brand of subdued acting. Moreover, Fincher tries to pack an excessive amount of information into the first act and none of it connects very well. As a result, we get a number of short, choppy scenes that don't flow together and make it quite difficult to settle in. I'm a big fan of Fincher overall but I think Dragon Tattoo displays his limitations, or at least his weaknesses. Far from Fincher's master work, it is nonetheless an intriguing and worthwhile film that you may not want to take in on a full stomach.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
True to the books - Hollywood did good!,Hollywood did not mess this up. David Fincher did a spectacular job putting this together and he did a great job putting his own spin on it. I think the best strategy was what they did - they did a completely different angle than the Swedish set of movies. You really can't compare the two - they're both spectacular.Loved the opening sequence - very James Bond-y. All of the actors were great and Daniel Craig was awesome as Mikael Blomkvist. Rooney Mara also did a great job. The cinematography was great. It stayed true to the books while taking on a bit more of an action-y feel.

OK, in term of special effects, camera angles, you know setup, this movie is way better but then if you compare the thriller in this one with the original version I think that this version is way under. I'm not saying, like I've seen here, that you should definitely see this one because of Daniel Craig's acting, or just give you the classic stereotype ""oldies but goldies"" regarding the Swedish version. I'm just saying that if a movie is born in some culture, Nordic in this case, you should at least let go of the American felling when you rate it. For me even the Swedish accent makes it more mysterious and more thrilling than this one.

"Fincher has done it again, a brilliant new addition to his impressive resume","Review The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.The English adaptation of the runaway success story of 'The girl with the Dragon Tattoo' was always going to be a large undertaking due to the 'best-selling' Stieg Larsson's Novel and the highly rated Swedish adaptation by Män som hatar kvinnor.Even for a director such as David Fincher, who can boast a career built on many hugely popular titles such as 'Se7en', 'Fight club' and 'The Social Network', an undertaking of this magnitude and an inability to produce a film that was deemed worthy of its attachment to the novel would be disastrous. Although not doubting his ability, the undertaking of this project could be seen as a bold but exciting move. Fincher's adaptation is every bit exhilarating and in depth as the base material.The intense intricacies of the novel are displayed well throughout the film. These are an essential foundation for the trilogy but are obviously detrimental the motion and speed of the picture. For a 2:40 hour film, these areas can slow the pace to a point where people around me were nearly nodding off. Combined with an inability of many English speakers to learn and follow the characters Swedish names, the opening of film can be challenging for those seeking easy gratification and not familiar with the characters.The numerous side-by-side narratives that permeate into the main plot are very well constructed, shot and acted. It is through these vessels that Daniel Craig and in particular, Rooney Mata shine.Mara's transformation into the 'cyberpunk-esque' hacker is flawless. I often completely forgot her as an actress, a true testament to her performance. I found that she breathed a greater sense of humanity into her version of the character which was a great loyalty to the novel.Craig's performance is obviously integral to the film but it is all the better alongside the mesmerising Stellan Skarsgård as Martin. His performance is truly great and sits well alongside the strong acting casts' offerings.The film displays the action and points of conflict in a heart racing trance, you cannot help but be consumed by the intensity and realism that's pouring out the screen. Brutal, unflinching but not prosaic in the slightest, these scenes bind the audience to the characters trails and battles in a very close and personal way. We feel their pain, think their thoughts and sympathise with their positions.Throughout the viewing experience you are held by that feeling that the film you are watching is going to be something that not only will you watch again, but champion it to your friends and colleagues. I have already had discussions about this film with groups of people that some may regard as outside of the typical demographic. Like the novel and Swedish version this has the ability and power to mesmerise large portions of the population. An excellent adaptation expertly constructed and flawlessly acted.8/10 The_Frase",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Simply extraordinary!,"A Swedish cinematic trilogy which was a great hit in its country and we can understand why. Americans feel obliged to remake these foreign gems with often unfortunate results, but not this time. My state of mind after seeing this film in one word: WOW!An extraordinary film on so many levels. A mysterious modern whodunit in which the story is peeled away one layer at a time, without revealing the rest to come. An almost futurist thriller, where the new information technologies are center stage. An imagery of reality in the raw. Complex and vulnerable characters. Fast paced action which keeps you riveted to the screen for more than 2 hours. And what can be said of this resilient character, Lisabeth, the girl with the dragon tattoo who dominates all her scenes in a role which surely will mark cinematic history for years to come, no less. Even Daniel Craig earns my kudos for his role. There are so many ways to appreciate this film that I'll probably go back for a second viewing while it is still in the theatres. It's really that good. Six weeks after its release and the theatre is sold out, a rare feat nowadays. Truly a standout film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

An astonishing film,"What an awesome film! I can't think of anything else to start with when I tell a person about this film. What an awesome film! The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a thriller film directed by Academy Award nominee David Fincher and written by Academy Award winner Steven Zaillian.The thing I loved most about this film was the pacing. In this 2 and a half hour long film, you never get bored. Not one single time! I really admire when a film makes me stay with it 100%. I remember There Will Be Blood doing that to me in a similar way. Rooney Mara was stunning in her performance as Lisbeth Salander. Daniel Craig didn't give his best performance ever, but he was OK, and the chemistry he had with Mara was very good. In terms of acting, Christopher Plummer was amazing as Henrik Vanger and I hope he will never retire from acting, although he is already 82 years old. The original score of the film was great and I am surprised it did not get nominated for an Academy Award. David Fincher also did a nice job. Not as good as in other films like The Curious Case of Benjamin Button or The Social Network, but still, satisfactory work and in concordance with the rest of the film.The movie was so good, that I was expecting something spectacular from the ending. Well, I didn't get that. Don't get me wrong, I thought it was a smart and logical ending, I simply didn't like it.

Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a terrific mystery-thriller and one of this year's best dramas,"When it was announced that David Fincher would be re-adapting The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo there was a split in the fan base of both the book and the 2009 Swedish film directed by Niels Arden Oplev.

From a great book to an average movie,"I confess: the movie was a disappointment. The book and the deepness of the characters is far superior. A book of course has far more potential when it comes to describe a large family over generations and their internal battles. The genealogy is important to understand the various relationships and I admit having had to go back to earlier passages to reposition the players. The book is magnificently constructed with far more content to the ""investigation"" and the development of Lisbeth's character. It also seems that the book's intermediate end (what did really happen to Harriet) did not please the director, so he took a shortcut: open for discussion. In conclusion, people who did not read the book are likely to give the movie a higher rating. To them I strongly recommend to get the book and ... enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Solid puzzle mystery thriller,I am very satisfied at the end of this hard thriller. I like this kind of mystery movies where tricky puzzles must be solved. The landscapes of Sweden were beautiful and created a good atmosphere. The performance of the detective work of Daniel Craig and his assistant Rooney Mara were very respectable. Then another great plus for this film was the experience of director David Fincher who delivered the other legendary thriller Seven. What I didn't like therefore was the long running time of two hours and a half. As I mentioned in other earlier reviews the playtime must not exceed 2 hours. I think that a few scenes could have been cut here. But don't understand me wrong. The Girl With The Golden Tattoo took me anyway on a real hell trip with lot of turns and twists.

A Tattoo to admire.,"Based on a best seller, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is another piece or art that makes its treacherous journey from the paper it was born on, to the silver screen. Donning the mantle of trying to do it justice are Daniel Craig, of Bond fame, and Rooney Mara who starred in The Social Network and Nightmare on Elm Street. Her striking transformation leaves an indelible mark in the viewers mind and is only surpassed by her performance of a badass, tech genius with social deficiencies. Craig on the other hand is anything but Bond like and successfully does his bit not to be pigeonholed as an Action-Man. Instead, he parades his acting chops and demands to be recognised for his ability.David Fincher, the director who brought us memorable films such as Se7en, Fight Club and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is clearly capable at the helm of Stieg Larsson's masterpiece. Fincher gently steers the audience down two parallel winding paths where the travellers are spiralling in their own lives only to meet at a crucial junction. Before you know it, you're hooked and are unable to turn away. Under the surface of the mystery, David gives you haunting glimpses in to the disturbing and nauseating primal nature of man, which is brutal in its reality.In a genre riddled with predictability and well-travelled twists and turns, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is a refreshing breath of fresh air. Both Craig and especially, Mara only enhance Fincher's vision further with notable performances.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A pretty standard movie for most part but that's not necessarily a bad thing of course.,"For me personally, this movie was not that much special to watch but then again this might be due to it that I have seen too many English detective-series already, so that might explain why I wasn't that impressed by the story and why everything came across as quite standard. That's not a bad thing of course but it did prevent me from seeing this movie as anything spectacular, surprising or that very involving.In that regard, this perhaps is also a bit of a disappointing movie, also when considering who was at the helm of it. David Fincher movies are always something great to me but there is basically nothing about this movie that screams David Fincher out at you. It might just as well had been directed by a totally different director.The movie in essence is a whodunit. It just takes awhile for the movie to finally get there and make clear to you what it is all about. Seriously, when looking back at it I don't really know what the point of its entire first hour was. The introduction of all of the characters- and the setting up of its plot lines, could had all been done much simpler and quicker. Actually because of its first hour, I had a really hard time getting into this movie. But yes, eventually I did, when the story started to become more focused.But then came the last 20 minutes, or so, along. The movie was beginning to suffer from the same problems at that point again. It went on for too long and the movie really gave you the impression it should had all ended way sooner because the story felt pretty much rounded up already. With its 158 minutes, it's a really long movie to watch and there was no reason really for the movie to be as long as it was. It's probably only so long because they were afraid to leave out some elements from the books because it might anger some of the fans of it, which could had harmed the movie financially. But really, purely from a movie perspective, lots of the stuff and even some of the characters should had been left out. It would had made the movie and its story more focused and less fragmentary and confusing to follow at times.Really, this was still my biggest problem with the movie; the story felt very fragmentary to me. Basically it had a story of characters going- and talking to each other but most of the time I was actually wondering 'now, who is this?', 'where is he going?', 'why is he going there?', 'why is this character or story-element relevant to anything?'. I know this is an usual thing for a thriller-mystery to do but the movie does it in a bit of a messy way, which doesn't always make things look connected to each other.I'm probably sounding like I hated this movie but that is of course not the case. It's just so I had issues with it, which all prevented me from seeing this as a great or successful movie within its genre. It's a good movie but not really one I am ever likely to see again. At least not any time soon.And that's really all this movie comes down to; it's certainly a good enough movie and really not an horrible one in any way or form but really all together, not all that special.There are still multiple things that make this movie better than just average, the acting being one of them. I especially liked Daniel Craig in his role and the movie also has a really solid supporting cast with actors such as Christopher Plummer, Stellan Skarsgård, Yorick van Wageningen, Steven Berkoff and Robin Wright involved.I still foremost liked watching the movie, just never fell in love with it, in any way.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Much better than expected,"Having read both the books and watched the Swedish version of the film, I did not have high hopes for the remade American version. I was concerned about how a big-budget, Hollywood style movie might take away from the rawness of the story. Turns out I had nothing to worry about.This American version is actually much more true to the book than is the Swedish version. The only major change from the book was that Blomkvist did not have sex with every single female character that showed up in the story (thankfully, the Swedish version left this out, too, because it was just ridiculous). Besides this, it incorporated many aspects of the book that were left out in the Swedish film. The result is a very long film, which may start to drag on for people who have never read the books, but which is certainly enough to satisfy fans. Despite being a somewhat flashier, higher-budget version, this version of the movie does a good job of incorporating a lot of the rawness of the story. There are plenty of horrifying, cringe-worthy scenes that are not censored anymore than the Swedish version (in fact, it almost seems as though Fincher was trying to be even more shocking).The acting and casting was superb. Daniel Craig is a perfect choice for Blomkvist; despite his previous macho hero roles, he does a great job in bringing out the vulnerability of his character. He is a relatively mild-mannered man who finds himself caught up in some dangerous situations. Although I don't feel like anyone can ever do any better than Noomi Rapace as Salander in the original movies, Rooney Mara certainly came very close with a much different style. Mara brings out a little more of the emotionality of Salander but still well mixed with the blank mask of a traumatized girl. The chemistry between Blomkvist and Salander is very well done in this movie - there is a certain warmth between Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara that was lacking in the Swedish version. Other notable performances include Christopher Plummer as Henrik Vanger (who borders on amusing when he talks about his family squabbles), Stellan Skarsgard as Martin Vanger, and Steven Berkoff as Frode.I did have a few minor issues with the movie. The accents were pretty poorly done. It felt as though the directors and the actors couldn't decide whether they wanted the characters to have accents or not. Some characters had part-time accents and others seemed to have no accent at all (Daniel Craig, in particular). I wouldn't really mind if none of the actors had Swedish accents since this is an English-language film but there is definitely a need to be consistent. Unlike other reviewers, I was not at all a fan of the soundtrack. Most of it hardly sounded like music to me - sort of just techno sounds half the time. The worst was the opening credits with really bizarre Gothic art and a song that just seemed very at odds with the rest of the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Long...but entertaining,"A film of this magnitude always runs the risk of over-hype. Fortunately, TGWTDT lives somewhat up to it. I can't say that all its 158 running time is worth it, but enough of it is. Of course films based on books always come to the screen with pre-conceived notions. In this case there's not only a book written by Stieg Larssonbut a previous film to follow. This is never an easy challenge but director David Fincher seems to have welcomed it with open arms.The film's basic plot centers on the forty year old disappearance of the niece of rich and eccentric industrialist Henrik Vanger played handsomely by Christopher Plummer. After hiring recently humiliated journalist and amateur sleuth Mikael Blomkvist, played by Daniel Craig, we learn little by little about Plummer's family treefilled of course with weird and rotten apples. Intercutting nicely with the detective portion of the film is the parallel story line of the title characterLisbeth Salander played by an unrecognizable Rooney Mara. After finding out Salander was initially hired to do a background check on Blomkvist before being hired by Vanger, we follow her life which includes computer hacking, beating up street punks and reporting to her new court appointed guardian. This of course leads to the films most graphic and talked about scenes which include forced sexually favors and rape. While this is going on Blomkvist soon discovers that the missing niece may in fact be the victim of a serial killer and requests a research assistant. Naturally who better then the girl who researched him and the meeting of the two main characters finally comes full circle. Once together Blomkvist and Salander work well as a modern day and unconventional Nick and Nora Charles to both find the serial killer and discover the mystery of the missing niece. Along the way they also find some sexually affection and even have time to give another industrialist his comeuppance. Craig's performance shows intelligence coupled with a vulnerability that makes us forget that he's James Bond. Equally good is Rooney's Salander who obviously makes us forget she's the beautiful girl who unwittingly launched Facebook in Fincher's The Social Network. Speaking of Fincher, his style here is evident throughout with realistic violence balanced with beautifully shot flashbacks. The ending of the film is satisfying and naturally leaves itself open for a sequelI just hope it will be a little shorter.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Inspector Morse revisited,"The girl with the dragon tattoo is perhaps Finchers weakest effort with a cut and paste rendition of the Swedish original that couldn't hold my interest either. Although beautifully shot in the lavish Finsheresque style, the story of a talented young investigator who teams up with a journalist to unravel a 40 year old mystery belongs in an episode of Inspector Morse rather than in a 3 hour long attempt to warp time.From the completely out of place opening sequence up, I was thoroughly annoyed that the film couldn't grab and hold my attention for even more than 3 consecutive scenes. It in stead annoyed the hell out of me with the incompatible soundtrack compiled from the left-overs of Trent Reznor's previous soundtrack for The Social Network. Perhaps even more annoying are the two completely unconnected stories that take forever to intertwine and didn't spark an iota of interest in the outcome of the story or the fate of the protagonists.There is Zero character development, a totally forgettable scenario combined with a a far too linear, thin and familiar plot culminating in an inescapable conclusion which all the same didn't make any sense unless the killer wanted to be caught.Watching this, I had trouble resisting the urge to do the laundry.3/10",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Somewhat closer to the book and much more compelling,"Well most of you probably read the book (or the trilogy even). It was and still is a bestseller, something that starts and ends a conversation over a short coffee break. An easy read, thrilling story and a Swedish touch, who could resist? David Fincher certainly couldn't. Thank you David Fincher for taking the matter seriously, as always.The story follows the book better than the Swedish original, the characters are portrayed in a more thorough way, systematically so to say. This is a good thing of course and if you put Hollywood money aside, the biggest difference between the Swedish interpretation and the Fincher vision. The visuals are superb, the winter of Swedish north was revealed in such a way that even I felt the coldness (in my cozy little apartment) and the chill in my not so old bones.My rating is a strong eight, I could be nine but I am still struggling with the casting choice for the Lisbeth Salander. I still believe the Noomi Rapace would be better, but you know what, if the Oscar goes to Rooney Mara, you will know that I am wrong (wouldn't be the first time). Anyway, a strong recommendation follows: watch this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The best movie of 2011,"While the Swedish original was a very good film, with very good performances (especially from Noomi Rapace and Peter Haber), this 2nd adaption comes out superior. I love how Rooney Mara's take on Salander expands on yet more levels, taking Mara up to the heights of acting legends. I doubt I've ever seen a more complete and convincing performance from an American actress. Daniel Craig is also perfect in the role of Blomkvist, while the Reznor & Ross soundtrack is absolutely incredible. I went twice to the cinema to see this film, and I'm not the least disappointed having seen it twice in a short period of time. This is a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Fenominal,"Where do I start, the movie was amazing. Daniel Craig was great and Rooney Mara put on one of the best performances I've seen in a while. The plot was great, David Fincher is my favorite directors. There were many subplots that made the characters what they were and who they were. It definitely was a detective movie that showed how they found information. I think that how they had the family made a comical touch. I believe this is a best motion picture and it should win. There was good suspense and action and I love the part where the serial killer is revealed. I'm not going to spoil the movie for anyone because this is worth going to the movies and then buying it on DVD. I want to see David Fincher make the other 2 movies because this was fenominal.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Best film of 2011.,"David Fincher is brilliant. I thought he had maxed his potential at Social Network, but he came & did it again. Having not seen the Swedish film or read the novel, this was a completely new story for me. & I was blown away! Daniel Craig gives a solid performance as Mikael Blomkvist, a disgraced journalist tasked with solving a 40 year old murder. The supporting cast is excellent as well, in particular Christopher Plummer & Stellan Skarsgard. But the real star is Rooney Mara, as Lisbeth Salander, an emotionally damaged and unstable woman bordering on insanity. In every scene, she owns the character. She's fierce, wildly sexy, and unbelievably authentic. She better get an Oscar nomination.David Fincher is known for his dark, edgy style & it shows in this film. the cinematography is fine, but its the score that really shines. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross definitely produced a phenomenal score that goes well with the film. Oh, and don't let me forget the opening credits! Amazing, one of the best.This film is R-rated for a reason though. There is quite a bit of nudity and a particularly disturbing rape scene. Just be forewarned. Overall, my favorite film of the year, just beating out Drive.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Just showing solidarity with all others who realised what an abortion this version is,"I have a strange relationship with the story of 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo'.On a long international flight back home, it was the only book I could find in English in the bookshop that didn't have a blerb that made me vomit. Over-hyped though it was, I thought it would fit the bill, and it did. It helped keep me sane over the cramped hours.Then I saw this version of the film, and it didn't make any real impression.Eventually, I discovered it was a remake and went and sought out the Swedish original.So - read the book and saw both film versions. You might conclude that I must really like the story, and hold the author in great esteem?I regret this is not the case, oh dear me no.Without wishing to insult Mr. Larsson's ghost, I'm afraid I think his book is boring and over-rated - it certainly didn't motivate me to read the other two. And I've read much better mysteries that could have been made into films.I think the Swedish version is a rather good film that removes some of the book's tedium, but it's still nothing that I'd label as an ""enduring classic"" or some such hyperbole.I think this version, now I have the context of the real film, the original, is a steaming abortion and frankly rather embarrassing:The opening credits are idiotic, grating, and inappropriate: telegraphing that wheels had fallen off.Rooney Mara's performance is shockingly, appallingly bad. Perhaps it was the script and a completely talentless director? I don't know.Daniel Craig mailed-in his performance.Everyone but Craig has absurd Swedish accents but speak in English.The music is god-awful, sorry Trent but it is, it's totally wrong for the film.It's almost a shot-for-shot remake of the original, but in a purely colour-by-numbers, box-ticking way.Everything is More, Bigger, Longer, like a Spielberg effort. The sets are bigger, the vehicles are bigger, the houses are bigger, the rooms are bigger, and everything is stretched out as much as it can be, but without any added finesse.A cardboard and lacklustre, going-through-the-motions, rubbish film.And even more boring than the book.------",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A Star is Born,"In 2005, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, the first book in Swedish journalist and writer Stieg Larsson's ""Millennium Series"", was published; unfortunately, Larsson died without ever having the opportunity to see his books published, let alone how popular they would go on to become. The novel went on to become a worldwide best seller, as did the two sequels: The Girl Who Played with Fire and The Girl who Kicked the Hornet's Nest. As the books grew in fame, and Swedish film adaptations of the series were successful, so did the likelihood of Hollywood film version.In order to meet the complexities within the novel, a director proved capable of handling such complexities was needed; there was no better choice than David Fincher. Fincher, whom in prior years had been nominated for Academy Awards in Directing for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and The Social Network, was tailor made based on previous films, such as Se7en, The Game and Zodiac. The decision to film the movie on location in Sweden was an intelligent choice, as it allowed the natural elements and locations to set the backdrop. The biggest decision Fincher made, and one that would make or break the movie, was casting choices. Daniel Craig, best known for playing the latest incarnation of James Bond, does a fantastic job as journalist/investigator Mikael Blomkvist. Craig's best attribute is his ability to play up to the strengths of his character, and with Blomkvist it's his charisma and submissiveness. Although Blomkvist is one of the central characters of the film; without question, the star is Lisbeth Salander, played by Rooney Mara. Mara gives an Academy Award worthy performance as the socially awkward Salander. Mara commands the screen in everything she does. Mara provides the character with such depth, that you sympathize with Lisbeth and understand her need to not attach herself to anyone. If an Oscar Nomination doesn't come her way, it would be disappointing. The rest of the supporting cast is also impressive; Christopher Plummer continues to get better with age, as Henrik Vanger, Stellan Skarsgård is wonderful as Martin Vanger, and Yorick van Wageningen gives one of the creepiest performances of all-time as Nils Bjurman.No film is without flaws, and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has a few. The one issue I had with the film was the opening credits; it played like a music video and was entirely unnecessary and there's one sex scene near the end of the film that wasn't needed. Aside from that, I thought the film stayed very true to a book with approx. 480 pages. With a book of that size, certain parts must be left out of the movie; I truly believe that what wasn't included, wouldn't have improved the film. Without a doubt, this film is one that merits a lot of consideration come Awards season. Rooney Mara's star has begun to blaze ever so brightly and deservedly so. The transformation into her character alone was impressive, but to look the part and be the part are two entirely different things and she was able to achieve both. David Fincher accomplished what he set out to do, to make a brutal, mysterious and brooding film and I enjoyed the end result.Grade: A+visit our site at www.twodudereview.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Captivating mystery,"When it comes to mystery/ crime genres i'm more of a visual kind of type. I've never read the books, so i was completely unaware and untroubled by the fact that i'd just experiment with watching another movie without any expectations. And i think this is one kind of way to enjoy a film.For starters, the cast was fantastic! I was only remembering Daniel Craig's playing in this movie, never looked for any information before. And there's, Christopher Plummer and Stellan Skarsgard, Robin Wright and of course Rooney Mara (she was great). Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) is a journalist who's been assigned to do a research on a missing woman. Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) is a hacker who assists him. It's a lovely mix of mind and science. It keeps you wondering about the crimes and the connections and the psychology. Like, everyone's a suspect.The scenery was beautiful, gloomy, overcast, creating an additional suspense especially with the foggy locations. Cold colors. You'll have to get cold to get comfortable (that means your emotions, too). Director David Fincher did a great work, and i see that he's bringing up '20,000 Leagues Under The Sea: Captain Nemo' in 2013. Also, 'The Girl Who Played With Fire' is the second book adaptation of the trilogy and it will officially start shooting back in Sweden at the end of the year.Overall, it's a very interesting mystery film with nice twists.

Welcome surprise,"I really liked this movie, had no idea what the story line was or anything about the movie other than my wife read the books. I think the job Rooney Mara did was amazing. I want them to develop more movies based on Lisbeth - was a great performance. Daniel Craig was as good as he has been in the other movies I have seen him in. Story line had me dying to find out what was going to happen next. The rape scenes were about as haunting a scene as I have seen in some time. Lisbeth was determined, tech savvy, strong, resourceful, but very human and didn't fall into the ""superhero/unstoppable special agent category.

Mesmerizing,"Mikael Blomkvist has been convicted of libel against Wennerström(whose pretty much only perceived as a villain in this, one of the few arguable failures of this) and the fee he has to pay costs him his life savings. So when he is offered a large pay, as well as the inside scoop on his nemesis, he agrees to, in return, try to solve the 40-year-old disappearance case of the daughter of Henrik Vanger, the retiring and dying leader of the concern named after him. The suspects? His entire family. The wealth and power is alluring, after all. He is aided by the Goth hacker, Lisbeth. I didn't think I was going to say this, especially because I loved Rapace's performance, but Rooney Mara *is* Salander. The mannerisms, the anti-social behaviour, the voice, everything, spot-on. This is the far more interesting(and emotionally involving, both her to us and her with others) take on her(like other things in this, it's deeper), such as the clear Asperger's Syndrome aspects to her(not present in the other one). These are not hammered home, they are there and if you know what they are, you'll see them. They come naturally to this, as many other things in this. This is not a remake or Americanization of the Swedish film, it is a fresh adaptation of the novel, and without having read it, even I knew things that that one missed, and they are in this, and this is all the better for it. This is far superior to that one; while not in every single respect, the things where they match or this is lesser are insignificant in amount and/or scope. One negative that is perhaps noteworthy is that not only was this shot where it's set, no, they went the extra mile with Swedish pronounciation and poorly attempted accents, and this is awkward and requires getting used to. This doesn't convey the isolation, however, in its place is the freezing cold. The theme of men of authority who hate women and make them suffer is explored well. This doesn't remove anything that was extreme in the original, rather, it makes them even stronger. It is a brutal, disturbing, sexually perverted tragedy with a moderate amount of swearing. The ending and opening(reminiscent of that of Fight Club) are infinitely greater, and leave an imprint on you. I don't know how, since this isn't much longer, though this definitely fits in a lot more, and has a richness of detail that the '09 one lacks(and while I know that those were meant to be a mini-series, I'd say this is the better approach, separating the installments and not making them all at once). This has a good mystery, if I'm unsure if the hints towards the solution are excessive or not. I recommend this to anyone who might like it(be sure to know what you're in for, this pulls no punches). 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

A movie you can sink your teeth into - satisfying!,"Finally got a movie I could sink my teeth into, ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."" One of the things I liked best was its length, which, like a book you find yourself drawn into, you feel delighted and look forward to spending some time with these characters and this story. The plot developed the leads separately, brought them together and then gave them time to interact and time to give a satisfying conclusion so we find out what finally became of the missing girl. So I was happy to sit and participate and see what would happen, like a satisfying mystery or spy story. And Rooney Mara is very hot as the female lead, showing her sexuality in a very natural and appealing way, at least for me. Not at all in a smutty way, even though the temptation must have been there. She plays a self-imposed outcast, not a misanthrope.And as for Daniel Craig, I disagree with Roger Ebert, that he comes across with the same confidence he showed as James Bond. In fact, like 'The Descendants,' where George Clooney allows the older daughter character to, at times, overshadow his character so that he really does come across as the clueless, feckless father, Craig also doesn't seem to demand the audience's attention be focused on him. Nor is he a particularly strong character – he never fights anyone; it is Dragon Girl who gets the chance to do damage to the villains. In fact, Craig's best qualities are the humanity and sense of character he brings to a role, without any melodramatics, exaggeration or heroics. He just allows us to sympathize with his character, as he did in 'Defiance.' So, overall, I was drawn to these characters and plot line – a satisfying film experience – 3 ½ stars of 4, an 8 stars out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Fincher's remake about the same as the Swedish original.,"'THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)David Fincher's English-language adaptation of the popular Swedish novel 'Men Who Hate Women' by Stieg Larsson, the first in the 'Millennium' series trilogy (which were first adapted in to films in Sweden in 2009). Fincher's remake stars Rooney Mara in the lead role of Lisbeth Salander, A.K.A. 'the girl with the dragon tattoo' (which is a performance she's received an Academy Award nomination for), and Daniel Craig as Mikael Blomkvist. The screenplay was written by Steven Zaillian.The story in this first chapter revolves around journalist Mikael Blomkvist taking on a missing person's case in which he's asked to travel to a remote island and solve the disappearance of his employer's niece, who went missing over 40 years earlier. Blomkvist just had his reputation tarnished by a corrupt businessman and is looking to clear his name, which his new employer, Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), promises he can help him do (if he works on his niece's case). Mikael believes the disappearance of Vanger's niece has to do with a series of serial killings and enlists the help of a computer hacker (Lisbeth Salander, who was hired by Vanger to research him) to help him catch the maniac.I'd rate the movie about equal with it's Swedish counterpart. Once again I loved elements of the movie and really wanted to love the entire film but found it just a little too long and dragged out. Fincher's directing, editing and entire visual style is once again superb, Mara is outstanding and the score (by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross) is mesmerizing but the pacing is just a little too slow (at least at times). Probably due to the filmmakers once again staying just a little too faithful to their source material. Lisbeth Salander is an all time classic 5 star action heroine role though and I look forward to seeing more of her in future American adaptations.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pe8CEO75Pj0",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

This movie proves that Hollywood can do art-house.  Again. The Swedish must be gutted.,"For the second time in as many years Hollywood has come out to face up to the competition from outstanding Swedish cinema with remakes that, at the time of announcement, seemed indecently hasty.Cashing in, one might conject? Maybe so, as the movies in question, ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" and ""Let me in"" could both b e accused of copying the Swedish originals quite closely.So, Boxing Day in the UK saw the much anticipated Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, stateside version, hit our screens and boy does the US cinema industry once again show that it can hold its own against European art house with some ease.The original (Swedish) movie, which was adapted from a mega hit novel by Steigg Larson, was outstanding.This reviewer gave it an IMDb score of 9.0. So how does this compare? In a word. Admirably.Indeed the US version actually communicates the story slightly more clearly than the Swedish adaptation (and that's not a comment about subtitles).The fact is, David Fincher is on fire and he has once again crafted a thriller that sits proudly alongside Se7en.The film opens with a thundering, and truly awesome, cover of Led Zepellin's Immigrant Song by Trent Reznor and Atticus Rose (the Social Network) - there's a nice touch early in the movie when Lisbeth's go to man for forgeries appears wearing a NIN T shirt - and the opening credits, again like se7en are worthy of an Oscar in their own right. Brilliantly mixing oil and flame (a theme that bookends the movie) they set the scene to perfection.Black. Black as you can get.You'll probably know the plot if you're reading this so I won't go into it; it's a complex and interwoven tale of historical murder and modern day defamation mixing religion, Nazism and extreme sexual torture, but it's all handled with a restraint that makes it all the more shocking in a directorial masterclass by Fincher. With the exception of the brutally bad Benjamin Button, Fincher is building a body of work (including The Social Network, Fight Club, Zodiac The Panic Room and Se7en) that makes him the current king of the thriller and one of the best and most reliable directors in Hollywood.Daniel Craig is very good in this but Rooney Mara blows him away with a performance every bit as good as Roomi Rapace's in the Swedish version.This is a languid, but often shocking, storytelling experience. It's a great movie. Sure, it's only really a pseudo cop film but it's got everything that anyone loves about great film making could hope to see in a luxuriant 156 minutes.Magic. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Fincher Blows the Swedish Version out of the Water!,"Fincher's version of the international bestseller blows the original Swedish film out of the water, and rarely, rarely does an American remake of a foreign film surpass or even equate to the original. For example, I saw French horror film ""Diabolique"" and foreign Sci-Fi ""Solaris""; then watched the American remakes and all throughout I was thinking, ""Shame on you Hollywood!"" To my splendid surprise that wasn't the case with Dragon Tattoo. Every single aspect of the English version is phenomenally superior to its predecessor: directing, acting, editing, cinematography, production, script, music score, plot construction, suspense, terror, and especially Rooney Mara's Lizbeth Salander.The Swedish version is 152 minutes; with the English version you get twice the amount of story and character development in only 158 minutes. I cannot for the life of me understand why every Swedish film maker thinks they're the first one to discover the art of slowly paced story-telling, or why they think they know how to do it right when a great deal of the time they don't.Fincher has painted a dark, evil, haunting picture that makes his previous thrillers such as ""Panic Room"", Se7en"" and ""Zodiac"" look like tame, PG-13, M.

The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"Discredited journalist ""Michael Blomkvist"" (Daniel Craig) is invited to undertake some family investigation work by retired industrialist ""Henrik Vanger"" (Christopher Plummer). It turns out that a young girl disappeared from the family mansion some forty years earlier and he wants to know what happened. Meantime, the enigmatic young ""Lisbeth"" (Rooney Mara) is trying to break herself free from the influences/perversions of her legal guardian ""Bjurman"" (Yorick van Wageningen). She, having been the source of the information and investigation that lead to the earlier troubles of ""Blomkvist"" is particularly adept at survival! As the mystery deepens, the former engages the detection services of the latter and their search for the truth becomes distinctly perilous. The book is great, and this adaptation does it justice for the most part. Perhaps the screenplay could have been a little tighter, the first half hour takes it's time to get going, but once we have been introduced to this top notch cast representing the somewhat dysfunctional family then the pace of the film really hots up. For once, Craig delivers well and there are strong performances from Steven Berkoff, Stellan Skarsgård and Plummer ensuring that things build nicely to a denouement that, though perhaps not too surprising, is patiently and tensely delivered by David Fincher. Every bit as good as the first film version of this tale, a testament to what an A-list cast can do with a strong story and creative direction. Well worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
makes me puke,"well well i thought that after destroying Let the right one in (Låt den Rätte Komma in) by making such a s**t remake Hollywood won't do it similar things anymore but they had to like always they need to destroy thingsGirl with dragon tattoo (Män Som Hatar Kvinnor) is great movie, great acting and directing everything, so David Fincher thought he can earn so made re-make of the same movie with same story just with Hollywood stars who honestly sucked in this, special girl who acted Lisbeth she ain't up knees to Noomi Rapace who did same role in original,anyway this is one more tragedy that come from united states of Hollywood from directors who don't have anymore ideas so they are stealing from others and when u doing a re-make you need to do it better if u can't get the f*** of it,,,,,,,,if u really wanna do favor to people don't do other two from trilogy",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"A true masterpiece.....was starting to lose faith in the American movie industry...until i saw this tonight leaving the theaters at 1am...completely blown away...so many say the ""swedish"" version is better....i've never seen that version...and don't intend too...i plan to read the novels...it is a very dark film and showed me everything i wanted to see. quite beautiful in my eyes really.. the actors were superb...camera angles...everything...i found no flaw in this movie...sure..i've only taken a film class in college...but i consider myself to be of higher movie critique in the average joe community...Go see it...",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A rare case of foreign language,"I decided to watch this movie twice because I couldn't quite decide weather this or the Swedish original were better. After a second viewing I must say that this is probably one of the only cases in which an American remake of a foreign language film rivals or is in fact better than the original.The cinematography is excellent, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross prove that their score from ""The Social Network"" wasn't just a fluke, Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara's performances are superb.I would recommend this movie to pretty much everyone, although to content may be disturbing to some viewers.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Got great moments, still like the previous version best","I watched the Swedish version, and then this one. These are quite similar and weak plot- spots are also there. Lets look at the movie, independently of the original. The directing and whole technical stuff is very good. It has thriller moments done well, making watcher excited. However, the plot seems unfocused, as it jumps between several topics. Also the ""Ocean's 11 elements"" at the end were something I did not like. The investigation end was somehow not strong enough, I guess they needed to stick to the original plot (book), so it stayed that way. There is something annoying to (at least for me): the Swedish accent that was forced by many characters (that are actually not Swedish actors). Craig played really well, as most of the actors did. Now back to the original. The main lack is actually the Girl's role. Noomy Rapace has that something. She's tough, wild and fully fits the Girl's role and comparing to her, Rooney Mara is quite pale. So, finally, I'm not sure the re-adaptation was needed, at least in that short time: having the plot very similar and the Girl's role degraded, only Craig and the ""technical"" stuff showed up as a benefit.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"""It is better to look at what I'm about to show you on an empty stomach""","The above quote is used only once in the movie, but it ironically sets the tone for the entire film.""Dragon Tattoo"" has a strong chance of being the most memorable adaptation of a book since Harry Potter. David Fincher's follow up to ""The Social Network"" is nothing short of a terrifically terrible roller coaster ride of unpredictability.As far as acting goes, Daniel Craig and Chris Plummer gave their usual stellar performances. The shining star, however, was obviously Rooney Mara, who gave a downright chilling performance. Aside from her Oscar-worthy acting, the fact that she was willing to change her body so drastically for this role says a lot about her character. She isn't here to be another role model or sex symbol, but she is here to be what many Hollywood stars are drawn away from being: a damn good actress. We have without a doubt not seen the last of Mara.This movie was able to take a simple mystery case and turn it into the most interesting movie of the season. Be warned, however, for as the quote suggests, it is also one of the most brutally graphic movies of the year. The scenes are so captivating, however, that you may not even remember that you are surrounded by other people anyway. However, it is still not by any means a family/date movie.

A disgrace - go for the original,"I was quite enthusiastic about seeing this title, thinking that Hollywood did make a successful remake this time around. God I was so terribly wrong. The movie starts with an intro in an extremely trying-to-look-artsy way, that is so much more than simply boring, than it shouts ""uninspired"". Yet I sat back, thinking that I haven't seen the real thing yet, thus I must not be all that critical from the beginning. What a mistake. As usual for an American remake, this one is not an exception. The acting by both Craig and Mara was extremely uninspired, just like the intro of the movie, that I mentioned above. I must admit that they did make the effort to actually go and shoot the ""thing"", meaning the movie in Sweden (yet I failed to understand why did they show the Swedish news in English though). Apart from that Craig looks kind of lost in his part, while Mara's way of recreating Lisbeth was so, so plain. Overall the movie was a huge disappointment for me, yet so boring, I did even fall asleep, right before the hours-mark, when I actually stopped even bothering myself watching it further more. If you did like the novel, or have somehow heard nice things about the original( or even about the remake) just try not torturing yourself with it, but instead go for the real thing. Rapace does pull off an Award winning performance in the original, while the whole movie itself is not to be even compared to the remake whatsoever.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Loved both the movie and the book,"When I first heard about the book I didn't think I would like it. It just sounded crazy. But when I finally sat down with it I couldn't stop. It was absolutely gripping. It has been a few years since I have read it so I can't be real specific. I liked it so much that I couldn't put it down and bought the rest of the trilogy. They were all great but the second two wandered a bit after the gripping tension of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. Thank goodness I read them in proper order.The first time I watched The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo it was on Netflix and in Swedish. Luckily the subtitles were good.

One of the absolute best films of the YEAR!,"This movie was beyond fantastic, truly a well made film which let's face it, may be hard to come by often these days. Daniel Craig who plays the main role does so in such a thrilling manner as well as Rooney Mara who had me convinced she'd lost her marbles. From a cinematic point of view, it was directed by one of the best thriller directors out there David Fincher who redefined the gory twist completely with the 1995 film Se7en. Fincher made the audience compelled to watch to see what happens next. Although a negative point would be that the film starts slowly and holds that pace for a while, but if you stick with it you will no doubt be more than satisfied ( because it does ""speed up""). I can honestly say that this film is a must-see but if blood & gore, violence , substance use and/or graphic sex scenes/nudity tend to bother you, i would undoubtedly advise against this movie. If you feel you can take it, you are in for the ride of a lifetime. I recommend this movie 110% !",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Fincher Film for sure.,"If you like Zodiac, this is better than Zodiac. This film has way fewer characters and much better pacing.

Daniel Craig is amazing, but it's really odd not seeing him kick everyone's ass, I forgot he isn't James Bond in this movie.Good performances all around and a fairly easy to follow story with a nice twist.Strong cinematography as well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Sadness, Drama, Fear, Thriller, Love, Action. Just brilliant.","I saw this film in cinema as to the fact I had been meaning to see a David Fincher film in cinema for a while.

The film tells the story of a man in Northern Sweden who has been spending the last 40 years tracking down his niece's killer; he hires a Journalist who uses a Computer Hacker to aid him in tracking them down. But their discoveries soon lead them to realise they are being hunted down as well.It is a thrilling ride and easily one of the greatest films of the 21st Century. An incredible piece of art this film is. Rooney Mara changed her character from this young sweet girl into this deadly emo women that looking at her will scare you to death. When I saw the beginning of the film and noticed in the title credits Christopher Plummer was in it, I of course knew it would be a good film, he played his character amazingly.

A first-rate Fincher thriller,"Back in the early 2010s it was hard to avoid the massive success of the Millenium series by Swedish author Stieg Larsson, which starred the motorbike-riding, dragon tattoo-wearing sleuthstress Lisbeth Salander. The first book received the Hollywood treatment in 2011 with David Fincher's 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' to critical acclaim but little fanfare at the box office.As with any Fincher film, there are plenty of dark undertones combined with impressive storytelling in 'Tattoo,' with every moment of the 158-minute runtime being used to advance the plot. In terms of acting, Rooney Mara delivered an impressive performance, bringing to life the quirky nature and badass-ness of Salander - and it's not surprising that she earned an Academy Award nomination for the role. Daniel Craig was no slouch, either, as his portrayal of the disgraced journalist Mikael Blomkvist ranks among his best (although a step down from his 'Bond' outings).But it's not just the twisty plot or the A-list acting that makes 'Tattoo' what it is. The original score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross gives the film an unsettled feeling throughout, while the Academy Award-winning cinematography adds a sense of grandeur to the mystery.While it may not have performed to the degree that many were hoping, this film stands alone as a high-quality whodunit that will hold the attention of any fan of the thriller genre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Fast-cut editing does not equal genius,"David Fincher. 30-second spots strung together for 2 1/2 hours. As much as I love a beautiful scene, a quick, clever edit and Trent Reznor's edgy sounds all separate from each other, these elements together are not the way to tell this story – a complex one at that. Because today's youth, and by extension their parents, are so enamored with anything that is ""quick,"" it has to be revered as a work of genius?Fast-cut MTV-style editing, like fast talking, does not make something good. Just because you, audience, could not follow entire sections of the plot doesn't make you dumb. It makes the director dumb.I give it a ""3"" for raw techniques, music, albeit totally misplaced and gratuitous. And a good performance by Rooney Mara.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Complex and in depth mystery that's spiced with raw and erotic feel good sex appeal.,"I for one am not a big reader of novels, and I have never read ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"", yet I must say that David Fincher's in depth and long drawn out film adaptation had me in interest with suspense and complex thought. As one knows any Fincher film often shows the brutal and raw nature of life and with many scenes in this picture he pulled back no punches. As one watches this complex drama a mystery of dirty secrets will unfold and the film is guided by it's grit and raw erotic sex scenes which keep the viewer even more intrigued.The story involves soviet journalist Mikael Blomkvist(Daniel Craig)who's a man that's clearly a little burned out with his work only it once again gets interesting when he's hired by a rich international family man Henrik Vanger(the superb Christopher Plummer)to investigate the disappearance of one of his dear loved ones a young girl in the family. Only soon thru it all Mikael's investigation will lead to more and more gruesome discovered disappearances and brutal murders. On the side in an interesting subplot is the arrival of an exotic and strange computer hacker named Lisbeth Salander(in a raw and gritty performance from Rooney Mara)and she is Mikael's assistance to breaking the secrets and lies of the dark past underworld of many cases. Along the way the passion of hot erotic and kinky sex encounters occur between the two which spices the film up some. And as always with a Fincher film he shows how brutal life can be it's often raw and wicked as evidenced by the blunt and provocative rape scene.Overall good film that will hold your interest even though it's drawn out and complex it's one interesting mystery of secrets, and an interesting journey. The film shows that life is raw and often mysterious with secrets and lies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Solid well made dark thriller.,"Unless you have been living on the outlying tip of a remote island, under a pile of rocks, you may well of heard of the late Stieg Larsson and his Millennium book trilogy.The books have been phenomenally successful, kick started a Swedish literary thriller bonanza and inspired three critically acclaimed and box office successful Swedish film versions, albeit subtitled for English speaking markets.Whether there was a need for a remake, is largely irrelevant, Hollywood found many compelling arguments, one suspects with dollar signs on each and every one.However, the first film arrives with an A list director, David Fincher and Daniel Craig reprising the part of Michael Blomkvist, a campaigning left leaning magazine journalist. Lisbeth Salander previously played by Noomi Rapace, has been replaced by the relatively unknown Rooney Mara, in a part ruthlessly pursued by many aspiring and established actresses.Following a highly stylised and beautiful credit sequence, albeit seemingly disconnected to the story, we are plunged into the ""feel bad"" event movie of the year.Licking his wounds after being on the wrong end of a libel suit, Blomkist and his ""Millennium"" magazine co-owner and on/off lover, Erika Berger (Robin Wright), decide their next move.Meanwhile, Henrik Vanger (Chrstopher Plummer) a retired CEO of one of the largest Swedish companies, continues to receive pressed flowers from the killer of his murdered Niece. Blomkist is called upon to investigate the murder, under the pretence of writing a history of the Vanger family. Initially reluctant, he realises this represents the perfect escape from the media spotlight, following his much publicised trial.Relocated to the remote snowy wastes and the spectacularly dysfunctional extended Vanger family, he has his work is cut out for him. To help in this quest, he is eventually joined by arguably one of the most unusual and well written anti-heroines to grace the silver or indeed, any screen.A pale, thin, motorcycling hacker with spiky hair, no social skills whatsoever, unashamedly bisexual, amoral, tattooed, much-studded and with a photographic memory. Lisbeth is the best investigator on the books of the firm hired to background check Blomkist, it is good to see Goran Vijnic on the screen again, as Lisbeth's long suffering boss.To provide too much further detail of the plot would provide spoilers to those two or three people left in the world, who have not read the books or seen the previous films.It is fair to say that the film stays true to the story, feel and tone of the books. The violence is strong but not graphic, rape scenes are featured but again are filmed in a non-sensational way and the events portrayed are very relevant to the story.Craig makes for an excellent Blomkist, managing to effectively distance himself from James Bond in every way, even the way he walks is very different. Mara is as effective as Rapace was in the role, indifferent, caring, streetwise, childlike, a walking bundle of contradictions. If you follow the story further, her character's background is extensively explored. Budget of course allows for better set dressing and production values but the overall this is ultimately no better or worse than the original. Although the addition of English as the spoken language will please those with subtitle-phobia, which was the point of the exercise.The story is set and filmed in Sweden, to do otherwise would have been foolhardy indeed. The snow adding to the sense of dread and foreboding in every frame. Christopher Plummer is his usual commanding self, it is a shame he does not get more screen-time due to the story.There are many supporting players, all played by well respected character actors, including Skellan Skarsgard, Geraldine James, Joely Richardson and Stephen Berkoff.Fincher has dialed back his usual directorial flourishes, this is a complicated story to compress and the script by Steve Zaillian has managed the job of presenting the initial rush of dry family information, perhaps even better than the book.The film perhaps did not do as well as the studio had hoped but parts 2 and 3 have now been green-lit, so the full trilogy will work it's way to the screen over time. Which is a positive news, as the film does not deserve the fate of being the solo entry in the story.SummaryA great story with fine performances makes for a solid well made dark thriller.A long film but the time will slip past as you are drawn into the dark underbelly of a country few knew much about, before the recent explosion in Swedish thriller literature.http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Nice try but no.,"In a nutshell, this remake lacks the depth and feel of the original. This is not an reinterpretation: the plot, and visuals alternate between being a virtual copy of the original but also cuts out key elements that made the original much more engaging. Daniel Craig was good although it made no sense that he had an English accent. Rooney Mara's performance seems silted compared to that of Noomi Rapace which feels like directorial influence. This version lacks the atmosphere of the original. An unnecessary and disappointing remake.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The girl with the dragon tattoo,"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is a murder mystery/thriller directed by David Fincher in which investigative journalist for Millennium Newspaper in Stockholm, Sweden Mikael Blomkvist(played by Daniel Craig). After being found guilty of libel is asked by Henrik Vanger(Christopher Plummer) former CEO of his family's company to stay on his family's island to the north to find out which one of his family members killed his niece over 40 years ago or if she is still alive under all while under the guise of him writing a memoir about him, promising in return a larger salary and evidence to prove he his libel to be false. He eventually garners help from the title character Lisbeth Slanader(played by Rooney Mara) who is a troubled young adult and ward of the state, but is an skilled investigator in her own right. I can't tell you how close it follows the book, but overall it is an entertaining and well put together film.The acting in this movie is great, but Rooney Mara steal's the show with her performance which is one of the best this year, by getting completely into her role, from getting drunk the night beforehand to look hung over even though she herself is not a heavy drinker and getting stark naked multiple time throughout the movie, once being in one of the rape scenes, and the character herself gives the expression of someone who is dark and anti-social while keeping it fresh, even her accent sounds Swedish. Even though Craig's performance is not as good as Mara's, he still does a fine job acting a serious dramatic part, instead of just a pure action star which I have only seen him as until this point, but his English accent can get distracting at times. The film itself also has a large ensemble of Swedish actors which makes the setting all the more believable.The on set locations for this movie added to that since of isolation and uneasiness Mikael felt throughout the movie when it starts out in the middle of winter and with Sweden at the time experiencing the worst winter in 20 years it definitely added to the feeling of the movie and with seasons changing throughout the movie it gave the viewer the feeling of months are actually passing by instead of keeping a similar looking environment throughout the year.Despite all the pros about this film there are still faults to be had with it, the major one is introducing characters who have little to with the plot and forgetting them the rest of the movie. An example of this is when Lisbeth goes to fellow friend house to get a device to trace people's emails, you could say that is to show how she got the item, but there is another item later on in the movie showing her putting up surveillance cameras without showing how she got them, maybe that character got more time in the book, but in the movie he is pretty much useless as a character. Another fault of the movie is that I really never felt like I knew the family, sure there were small note cards, but not enough information to see them as characters and with them barely mentioning their names it was hard to tell who was who and who they hated, when they mentioned them and near the climax when they are piecing together the final parts of the mystery, like Mikael said, ""I think I am getting confused on who is who."" As I said before I enjoyed this movie and pros far outweigh the cons. 4/5 stars.

Hmm...It reduced from a great thriller to a simple murder mystery,"Hmm...It reduced from a great thriller to a simple murder mysteryWhen I watched it first time a few months earlier, I was in awe of Rooney Mara and the way the whole subject was handled and directed and finally made into a movie. When I watched it today, all my enthusiasm came down to the understanding of a simple murder mystery of a girl who has for some reason been assumed to be killed by someone.Amidst this murder case, there is a libel case which our hero Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) has lost to Wennerstorm and this comes back much later just to redeem the lost glory of our hero. Now who does all this is Lisbeth Salander played wonderfully by Roonery Mara, she is a surprise to all those who have not known much about her and her ability.All other departments fared well and a special mention to David Fincher and what a movie he has made up. This is a mystery that holds up for long and he does a pretty good job till he held the mystery. Once, we know the murderer is known, he gives away the fun. Also, I am not sure if Wennerstorn was a main plot or a subplot coz he takes up the last 15 mins of film which I don't think was so important and just a glimpse of what happened to him was enough. Having said that, those 15 minutes were important too in establishing the GIRL as one superb woman who can go to any extent to does what she believes in. But she does all of those very unrealistically, can't we just simply bluff so many European officials, I really doubt.David Fincher has lost it only at the end apart from which most of it was good, yes cinematography was exceptional and so was the background music, editing should have been so lot better, the same duo who worked for 'The Social Network worked for this and they won an Academy award even for this but I did not like this film's editing though.If there is any reason for watching this movie then it's Rooney Mara. It's a 3/5 for a good movie that's good as a murder mystery and OK OK for everything else. It just could have been so better had a few moments been cut out.Note : I did not see the Swedish version, nor did I read the book, I perceived the film as it is, if anyone is offended then please take it easy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The Swedish version was better,"This film, like the Swedish version two years ago, is based on the best-selling novel by Stieg Larsson. In modern-day Stockholm, a recently disgraced journalist is hired by an elderly member of a rich, dysfunctional family to solve the mysterious disappearance of his great-niece in 1966 in a countryside estate.This film is reasonably well-made but not as good as the original Swedish version. My bias might mean nothing to those who didn't see the original. This remake seems redundant and unnecessary though many people seem to like it.There was an attempt to be authentic by having the actors speak English with their best attempts at Swedish accents. Also, some signs and newspaper headings were shown in Swedish. This attempt at authenticity failed occasionally when English was used in handwritten notes and email texts.Even while knowing the outcome of the story, some important scenes in the remake seemed confusing and ambiguous while others were less exciting.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Very Disappointing,"My wife and I had read all three books, and saw all three Swedish movies. We had been so excited about the new ""Hollywood"" movie, and went to the Tuesday night first showing.The opening credits, while very unusual and visual, were totally unrelated to the movie. If anything, it was disruptive, and like watching the credits of a James Bond movie.Having watched the sub-titled Swedish movies, we were looking forward to the English version. However, so much of the dialog in this movie is spoken so softly or mumbled, covered with intrusive background music (or noise!), such that we were wishing for sub-titles in this one! Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara have perfected talking without moving one's lips.The story was not nearly as well explained as in the Swedish movies. If one has not read the book, I daresay he will feel very clueless as to what happened to Mikael at the beginning, and will struggle to understand what is happening.Our theater was packed for the opening show. I found it interesting that when it was over, the crowd simply got up and left, without the kind of excited conversations one hears when people have loved the movie. I sense that most of our audience shared our feelings....what was the point of making this movie, when such a wonderful movie had already been done.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Maybe if I knew Swedish then I won't say it is better than the original one,"I have watched the original one but have not read the book. I've also lived in Sweden. I was apprehensive that it will be an English-i-fied, the way that you expect when Hollywood tells stories of various European epics, stories etc. Well this was not, Daniel did not have to have an affected Scandinavian accent -- except for Rooney and Robin Wright maybe. Nevertheless, the story was really told well.This rendition is more dramatic because Rooney evokes more vulnerability than the original actress Noomi and maybe because it is in English it is easy to internalize the plot. I think the opening montage is ridiculous. Totally out of context for the movie, very James Bond 007 like and stupid but of course does not take away from the performance of everyone in the film. personally - I'd rather have the original actor Michael Nyqvist than Daniel.It is worth seeing even though it is not as stoic as a you'd expect in a typical Swedish movie but has the direct yet complex undertone of the Scandinavian psyche.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) - Wow! Now I Kind of Want to Read the Book!,"Director David Fincher reunites with his highly-accomplished team from his previous movie, ""The Social Network"", and has made a thriller film adaptation of Stieg Larsson's Swedish novel series. The dazzling opening credits of this film are just impressive, as if the movie itself. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" stars Daniel Craig as a newspaper journalist, asked to recover a 40-year-old mystery about the disappearance and possible murder of a young girl. He then teams up with Rooney Mara, in a deserved Oscar-nominated performance as the title role, as an expert researcher and computer hacker that has been involved in the investigation, after recently making a background check on Daniel Craig's character. Don't be fooled by the trailer, when thinking it's a live action thriller. But it's actually a realistic, murder investigation story. I've been a huge fan of director David Fincher, when seeing two of his movies, ""Fight Club"" and ""The Social Network"". Now, he scored a triple home-run with ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"". He carefully executes this movie perfectly, with plenty of time and precision, that not even a long conclusion can ruin. The cast is just plain superb. Daniel Craig is always perfect playing the investigative journalist, Christopher Plummer plays the uncle of the missing suspect, Robin Wright as Craig's work partner and long-time lover, and Stellan Skarsgard as the brother of the missing suspect. But the scene-stealing performance belongs to Rooney Mara. She steals every scene in the movie, and she owns the entire movie. She perfectly captures the innocence of her character, and shows the right vision of darkness into her role. What a ""shining star"" performance by such a young actress! I was immediately blown away by the haunting music score of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, that perfectly tells the story. The visionary film editing by Angus Wall & Kirk Baxter, is delivered with such speed and timing, that it deserved this year's Academy Award win for Best Film Editing. The writing is true and believable, the directing is visionary, and the acting is just plain superb. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is perfect for audiences who either read the books, or haven't read the books. This is a slow, strong, violent, dark, thrilling, and exhilarating roller coaster ride. This is also one of the best movies of 2011.

A Supposedly Unusual Mystery that Doesn't Succeed,"30 April 2012. What makes perhaps for a great fictional crime thriller mystery novel doesn't make for a greatest film adaptation except maybe for a politically correct feel good statement in the guise of artistic creativity. Who for instance would even cooperate with such a young punkish female with no social grace none whatsoever? Though amazing and somewhat suspicious transformation occurs by the end of the movie. The movie would have been much more compelling if the repulsive reactive behavior of those associating with this girl would have been on display and her ability or her surrogate more likely were able to negotiate their way around this antisocial demeanor and obtain the necessary investigative facts upon which this amazing mental talent of a girl could then synthesize such facts into an incredible criminal deductive conclusion, much like Sherlock Holmes and his cocaine habit - What a genuinely valuable script and performance that would have been. What one does get is the almost predictable techno-blackmail scenario in the movie as perhaps the only fascinating and somewhat credible social interactive scene in the movie with the girl in another political statement. What one has however is this anti-heroine nominated for best actress Oscar who supposedly gets our critical sympathy and yet authentically and realistically speaking her amazing investigative ability notwithstanding, it's implausible she would really be able to accomplish what is supposed to occur prior to the occurrences in the movie and thereafter until suddenly the audience is confronted with another persona late in the movie. Somehow freakish and unusual characters capture our imagination and fascination, nevertheless, it is the more subtle and performance of everyday characters that are the most difficult because they require a superior performance to capture and maintain an audiences interest.The movie, in part, depends on an Addams Family assortment of characters from a Hitler era which somehow become a lost after-image as the movie develops as well as on the supposedly convoluted investigation of an assortment of clues, especially photographic compilation in fine chronological detail, sort of an extended Criminal Minds television series episode much better exploited in Manhunter (1986). This fusion of Point of No Return (1993) and Antitrust (2001), Hanna (2011), and Silence of the Lambs (1991) becomes some less of a mystery with its predictable murderer, loses a lot of its suspense and in this case less isn't more. The character development is weak even though it would in this movie have improved the substance of this movie especially as the movie wasn't supported by major special effects or action sequences. Lisbeth's character also wasn't consistent in her early setup particularly to the extent that her actions at the end of the movie weren't as expected as that might have been. Developed as more of a mystery thriller, even The Spy Game (2001) or The Three Days of Condor (1975) had more of the compelling and attention absorbing suspense than Dragon Tattoo whose post-climatic scenes whose outcomes seemed without surprise or doubt, and even in those instances where the doubt isn't really expected, there is still the ""rapt"" possibility that can grab one's attention as in The Thomas Crown Affair (1999). After a time, even the storyline line wasn't that emotional compelling or interesting to sustain any strong motivation to watch the movie, unlike the investigative reporting of All the President's Men (1976) or even Winter's Bone (2010) which gritty and riveting cultural milieu sustain a fascinating presence in the movie.Perhaps one of the best unusual characters, even though mainstream, but directed and emotionally absorbing was found in Terence Young's Wait Until Dark (1967) where Audrey Hepburn plays a blind woman who is stalked by some unsavory characters with the possibility of sadistic death on their minds. The ultimate crime thriller that sustains its action, has techno, and intimate relational balance remains Manhunter (1986) which captures unlike Dragon Tattoo some humanness of its horrendous criminal while at the times time provides that background character that seems missing in Dragon Tattoo.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Better than expected.,"I thought the Swedish Movie was outstanding. Wanted to see what Hollywood could do to make it better. Well I was surprised. I still think Noomi Rapace who plays Lisbeth in the Swedish version did a great job. However the US version is a great work, very close to the book, well directed well edited. Mara Rooney transformed Lisbeth into the Lisbeth of the book. So if you have read the book and seen the Swedish version and you like both of them then you will like the movie. I can see this being a classic and I can't wait to see the next 2 movies. Craig does his part very well.. But the star of the movie and the leading person really has to be Mara.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"Good movie, The story was good, But I feel some time bored, The movie can be shorter, The acting was good, Lisbeth Salander Character was so crazy, She made me sympathize with Psychologist, I recommend watching it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Broken Hero Rises,"Director David Fincher's ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is amazing. Rooney Mara is awesome as the Girl with the tattoo. She is a star. Mara inhabits Stieg Larsson's anti-hero hero Lisbeth Salander. ""The Girls with the Dragon Tattoo"" is one of the best movies of the year. My bud Neil cautioned me that the movie is 2 hours and 40 minutes, and slow in the beginning—to set up the context, and worth it. Daniel Craig is unrecognizably physically vulnerable and compelling as Mikael. I think Craig is the most threatening physical presence as James Bond; this is distinct contrast. He plays the tarnished writer seeking redemption, researching a 40 year-old murder of the cryptically dysfunctional Vanger family. Jeff Cronenweth's striking cinematography captures the existential bleakness. Trent Reznor's innovative score lyrically balances the foreboding narrative.Fincher gravitates toward the darker lurid human crevices. I squirmed watching his shockingly explicit sodomy scene. This derives from the source material. From one point of view, the pivotal character arc for Lisbeth forges familiar rage and calculated retribution. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" gleans on the surface unsavory—serial murder, and the aftermath of physical and sexual abuse. I was initially puzzled by Fincher's remake of movies based on Larsson's novels which were acclaimed. Fincher triumphs and his vision warranted. He exquisitely underlies the virtue of humanity amidst its brutal inhumanity.Set in the austere winter of Stockholm, Lisbeth is the tortured Goth savant researcher on retainer to an international security firm. Mara with Lisbeth's facial and body piercings, tattoos, and spiked black hair is not your typical corporate researcher. She is the genius biker computer hacker with both photographic and auditory memory. Fincher has subtle reveal as Lisbeth memorizes the door security code as she strolls by an apartment.Fincher, Mara and Steven Zaillian's screenplay hint at the haunting possible abuse that shrouds Lisbeth's past—she suppresses great fear and anger displaying compartmentalized focus. In a glimpse into her rage, Lisbeth brutally beats a robber with her kickboxing skills. I have been watching a lot of Dr. Drew. Apparently, a ward of the state, Lisbeth is a loner spending her time eating micro-waved cup noodles, while immersed in her cyber research tasks. One of those subjects was Mikael (Craig). Though apparent recluse, Lisbeth seeks out both men and women as lovers. Mara is magnetic. Lisbeth had a beloved guardian, who suffered a stroke. Her current guardian is creepy attorney Bjurman (Yorick van Wageningen), who leverages appalling favors from Lisbeth to access her family money.Mikael Blomkvist (Craig) is the disgraced financial journalist losing a libel case and his fortune to businessman Wennerstrom (slick charming Ulf Friberg). He is co-owner of Millennium magazine with his lover Erika Berger (strong Robin Wright)—both are married, to other partners. He has a grown daughter. Mikael resigns. Meanwhile, Frode (menacing Steven Berkoff), the family attorney for Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), patriarch of Vanger Industries, contacts Mikael with a curious offer. Plummer is brilliantly controlling and charismatic as the suffering Henrik. Every year he receives a pressed flower from anonymous sender. His niece Harriet had always sent him this gift; however, he believes she was murdered over 40 years ago when she vanished in 1966. She was 16 years old. Henrik wants Mikael to find the person, who murdered Harriet, who he believes is family. In return, he will pay handsomely and give Mikael critical information. Harriet's brother Martin (icy cool Stellan Skarsgard) is the smart and measured man, who is now CEO of Vanger Industries. Mikael lives in a cottage on the Vanger estate on Hedeby Island and operates under the guise of writing a Vanger biography. Mikael soon discovers the depth of the Vanger family dysfunction.Frode ironically connects Mikael with Lisbeth to further his research which is at an impasse. They know their own personal connection. Mikael says, ""I want you to help me catch a killer of women."" Their lives intersect and the twisted journey spirals down the dark path. Thankfully, there is light. Rooney Mara is powerful as the broken hero. Daniel Craig is amazing as the compassionate partner. Mara and Craig are such amazing actors, who capture fear, sadness, and surprise in their eyes. David Fincher tells the hero's story with graceful triumphs and muted losses. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is awesome.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Captivating...,"The only REAL person in this entire cast of characters was Salander. There were molesters, murderers, thieves, liars, criminals,abusers and dark personalities. It was Salander who seems to do the right thing among the monsters in society that surround her.Oh yeah... she had provocative behaviors, but the extreme ones were in response to the horrific adults who were in her life, horrific. Lisbeth had it right. A few years of peace and support... she would have figured it out.... a terrific mom, wife.What men want... really... is some one who will go to the extreme as she did to save her man, without asking, without him even knowing.That is just my opinion.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A Severely Underrated Film,"David Fincher is truly the master of book-to-movie adaptations. And with such a successful and dark book as The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo to work with, you'd think that this would be a recipe for success. So what did this movie lack to be so ignored and not talked about by the general public?Nothing. This movie lacked nothing. It is a beautiful display of acting, musical score, cinematography, and directing. The reason that this film is is unfairly underrated is because the wrong audience came to see it.The audience that came to see this movie had never seen a film like this before from David Fincher (because he had never done anything like this before). They came with the wrong expectations and as a result, they were unsatisfied. So what is the ""right"" audience?If you are one who likes extremely dark, demented movies that are driven purely by dialogue, disturbing imagery, and great directing and not by action or horror movie scares, then this movie will most certainly not disappoint.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Oscar-worthy, Best film of 2011!!","Wow, where to start? First I'll say that even if I rate many films as 10/10, this is one of those few whose real rating should be 1000/10.Solely the opening sequence is Oscar-Worthy. Atmosphere is so good, photography is a masterpiece, everything seams authentic, even more special mention of sound design and beautiful music score by Trent Raznor and Atticus Ross. Simply enchanting!I usually like thrillers and mysteries, but this one is even better. It's not only thriller, it's also drama and the characterization is strong and it shakes you all the time along. The plot actually contains two story lines, Vanger family and Lisbeth Salander, which eventually clash together, and each is fantastic by itself. Story is intriguing, it doesn't back out one bit from telling the ugly truth and it doesn't even soften it. It says straight in your face everything you need to know. With no sugar-coding at all.Acting performances are fantastic! Rooney Mara simply IS Lisbeth Salander, so emotional, autistic, fragile, yet strong, intelligent, independent young woman, who can easily be a role model to many young women who have had it rough in life. She literally transforms into the role, who uncompromisingly takes lemons life gave her and turns them into lemonade without second thought about it. She truly does deserve our respect, Lisbeth, and Rooney Mara, a lovely young actress with very bright future. I know it is unpredictable to say who will win Oscar, but she has my vote, and I know I'll be disappointed if she doesn't get nominated. Her performance is hand to hand with Heath Ledger as the Joker, and my personal favorite film ever so far is The Dark Knight, so I know what I'm saying.Daniel Craig is also amazing as Mikael Blomkvist and quite different than in Bond movies, proving he is a great actor. Stellan Skarsgard, Christopher Plummer and Joely Richardson are especially good in this stellar award-winning cast and if any of them receives Supporting actor/actress Oscar nomination, it will be very much deserved. All episodic cast is also superb, notable mention goes to Geraldine James, Per Myrberg, Alan Dale and Goran Visnjic. Everybody was just... AMAZING!So, David Fincher's film is a masterpiece which will not be forgotten in movie history! It is shocking, emotional, deep, clever and realistic, it won't leave anyone indifferent. I would give it more that 10/10 if I could and I know I'll buy a double DVD when it comes out.Only thing left to say is... I can't wait for The Girl Who Played With Fire to be made and I hope it will be soon. If it is as half as good as this one, it will still get 10/10 from me.Recommendation to see!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Way Better than the Original,"OMG. Hollywood got something really really right. I was not a fan of the original movie, but a big fan of the book. And I loved this adaptation. Brilliantly casted; from Blomkvist to Salander; the awkwardness captured as one would expect. Key plots are examined and counted for unlike the original. OK, so it's not 'word for word' so to speak, but in turning 500 pages into 2 1/2 hrs worth of film, one could expect that. I was worried at having to sit through another confronting effort of sexual violence, but this was done quite well in that I didn't feel like reaching for the bucket.

One of the top three movies in 2011,"I have to say that like most people I hadn't heard of the Millennium series or Stieg Larsson before his death. Upon hearing all the fuss about the books I wanted to see for myself if this was one of those posthumous things. Well as many of you know it wasn't and the three books are some of the very best in their kind. Now I have read them and have recommended them almost to anyone I know and asks me about a good book.That said about the books before watching the American version (and having watched the Swedish versions) I have to admit I was expecting to be disappointed in that I didn't expect it to be better or even the same as its Swedish counterpart. Well it was one of the best movies I saw in 2011 along with Drive.Some people say that it does not smell of Sweden. Well the movie is a Hollywood film, and you can't expect from someone not of Swedish culture to depict aspects of Sweden as they truly are (they even forgot that Sweden uses Celcius and not Fahrenheit). If you judge the movie objectively and without having in mind the books and how much stuff from the books are missing as I hear a lot (which is true but also shouldn't matter) you will see that this movie as what it truly is, a thriller that won't let you stop watching even for a minute.I also heard a lot that the movie has a lot of sex scenes and more nudity than it should. Well to those people I say that you are going to watch a thriller describing some of the darkest aspects of the human soul and mind so you can't expect unicorns and fairies except if they were carrying shotguns. I won't go as far to say that nudism is a form of art, I leave that to history to judge, but I truly didn't mind about the sex and nude scenes in this movie.Enough of review other people's thoughts about the movie though. Rooney Mara is exceptional playing as Lisbeth Salander dark and showing that feeling of ambivalence we all have for her actions and truly deserves her nomination. Daniel Craig showed that he in not only good as James Bond but is capable of great emotion as well. All the cast performed very well and David Fincher used their assets to make an excellent film.All in all I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has read the books or has seen the Swedish adaptations of the books and wants to compare, or anyone who wants to see a good thriller and an excellent movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
dark and absorbing,"I wasn't sure if I was going to like this movie at the beginning. The film was gray and had a murky quality, and the first characters I saw were too understated and a little mumbly. I was also a little unclear as to what was happening at first.As the movie progressed, it became a little more interesting. It became darker. Then it introduced a mystery, which made somewhat centered it. Then it got much darker still.As the movie moved along, I was increasingly drawn in. Many of the things that had initially put me off - Daniel Craig's understated performance, the deliberate pacing, the oppressive, almost monochromatic style - started to fit together nicely.The movie winds up working for a number of different reasons. The dragon-tattoo girl is an intriguing character who has most of the best scenes in the movie. The mystery is well done (although it follows a not-unusual mystery-book path) and the movie does a nice job of making slogging through old documents interesting, mainly by focusing on photographic evidence. The movie extends in both directions past the mystery itself, which makes the characters more than just detectives.While it probably took me a half hour before I was sure I was going to stick with the movie, by the end I was ready for the sequel.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Falls short of hopes, but not expectations","I will confess that I have not read the book. I tried to listen to it on a cross country trip with my daughter of 25, but some scenes were a bit sexually graphic and we jointly agreed to bag it. That said, I have seen both the Swedish version and American remake. Give me the voice over Swedish version, please.Is it just me or do others look at Daniel Craig and see him sitting naked on a bottomless chair asking a man with a rope and ball to scratch an itch down there. I'm sorry, but this was one of the worst casting jobs of a starring role I have ever seen. Craig is simply not believable in the role of a magazine publisher. Next is Lisbeth Salander played by Rooney Mara. Though Mara does a fine job as Lisbeth, there is so little depth to the character that I didn't care about her or what happened to her at all; OK I didn't care about Blomkvist either. The Swedish version provides clips of her past to partially explain why she is as she is. I came to care for what happened to that Lisbeth. Mikael's character is also much more defined in the Swedish version.The two plots follow along pretty much the same path, but this version seems to be so utterly devoid of character development it feels like Martin's kitchen, sanitary and devoid of any decoration. Even Christopher Plummer falls short, and he never does that. Without the character development I felt like I was watching a movie instead of experiencing it. There is no emotional attachment as there is in the original.I rated it a six only by refusing a comparison with the original. In comparison, I'd give it a 1.

Sitting on the Fence,"Following the incredible success (both critically and commercially) of the 2009 Swedish trilogy of Stieg Larrson's novels, Hollywood jumped on the bandwagon to offer a version that is more accessible to those who hate subtitles.Having enjoyed the Swedish version, I was very sceptical that Daniel Craig and co. could improve on the story. But, credit where credit is due; having read the books, the American version follows the story far more accurately than its Scandinavian counterpart.Usually when adapting a novel, making it as close to the book storyline is a sure-fire way to win over those that are fiercely loyal to the author, but for some reason this adaptation is missing something. Daniel Craig is not too bad as Blomkvist, and contrary to what I thought before I watched it, he actually shakes the James Bond image easily.A big problem though is Rooney Mara's Salander. Both her and Noomi Rapace (the Swedish Salander) correctly keep the female protagonist cold and secluded which is the big appeal to the unique character. But, the book makes a big deal of Salander ultimately having morals, no matter how far removed they are from normal. As a result, Rapace makes her Salander amiable whilst Mara just makes hers repulsive.This difference in the Salander interpretation isn't the only thing that's different in the cultural representation. The American version attempts to retain the Swedish locations and, to an extent, the Swedish accent. Despite enjoying the inclusion of various Swedish actors it occasionally had me reaching again for the subtitles.As a result, this film sits on the fence as to whether to stick or twist. Should it aim for the hardcore fans? I think there was a missed opportunity for reaching out to those who had never been acquainted with the series before. Perhaps setting the film in American might have worked, like it did for Get Carter. Perhaps not. Rather than just going for revenues, why not just take a chance? As I said, credit where credit is due. It's not appalling, and its not appealing. It's a film that right down the middle. Right on the fence.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Dragon Tattoo is excellent but not a Masterpiece like Swedish pehonomanan,"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo – CATCH IT (A-) The Novel and Swedish version"" Män som hatar kvinnor/The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" with Noomi Rapace is a worldwide phenomena. There is no doubt that this is one of the most complicated and complex novel hitting the shelves last decades. Presenting the novel with all its complexities to the big screen is challenging, the Swedish director Niels Arden Oplev did a fantastic job with the first novel into a feature movie. Now it was David Fincher's turn to adopt the novel for American audiences with Rooney Mara and transfer into something close to or surpass the original phenomena with Noomi Rapace. Now I defiantly can say that David Fincher has done a fantastic job with American ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" but I cannot say that it's better than the original. Original is a classic masterpiece and Noomi Rapace deadly portray of Lisbeth Slander will go down in the history. If you compare both movies there is some difference like the characterization of Lisbeth Slander and Mikael Blomkvist. In Swedish version Lisbeth is fierce and doesn't show her emotions to anyone. Though in American version Lisbeth is more emotional and in the end her chasing down to Mikael Blomkvist shows her romantic side which was missing both in books and Swedish version. Maybe it was more David's attempt for American audiences to except her. I don't think it was a bad think because it gives it a decent romantic angel which is never a bad thing. Other major difference is Swedish Mikael is looks older though American Mikael is the roughed hot man in his best age. No wonder American Lisbeth falls for him. Noomi Rapace is indeed the winner as Lisbeth but it doesn't mean Rooney Mara is in anyway less. She did a fantastic job as Lisbeth Salander, her Oscar nod and stardom is totally worth it. Rooney Mara has shown how an average looking girl can crush all the odds of success. Not for a second she looked like a starlet, she defiantly lived the character really well. Daniel Craig is really charismatic and pin perfect as Mikael Blomkvist. Robin Wright is alright. Joel Kinnaman has non speaking part. Christopher Plummer and Stellan Skarsgard are great in it. Overall, David Fincher has directed an excellent movie in all aspects. The Girl with Dragon Tattoo has detailed and intriguing story and enticing performances to entertain us.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
An unrelenting and intense thriller; another Fincher masterpiece.,"Those that thought David Fincher couldn't pull off the impossible – creating a worthy remake of the much loved Swedish Dragon Tattoo only two years after it itself was released – thought wrong. Fincher has added another indelibly powerful body of work to his already amazing CV; somewhere above Panic Room and Benjamin Button but slightly below Zodiac, Seven, Fight Club and The Social Network. With a tone-setting opening credits sequence – one of the best I've ever witnessed – and a darkly atmospheric score by regular collaborators Trent Reznor and Atticus Finch, the U.S. TGWTDT is an unrelenting and intense thriller that had me on the edge of my seat despite knowing the bulk of the narrative twists and turns (some of which have been altered from the original). But what of the cast you ask? Well, comparing the new and old portrayals of the titular inked female – by Rooney Mara and Noomi Rapace respectively – doesn't generate a clear winner, only how different they actually are. Where Rapace played it physically stronger, mentally clearer and emotionally detached, Mara is less physically imposing, mentally weaker but emotionally more in control. Daniel Craig on the other hand is a much more engaging Blomkvist than Michael Nyqvist, and, most importantly, the chemistry he shares with Mara is more convincing and tangible than that of the Swede duo. This really is the ""feel bad movie of the year"" that the posters suggested thanks to the impressive cast and crew, and one that will have both fans and newcomers enthralled.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The Girl with the Insanely Good Movie,"***1/2 out of (****)After waiting an impeccably long time for ""Tattoo"" to get the ball rolling into cinemas, a strong critical reception was promised. And I got that, but something was odd. Fincher's films typically are critically acclaimed with a solid praise, almost promising it's THE movie of the year (""The Social Network"", ""Benjamin Button"", and ""Zodiac"" anyone?). This..., this just got some solid word-of-mouth but strangely enough, no actual hoopla. With a more than prosperous book trilogy and Sweden film collection, how does Fincher's glossy and more polished, Americanized version stack up?""Tattoo"" revolves around our central protagonist Lisbeth, played by the iconic Rooney Mara teams up with the co-star of the show, Daniel Craig. Together, they are on the hunt for the missing Harriet, who vanished nearly half a century ago.Clocking in at an excessive 158 minutes, never once does this film drop the ball or lose its steam. Boasting an elaborate and rather oily opening credits sequence, what a way to kick off such a mesmerizing movie-going experience. First off, the performances here are just astonishing to say the least. Craig and Mara are the pitch perfect detective duo and give it their all. I can smell some Academy nominations. Moreover, the script of this film is extremely well written, with various amounts of attention to detail. And how the script is executed? Very competent, with every ounce of the script being projected in its fullest potential.Now where this film shines is rather in the star power. Throughout the film, Lisbeth and Craig's character undergo this intimate love triangle (if you want to even call it that) and makes things especially interesting. But, speaking of intimate and personal, how is the much talked about rape scene? With all the buzz revolving around the three minute tragedy, I can definitely say I've seen worse, but this was still pretty brutal to watch. Don't get me wrong, rape is never an easy subject to touch on, but the execution here was just disturbing and gut- wrenching.What about the score? Just the cherry on top. Trent Reznor fails to disappoint with this eerie and mostly engaging soundtrack. It definitely enhances this film on all levels. And last but not least, the cinematography is some of the best I've seen. The shots are simply beautiful and when there isn't your fair share of sex, rape, or violence going on, the atmosphere is definitely one to suck you in.If there was a complaint I would have, it would be the pacing. The first two hours are paced brilliantly, with Fincher directed a very evenly paced and coherent picture. But those last 30+ minutes are edited just very choppy and it goes off the rails a bit after a smooth transition between the hours.All in all, Fincher has another winner on its hands. The acting, the visuals, the plot, it's all there and it's all quite extraordinary. Is this movie as mind-blowing and earth-shattering as the hype persuades you to be? That's up to you, but personally, it didn't. But what we have here is still a solid picture that is more than deserving to be on a Top 10 list or two. We shall soon meet again Fincher.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A powerfully done story,"I won't add any spoilers as this is too good a movie to spoil. So how do I review it? We'll give it a shot. This is primarily about the American film.First, if you have not read the book OR seen the original Swedish film, do not do either. We take it for granted that the book is always better than the film - and that is certainly true in this case. But if you read the book first it will spoil the film, so by all means read the book, but read it after you see the film; both films. The original Swedish film is outstanding in all respects.I have a great suggestion for the world of filmmaking: The next time you find yourself with such a stunning book to make into a film, get together the American and Foreign interests and make the films side-by-side. It would drastically reduce the overall costs and just as drastically shorten the production schedule. Then you release the finished films; the US version to the US and the other version to the rest of the world.First, the story is not for the feint hearted, it's brutal at times and portrays the seamier side of humanity very graphically. The story hit most of the important stuff so there's no shortage of material. The film runs three hours, but it doesn't seem like it. The pacing and energy in it is sufficient to keep your attention. That means the writing was very good too, as was the directing. The overall film struck me unmistakably as a modern film noir. The cinematography reflects great skill and is responsible for making the film even better. The camera had great scenery to chew up and it was given delicious sets and beautiful weather to set the mood. It won't disappoint.The actors chosen to work on this project were well cast and all were excellent in their portrayals. Daniel Craig gave the character believability and a sympathetic demeanor. The young woman chosen to portray Lisbeth Salander was Rooney Mara. Mara was excellent in a very demanding role. She had to subject herself to depictions of violent victimization of the worst kind and managed to make it feel very real. I think Ms. Rooney has a great future in film if someone can find her the right parts. This part was a perfect fit for it. She really makes the movie, but as the title character she should. My only complaint at all was that the sound people didn't quite manage to make all of her spoken dialog clear in spite of the accent she adopted. The accent and her manner of delivering it were quite remarkable.All in all it's an excellent film of this genre and I was glad to have seen it.By Bruce L.

A fantastic film that can be overwhelming at times.,"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo was new to me from the start. I had heard of the books, but never knew what they were about. When I got around to watching the trailer I was instantly hooked. It looked mysterious and violent and seemed to have a very unique cast...I couldn't have been more satisfied.I'm sure if you haven't seen this movie already you have heard of a few choice scenes from people who have. They might've described them in detail, but it doesn't do the movie any justice until you actually witness them yourself. TGWTDT pushes you to the edge and pulls you back in for more. You never know whats going to happen, and things often happen too quickly and that's the way it should be. This movie has it all: mystery, romance, betrayal, violence, suspense, you name it. Its probably there.Don't sleep on this one, you wont be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Better than expected but not as good as the Swedish version,"I expected very little from this American version of the Swedish movie.The Swedish version was thrilling, chilling and Lisbeth Salander amazing as a character.The American version was better than expected. I thought Rooney Mara did OK, however the interpretation of Mikael Blomkvist was disappointing and detached. The story line was changed many times were it just didn't make sense to make the changes. It let the air out of the story and left it more boring to watch.The story between Lisbeth and Bjurmann was a big let-down. Especially considering how important it is for the next two movies. The Swedish version was scary and shocking and I did not get that feeling in the American version at all.Also the solving of the murder mystery was not as entertaining and it did not provide the creepy feeling from the original movie.All in all - it was an OK movie. If not compared to the original - it did well, but if compared - it disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Mix of Seven and Social Network,This movie was quite exceptionally done. It has a really compelling story that keeps going deeper and deeper. There isn't a whole lot of action in this but when there is it is explosive. If you like any other David Fincher movies chances are this will keep you engaged until the very end. Lots of dialog with a big mystery revolving around the whole movie. Rooney Mara is amazing at portraying Lisbeth and Daniel Craig is genius as always. Christopher Plumber has picked another great movie to act in. In the end this is by far Fincher's best film so everyone go see it and be ready to be disgusted and amazed.

Oh what a led balloon of a movie!,"Having seen the original trilogy, this lame Sunday school version is a joke. Awkward acting, poor story-line, bad directing, cutting and sound...quite honestly I could just go on and on. There was absolutely nothing I would rate highly in this Tinseltown version of the true original. Fake Swedish accent speaking, ugly and unsympathetic actors running around from A to B without any sense of continuation in the story- line or script. If I hadn't seen the original first, I would have been really confused. Is the US audience really so different that they had to have their own Disney version? I have seen dozens of European classics turned in to this kind of mush. After the story is squeezed through a one size fits all machine of the Hollywood industry, all the goodness and taste has been removed to leave bite size, easy to digest goop with just a hint of added coloring and flavoring.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

not a spoiler Compelling Film!,"Something happened near the end of the film that I cannot discuss here, which was crucial to my understanding of this film, and I do not know where to go to discuss what can only be seen as a total spoiler, unless you don't see or understand the same way I do. First I had to be captivated by the main characters; then I had to start moving with them through the film. I have only watched the film once. Then I started looking into it. David Fincher, Daniel Craig, and Rooney Mara were unfolding before my eyes. Maybe you can understand that I do not have time for the research, but the film was compelling. Soon the book and the reviews for the 2009 film began to demand that I need to do more work to be entitled to an opinion. Nope! The art of watching a film has to be active on a first view of a film, if I never see it again, and I have to be able to see the production values of a film, an advertisement, or a trailer if I want to appreciate what I am looking at and where I want to go with it. There are many seasoned writers and film viewer represented here. No one is allowed to talk about a point that seems essential to one of interpersonal dynamics so well handled in this psychological dark thriller..",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Quite excellent,"I have seen the original and this, but never read the books, but I don't think it matters. I think original had a bit more darkness and raw brutality (if one can even say that), but this version has a but of a happy ending, a bit of redemption, and a bit of happiness, if that's even possible...Rooney Mara really goes all out, from piercing her parts, to learning how to ride a bike, to full frontal, where even a bit of an angle would have sufficed. Much respect to her for that, as it really showed her characters trust and an ability to open up to a man, in that way, after her turbulent past experience with older men...Overall, I think the main leads have great chemistry and I think the ending, messes with that, because it was done that way to set up part 2 and 3, and since they are not happening, there needs to be a directors cut to remove, the last 30 seconds... It's really a pity, because one can see that he found a fiercely loyal friend for life; and last 30 seconds cast doubt to that.9/10 for sure.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
An excellent movie adaptation of a very good book .,"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a 2011 Swedish-American mystery thriller film based on the novel of the same name by Stieg Larsson. This film adaptation was directed by David Fincher and written by Steven Zaillian. Starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara.Mikael Blomkvist is a financial journalist who has been convicted of libel after writing and publishing an article about billionaire financier Hans-Erik Wennerström, that was proved in court to have faulty evidence. After Blomkvist resigns from his position at Millennium Magazine, he is approached by Henrik Vanger for his assistance. Vanger asks him to officially write his memoirs, but to unofficially investigate the dissaperance of his niece, Harriet Vanger, that occurred over 40 years ago. Salander is a ward of the state due to a declaration of incompetence. As Blomkvist begins to investigate the massive Vanger family he realizes he has need for assistance, thus prompting Henrik Vanger to hire Salandar. As the two investigate deeper and deeper into the history of the Vanger family they discover secrets about more than they ever expected.I liked this movie. The direction by David Fincher was very executed, there were times where I thought that the movie was a little slow or boring but it is David Fincher directing this. The script sticks a little more closer to the original source material that was written by the author Steig Larsson, but the screenplay is written by Steve Zaillian.The musical score is composed by Trent Renzor and Atticus Ross, who won an Oscar for the 2010 film, ""The Social Network"", also starred Mara and directed by David Fincher, who also directed another one of my crime thriller favorites, ""Seven"", starring Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman and the opening title sequence just blew me away, I could not believe that the title sequence alone told me what kind of film this was going to be and looking at the trailer itself, I remembered what kind of film this was.The acting is superb. Daniel Craig plays Mikael Blomkvist and he does a good job with the role, but he feels like he's acting like James Bond in a few scenes. Stellan Skarsgaard and Yorick van Wagnengian as the antagonists of the two main characters are just creepy. Robin Wright Penn was really good as Erika Berger. I liked the rest of the cast too, especially Joely Richardson and Christopher Plummer.Now, let me talk about Rooney Mara, who plays the girl with the dragon tattoo herself, Lisbeth Salander. I like Rooney Mara and her sister Kate as actresses and I have not seen Rooney Mara in ""The Social Network"", but I will say that she was kind of bad in the Freddy Krueger remake as Nancy, but I will defend her and say that she tried. Mara, as Lisbeth, is really good and she's better than Noomi Rapace, who played Lisbeth in the original trilogy, but Rooney Mara, she poured everything into this role, from getting piercings, getting the tattoos put on her, and even kissing James Bond himself, Daniel Craig. She deserved to win that Oscar and I am so upset that she didn't get it.I would definitely be interested in seeing the other two novels be directed by Fincher and starred Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig as the two main characters, but I still have to read the other two books in the series.Overall, I'm giving The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo a perfect score of 10 out of 10, it does have some things I hated, but I still think this was a really good interesting and entertaining film. This is the definition of an excellent movie adaptation of a very good book directed by one of the greatest directors of all time, David Fincher with an awesome screenplay, musical score and superb acting from everyone including the two powerhouse performances from Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

The identity of the villain is pretty obvious.I have to say that I found this film to be extremely and relentlessly boring. The story could have been told in half of the running time allocated to this film.The less than charismatic actors don't help either. Rooney Mara is better but she has a more interesting character.

I had planned to read the book trilogy. No more. Daniel Craig did a good job. The title character, his assistant, the girl with the tattoos and facial piercings was too bizarre to be believable. There were too many scenes of sex and torture. The plot also was bizarre. The author's anti- Nazi bias was evident. I don't recommend the film. I rated it at 6* only because of the good photography and acting by Daniel Craig. Instead,see the similar film, Ne le dis à personne (France, 2006) 8* AKA Tell No One, for a better film with a sympathetic protagonist.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A brilliant reinterpretation through the lens of David Fincher,"I watched this movie before I ever saw the original Swedish Trilogy and I loved it. Then again, this movie was directed by David Fincher and I love all the movies this man has directed, Alien 3 (1992) not withstanding. So, I decided to give this movie a rewatch after watch the original trilogy and I actually prefer this movie over the original version.Positives for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011):
The thing that I love about this movie is the fact that it's being presented to us through the lens of David Fincher. The story is a lot darker and grimier than it was in the original. The mystery and the events surrounding this family is very interesting and the journey that you go on is very intense and thrilling. It also goes without saying that both Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara are phenomenal in this movie as the characters of Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander respectively. I will also say that I prefer Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander over Noomi Rapace and the fact that she didn't win the Oscar for Best Actress really infuriates me because she deserved it. I also prefer Daniel Craig as Mikael Blomkvist over Michael Nyqvist as he adds more lairs to this character. And finally, I love the way that Lisbeth Salander takes down the villain of Wennerstrom and it was so satisfying for me.Mixed for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011):
These are sequences in this movie that are very hard to watch, which is something to be expected whenever you have David Fincher in the director's chair. Thankfully, the payoff to these scenes are very satisfying and had me rejoice with so much happiness. And finally, it sucks that this movie isn't getting a sequel because I wanted to see more of this story through David Fincher's lens, but for what this singular movie presents to us is good enough for me.Overall, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) is an absolutely brilliant American version of this story and it's one of the few examples of taking a premise from a foreign movie and amplifying to greater heights.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"A mostly pointless film, but well-made and gripping","I always thought an English redo of TGWTDT (or the Men Who Hate Woman as the original Swedish novel is clumsily titled) was utterly pointless. From watching the end result you'll be mystified as to where the $90 million budget went (the 2009 version cost $13 million). Thankfully the movie itself offers a bigger mystery to distract you from that, but globally the 2009 movie was far more successful and made more money. It seems that $90 million was spent simply to appeal to Americans who couldn't be bothered reading subtitles.The story is mostly the same to Niels Arden Oplev's interpretation, with a few relatively minor deviations and contractions. Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig, not even bothering to attempt a Swedish accent) is disgraced journalist who is hired by Henrik Vanger, a wealthy old businessman, to solve the 40-year-old disappearance of his favorite niece Harriet. He takes the job to keep busy while his name and reputation turns to mud.Mikael throws himself head-first into the case but soon requires an assistant and so he recruits Lisbeth Salander, a misanthropic genius who did the background check on him. Together they uncover decades of dark family secrets and the wrath of a still active killer.Like Niels Arden Oplev before him, David Fincher almost gets the balance between visual and verbal storytelling right, but loses his grasp on the multiple characters and references to dates, places, and people. Some of the dialogue that should orientate the viewer regarding such things is too quiet, quick, and mumbled. Inattentive viewers will not find this film easy to follow. It does however have far superior photography to the 2009 version, which I thought looked flat and plain and was shot nasty Super-35. Fincher's incarnation is shot in lovely 5K Redcode RAW and is far superior when it comes to atmosphere and mood.Not exactly a film to watch with your grandparents (curiously, the screening I went to was filled with OAPs) but a solid mystery for grown-ups who want something deeper than the average episode of CSI.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Surely this is a joke?,"Watching Fincher's remake was so much like deja vu that I wondered if the director had simply employed CGI artists to superimpose American and English faces over Swedish ones. I also wondered how Hollywood gets away with this level of grotesque artistic plagiarism. Niels Arden Oplov must surely be outraged because this is more his film than Fincher's. This is a remake with absolutely no creative effort put in-except for those appallingly unnecessary and unconvincing faux-Swedish accents. Why even bother? All I can think is Fincher was under contract to make his film identical to Oplov's, but using English language.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

A Rare Example of A Hollywood Remake Done Right.,"It's not very often that you come across a Hollywood remake that's almost as amazing as the original film & in that particular aspect, David Fincher's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a winner. Dark, brutal, sinister yet intensely engaging & viciously entertaining, the film is crafted with sublime aggressiveness from start to finish & also marks Fincher's return to the genre he does better than anyone else.Based on Stieg Larsson's novel of the same name, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo concerns Mikael Blomkvist; a disgraced journalist who's hired by a wealthy businessman to investigate the disappearance & assumed murder of his grandniece, which happened 40 years ago. As he delves deeper into the family's history & tries to connect the dots, he recruits the help of Lisbeth Salander; a young computer hacker who has dark secrets of her own.Ingeniously directed by David Fincher, the first impression is made in the opening moments only for the title sequence is a work of marvellous creativity, which puts the viewers in just the right mood for the dark journey that lies ahead. Screenplay is penned down by Steven Zaillian, who does a good job in providing a cohesive structure to the whole plot, keeps it faithful enough to its source material & also handles the characterization part pretty well.Coming to the technical aspects, Fincher's version of the first chapter in the Millennium Trilogy is far superior to its Swedish counterpart in every manner. Set pieces are painstakingly detailed, Cinematography makes precise use of colour tones, camera-work, detailing & lighting, Editing is smoothly carried out, and the unsettling score by Trent Reznor & Atticus Rose perfectly captures the ominous ambiance of the story with its eerie tracks.As far as performances go, the film features a reliable cast in Daniel Craig, Rooney Mara, Stellan Skarsgård, Christopher Plummer & others, with Craig & Mara impressing the most. Craig never lets his James Bond persona affect his performance here & is very convincing as Blomkvist while Mara is a revelation in the coveted role of Lisbeth Salander, is easily the strongest character in the film & her on-screen chemistry with Craig is instantly likable.Compared to the Swedish film adaptation, I've to say that this one is slightly inferior in its overall impact. The violence in the original was far more emotionally affecting, and even Noomi Rapace was a better Lisbeth than Mara is, though by no means does it mean I didn't love the latter's performance. Where this remake triumphs is in providing a far better visual & sound design but it never really brings anything new in the storytelling department.On an overall scale, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo plays remarkably well to David Fincher's strengths & by every means is an English-language remake done right, despite the few nitpicks. The character of Lisbeth alone is enough to keep you invested into its dark story & the unflinching portrayal of its disturbing themes also works out in its favour. Definitely worth a shot, this fascinating meditation on evil comes highly recommended.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A delightful movie,"Typical example of delightful movie - the one that awe you a sense of real horror with some brutal , sinful scenes which are more than you can take but you can't stop watching them - you just desire to see the end.

The total role commitment from the star Rooney Mara is captivating - undoubtedly that is her movie. Crime, mystery and suspense that stay with you to the end.

I found that the actors played their parts exactly as portrayed in the book. All the plot points were done well.

Well-executed particularly given some tough source material,"David Fincher of the brilliant ""Fight Club"" is to be congratulated in his success in translating Steig Larsson's smartypants, hyper-violent, dank steampunk novel into an entertaining movie. One wishes Ron ""Opie"" Howard could have shown the same skill in his dismal filming of the Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code"". Fincher does not shy away from presenting the convoluted, vicious story of intrigue in the very foreign country of Sweden as written. This trust in the material, which Howard did not show, reveals an acceptance of the fact that this story was inexplicably popular among book clubbing housewives. Fincher presses the accelerated right from the beginning and does not let up through the entire 2 and 1/2 hour run-time risking losing viewers as the twists of the mystery unfold. Although tough to follow and often tough to watch the intriguing story winds up like a really good episode of ""The X-Files"". Also to be congratulated is the Academy of Arts and Sciences who recognized that newcomer Rooney, quite literately, put her all into what is ultimately an unpleasant and unattractive character. It was a nomination and maybe even an award that was well-deserved. Daniel Craig, who need to carry the film given the constraints of the largely non-verbal Salandar character, makes for a passable Blumquist. Stockholm native Stellan Skarsgard excels portraying a mixture of bourgeoisie charm and generational psychopathy. In short, it's a tough sit but a rewarding one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Good crime thriller,"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is the second adaptation of the original trilogy work by Stieg Larssen, sadly a posthumous work. Confused? Allow me to explain. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, this adaptation from 2011, is the second major adaptation from Larssen's book. The first one wasThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2009), directed by Niels Arden Oplev and starring Noomi Rapace. We can think of this version in 2011 as the high-budget version.The premise is what you'd expect from good crime thrillers. Disgraced journalist Mikael Blomkvist accepts chasing down the true events that led to the disappearance and eventual rule-of-death of Harriet Vagner, from the mighty corporate Vagner Family, businessmen that pretty much hate each other in every way possible. To assist him, Mikael ends up getting help of a mentally unstable and lightly disturbed hacker women called Lisbeth.This movie's story starts off with a great prologue, like in the book. Quickly, we are brought to terms with what this movie is all about, an interesting crime investigation is about to unfold.Right after the intriguing prologue, we meet one of our protagonists, Mikael Blomkvist, which Daniel Craig interprets. As of 2011, Daniel Craig had already been James Bond twice and was probably ending filming or waiting post-production of Skyfall; Daniel was already the Bond face, and that is a hard stamp to remove out of his play. Mikael has that Bond-y vibe which might work, but, because I didn't read the book yet, I can't say if he really depicts Mikael Blomkvist as Mr. Larssen envisioned.Regardless, Daniel Craig is a competent actor, and Mikael is likeable enough for us to care.Soon enough, the story introduces its second protagonist, Lisbeth Salander, who Rooney Mara plays. I don't have recollection of knowing Rooney from other major work, but Rooney does the job in this movie. She is definitely putting her heart into the character, and this dedication pays off. Lisbeth stands at that terrible line where her life is so messed up that we want to see her succeed, and Rooney's acting touch was top-notch. Lisbeth as a character herself has a good development throughout the story.As the story progresses, we get the good trends from the crime genre. The investigation unfolds in clever ways with everyone being a possible suspect. The good cast of supporting characters adds no room for easy speculation, where you can predict the culprit because of a highly known actor. No, in this movie, all actors are high-grade, and you should suspect everyone.Focusing strongly in this movie without comparing it to the book, we see that the story focuses heavily on harsh themes. Misogyny seems to be the central theme, displayed even by Mikael's implicit actions. Some scenes are quite graphic and hard to watch.Other themes involve family secrets in general, again seen not only in the Vagner family but also in Mikael, and abuse, physical and emotional, this theme stronger on Lisbeth and the crimes in place.Christianity is also a smaller theme, though the movie does not explore it in depth.David Fincher directs this movie. Known for Seven, Zodiac, Gone Girl, and recently The Killer, David is not a newbie when it comes to driving a crime thriller, adapted from books or not.The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is slow-driven, the story focusing on the investigation that unfolds. The sense of danger is imminent, the feeling that things are about to go awry. The editing work is overall okay for the movie's genre; the same is true for the soundtrack.The scenery is the beautiful landscape of Sweden during winter. Everything is covered in snow, the extreme cold a topic on most characters' mouth, a good connection to the overall cold-hearted motivates behind the antagonist.150 minutes later, you get to an ending that adds closure to this story and room for other stories. The ending is satisfying enough if we consider the closed arcs.All in all, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a recommendable crime thriller with good story development and progression, characters, and plot arc. The story is entertaining for its long 150 minutes of length, and the conclusion adds to the desire of wanting to watch the sequel,The Girl in the Spider's Web (2018).",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Best thriller in recent memory!,"Hands down! Even rumors popping up about replace the cast with a lower budget to make its way through box office, I'm not worry anymore. This movie will stand at its own as one of the greatest and best crafted thrillers in recent memory and a masterpiece of storytelling and flow. David Fincher was the ideal director to make this adaptation with a properly dark style and operatic quality. Daniel Craig may stand out in this role as his second best known aside 007. But Rooney Mara is the best stuff. She's priceless, since the physical transformation to her own performance (more aggressive, more seductive, deeper and with a better yet tragic closure). Even the movie could expand its world (from the source novel) or close the chapter on its own as the finale shows. Whatever it happens in the future, this movie will be as rock-solid as hell.

Fincher's comeback film,"There have been many films this year that have caught interest in many. With the film 'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo', directed by Fight Club director, David Fincher, many fans of the book that the film's based on were cautious, since there has been a Swedish film that was faithful to the fist book of three. I, myself, was as cautious as them, only it was due to Fincher's last film, 'The Social Network'. Many had been pleased with the film about Facebook creator, Mark Zuckerberg, mostly due to being users of the site. Even though I've used the site as well, I can't help but feel that the film had lacked much character into this and that Eisenberg, who portrayed Zuckerberg in the film, gave a performance of a golden toaster; might look impressive, but there's not much to it. Now with David Fincher's newest film, what can be said about it. Well, it can easily be past as a much better film than Social Network will be to me.With what the story goes, Daniel Craig plays Mikael Blomkvist, co-owner and author for Millennium Magazine, and is now being hired to solve the case of the disappearance of the great niece of Henrik Vanger, played by Christopher Plummer. While finding some clues, he then calls upon Lisbeth Salander, played by Rooney Mara, to help him out, all while developing a strong relationship together. For being one of my most anticipated movies of the year, I had high hopes thinking it would be one of the best films I've seen this year, with all the hype it's been getting. But alas, it's not as much as they say it to be. Granted, it wasn't anywhere CLOSE to bad, but it was still kinda underwhelming. Though, I still would watch this more times and find it more developed than 'The Social Network', even if 'Dragon Tattoo' is two hours and forty minutes long. The performances delivered by each of the actors was well done and didn't in the slightest bore me, with much suspense given to the story, and not once using jumps to scare the everliving pants off us. It takes it's time with it, bringing up to the strong ending that the characters will have to deal with. Even though I never read the book, nor did I watch the Swedish versions, I found it to still be a good film at the least.Overall, 'Girl With the Dragon Tattoo' is an exciting thriller with excellent acting from a great cast of people, and with some scenes, you'd know why they would give this film an 'R' rating. It's not done so much, to what most comedies today want to do, but in the essence of making an exciting thriller.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A thank you to the prolific reviewers who read the books and reflected.,"Often times, as a novice reviewer, it is necessary when seeing a movie that was years ago set in your memory, the tendency for one being tempted to read first from experienced writers because of bolstering your memory about a well told story, proved successful here. I knew this sequence of events in the movie, even for an adult, can be better served with a head's up about sensitive material from a reliable source. Being grateful, especially in this movie, with an international perspective of remakes, tells someone with clarity, that it should be worthy of your time. For those who read quite a bit, this movie fits the bill no matter how well the subjective nature of film reviewing might be. The keywords given are all well addressed in the IMDb community. Thank you kindly for the opportunity of empirically reading how well prolific reviewers are ranked. It is much appreciated during an epic time in history where many of us are at home and relying on the written word during a global pandemic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Still not the book, but a bit better...","I know it is always difficult to be faithful to the book, but I viewed it on the basis that if I hadn't read the plot, would I have understood everything. Both my wife and I agreed that it was difficult to follow on that basis.I do give it credit for being better than the Swedish version which was raved about at the time, but I'm afraid that that one was even more confusing.In the Swedish version it did not explore enough the relationship being built up with Lisbeth and Mikael.I felt the US version was better with the casting, and I found Lisbeth very believable in this version, and truer to the book. Daniel Craig was a good casting too.I feel that I need to watch the Swedish version again to reacquaint myself.I suppose that the books were simply too good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Great mystery thriller.,"Once again, David Fincher's set up was great. The escalation of the movie was amazing and also the plot is not boring at all.

Do not watch it if you are still reading the next books,"I was disappointed with this movie. I think, at least if you have read the first book, you can't perceive all the demons of all the characters. I had too much expectation with Lizbeth Salander performance, but it wasn't good enough. I haven't see the Sweeden movie yet, I read it is way better.The worst of everything is that I am still reading the book number two. And in one part of the movie they screw me up revealing a thrill of what I am just reading. Not good at all. They mix some things of the next books. I am regretting now to have watched this movie.

only the 2009 original version is the best,"the original version of the girl with the dragon tattoo (2009) was the best movie. Noomi Rapace was and still is the better actress. plus why is it, that the American version of Lisbeth Salanderthe is so dirty and filthy. in the original film she was clean and nice. yes she had tattoos and a Mohawk hair stile and body piercing but she was very clean and intelligent and nice. But, the American version totally made her look like a slut, prostitute. Americans stereotyping people. Even Daniel Craig should have declined this role he is not better than Michael Nyqvist actually, Michael Nyqvist is better than he is. People go get the original 2009 version of the movie on DVD. that is the only one must see version.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Great Hollywood re-make,"Foreign language films are often remade by Hollywood to enable them to be seen by a much wider audience and to cash in on their proven success. Often this involves moving the story to America and the casting of big box office stars but seemingly more often than not results in a poorer film for many reasons, often despite a much bigger budget. For me two notable exceptions to this in recent years have been the vampire masterpiece Let Me In and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Both originally Swedish films, their remakes were still set in Sweden and pretty much copied the original films without them having the need to massively rewrite or change what were already great films. Having also read the book to this particular film I can also state that it does the original story justice and isn't one of those many occasions where the book is so obviously much better than the film.Although I still marginally prefer the original, which offers a little more detail thereby helping the viewer understand the complex plot, this film is slick, stylish and intelligent and Daniel Craig along with some of the over actors give superb performances in what remains a suburb and compelling thriller very much true to its Swedish roots.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"Well-crafted mystery, but Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander is the best reason to see this","I am generally NOT a fan of re-makes, especially one so close in time to the original (2011 vs 2009). But this is such a rich, interesting story that they pull it off quite well. The story remains set and filmed (mostly) in Sweden, each character uses his or her version of a Swedish accent. But it is a more elaborate production and takes the whole story up a notch.In my comments on the 2009 movie I wrote, ""All the characters are good, but I can't say enough about Rapace as Lisbeth. She creates a character as memorable as any. More closely akin to Nikita than anything else."" Now I must echo that for Rooney Mara. Who would have thought, from her role in 'The Social Network'? She deserved the Oscar nomination and it would not been wrong if she had won.Daniel Craig is the investigative reporter, Mikael Blomkvist. Christopher Plummer is Henrik Vanger, who hires him to re-look at the disappearance 40 years earlier of his niece. And Stellan Skarsgård is Martin Vanger. In an interesting casting Robin Wright is Erika Berger .The story follows the same arc but some of the story elements are presented differently, often in more detail. The scenes with Lisbeth and her dastardly guardian are more graphic. In the original Blomkvist has to spend 3 months in jail after his conviction, here it appears he only has to pay a large fine. And there is another key difference I will mention below after ""spoilers.""Overall an excellent movie, and since I saw the 2009 version about 10 months ago, this one was very fresh to me. I hope they make the second and third ones too, but that seems to be in doubt right now.SPOILERS: As in the original Nazi Martin Vanger was the perpetrator of many unsolved killings, and he was responsible for the niece's disappearance, she fled because she was afraid. In the original she was found in Australia. In this version she was found practicing law in London under a different name. After Martin's death in a fiery car crash she was able to reconcile with her family.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Only intermittently thrilling,"I approached this without preconceptions, having neither read the books nor seen the Swedish movie version. This big-budget version has an appropriately Scandinavian feel to it: bleak, wintry and dark. Some of the characters attempt a vaguely Nordic accent; others (including Daniel Craig) wisely do not.The movie gets off to a slow start and goes on far too long. The pace only picks up when Mikael realises he's pursuing a serial killer and recruits Lisbeth to help with his research. The unmasking of the killer is not an enormous surprise, and the killer's 'back story' is out there in the twilight zone with the early life of Hannibal Lecter.Craig is much better cast in this kind of movie than as Pierce Brosnan's substitute. Rooney Mara will be an actress to look out for, although I thought the SM scenes with her lard-ass 'guardian' were superfluous to the central plot and a bit too unpleasant to watch. An interesting movie, but often tedious and only intermittently thrilling.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A review of the Millennium Series,"The Millennium Series is a series of best-selling and award-winning Swedish crime novels, created by Trotskyism Journalism Stieg Larsson, which depicts Mikael Blomkvist, an investigative journalist, and editor of a magazine called Millennium, and a Punk talented young hacker, Lisbeth Salander. The series includes three original books, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played with Fire, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Net, and subsequence books written by David Lagercrantz, including The Girl in the Spider's Web, The Girl Who Takes an Eye for an Eye and the Girl Who Lived Twice. Together they were sold over 100 million copies around the world, making it one of the best-selling book series in history.From my point of view, this book series shows not only outstanding detective thrillers, featuring Bolmkvist's analysis through public materials and Salander's talent hack skills, but it also has a deep discussion of Social Justice from all aspects. The first and most famous one-The Girl with Dragon Tattoo discussed widespread gender-based violence in Sweden, the abuse of powerful industrialists, and so on. In the second and third books, the writers discussed the human-trafficking ring in Sweden and its connection to organized crime in Eastern European countries as well as its link with the intelligent agencies across Europe. It also features how domestic violence and the abuse of power from institutions can turn things even worse. Lisabeth was born to a defected KGB agent and a drunk mother, her father kept abusing her and her mother, but due to her father's sensitive identity, no authorities can do anything to help her and her mother. At last, she fought back and almost killed her father with Molotov Cocktail, but in return, she was also sent to forest care and was transferred from one guardian to another. As a result, even when she turned 18, her life was still under the control of others, and some of them were very sadistic. Thankfully, due to her own efforts as well as efforts from Mikael Blomkvist, she gradually gained her right back. Meanwhile, she and Mikael Blomkvist together looked into a series of unsolved murders which leads to the uncovering of Salander's father-who turned into an organized crime gang leader along with her brother and sister under the protection of intelligent agencies in Sweden.In addition, as a member of the Trotskyism Communist Party of Sweden, Blomkvist also shows his sympathy for all people who were repressed. As an international fighter who had gone to Eritrean to train women partisans in the independence war, he focused his attention on third world countries, gender and sex minorities, the abuse of big companies and authorities, labor rights, and union movements, etc. All of these show that he is not an ordinary detective novel writer.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Fincher Kicked My Cynical Ass,"Last night, I walked into The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo fostering a number of prejudices. I couldn't understand why David Fincher would direct a remake of a bestselling novel. I scoffed at the idea that Americans are afraid of subtitles. I sighed impatiently after realizing that the running time was two hours and forty minutes. I ended up enjoying the Hell out of it.As the opening credits explode on screen, Fincher sets the tone for what is a brutally confident and visually aggressive thriller. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian says, ""Nothing in the movie quite matches the terrific opening sequence,"" which pounds its way into your head through its use of a ""nightmarish, amorphous vision in liquid monochrome."" What transpires next is a rather even-handed introduction to a trilogy based on the characters of Stieg Larsson. Sure the movie has its flaws – like why does Daniel Craig keep his English accent, or the clichés and scenes that almost drag the film down a number of dull meanders – but it is the malevolent and at times perverse intensity that etches its way into your mind long after the film is over.Rooney Mara is Lisbeth Salander, a vulnerable private investigator and hacker who becomes involved with Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), a discredited journalist hired to uncover a murderer in a wealthy feuding family. The pair are brought closer together by the sinister secrets that begin to unravel after Lisbeth cracks a mysterious code.The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo features a number of solid performances, from the conflicted Mara and cardigan-wearing Craig, to the array of memorable characters such as Lisbeth's vile guardian or Mikael's distant wife.Also, following their Oscar-winning collaboration on The Social Network, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross are back with yet another menacing hard-edged score, as violent synthesizers rumble. The film opens with a soaring industrial cover of Immigrant Song by Led Zeppelin (as heard in the popular trailer for the film), with Karen O's voice giving it a distorted exposure during the slick silver montage.Even when it really slows down, the movie never drags, and at least you can get a good look at a sickly world inhabited by cyberpunks, twisted Germans, ferocious degenerates and Daniel Craig in spectacles. A very powerful first move by Fincher, who gives this remake some brutal purpose.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Pretentious, Misogynist, Christophobic, Torture Porn","""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is a series of scenes of sadomasochistic torture. The most graphic scene depicts a large adult male violating a female who has the body of a pubescent girl. There are other, less graphic scenes where males are subject to sadomasochistic torture. There is a series of still photographs of women who have been subjected to sadomasochistic torture. Audience members who are attracted to that activity, or fantasies of it, will very much want to see this film. They will be rewarded by it. The film will inspire some to pursue the opportunity to violate women and girls. The filmmakers will profit from others' pain.A flimsy, utterly vanilla murder plot – a plot out of a C-grade episode of ""Columbo"" – is the excuse for the exploitation scenes. A girl named Harriet disappeared forty years ago from a rich family's private island in Sweden. If you're at all curious as to what happened to Harriet, do yourself a favor and perform a google search of the film's title plus the word ""spoiler."" You'll soon discover how vapid the plot is.The biggest mystery of the film is why all these people ostensibly living in Sweden speak English with variations on Scandinavian accents, accents that roll around unevenly between Helsinki and Vienna. Robin Wright's accent is best. Christopher Plummer's is worst. Daniel Craig doesn't even try (memories of his uneven Polish accent in ""Defiance."")Harriet is being pursued by Daniel Craig, a reporter, and Lisbeth, the eponymous heroine. Lisbeth is strictly a male fantasy who could never exist in real life. She is less real than the blow-up doll Ryan Gosling fell in love with in ""Lars and the Real Girl."" Lisbeth has superhero powers on a computer, with weapons, on a motorcycle, and in international finance, but she is helpless when men attempt to assault her. Make the woman powerful and then violate and humiliate her: a classic motif of misogynist porn. Lisbeth has the body of a pubescent girl, and you get to see every inch of it. For the gentlemen's club crowd, Lisbeth does girl-on-girl action, but, in the end, her job is to make the male lead, and viewer, happy.As part of the film's pretentious overlay, there are lots of interior shots of Swedish furniture and exterior shots of snow. Chair. Snow. Wind. Torture. Lather. Rinse. Repeat.The film is boring. The attempts to create tension are pathetic and hackneyed. A character is alone in an archive at night. Suddenly a door is heard closing. OOOO boogedy boogedy! I'm really scared now! Evidence is pieced together and suddenly one realizes who the antagonist is. And the antagonist is creeping up upon the hero even at that very moment! Be still my heart. A killer talks for a really long time before dispatching the victim, thus potentially giving a rescuer a chance to arrive. Wow, I've never seen THAT done before!There is a completely pointless series of scenes tacked on at the end relating to high finance. So much for narrative tension and drive. Trent Reznor's score is endlessly irritating in its neediness: ""Listen to me! Listen to me! Listen to me! I'm doing something really edgy here!"" I kept thinking of Bernard Herrmann's amazing shower scene music from ""Psycho,"" music that seemed to just be the natural sound that scene would make, music that was a seamless part of the terror. No such moments in ""Tattoo.""What else. Rich people are bad. Nazis are really, really bad. Rich Nazis are really, really, really bad. Fat people are worst of all. The Bible causes people to become serial killers who hate women. Interestingly, boring, pretentious torture porn, apparently, does not cause people to become serial killers who hate women. Every other Swedish home has an extensively equipped torture chamber – you missed that at IKEA, didn't you? Well, the stores ARE really big. Torture is such a popular national pastime in Sweden that you have to wonder how they make time to prepare their famous meatballs, never mind Volvos. Tourists traveling to Sweden must learn to say, ""Don't tase me, Bro,"" in Swedish, and should never, ever drop the soap.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Holds you to the very End!!!!,This should have won a Golden Globe and Academy Award!! The story is mesmorizing and the acting is superb. Brilliant writing that actually resembles the book. I usually am disappointed in the movie after I read such a good book but this is a movie I could watch several times and enjoy it more each time. It would have been easy to overact for the two main characters but they were so real and the supporting actors were equally as good. I am not real big on subtitles but this was worth it.

Incredible: 10,"This is a cold movie. The temperature of the story's location is low, the sets are stark, and the color palette is muted. The only hint of warmth comes in a brief flashback to a simpler, happier time. Nothing like it happens before or since, and due to its significance to the story, it is a very memorable scene. However, nothing like it happens before or after. The film all but comes out and tells you that this little Swedish island has many, many problems. And it's not the only one. Arguably even more important than the story is the female lead character, Lisbeth Salander. Apparently, many other reviewers have said this, but it will never diminish in importance. Rooney Mara delivers one of the best performances I have ever seen. While watching her in the film, I completely forgot Lisbeth was being portrayed by someone. I actually thought she was a person, not a movie character. This is how utterly convincing Mara is, whether she is investigating a murder or getting vengeance for being raped, she is always Salander. And she EVOLVES. This one of the few times in any movie I've seen where it is possible to actually observe a character's arc. When she smiles, you know she has been at least partially transformed. For the better. Her relationship with Mikael Blomkvist (played by the inimitable Daniel Craig) is as important to the story as the the central mystery. Craig and Mara play off each other admirably, whether it be with borderline hostility or sexual attraction. As she is with seemingly everyone, she is incredibly guarded against him at first, keeping a taser in her waistband at their first meeting. However, despite the obvious physical and mental differences between them, they investigate with a dedication and passion that seems like it would be unmatched. This investigation is what drives the unusually involving plot along. A wealthy former industrialist's grandniece was murdered forty years ago,and said man wants the mystery solved before he passes on. He says that Blomkvist will be investigating ""thieves, misers, bullies, the most detestable group of people you will ever meet."" Well, at least he was up front about it. His family meets all four of these criteria, including more than one Nazi and a murderer. Unsurprisingly, no one talks to anyone else. Detestable, indeed. Gradually, Salander and Blomkvist discover layers to the mystery that hook you with ferocious efficiency. Without spoiling anything, the story has one or two major twists that anyone who hasn't read the book or seen the 2009 version will expect. I know I didn't. And the ending is an unexpected gut-punch that WILL make you feel for the characters, as well as finalizing Lisbeth's evolution from a cold, insane person to slightly less of one. David Fincher has stated that if this film is successful, the sequels will be adapted back to back, with Craig and Mara reprising their roles. Please go see this movie so that this might happen. Once you do, you'll want this to happen as badly as I do. It's just that good.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

I wanted to know how this movie is not in the list of top 250 movies? This is a huge disappointment. I hope it will be in the future. In my opinion, the main character of the story, as the name suggests, is Rooney Mara, and Daniel Craig plays a supporting role, unlike my James Bond movie. The cinematography is surprisingly good. The soundtrack helps where it should, though it could have been better used. The mystery of the movie (Harriet) is well solved. Be sure to see and enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Polished looks and a bad story telling.,"This movie -most certainly- should be a joy to watch for those who read the book. But for those who didn't, it does a poor job of reaching out to the viewer and making them feel the atmosphere of the story.The book was covered good enough, the plotting was satisfactory but it certainly didn't drag me, as the story evolved and came to an end.The ending was poorly covered and it felt like skipping tens of pages of a book and reading the end pages. The story told on the screen, went too fast, just as the director was trying to squeeze a tale of hours into just 2.Acting was definitely good.

the true effective and amazing bonding of the perfect director and the perfect story.,"Director; David Fincher's remake really took off with this movie as it depicts, revulsion, excitement and thrill through the director's eyes. it truly unveils, the extent of creativity of the movie by its ability to convey the accurate illustration of its characters.
(2011)'s girl with the dragon tattoo, is truly a work of art as it has amazing character build up where both the main characters MIKAEL BLOMKVIST and LISBETH SALANDER were articulated in such a great way by there corresponding actors. The movie also gave an amazing depiction to the plot of the story as it was told in such a jarring and a realistic manner, every scene is a sublime Segway to what is about to come.
As the movie has profound detail in its present time frame as it does about its backstories, it feels like reality coming to life.

Overall acting was good, i thought Mara did a good job as Sahlander although Naomi Rapace was excellent and she will always be Sahlander.I know some complains at the disturbing scenes in the movie and i feel they are even more disturbing in the Swedish version, but a movie that moves you in any sort of way, whether its disturbing, funny, romantic or in an angry way i think is reaching its goal.

A Brutal and Riveting Crime-Mystery-Thriller,"One of the things that kept me away from this movie for so long was how graphic I had heard it was. But I have become prone to gory and graphic films over the years so what better time to watch it than a month before David Fincher's new film, Gone Girl is released. I really like all of Fincher's movies and I think The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is among his best. All of his movies have a dark tone and look to them. This is no exception. He sets this beautifully creepy world perfectly and puts his actors in the right position to be successful. I haven't seen the original trilogy so I'm unable to compare for now, but I can say that Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig are perfect for these two roles.It's hard to watch a movie with Daniel Craig and not automatically think James Bond, and have him not be the most intimidating character on screen. Mara is downright frightening but also charismatic as Lisbeth, the troubled young woman who struggles to find her way in life. But she's good at one thing, investigating. It's her job to help Craig in finding out what truly happened to Harriet, the granddaughter of Henrik, the man who hired them. As you do with most mysteries, you begin to suspect every suspiciously acting character shown. I have to say it was pretty hard to identify just who was involved. Fincher did a great job with storytelling here, and making us second guess ourselves several times.When Mara and Craig do finally team up about an hour in, the film takes itself to a new level and the intensity amps up. I did find it strange that Mara didn't think twice about working with Craig, especially after illegally investigating him. One of the most incredibly acted scenes was with Skarsgard and Craig in the basement cellar. The back and forth is fascinating and the way Skarsgard thinks exactly what he's describing is normal is astounding. But even then Fincher keeps twisting the story. Which is one of the problems I had with the film, it seemed like there were 3 or 4 different endings but it kept going. And the actual final scene wasn't as satisfying as I had hoped considering it's unlikely they will film the two sequels.This is without a doubt one of the better crime-drama-mystery-thrillers I have seen. The intensity throughout kept me on the edge of my seat and I didn't know what to expect next. It's this type of directing I am looking for in next month's Gone Girl. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is one of the best thrillers in recent memory and is up there with Fight Club, Se7en, and Zodiac as his best overall film.+Mara's performance was captivating+Intense and riveting+Dark tone is beautifully captured+Craig is not a bad***+Unpredictable-Last scene not satisfying9.0/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

An inferior and unnecessary remake,"This US remake is simply inferior in every way compared to its Swedish predecessor. I have viewed both the Swedish abridged movie version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and in its original form as Millennium the TV series numerous times. I wont say the original Swedish adaptations are perfect by any means, but many of the elements and small, seemingly insignificant moments from the original are either missing or have been diluted for Western audiences.First of all, Rooney Mara is no Noomi Rapace. Everything about her, from her weird hairstyle and shaved off eyebrows, to her distracting attempt at a Swedish accent, and her cold lifeless portrayal of Lisbeth Salander in general are a detriment to the film. She never garnered the empathy and interest in Lisbeth that Noomi did for me. And the chemistry that Nyquist and Rapace created together, both as colleagues and lovers, is entirely missing. Craig is OK as Blomqwist, he is not an emotional actor and can come off as cold and indifferent. Also why does he speak in his normal accent yet Mara puts on a Swedish accent? I found this very distracting. Fincher is a gifted visual director, but his usual flair is missing here, and really anyone could have directed this adaptation.Its not a bad movie, just an unnecessary and inferior remake that never reaches the heights of its Swedish predecessor. For the definitive and best version, view the original Millennium TV series.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Fincher Scores Again,"I could tell, even before I saw it, that it was going to be a great movie, and I was not disappointed.To me, David Fincher is one the best director on the planet, and it was great to see that he, yet again, has delivered an amazing movie.The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, tells the story of Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), who is in the midst of a court case with powerful business man, Hans Wennerstrom. Shortly after Mikael is contacted by Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), a Swedish industrialist, who offers him a job in searching for a killer from over 50 years prior. Soon after acquiring this job, Mikael hires Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) to do research for the murder and together they discover that there is way more to the crime than meets the eye.Of the movies from the Oscar season, none of them kept me as drawn in as Girl With the Dragon Tattoo did. The acting, the story, the score and the setting were all top notch.Daniel Craig as Mikael Blomkvist was done well. I've never seen Craig as a great James Bond, but playing an older man with evident vulnerabilities was much better suited for him. Rooney Mara, who was practically a nobody before this movie, turned up a performance that, to me, was worthy of the Oscar. I was a bigger of Rooney as Lisbeth Salander than Noomi Rapace (who was great in her own right, however). Rooney was great at portraying the victim in the earlier parts of the movie, and then made an amazing turnaround as an aggressive, take-charge woman. The rest of the cast was great, despite having less important roles, with an obvious stand-out being Stellan Skarsgard.One thing that people may overlook when watching a movie is how much the score can improve a scene. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, just coming off Fincher's Social Network, turn in another score that fits with the movie and adds to scenes. The music in the final scene is absolutely perfect.One thing Fincher has always been able to do in his movies is add his own charming touch and sense of humour to a extremely dark atmosphere. In GWTDT, he succeeds in this again, showing comedic moments in one of the darkest movies in recent memory.It may be biased on my part, since I'm such a big fan of almost everyone involved in this movie, but it is truly a phenomenal film. Specific scenes may be to graphic to handle, and the overall feel of the film may be too grim for some, but it's one of the best serial killer movies ever made.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
I come from the land of the ice and snow!,"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is certainly one of the more depressing films of the year, but also one of the most enthralling, hard to turn away from films of the year. It follows Mikael Blomkvist (Craig), a journalist who has just lost everything, and Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a researcher/computer hacker whose life has been nothing but hardship and misunderstanding since her adolescent years. The two converge on a case surrounding one of the more prominent and dirty families in all of Sweden, the Vangers.Henrik Vanger (Plummer) hires Mikael to investigate the disappearance of his niece. He encounters many problems, the biggest being the disappearance happened 40 years ago. When his research starts getting interesting and more dangerous, he calls upon Lisbeth, who did the background check on Mikael for the Vangers. Together the two try to solve the case, digging up hidden truths, dirty secrets, and encountering some detestable characters along the way. They don't know if they're getting close or farther from the truth, but as the heat turns up, it seems like the answer is rapidly approaching, or is it their impending demise?What stands out most about this film from the original Swedish version of a few years ago is the mood. Yes, both films cover some disturbing material, but the original version looks like it was filmed in the real world. Fincher, however, creates an entirely different world. It looks, feels, and almost smells dirty. There is hardly a white light found in the film. Even the snow is turned grey by the overcast skies. You get the feeling that there is no hope for these characters.There is really only one area where the film lacks. Pacing. There is so much information to translate to the audience. It's the job of the editor and the writer to make sure that the audience doesn't skip a beat. There is montage after montage, intercuts, and Swedish writing thrown about that it's hard to keep track of what exactly a character is doing. We get the gist of it all, but there were moments when I was lagging behind just enough to notice.Other than that I thought the film was a fine adaptation for American audiences. I wasn't sure how the sexual violence would be handled, but Fincher doesn't hold back, much like the Swedish film. Is it important that we see this violence? I hate to say it but yes. We need to like Lisbeth so much that we completely disregard her outward appearance and see her as a survivor. She's extremely talented and fearless. Mara brings Lisbeth to life much like Noomi Rapace brought her to life, only Mara is a letter more brazen and less moody than Noomi, but both are effective with what they do. Craig too gives a solid performance. I was worried that they would try to toughen his character up (seeing as Craig is currently James Bond), but they didn't. They make him likable only because he seems normal and one who stands up for what he believes in.It's a slimy, complex, fast-moving thriller that is sure to turn some heads at times but in the end you'll be holding your breath and hoping for the best. You might go into the movie clean, but you'll come out dirty.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Almost as good as the books itself and much darker than the Swedish film versions + David fincher delivers once again,Easily the best performance of Daniel Craig to date. As he also looks a little Nordic he easily fits in with the surrounding. The movie is dark and almost as crazy as the books. as we do see a new actress play as Lisbeth Salander she delivers an award winning performance. Even though it is around 2 and a half hours it does not feel that long as most of the supporting cast is also acted very brilliantly. The movie goes very well with the winter setting of snowy Sweden. The best parts of the movie other than the performance of Rooney Mara is the cinematography of the movie and a nice soundtrack to accompany it is. Overall a well done job I enjoyed it,7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Excellent, dark mystery","This movie is fantastic from start to finish. It's full of fascinating and very well-played characters. It's dark (really dark), it's moody, it grabs your attention and never lets you go. The pace of plot development is spot on.I thought both Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara were excellent (Mara that little bit more excellent than Craig!). They also weave in a really subtle love story.I find it hard to think of much to criticise, but being a mystery story it probably needed a few more plot twists and a few more interesting minor characters to justify a 10 out of 10!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
faithful adaptation with a transgressive touch,"It's dark and intriguing, the English-language version of the best-selling Stieg Larsson novel is memorable as its Swedish counterpart that was released two years ago. Somehow very disturbing, mesmerizing, with the tone beginning in the opening credits, which are a wonder to behold, and continuing up to the last frame, the story is also enhanced by an excellent soundtrack. Though Daniel Craig's Mikael is interesting, it's the character of Lisbeth which fascinates the most and affects the audience. Mara infuses her character with gloom and rage. This is certainly more than another mystery but a story of revenge, mental issues and ghastly secrets.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Fantastic Mysterious Tension filled Movie!,"I don't give very many 10's but this movie deserves it. I watched both versions the Swedish and the Hollywood remake back to back. Both are excellent! Alfred Hitchcock couldn't have made a better movie. Great acting, a plot that made total sense and kept me wondering where things were going, and tension that had me sitting up at the edge of my seat. Don't watch this movie if you have an aversion to brutal violence. Some scenes are very very graphic. Hollywood is into remakes these days while great stories like this are being made into movies in foreign countries. There are thousand's and thousand's of other untold great stories out there but Hollywood is only interested in reproductions catering to young audiences that have never seen the original. Add new up and coming stars and Jazz the old movie up a bit and yes they probably make money, but in the end they have soiled a work of art. No one has chosen to re-write ""War and Peace"" or a Tail of Two Cites"" no one is repainting the ""Mona Lisa"" so why is Hollywood so eager to redo old movies that are works of art.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"The rare Hollywood remake that's even better than the Swedish original, this is a first-rate edge-of-your-seat thriller that's exceedingly gripping from start to finish","Why the venerable David Fincher would attempt a Hollywood remake of the first-rate Swedish thriller 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' may seem perplexing at first, but just wait till you see what Fincher has brought to his adaptation of the popular Stieg Larsson pulp novel. Indeed, though Niels Arden Oplev's film may have been the first out of the gate, it is Fincher's that proves to be the superior one, for the auteur's return to twisted serial-killer territory is an even more heart- stopping, gripping and altogether exhilarating edge-of-your-seat movie than its predecessor.As his work with 'Se7en' and 'Zodiac' will attest, Fincher is no stranger to dark, disturbing material. 'Tattoo' is no different; here is a bleak and brutal story of crime and punishment that features scenes of sadistic rape, twisted torture, and grotesque religiously-inclined murders. It is a tale of uncompromising savagery, and Fincher seems right at home, combining the lurid elements inherent within Larsson's tale with the sharp procedural rigour of his earlier 'Zodiac'.Following an edgy and utterly mesmerising title sequence set to Trent Reznor's rip of Led Zeppelin's 'The Immigrant Song', the remake opens with Stockholm-based magazine journalist Mikael Bolmkvist (Daniel Craig) losing a high-profile libel suit filed by corrupt businessman Hans-Erik Wennerstrom (Ulf Friberg). Facing bankruptcy and the reputational ruin of the magazine Millennium he co-publishes with his married on-again/ off-again lover Erika Berger (Robin Wright), Mikael accepts an unusual offer from industrial magnate Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) to investigate the unsolved murder of his beloved niece Harriet 40 years ago.Henrik is convinced that Harriet's disappearance was an act of murder by a member of his sprawling family, which he describes as a collection of ""thieves, misers, bullies, and basically the most detestable collection of people that you will ever meet"". Enticed by Vanger's reward of a hefty paycheck and payback against Wennerstrom down the road, Mikael moves into a cottage on Henrik's vast estate and meets with his various family members under the guise of being tasked with writing their family biography.Whereas the Swedish original wasted little time bringing together Mikael and the computer punk-goth genius Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), Hollywood veteran screenwriter Steven Zaillian keeps them apart for pretty much the first half of the movie. The parallel narratives allow us to delve deeper into the Millennnium trilogy's most compelling character, whose startling physical appearance is simply an extension of her troubled inner persona. That personality is amply expressed through two of the film's most unsettling scenes- the first, a brutal rape by her legally assigned guardian Bjurman (Yorick van Wageningen); and the second, her coolly calculated act of revenge against Bjurman. If those scenes left you squirming the first time round, you may want to cover your eyes here, for Fincher stages them unflinchingly for maximum shock value.Perhaps even more than Oplev managed to, Fincher evokes empathy from his audience for Lisbeth. It is no easy task- how does one identify with a teenage girl who lives on Happy Meals and caffeine and wears a T-shirt that reads ""F**k You, You F**king F**k""? But beyond her tough-girl hard- as-nails exterior, Fincher guides Mara to tone down her character's feral nature and draw out Lisbeth's vulnerabilities. There is a fragility to Mara's spellbinding portrayal of Lisbeth that is missing from Noomi Rapace's in the original, so even though Mara doesn't succeed in topping Rapace's star-making turn, she too disappears just as convincingly into the role.Mara also shares great rapport with her co-star Craig, and though both hold their own on their own, the film truly sizzles after the latter's Mikael tracks her down to be his research assistant. Despite the sombreness of the material, Zaillian injects some brief moments of levity through Mikael and Lisbeth's wry chemistry, bouncing theories off each other like offbeat detectives while sifting through Biblical clues and old photographs. Fincher has been infamous for being extremely meticulous in his filmmaking, and that discipline pays off with a crystal clarity he brings to the investigative procedural. More so than the original, there is both paceyness and coherence to the storytelling- with due credit to Zaillian for adroitly paring the excesses of the novel into a lean and efficient cinematic adaptation.Despite the almost two-and-a-half-hour duration, you'll find yourself hooked the entire time, unable to pull yourself away from the arrestingly intense atmosphere permeating the whole movie. Assembling once again his 'Social Network' team- made up of composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth, as well as editors Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall- Fincher uses their considerable talents to construct a sense of forebodingness with a haunting score and evocative cinematography of the frosty Scandinavian landscape.If there is one quibble, it is that the actors' accents (English with a Swedish inflection) don't always ring true- especially Craig, who thankfully drops his sometimes indecipherable Swedish intonation early on in the film in favour for a straight-out British one. And yes, it is but a minor flaw in an otherwise pitch-perfect thriller, where everything- from atmosphere to storytelling to casting to characterisation- is done to a T and coheres so flawlessly to create a taut, riveting and adrenaline-pumping movie experience. It's not often we say this- but even if you've read the books, and seen the Swedish original, this superior first-rate Hollywood adaptation is a must-see.www.moviexclusive.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Pointless  arguments over remakes,"Could we stop these endless debates about remakes? This latest version is not a remake, it is another interpretation of a book. Any work of art (high or low) can be re-interpreted, and there is no reason why a talented director like Fincher shouldn't present us with his version. (We don't whine about new interpretations of Shakespeare.) There are two criteria for evaluating whether a remake is justified: financial and artistic. I doubt the producers will be disappointed if it isn't a blockbuster - they could have avoided the R classification - and artistically, it seems perfectly valid: the direction, cinematography, soundtrack are superior, and the performances are at least as good as the original.Again, it is pointless to try do compare Rapace and Mara: each offers a powerful perspective on the character. Craig, has been rightly praised, but for those who felt him subdued or 'blown away' by Mara - please recognise that acting is an ensemble activity - he has been praised by Mara for his generosity - and his role was not only that of a somewhat insecure journalist, on the skids, but also a complementary foil to Mara's. The role and the interests of the film required him to tone down the charisma and 'act'.All in all, an invigorating and stimulating new take on the book.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Very Interesting,"Hey everybody! Thank you so much for joining me again for another movie review. I am going to be reviewing the mystery thriller, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. David Fincher, the director of such works as Fight Club and Seven, was nominated for two Oscars for the films The Curios Case Of Benjamin Button and The Social Network. I'm a big fan of David Fincher's work. I love how he combines great stories with good cinematography. Sometimes the cinematography takes a back seat in his films and you get so involved in the story that its such an enjoyable experience. I have definitely taken notes for some of my future movies to come. Some cool things to look for in Fincher's films is how he uses low key lighting with green or blue tinted color temperature. The other thing I liked-- and I used in my short film--I adopted his idea of often featuring several single frames that flash on the screen in the middle of a scene. You know, when I watched the film I enjoyed it. I feel like the movie did the novel justice, but the only problem I really had with it was that it took too long to get to the point where you start to see the relationships between the characters develop and how they react with each other as the story unfolds. Like me, you might loose the interest of your audience but, then again, I understand the concept of building suspense, so its a love hate relationship with that aspect. The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is a 2011 American mystery thriller based on the Swedish novel by Steig Larson. The film stars Daniel Craig and Rooney Marie and tells the story of journalist Mikael Blomkvist's investigation to find out what happened to a woman from a wealthy family that's been missing for over forty years. Persoanlly, I love the story and even throughout the movie the director was able to build suspense and get you thinking or trying to figure out for yourself who was the culprit. Thats something I truly love about filmmaking when your able to involve your audience without really involving them. That is a technique I'm trying to figure out myself. What really impressed me about the film was how long the process took for it to finally go into production. Sony Pictures began development of the film in 2009. It took some time for the company to obtain the rights to the novel. The film's script took over six months to write which included analyzing the novel, but with a budget of 90 million they were off to Norway and Switzerland to shoot for seven months. Overall I enjoyed the dark, grim tone of the film, but the ending left me either wanting more or confused. It was brutal and entertaining. I think we get to see a new side of David Fincher and I'm interested to see what's next. I give it 9 out of 10 movie reels. Join me again for another addition of film reviews from a filmmaker....",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"A complex, dark mystery/thriller that will keep you guessing till the end","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo begins with disgraced journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) who is battling a massive libel case which has the potential to destroy both Blomkvist and his family. Things take a turn for Blomkvist when wealthy industrialist Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) offers to get the case against Blomkvist dropped if he can solve the 40 year old mystery surrounding his niece's disappearance. With the help of investigator and expert computer hacker Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), they both try to get to the bottom of what has happened to Vanger's niece.I really like films that keep you guessing and this film did precisely that. Although it is a rather slow film, it was always interesting. Every single segment in the film was like another piece being added to the jigsaw puzzle. Blomkvist's investigation isn't made any easier by the fact that Vanger's family don't really speak to each other after the little girl's disappearance and therefore he finds that he has to conduct separate investigations with each family member.This is initially structured as 2 separate story arcs; Blomkvist is investigating the disappearance of Vanger's niece whilst Salander is investigating Blomkvist, but she also has her own problems with her sleazy guardian which leads Salander to investigate him as well. Once she has completed her investigation on her guardian (I won't reveal plot points here, so you'll just need to watch the film), Salander is invited to assist Blomkvist in solving the missing girl's disappearance. She, in effect, becomes Blomkvist's research assistant.As well as the film being constantly engaging and constantly leaving you in suspense, I also found the character of Salander to be fascinating; her dark and multi layered complexity made her very interesting. I also thought that Rooney Mara was excellent in her portrayal of Salander and managed to balance her emotions really well; at time she was rather meek and quiet, but there were also times when she showed that she wasn't a woman to be reckoned with. Daniel Craig was also very good in the lead role and the rest of the principal cast all did an OK job, but for me it was Rooney Mara that stole the show. Fincher's direction was also spot on.If you are a fan of mystery films and films that keep you guessing, then TGWTDT will be right up your street. It is a slow burning film so it will require patience, but the pay off makes it worthwhile.SIDE NOTE; I haven't seen the Swedish version yet, but having enjoyed this version I will be sure to check it out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Movie is phenomenal!,"Some would say that there are some quite dramatic scenes portraying anal rape and oral sex, but its the role thats important as is the provocative state of the female hacker with a dragon tattoo. Whats with the girl hackers that's so appealing to see in the movies? They aren't the weaker sex in any way, neither are here as an informant of the digital age. Long story short, Craig is sent to investigate a long ago missing of a young woman belonging to a rich Sweden family. He gets help from an eccentric girl with a tattoo of a black dragon on her back. She is a master hacker, estranged and weird in terms of regular world. She doesn't fit in, but she is so skillful in computers and investigations. Sweden family keeps this dark secret hidden by all means, except one member thats keen to find out the truth. I would like to point out this masterful and very realistic acting of Rooney Mara, that has thrown aside the whole effect of ancient ""Hackers"", has earned her a well deserved Oscar.

The movie forces me to need to read the book to iron-out what is going on.,"I did not read the book. I don't necessarily want to read the book, but the movie is very slick to look at which, I like very much. I prefer not to have to go back and research any book that a movie is based-on in order to follow the details I think are missing in the movie. That said, the original Swedish version of this story is much easier to follow than in this American version. The intensity is lacking in the American version and I was not as captivated by Rooney Mara as Noomi Rapace, who is far more compelling on screen than Rooney Mara in this role. Craig was miscast here, and I like him as an actor dashing across a roof like a scalded cat, but not here portraying an editor. Plummer is perfect, as usual. Without resorting to comparing the book to the movie, which is inappropriate I think, this American movie version is simply bland by comparison. I was spellbound and hypnotized by the Swedish version, but unfortunately, just mildly drawn to the plot and characters which in my opinion were far too restrained in the drama they brought to the performance, no doubt designed for overly sensitive American viewers. It would help also if the dialog were easier to hear. What's up with all the whispering? I'll just have to rent the video and play it with subtitles on to discover what is being said. Don't get me wrong - the movie is very watchable as a kind of long music video. I intend to watch this movie several times to see if my negative impressions last over the long run. As movies go, without comparing them to the books they are based on which is unfair, I say see this movie and then see the Swedish versions and decide for yourself.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Woeful,"Having just seen the film I am at a loss as to why so many critics have given it a positive review.I hated the product placement........Rooney Mara was way out of her depth.............the script buried the story with a who's-who of the family........it also included some of the original book's sub-plots (which the Swedish version quite rightly left out)...I thought the 'jokey' chat between Lisbeth and Mikael laboured............the title sequence would have been better attached to an 'Alien 5'...I could go on..as for the changed end, actually I missed it as I walked out while Lisbeth and Mikael were following someones computer activity....another attempt at humour (Amazon,Solitaire) (I have seen the original (Extended Version) and can honestly say that it is far better.)PS 04/01/2012 Watched the original again tonight....No contest :-)",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The Uncomfortablea movie review of 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo',"""Damaged people are dangerous. They know they can survive."" ― Josephine Hart,(found quote at ""Just Under the Surface"" - wordpress blog)This quote is awesome. ...It is Lisbeth Salander.She is damaged, as a result of being a tortured and victimized girl. Out of the simple necessity for survival, she becomes strong and seemingly fearless, with her walls up high and heavily guarded.She is vulnerable, though much of it she keeps under lock and key.She is human, and although projects a 'badass' image, we see in her fear, though it is masked, and shoved to the side by anger and her vengeance for those who commit hate crimes towards women. She is a crusader, a warrior, a vigilante. (I want to hug this girl... but then again, I'm kind of afraid of her. She'd kick my a@# in a heart beat.)Rooney Mara encompasses this character fully. I never once saw an actress on-screen portraying a character. I saw Lisbeth.Simply stated, David Fincher's The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is a hard movie to watch. It is ugly, and shows the ugly side of what our species is capable of (hate, rape, murder, lies, and manipulation). Now, I did not enjoy seeing these horrid/awful themes present themselves. To be honest, watching it totally gave me the cringe factor and I was not immune to the sick feeling at the pit of my stomach. I did, however, like the movie due to the fact that it was willing to talk about the ugly things that go on in life. Most people go on ignoring/act unaware or are, in fact, truly unaware that bad things like these happen. I felt that this book/movie was trying to say, ""hey, don't ignore me this stuff is real. It does/can happen."" I appreciated the fact that this story was able to talk about uncomfortable issues, that are so often swept under the rug. To bring awareness and make changes in this world and society, we have to address the ""uncomfortable.""""The Uncomfortable""18% of the women in Sweden have at one time been threatened by a man.46% of the women in Sweden have been subjected to violence by a man.13% of the women in Sweden have been subjected to aggravated sexual assault outside of a sexual relationship.92% of women in Sweden who have been subjected to sexual assault have not reported the most recent violent incident to the police.-Statistics found before each section in Larsson's book, TGWTDT.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"505th Review: Great plot, solid filming, but above all, an outstanding female role","TGWTDT is a great remake of a very hard to beat Swedish film - and they do pull it off. Cannot recommend the Swedish original highly enough - simply stunning - and scary. But this is faithful to the spirit and place of the original and it is mesmerizing. It is in places an uncomfortable watch, but the tale of the journalist (Daniel Craig) who is hired to solve a family mystery and restore his reputation is spellbinding.But more than that is the outstanding writing, characterization, and above all acting by Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander, who is a wonderfully complex and well-drawn character than easily outshines Daniel Craig and Stellan Skarsgård with a knockout performance. Above all this is a female character, not some male ideal, she is vulnerable and broken, but also tough as nails and unbreakable, smart, frighteningly independent, yet searching to validate her choices, a mass of contradictions and dichotomies of the sort that actresses deserve but rarely get.It may be a gift of a role, but what Rooney does with it is a gift for us - simply the best performance by an actress, in my opinion, this year, and the best since Jennifer Lawrence in Winter's Bone.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo-KICKS A$$!,"I didn't get a chance to see this movie at the theater last year, so I did what most people do and wait until it came out on DVD. This film caught my interest right from the start, the acting was incredible, especially the performance by Rooney Mara. I had never heard of her until I saw her at this year's Oscar's, I think she or the film was up for an Academy Award. I heard of Stieg Larson, who wrote the book, but I heard his books skip around and are very long. So I decided to see the movie first. This was such a great film, U have an outcast, who is very intelligent who knows everything about computers, but has a very unusual style. She catches the eye of Daniel Craig, who is working a case and wants her help in case that goes back years. A case involving the brutal killings of women spanning years. The person responsible is a little predictable, but that's type casting and the only flaw I saw with the movie. I have to say in some of the scenes are disturbing, and didn't add much to the movie, even though the guy who was in charge of her finances deserved what he got. I'm no prude, but there are a few sexual scenes that didn't add much to the movie, Thank GOD they were quick. This movie has everything suspense, excitement to the end, and who done it , that to some the killer was predictable. In the end Mara and Craig make a great team and even though the killer went free for many year, justice does get served to him the end in this terrific thriller. THX, Kris L.

"Well directed and performed, but still unnecessary remake","I postponed watching this movie as I had seen the Swedish version a couple of years ago which I enjoyed a lot. So I knew the basic story- line and did not want to watch a movie due to artistic comparison purposes. Yesterday, when I realized that I did not remember too many scenes, I decided to see what the US version could provide.First I recognized that many scenes were the same or very similar - the director and screenwriter were obviously eager to maintain the Swedish atmosphere, and they succeeded in that (well, most filming in Sweden and Norway was of big help). And introduction of European, incl. Swedish actors was a wise move as well; all the leading ladies and men are at least good, if not great (beginning with Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara). Thanks to strong book behind, the characters are elaborated, scenes and twists are logical; David Fincher's talent and skills let capture the mood and tensions through mystery aura.Nevertheless, the US remake was ready about 2 years after the original Swedish version...

A Very Well Adapted Film,"'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' is a very well adapted film from Stieg Larsson's first book in the trilogy. Having read the book and viewed the Swedish original film released in only in 2009, I did not have great expectations.David Fincher has worked very hard on this picture, the direction is very well done. The script works a lot better than the original film, it takes the time to explain a bit of the back stories of Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist which helped people understand aspects of both the characters and the plot.The plot itself was explained in a style which stayed very true to the novel, but also managed to explain everything so people would not get confused by certain aspects of the story.The acting is excellent, Rooney Mara performs very well and is almost as good as Noomi Rapace. Daniel Craig was perfect for the character he played and has shown he can play more diverse roles. Stellan Skarsgard's character is very interesting and his acting is very well done.Fincher had Trent Reznor (who also did the soundtrack for 'The Social Network') and Atticus Ross do the soundtrack for this film which had a great impact in some parts of the picture.Overall, the film is very good. It's not the best film Fincher has ever made but it does stay true to the original book and has adapted very well. For people who have not read the book I would thoroughly recommend you do so and then watch this film. If you do not like extreme violence and adult themes then this film is not for you, as shown by the film's 18 rating.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011),"As a film, THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO succeeds. An an adaptation, it is frustrating. As a remake, it is pointless.Fincher's film does many things very, very well. The characters are extremely well-cast - Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara both impressively fit the roles of Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander in both attitude and physicality, much more so than their Swedish counterparts; the production design is stunning - the bigger budget pays off as the settings and atmosphere feel much colder and moodier in the snowy and eerie town of Hedestad; and the pacing, after things are rapidly established, flows smoothly with a careful balance of tension, patience, and story development. The film is a finely-crafted thriller that is carried by the performances of its two leads, both of whom showcase great chemistry with one another and admirably so in the depths of a dark, disturbing, and mysterious world.As a remake a mere two years after the original, however, this film had to have been beyond great in order to warrant its existence, and quite frankly, it is not. Every character not only speaks English but does so each with varying accents, despite being set in Sweden, and although viewers are expected to suspend their disbelief, it's tough to do so given the inconsistencies in seeing English news channels with Swedish words, or fully Swedish newspaper articles found through an English-based Google search. How Fincher could have solved this problem is an enigma within itself, therefore confirming that this adaptation was never necessary. Add to that a horrific and awfully out-of-place opening sequence in addition to an obnoxious and unremarkable score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross and you have a really good film that is oddly enough a disappointment.For the record, like its Swedish counterpart, TATTOO fails to fully encompass the scale of Stieg Larsson's novel, which is somewhat forgivable given its various restrictions, but likewise, the brutality was not brutal enough, the characterizations were not fully realized, and the impact of it all failed to achieve both a climax that should have been more powerful and a relief for the characters and the audience that should have likened a gigantic breath of fresh air.With that said, TATTOO is still nevertheless a very solid film from a talented and experienced team. Pic is recommended, but depending on where the viewer is coming from, it will be a widely assorted experience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Keep track of names to know who did what to who and when,"...or you'll get lost as to what is being investigated in such great detail in a 40 year old missing?/murdered? person who done it case.Didn't read the books but it did remind me of a really good Agatha Christie novel I used to read back in the late '70's in high school except without the sadistic torture and provocative sex scenes.You'll appreciate the dark, cold and cozy ambiance of the entire movie that gets you to want to curl up in a warm bed with a hot toddy to read the very great mystery novel you're now watching as the movie unfolds to get you to focus on every character's quirky behaviors as a means of finding out who done it.Pay attention to the sidetrack hacking shenanigans presented as a clever way of getting back at someone through their bank account. Pay attention! It's really cool how it's done!This movie also has that sophisticated European foreign film feel that's so unlike the pacing of American movies. I kept asking is this what it's like in Sweden? Geez! Their welfare system really sucks as well. You'll see what I mean.This movie DOES take you to an alternate unsettling world of daily dysfunctional and abusive family life in another country with a history dealing with its own serial killer who's never been found for 40 years.I'ld have to say without a doubt Rooney Mara's performance is on line with Batman's Heath Ledger's ""Joker"" in the way they completely and totally become another person never seen before but is made to look quite real and unsettling. They both out do Brando and Dean in this respect. It's fascinating to watch an actor go that deep into a character with such realism.

My Movie of 2011,"It will be nearly impossible for me to give an unbiased, objective review of this film without bringing any context or personal mumbo jumbo into it. So I suppose it's better that I not even try, and just talk about this as I see fit.I'll first start out by saying I'm a fanatic of the series of books to which this is based on, and a modest fan of the Swedish film adaptations of those books. They weren't perfect, but I wouldn't call any of them letdowns - not by a long shot. Naturally though, skepticism arose when the American adaptation (then thought of as a ""remake"") was announced. To me that skepticism was not only called for, it was nearly essential. I felt as if it could go two ways: it could be a ""Hollywood"" over simplification of the source material, which would obviously include shameless censoring of the source's graphic sexual violence (necessity be damned); or it could be a simple carbon copy of the original film (not unlike another American adaptation of a Swedish novel/film, Let Me In).Luckily, David Fincher's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is neither of those. The film is not only a more faithful adaptation of the novel, but it also might be even more brutal and, for some, traumatizing than the Swedish original.The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is the story of Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist whose reputation had been squandered by a libel suit, who is hired to solve a 40+ year-old mystery with the aid of the title character, the asocial Lisbeth Salander. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, as a novel, is of a story and style that is unmistakeably Swedish; from the pacing, to the seemingly endless cramming-in of detail, to Sweden's government system working its own way into the plot progression, Sweden is as essential to the novel as any character, plot progression, theme, what have you. It would be a crime to Americanize the story, in both setting and style. Fincher and screenwriter Steven Zaillian made the correct decision of keeping the setting of Sweden and simply having the characters' language masked by English. For some this can be confusing, as the Swedish guardianship system that Lisbeth Salander is under is never fully explained in the film as it is in the books; however if you pay attention, and just go with it, I think you'll get the hang of it just fine.Speaking of Salander, Rooney Mara is exceptional in the role. She shows a side of vulnerability and fear that is locked away in Lisbeth, more so, I think, than Noomi Rapace did nearly three years ago. As far as the other, less noted protagonist of the film Mikael Blomkvist, the casting of Daniel Craig was yet another source of skepticism for me; I simply couldn't think of him being able to pull off Blomkvist in his more sensitive and vulnerable moments. However, Craig shines as brightly as Mara, and the two sport a chemistry equal to that of the leading man and woman in the Swedish film.Even at a length exceeding two and a half hours, I couldn't find myself bored with this film once. Humorous dialogue exchanges are perfectly timed to give us a break from the tension when needed, and those moments never feel tacked on. This film successfully brings me back into the world of the Millennium trilogy in a way that not even the Swedish film could; though I feel that to still be excellent, Fincher's adaptation has more breathing room, and I feel as if I'm seeing this bleak universe unfold before my eyes. I love this film, and ultimately the book series, for the same reasons that I love shows like Twin Peaks or Breaking Bad; they're dark, ominous, kinda messed up, but at the same time, enthralling and ridiculously entertaining. It is, without a doubt, one of the most exhilarating viewing experiences I've had this year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Left me wanting more!,"David Fincher is one of my favorite directors so I was very excited to see this automatically, and when I did I was taking away by how well this was made all the way from the acting, music, scenery, visual effects, story was simply amazing. What Rooney Mara's character had to go thru in the movie was hard to see sometimes but if you like that kind of intensity you will not be disappointed, Daniel Craig nailed it in his performance. Reminds me of Seven and how it kept you at the edge of your seat with memorable scenes and pure strength on the deliver of everything. The dark tone of the film is too much for some , but you must understand the mystery of this film simply asks for it, the wonder of whats going to happen next, who did what, to whom and when, the only gripe I have is the ending because I wanted more of what is surely to come. Worth the price of admission and I hope there will be some Oscars given away for this amazing film. Loved it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Short review based on first impression.,"Let me preface this by saying that I haven't yet read the books or seen the original Swedish films. I will have a full review of this version as it compares to the original films soon.David Fincher (Fight Club, The Social Network) put together a tight and suspenseful film. I thought the acting was great, specifically from Rooney Mara who plays ""the girl"". She is phenomenal and one of the sexiest characters I've seen on screen this year. Daniel Craig was good, but didn't blow me away. He was still James Bond, but now with reading glasses. The pacing and script were wonderful, but I thought Fincher foreshadowed the ending and also felt that they should have re-arranged the conclusions a bit. There were a few story lines that came to a close at different times.....so when one ended you still had a couple more to get through. Unfortunately the first story line that comes to a close is the most intense one so the remaining time is kind of ""meh"" to the viewer since they invested so much emotion in the first storyline. Hope that makes sense. It was a great movie, but if you've seen the originals you may want to wait until this one goes to DVD/br. Full review to come.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Very good movie with great acting. Mara is fantastic. I didn't think it was as good as original. I say B.,"""I want you to help me catch a killer of women."" Disgraced journalist Mikael Blomqvist (Craig) is asked by a man named Henrik Vanger (Plummer) to find his nieces killer who committed the crime 40 years ago. He receives help from the eccentric Lisbeth Salander (Mara) who has her own motives. I had contradicting feelings going into this one. I really loved the original (I haven't read any of the books though) but I was worried about how this one would be but was very excited to see it. I though the casting was perfect but the original Lisbeth was so tremendous that I couldn't see how this could be as good. One of the first things I noticed was how similar Mara looked to the original actress. As the movie went on I started seeing more and more similarities to the original. I realize that this is based off a book so they will be similar but this to me felt like almost a shot for shot remake. It's been a while since I saw the original but it felt like almost the exact same thing. All that said though the original seemed better to me, I don't know what this was missing but I don't think it was as good. I did like this movie though. Overall, not as good as original but very close. I give it a B.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Really an improvement,"Craig is a really fine actor as well as Rooney Mara. And Fincher is maybe the most interesting director working today. Even though ""The Social Network"" was not as critically as i wished (regarding the disadvantages of www), it shows how impressive a David Fincher work can look.I've although seen the Swedish version, but noomi racpace was a little to old and to muscular for this part. Not that it was bad, but Mara fits so much more in this Lisbeth-Salander-thing that it is obviously who makes the better interpretation.I hope that SONY will stand by what the say and convince Fincher to end his ""own"" Trilogy just like Nolan with his Batman thing.I really enjoyed and recommend the movie to everybody who's interested in adult, thrilling and feel-bad movies of cause! 9 or maybe 9.5/10 for one of the best entertaining movies in the last 12 months",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Nice work from David Fincher,"Not having seen the original Swedish version and not knowing anything about the author, the novels or the previous films and sequels, I approached this movie just as it is: a new work from that genius called David Fincher.After a long, complex, Hans-Ruedi-Giger-esque, not-contents-related main credits sequence —unless you can see something at a deep symbolic level— (and, fair is to say, so eye-catching that you find yourself having a big trouble trying to read the credits texts itself) but nice anyway, Fincher loses (for the first and only time in the movie) sight of his objectives and the narrative he's trying to tell. Yes, very scarce in Fincher's work, he drops the ball and spends at least 10 minutes trying to introduce the characters to the viewer. And he completely fails.After this —the critical period when some percentage of the audience very well could think ""This doesn't make any sense"" and replace the DVD for ""The Birds"" or something), he finds the path again, more precisely when the viewer discovers what the mcguffin is and what the characters and supposed and expected to do to find it out.The movie goes on as a very effective thriller, with all the classic ingredients to maintain you nailed to the seat, and a handful of superb actors that deliver just as needed, and better.The dark, oppressive, claustrophobic visual treatment gives the atmosphere, and the obvious Fincher's directing skills conduct the narration in an impressive, brilliant manner.That's true, this is not a Fincher masterpiece, but, as a standalone picture (and not trying to compare it with its Swedish precedents), this movie works, and functions very well indeed. The disembodied, fleshless violence (at times for no reason at all) represents the jungle in the middle of Scandinavia, and the characters' struggle to find a dark, elusive truth conducts the action until the interesting —yet somewhat foreseeable— climax.All said, if you forgive those clumsy first minutes noted above and wait for the plot to develop, this film could become a very enjoyable experience, particularly for Fincher's visual style fans.Worth seeing? Yes.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Just Brilliant,"Im not such a fan of action. But i can really say i really enjoyed watching this movie there were something captivating in this movie the actors were brilliant the story was mysterious in such a beautiful way. but i really didn't understand the ending when Elizabeth empties accounts that was foe what purpose??? and why she bought him a gift to see him with other girl... and why she would be upset she said they were friends. but this was a brilliant movie everyone should see. Action, mystery , emotional and simply wonderful. Finally I could really say that the movie stole my mind, loved the mystery and how the clues fall down. But what really killed me is seeing the cat killed in this way it broke my heart more than anything else. One more thing , i think the sexual content on the beginning of the movie were unnecessary . but Just wonderful.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Good mystery movie regardless of accuracy vs. original novel,"Disclaimer: I have never read any book of Larsson's series nor I have I watched the Swedish films. Therefore, I started watching the movie with lower expectations than most who have reviewed the movie.I think overall the movie delivers an interesting mystery / semi-thriller which you can ejoy without any previous knowledge of the books.Background is well established and helps understand the motivations of the different categories-Acting is good. Particularly the actress that plays Lisbeth which obviously benefits frmo a very well crafted carachter but still delivers what is a bit of a anti-hero - we root for her the whole time despite being clearly someone whith mental issues and not very capable of living in an organised societythe solution to the main mistery is very engaging - we do want to know who killed Harriet and are moved by Henrik's determination. Equally, the outcome is not that obvious, which is a plus (even if not completely jaw dropping)movie is dark all throughout which really helps to enhance the enigma of it alldespite not being an open ended movie, I felt it does make me wish to have more to find out about these people and their backgrounds",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
An absolute thriller...can't wait for the next 2!,"I can't say that there are many films where I find myself hooked before the movie ever begins.....but, this one ""got me"" as soon as the lights dimmed and the title credits began to flicker on screen. My litmus test for judging films is based upon how long after the film I am still thinking about it. I won't keep you in suspense. When it comes to that test, this film not only passed with flying colors....but totally NAILED it! I will be thinking about ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" for quite some time and, most likely, I will see it again during my holiday vacation. There is so much I want to pay more attention to during the next viewing; even though there are portions in which I will cover my eyes, as well. This is not an easy film to view. There are some pretty graphic sexual and violent scenes. If you are considering whether to see it now, or wait for cable - I assure you, this film is meant to be seen on the big screen. And, this isn't because it is in 3D or some other campy fad...it is because it is an excellent, suspenseful, white knuckler.It would be very easy to say that the one reason to see this film is Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander (the title character) - but that would be too simple....too obvious.....too benign. While this role is pretty much one of the most fascinating characters I've seen on screen for some time, I can honestly say that there are many, many more reasons to view this film. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is a thriller that just doesn't stop. Just when you think it's over and the story is done....it keeps going......as you sit in the theatre on the edge of your seat, as if you are riding the wildest, scariest, most exciting roller coaster you've ever been on. There are times during the film that I found myself squirming in my chair, completely uncomfortable with what was being projected, but unable to look away. I never knew where this film was going; it surprised me....shocked me......thrilled me.I borrowed the book quite a while ago, and I had resisted reading it - as I knew the film was coming out and I purposely didn't want to know very much about the storyline. I could see from the coming attractions that this movie was going to be an adventure and I wanted to ride that adventure.....not knowing the final destination. I am pleased to say that I do not regret that decision. (I will, by the way, read the book now).I will not give away very much of the plot. The film is meant to be experienced. Too much knowledge of the storyline.....would ruin it, in my opinion. Daniel Craig portrays Mikael Blomkvist, an investigative reporter and Rooney Mara portrays the mysterious Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. During the first portion of the film, the plot follows these characters separately....while the viewer is left to consider and wonder what, where, and when the dots will be connected. Both story lines are riveting....as each time the film cut from Craig's character to Mara's character (or vice versa), I found my mind still focused on the previous scene, wondering what was going to happen next.There are quite a few name stars in the film.....(Christopher Plummer, Robin Wright, Joely Richardson)...but the star is the film. I loved the camera work, the direction, the editing...the acting. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is just really, really good film making.There is one particular scene, when an extremely heinous character was figuratively hit with the Karma bus that I actually found myself giving a loud cheer right there in the movie theatre.For the younger crowd, with the short attention spans - you may find yourself having a difficult time getting into the film, as you may be used to multiple car chases and lots of action within the first few minutes of a film. I am going to plead with you to have a bit of patience and allow the story to unfold. When all is not revealed in the first 15 minutes, it is actually plain old good story telling. I know in these days of instant messaging and pop-ups - you may not be used to that....but do give it a chance. You won't be disappointed!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is great!,"I am a huge fan of both the original books, and the Swedish movies, but this movie is a major improvement on the Swedish movie. Essentially, the books could be used as movie scripts, with little done to alter them, and this movie pretty much does that. My biggest complaint is that Lisbeth appears to be wearing ""gang pants"" instead of Goth pants throughout the movie. I don't see her wearing pants with the crotch around her mid-thighs, as that would restrict her movement too much, and she is more likely to be wearing skin-tight pants.They did a good job with the denouement at the end, with Hans Erik Wennerstrom, and also the concluding segment is excellently done. Overall, I was skeptical going in about this movie, and came out excited about seeing the remaining two movies. The original Swedish movies are not nearly as good as they could be on Girl Who Played with Fire and Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest. They portrayed the Millennium staff as a bunch of gutless wimps, when in the books, they were journalists like Steig Larsson, willing to risk their lives to get the truth out to the public! I hope that these productions will stay true to the books on this!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is based upon the novel of the same name by Stieg Larsson and was previously made into a film in 2009 starring Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace and directed by Niels Arden Oplev. This American version of the book (the other version I mentioned was Swedish), stars Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara and is directed by David Fincher. First off I would like to say that I have never read the book of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, or seen the Swedish adaptation either. I know that a couple of years ago the book became immensely popular among avid readers and that two sequels were released with the books and shortly after with the three films done in Sweden and now we have the American version of the first book and film. So having never read the book or having seen the Swedish version, I am going into this film as a newcomer unfamiliar with all of it. When the film first started playing a cover version of Led Zeppelin's The Immigrant Song, to some poorly conceived opening credits, I really had no idea whether I would like this film, or not, and to be honest it did take me a little while to get into it and used to the style of the whole thing, but once I adjusted and got used to the characters and what was going on in the film, I found myself totally enthralled with it and absolutely loving it. The film will definitely not be for everyone because it is very dark and macabre and features some very graphic violence, which I am sure will turn some viewers off. That being said I found the film to be absolutely fascinating. I am not going to give away any of the plot, because many of you going to see it I am sure will have been familiar with either the book, or should I say books, or films. If you have never seen any of them like myself, you will be so captivated by what is going on, you will need no previous knowledge of the films, or books in which to enjoy it. I thought the acting here by the entire cast was absolutely fantastic. Each person did the best job they possibly could and in a film like this, that means taking many risks and even doing a lot of quite physical and demanding work and they all did a terrific job. If the Oscars gave an award for best overall cast in a movie, this should certainly be one of the nominees. The actors each had their own personality to the characters and further enhanced what made them intriguing, different, or even evil. I must also give huge credit to the novelist Stieg Larsson and screenwriter Steve Zaillian, because both have created characters here that are so multi dimensional and they have so many different sides to them that we are not only intrigued and fascinated by them, but we also want to learn even more about them and because of the strong characterization and development we feel for these characters whether it be pity, empathy, or downright fear. I also liked how the characters evolved as the film went on and they were not just the typecast characters that I thought they would be. The film is a mystery and there is so much going on in this film, but it all plays out so well that none of it is boring, or feels useless and the way they crafted and put everything together like this was absolutely brilliant. The musical score as well as the lighting, cinematography and direction further gave depth and feeling to the mood of the film and at types we would feel really fearful, or in a state of suspense, or other times shocked, or even intrigued by what we had just watched. This is a dark and macabre little movie and like I said, it would definitely not be for everyone, but I credit the filmmakers for going with it and not shying away from anything and just producing a sometimes hard to watch, but overall fascinating and mysterious masterpiece. Everything about this film is so masterfully constructed, I think as lot of major film buffs would find it hard not to love, or find a lot to like about this film. The film's director David Fincher directed 2010's The Social Network, which I considered to be the absolute best film of that year and here again he impressed me very much and made what I consider to be the best film of 2011. This guy is definitely going places and has the talent and resume to prove it. This is a hands down masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"Really enjoyed it, have also read the book.","I had read the book by Steig Larsson a few weeks before I watched the film and I really enjoyed it. I always have doubts that a film will live up to the book but in this case, it did the book justice. I can't say that it stuck to book extremely well, but if it had, it would have been a very long film. The film followed the book's story line very well, while keeping the film a sensible length of time. There was nothing that was left out that I thought definitely should have been in the film, and if it was left out, they found a clever way to work it back in. All the environments described in the book were reflected well in the film, I thought Hedeby Island was a very well presented environment in the film, it really gave a life to the book if read again as it gave you a great mental image to use for Hedeby Island. Daniel Craig played the role of 'Mikael Blomkvist' very well. His accent wasn't the best, but we can't blame him as the accent is pretty hard to maintain through out the whole movie. Rooney Mara was a brilliant actress to play 'Lisbeth Salander', she looked exactly like how I pictured Lisbeth while reading the book. She executed Lisbeth's attitude extremely well and acted the rest of her personality very well also. I really hope the next film, if there is one, is as well directed as this one so the story line is followed and the characters are well portrayed. Overall is was a brilliant watch and it doesn't matter if you have read the book first, or have decided to read it after, it will still be a great read and watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Put up with the subtitles,"A very disappointing attempt at this story, ideal for a movie. The problem lies in the casting of both the main characters. The books make it quite clear that Mikael is a middle-aged fairly unfit financial journalist - and as such Daniel Craig is completely miscast. He is far too worldly wise and 'dangerous' to fit the picture painted of Mikael in the books. Fine actor, does a great job of playing the part but too macho. 'Lisbeth' is described as being very petite, indeed she is often mistaken for a young boy, and as such Rooney Mara is also a poor fit for the character - particularly if you have seen the Swedish version in which Noomi Rapace is excellent in the part. Again I accept that Rooney played the part well but she looked wrong, she was too tall and didn't fit the image. You could argue that reading the books prior to seeing this film (and seeing all three Swedish films) was a mistake - and that your image of a character may be wrong - but in this case the late Stieg Larsson (who wrote the books) was very clear in his description of the main characters. I note that no attempt has been made to film the other two books - hopefully that will continue. The original Swedish films are excellent, marred by the subtitles of course, and I think that this is the way to enjoy this series of books. The English language version could have been so much better than it turned out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Fantastic movie? Seriously, what's wrong with you people?","The movie was simply annoying. I wanted to skip forward so badly, but i didn't and now regret it. You people can talk your philosophical crap about how amazing were the actors, sound or whatever you're talking about, but it is what it is. The first 90 minutes are awful and boring as hell. The only interesting scenes were the rape, the blowjob scene and the blackmailing one and i say interesting only cause actually something was happening (the people on screen were moving and others even running!!!). And for God's sake stop being fanboys. I don't care what book or comic this movie came from or if it's a Swedish or Romanian remake, trilogy or else. The fact of the matter is that this movie is boring. The only good thing was Daniel Craig and the acting and if you like a boringly annoying plot and good acting, well....this movie is for you and you will enjoy it.

More like the book,"I have to say I preferred this film to the Swedish version, I had read the books first and then watched films.The thing i liked about the books were the murder mystery aspect alongside the Lisbeth character. The Swedish version missed out so much of the murder mystery element that I enjoyed so much from the books. The American version had a lot more attention to detail and included a greater degree of suspense.At first I found the fast pace of the American version slightly distracting but this passed after 5 or so minutes. I could understand the need for the faster pace and this was to include the details without it being an even longer film.The American version kept more to the books true nature and the feelings of the story more so than the Swedish version which seemed to have a greater political agenda that was barely apparent in the books unless you looked for it ( and more so if you were Swedish ).The opening of the American version was strange though, totally didn't fit with the film and was out of place but was still kind of cool. Would have suited a music video more or the opening of a bond movie ( possibly a marketing ploy because Daniel Craig was in it ).Both movies got the character of Lisbeth right though, neither got the character of Blomkvist right though in my opinion. For me in the books he was a lot more charismatic and articulate but not so wise in his own life. I thought the Swedish film dealt with the relationship between Lisbeth and Blomkvist better however.The book never made it seem like a love story which the American version seemed to imply.Overall the American version was better which was to be expected with a bigger budget but the main thing was that it captured the essence of the books better.The books are always going to be better but a film can translate well to film if it ands the important elements of film making and can suck you in for the 2 odd hours of your life. The Swedish version lacked the tension and mystery for me which was the driving force behind the books alongside the characters ( mainly how intriguing and kind of cool Lisbeth was ).Overall a good film and well put together 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
No smoke without fire,"Having waited before committing to try out this story - I've been burned before and really hated 'rated' oddball films/book adaptations/translations, I have to admit this flick really does pack a punch. A worthy effort that belies the author's knowledge and understanding of an underworld we hardly ever get to see properly. Casting was spot on - I really can't believe that George Clooney was even considered for a role - he's far too full of himself and that's what is telling about the acting in this film. Everything spoken is almost understated - there is a delicacy in the way people in the Nordic countries speak that contrasts with the weight of what they say. This was perfectly conveyed in the English version of the story. Full marks for that and for making us believe that these English speakers were not English/American. I am now convinced that I will gain more from the books and will likely revisit the film again afterwards. ps. Now got the book and on first impressions this film is faithful to the intent of the novel (some variations for obvious cinematic reasons with information derived from the 2nd book ""The Girl Who Played with Fire"").",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Labyrinthine Mystery With An Unattractive Heroine,"'Dragon Tattoo' is an excellent mystery movie with an absorbing storyline. I always liked mysteries with a time lapse involved, and in this one the murder was committed in the 60's. The time frame, however is contemporary Sweden and has an interesting premise; it was committed on an island connected to the mainland by a bridge, but which was blocked at the time of the murder by a car crash - no one got off the island, no one got on.Daniel Craig is investigating at the behest of Christopher Plummer, the patriarch of the family, who wants the answer before it is too late as he is elderly. Rooney Mara is Craig's assistant, a semi-autistic social cripple with a Goth look. Plummer adds immeasurable stature to the film and Mara has obviously worked hard to create an off-beat character and succeeds too well. I thought her characterization was off-putting and couldn't work up much sympathy for her, and that she detracted from the story, which as mentioned was first-rate.I didn't read the book or see the Swedish version of the film, but this picture was too long, with gratuitous scenes of the stars in coitus, and efforts to depict Mara's character as beset with troubles. Also, there is a back-story of a libel suit against Craig, which some people might find interesting (I didn't). I just felt it could have been cut down to a better, shorter version with additional editing, but that's just me. In movies I don't think that more is better. If they make movie versions of the other two books they should de-emphasize 'THE GIRL' stuff and just go with the mysteries, as this one was really very good.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Nice t-shirt!,"I saw ""THE GIRL IN THE SPIDER'S WEB"" first, so I was expecting an action-thriller. This one is more of a detective-thriller.

Lisbeth is still a cool character, and Rooney Mara plays her very well. I was also quite fond of Daniel Craig's performance. I just didn't find the ""what happened to Harriet?"" storyline to be all that interesting. I think I cared more about what happened to Cat?",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Movie of the year came early this year.,"The Swedisch translation of the Stieg Larsson novel couldn't be more perfect in my eyes. The devotion of the actors in playing their role is excellent.Rooney Mara played an incredible and truthful role as Lisbeth Salander. It is incredible how devoted she has played this role with a lot of violence and explicit scenes. Her real piercings and other visual characteristics, her Swedisch accent and her incredible acting skills made her a perfect Lisbeth Salander.""The Immigrant Song"" cover by Trent Reznor and Karen O made a big impression to me as in the trailer as in the movie itself. It created a nice atmosphere for the rest of the movie.In the movie, there are a lot of dialogs, but they aren't as complicated as you have in a lot of other movies. Also, the dialogs are so well written, you never get bored during the entire movie, they are always followed by an action scene of something exciting that has happened. You really get into the story so you wont't notice the movies duration of 158 minutes.Also the interaction with the main characters showed Daniël Craig in one of his better acting roles. The interaction between Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist is that convincing that you want to see a sequel as soon as the ending scene of this movie has passed.It looks like David Fincher looked a lot at the original movie and improved all the shortcomings to make this film a perfect translation of the original story. The interaction between the characters is better and you feel like there is a lot more that needs to be said and done, hopefully in the sequel. Therefore I would - at this early time of the year - say it's the movie of the year.I'm also convinced Rooney Mara will get an Oscar for this performance.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Doesn't compare to the original,"The most important thing I can say is, just see the original Swedish movie. This one doesn't provide the same feeling as the original at all. Everything down to the score for the film is off. They aren't as clear when telling the story in this version either. Rooney, while learning the mannerisms and portraying Lisbeth to the best of her abilities just simply doesn't have the right look at all. She looks like a soft small child playing dress up rather than a worn abused yet tough young woman that Noomi Rapace portrays so well. Noomi has the sharp angular features that give her a tough serious look while Rooney is softer and sweeter looking. I probably won't watch the other U.S. versions once they come out.

Old fashion thriller,"First of all I have to say that I didn't read the book or saw the other films. To me this was a first hand experience into a story I tried not to read about.

The acting is amazing, especially Rooney Mara (Lisbeth), however everyone does an awesome job.We all know there are three books and we assume that they will be doing a second and a third movie and I can't wait.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Don't let 'that' scene put you off, this is well worth checking out","Speaking as someone who has not seen the Swedish adaptation of the famous series or read the books for that matter, I had little to go by on what to expect other than what i had seen in the trailers and heard about from friends, so I was going into the film fresh and I can say that I highly recommend it.As with The Social Network, Fincher strikes the perfect balance between involving the audience with all the information on screen while not overloading them at the same time. It is tricky to do, but with his talent in directing, the film's two hour plus running-time goes by in a flash. The film is in many ways a master-class in all that it does; from perfectly honed performances to the fantastic editing (edited by the Oscar winning team who did The Social Network and won again for this).Prior to this Rooney Mara had a only a few noticeable roles to mention, but does a fantastic job settling in as the film's protagonist, Lisbeth. Daniel Craig gives a subtle understated performance as her partner who work together to solve a 40-year old plus murder. Supporting actors including Christopher Plummer and Stellan Skarsgård are also brilliant.The only weakness that I can think to mention is that we are sometimes unsure of who the main suspects are as the film moves at such a pace, however this is not Scooby Doo and the film features several scenes to remind you of that.Whether or not Fincher chooses to continue with the series, he has made yet another fantastic film that is well worth checking out but not when eating.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Excellent mystery + drama + crime movie,"As far as the story of the movie is concerned, one of the best well written mystery movies that also includes some part of drama and a little bit of romance. The movie also contains some violent and sexual scenes, so parents need to be careful.Rooney Mara has done an excellent work in the movie. The character she has played is make the movie alive.

"Stunning and Subdued, a Perfect Film","Having read all the books, and watched the Swedish versions of the films, I could not be happier with Fincher's film. It is spot on. That je ne sais quoi of the stunning and the subdued in harmony, that is so difficult to achieve, but so necessary to film like this, is flawlessly executed.I think Reznor was an excellent choice for the soundtrack, and he did a phenomenal job. I never felt as if the music was out of place or intrusive.There are a few story changes, but ultimately they make for a better movie. I'm sorry to have to disagree with those of you who prefer the Swedish films, and think the first Swedish film is better. The cinematography in Oplev's version is excellent, the acting is first rate, but ultimately the film is a disappointment. It is incoherent, and oftentimes jarring. Had I not read the books before watching Oplev's version, I would not have been able to follow it. Fincher's film is nearly perfect. Every change has a purpose and benefits the film.It goes without saying, Rooney Mara is absolutely amazing. But I also thought Daniel Craig was an unexpected, and wonderful, choice. For those who claim Mara outshined him, yes, she did, and no, she didn't. Who is the shocking, scene-stealing, surprising one? Salander? Or Blomkvist? Craig played his part true to the novel. He is a subdued fellow. He is not dramatic. He is never over-the-top. He does not brood. What were you people expecting? Craig was Blomkvist. Had he acted any differently, it would have changed the story, and not for the better.Whether you have read the novels or not, see the film. It will bash you over the head on the one hand, and slowly seep into you on the other. I still can't stop thinking about it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Solid book to movie adaptation,"This movie was able to successful adapt the book to the big screen. It had some good acting, high level quality production, and good twists and turns from the story.

Languages do not make or ruin a good movie. English Version is Better by 1000 Miles!!!,"I'm going to begin by saying that I read the books first, watched the 2009 films afterwards, and I have just come back from seeing Fincher's adaptation for the second time. And Fincher's is by far the superior of the films. I am no stranger to the story and experienced it in the ""proper order"" as many elitist fans would call it. (While the ever more elitist ""fans"" would not have even watched Fincher's version). Fincher's Direction is superior; Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross's musical genius sets the perfect tone for the film, and best of all, the cast lends themselves to a brilliant story in ways that I believe would be irreproducible by any other actor/actress. I may be blasphemous for saying this but I don't care. Rooney Mara nailed the role better than Noomi Rapace and I look forward to Fincher's future endeavours with Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist in coming years. And as for you people who are ever insistent on the same lame-@$$ed arguments to appear like you know what everyone else ""should"" enjoy...original languages do not make a movie good. ""Passion of the Christ"" was not more enriching because it was in Arabic. Not wanting to read subtitles is not a curse of the Lazy Man and the fact that you do does not mean you are more intelligent, cultured, or artistic. It means you are boastful,arrogant, and are looking for something to make you feel superior instead of going to watch a movie for a good story. If you want to be 100% pure in your Stieg Larsson enjoyment, learn Swedish, move to Stockholm, and bask in the glory that is your raging unmerited self esteem. If a language is reason for you not to enjoy something, you've missed the point entirely of watching a movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
OK - could have been better,"If I had a wish, it would be that I had seen this version before the Swedish version. That isn't the case however. After having seen the Swedish one, I have to admit I wasn't hooked for the first hour. And we rarely say that of a Fincher flick. I liked the second half of the movie a lot though. It was fast-paced, gripping and played out well. Rooney Mara was very good in my opinion, and Oscar-worthy too; I found more than a handful of reviews that said she was 'boring' but that isn't the case, it takes a lot of boldness to shoot those more-than-usual explicit scenes and she did them with almost a Lisbeth-like quality. But Daniel Craig was quite disappointing. He didn't seem involved enough. Seriously I don't know why Fincher wanted him or the role so badly - I was against it from the very beginning. Good but I expect more from the sequel(s). 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Potential perfection for the story,"David Fincher's The girl with the Dragon Tattoo is almost absolute perfection in the medium of film. Rooney Mara's performance is electrifying as she breathes new life and vitality into this already told story. What happened is instead of trying to live up to Noomi Rapace's Lisbeth she read the book and adopted a Lisbeth of her own! All in all making this a fantastic performance.David Fincher does a great job of giving the movie a dark feel, like I believe from reading the books that it deserved. Add this great dark feel to a wonderful soundtrack by reznor/ross and you have a movie nearing perfection. The story is brilliantly told and the thrill of the mystery and detective work reigns through in great form.This is a movie that definitely hit the mark and everyone should go out and see!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo: 7/10,"David Fincher never fails me, even including the underwhelming THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON (2008) (which I think I seriously need a re-watch), the American remake of THWTDT is as excellent as its Swedish archetype if not excels in every aspect.Karen O's Led Zeppelin cover Immigrant Song serves as the explosive opening track and dovetails with Fincher's surreal MV-esque opening credit, instantly enhancing the thrill upon to an adrenaline-driven index, eye-dashing, jaw-dropping, so up-to-the-minute yet bespeaks its own attitude, a thriller hipster for this age.The storyline slightly differs from the original Sweden version (the ending is more agreeable for me, a sympathetic outline of Lisbeth plainly strengthens her character with additional authenticity and pathos. I also prefer the cast in this American version, Daniel Craig manages to embellish his rugged complexion with an anti-Bond vulnerability and a morally passive average-Joe journalist, subjectively I opt him over Michael Nyqvist. As for Rooney Mara, under Fincher's guidance, her Tomboy bent (inwardly in particular) has been exploited to an uppermost bloom, the rape-and-vengeance scenes are the aces in the hole (with a more genial appearance of the pervert by Yorick van Wageningen), compared to Noomi Rapace, I just admire Mara more and it's super to see her to re-enact such a ground-breaking female role fervently and sparks dynamically in just 2 years. I must say she is a more attractive girl to any extent . Among the supporting group, Stellan is creepily swell and happy to see a Penn-free Robin Wright with her new look, fringe does make a difference!Trent & Atticus Ross' score is another feat (after a victory foray in THE SOCIAL NETWORK 2010 with new buddy Fincher), the pervasive, humming, quasi-vibration background soundtrack is like a prolonged Post-Rock/Experimental album, highlights the narrative turbulence along the way, until the notoriously basement scene about slaughter fetish. Also Jeff Cronenweth's stunning cinematography is another Oscar-bait, good luck on the Oscars, after snagging a surprising DGA nomination for Fincher and a steady Box Officer implementation, I hope it could make some upheaval in this year's languid Oscar race.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
It Makes Us Looking Forward to The Girl Who Set Fire on the Hornet's Nest,"It takes a great challenge for a movie director to do a remake of a popular movie, especially when it is based on best selling novel. David Fincher has taken the challenge to do a remake of the highly popular Millennium Trilogy, and he did it. He has delivered a splendid American remake of the Swedish drama series, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. Daniel Craig takes up the role of Mikael Blomkervist, and Rooney Mara plays Lisbeth Salander. Together, the trio have given us the feel bad movie of Christmas.The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo marks the first chapter of Millennium Trilogy, with Mikael the journalist and Lisbeth, a computer hacker, working together to investigate the case of a missing girl, Harriet Vanger. Harriet was believed to be murdered by one of her family member when she goes missing 40 years ago. At the same time, Mikael is under trial for defamation of a entrepreneur, while Lisbeth is surviving from a rape which could have unlikely to happened on her.While Fincher gives a fully explained details in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2009), which was based on a short story written by F.Scott Fitzgerald, it takes a challenge to summarize a 644 pages story written by the late Swedish author Stieg Larsson into a 2hr 38 min movie. Fincher not only did it, but also makes the US remake truly lives up to the novel. Audience get a better understanding on Lisbeth's lifestyle and attitude towards her surrounding, such as being reserved at work, living as a bisexual computer hacker, survives from rape and develops affection on her working partner Mikael. To understand how Mikael turns Millennium magazine into a magazine that exposes corporate scandals, it can be seen from the way how he investigates the disappearance of Harriet Vanger. This is how we see Fincher wants to tell the audience on the working style for Mikael without repeating Mikael's working style, which was featured at the beginning of the novel.Editing plays a very important role in this US remake. In the first half of the movie, Mikael and Lisbeth were presented as two different persons with very different lifestyle, which goes concurrently without overlapping each other. Towards the next half of the film, both met each other by working in the investigation on the disappearance of Harriet Vanger, which eventually leads to the discovery of the sinister secrets of the Vanger family. The pace is fast, direct without making one feeling bored. Rather, it engages the audience, making them wanting to know more. This is another reason why the movie is a success. What it lacks, however, is a deeper exploration on Lisbeth's personality. While it was explained in the Swedish version of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, it was not seen in the US remake.In some way, the US remake makes up what was lacking in the Swedish version. The opening credits are created specially for the US remake, compared to the usual credits run over on movie scenes. This gives audience the reason they should arrive the theaters early to catch them. Observant audience will know that the opening credits covers the title of the trilogy: a dragon tattoo on the black female body (The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo), a burning matchstick and a burning body (The Girl Who Played With Fire) and hornets flying out of a girl's mouth (The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest). The credits are marvelously accompanied by Karen O, Trent Renzor and Atticus Ross modern reprise of Led Zeppelin's The Immigrant Song.With a marvelous US remake of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, it gives us the reason to look forward to the US remake of The Girl Who Played With Fire. Now, all we want is to revisit Mikael and Lisbeth, the unlikely pair, to unveil more dark secrets.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The rare American remake that beats the original.,"Having watched and thoroughly enjoyed the Swedish language versions of the millennium trilogy, (the girl with the dragon tattoo, the girl who played with fire, & the girl who kicked the hornets nest) I was very interested in seeing what the amazing David Fincher would bring to the table with his American version. I was not disappointed. This movie is better in almost every aspect. Fincher's trademark flare for creating dark ominous visual mood succeeds in adding a level of tension that is sorely lacking in the original. Having loved the character Lisbeth Salander played by Noomi Rapace in the original and by Rooney Mara in this remake, i must admit both actresses are strong and fierce in their individual portrayals. However, I give a slight edge to Mara due to the fact that her performance is just as ferocious and powerful as Rapace's but simultaneously Mara gives the character an undercurrent of wounded/fragile vulnerability that is mostly absent from Rapace's more cold, emotionless, and cyborglike portrayal. Also Mara's Lisbeth has a more bizarre appearance which enhances Lisbeth's disaffected sociopathic qualities.I would also point out that the soundtrack work of frequent Fincher collaborator (the incomparable) Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, adds a further layer of industrial gloom to the mood of this version. Daniel Craig isn't much of an actor in my opinion, but his presence adds a level of credibility to the courage displayed by his character. The original actor seemed a bit unbelievable in the role. All in all an excellent film that trumps the original in almost every way. There are a few flaws which are carried over from the original, such as a long slow and confusing expository stage wherein the enormous complexity and the long sordid history of the Vanger family is revealed. Yet even in this part, Fincher is able to succeed in surpassing the original by creating an almost quasi-montage of researching scenes that speeds the pacing of this section along and is more enjoyable to watch than the same portion of the original film. Here is hoping Fincher returns to continue the trilogy, and that American audiences are more receptive to the 2nd and 3rd movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"I hate to say it, but more rounded than Fincher's version","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has been a worldwide phenomenon for a while now. In book form, the original film, and the Hollywood remake. It is a disturbing, yet riveting tale, as is the story behind the author who made it. While Fincher's version is visually and stylistically more striking, I feel this original Swedish film does a better job bringing the disturbing mystery to the silver screen. Structured much more fluidly than the Hollywood version, the mystery of a missing girl flows and develops slowly, dishing out red herrings and suspense with each turn (something lacking in the Fincher version). It also stays closer to the original title of the book (and theme) Men who Hate Women. In the end, this is a dark tale of what rape does to women and to the world. Not everyone's idea of 'entertainment,' but a thought-provoking mystery for those with strong stomachs.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Swedish thrillers don't get much better than this,"Although this Swedish version of 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' was followed by two sequels and an English language film a couple of years ago directed by David Fincher, it is very much the best of the four films.It is a very loyal adaptation of the book (generally one of the most faithful book-to-film adaptations around), which is a fantastic read and has become of my favourite books recently, adhering closely to many of the book's events and such and also perfectly maintaining the bleak and murky atmosphere the book effortlessly creates. However, 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' works even better on its own terms. The central relationship between Mikail and Lisbeth is ever so slightly rushed, however it still resonates while wisely not taking over the story too much (doing a much better job in this aspect than Fincher's.Fincher's version may be more audacious visually, though this film is a long way from a hack job, and the script here does occasionally lack polish and flow. However, the atmosphere is much more effective here and there is generally more tension and chills, and personally prefer the performances here too (though Rooney Mara in Fincher's film is certainly no slouch).Enough with the comparisons. 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' (2009) does look great, the bleakness of the setting adds so well to the atmosphere and it's tightly edited and very nicely shot. The haunting and doom-laden score fills one with dread and creates a lot of rich tension. Neil Arden Oplev's directing is masterful, building on the tension and suspense to frightening heights while also directing with a lot of class.'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo's' story is incredibly gripping, there is a lot of subplots and characterisation and the film remarkably makes everything intriguing, layered and complete. The long running time allows this to happen admittedly, but with a good deal going on and with deliberate pacing the film easily could have rushed through things or neglected aspects but very rarely does those things. The subplots are superbly chilling with constant and effortless delivery of shock after shock. The bleak and murky atmosphere is present throughout, as is the dark and at times brutal (but not gratuitously so) tone, with plenty of twists and turns that shock and surprise better than a lot of thrillers from the US.All the acting is very good indeed, but it's the two leads that really impress. Michael Nyqvist makes his vulnerable and flawed character a fascinating character that could have been less complex in lesser hands, but the film does belong to Noomi Rapace, whose seamlessly enigmatic performance is positively screen-burning.Overall, a great film and one of not many book-to-film adaptations that treats its source material with respect.

A Worthy & Different Crime Mystery When Compared To American Films Of The Genre,"An intrigue fueled slow building thriller, ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" is a refreshingly different take on the ""whodunit"" crime genre. This Swedish movie has loads of great cinematography, taking advantage of the beautiful Swedish country side as well as framing the eerie story. The principal characterizations are quite well suited by the cast who fit naturally in the roles they play with great realism. Like I have already noted this is a much different presentation as compared with American filmed crime thrillers. Even though this obviously has a well-funded budget it is grittier and less commercialized thus lending a realism over glossiness. The music score also adds quite a bit of ominous darkness.I guess if you want to be overly critical you could punch a hole or two here or there, but I think this story comes off so most all viewers will ignore any inconsistencies in favor of the mysterious pieces which, eventually, add up, but not too fast – keeping the viewer invested and hoping to figure out how it may all end.Though graphic at times, it isn't ""porn-horror"", ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" is a dark story where the unsettling pieces fit. I am fairly certain it will not be released in the US, but if you can see it do so as it is a well crafted and executed drama.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A captivating piece of cinema!,"The music lends a threatening aspect to the opening scene, where we in slow close ups  on and off deliberately out of focus  get to follow the opening of a package. Inside the package, post marked in Hong Kong, is a framed plant. The camera starts to move backwards, taking in more of the room and revealing Sven-Bertil Taube as the opener of the package. He holds the frame in his hands, lowers his head and slowly starts to cry.Niels Arden Oplevs Män som hatar kvinnor is based on the first of Stieg Larssons three bestselling novels, meaning of course that it is basically guaranteed large box office numbers  but the expectations will probably match those numbers. Weather the film manages to live up to these expectations I cannot say  seeing as I am one of the probably only eight people who has not read Stieg Larssons books. But as a piece of cinema, completely removed from its literary origins, it definitely leaves an impression!The music mentioned above, written by Peter Fuchs, is the first thing to register in the mind as something interesting Something that make everything feel very serious. The impending-doom-score composed by Howard Shore, for David Finchers Se7en, springs to mind  and this only a few seconds into the film.The cold, hard, uncomfortable reality  where the movie takes place  is populated by a highly recognizable legion of people straight out of Swedens acting elite (Gösta Bredenfeldt, Lena Endre, Ewa Fröling, Björn Granath, Peter Haber och Marika Lagerkrantz to mention a few) and they all seem to have been so thrilled to be a part of this project that they almost as one has taken their characters a step back, allowing the spotlight to be shone on the two main characters, who also get to drive the story forward; the reporter Mikael Blomkvist (Mikael Nyqvist), who is digging through a 40 year old murder case involving a well known corporation family with Nazi connections, and the 24 year old computer hacker EMO Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) that every day hacks Blomkvists hard drive, captivated by the puzzling evidence (or lack thereof).Nyqvist gets the job done playing what is basically the lesser of the two parts. You instinctively feel sympathy for him, and sympathizes with him  even in his very first scene, in which his character is convicted of slander, and sentenced to prison.But when the lights come back on in the theatre, and you gather up your half eaten box of popcorn and your coat, it's not Mikael Nyqvists understated but persistent reporter you will remember mostit's Noomi Rapaces leather-and-stud clad, tattooed, pierced, heavy makeup wearing biker chick, Lisbeth Salander.Weighted by old wrongdoings as well as new ones, Lisbeth is covered in emotional scars, making her a very interesting character  that easily could have been a silly rehash, a Gunvald Larsson in leather. But Noomi Rapace bases Lisbeth in real emotions rather than clichés and hammy over acting. You can tell that there is a real person behind that steely gazed, unyielding face, something that make those parts of the movie, where we get to come with her through what must be some of Swedish cinemas most horrendous scenes, feel that much more awful. You almost can't help looking away, as she is abused over and over againThe relationship between Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander is the only part where I felt the movie rushed things just a tad. But this is only a mild piece of criticism, as the lack of insight leaves the audience feeling that they, just like the character Mikael Blomkvist, don't know what to make of Lisbeht Salander.Besides the two leads, I want to single out Peter Haber, who really got to show off his skills! He is obviously good for more than just playing the silly father of Sune or the annoyingly correct police Martin Beck.I have, like I mentioned earlier, not read the novels by Stieg Larsson, and I have an automatic aversion towards Swedish cinema; which I usually find stiff, with acting taken straight out of the latest grocery store commercials. In other words, Swedish film has its work cut out trying to sell me anything. But, and I am not ashamed to admit this, I'm gonna go ahead and BUY!!!In the narrow little world that is Swedish cinema there is a lot that one could  or even should  avoid. But this movie is not something to be ignored!

"well crafted, engaging and thought-provoking thriller","I am among, I guess, those very few people in Europe who have not read the best-selling novel by Stieg Larsson, but, not feeling in the mood to see another too emotionally engaging romance or drama, although its being my favourite genre, I went to see what is depicted by Larsson's fans as a captivating and gripping thriller.Indeed, I can't say whether the movie proves adherence to the novel, which is something by the way difficult, considering the length of the book, however, I can say that the product is a well-crafted piece of cinema, which leaves also interesting food for thought. Used as we are, as southern Europeans, to see at Northern, and mainly Scandinavian countries, as models of democracy, economic progress and social welfare, it's quite surprising to see a modern Sweden stained by corruption and unscrupulous tycoons. Moreover, it is quite upsetting to get to know how Nazi extremist and insane ideas were rooted not so much in the history of the country, but in the conscience of people, in this case of a powerful and wealthy family, where the hatred towards the Jews has mixed with the hatred towards women, turning the lives of whole generations into a hell of ferocious violence and horror.As far as the thriller story, it's engaging, but carried on very carefully, every aspect being under control, with flashbacks constantly reassuring us about aspects we have already perceived, without moving a little apart from a well consolidated stylistic model of this kind of movie genre. Sometimes a little slow, sometimes too indulging in violent scenes, but with a strong directing consciousness supporting it. Convincing and really good the performances offered by the whole cast, unknown to the great public, but I would underline the actress playing Lisbeth as really outstanding and upsetting in her mental and emotional distress. On the whole, it's not a masterpiece, but a good and well made movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Epic in length only,"The copy of this I rented has the presentation of a feature film, but I think it may have been edited from a Swedish television series adapting a trilogy of novels, of which this is the first. This version is a little over two and a half hours, but the IMDb notes that there is a fuller three hour version which I'm guessing might have been the original TV presentation. What was in that extra half hour? It might contain material that answers some of the criticisms I make below, but I wouldn't want to bet on it.The basic plot is that an investigative journalist, smarting from losing a libel case brought by a corrupt businessman, and facing a jail sentence (for libel? They must do things differently in Sweden), is hired by a wealthy businessman impressed with his integrity to investigate the disappearance, decades earlier, of his niece. The businessman is convinced (for reasons that are not entirely clear) that she must have been murdered by a member of his family (note that this is a very old-fashioned family-based capitalist enterprise, on the Buddenbrooks model).With over two and half hours to explore, one might hope for some real plot and character development and some fine dramatic scenes, but the drama is almost entirely dead. Here are some of the things we don't get (I could list more, but am avoiding spoilers):We get very little idea what the family enterprise actually is. There's a photo of a ship;are they shipbuilders, perhaps? Or are they just exporting goods?Though the family are mostly gathered on the island, and the investigator assembles a handy photographic family tree, we scarcely get to meet most of them, even less witness any dramatic interplay between them. I remember one scene only in which the family actually get together to attempt to deter the investigator.We have been assured by the patriarch that the family are greedy, grasping,selfish vipers, but we are treated to none of the dramatic or satirical fun that might come from this.Though the island has great symbolic significance, it has no cinematic presence at all. The bridge that we are assured is the only way on or off the island might just as well be a bridge across a river for all the difference it makes.There is little sense of remoteness, isolation or confinement.There is a dark undercurrent of previous Nazi involvement. But this is just stated baldly, as a fact. We get very little idea of what this meant or even really when it was. During the war? Neo-nazi revivalism? Both? And apart from the fact that we can take it as given that Nazis are nasty people, there is no attempt to explore how this actually affects their actions and beliefs.More simply, what we have here is the Swedish equivalent of an English country house murder, basically dealing with the rich and privileged, and with the cast of suspects conveniently assembled in a single location. But instead of the detective teasing out the solution by interrogating the suspects, playing them off against each other, and catching them out, all we get is seemingly endless shots of the investigator or his computer-whiz sidekick tap-tap-tapping away on their laptops (Apple Macs, if you must know, and heaven knows you get long enough to admire the speed and smoothness of the software).Look, I know that the Internet and cheap computing has brought about a revolution in thinking and behaving and that film-makers are struggling to come to terms with it, but let me propose a general working rule for film-makers. Computers are not dramatically interesting.It's like voice-over. You can get away with it a bit, and sometimes it can even enhance a film; but if you find yourself relying on the voice-over, then chances are you've gone wrong. You're failing to tell the story properly in the medium of cinema, and if it's just a straight narration, your audience would be better off reading a book. So it is with computers and internet investigations. You can have a secondary character who's a computer expert, or you can have one episode of intensive computer use if the plot absolutely requires it. But if you find that the whole drama relies on it, or worse, that you have to fill all your screen-time showing it, then you can be sure you've gone badly wrong. Your audience would be better off surfing the net themselves, or composing electronic music, or photoshopping their snapshots, or playing games.What was that? Oh, yes, the sidekick. Well, that's the woman ""with the dragon tattoo"", though why she has it I still don't know. It's just the title of the film. She's a young lesbian punk, though hilariously, as in every middle-aged liberal man's fantasy, the investigator succeeds in ""turning"" her just by the sheer non-sexist force of his personality. Oddly enough, she has her own sub-plot, involving a corrupt ""probate guardian"" (I think that's a subtitle mistranslation for parole or probation officer), which is much more interesting than the main story, but over rather quickly. This I think, properly scripted, would have made a much more rewarding film of about the standard 90 minute length.And the libel case comes back at the very end, though bizarrely it seems to have nothing to do with the main story. True enough, life's generally not like that, and not everything is connected, but it is characteristic of the scriptwriter's complete absence of any sense of drama that this opportunity to create some dramatic unity is muffed.The flashes of sexual violence, just about acceptably presented as would befit a television programme, are nothing more than a desperate attempt to inject some artificial edginess into this ditchwater dull plodding drama.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Great Movie!!!,"I saw this movie in Sydney, Australia and it was really great. A really good thriller!. I have read all three of the books and wondered how the movie would be. The theatre was packed and it was in subtitles but you could hear a pin drop. We were all glued to the screen. Once it gets going your are hooked! At the end everyone clapped. Some of the scenes are graphic and violent but if you have read the book you already know this. However, even though I had to ""read"" the movie I cant wait for the next one. At least I hope they are making a movie for book 2 and 3 I would not take my 14yr old to this but it is something I would see again. Highly recommend!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Dark Thriller,"While I haven't read the books/novels, I enjoyed the movie very much. Even if it's only part 1 of the trilogy, it still feels like a movie that has a beginning and an ending. I can't say how that works in the books, but the translation to the screen seems really good (voting here underlines that).While thrillers are mostly considered TV material and this one might borderline on that fine edge, it still deserves to be seen on the big screen. The actors (mostly unrecognizable to the worldwide audience) are really good. The editing and pacing is great and it's really a great suspense movie. A little thriller that dares to go to dark places.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Better version than Fincher's movie.,"This movie was more plot oriented than 2011 version(hollywood one).I've seen both and 2009 version is much better.I found 2009 version more gripping while i was not even finding Fincher's version interesting,it was too slow.

Grim but absorbing,"This is a grim and gritty tale lightened somewhat by an upbeat ending. Its origins as the first novel in the millennium series by Stieg Larrson is evident in a somewhat meandering storyline and a running time of two and a half hours, with the inevitable excisions from the book. Nevertheless the film stands up well on its own.Sweden seems to produce detectives at the end of their tethers, ""Wallander"" for example, and the protagonist here, Mikael a journalist, starts out facing three months in jail for defaming a shonky business tycoon. I thought criminal defamation was a thing of the past, but not it seems in Sweden. Mikael has been set up, but the case has brought him to the notice of Henrick Vander, the patriarch of an old industrial family, who commissions Mikael to investigate the disappearance of his favourite niece, who disappeared from the family's island retreat nearly 40 years ago. Mikael joins forces with the tiny but intimidating Lisbeth, an ace computer hacker with a dark past and an agenda of her own.They soon discover that the Vander family, except for their client who is a nice old gent, are as about a dysfunctional a family as you might ever meet, on a par with the Essenbecks of Visconti's ""The Damned"". There are skeletons everywhere, not just in the closet. However Mikael and Lisbeth crack the case, after the usual quota of menacing moments and dashing around chasing red herrings and actual clues. Filmed in the midst of a Swedish winter the atmosphere is pretty gloomy, not to mention just plain cold.Michael Nyqvist inhabits the role of Mikael pretty comfortably, spending quite a lot of time looking surprised, but Nooni Rapace as Lisbeth is something else again – practically an elemental force – never was someone so vulnerable and so dangerous at the same time.Nit-pickers will be delighted to learn that in a short sequence set in outback northern Australia, Mikael's FWD has the correct licence plates and its steering wheel on the right. However the lighting was most peculiar and the sheep a bit out of place – you mostly see cattle in northern Australia.There are apparently two sequels in the pipeline, and despite some rather grisly moments I will line up to see them. Larrson, who died suddenly after producing three best-sellers, was a good storyteller and the film-makers have executed the adaptation with plenty of skill.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Decent but becomes progressively less interesting,"I basically enjoyed this film, as reflected in my rating but it is certainly flawed.My preconception before watching the film, based upon the images of the main character, was that this was quite possibly a film that gets a lot of it's traction from the beauty of it's female star - dressed up in that Gothic she's-a-bit-disturbed kind of Matrix chic.I was pleasantly surprised that the eponymous character does actually have some depth, and didn't have me groaning at tank grrrl clichés too often.The film then heads off into what seem to me kind of interesting waters and is gearing up to be intelligent, well-paced, suspenseful and unconventional.The problems arise when the film starts tying the mysteries up. The kind of devices that you would dismiss in a TV drama as being clichés, start surfacing with alarming regularity... It becomes more difficult to suspend your credibility... Things take on an increasingly BBC 2 Poirot kind of feel.Then when you feel that the story has been told, the film continues for another unnecessary 20 minutes or so, most of that time spent spelling things out in a slightly patronising way..The final scene seems well and truly out of place. People may say that ""if you read the book it all makes sense""... Maybe, but this isn't the book, and the film needs to stand on it's own two feet.So I would say this is half a good film, and half a late night TV murder mystery. Worth seeing but doesn't live up to the hype in my opinion.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Excellent thriller,"This Swedish film is one of the best thrillers I've seen in a long time. Based on a best seller novel by Stieg Larsson I haven't read (the first in a trilogy), it starts with Mikael, a middle aged investigative journalist being asked by the old patriarch of a powerful business clan to solve the disappearance of his beloved 16 year old nephew forty years ago. Since this happened during a family reunion at an isolated island, the patriarch believes that she was murdered, and that only a member of the family could have done so. Mikael is soon joined in the investigation by Lisbeth Salander, a troubled but brilliant twenty something female hacker, and soon they are lifting the veil on the very dark secrets behind this prestigious family. Gripping throughout, the film benefits from a number of terrific performances, especially Noomi Rapace playing Lisbeth Salander and Sven Bertil Taube as the patriarch of the clan. While the film is more than two hours long, it is never boring, and all the loose ends are tied brilliantly at the end.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
a veritable multi-pack of overused plots and devices,"I'll start by saying that I've not read the book and am reserving judgement, but after squirming in my seat for around two and a half hours it's not looking good. In addition I usually find your mainstream thrillers and crime dramas gut rottingly dull.What you get with this film is a clumsy crime thriller who's main protagonist is a dark, complex, but poorly drawn female. A good portion of the film is spent justifying her eccentricity in a series of gratuitous scenes where she is made to perform sexual acts. I understand the theme of men who hate women etc. My problem is that it seems to be saying the only reason someone could be like this is through some kind of abuse or tragedy. I find this sort of logic simplistic and annoying. The scenes themselves are a cheap way to get you to feel something for the character. That said Noomi Rapace does an excellent job considering the drivel she is given to work with - she almost manages to polish a turd. The acting from her supporting cast is clunky to say the least. No-one else really comes across as believable.Enough said I'm not going to waste any more of my life on this howler. I advise you to do the same.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
One of the Best Films of the Year,"In Stockholm, the investigative journalist and chief-editor of the magazine Millennium Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) is sentenced to three months in prison for slandering the corrupt entrepreneur Hans-Erik Wennerström (Stefan Sauk) in an article. Meanwhile the wealthy industrialist Henrik Vanger (Sven- Bertil Taube) and his lawyer Dirch Frode (Ingvar Hirdwall) hire the Milton Security to investigate the life of Mikael, and the hacker Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) finds that he is an honest man. Mikael is invited to travel to Hedeby Island near Hedestadt to meet Henrik at his home and the old man proposes him to investigate who murdered his beloved nephew Harriet that disappeared forty years ago. Mikael moves to Hedeby Island and Henrik delivers all the files of the case. The journalist learns that all the members of the dysfunctional Vanger family are suspect and the three brothers of Henrik were Nazis. Meanwhile Lisbeth is hacking Mikael's computer and she decides to help him with further information about the case. Henrik hires Lisbeth to help Mikael and they discover a series of hideous murders connected to the disappearance of Harriet.""Män Som Hatar Kvinnor"" is one of the best films of the year. The engaging suspense is very well developed, with many characters and subplots that are perfectly resolved without any flaw. Niels Arden Oplev has a tight direction, supported by an excellent screenplay and outstanding cast. Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace in the roles of an investigative journalist and an emotionally disturbed hacker respectively deserve nominations to the Oscar for their top-notch performances. Unfortunately it seems that the American cinema industry is preparing to destroy this awesome film with another remake. The Brazilian title gives a different meaning since ""Män Som Hatar Kvinnor"" means ""Men Who Hate Women"".

"Good, Taut Thriller with Excellent Character Development","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, or as it is originally titled Men Who Hate Women, is one of the best contemporary thrillers I have seen in a while. It combines a suspenseful plot and brutal violence with a deep exploration of its title character. It goes beyond its plot, revolving around a missing persons investigation, to become an at times disturbing character study.Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace are essential to the film's success. Both actors inhabit their roles convincingly, making us care about people who could have been stock characters. Although the bulk of praise has gone to Rapace, Nyqvist's performance is also worth attention. As Blomkvist, he provides a stable counterpart to Rapace's impulsive Lisabeth Salander, at times coming across as the more sympathetic character.Much has been made of the level of graphic violence, particularly sexual violence, in this film. Although this may be off-putting to some viewers, it helps establish one of the film's most important themes: the impact of violence on its victims and its capacity to warp the human personality. The most graphic scenes, which come early in the film, help establish this theme, and play an important role in characterization as well.Hopefully, this film will be remembered at Oscar time. It is far better than most of the dreck that Hollywood has on offer.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Scandinavian thrills,"It is a quite uncommon event, that a Swedish film should get so much attention pretty much anywhere, not just in Scandinavia or, outside its home regions, the art-house circuit (Bergman isn't exactly multiplex stuff). Of course, when the film in question is based on a best-selling novel, nay, the most profitable book in Northern Europe, it's a whole different thing: partly because of the unique circumstances surrounding its inception (the author was a journalist who wrote fiction just for fun and died shortly after submitting the final version of the manuscripts), Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy has shocked and enthralled readers all over the world, which explains why the adaptation of the first chapter, Men Who Hate Women (retitled The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo in English-speaking countries), has become the most successful Swedish movie of all time. That, and the fact that it's a very good film.Not surprisingly, the main character is, like the late author, an investigative reporter, a man in his late forties named Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist). Sentenced to a six-month stint in prison for allegedly forging evidence against a powerful businessman he wrote about in the magazine Millennium (hence the trilogy's title), he still has the time to carry out an assignment handed to him by one Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube): to find out what happened on the day Vanger's niece, Harriet, disappeared. Dis she simply vanish, or was she murdered? As the plot thickens, Mikael receives unexpected help from Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace), a young hacker with a troubled past and continued problems with her legal status, more specifically her sleazy guardian.In the transition from page to screen, some elements had to be abandoned, obviously: gone are the data on abused women that opened each section of the book (the major contribution of Larsson's journalistic side), as well as the sly references to past detective story staples (Blomkvist and Vanger mention Agatha Christie when discussing their investigation). In terms of plot, on the other hand, the adaptation process is worthy of L.A. Confidential: no unnecessary subplots (do we really need to see Mikael sleeping with half the women he encounters?) or irrelevant side characters, just Blomkvist and Salander, an odd investigative couple whose essence is best summed up by Mikael's line: ""You know everything about me, and I don't know sh*t about you."". It's that kind of weird humor, spoken in plain, brutal Swedish, that gives the film its heart, along with a decent dose of mystery.The Scandinavian landscape has its part in guaranteeing the story's success, too: like in the wonderful Let the Right One In, the cold, snowy environment provides the ideal backdrop for one of the most chilling (pun not intended) and grisly tales of murder ever committed to film. Staying true to the book's bleak core, the violence is depicted without many restrictions, especially in the central rape scene that justifies the original Swedish title and sets The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo aside from the majority of Hollywood's sanitized thrillers.In short, this is a riveting, rewarding experience. Needless to say, an American version is already in the works to please subtitle-weary moviegoers. It's not necessarily a bad idea (look at what Chris Nolan did with Insomnia, originally a Norwegian picture), but can there really be a Tinseltown actress brave - and good - enough to take over from the mesmerizing Noomi Rapace? Well, at least she still has two more films to steal before that happens...8,5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Competently made but rather average thriller,"I went to see this based on the trailer, which gave me a totally wrong impression of it, as does the American distribution title. The ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is really a rather subsidiary character and frankly not very interesting. What this is really about is an uninspired murder mystery, and the real protagonist is yet another investigative journalist, and not one with a whole lot of personality. The actress who plays the titular ""girl"" makes a pretty sincere effort to turn an unbelievable fantasy into a real person, but I've seen all the relevant clichés rehashed too many times to have much interest in seeing them again. The ""magic hacker"" trope is relied upon heavily but is never executed very credibly. Once again, we're expected to believe that any kind of data can be downloaded from anywhere as long as you wear something cool enough while you're tapping randomly on the keyboard. It's not a bad movie, but it's nothing special and will mainly appeal to people who have already bought into the whole murder-mystery pot-boiler genre.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Nice piece of work,"My low regards for Swedish film industry aside, this is a really well crafted movie. Director Oplev apparently knows the ropes enough to make the Swedish crew seem plausible. The old school with SB Taube and Hirdwall usually deliver good characters, and Nyqvist as well. The younger talent strikes me as a bit more stiff usually and deliver dialogs as they read directly from the script. Not here. The only one that I find off, is actually Lena Endre. Not that she is bad, but she is just as we always see her. Music-wise, a big step in the right direction. I think of Howard Shore scores from Seven and Silence of the lambs. Too bad that the movie sound, the dialog in particular, doesn't hold the same standard. Also, not to give anything away, in the final scenes- bear in mind Bourne Ultimatum last scenes, and Silence of the lambs final. In short, hats of to this magnificent film. This is the proof that you don't necessarily make a good flick just on million dollar budgets as in Arn(lame), but with the right talent. In this case I salute director Oplev.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A disappointment for those who have read the book,"I was really surprised that this movie got an average 7,8/10 from more than ten thousand viewers, many of whom must have read the book.I cannot decide if it is due to the fact that I have read the book and liked it very much. Or to the Swedish acting style (I can reject this theory because I have already seen excellent Swedish films. Older ones and recent ones).But, people, this movie sucks.a) Acting is superficial and wooden. The only one who tries to do something, but finally does not succeed, because the others don't help, is Noomi Rapace.b) The story advances hastily, trying to fit 550 pages into two hours and something. It gives you the feeling that it develops unnaturally and the impression that the filmmaker just took the scenes from the book one by one and ""translated"" them into film, without caring to connect them in a cinematic way. The language of cinema is completely different. If you don't know the rules, better don't do it.c) There have been important changes in the story, but they really don't make things better. But don't worry, Sex and Violence scenes are all there, nothing is missing!d) The technical part (photography,atmosphere, music) is well executed.

"Noomi Rapace great discovery, terrific dreadfulness",Mikael Blomkvist is the publisher of Millennium magazine. He loses a libel case brought by billionaire financier Hans-Erik Wennerström. He is setup and found guilty. He is sentenced to three months and a large fine. Lisbeth Salander is a skilled hacker hired to follow him by Henrik Vanger. Henrik is the patriarch of an old wealthy family. He wants to hire Blomkvist to investigate the disappearance of his niece Harriet who vanished in 1966. He believes that she was killed by a family member but her body was never found. Blomkvist's father used to work for the family and he visited them as a child. Lisbeth is given a new creepy guardian.It is dark. It is as complicated as any murder mystery. It is disturbingly graphic and Noomi Rapace's performance is gripping.

Awesome,"Saw this unfortunately in the English dubbed version. But, that actually did not detract from the fact it's an awesome movie. What a story and so well played. If you don't know the story it will keep you entertained from start till finish (and then 2 more movies to see on the same level). Although not a massively exciting story it seems at first glance it develops so well. Well acted I think. The dubbed version they could have used better voices but you can see the intensity of the filming in the acting. Swedish police series are often very good, they are realistic. It's not about cars flying through the air and guns blazing cops. It's the human story behind it that matters, this could have happened in real life!

It definitely has a ""girl power"" feel to it but it is very well done. The acting is excellent the storyline is excellent and its well written.One thing I really loved was its not your typical ""American"" , which its not, suspense/detective movie. A lot of these are clues and discoveries that come out of nowhere and don't make a lot of sense. This movie I found was very realistic in the way it was written and was done the way real people would do it. It didn't have that feeling of disconnection with the characters being so much more intelligent and magical when it came to the clues.Anyway I enjoyed it so much Im going to give the other movies a shot with the same female character.I highly recommend this but please be aware, there is A lot of ""violation"" if you will.

"Suspenseful, Intriguing! What movies should be about!","This film is not for children or squeamish adults. This film has shocking moments like Lisbeth's relationship with her appointed guardian for instance. I won't spoil the circumstances but it's worth noticing Lisbeth's sense of justice throughout the film. Without knowing it, she is following Michael Blomquist, a disgraced journalist with prison time for libel. Anyway, he has six months so he takes a leave and is hired to find out about the disappearance of Harriet Vanger. The Vanger family is one of the wealthiest in the country but they have their share of secrets. Anyway, the story slowly unravels at a decent pace. I haven't read the books but I was interested in seeing the Swedish film over the American version of the same story. Maybe it's because I think Sweden has a great cast in this film. The actress who plays Lisbeth Salander is fantastic in this role. She was plays Lisbeth in the trilogy. I can't wait to see those films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Well-crafted mystery, but Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander is the best reason to see this.","My wife is a constant reader and she spoke highly of the trilogy of novels, the first being the book this movie was made from. So now we are in the process of watching all three, which were apparently all filmed in succession over about 18 months. We watched with the dubbed English sound track. The dubbing is done very well, fairly closely matching the mouth movements.Michael Nyqvist is Mikael Blomkvist, investigative journalist who writes an expose' but appears to have been set up. His source materials either disappear or appear to be fakes, and is ultimately convicted of slander and scheduled to spend several months in jail.Meanwhile Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander, a very unusual 24-yr-old, short haircut, multiple piercings, and always in black, crosses Mikael's path. She is an expert computer hacker and insightful investigator on her own, and digs into his life. What she finds is that he in fact is innocent, an honest man. They eventually work together to solve a 40-yr-old mystery.The mystery is the disappearance of Harriet Vanger, only 16, and since then presumed murdered. This happened in the 1960s, but a body was never found. The elder Vanger patriarch wants Mikael to investigate and solve the mystery. He believes one of the Vanger family members, which includes several Nazi sympathizers, must be the guilty party.During this first movie we also get a glimpse of Lisbeth's past, which included a stay in a mental facility, and an overseer who abused her. We also see the video she made secretly, which is destined to show up again in the other movies.All the characters are good, but I can't say enough about Rapace as Lisbeth. She creates a character as memorable as any. More closely akin to Nikita than anything else. This DVD has a 12 minute interview with her, in English. I am glad I saw the movie first, because Rapace in real life looks and acts nothing like Lisbeth. She made quite a transformation for the role.Good movie, even though it is long at around 2 1/2 hours, I was always anxious for the next scene, the next development. Now I am interested in what the American remake will be, but I can't imagine that it will be as good as this one.November 2019 edit: I just rewatched it, much of it seemed very fresh, I enjoyed it as much after 8+ years dormancy. Don't read the last paragraph below if you want to avoid spoilers.SPOILERS follow, you may want to quit reading at this point: As the investigation into Harriet moved along, using old information and old negatives from the 1960s, plus notations in the back of Harriet's bible, Lisbeth figured out the notations referenced bible verses. This led to the realization that the murdered people were Jewish. Eventually this led to one of the Vanger men, and then figuring out that Harriet had fled before she too became a victim. They located her in Australia, brought her home for the reunion with her elderly uncle who was looking for closure before he died.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Disappointing,"The hype around this book - and hence the movie - is quite huge, especially in the Nordic countries. Personally I have not read the book, but I must admit that I had quite the high expectations for this picture.It really manages to keep the interest level up all through the movie, but although it fails to bore me I cannot help but feeling that it could have been made better. First of all, I think that it really is easy to predict the storyline while seeing. For the observant viewer this may turn out as a moment of irritation; especially when the dialogue seems to reveal the progression before the viewer gets to independently think or even make up his/her mind. In other words, I think the creators underestimates the viewer (or perhaps are targeting a larger amount of viewers).Second, I really don't see what the big fuzz around the story is! Well, as I told, I haven't read the book, but the story presented in the picture is not that original and interesting that I thought. But that's my opinion, because I think the extremes aren't shocking enough compared to what is needed in todays media world.Thirdly, I also think there are too many clichés and shortcuts in the plot.On the positive record, there are some very good scenes, and the main actors are doing a good performance. Not extraordinary, but surely good acting. This, accompanied with the tensity the movie maintains throughout I'll give this a rating of 6,5 of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Remarkable.,"I certainly must not have been the only one to discover this film via it's American ""twin brother"". I did not read the book to judge how the adaptation did it justice, but I have faith that it would have been excellent. Skillfully directed by Neil Arden Oplev, this Swedish film was also my first contact with Scandinavian cinema.I do not know if it's worthwhile to dwell on the plot, which begins with the investigation of a disappearance in a very rich and powerful family to give rise to a tense and appealing story of mystery surrounding a murderer of women. It is a dense film, with a lot of tension and characters full of personality and easy to like. Of course, the leading role goes entirely to the unfortunate journalist Mikael Blomkvist and his occasional collaborator Lisbeth Salander, a punk hacker with a past of violence and delinquency. The film knows perfectly how to build a tense and mysterious environment, and play with it to keep the audience watching.The cast has several names in Swedish cinema that are naturally unknown to me because I am far from being a minimal connoisseur of this cinematic universe. Anyway, I really liked Michael Nyqvist's performance, but the extraordinary Noomi Rapace steals all the attention whenever she appears. She is truly talented and has grasped her character with determination, willing to show value. And so it was!Technically, I would like to highlight the excellent quality of cinematography and the work of filming and editing. The film is long, almost three hours long and in some versions (perhaps the most dedicated to TV) it appears divided in two halves ... but it is totally worth it and if the audience is carried away, they will not even feel the time passing. The effects are minimal, but they fulfill their role, the dialogues are excellent and the lines work very well. The sets and costumes, as well as the Swedish landscapes (with or without snow) increase the visual beauty of the whole ensemble. The soundtrack does its job well.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Lisbeth is a very interesting and intelligent girl, which I think you don't quite get in the movie.In some scenes the acting of Noomi Rapace is brilliant, as well as Peter Andersson, and the chemistry between them is really uncomfortable.But I must recommend the film, and I'm eager to see the 2 following movies based on the books 2 and 3 (if they will be made).",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Deeply disturbing content not worth enduring for minor dramatic payoff,"'Girl' exposes us to brutal behaviors and images, serving up a revolting stew of behaviors (sexual, political, religious/ethnic violence and just plain sadism) in the service of a simple, improbable love story between an avenging Goth girl and a crusading journalist with writer's block, organized in the form of a whodunnit. The book was probably great. The movie is grisly. The actress at the center gives a game performance, but the movie never earns the right to display its endless disturbing examples of destructive human behavior by illuminating their origins or consequences in any discernible way. So it becomes, unfortunately, a kind of soft-core snuff film disguised as a suspense drama.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
One of the better thrillers,"My brother and I were late for this movie, so we only got to see the audience when the lights went back on. I'd describe it as above 50. The reason is probably that this is not your average Hollywood murder movie.It has most of the elements that thrillers of this kind have. Clue by clue you are lead to the murderer, but the answer is only revealed at the end. Where is movie differs from most common thrillers is that characters are described more realistically, without certain bounds that most movies seem to have. This adds to the intensity of 'Men who hate women'.This intense detective has some interesting twists, and should be quite enjoyable for most adults.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Goodbye Ingmar Bergman, Hello Raymond Chandler","I've always been cautious about seeing Swedish films made in the last 30-40 years. The reason is that--unlike America, Britain, Germany, China, Mexico, Italy or Australia--there is almost no controversy over who is Sweden's greatest filmmaker. And thus nearly every Swedish film I've ever seen not directed by Ingmar Bergman has either been a rip-off of the great man's work or just shallow trash. (Substitute ""Kurosawa"" for ""Bergman"" and you'll know why I also tend to avoid Japanese cinema). Nonetheless, I kept hearing about this film and the book that inspired it. As a lover of mystery novels and film noir, I decided that I need to at least give this movie a chance. And I'm glad I did. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" owes almost nothing to Bergman and everything to the novels of Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett and Ross McDonald.It begins when a sickly, elderly billionaire industrialist who knows better than to trust his awful family wants to investigate the 42-year-old disappearance of his niece--the only relative he ever loved (think ""The Big Sleep""). Through intermediaries, he hires Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace)--a hacker/private investigator with a troubled past and a large dragon tattoo on her back. Her assignment is to vet disgraced leftist journalist Mikael Blomqvist (Michael Nyqvist) to see if he's up to the job. Eventually Blomqvist agrees to do the job and quickly realizes that he needs Lisbeth to help him. Revealing much more of the plot would be unfair.Aside from the serpentine plot (involving Nazis, serial killers, and a clandestine romance), the thing I liked most about this movie was Rapace's performance as the inscrutable Lisbeth. Maybe there's a pattern here, or maybe it's just me, but--along with Kristen Stewart in ""The Runaways""--my two favorite female performances of 2010 thus far have been portrayals of angry, leather-jacketed bisexual young women. Without changing facial expressions, Rapace is somehow able to show anger, fear, love, sadness and embarrassment at the appropriate times. And I feel the scene where Lisbeth is raped by her parole officer ranks just as high if not higher than the scene in ""The Accused"" that won Jodie Foster her first Oscar.According to this site, there is already an American remake in the works. I don't know how that's going to work. Parts of the plot are fairly Euro-centric (i.e. jail-time for libel, a local Nazi movement run by Hitler himself). Plus, the film retains novelist Stieg Larsson's radical anti-capitalist, anti-government views, which most Americans would find unpalatable.The future of Swedish cinema rests on movies from that country being watchable without giving up their artistic merit. Swedish filmmakers need to step outside the notion of becoming ""the next Bergman"" because there will only ever be one Bergman. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is a great first step along that path.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Brilliant,"This is the way Hollywood should learn to balance the suspense of a thriller and the character of a good drama. The chemistry between the two leads and their ability to convey the complexities of their relationship are a huge draw when watching this movie.The girl is complex, and this first movie in the trilogy only gives a glimpse of her back story - a violent young woman, who at 24 years old is still saddled with a guardian who wants to oversee her money and all her activities. Even though she is the title character, the investigator/journalist who crosses paths with her is really the driving persona in the story. We follow him into a murder mystery, where her story is only a backdrop to her character and her motivation for helping the investigation.The murder mystery itself is just as compelling as it begins to take the lead. While the structure of setting up such complex characters before getting into the main storyline is a little foreign to the American audience, it's necessary for a story with such characters and it's handled seamlessly here. The story never loses its drive, and its climax touching on issues of race dynamics, twisted psychologies and dysfunctional families, is worth every moment of the film's buildup.And the second movie in the trilogy is even better!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Tattooed Mist,"Somewhere along the way, the detective genre in both books and movies has drifted. In the formative period where the form was strong enough to stick, the idea was a to create an engaging puzzle. The narrative was the thing and the game was to sort out the causal agency among possibilities in a sort of quantum logic. Other than the recurring detective, characters and settings were there to color the puzzle. In fact, filling them out would reveal their inner motivations, and that had to be kept hidden.Then I suppose in the late 70s, detective fiction became what the publicists called ""psychological."" The genre bumped up against the procedural. Readers lost the desires and skills required to play the simple game, so the game evolved into what I call a vocabulary of folding devices. In the process, detective storytelling started getting judged by the same rules as ordinary drama, for better or worse.Those rules may overemphasize character definition. We have to have an absurdly sharp but easily described set of ghosts that haunt every character that matters. Mix that with Lutheran Swedish filmmaking and you end up with something like this. The mood is refined and disturbing. The camera does not probe because we expect the characters to project to us. People are damaged, seriously damaged and they spread it around themselves. Cold is the same as gloom.I have not read the book. It is possible that the language used there is able to bridge the inner cosmos of our two detectives and the world they are discovering. Surely the matter is the same: sexual violence. (Blomkvist's situation here is not quite clear; a lover at work may have helped frame him.)Anyway, you get two movies. Visually and tone-wise you have the heavy Bergman. There is no mystery or coherent story outside the characters. The characters are cartoons, so outside our experience that they cannot connect, only display.The only engaging things were the stories within: the photos primarily.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"Well, It could be better","The book Men Who Hate Women (Original Book Title) was popular even before the film, but to be honest first time I heard of it from the film itself. Before I watch the movie, I decide to read the book first.I get the book read a whole book, and I really love it. Then I get the DVD, watch it, and for me I could be much better.The casting, well it couldn't be better, everyone play the part well especially Noomi Rapace as Salander, really portray the salander in the novel, and other actor well, good acting.The story, if you haven't read the book sure you will enjoy it.. but for me since I read the book first, I didn't enjoy it much (but it still good). The storyline is different, the story flow is different, not much but you could see the different.When the story based on the book, there is two kind, one is based on the book thoroughly and second one based on the book but change a bit in term of storyline, and this movie is the later one.When you change the storyline, it could be better, or less.. this film I enjoy much more the novel storyline.I think the reason why the story is different because of the title. The book is Men Who Hate Women, than change to The Girl With Dragon Tattoo, the book not focus on telling story about Salander, it much more about the cruelty of some Men, but when the title is The Girl With Dragon Tattoo, like it or not, it need focus more on Salander hence the new story line.The kill some characters, maybe downsizing the casting members.I heard about Hollywood gonna remake the movie, in English of course, one think I hope it based on the novel and not based on this movie.Even so this movie still fun to watch, and need to start reading The Girl Who Played with Fire before get the DVD.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Disappointing,"I can not understand how anybody can give this a good review having read the book. The major flaw in the film is that it is really poorly cast. Noomi Rapace just doesn't have the screen presence, acting ability or really fit the profile of Lisbeth Salander. Michael Nyqvist also gives a poor performance as Mikael Blomkvist.This film fails miserably to capture any of the suspense and drama of the book and ends up like a ""B"" movie you'd expect to see on day time t.v.I was really looking forward to seeing this movie and am now just amazed that someone gave the go ahead for Niels Arden Oplev to ruin such a good story.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Excellent in all areas of filmmaking,"Without having read the book at the time of watching this incredible movie, I found it very stunning. The movie grips you from the beginning and doesn't disappoint as it moves through a complicated story. The movie doesn't shy away from graphically explaining the elements and harshness of the stories many plot lines from intersecting in a twist of movie making greatness. Noomi plays Lisbeth so close to the book that you think Steig wrote her character with Rapace in mind all the way. The best part of the movie is that you can then move right into the sequels without having to wait. Thankfully, the Swedish makers didn't wait in between films and released all three in the same year, 2009. The makers of the movie also did not dilute the movie or 'dumb it down'. It's an excellent movie based on some very disturbing themes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
See for Lisbeth Salander alone.,"Based on the novel of the same name, this film follows three characters as they intersect each other's lives. Mikael Blomkvist (Nyqvist) is a journalist who has just been sentenced to three months in prison after claims of libel from a corrupt business tycoon. Blomkvist believes he has been set up but nothing helps his case. He is given six months to handle his affairs before being locked away. Henrik Vanger is an elderly man who receives framed, dead flowers once a year from an unknown source. The flowers used to come from his niece who disappeared forty years ago and Henrik believes she is dead. He has never given up hope on finding her and hires Blomkvist to look into her disappearance to give him piece of mind, especially since he still receives the flowers. Blomkvist accepts this last job before he goes inside.Next we introduce the most intriguing movie character I have ever seen, Lisbeth Salander. A socially inept lesbian with short hair, nose, ear and lip piercings and tattoos draped across her back and arms. She is the girl of the title. She is introduced as a researcher who is secretly photographing Blomkvist during his trial. Also being an expert computer hacker she is hacking into his computer so she can see what he sees. After having a troubled up bringing she is left in the care of a guardian, with her Mother in a hospital. Her new guardian however attempts to blackmail her for sexual favours, before savagely raping her, something she manages to film and gain revenge on by tattooing this man's chest. These scenes are some of the most harrowing I have seen and expertly filmed.During his investigation, Blomkvist is sent an email from Lisbeth which helps him with the clue he is struggling to solve. After this he recruits her to aid in his investigation. This is where the film really gets its wheels. From here on in we dive into a world of family conspiracy, incest and rape and the battle of vulnerable women against controlling men. I did not realise that this is what this film was about. Those of you who have read the book will but those who haven't will get a bit of a shock.I have to say I struggled to get into the beginning of this film. Many have told me that to enjoy the book you have to persist with the first fifty pages and once you do the book gets a hold of you. I felt this was definitely the case with the film also. It took a while for it to get going and considering it is subtitled I found myself becoming a little switched off. However I'm glad I didn't as once I had got past that section I was gripped. When Blomkvist and Salander finally meet, the film really gets going. Before that seems too long and at that point of the film I thought that too but now I have finished it I realise how important it was in giving insight into the characters, especially Lisbeth.The plot of the film is nothing to shout about but where the film really grips you is the characters. OK maybe not characters but character. Blomkvist is a little dull and not your typical hero and considering the title of the film, I was surprised to see him be the main character. Lisbeth on the other hand is intriguing. I want to know more about her, even know. Very little is told and the character alone keeps you hooked on the film. She is bigger than the entire plot and she makes you take notice whenever she is on screen. Noomi Rapace is fantastic as her and even manages to give a Gothic woman covered in piercings and tattoos a very sexy edge. The chemistry between the leads is great and the relationship is not clichéd in the slightest.I don't want to say too much about this film as it is one you really have to see. Get past the first twenty minutes and the subtitles and enjoy the characters on that screen. Lisbeth Salander is fascinating. She is to be played by Kate Mara in the American remake and she has a hell of a pair of shoes to fill. There is so much to enjoy in this movie and 'she' is a character you will all enjoy watching.The film is definitely for adults only with scenes of violence, rape and bondage but the excellent direction and cinematography handles it all tastefully although they are a little harrowing. The performances in these scenes are just fantastic. I can't state this enough: go and watch this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Well done!,"I thought this movie was a well done adaptation of the book! The way I had imagined the characters, buildings, countryside, offices etc while reading all were very similar to how they were portrayed in the movie. However, I'm wondering how much I would have liked it had I NOT read the books. I feel that movie adaptations often leave out a lot of ""back-story"" and when you add that to having to read subtitles (which seemed very basic) - I really felt I knew more about the story than those who never read the books. I'm not sure if that makes sense, I just think I enjoyed the subtitled movie more because I had read the books. This movie is NOT for kids, or for watching on your iPad on the plane! Some very disturbing scenes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
This is how a thriller should be done.,"My wife rented this one from our local library. I remembered reading Roger Ebert's review of the sequel ""The Girl Who Played with Fire"" and being intrigued by this one. I personally am a huge fan of foreign films having seen entries from Mexico, Japan, Germany, Spain Italy and China but other than Bergman's ""Fanny and Alexander"" I was unfamiliar with Swedish cinema. I think it is the best film I have seen this year, a Swedish ""The Silence of the lambs"". It is much darker than anything Hollywood puts out but to European audiences the graphic violence and nudity i'm sure is fairly routine. The two leads Michael Nyqvist and especially Noomi Rapace are brilliant with Rapace especially deserving mention. Her Lisbeth Salander is the year's most nuanced female performance. When she is on screen you cannot take your eyes off her. Hollywood is already planning a remake of this to be directed by David Fincher. It can't top this one and no other actress on the planet can play Lisbeth after Noomi Rapace. If you can handle the subtitles and the graphic violence plus the 2 hour and 25 minute run time you won't see a more compelling piece of cinema this year.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Disturbing Swedish thriller,"I watched this after seeing Catwoman, however while that is a piece of meaningless fluff, this purports to be something with more serious intent. The trouble is, I don't find Lisbeth Salander much more credible than Catwonan. She seems to be just about as indestructible. The basic story involves a journalist who is asked by an aging industrialist to investigate the disappearance of his niece some forty years ago. However, the investigation throws up something much darker - that there has been a serial killer who is in some way involved. The disappearance of the girl is a kind of locked room mystery, or rather an island cut off from the mainland by a blocked bridge. The film basically follows the plot of the book, with just a few changes which seem to be to fit it into the film's running time, although it still runs for two and a half hours. Does it work? On the whole I think it does, if you can accept the more improbable aspects of the plot, and credit must be given to Noomi Rapace for her portrayal of Lisbeth Salander. I found the film to be alternately gripping and repellant. I found myself wondering whether the film was condemning violence against women, or exploiting it. It seem to be a thin line there, which the film occasionally strays to the wrong side of. So a good effort, but flawed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

The exception is the Lisbeth character but the portrait of her insists on her being so mystique that she ends up being an impersonal caricature.The conclusion is that the movie is a standard Scandinavian socio-thriller very suitable for a 1 1/2 hour TV-show in the style of Beck or Wallander. As a cinematic movie it's mediocre - to long, to full of clichés, character building to flat & impersonal and the plot to predicable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo""","""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is hardly what I expected from the highest grossing Swedish film of all time. Maybe it's the graphic rape, I don't know—I was expecting something more commercial. The good news is that in such moments, ""Dragon Tattoo"" is disquietingly powerful. The bad news is that they lie few and far between an otherwise mediocre mystery. Swedish actress Noomi Repace plays the eponymous lead, Lisbeth Salander, and brims with a badassery on par with Franka Potente of ""Run Lola Run."" She's terrific, but let me say this up front—The character and her performance are better than the film (or at least its second half) deserves.The first seventy-five minutes impressively juggle gritty, squeamish scenes of Lisbeth's abuse at the hands of her slimy probate and her subsequent revenge, with a straightforward, slow-paced thriller involving Mikeal Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist), a journalist convicted of libel, being privately hired to shed light on a long cold family kidnapping case. The two threads are remarkably dissimilar in theme and style, and it's a peanut butter and jelly situation for the film; they complement each other ideally, preventing the other from becoming tiresome.But as should be expected from a story with simultaneously unraveling plot lines, we soon reach their intersection, and although it's a matter of personal preference, for me ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" flounders once its characters coalesce. For starters, Lisbeth's infinitely more interesting arc (and consequently, its stylish flourish) is swallowed by Mikeal's when she becomes his investigatory partner midway through the film. The 'straightforward, slow-paced thriller' takes hold, with the odd addition of a buddy cop dynamic. Generations collide! Lisbeth understands computers and Mikeal has antiquated taste in music!It's a weird turn, and one I don't think ""Dragon Tattoo"" really recovers from. The character of Lisbeth is far and away its highlight, and if anything, as the film progresses, her role becomes increasingly marginalized. She loses the snap and snarl that she has independently as she and Mikeal inevitably get intimate, and maybe for some, watching the two change each other as the case comes into focus will be the emotional apex, but I found it a disappointing detour. Lisbeth's act of unflinching vengeance early in the film is neither topped nor matched—She becomes more boring in Mikeal's presence.Maybe it's that a relationship in general doesn't feel convincing for so scarred a character. Certainly this is the implication of Lisbeth's interest in sex above intimacy, but it feels like a requisite development dictated by genre expectation rather than an organic attraction between the two characters. That she uses sexuality as a vehicle for self-empowerment is an interesting angle, but then I don't buy the legitimate affection later on. Lisbeth has a photographic memory and is haunted by her past—She isn't the sort of person whom I believe has a dormant tenderness.""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is long, and by the end of the engagement, I felt exactly what the dual story lines prevented me from feeling: tired. The wrinkles in the mystery aren't especially surprising, and the plot is stretched to the point that I'm almost inclined to forget what I found initially so compelling about the characters because where it takes them is so much less so. Lisbeth is fiercely independent, and watching her emasculate her pervert probate has a gratifying brutality that seeing her play second fiddle in a PI procedural couldn't hope to.My mixed feelings about the film make it difficult to consolidate a final score, so I'll leave it here: ""Dragon Tattoo"" is a film I half-liked.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A pair of amazing performances and a circuitous whodunnit,"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2009)An ambitious, complex (at first), offbeat Swedish thriller. There are some really refreshing aspects, not the least is the two main characters, who are not the stereotypes that American (and British) movies seem to be trapped into. That is, these two are really interesting, and driven to succeed, and not just pretty or suave or sexualized. So we focus on the plot for its own sake, and the characters for theirs, avoiding at least some of the threadbare clichés of this kind of step by step detective/conspiracy thriller.At first the story will seem overly convoluted, but it's nice to remember those certain movies where you have to trust the story to explain itself over time, which it does. Movies that don't dumb down, which this one doesn't. There are, unfortunately, some apparently necessary familiarities with uncovering a crime, like photos that get blown up to reveal new details, and tie-ins with mythic or medieval sources (in this case, an old Bible). And the mistreatment of women. There is also a sense that the perpetrator, since he or she isn't known to the viewer, is a bit abstract, and not, until the end, a threat.This throws our attention on the quest for information, and on the two leads. The idealistic reporter, played by Michael Myquist, and the counter culture corporate spy, a young woman with piercings and a troubled past, played by Noomi Rapace, are absolutely first rate. They underplay their rather juicy parts. Admiration goes especially for Rapace, who could have hammed this up terribly, or just cheapened her role, but she does a prize-winning twist on all that, and you come to like her more and more as it goes.The last two minutes? Boy I hated that. It's as if a certain honesty and love of pure truth and justice is thrown out the window for glitz and artifice. But wow, the two and a half hours up to that point are riveting, wonderful stuff. And American viewers should know that this is just the first third of a trilogy, already filmed and released in Sweden, so there's still a wild, intelligent ride ahead.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Probably the best thriller of the year but it will not be released in USA,"Millennium 1, The Man Who Hate Women is a thriller; but most of all a character study.

It is sad because dumb things like I LOVE YOU MAN, DUPLICITY, THE HANGOVER or any romantic or formulaic movie gets wide release and huge publicity while this master piece; based on a master piece book will be limited to a DVD by the few people with still some cultural knowledge in the country.

An excellent adaptation,"The Millennium Trilogy has become a publishing sensation, selling millions of around the world and made its author Stieg Larsson a household name after his death. A film adaptation was always going to be in high demand and the Swedish version is to make a feature film of the first novel and TV adaptation of the other two novels and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is one of the most successful Swedish films to date.Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) is a journalist who has been sued for libel and sentenced to three months in prison. With his reputation in tatters a major industrialist, Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube) hires him to investigate an old mystery, the disappearance of 16-year-old great-niece Harriet (Julia Sporre). What makes the mystery even deeper is that it happened on an island that had no access to the mainland, no body was ever found and the Vanger family is distrustful, hateful bunch, so murder seems likes the only explanation. Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) is a skilled private investigator and a computer hacker and she has a very dark and troubled pass. A sadistic lawyer, Nils Bjurman (Peter Andersson) has control over her finances and Lisbeth has to find a way to neutralise him. Both Blomkvist and Salander are brought together and investigate what happen to Harriet, finding that something much bigger has been going on.The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is a great novel, a real page turner making the reader really wanting to find out what happens next. Niels Arden Oplev and his writing team really a really great job at adapting the novel. If you are a complete purist you will never be happy with film adaptation but The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo does not cut much out, only a few subplots and change a few elements to avoid the film being over loaded with characters. The only changes that really cause any problems are the offer to Blomkvist for him to take what is a seemingly thankless job, his relationship of his daughter and his distrust of religion and some elements involving the business of Millennium which becomes important later in the series. But these are fairly minor and the film does a good job at getting round these issues.Oplev certainly made a stylist thriller and for a film that is 2 hours, 20 minutes long, he made sure that his adaptation was a tense, fast pace affair. Scenes of particular note are when Lisbeth are with Bjurman, where you could cut the tension with a knife because of the strong interplay by Rapace and Andersson and Oplev handling behind the camera. This is a dark moody film, filled with great acting throughout. The cast really fitted their roles being very much like their counterparts in the book. Anderson was particularly creepy as Bjurman and Rapace had a lot of fight in her as Lisbeth. Nyqvist made a really good Blomkvist and I want to see what The actors in the Hollywood version have a lot to live up to. Oplev made sure that his version is very hard hitting film but so is the book and Larrson did not hold back. Everything worked in this film, the music, the editing, the cinematography and art direction. It is a well made adaptation.One criticism I have of the books is that I find some of Larrson's characterisation of some of his villains. In The Girl in the Dragon Tattoo it was very complex and believable about how sadists, rapists and serial killers are like, but later on Larrson goes for big conspiracy theories about big business and Security Services and most of the bad guys are hate women, blaming them for all their problems. There is also Larrson's politics, pretty much everyone good is centre-left, no one is even mildly conservative and Larrson has a real disrespect for the centre-right. I have same problem with Tom Clancy who idealises Ronald Regan and most the Republican party and vigilantes and anyone who is a Democrat or a peace activist or supports anything the Republicans disagrees with is a someone who wants to hold back or destroy America and the West: rant over!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Noomi Rapace sensational in the lead role,Having read the Millenium trilogy I felt sure that no one could adequately portray on film the unique and complex character that is Lisbeth Salander.

Voyeuristic garbage posing as exposé of women haters,"This is just a kinky variation on a standard fare plodding murder mystery, the twist being that it uses some ""hip"" computer terms, images & concepts that don't look 15 years out of date the way most Hollywood movies do.Of course what turns on viewers here the most is the fairly graphic depiction of the brutalization of several women, along with some equally graphic revenge scenes, but no one will ever convince me that the presentation of these scenes is anything other than sheer commercial exploitation, pretty cynical at that since it's posing as a crusade against what it's exploiting. Hey, remember Somerset Maugham's ""Rain""? Well, better this than actually committing the crimes I guess, but what about the few nascent psychos out there that this stuff always reaches & tips into action?",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo: 7/10,"The film has gained its popularity since its domestic run in Sweden, adapted from the first book of Millennium Trilogy (the rest two, The Girl Who Played with Fire and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest were all released in 2009).As a crime thriller, the film's global success lies in its well-arranged hackling of all the clues and releases them slickly (a little bit predictable as well), however the main attribution is to introduce a new star Noomi Rapace into Hollywood, her appearance and performance are so coherent with the character, which I can hardly sense she is acting. Millennium Trilogy is Noomi's stepping stone to success, next year we will see her in the new Sherlock Homes film along with Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law.As a punk-look hacker, our heroin shows sheer feminism, the highlight arrives when she is inserting a dildo into the pervert's anus and tattoos him later. Actually the revenge is not men-offending, on the contrary, it gives me a lot of satisfaction to see the callous vengeance finally fulfilled.I am very much stroke by the murder cases here (especially a frigid location of Sweden), it seems that the cruelness and coldness of the nature surrounding is overspreading inside people as well, as for me, posing the excuse of the brutal crimes on the flimsy religious and sexual grounds is too unrealistic.The cinematography is another merit, at times I saw the snow scene against a mesmerizing sea-blue sky set off by the haunting score. I hear rumor says that the second and third feature is not as good as this one, I find it is a perfect ending I just stop here and wait for David Fincher's remake coming out next year, which certainly I am more interested.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Disgusting movie,"If reviewers think that a movie with a tedious (3 hours) story line made up primarily of a how to guide to sadomasochism, bondage and discipline, serial rape and serial murder is a great movie it makes me really sad. I would have walked out of the movie but I did not want to embarrass my friends who brought me to see it. The sex was simulated but the violence was very explicit. There were numerous scenes of torture as well. While many felt the movie was well acted and well directed I would also disagree. The motivations of the characters were very unclear. For the most part the only emotions people showed were hate and glee over causing others physical pain on the one hand and the screams of physical pain by the victims on the other. As a matter of fact the emotions people showed were closer to those seen in a psycho ward. However, I do think the reason there is so poor character development and motivation is due to bad acting and directing. I must admit I do not understand why people go to bull fights either just to see animals being tortured.Since I first posted this review, I have read the last two books of the Millennium Trilogy. They are masterpieces. I disagree quite emphatically with those who say the pictures follow the books. Stieg Larsson through his translator, carefully develops characters and the violence while it does occur is a minor part of the books. The most glaring difference is the nuance of the books. The books are spy, murder detective thrillers to be sure, but the underlying purpose of the books is to promote a scathing indictment of Swedish society after the cold war. Each volume tackles a different aspect of Swedish society. Human trafficking, internal secret police operations and corruption in the corporate world.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Dark thriller,"I saw this last month at the 2010 Palm Springs International Film Festival where it played to full theaters. The novel by Stieg Larsson from which this film was adapted is heavily stocked in large American bookstores and I would assume many who went to the screenings had read the novel. I had not read the book but I did talk with several who did and although they liked the novel better and felt it was too difficult to condense the book into a two and half hour movie they did like the on screen adaptation by Nikilaj Arcel and Ramus Heisterberg. Two and a half hours may seem long to some but this film keeps your interest throughout and even though it may seem slow at times I did like its pacing. directed by Niels Arden Oplev this is the story of Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Myqvist) who is a disgraced investigative journalist who is awaiting a prison sentence. He is hired by an aging tycoon Henrik Vander (Sven-Bertil Taube) to do what the police couldn't and solve the disappearance of his niece nearly 40 years before. He is aided by a goth computer hacker, Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) who is a genius at investigations herself. This unlikely combination takes on the unsavory Vander family that is filled with Nazi sympathizers. There are some disturbing violent scenes in this dark thriller that may not be suitable to some. Nyqvist, who seems to be in almost every Swedish movie made is kind of stiff in this role but Rapace is intriguing. Nice production design by Niels Sejer and music score from Jacob Groth. This will play in American art houses and expect an American remake. I would recommend it an give it an 8.0 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

The film is dark yet brightly shot and directed. The main characters of Lisbeth and Micke are really well acted and very believable. I like to be shocked and scared and this film provided on both counts. It has a fair amount of adult content and sexual violence but this is totally relevant to the story and nature of Lisbeth's character.

Good Film Verison of the Hit Novel,"Usually I like to read the book first before watching the movie. In this case, reading the book first made watching the movie easier, but also made the experience a bit disappointing.I liked the way the screenplay adapted the book onto the big screen. This movie ran for over two hours, so that most of the important events in the novel are all accounted for. There were some details which were altered for cinematic purposes, but that was also OK, since it fits right into the story without altering major plot points.In the book, more pages were spent on journalist Mikael Blomkvist, the movie, on the other hand, gives practically equal, or even more, time to Lisbeth Salander, the pale thin Gothic female computer hacker with a disturbed past, facial piercings and the dragon tattoo, who helps Blomkvist solve the mystery of Harriet Vanger, who disappeared more than 20 years ago. Actress Noomi Rapace portrays the titular character Lisbeth bravely and with conviction.I say I was also disappointed in a way that having read the book cannot make me a fair judge whether the movie was able to effectively build up the suspense into the revelation of what really happened. The movie, though not exactly how I imagined some things, is a very faithful retelling of the book's events, no surprises. I am thinking maybe I should watch the 2nd movie first before reading the 2nd book, and see how that goes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"Worth Seeing, Albeit Overlong","This movie is beautifully filmed and produced, with top notch performances (for the most part). The plot has enough twists to keep you interested and the characters are well defined and believable. It contains some gritty scenes that American movies lack for fear of offending, and these play well in context of the movie.At 2.5 hours it is way too long, however, and many superfluous scenes could have been cut. It nearly turns into two or three movies by the end, though it's satisfying enough despite suffering from slow pacing throughout much of the second act. The climax of Act II feels like it should be the end of the movie, but alas, the main premise has not yet been answered, so we march into Act III, which is a bit choppy and unpolished, though it does deliver an emotionally satisfying climax, contrasting with the action-filled climax of Act II. The resolution, so long in coming, stretches into multiple plot lines to cover all the bases and tie up loose ends, with a somewhat glaring ""hole"" that I cannot reveal without including a spoiler; but by this point you just want the movie to end and so don't care so much, as it's been a good-enough ride.Out of all the movies out there, this one is certainly better than overrated movies like Inception (no villain except Cobb's guilt, no danger because all action takes place in the dream state, and nothing at stake we care about!) and Avatar (dialog to rival the worst B movie ever made - Titanic deserved being #1, this movie doesn't deserve to be in the top 10!). While The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is by no means a perfect movie, it is worth seeing, which is more than I can say for some blockbusters.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Tantalising, engaging thriller...","""People always have secrets. It's just a matter of finding out what they are.""Forty years ago, Harriet Vanger disappeared from a family gathering on the island owned and inhabited by the powerful Vanger clan. Her body was never found, yet her uncle is convinced it was murder and that the killer is a member of his own tightly knit but dysfunctional family. He employs disgraced financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist and the tattooed, ruthless computer hacker Lisbeth Salander to investigate. But the Vanger's are a secretive clan, and Blomkvist and Salander are about to find out just how far they are prepared to go to protect themselves.Based on the immensely popular novel by Stieg Larsson, 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' is the first of three films based on Larsson's bestselling 'Millenium Trilogy'. At 2 hours and 32 minutes long, 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' is a tantalising, engaging crime thriller that doesn't let up until the credits roll.The film's score can be heard before a picture is even seen on screen and sets the tone for the entire movie. What can be heard is a soundtrack that is simultaneously foreboding whilst also creating a sense of urgency. The score continues in much of the same vein for the duration of the film, in that it manages to convey dual emotions, and is uniformly excellent.The casting of Noomi Rapace as the girl who has the dragon tattoo, Lisbeth Salander, was a stroke of brilliance. Though her character isolates herself and is unsociable, to say the least, Rapace has created an engaging, endearing, likable, piercing character, managing to convey subtle emotions and who holds your attention from the moment she walks on screen. There are no scenes in which Rapace shies away from the task at hand and she's a standout. Michael Nyqvist, with the lesser of the two lead roles, is likable but slightly overshadowed. However, he gives a perfectly acceptable performance. Between the two lead actors there's also a to-and-fro sort of chemistry that works on several levels.The movie's script is solid. At all times what's being said on screen is interesting and the need to fill every little moment with dialogue doesn't appear in this film. Instead, the script wisely leaves moments of silence which, when coupled with what's occurring on screen, creates a dynamic happening. The script manages to give clues without revealing too much, leaving the details of the final twist to be a shock.Overall, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is an absorbing film that's well worth watching, even if you don't particularly like foreign films.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Surprised and breathless.,"I'm from Brazil and I never heard anything about this story, nor the Millennium trilogy or anything about it till one day I was caught reading some news about David Fincher's new movie which is entirely based on the original 2009's Swedish movie based on Stieg Larsson's novel 'Men Who Hate Women' (Män som hatar kvinnor, 2005). From that moment on I looked for more information about it, read everything I could find and the more I was informed about, the more I was curious about.Finally I could have the possibility to get the entire original movie trilogy to watch before watching any American version that are set to be release, or even trailers. Today I've watched the first one and I'm breathless. It's one of the best investigation/crime movies I've seen. Its impressive, well constructed, edged plot is really intense. The characters are also edged, full of interesting psychological layers, completely out of what is usually created. The story is extremely well developed and all the parallel stories withing the main plot are tied amazingly, being easy to follow even with its complexity level. I mean, there are no unnecessary twists or red herrings that American movies usually have just to play with the audience, the main plot lead us to the subplots with no efforts because the effective screenplay and direction naturally hold our attention in a full-circle story, guiding us from a defined beginning thru a fully coherent and satisfying ending.The acting level is another top thing. Michael Nyqvist as Mikael Blomkvist and Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander are responsible for entire movie effectiveness, both are completely different from each other, but at the same time their chemistry is amazing and their relationship may be complex but understandable. At first impression Noomi Rapace's character may seems awkward and move with all of our inner prejudices, but then you're intensely touched by her past and story and her difficulties to adapt herself into a harsh world and that's when you finally realize once again that prejudice isn't the best judging tool for anything.Every single scene in the movie has its reason to happen and that is impressive and refreshing for those ones that are tired and so used to American movies filled with empty scenes. It's a movie with some disturbing images, but as I said before, it's effective and necessary for the development of the characters and also for the deepness of the story.Now I can understand David Fincher's reasons to make an American version of the trilogy, not because since Seven (1995) there wasn't so many interesting thriller movies, but because 'Män som hatar kvinnor' not only can be easily the best one since Seven but maybe better than Fincher's classic. But really, I can't understand the reasons for an American version when the original Swedish one is superb, with an extremely top notch production. So I hope Fincher doesn't overdo the elements that the original retained in the exact doses, but unfortunately we can expect an extremely cleaner version.After watching the first part of the Millennium trilogy, I'm much more excited to watch the other two parts.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo Is A Terrific Movie,"I first heard about the book several years ago and I didn't think I would like it. It just sounded crazy. But when I finally sat down with it I couldn't stop. It was absolutely gripping. It has been a few years since I have read it so I can't be real specific. I liked it so much that I couldn't put it down and bought the rest of the trilogy. They were all great but the second two wandered a bit after the gripping tension of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.

The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo And The Wrongfully Accused Journalist Are On A Roll To Find Answers,"Based on Stieg Larsson's popular novel, 'Män Som Hatar Kvinnor' (aka 'Girl With The Dragon Tattoo') is a thriller that engages and keeps the viewer at the edge of the seat. The execution is solid the cinematography captures the beauty and mystery of the Scandinavian landscape and showcases each frame, the score contributes and sound effect is brilliant. The editing is mostly slick but there are a few times when the film moves slowly.The film touches various issues from hacking to sexual abuse and discrimination against Jews post the Second World War. None of them are explored fully as this isn't an issue-based film but it adds to the mystery and the story has enough grit and the characters are well written enough to involve the viewer. There are many twists that support the story in uncovering the layers.The overall performances are good. Michael Nyqvist does a fine job as Blomkvist, the wrongfully accused journalist who encounters a second chance to do right. Noomi Rapace is the star of 'Män Som Hatar Kvinnor' as she is outstanding as she displays tremendous depth in a restrained performance.Having not read Larsson's popular novels, 'Män Som Hatar Kvinnor' succeeds as a stand alone thriller.

The man who liked the Wasp (dvd),"Noomi is such a great actress that she's the only one to make me break my promise of not buying anymore DVD as long as I haven't finished to watch all my collection. That's why I can review it now in the middle of my TV shows DVD.What i knew about ""Millenium"" was nothing but it reached my radar by a past colleague who has read the books. I remember also to see the poster in the subway and it made me think about the singer of the group rock Indochine. But, it's only with ""Prometheus"" that I have discovered Noomi as a very promising young actress.Thus, she gave me a ticket for a noir trip in Sweden and it's good. Living in the so-called European Union, i have always wondered why in France, we never have the movies from our cousins. Thus, it's a miracle to have a Swedish blockbuster, all the more than in our all-visual society, it's again a book that has started it.Going to Stockholm was a come-back for me because i used to visit a friend there and i think i have been in a few locations. In all cases, the movie is a fine production with beautiful landscapes and great insight about Swedish way of life. The investigation is interesting because it mixes old past with brand new technology and if you pay attention, you can understand what happens, which is not the case in a lot of movies. Sure, some moments are a bit flat (the abuse, the family reaction, the pursuit, the flowers gifts) but at last, the tension and the mystery is ever present.About the cast, this Swedish team is excellent and proves that there's a life outside Hollywood, which is paradoxically what Noomi is actually seeking. There, she was perfectly cast because as i have seen in ""Prometheus"", she exudes an inner rage, a survival instinct, a raw sensibility that made me think to the young De Niro. This wasp character is also interesting to discover because she isn't really into talks. You really have to be patient to reach her and as the film ends, you really want to follow this strange couple into their next adventures!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Gruesome Grueling Intrigue, Swedish Style","Perhaps it is the current need to see that evil eventually consumes itself that make films like THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO (AKA ""Män som hatar kvinnor"") so successful. Or it may be the posthumous fame given Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy (from which this film is 'Millennium: Part 1 - Men Who Hate Women') that has prepared an audience of believers. Whatever the reason this first installment (the other two installments have already been filmed and are ready for release) is being hailed as an epic masterpiece, a film that will go down in cinematic history as a classic. And for that reason you may want to see this current long exploration of the evil of man. But is it a masterpiece.....?Nikolaj Arcel and Rasmus Heisterberg adapted this book for the screen and the script is interpreted by director Niels Arden Oplev who has cast the many characters of the story with some excellent Swedish actors. By the end of this multi-twisted tale we are left satisfied with the balance of good over evil - or are we? After all we're only part way there and, as in the BOURNE SERIES in this country, subsequent parts to the story become only more bizarre - and exciting. At any rate, the story in brief deals with an investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) whose apparent loss of a case of libel against a wealthy corrupt corporate group results in his being chosen by an elderly but mentally vigorous gentleman Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube) to investigate a long buried case of the apparent murder of his niece -a deed Vanger is convinced is associated with his disgustingly morally corrupt family. Blomkvist is fascinated and begins his tedious examination of film and facts that seem to add clues as to the mystery surrounding Harriet Vanger's disappearance. Enter a punk rock appearing, pierced and tattooed young girl Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Repace) who ends up assisting Blomkvist in solving the conundrum. After some rather confusing bits of replay of Lisbeth's past and the revelation of her current situation with a guardian assigned to control her after her recent discharge from an institution, we are allowed to watch the discovery of 40 years of serial killings of young girls: the fact that they are all Jewish and that Vanger's family contains a number of ex-Nazis boils the pot. Much gore, visual exposure to violence and the results of violence flood the screen as the eventual discovery of the true history of Harriet Vanger is uncovered.The film is two and a half hours long but seems much shorter because of the rapid fire sequencing by the director. Much praise has been heaped on Noomi Repace as Lisbeth and while she performs well, and looks bizarre, one wonders why all the hoopla. This is a good film of its kind, very well transforming a book into cinematic excess, and for those who crave gore and acts of depravity it will probably please. For film goers who prefer thinking to raw action this may not be the choice of a film du jour. In Swedish with subtitles and with English dubbing.Grady Harp",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Exciting and Complex,"I read the book before I'd heard anyone talk about it. This was before the huge upheaval of praise for the late Stieg Larsson's three novels.

She has led a dark life after a horrible upbringing. She has been abused by the ""system."" She hooks up with a high profile investigative reporter who is known as a bit of a womanizer. The two find themselves in the middle of a case involving the disappearance, many years before, of the daughter of a very rich man. This leads them to uncover many unsettling facts.

One of the Ten Best Films of 2009,"""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is probably one of the most daring and original films ever made and easily one of the ten best films made in 2009. This is a film with several different plot lines - one about a very gifted, but anti-social and violent, outsider named Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) who eventually triumphs over amazing odds, another about a brilliant and gutsy journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nvqvist) who takes a chance on a daring story, loses his reputation and liberty and then searches for a comeback, and another about a millionaire Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube) who, before he dies, wants to find out who murdered his daughter Harriet - that all come together in surprising, original and creative ways. This film is also a murder mystery which is so complex and profound that it is engrossing to watch Blomkvist and Salander work together in trying to solve it.What I find remarkable about this movie is that Swedish director Niels Arden Oplev and writer Nikolaj Arcel are able to take all these different plot lines and create a uniform masterpiece out of it with great cinematography (and there are some really good images in this movie) to boot. And yes the movie lasts for 2 hours and 30 minutes, but I can say unequivocably that this film is so interesting that I did not notice those 150 minutes go by. Furthermore, the performances in this movie are incredible. Noomi Rapace brings to her performance an intellectual brilliance and frenetic energy - as evidenced even by the little things like smoking one cigarette after the next or the abrupt way she interacts with others - that makes the character Lisbeth Salander fascinating to watch. Michael Nyqvist is also wonderful as the journalist Blomkvist who develops the most unexpected, but nonetheless believable, relationship with Salander. But even my assessment here does not give this film its proper due. I feel like telling everyone don't ask me about the plot and don't ask me about the characters. Just watch the movie and experience it for yourself. I would recommend ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" to anyone, except to those under the age of 18 since they are likely to be very disturbed by the graphic scenes in this picture. This is a film for adults. Thumbs way up.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A Star is Born...,"In one of the most pleasant surprises to grace the screens in 2010, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (or if you prefer, Män som hatar kvinnor) is one of the best films of the year so far. Director Niels Arden Oplev has placed a stamp on foreign and independent cinema in a big way that I haven't seen since Fernando Mierelles blazed the screens with City of God.Oplev's Swedish-language film, based on the popular book series by the late Stieg Larsson, and adapted for the screen by Nikolaj Arcel & Rasmus Heisterberg, tells the story of a journalist and a female computer hacker, who's paths cross in order to solve a 40-year old missing person case within a powerful and corrupt family, where no one trusts no one. The film is such a terrific and smart thriller, encapsulating all the great things about the mystery genre into one tightly wrapped cinematic experience.One of the most spectacular things to come out of the film is the breakthrough and stellar performance of newcomer Noomi Rapace, who sizzles in her role as ""Lisbeth Salander,"" the guarded yet vulnerable computer genius, who finds herself drawn to the honorable ""Mikael Blomkvist"" played tenderly by Mihcael Nyqvist. Rapace bares her soul in the complex Lisbeth, which allows her to keep the audience at a distance, never allowing us near unless she gives permission. It's a rare experience in film to feel so distant from a character yet yearn and fight to be close and understand them, that's the achievement of Rapace's performance.Nyqvist is the film's Knight in shining armor, trusting himself to the character and laying it down so effortlessly. He gains the trust and admiration of the audience early on and sustains it for the long runtime of 2 hours and 34 minutes. The rest of the cast, all turn in superb and fierce performances from the grotesque family members to the heinous and evil parole guardian, you will find yourself on a emotional roller-coaster.What the film does is set the pace and the excitement for the future adaptations of the series, The Girl Who Played with Fire, and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, all slated for releases in the next year. Hopefully with its very independent and limited release, a honorable movie-goer can experience the new generation of mystery films standing next to the greatness of Alfred Hitchcock's infamous thrillers in his career. Oplev and his writing team reinvent the genre and raise it to new levels.***½/****",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The suspense didn't translate to the movie.,"Maybe this just isn't a good book to adapt because it is so long with so much complexity. The script writers did what they had to and focused on the main storyline, but even that seemed insufficient. It felt very rushed and so you didn't get any of the initial moods of hopelessness, pointlessness and obsession with the case you get in the book, or the epiphany when the first breakthrough was made. Instead, the revelation of the plot seemed mechanical. Again, this probably can be chalked up to the time constraints of a movie.The positive was the character development of Lisbeth. No doubt this was in large part due to Noomi's performance. But also it was because the writers didn't skimp on her character development, like they did with the storyline.So the impression I was left with was, while this was a good attempt and a very watchable movie, it wasn't near as gripping as the book was. I wouldn't mind seeing another attempt with a Hollywood remake if they put some talent behind it, just to see what someone else could do to bring the mystery that the book possessed to the screen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Excellent detective yarn,"With Stieg Larsson's books flying off the shelves and director's such as David Fincher rumoured to be interested in directing the Hollywood version, the first film version, made and set in the book's locale of Sweden is an excellent movie. I have not read the book, so in this case I could only view the movie as just that, a movie. My instinctive was that the movie was formulaic. That is to say that it followed a very well worn and familiar path that detective stories follow (stories because this can also encompass detective literature). That's not to denigrate the movie at all; the film is an absorbing detective story that has enough about it to engross you for the full 2 and a half hours. Which is where, I think, we do start to notice differences between detective stories. Detective stories have a lot of exposition to get through as more often than not, the information gathered about all of the protagonists helps lead to the culprit. The key to that in film is to handle the exposition in such a way that the audience does not realise that they are purely being fed information. Varying the locations and the characters that provide the exposition helps enormously; particularly if you have a strange character in a strange location providing the details. In TGWTDT, the characters do have depth and the locations are generally good, but this gimmick is not relied on too heavily. Nor is the tried and tested ""if you think the pace is flagging, have someone burst through the door with a gun"" used at all. Instead, I felt that the film held my attention by appealing to the puzzle solver in me. The detectives, in this case a disgraced journalist and a professional hacker, are meticulous and methodical in their approach. They uncover clues and patterns throughout their investigation, all of which got me thinking along the same lines and, occasionally, coming to the same conclusions at the same time. So another key area for success with a detective story is to keep the audience engaged, but not to let them get further ahead with their own investigations until it is time to crank up the tension because we now know what is about to befall our heroes. TGWTDT provides all of these. It is low on action, but when action is called for it delivers with short sudden bursts that jolt the viewer. It also carries with it a level of brutality that provides shocks in place of action sequences. If you want something that doesn't jolt you out of your comfort zone (watching a detective unravel the mystery without engaging your own brain), then avoid this. If you want an engaging and involving detective story experience then go see this movie. I have intentionally avoided referencing the story, as I think this movie is probably best viewed with no preconceptions. Having said that, my girlfriend had read the book and felt that the film, although abbreviated the book, did include most of what was required and was still thoroughly enjoyable. www.writeronthestorm.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Public Justice, Private Happiness","I'm always ready to censure the MPAA in whatever way I can. When they say, ""Strong brutal violence including a rape,"" we think, well rape is strong brutal violence! You could've just said strong brutal violence without giving anything away! But in the case of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, I'm beginning to see why they make that distinction. I could've seen someone get killed with seven chainsaws and not be as disturbed as I was by the rape scene that occurs a few minutes short of an hour into this surprisingly standard but strangely bewildering film. This rape is foreshadowed by a forced blowjob. The man is in knowingly and insatiably sadistic control of the woman. Then comes the rape proper. It goes on longer than it needs to in order to make the point that this woman is brutally raped. What is it telling us? An emotional point of reference, I believe, for the unraveling of the investigative plot later to come.Walking into this film adaptation of one of the most astonishing literary success stories in years, I was excited because of my previous experiences with Swedish cinema. The subtleties, the artfulness, the minimalism especially. Bergman, Sjostrom, Kaurismaki. I was off-put by the very mainstream American handling of the story, which is frankly, on the surface, quite an American creation. It's a mystery thriller, two unlikely underdog heroes teamed up to crack an ongoing case. And that's great! But there is also an edge to this story not unlike Mike Yanagita's scene in Fargo. During the story, we are subjected to seemingly extraneous chronicles of pure evil, harrowing brutality and subtext that seems constrained by the otherwise tight clockwork of the case-solving plot.Nevertheless, I am continually intrigued by said unorthodoxy of its structure. I have yet to read the book, and maybe I will soon. I love the first shots of the saga's heroine, Lisbeth Salander, as she walks alone through pedestrian tunnels. This is where I become absorbed in the tone and style of the picture. And I'm not let down as her character arc continues. She is truly one of the most intriguing main characters I've seen in a movie in a very long time. She is a mystery, characterized by significant hang-ups in her interactions outside of those she knows or chooses to engage, along with unvarying yet strangely contrary patterns of behavior and interests. I love her chemistry with Blomqvist, the journalist-under-fire who seems to be our central protagonist, how their arc together flirts with formula, but ultimately defies it.The performances are effective all around. But while all of the performances are powerful, including those of Michael Nyqvist as the admirably zen journalist, and Peter Haber as the implacable brother of the vanished girl in question, this movie and this character are endemic to Noomi Rapace, to the degree that casting anyone else as Lisbeth in a way almost sounds fool-headed. She commands a sophisticated and enticingly refractory performance in a story that shaves off coatings of society cues and behavioral expectations to reveal camouflaged penalties women suffer for their selfhood.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A Nutshell Review: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"Based upon the novel by the late Stieg Larsson, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is one of those films that is crafted superbly enough for Hollywood to take notice and want to toss it on the remake gravy train. Daniel Craig has been attached to star, and you will understand why David Fincher has been appointed director of the upcoming Hollywood version, because the mystery in this film is something right up Fincher's alley, and I felt cutting close to his Zodiac at times as well. But why settle for a remake when you can now watch the original?Niels Arden Oplev directed a sprawling introduction to the world of the titular computer hacker known as Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace), as well as that of an investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist, who's waiting to serve time for his supposedly libelous Millennium magazine article on an influential industrialist. We follow separate narrative threads that introduce both main characters and the challenges they face in their lives, one with a jail term looming, while the other having to surrender to the whims and fancies of her parole officer who's out to look for sexual favours in exchange for lenient reports.But of course our spunky Lisbeth is more than that damsel in distress. Noomi Rapace gives her plenty of attitude as she takes charge of situations, never cowing away from fisticuffs should the need arise, and possesses enough mean streak in her by way of a grunge punk rock look to wonder why such inner high walls built to shield herself from the injustices that she had suffered. Michael Nygvist's Mikael also isn't our typical alpha-male, and is more the down to earth type of hero who relies on his wit, written word and networking abilities to see him through a paid assignment by a tycoon to track down his missing niece.The narrative takes some time to warm up, and when it finally does, everything careens at full speed, with the investigators coming together to pool resources and smarts in solving a 40 year old mystery. The two and a half hours seemed to be compressed, with Oplev demonstrating a measured yet intense grip on how the proceedings of the story will unfold, with bit by bit revelations becoming the hook to draw you into the mystery. In some ways, the story may resemble in part to that of Murder of the Inugami Clan, where an extended family comes filled with relatively bizarre characters each hiding little secrets that threaten to explode, and each contributing a step closer to the truth.While Oplev designs a mystery thriller, there are some tools of the trade used in horror films that get employed to great effect here as well, especially the build up of anticipation where the dynamic duo begin to get close to fishing out results, with nicely done interplay between light and shadow, and jump cuts even that worked to keep you at the edge of your seat. You'll find yourself inevitably attracted to the plight of the characters and will invest enough emotions that will root for, and desire that they emerge unscathed from an investigations that seem to scream Trouble and Danger.There are the follow up Swedish films in Larsson's Millennium Trilogy, inclusive of this installment already released so far outside of Singapore, and hopefully we'll get to see the other two hit our shores soon enough. This one's left uncut, so all the nudity and graphic, gruesome stills were intact, in which the latter can be a little bit unsettling. But don't let that put you off from an engaging mystery, and finally you can watch something the world out there has been raving about! Recommended!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A very solid and suspenseful mystery,"2010 has been a year full of misses at the cinema. I haven't seen too many films I would call memorable, and even fewer I would say have made my list of top films of the year. But allow me to add one to that list. Though it isn't a perfect film, this Swedish cinematic treat is great in its old fashioned ways and creates one of the coolest and most memorable characters of the year.The film is a murder mystery that starts in two different lives. We meet Mikel Blomkvist, a reporter who has just lost a court battle against a major company in an attempt to expose its corrupt CEO. We also meet Lisbeth, a punk-looking hacker who works as a researcher for a security firm and appears to be in some kind of legal trouble. After the initial court battle, Mikel is invited to an island by a powerful and wealthy retiree to help put to rest a 40-year old murder mystery. Along the way, Lisbeth and Mikel's lives become intertwined and together they attempt to finally solve the mystery.The film plays mostly as an old fashioned murder mystery, with Mikel sifting through clues and Lisbeth using her computer skills to scour for information. Both main characters are played very well, with Mikel being the very intrepid and determined reporter. He's quiet and somewhat reserved, but has a good head about his shoulders and is quite smart. While he is good, he is a bit ordinary and doesn't particularly stand out. This works in that he is relatable, but this also causes him to be overshadowed by the best character in the film, Lisbeth.From the first time we meet her, we are introduced to a character who is unusual but also very cool. She is unlike anyone else in the film and has a very good depth of emotion. Her appearance not with standing, this is a woman who doesn't take crap from anyone. Cross her, and you will find yourself in a world of hurt. This is evidenced twice early on, first when she is attacked at a subway by a group of young men and second when she seeks revenge on a superior (probably one of the more painful scenes in the movie). She certainly gets the most painful and powerful scenes of the film and shows many layers that make her one of the most interesting characters I have seen all year.The mystery itself is quite good. It's very involving and thankfully, very old fashioned. There isn't a whole lot of action here, but the movie presents enough of a mix of character development and suspense that you're never really bored with anything happening. Just when it seems like the film might slow down, it gets back apace with more of the mystery. There's also no wasted camera work here. You might half expect to find lingering shots or useless cinematography, but there's none of that here.I guess the least that can be said is that the film is wholly entertaining. The characters are never boring and the story is quite good with some very pleasant twists. It's not perfect. In particular, one sex scene seems a little out of place and Mikel and Lisbeth's relationship seemed a little forced, but these are minor complaints. I got over them quickly. This is a very entertaining film that I am proud to call one of my favorites for 2010.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Absurd and disgusting,"Although wonderfully well acted, the plot of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is ridiculous and implausible.

"Better than average, but lacks depth","I was half-way into reading the book when I decided to catch the movie because of the hype. Wife never read the book. After viewing the film, while I enjoyed it better than the average American thriller, I was not as overwhelmed by it as the hype surrounding the film. To give it credit, the two protagonists, Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Bloomqvist, are definitely an interesting crime solving duo, and one of the most unique in recent times. Both the actors do a good job with their characters. However, while the book takes its time in delving into the the intricacies of the mystery, I felt that the movie kind of cut out some of the interesting relationships that kept you interested in the story. Also, a key element in the book (Venestrom affair) were briefly alluded to in the movie, but are probably key in making this story more poignant. Wife and I both agree that while not overwhelming, it did jog our interest to see the second movie. Personally, would have waited for the rental. I am interested to see if the Hollywood version can make itself more powerful, but will wait for reviews before even considering going to see it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The film with the brilliance of a Hitchcock or Scorsese,"This film adaptation of Stieg Larsson's critically acclaimed novel brings together all the attributes of a classic murder mystery that is vibrant, intense and consistently intriguing.The Swedish film, directed by Niels Arden Oplev, opens with a sentimental scene and shortly followed by the journalist's alleged law breaking.Michael Nyqvist plays Mikael Blomkvist who is shortly asked to solve a mystery that has plagued Henrik Vanger for years, the disappearance of a family member over 40 years ago.Keeping close tabs on Mikael's activity is 24 years old Lisbeth, a quiet yet clever individual who gets mistreated by her guardian and who soon gets wrapped up in Mikael's investigation and soon the clues are flowing and the film gets better and better.The initial slow moving scenes help engage us into the worlds of each character and with such close detailed segments, such as Mikael's family life and Lisbeth's job and guardian changes we are immersed into worlds of deceit and corruption.The plot boasts heavy life issues. There is a strong focus upon sexual hurt, the rape scene at the beginning is squeamish to watch and one of the eventual conclusions is equally horrible. All necessary and credit to Oplev who doesn't shy away from the pain and anguish of the film's most poignant moments. The high certificate's for this film are down to these moments of sexual indiscretion and violent themes and all fit necessarily into the film's plot.The mystery of the missing girl pans out very well. Somehow the director is able to lay traps for you to interpret who is who and who may be a killer and what happened all those years ago and for that factor this has to be the best mystery film I have watched in sometime.There are many factors elsewhere to enjoy. I personally loved the fact that this film had many features that in a Hollywood film would be corny but were handled with respect and a unique nature, such as the flashback scenes and the more intimate moments, all perfectly balanced and with blissfully no music to coincide with each moment.Its hard to compare to other films but there is a feeling of a Scorsese with an excitement of a Hitchcock here, though its quite subtle and that makes this special. It isn't a copy, it isn't a wannabe Hollywood it is raw, real and ravishing.Last year I tried to start the novel but unfortunately did not follow it through. Having watched this film and loved it I shall definitely pursue the sequel, the girl who played with fire, which has recently been adapted into a film. Given everything that took place in this film I got the impression that the books would all be powerful, exciting and intense and should anyone ask, I would suggest read the books then enjoy the film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Into A Darker Labyrinth,"When journalist Mikael Blomquist is sued by a financier,due to allegations of corruption (and is looking at possible jail time),he is temporarily given a ""holiday break"" from the magazine he is working for. Mikael is hired by the aged patriarch of the highly dysfunctional millionaire family,the Vangers. Mikael is given free reign to find out just what happened to Harriet Vanger,who vanished from the family at the age of 16. Mikael finds out just how screwed up the Vanger clan really is,and is drawn into a web of corruption,political graft,potential murder,sexual perversion,and other elements he probably should have just taken a pass and just taken time off,instead. Also figuring into all of this is a mysterious young woman known as Lisbeth Salendar,a woman who has been the whipping girl for far too long (she has a short fuse,an attitude problem,and other dark issues as well). Somehow,these two bond to try & sort out all of this insanity. Denmark's Niels Arden Oplev directs from a screenplay written by Nikolaj Arcel & Rasmus Heisterberg,from the celebrated novel by the late Swedish author,Stieg Larsson. This is the first chapter in a trilogy of films based on Larsson's novels,which has already been filmed,and has been released throughout Europe. I eagerly await the next two films. Spoken in Swedish with English subtitles. Not rated by the MPAA,this film contains pervasive strong language,strong sexual content,nudity & some graphic,bloody violence that will disturb some (and this is from the same country that originally banned Star Wars in 1977,because it was considered too violent for it's time)",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
great film,"This is a great film and deserves to be rated higher. I am very fussy about films but was captivated by the whole trilogy - if you like the first film then it is well worth watching the next two as well. The acting is subtle and not overplayed, and there's no dramatic music and cheesiness that you get in your usual dose of US blockbuster - it is a genuine thriller and great to have such a strong and multilayered female character. The very last scene at the end of the third film (""the girl who kicked the hornets nest"") sums up the whole three films. Why oh why are they doing a remake with Daniel Craig, what a mistake, the original is excellent and perfectly fine to watch with subtitles.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
An Untrainable Dragon,"Greetings again from the darkness. What usually sets apart a great mystery thriller from an average one is the story. In part one of the Millennium trilogy based on Stieg Larsson's books, the story is really good, but the point of difference comes in the titular performance of Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth. American audiences are rarely treated to this type of raw, gritty performance from an actress. She alone makes the film worth seeing.Please don't get me wrong ... I really like the film. A murder mystery who-dunnit that on the surface appears like an Agathy Christie story, it quickly proves to us how looks can be deceiving - both in story line and in characters. Though the story wraps up a bit too neatly, the long winding road (over a fortuitous bridge) gives us a wild ride of hints, suspects and research that is a blast for those who enjoy such things.Michael Nyqvist stars as Mikael Blomkvist, an investigative writer who gets set up on charges of libel against a powerful businessman. While awaiting his jail time, Blomkvist is hired by an 80 year old uncle of a girl gone missing some 40 years ago. Oh yes, she is part of the Vanger family who live on a private island and who have multiple members with a history of Nazi loyalties. As Blomkvist investigates the ancient mystery, it turns out he is being followed via super-hacker Lisbeth. After a few twists, these two turn into a highly unlikely, but very interesting and effective mystery-solving couple.Besides the performance of Rapace, what really sets this one apart is that the villains really aren't the most interesting characters - Blomkvist and Lisbeth are. We are treated to a great deal of character development for both, and trust me when I say, Lisbeth's story is not pleasant.I hear this will be Americanized in the remake and that makes me sad. The edgy undercurrent of sex, abuse, politics and religious racism will undoubtedly be softened and surely the lead actress will bring little of the fascination that Noomi Rapace delivers.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
terrible movie,"the book is great, really unique, and I understand that they had to leave out big parts of the story for the movie, but it's a lousy screenplay, and the actors are nothing like the characters in the book..Blomquist in the book is intelligent and thoughtful and Nyqvist the actor who portrays Blomquist in the movie is not an intelligent man..same for Noomi Rapace, who plays Salander,she's better than Nyqvist, but Salander in the book is much more interesting and complex than the way Rapace portrays her in the movie..I'm not going to bother with the other 2 movies, will stick to the books..don't believe the hype about this movie..",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Slow, but Good","For a foreign film I was surprised with how good this movie was. What carries the movie through is the acting and script. These actors surprisingly followed through as they gave a great performance. The filming itself was of a lower budget, but the scenic views were beautiful. The biggest downfall to the film is how slow it is, it takes quite awhile to get anywhere ""into"" the film as the pace slowly picks up. But once it gets going the movie quickly becomes intriguing. When I watched the movie I did not read up on what it was about or its content as I find this usually spoils a movie for me, but I was shocked at its graphic rape scenes. They do not spare much as they show a lot of graphic sexual content in the movie along with the horror of what a human can do to another human. With all that said the movie does well at hitting on the heart strings and a few nerves too. It's a compelling film as you slowly try to uncover the truth of what's what.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Soild movie - very true to the novel, but be warned...","I want to start by saying that this reviewer thoroughly enjoyed the movie, Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, after reading (and thoroughly enjoying) the novel it is based upon.However, I WANT TO WARN any punters that read the first book, and plan on reading the second installment in the Millennium Series: The Girl Who Played With Fire. It only occurred to me once I started reading Stieg Larsson's subsequent novel that a key 'twist' or piece of information that he keeps hidden from the reader until the final third of the book was already blatantly obvious to me. As a result of this, I couldn't help but feel slightly robbed of the chance of being sucked into the story, and any hope of resolving this twist on my own accord.This movie does not explicitly spell out what is to happen in the second story, but if anyone has even a limited experience in cinema, or even a basic understanding of storytelling, then you will most likely come to the conclusion that I made (while watching this movie), and be thoroughly upset when you already know one of the 'secret' moments in the second novel.Based on my experience, I would recommend reading ALL the novels before one sees any of the movies.Of course, if reading the books is not in your plan, then go ahead and see the movies - they are great!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A pleasant surprise,"Watched this film last night on British pay to view. I was initially put off by its length, however I felt the story was strong, acted well and the differing characters were contrasted superbly. The subtext of ""don't be surprised about what goes on behind closed doors"" and I think a look into some of the more unsavoury aspects of Sweden's past was another insightful subtext.It certainly wouldn't be screened by the Swedish tourist board and only reflects on a small aspect of the community.A brave non conventional thriller, no real hero, all characters flawed to a degree, and I think an almost predictable ending, however a good watch!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
one of the better crime mysteries that you will see,"The movie is rated R with nudity & some violence.In ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" directed by Niels Arden Oplev, is adopted from the 1st book of the hugely popular ""Millennium Trilogy"" series written by Stieg Larsson. Spare a thought for Larsson because he died before any of the trilogy books were published. The movie is the biggest ever Scandinavian movie & the highest grossing movie of Europe in 2009. There are 2 more sequels to this film which have been already released in Sweden & will be released in U.S in the coming months. I didn't read the novel but as the movie is gradually unfolding, you can actually feel like reading the book. The literal translation of the Swedish title is Men who hate Women.Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube) is a retired former head of a business empire as well as the head of a big dynasty. 40 years ago his niece Harriet has disappeared & her body was never found. Henrik, for whom Harriet is like a daughter, is convinced that she is murdered by some one from his own family & he employs a tainted journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) to find the murderer. Mikael gets an unlikely partner in the form of the antisocial computer hacker Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) who is fighting some demons from her own past. They form an unlikely detective pair & together they must find the murderer before they themselves became the target.For a movie to be a good crime thriller, in my opinion, you need good screenplay & editing along with great story & performances. DEcent music doesn't hurt either. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a perfect package of all the above.The plot is not as simple as I've mentioned above. There are many layers to the story. Characters in the movie are not some simple caricatures but are filled with real meat & flesh. Michael Nyquist as the disgraced journalist has done a very good job. All the supporting cast are good.But the performance of the movie goes to the girl with the dragon tattoo Noomi Rapace. Hers was the toughest job. She played the role of a young woman who has been abused since childhood by society & most of the people that she knows. So she develops a kind of apathy towards the society. Even when she finally finds a man whom she loves, her troubled past means she can't trust him. Also she is afraid to take the next step & can't express her love. Lisbeth Salander is one of the more complex characters that you will see this year. In an interview Rapace said that she knows Lisbeth in & out. It shows in her performance. After the movie I googled Noomi Rapace & I was astonished with the difference between the real Rapace & reel Lisbeth. If I give you the pictures of Rapace & Lisbeth, you would think they are completely different persons. A double thumbs-up for Rapace. Of late, I've heard that some idiots are remaking this. Whoever takes her role has a really huge shoes to fill in.Nikolaj Arcel & Rasmus Heisterberg have done a good job in adopting the screenplay to the big screen. Anne Østerud has done an exceptional job with the editing. With appropriate background score & good cinematography the movie was very well made.Niels Arden Oplev has handled the 150 min movie very well without letting loose the grip anywhere. Of course the screenplay definitely helped him.I was dangling whether to give this 8 or 9 but since I'm not witnessing the release of many good crime mysteries these days, I went with a 9. Without a doubt, this will be one of the best crime mysteries that you will see this year.For more reviews visit http://amarsmoviejournal.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Very competent adaptation of complicated novel,"Really enjoyed this film despite having read the book and therefore knowing the ending which I won't spoil here. Rapace will deservedly get most of the plaudits, but kudos also to some of the minor cast members who do a good job bringing their roles to life. Salander's sadistic guardian, Bjurman, is particularly well played as a thoroughly loathsome individual.Plot is very well interpreted for the screen with some aspects left out for logical reasons. Kind of wanted more of the Wennerstrom stuff, but I guess they covered it pretty well without disrupting the main story. As I said, despite knowing the ending, I found it very absorbing and it was fun watching Salander and Blomkvist make sense of the few available clues.Looking forward to The Girl who Played with Fire!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
(review of American cut): what a mystery movie should do nowadays- absorb us in and get us set for anything,"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is concerned with its plot, but also, and maybe even more-so than in most American films, with the characters. It's as if the Swedish filmmaker behind the film, by way of the very popular book(s) by Stieg Larsson, doesn't want to compromise anything with the characters for the sake of the story. So the film becomes a balancing act between its themes and its characters, its plot and its persons going through trying to figure out what happened to Harriet Vanger forty years ago. I'm not saying they're the most fully rounded and developed beings in a mystery movie ever, but I'm glad to see that a filmmaker has the guts to put the characters up front for us, particularly the force on the screen in Lisbeth Salander played by Noomi Rapace.It's her that we're given as the real lead of the story - by the end it feels as if the story, however neat and tidy it might seem (and, perhaps as a slight fault, be it through the cutting of the Swedish version or not, a little too tidy), continues with her and not journalist Mikael Blomkvist, and given perspective. While the story, about the search through the case file closed long ago for the disappearance of Harriet, is engrossing once it really gets going, it's also about women, and the violence done to them. We've seen a killer with this sort of sick method before, of the kind of 'true' evil and hatred that comes out of repression and racism and, yes, inbreeding. But not put into the context of a lead character who, throughout her life leading up to this case she stumbles upon, has had to put up with the worst in men. Really, really bad men.Indeed The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo carries with it a rather nasty undercurrent that may turn off viewers expecting just a mystery story. In its own right it's as hard to take as Silence of the Lambs was for audiences back in 1991, as we're brought in to what sort of frame of mind might do such a thing as kill an innocent girl (or, as we learn, more). But what it is, at the least, is just a plain well-told story. You know the kind, where we're given hero-characters (maybe more flawed here than usual, but still) put to task to find out just what happened. And like a really grisly and humanly ghastly murder mystery as the layers are peeled away it feels ickier, the images of those pictures, those slaughtered girls Harriet alluded to in her notes, appearing before us like ghosts.If the director exceeds at creating just a bit of mood with his story (and, while a repititious method, the dissolves and super-impositions create a really strong palette visually to draw upon), he also cast his film with some strength. I'm sure just based on this film Rapace doesn't have to worry about a career for a while, and not just in Sweden. I could see her playing as a tough girl in a thriller here in the States, or, just as well, a more vulnerable character as Lisbeth is both (albeit I've yet to see her in anything else, this could work just fine as a calling card showing a multitude of range with the exception of, of course, comedy). Her character is like a cross between a femme fatale and a runaway from life, dangerous and hostile with layers built up to protect herself (and, sometimes, it has to come in handy with horrors like her really sick-f*** new probation officer). On the opposite side of her is a more subtle turn from Nyqvist, who has to be more restrained as he's the more 'normal' character, or with more on his plate (his character is after all being set-up in another case he worked on).So, the ultimate effect of Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is that of solid storytelling matched with strong characters. We want to see the characters solve the mystery, as dark and depressing as it gets (and really as lurid as it does too, something David Fincher can work with perhaps in the American remake). While it's not really a 'perfect' thriller or mystery by any stretch - some plot holes, such as why the characters don't take the pictures touched by the intruder fingerprinted when they're so investigative about everything else, or why Lisbeth lets a character go in a crucial scene - it involved me more than I can think of from a mystery-killer movie in a while.

Superb film,"This is an excellent movie with a standalone plot, so that you wouldn't necessarily have to plan to watch parts 2 and 3 of ""The Girl"" trilogy. The plot contains mystery, suspense, action, and closure.The two main actors, Rapace and Nyqvist, do such a great job of creating characters that that you might come to know and like that you might feel compelled to follow them into parts 2 and 3; if so, you should plan on watching both of those, as 2 leads right into 3.The supporting actors are supportive, and the bleak winter Swedish landscape contributes to the pleasurable and menacing tone of the film.One of the most enjoyable movies that I have treated myself to, after reading the excellent books. I should add that this movie contains ""very mature"" themes.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Where a hack journo plus computer hacker hack away at family secrets.,"The Europeans excel at producing thriller movies. This, the first of a trilogy, maintains that high standard.The story: a disgraced journalist is hired by the head of a super-rich industrialist family to find his niece, Harriet, who disappeared forty years earlier. Together with a raunchy, Gothic, young female computer hacker, the two unlikely partners in detection unravel the mystery of Harriet's disappearance and unearth a horrific family secret.As stories go, it's on-the-edge-of-your-seat suspense that gradually builds to a finale that includes a nod to Silence of the Lambs (1991) and others similar. So, yes, the plot treads well-known territory; however, it's distinctive from others you may recall, in that the young female hacker is one of the cleverest and toughest female protagonists to grace the screen since Ripley socked it to the mother of all Aliens (1986).So, it's an ultra-violent (at times), in-your-face tour-de-force combination of introspective and analytical detection, coupled within moments of brutality that some will – for sure – find difficult to watch; in that regard, I'm reminded of the gory brutality of Eastern Promises (2007). The acting is, in my opinion, almost flawless; only some of the early scenes and clips seemed a bit stagy. Kudos, however, go to the two main stars: Michael Nyqvist as the convicted journalist, Mikael Blomqvist; and Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander – a newcomer for me, and one whom I will continue to watch as her career develops.Cinematography, editing, and sound-track are all topnotch, as expected from well-produced and financed Swedish films. Coupled with a narrative structure and script that grab you by the throat, I had no trouble sitting through the entire 152 minutes without any fidgeting or clock watching. Overall, the pacing and the gradual revelation of the interlocking story details reminded me very much of the way the mystery unfolded in The List of Adrian Messenger (1963), one of the best mystery/detective stories ever put to film (although, the book was much better).My only (muted) criticism of the story comes to this: while I know, from personal experience, that almost unbelievable co-incidences do actually occur, there is one very necessary story co-incidence – a married couple, on honeymoon, who take and keep a crucial photograph – without which the mystery would have forever remained unsolved. You'll know it when you see it.And see this one, I think you should, despite any misgivings you might have about reading sub-titles. It's a very visual story, and the talking is just enough. I'm eagerly looking forward to the second and third chapters. Highly recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Completely exceeded my expectations, the buzz about this movie is totally justified.","""You don't know my family. You don't know what they're capable of. ""A disgraced reporter is hired by a wealthy older man to investigate the mysterious disappearance and possible murder of his favorite niece many years ago. The reporter, Mikhail, is eventually joined by a emotionally damaged young and mysterious computer hacker named Lisbeth. They both face a considerable amount of danger as they dig into the girl's death and the many secrets of her family.The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was very good. Even better than I expected. I have no experience with the book (yet) so I can't make that comparison, but judging the movie only on it's own merits leaves very little doubt that it's high quality in every way.It's a murder mystery and suspense thriller (the best of those genres that I've seen in quite a while) that's outright brutal to watch at times.  The story is riveting, and I found myself wanting to know what happened to young Harriet back in 1966 as much as any of the characters in the movie did. Lisbeth and Mikael were two excellent and complex protagonists who are expertly played by their respective actors, the entire movie is thrilling and engaging, and the ending was satisfying. This was an excellent movie overall, and I recommend it to anyone who likes murder mysteries and can handle some pretty graphic and violent scenes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The Millennium Trilogy off to a 'fiery' start!,"Niels Arden Oplev coheres together an excellent re-telling of Stieg Larrson's first novel in 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' collection.The ambiance is certainly dark throughout however atmosphere is lighted with the occasional use of black humour. In all fairness, 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' is certainly a disturbingly atmospheric novel to place on the big screen and this makes the movie difficult to view in certain areas.The narrative is fairly simple as a Swedish journalist (Michael Nyqvist) is on hand to help a desperate old man (Sven-Bertil Taube) re-ignite a search for his daughter, 40 years after her disappearance. As her personal life gets on top of her, Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) stumbles across journalist Mikael and forms a partnership in a bid to assist him in his investigation.The story maybe decent however is often rather bloated and isn't as engaging as it could perhaps be. Also, the film is rather worded; this isn't always a negative however it is considering it's duration stretches over two and a half hours.The anchoring of the film is down to the chemistry between Nyquvist and Rapace. It ranges from various things such as their awkwardness at fist, their ability to work as a team and their differences in personalities which add a darkly comedic factor to a rather adult themed tale.Another recommendable feature is the concluding half an hour which ties everything up sufficiently well and injects a essence of energy to the affair.All in all, superb characterisation and on-screen chemistry from the leading cast members as well as a fitting conclusion make 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' a fabulous if gritty watch. Had it not been let down for its frequently slow pacing and familiar plot, it would have scored higher.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A good thriller,"The girl with the dragon tattoo is based on the novels the Millennium Trilogy by Swedish author Stieg Larsson. It is a dark thriller that deals with money, corruption, sex and murder. The heroine Lisbeth Salander is wonderfully played by Noomi Rapace. Lisbeth is a hacker for hire that is on parole. She becomes interested in a local journalist Mikael Blomkvist. Mikael is soon to begin a prison term for libel against a wealthy businessman when he is hired by the Vanger family to investigate the 40 year old murder of a 16 year old.Lisbeth has a talent for finding secrets although we, the audience, are kept unaware of the skeletons in her closet. Clearly, a troubled young woman she is intrigued by the case of the journalist whom she believes has been set up. She hacks into his computer to follow the Vanger case and comes across the answer to a clue. She emails Mikael the information which begins there partnership in solving the case.The setting in the first half of the movie is just as cold and stark as the characters in the story. As Mikael and Lisbeth get closer (or warmer) to the answers of the missing girl, so does the setting. Winter gives way to spring and Mikael and Lisbeth's friendship thaws out as well.Noomi delivers a brooding pain that is conveyed realistically without being stiff. Very little is revealed of Lisbeth's past but the audience is enthralled waiting, wondering what happened to her to make her the woman that she is? The story gives us interesting twists and turns as we follow the partners piece together 40 year old clues. Who would want to kill a 16 year old girl and why? As the case is slowly revealed we are kept intrigued until its satisfying ending.

Horrible. Sensationalized the sordid parts,"I'm so glad I read the book. There was a lot more to the story than the sexually provocative parts. This movie is pathetic. Maybe the American version will be better. The only worthwhile thing is the scenery.The actress who played Lisbeth Salander was too old for the part. Parts of the story hinged on the fact that she looked like a young teen-aged girl. The actress could never pass for 14 or 15 years old. The actor who play Mikael Blomquist was NOT attractive. In the book he had charisma and women fell for him left and right.The story jumped all over the place and had I not read the book, I would have had no idea what was going on. So much was left out. The book is long enough they could have done what was done with The Hobbit and made it multi-part.In short, a huge disappointment.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A fantastic crime and punishment film TRILOGY,"In the name of ""National Security"" secret groups in any country on this earth have Carte Blanche to power, secrecy, abuse and manipulation. That is the backdrop of this old fashion crime mystery drama or if you prefer: thriller. Buried deep into the dark past of then political rulers of Sweden, almost everyone who were in power from the Prime Minister to clergy, kept and protected the crimes of a former Russian spy and his gang of thugs involved with sex trade, murder and violence against women.A secret agent is a dangerous job, even more so if the spy happens to be a sadistic wife- beating husband and your principal enemy is his own daughter who at only 12, did stand up to him and hurt him really, really bad.The star of the show is Lisbeth Salander the eccentric, antisocial, introverted, abused and very early-matured young girl impeccably played by Noomi Rapace. Lisbeth is seeking judgment or revenge in her own way, she does not trust anyone except Plague the hacker and Blomkvist, the Millennium investigating journalist.Written by the amazingly talented and promising late Swedish writer Stieg Larsson who prematurely died in 2004 of a heart attack at only 50. Sexual violence against women was his theme in this Millennium Series of best selling novels, first published in Europe in 2006. Unfortunately he could not enjoy the remarkable success of his book publishing and now the sensation of the 3 outstanding films called: The Stieg Larsson Trilogy.David Fincher is directing (2011) the American version of the first film The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. I can't think of any reason to re-make this extraordinarily executed and flawlessly acted Swedish-Danish produced film, but since Mr. Fincher is involved, whom I respect, and Scott Rudin producing, it can't go wrong and I can't wait to for the release date to be published.It is a fantastic crime and punishment film with fascinating characters that have human dimensions, they are almost real and it feels like they could be your co-workers or neighbors.""There is something rotten in . Stockholm"" is how I would subtitle the three films and recommend to discover for yourself, what is that rotten thing, by embarking and enjoying this ride that never stops surprising. Watching all three films one after another, for me it was an unforgettable film experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Outstanding,"It seemed to go on forever but I wanted it to. I found the plot and mystery particular and new, and more than anything realistic in its story telling. I like the main female character for her silent thinking women scenes. I heard something on NPR that compared her to Bella from Twilight, and it is simply not true. Lisbeth is a new breed of female characters, she stands her ground silently and although is victimized she still has the will to fight back without feeling sorry for herself.The actress does an excellent job in transforming into this cold character, but she still maintains the intrigue into the character.Even with that in mind the characters are hard to connect to and even harder to completely understand, for these are not your typical heroes or heroins, rather they are just brilliant people who live in the situation of circumstances.Overall this film is a good reflection on the popularity of the book series (something I brought and will be reading soon).",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Well worth a look,"Compelling performances by both lead characters in this remarkable Swedish thriller. Wonderful character development between the vulnerable but relentless investigative journalist Mikael and the woman he is forced to befriend, the secretive and resourceful rebel Lisbeth, add another dimension to the uncomplicated and believable plot development as they both work together to solve the mystery of a woman who disappeared many years earlier. And get ready for a few surprises along the way.Refreshing in that unlike many movies coming from Hollywood these days, the plot is not stretched to the limits of credibility.Released at about the same time as Polanski's equally outstanding The Ghost Writer, both of these superb films should be a lesson to Hollywood on how to produce a good thriller.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Dark but compelling,"This is the Swedish-language film adaptation of the first of the three so-called ""Millenium"" crime novels (titled ""Men Who Hate Women"" in the original) penned by the Swedish crusading journalist Stieg Larsson and published only after his premature death to astonishing worldwide acclaim. The eponymous young anti-heroine is the tattooed and pierced ace hacker and bike rider Lisbeth Salander, brilliantly portrayed by Noomi Rapace, who becomes the accomplice of middle-aged, disgraced investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist). Together they work on a crime four decades old: the disappearance of Harriet Vanger from a gathering on the island owned by the powerful and dysfunctional Vanger family.This is a much colder and darker Sweden - both physically and metaphorically - than the open and tolerant society that we usually imagine and often makes for uncomfortable viewing, especially in scenes of sexual violence. Yet we have no choice but to watch because the narrative is so compelling and twisting and we want to know how the unlikely pairing of Mikael and Lisbeth will work out almost as much as we need to discover who is behind all the sadistic murders and how retribution will be delivered.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

You think Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is just hype?,"I deliberately resisted reading the whole book before watching; I read enough chapters to love the book, but avoid clouding my judgement of the film. I was hoping for another Swedish gem, something I could enjoy as much as I loved Let The Right One In (not the remake).The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (""Män som hatar kvinnor""), was directed by Niels Arden Oplev and based on Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy. I loved the story telling within the film, the tale itself is irresistible, as is the heroine Lisbeth Salander (played by Noomi Rapace). But again that is mainly credit to the book, not necessarily the filmmakers.I admit the film was atmospheric, held my attention, and the story seduced me. But some chunks of the tale felt like they were included only to appease the book's fans. For example, we probably didn't need such routine intervals of Lisbeth's past. Her past is vital of course, it grants context, but so much of it added nothing to the plot, and felt like it was there just to break the pacing between sub-plot and main-plot.We could have instead been teased with briefer hints and flashes to her past. But I suppose they wanted to find a balance between her tortured past and tortured present. It felt too prescribed, too calculative, trying too hard to force us to see everything of what she is, rather than letting us interpret. I suppose I found it mildly patronising.I was not offended by the more graphic scenes, which I won't reveal as I don't like spoilers. I actually liked the fact that she was portrayed as a strong, independent female. Her dynamic with the journalist Mikael Blomkvist (played by Michael Nyqvist) was effective, and there wasn't anything startling wrong with the film. It just wasn't everything I had hoped for.I should refer back to the film I mentioned before. Hoyte Van Hoytema was responsible for the cinematography in Let the Right One In, his style is subtle but irresistible. Whereas The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, despite not being poorly filmed, certainly had no distinctive style or anything visually new to offer.I think the girl With the Dragon Tattoo is living proof that the books are always better than the film. But I am glad they made it into a film, because it means more people are encouraged to read the books, which I have found to be excellent. I would recommend watching this film, but don't do so if you're expecting something groundbreaking or revolutionary.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Watch the movies first!,"Any book will be better than the movie - 99 times out of 100. This trilogy would be the rare exception. I'd heard that ""The Girl"" stories/movies were awesome, so I finally did watch the first movie. I am so glad I did. I was able to see what a great story was being told and then I wanted to read the books.If I had started with the book, I probably never would have finished it. The books are, forgive me, almost dull in parts. The author goes in to so much detail, so much backstory, so much minutae of Swedish political history, that they become hard to read. The meat of the stories is excellent, but it is hard to slog through some parts of the books.The real story in the first book ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" doesn't really start until about a third of the way through. This bit of looooong winded backstory is dealt with in a few lines of dialog in the movie. The author uses way too many difficult Swedish street and place names that all but Swedes will not understand. Makes it cumbersome.I like detail, I like backstory, and I like well fleshed-out characters, but believe me, the movie is the way to go FIRST. Then you can appreciate the books and find out all the other details.All of that being said, this is an arse-kicker trilogy of movies.

Entertaining whodunit,"Having never seen any Scandinavian film and living with a Swede while in London several years ago I was curious to see The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Having not read the book and not aware of the synopsis, I started the movie with an open mind and no expectations.I won't cover the synopsis in detail, but the movie follows two lead protagonists. Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist), a mild mannered investigative reporter facing a light 3 month sentence after being framed by following fraudulent documents that were able to expose the Wennerström corporation for illegal activities, and Lisbeth Salander, (Noomi Rapace) a bi-sexual tech savy feisty goth complete with an array of piercings, tattoos and a mountain of emotional and commitment issues brought on by an abusive father.While Mikael is waiting sentencing for forging evidence against the firm, he is being investigated by Lisbeth on behalf of the Henrick Vanger, the patriarch of the wealthy Vanger family. Henrick is doing a background check on Mikael before offering him a job to help find his niece who went missing some 40 years ago. He suspects it is someone in the family...The grim storyline being quite intricate and digestible, forces quite a lot down the viewers throat and certain scenes may be quite disturbing for viewers. The books seems to be very successful so clearly the plot is acceptable and works. The acting was superb and the leads were convincing and had more than enough depth to their characters. Cinematography was excellent and and really enjoyed the Swedish landscapes.Although a slow builder, there was more than enough tension to keep you engaged not only to find the killer, but also to see how the relationships played out.This is the first film by director David Fincher I have seen, but see he has quite a few titles in development inc 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and Heavy Metal. Definitely will keep an eye out.Satisfied and entertained and enjoyed a foreign take on the crime thriller7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

I did think that aside from that, the movie would have been great. I think that the fact that so many people left ahead of us indicated that we were not the only ones who thought that the brutality of at least two of the scenes was too much too handle.

"The first in the excellent Swedish ""Bjorn Ultimatum"".","Lizbeth had a particularly tough childhood. She is introverted and afraid of any intimacy or closeness.Now 24 yet her body resembles that of a teenage boy, wiry and slender. Her face is often covered by lengths of lifeless hair, and often on top of that by a hood drawn close. She has a few more facial piercings than would probably be deemed necessary by mainstream society (the guy who cheated around on Sandra Bullock might like her though), and her attire might best be described as ""Goth casual"".Perhaps not the chick you'd take home to meet Mum for Sunday brunch, but Lizbeth is not a thug or anyone's skanky girlfriend.She is also not helpless. After a random attack in the subway Lizbeth fights back even though she is clearly outnumbered and probably outmatched. In desperation she refuses to yield and grabs a broken bottle, swinging it wildly until the thugs leave, but worse yet is still to come for Lizbeth.After her existing parole officer equivalent fell ill she is informed that she is to deal with a new man. Bossy,manipulative and sleazy, he imposes restrictions on her activities and bank accounts. When Lizbeth informs him she needs cash for a computer he demands ""favours"", then doesn't give her enough cash anyway. Lizbeth goes back to ask for more cash, he repeats his demands and goes a step further, too far.Way too far.Lizbeth's response is cool, calm and calculated, but brutal and immediate. It would be fair to say that the demands on her schedule and finances clear up significantly.Loosely described as a ""researcher/assistant"", Lizbeth is a skilled computer hacker, contracted by those that need Top Secret info but don't mind not knowing how it was sourced. She also benefits from a photographic memory and amazing powers of logic and perception. None of this helps with her people skills though, Lizbeth is still terse, often rude and easily offended.Lizbeth is contacted for help one day by Michael Blomquist, a journalist in trouble for his personal written attacks on a well known politician. The story is a big deal in the media at the time.But we'll get back to that./////////////////Michael is hired by a wealthy recluse named Henrick Vanger to investigate the disappearance and presumed murder of a 16 year old girl some 40 years prior. The girl happened to be a carer of Michael's when he was a little boy, wanting to stay out of the limelight for a while he takes the job and moves into a house on Henrick's estate.Vanger is blunt and forthright, informing Michael that he is sure that the killer is not only still around 40 years later - but is likely a member of his family. Being from Sweden some of Henrick's brothers and other family members had Nazi ties earlier, and they still hold extreme views. Henrick receives a framed pressed flower each year on his birthday from a different point on the globe and is positive he is being teased by the killer, as this was what the young girl Heather did as a child.In the ensuing days Michael meets some of the extended family and members of the local police force, both inform him that he is wasting his time and effort.In one of those photo manipulation things that I am positive can only happen in movies Michael manages to find a significant breakthrough, he also finds a code written by Heather, but is disappointed to find that the code is already well known and that despite best efforts no-one has yet been able to crack it to see what it means.///////////////////////When Lizbeth helps out with the code from afar via email Michael tracks her down and asks for her help. For whatever reason Lizbeth agrees and moves in to the remote home on Henrick's manor with Michael.From here Lizbeth and Michael form an uneasy alliance, Michael is generally a friendly and personable chap but quickly realises Lizbeth reacts quickly and negatively at any attempt at conversation once the topic moves to her.Lizbeth initiates sex but it seems more as a truce making exercise than real intimacy, and once proceedings end she is soon back to her own bed. As they progress through and seem to be moving closer to a solution they become more at ease in each other's company, however Lizbeth is still prone to becoming instantly defensive and withdrawn, and she wants no part in dealing with authority.A major development seems to suggest that they are on the hunt for the perpetrator of a series of murders involving young female victims, and it seems that their investigations might be attracting the attention of those that may want them to cease and desist.//////////////////It must be said that for a while it seemed that there were too many goings on happening concurrently and there was no way to bring them all together, but even at 2 ½ hours this film didn't really drag on too much.Thankfully once the truth is finally exposed and the full story is apparent it all makes sense and falls into place, this isn't so much a whodunit in the standard sense but it was nice to have some satisfactory closure rather than an arbitrary ""well I guess we'll never know"" copout.The investigation serves more as a backdrop for Michael and Lizbeth's relationship as it develops, which allowed tidbits of information about her past and the reasons behind her mental state to be released.Final Rating – 7.5 / 10. Lizbeth is indeed a complicated girl, a magnetic screen presence, even when subtitled.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Currently being remade in Hollywood,"A pretty good adaptation of the excellent first book of a trilogy by Stieg Larsson it is entitled - ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" This Swedish film confusingly renamed as ""Men Who Hate Women"" is currently being remade in English in Hollywood, god knows what they will do with it.There are rumours of George Clooney being cast in the Michael Blomqvist role, hopefully they will cast someone young and good such as Ellen Paige as Lizbeth Salander. Her character is so strong that it will require an appropriately young and talented actress to pull it off.The film differs slightly in plot from the book but only in areas where it progresses the plot and increases the pace of the film.Essentially the story is the same and the dark gripping plot is a refreshing change from those more conventional thriller mysteries that usually have boring two dimensional ""who done it"" detective type characters.I thoroughly recommend this film as a stand alone entertainment experience, it slots into the trilogy as a description of the meeting and early collaboration between the two main characters.The story of the trilogy as a whole centres on the Lisbeth Salander character, the three interlinked stories are full of rounded interesting depth-full characters who interact in a believable and sometimes uplifting way, it also has dark grim stories within the plot and nasty villains who all press Lisbeth Salanders buttons, sparking vengeful reactions that are unexpected and equally intriguing.I recommend not only this film but also the two sequels and all three novels which are all of course packed with additional details.Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace are both excellent in their respective roles these films are unusual also in the respect that there are two leading heroic characters instead of just one.If you like intelligent mystery thrillers you will really enjoy this.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Subtle and very rewarding,"In true Bergmanesque fashion this languid Swedish gem of a movie starts slowly and gradually speeds up to walking pace. But let that not put you off. It's an understated little gem of a thriller that gradually unfolds with a complex and multi-layered story that is packed full of repressed sexual abuse messages.At its core a political activist and writer (Michael Niqvist playing Michael Blomqvist) is hired by an industrialist to solve the 40 year old mystery around the disappearance of a slightly loopy teenage girl. Running simultaneously is the back story of a young super hacker (Lisbeth played by Noomi Rapace). Although a lesbian she gradually falls for, 30 years her senior, Blomqvist.Everything about this movie is subtle, even the fact that at no point in the movie is there any reference to its title, other than in one beautifully shot scene and even then it's almost incidental. The chemistry between Lisbeth and Blomqvist is so delicate you think it will shatter at any second, instead it grows millimetre by millimetre into a great double act. For that one has to applaud director Neils Adren Oplev whose work is unfamiliar to me.It's to be released next year as a Hollywood remake with Daniel Craig replacing Blomqvist in the male lead role but bravely, the studio has stuck with the beguiling Rapace in the title role and =as it's to be directed by Michael Fincher we can expect good things because at the core lies a brilliant story that has been brilliantly written. (in fact in many ways this movie reminded me - albeit in a much lower key way - of Se7en.) It centres around abuse of all kinds, fundamentally sexual, but also racial and religious all wrapped together in a neat package that carries a strong moral and emotional punch and the good news is that the other two books in this series have also been filmed by the same team and are due for release BEFORE Hollywood enters the fray.It's out on DVD now but please choose to watch it the way it was intended.

I mean, most thrillers out there DO thrill, but once the film is over you realize all the movie did was spook you momentarily, and you don't even wanna start identifying and analyzing the various goofs, mistakes and unbelievably stupid twists it took for fear of ending up with pieces of a failure in your hands. Yeah, Hollywood tends to do that nowadays with the so-called thrillers that are spewed out by the week. Thank heavens there are still people around who know how to make a thriller that thrills AND manage to make it a heck of a film, complete with a practically flawless plot, characters to die for and an ending that begs for a sequel. One such film is Niels Arden Oplev's ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"", which I just finished watching and which I love beyond words. And, um, the film's Swedish, by the way...and just as a small side note, I think Swedish filmmakers should all teach Hollywood a lesson or two where thrillers are concerned: in 2008 the Swedish thriller ""Let the Right One In"" wowed audiences worldwide and now comes ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" with equally powerful results. Need I say more? Anyway, the film's about reporter Mikael Blomqvist (Michael Nyqvist) who's been accused of libel to one of Sweden's larger companies because he published an article in the Millennium journal which he couldn't prove afterwards. Before Mikael serves his short sentence in jail, he accepts a job offer from Henry Vanger, the leader of a highly wealthy family, to investigate the disappearance of Harriet Vanger (Ewa Fröling) who mysteriously went missing 40 years ago and whom no reporter or private investigator has managed to track ever since. Henry suspects someone from his large, wealthy family killed Harriet and is bent on discovering the truth before he dies of old age. Henry believes Mikael is the right man for one last go at the search because of the Intel he's received on his private life, a dossier which a highly intelligent, highly pierced and tattooed computer hacker called Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) has managed to built up. Mikael and Lisbeth team up to solve the age-old mystery surrounding Harriet's disappearance and the disturbing family connections that they must uncover before finally reaching the truth.Remember Jonathan Demme's ""The Silence of the Lambs""? A flawless thriller if I ever saw one. Remember what made the mystery and the suspense reach out to us? Flawless leading performances by Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster, that's what. We'll, we have the same exact case with this film. The story is very mysterious, the truths that are being unraveled on screen are nerve-racking, the suspense keeps you at the edge of your seat...but the lead characters, especially Noomi Rapace (whom I'm ready to hand over the Academy Award to) convinces us that it's not just another thriller à la John Grisham, but that there's actual HUMAN, believable characters there in the mix. Lisbeth is a goth, troubled young woman heaving a heavy past on her shoulders, and she turns up the attitude to the max playing out the fearless heroine of the story... but her down-to-earth performance, her multi-layered characterization, her pitch-perfect acting make her Lisbeth character jump out of the screen and touch us, win us over. We soon find ourselves actively rooting for Mikael and Lisbeth, actually CARING about what happens to them and believing every single thing that happens on screen...and all (or most of it) because of her wonderful performance. The film's focus is principally on Mikael, but whenever Lisbeth's on screen she steals the show hands down.The story is extremely well done too. Based on the best-seller by Stieg Larsson, it's the first part of his Millennium trilogy (which he managed to complete before his death, may he rest in peace) and which chronicle Mikael and Lisbeth's adventures. While I was watching the film I kept thinking ""this is the modern version of The Godfather meets Sherlock Holmes"". The Vander family is everything the Corleone family might've been like in the 21st century; they're scary, evil, powerful and degenerate, and each member hides dark, gruesome secrets, and they're all being faced by Mikael and Lisbeth, common people like you and me but extremely intelligent and resourceful. Quite the cinematic mix, don't you think? I heard the sequel, ""The Girl who Played with Fire"" is already out in Sweden, and that gives me something to look forward to. They also tell me that the American remake of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is also underway, and that gives me something to fear. The U.S. just loves remaking the best films from around the world and they always end up destroying them; and I can't live with the idea of someone else destroying Lisbeth Salander. I heard they're thinking of casting Kristen Stewart in the American version; I recommend casting Noomi Rapace instead. Or better, just digitally insert Rapace's scenes into the American version and the film will have a good chance of being saved.Look, the film's excellent. It shines with a special brilliance I seldom see in thrillers nowadays, be them American or foreign, and it's a movie experience I'm bound to remember. I highly recommend it.

Rough stuff,"Noomi Rapace is Lisbeth Salander, ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"" a 2009 Swedish film also starring Michael Nyqvist. The film is based on the first book of the Millennium trilogy by the late Stieg Larsson.Nyqvist plays journalist Mikael Blomkvist, a reporter who broke a story about a well-known businessman, was sued for libel, and lost. He knows he was set up, and he has to wait six months for his sentencing. The executives on his newspaper suggest that he lay low for awhile. A paid assignment comes from a member of the powerful Vanger family, Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube). Henrik is old and frail, and before he dies, he wants to see if Blomkvist can solve the disappearance of his niece forty years earlier. Blomkvist lives in the guest house of the Vanger mansion and gets to work.Soon he realizes that he's not alone -- someone -- Lisbeth Salander -- is hacking into his computer and looking into the case as well - not because she has interest in it, but because she's investigating Blomqvist for the security company for which she works, Merrin Security Inc.Lisbeth is a goth, on probation for a crime we don't learn much about initially. She has been given a new probation officer (called a guardian) who asks for sexual favors in order to grant her money from her account. Despite what she's going through, it doesn't take long for the reporter and the brilliant computer hacker to join forces. They can probably crack the case, but it doesn't seem likely that Blomqvist can ever crack Lisbeth's hard shell. She's a mysterious, pencil-thin, seemingly hard and unemotional woman who won't answer questions about herself.This is an incredible film that despite its gorgeous cinematography, is very dark, filled with mystery, tension, sexual perversion, murder, monsters, and violence, not to mention a few twists to the story.Totally absorbing. I have not seen the American version yet, which I understand is also excellent. The performances in this version are marvelous. Somehow Rapace manages to show that Lisa has some vulnerability, and one really roots for her and doesn't blame her for some of her more aggressive actions.""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" for me was a very raw, intense experience, so I'm not sure I'll see the American version. But I am looking forward to seeing the two subsequent Swedish films from the trilogy. Really excellent, and not recommended for those with a squeamish stomach.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Well worth watching,"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (2009) (Swedish books and movies) I had not read the Swedish book(s). The Steig Larsson books are still best sellers. I watched the movies with my wife who helped me follow the complex plots. The Swedish actors, accents, personalities and interaction are typically European and gritty. Dubbed English and closed captions make the content understandable. The Dragon Tattoo books and movies are complex, violent thrillers. Stop here spoiler alert. These movies depict multiple murders, political intrigue and graphic sexual torture. The movies run 2 to 2 ½ hours but don't drag. Sexual activity is explicit but not erotic. The Swedish author Stieg Larsson began the books as a hobby and later learned their market value. Larsson was a workaholic, ate junk food, was a heavy smoker and died prematurely of a heart attack. The foreign films are well worth watching. Noomi Rapace is excellent as Lizabeth, the tattooed girl. Journalist Michal Bloomkist works tirelessly to solve the crimes. A caring relationship between the two protagonists continues in the books and movies.

That happened to me, it was so exciting that I had to watch them all before going to bed. I've seen about 4000 movies and this trilogy and all the 3 movies are one of the best I've seen.

"If you can survived the first build up story, the movie becomes amazing.","I have to say, the first story, the build-up of this movie was ridiculously boring, HOWEVER, the second story of this movie was very, very strong. The beginning of the movie the first half was really slow and boring. I thought it was going to be a waste of another boring investigation film. But, the second half, was golden. The second story keeps you interested and reminds me of the classic I Saw The Devil or The Untold Story... If the first half was as good as the second half this film could have been a 10! But sadly the first half fails to deliver. The ending was kind of heartbreaking, when our main hero the goth chick gets cheated by the main hero, it really kinda made me sad, she was the most likable character of all characters in the movie. The acting was amazing, the filmography was great, and everything works here,l except for that first introduction story, which really just made me bored, and I thought the second half was going to be just as boring, but no, the movie just beings to shine, and it really made the movie a worth watching. If you enjoyed stuff like The Untold Story, I Saw The Devil, Sweet Whip, and such... This is your cup of tea. I want to give a hug to the goth girl, she's the only character I really found loveable.

Great movie........I think not!,"Sorry but I don't understand what the heck people are thinking of, this is a real dire movie, slow paced and bereft of anything worthwhile. I have been in love with foreign movies for over 35 years and I eagerly waited this release having read positive reviews of it left, right & centre but I can't for the life of me see why this film is being lauded in some quarters as a behemoth of a movie, this is really beyond me. It wasn't as if the camera work was striking because it wasn't & it wasn't because the acting was breathtaking because it was turgid, the main actress was totally wooden, hopeless and unconvincing.

A well-cast movie.,"Now I haven't seen many Swedish movies. If I have, I can't remember them. I got out this movie from the local video store and I watched it last night. I was quite surprised how well done this movie was. I was captivated by the excellent performances by the Swedish actors, all of whom I've never seen before. Every actor was the exact portrayal of the character in the book. Henrik Vanger, Lisbeth Salander, the evil Nils Bgurman and others. At first, I wasn't convinced by Mikael Blomkvist; but as the movie moved on I gradually got to him him better and was enthralled by his performance.I didn't know how the movie makers were going to tackle the horrific rape scene or scenes in the book. It was unsettling to watch, but it worked. I nearly had my finger on the fast-forward button but managed to get through the gritty scenes.I've read Stieg Larsson's book, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo about 6 months ago. I loved the book. I thought it would make a great movie but I wouldn't think that a Hollywood blockbuster would do it justice, as this book is obviously set in Sweden. But this movie has done that.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Rapace has injected herself as a major star!,"I remember the days when I used to date a few girls with dragon tattoos. It marked me as a guy that liked Gothic chicks, or something like that. I thought that was unfair stereotypical criticism not only to me but for the young ladies. OK, this never happened (well, maybe a couple of times it did). I was just trying to be a guy with a ""girl with a dragon tattoo"" story, but obviously that intro did not make its mark. Anyways, most have heard of this foreign flick adapted from the late Stieg Larsson's best-selling novel about Mikael Blomkvist, a Stockholm disgraced reporter who is employed by Henrik Vanger, a geriatric Swedish millionaire in order to unravel the mystery of who killed Vanger's beloved niece Harriet. Vanger offers Blomkvist a wealthy fee for his services, the only catch is that the murder occurred 40 years ago and it is not fresh blood anymore (ouch, I hit below the belt on that one, must have been the dragon inside of me), and another catch is that Henrik requests for Mikael to investigate some of the family members of his own Vanger clan. I guess Henrik is of the ""school of thinking"" that a family who is rich together also kills together. However, where this movie gets profoundly skin deep is in the character of Lisbeth Salander, a gothicetta computer hacker who has been able to hack away on Blomkvist's CPU for sometime and eventually ends up teaming with Mikael to investigate the Vanger cold case. Salander is witty, crafty, sexy, sly, sharp, and also has one big ass tattoo on her back. I thought that Director Niels Arden Opley's film adaptation of Larsson's masterpiece literary offering was more than OK but not perfect, but then again Opley could just do so much in incorporating all the intrinsic details from the book to the movie. Screenwriters Nikolaj Arcel and Rasmus Heisterberg probably knew that they were playing with fire in adapting a Larsson book to a movie screenplay, but they actually excelled with a well-knitted movie scribe. I must report that there was no libel in Michael Nyqvist's suave performance as Blomkvist, but it was Noomi Rapace's multi-layered thespian effort in her Lisbeth portrayal what fired me up the most about ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"". Noomi is looming as a major actress! I have yet to see the film's sequels ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" (not based on all the girls who have dated me) or ""The Girls Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest"" (not based on all the girls who have kicked me where it hurts the most), but I doubt those films can reach the achievement of its praise-worthy predecessor. **** Good",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Swedish male-hate propaganda,"Though technically a brilliant thriller, the subcontent of this movie is rather off-putting. You will notice it when you have seen more contemporary Swedish cinema.

"Even at 150 minutes, it still moves quickly for better or worse","What a seemingly insurmountable task to adapt and execute the multiple story lines and brimming of Stieg Larsson's novel ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."" Despite all the slicing and dicing (yet still a two-and-half-hour run time), credit belongs to this Swedish filmmaking team for still managing to replicate the novel's extraordinary pacing.The sacrifice, unfortunately, is tone. In spite of the length, director Niels Arden Oplev makes the film into a full-on sprint. We never get a chance, with the exception of the magnetizing character that is Lisbeth Salander and Noomi Rapace's performance as her, of getting under the story's or characters' skin. We barely have enough time to really understand what kind of a character Mikael Blomqvist (Michael Nyqvist) is before he's engrossed in solving the film's core murder mystery. Yet despite all those complaints, would I or anyone be able to do any better without needing to make the film in two parts? I'd like to think there's a way, but I would not volunteer the man-hours necessary to carve it out.""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" tells the story of a business reporter named Mikael Blomqvist who ends up disgraced when he loses a libel suit thanks to faulty information used in an article trying to take down a billionaire. Needing to lay low, he receives a call from another rich businessman, Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taub), who offers Blomqvist ridiculous compensation to work on solving a 40-year-old mystery involving Vanger's missing niece, who he believes was murdered.Meanwhile, Lisbeth Salander (Rapace) is an information collector (aka hacker) with a troubled past and a number of tattoos and piercings who is doing her own research on Blomqvist and ultimately ends up getting wrapped up in solving the mystery as well.Although iffy on what it cuts from the book and what it alters, the adaptation succeeds at juxtaposing a lot of separate scenes in the novel into one sequence in the film. A common method for combining story lines and sub plots, this is particularly effective in picking up the suspense. As such, the film flows well and the key moments like the end and some pivotal events in the Salander subplot do not lack the impact or intensity that they require.""Dragon Tattoo"" moves at an entertaining clip, but never engulfs you like the novel and that will ultimately lead countless people to declare the books ""so much better."" The themes, tone and depth simply do not exist. I imagine some of the production elements such as cinematography and a better score come with a lack of budget too, so that doesn't help matters. Yet strong performances and entertainment value in this film do echo what made Larsson's book so wildly popular.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Far better than the 2011 remake,"The book was great. It took a while as the book ( like the movie ) bounced between Lisbeth's story and Michael's until they merged.

Both developed the characters well, but this movie went deeper into both main characters. The book made a great deal of Blomkvist's jail sentence, and his preparation to go when they called him ( not the same as out on bail awaiting appeal like we do in the US, but I digress ), and when he did go the whole jail aspect merely evaporated ( I do not consider that detail a spoiler, as it was so trivial ).If you only have time to watch one, I'd recommend this one; the original.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"Arguably as good as, if not better than, David Fincher's American adaptation","""Män som hatar kvinnor"" (""Men Who Hate Women"") is an adaptation of Stieg Larsson's bestselling novel of the same name, which was posthumously published in 2005. Better known to the English-speaking public as ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"", it is the first entry in the Millennium trilogy.This Swedish production, which is set in Sweden, introduces heroine Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) to movie audiences. A young female hacker with a troubled past, she aids disgraced journalist Mikael Blomqvist (Michael Nyqvist) in his investigation into a forty year old missing persons case. The circumstances surrounding the disappearance are mysterious and the facts seem to point to a member of the girl's extensive family as the culprit.The title ""Men Who Hate Women"" is borne out in relation to the central mystery and also in Lisbeth's dealings with her legal guardian. The violence may be a bit much for some to take but it doesn't overshadow the well-constructed detective story that propels the movie's plot.The acting is unquestionably highlighted by Noomi Rapace's performance, which was justifiably nominated for a BAFTA award. She excelled in the demanding role of Lisbeth Salander, working well in tandem with male lead Michael Nyqvist. The supporting cast is uniformly convincing but largely unexceptional.In terms of production values, this fairly modest film can't really be expected to compete with the big budget American version. Nevertheless, it still manages to hold its own. Director Niels Arden Oplev may not have the visual flair of David Fincher but his work here is quite satisfactory on its own terms. Similarly, the music may not be as distinctive as the American version's but it gets the job done.Ultimately, I found that this adaptation of the novel seems to have the upper hand in terms of both casting and storytelling. Either way, both versions are well worth watching for any fan of mysteries or thrillers, not to mention for the stellar performances of their respective leading ladies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Like a punch to the stomach, in a good way","Mikael Blomkvist is a staunch reporter, now facing jail-time for a fabricated exposé on a businessman. His face is everywhere, and he takes a leave of absence from his paper to avoid sullying its name with the scandal. With time before his sentence is carried out and nothing to lose, he agrees to investigate a 40-year-old murder case, where he partners up with a Goth expert hacker, Lisbeth Salander. The duo have an amusing odd couple dynamic, and in general, the characters are interesting and memorable. This is a deeply disturbing, gritty, brutal, dark film(albeit the amount of actual blood and gore is small; the sexual content is strong and plentiful). The thematic of authority figures abusing their power and particularly attacking women(the original title of Men Who Hate Women seems far more fitting than this ""Dragon Tattoo"" stuff, but oh well) is explored well. This has a fantastic pace, the two hour, twenty minute running time flies right by. The mystery is gripping, and it keeps you guessing whilst allowing the viewer to piece it all together as the leads do so. And the investigation isn't made easier by the entire Vanger clan being suspects for the death of, well, one of their own, so they could inherit the empire(and no two of these people can stand each other... so, really, just like any other family). That does bring me to one issue; there are entirely too many people to keep track of, specifically in this mass of potential killers. We can't remember all of them(the one aspect where that is true of this movie, and where I could see this being better as a mini-series), and it feels like a side-effect of this being a novel adaptation(I can't compare the two versions, as I have not read it), since books can spend more time delving into a large ensemble. The humor is bleak and, in a cynical way, satisfying. This has phenomenal acting, particularly by Rapace. Her role is intriguing, and you want to know more about her. This feels really credible(everyone's actions make sense) and realistic. I haven't watched this dubbed, but like I always say on this issue, deal with the subtitles. It's best in the native tongue.

The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo ferociously breathes fire and violence.,"The 'Millenium' trilogy of books is a series that has sold million of copies. A film adaptation was only a matter of time. Fortunately we are presented with an original authentic Swedish perspective which refuses to shy away from the visceral violence that the book bathed in. A disgraced reporter is hired to solve a murder case that has been unsolved for 40 years. He soon gains assistance from a professional hacker, where the two unevenly work together. It's a murder mystery, but what differentiates this from typical crime investigations is the journalistic approach and its characters. There are no elaborate car chase sequences through bustling streets or extensive shoot outs with the eventual culprit. It's more intellectually stimulating than that. Arcel's screenplay succinctly places breadcrumbs, leaving you ample opportunity to attempt to solve the case whilst the two protagonists do the same. This is then accompanied by an unconventional relationship between Lisbeth and Mikael. These two individuals are very different, yet very much alike. Their odd chemistry, and at times provocatively seductive, make them interesting and alluring. Rapace's performance is the stand out. The grunge attire and transformative makeup enhance her dominant performance. Being able to balance the vulnerability of Lisbeth, particularly during the terrifying rape scene, with the aggressive side. Nyqvist on the other hand I thought was bland for the most part, unable to make Mikael an investing character. Although he did become more involving towards the second half, particularly as he gets closer to the culprit. The pace is consistent for this long thriller, that is until the case is solved. The final twenty minutes meander slightly and lose that taut tempo that Oplev had produced. Primarily due to no progression in the story. In saying that though, the vast majority of the film was a gripping mystery that embodied the cold harsh environment of rural Sweden. Very much looking forward to the next chapter!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Superb! Especially the extended versions.,"I've watched these multiple times and they are truly great films.I didn't mind the first US film, but the others were pretty terrible, but then they were based on bad books, so not a great start.It still blows my mind that with the utter garbage being turned out by the film industry these days, no one has thought to do these 3 original films really well,",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Blue Hues and Black Hearts,"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a film that delves into the darkest corners of human depravity with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Directed by Niels Arden Oplev, this Swedish thriller is like a journey into the abyss, where danger lurks around every corner.The plot revolves around journalist Mikael Blomkvist, played by the stoic Michael Nyqvist, who is hired to investigate the disappearance of a young woman from a wealthy family. As he delves deeper into the case, he uncovers a web of corruption, conspiracy, and unspeakable cruelty that stretches back decades.But it's Lisbeth Salander who steals the show, with her piercing gaze and steely determination. Played with eerie intensity by Noomi Rapace, Lisbeth is a troubled young woman with a talent for hacking and a penchant for vengeance. She's like a modern-day avenging angel, swooping down on those who deserve punishment with ruthless efficiency. And yet, beneath her tough exterior lies a vulnerability that adds depth and complexity to her character.The film's atmosphere is as chilling as a winter's night in the Swedish countryside, with each scene bathed in an eerie blue light that lends an air of menace to the proceedings. The cinematography is stunning, capturing the stark beauty of the landscape while also emphasizing the darkness that lurks beneath the surface.And then there's the infamous r*pe scene, which is like a gut punch to the audience's collective conscience. It's raw, brutal, and unflinching in its depiction of violence against women. Some may find it difficult to watch, but it serves as a stark reminder of the horrors that exist in the world and the importance of confronting them head-on. The same can be said about the film, as it doesn't shy away from the darkness of the human soul, but instead embraces it, using it to craft a story that is as compelling as it is disturbing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Wonderful yet challenging film!,"It is always difficult when someone asks you if you 'enjoyed' this movie.. it a wonderfully made film, the casting is superb with Michael Nyqvist and especially Noomi Rapace keeping the suspense incredibly taught throughout. It's a very challenging film at times, it explores some very dark aspects of the human condition. I don't think I could say that I enjoyed this film but I was gripped from beginning to end and very emotionally invested in the characters. Noomi has gone on as we know to do many great things however this was my first exposure to her indomitable skill. Original story (at least for me) stunning casting throughout, great locations, very solid script, just a very very well made film (if a little difficult at times). If you are in any doubt why Noomi's career has been so successful just watch this film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Well-crafted but too dark and violent,"I regret watching this film. Not because it is of low quality but because its message is nothing but ""you should return evil with evil"" and there are some scenes in the film that were so violent that I could hardly watch.OK. I must say that the film is well-directed, well-paced, thrilling, it is a high quality suspense film if you are talking about it in terms of movie making. People can be glued to the screen because of the film made them feel excited.Well, but if you are a person who believes in love and hope and the power of love and forgiveness, you shouldn't watch this film. Because there is little of that. The whole thing, beside investigation and mystery, is about revenge and how you should return violence with violence. It depicts evil and the fruits of evil and no real or true message about how you should deal with evil in this world beside violence. The film implicitly tell us that it's OK to kill, it's OK to beat and torture someone, if that person is already evil. It's OK to kill your father if your father abuses you. It is OK to stand and watch someone die although you can help, because that person is evil. These kinds of things are understandable but they are wrong messages to be sent into this world already full with too much evil and violence.The main character of the film is presented as a woman hero, someone who is very strong, very smart, with a dark and hurtful past. I don't know what's the big deal about the tattoo dragon on her back either. It looks scary to me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Geeky Randy's summary,"Brilliant mystery about journalist Nyqvist taking on one last case before serving a prison sentence and is unexpectedly aided by hacker Rapace who believes in his innocence. The film goes above and beyond with its beautiful scenery, numerous twists and two plots that are equally intriguing—one that involves Nyqvist's character dealing with legal conflicts, and the other that involves the investigation of a woman's disappearance 40 years prior, all while foreshadowing a bigger story with Rupace's character for future installments. The Vanger family does indeed have too many members and too much history for its own good; nonetheless, the film is rarely confusing or boring, and is ultimately executed superbly.***½ (out of four)",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Awkward partnership that works,"This is a invigorating, immersive and raw mystery/thriller that despite the running time had my attention from beginning to end.

And I especially liked the raw aspect of things in this movie and made me personally care about what was going on. The acting is good as well as the cinematography.

Modern-Day Noir Thriller That Pulls No Punches...,"In his study, an elderly man opens a package marked ""Hong Kong."" Inside is a beautifully framed specimen of a pressed flower. He studies it closely, removes his glasses...then begins to sob uncontrollably. If you didn't know what you were watching, you'd think you stumbled into the wrong movie - a Bergmann film, maybe. But this is the deceptive opening scene to THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, a smart, uncompromising thriller that will grab you by your temples, squeeze and not let go until the very end.The elderly man is Henrik Vanger (Sven Bertil-Taube), whose life is about to intersect with two unlikely protagonists and soon-to-become allies.Mikael Blomqvist (Michael Nyquist) is a well-known investigative journalist, who has just been sued for libel by a big-time industrialist, and lost. Not only is he disgraced, but facing jail time. So ""Kalle"" Blomqvist certainly has nothing to lose, when he gets a call from none other than Vanger for the most unlikely of reasons - to help him solve the 40-year old murder case involving his niece, Harriet, whose body disappeared without a trace.And unknown to Mikael, Vanger has had him thoroughly checked out before hiring him. A security company has been dogging his every move during and after the libel trial, and that includes having every bit of intel gathered on him by one of their most well-known 'specialists'...a master hacker and 'researcher' named Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace, who now can be seen in the latest SHERLOCK HOLMES adventure.) TATTOO is all about the circumstances that bring these three diverse characters together, while exploring a tale of twists and turns that also uncovers the darkest recesses of the human psyche. And as with every good noir thriller, it doesn't skimp on all the adult stuff: sexual assault, blackmail, torture, murder...and even worse.Not having read a single one of the books, I am now definitely interested, but not before finishing the film series, which should be excellent if this initial entry is any indication. The cinematography is superb; the dark, brooding score complementary but not intrusive, and director Niels Arden Oplev keeps the action tight, tense and captivating in all the right places.The most remarkable thing of all, though, are the performances of the leads. Nyqvist and Rapace are both outstanding, digging deep into the complexities of their characters (especially Lisbeth, who is not like any heroine you have ever seen in a suspense thriller for quite a while). It's also admirable that they aren't Hollywood-perfect...which has me worried about the David Fincher remake.Because a gunfight or an explosion doesn't happen every five minutes, and it's in Swedish with English subtitles, a lot of people will probably give this a pass. Which would be a terrible mistake, because the story, direction and performances will definitely reward anyone willing to give it a shot, with one of the best 'whodunnits' to come along in years.I think enough of this not just to award it a '9', but also to urge you, dear movie fan, to see this version FIRST, before you plunk down your twelve bucks for the big-budget studio 'makeover.' It's two hours well spent, I promise.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

So so so much better than the English/Hollywood version!,"Didn't know about the original till I read one of the reviews of the 007 version. To be honest, as a Hollywoodish thriller the 007 version wasn't bad on its own. But when I watched the original, just out of curiosity, with the out of sync subtitle, I was totally blown away! Can't believe how much better the original is in comparison, in every aspects of the movie. Guess Hollywood is a business enterprise after all. Subtract some brain and add some adrenaline/spice, you got a bigger box office payback. This seems to have always been the American way, and joe-six-packs around the world seem to love it better!Anyway, when I first saw the copy-cat version, I just thought the lady lead has to be this dark hair Euro girl that I can't remember the name but always her face after seeing her first movie (thought she was french). Could the movie created just for her role alone? Now I know she is Swedish (well, half Spaniard too, surprise!)Without Noomi, this movie simply doesn't work, at least lost big half of the power and attraction.Just glad that I get to see the original AFTER the 007 version.

Liesbeth Salander Forever!,"If you read the books, this film version will not disappoint you nor fail you. First I was very sad that Michael Nyqvist passed on so early. Noomi Rapace fell into Hollywood's radar because of this trilogy when she played the barbarically abused Liesbeth Salander and avenged herself and the very few souls she cared for and when she could she did with pouncing brutality. This is the crowning glory of many Skandikrimi wherein the viewer is not only taken to the cold and isolated region of Sweden where only God knows what one truly does when no one is watching, no matter how rich or reputable a family is. This film is beyond-the-grave brutal and complex. The English version was only limited to Part One ( Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara) mind you that the story is not limited to that one and does not end there. To grind your teeth and self-induce a breakdown the viewer must watch until the end of the third, only then can one piece what happened and who did what in the criminal web. It is also saddening that the author, Stieg Larsson died before completing the fourth manuscript, there's surely still a lot to come from that brilliant mind of his. Any cinematista ( my own word invention) should possess a DVD -book collection of this monstrous masterpiece of a trilogy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Rapace is brilliant,"I finally decided to sit down and watch the first part of the hyped 'Millennium' trilogy..and I'm glad I did. It turned out to be a surprisingly good thriller. A masterpiece compared to all the other thrillers produced in Sweden for the past ten years. They are the main reason why I've avoided this movie for so long. 'Män som hatar kvinnor' (Swedish title - literally means 'Men who hate women') has a good story. It's not that original, but it works. Also, the scenery is nice (Hollywood remake will also be filmed in Sweden). But the two main actors (Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyqvist) are the main reason why I loved that movie so much. (They both got big Hollywood gigs after the success of this trilogy). Rapace is particularly convincing as the hacker.Note: Written in 2010",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
For Pete's Take - The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (Män som hatar kvinnor),"Movie Review by Peter Letso Jr on 4/16/2010Swedish billionaire Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube) is the 82-year-old patriarch of a wealthy, dysfunctional family that lives on a remote island off the coast of Sweden. He has mourned the loss of his niece Harriet (Julia Sporre) every day since she mysteriously disappeared as a 16-year-old, forty years earlier. While he loved Harriet as though she were his own daughter, there is no love lost between Vanger and the rest of his family. He believes that someone in the clan murdered Harriet and is determined to find out whom.Henrik and the town's long-time Detective Lieutenant Morell (Bjom Granath) have tried to solve the mystery since Harriet's disappearance. They desperately seek closure to this case, as their twilight years are upon them.Henrik seeks out Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist), a well-known financial journalist and skilled investigative reporter. Mikael has a big problem of his own, however, having recently been found guilty of libel in a case against a corrupt Swedish industrialist. He is due to report to prison in six months, and Henrik persuades Mikael to use that time to investigate the mystery of Harriet's disappearance.Blomkvist is aided by Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace), a ruthless computer hacker. She too has a shady past, but at 24-years-old is considered an expert in locating missing persons. She is violent, antisocial and possesses a photographic memory. Her tattooed, pierced, punked-out look belies her brilliance and talent.Mikael and Lisbeth form an odd but industrious pair of sleuths. Their painstaking work soon begins to reveal clues about the people, places and events that give shape to the elements needed to solve the mystery.The result is a film that is positively spellbinding. In spite of a multi-layered plot, which spawns several subplots, the story never bogs down. Director Niels Arden Oplev sets a fast pace and yet manages to tell this dark story clearly - quite an achievement given the tale's intricate details. The narrative is compelling, keeping the audience at the edge of its seat. In a literary sense, the story is ""a real page turner."" Mikael and Lisbeth are quite appealing, in spite of their eccentricities and sordid pasts.Cinematographers Jens Fischer and Eric Cress artfully capture the isolation of the island and the cold, Swedish winter. The original score by Jacob Groth nourishes this gripping thriller's many twists and turns.Filmed in Sweden with English subtitles, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is adapted from the first of a series of three books by the late Swedish author Stieg Larsson. Originally titled Man som hatar kvinnor, this hugely popular bestseller won Sweden's Glass Key Award for Best Crime Novel in 2006.The film's two-and-a-half hour running time passes breezily. The fact that it was not submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) for a rating (it contains scenes of nudity and graphic violence, none of which is gratuitous) should not be a deterrent.This film is not to be missed by avid moviegoers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Stieg Larsson write this?,"This is a master work of crime genre. There is a light touch that only a seasoned writer could achieve. There are multiple characters easily maneuvered. The clues are intricate and fall into place in a timely manner. The brutality is achieved like a gourmet meal from a top chef. The dark humor plays throughout along with the ironies. The character of Lizbeth Salander is of an original rendering; she is brilliant with a photographic memory, but also has courage to go after men who hate women. The multi- generational cast could only have been created by a master writer. James Lee Earle Ellroy wrote this book Steig Larsson could never have written this book.

heavy duty torture and sexual violence,"This is a strange movie. Much it is watching people do searches on computers, adjust surveillance cameras, flip dusty ledger pages, and look through old photographs all with deadly intensity with the music signifying every pixel is of deep significance. Then it suddenly flips to scenes of ghastly torture and sexual violence. I had to leave the room. The villains are just so twisted, you can't help but enjoy the poetic justice eventually handed out to them. The heroine is a weird duck. She won't volunteer any information about herself, and she behaves unlike anyone else in film. She is officially mentally ill. I think she is inter-sexed with strong male muscles and female nipples. The film, oddly, has one of the happiest endings I can remember. The film is in Swedish(Danish?) with subtitles. My roommate and I had great fun looking for English cognates. It turns out Swedish (Danish?) is much more like English that I thought it would be. The wintry Swedish (Danish?) countryside reminds me of my home Canada, but it is definitely different.

Excellent Mystery Thriller,"Having now seen all three films, I cannot really say which I preferred, but as it started here, this is a fantastic introduction to Lisbeth, Micke and all at Millennium.There is much suspense, twists and turns, and a plot that keeps building and keeps the viewing experience riveting. I have to say that the acting is fantastic and convincing, as is the directing. I hope to see more of these actors and actresses. I must keep an eye out for other films they have been in or will make, as it is not so easy to see some lesser known Swedish films here in UK.In this particular episode, we learn of related crimes and why possibly Lisbeth is being targeted. Micke is the fearless and determined reporter, even to the point of risking his own life. He is committed to the truth, and reminds me a bit of Mulder's Character in the x files.

Noomi Rapace better than Angelina Jolie,"What a refreshing escape from Hollywood movies! The heroin Noomi Rapace is highly believable, which makes her action scenes incredibly watchable. You just know that this woman is not too different from people you know or see around in Brighton. She is QAQV (quiet and quite violent). It's a real mystery story and it is that, you realize, that demands you focus on each scene. It is a very intense movie so go prepared to stay frozen for 90 minutes. The movie is being remade in Hollywood, but with another actress (from Nightmare on Elm Street) but the calm power of Noomi Rapace cannot be replaced and I would guess that the new version will be (as usual) a poor remake with the most powerful 'indy' scenes removed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

The first of the Stieg Larsson films,"All of us who have read the three Stieg Larsson novels have eagerly awaited the cinematic versions of these riveting stories. The first novel was titled MEN WHO HATE WOMEN, but in English this was changed to THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, due to the fact that the heroine Lisbeth Salander has such a tattoo. Larsson's main theme in his fiction, however, was the horrific abuse of women in Swedish society, which proves that it does not take a burka to reduce a woman to a humiliated state. It has recently emerged in press reports of a forthcoming book about Larsson by an old friend that the formative experience in Larsson's life was a traumatic incident in his teens where he witnessed the rape of a girl he knew by three of his friends, and was too much of a coward to intervene to stop them. He later asked the girl to forgive him, and she refused. He spent the rest of his life seared with guilt over this and his atonement was to write these horrifying exposés of the underbelly of life in modern Sweden. The three novels are known as 'the Millennium Trilogy', after the magazine Millennium of which the hero, Michael Blomkvist, is editor. Larsson himself was editor of a similar magazine, the name of which was Expo, because it did exposés, particularly of the ex-Nazis and Neo-Nazis of Sweden (who figure strongly in this film). Sweden is well known to have been a major 'ODESSA' destination for fleeing Nazis after the War and repository for much of the Nazi gold, and as a left-winger, Larsson campaigned against the Nazis and their sympathisers relentlessly. Many of these people were amongst the women-haters, rapists, torturers and imprisoners of women whom Larsson also wished to expose, as he does in this story. The Swedes have filmed all three novels, and all these films have already been shown there. The first of the series is now available on DVD with English subtitles, soon to be followed by the other two. The DVD of this film contains an important interview in English with the actress Noomi Rapace who plays Lisbeth (she pronounces her name Noomi to rhyme with 'gloomy'), as well as one with the producer. Both are very much worth watching. The casting of the two leads in the film is perfect. Rapace spent a year and a half 'as Lisbeth', making the three films, and apart from being too tall, is otherwise just about identical with the character in the book, to a truly astonishing degree. Michael Nyqvist is also perfect as Mikael Blomkvist. The Swedish films also have authenticity from having been made by Swedes in Sweden. Hollywood is currently doing remakes of all three films, but there is depressing news about that. They have chosen the infinitely boring and uninspiring (not to say highly irritating!) Daniel Craig to play Mikael Blomkvist. He is absolutely not right. Of the three novels, this one is the least interesting, because it is essentially the horrific saga of the dysfunctional Vanger Family, many of whom were Nazis. The most interesting of the three novels is the last one, which exposes the fantastic corruption of a rogue faction within the Swedish security services. That is the scariest of the books because of its wider implications. The intensely neurotic and introverted Lisbeth Salander is a remarkable literary character creation, a kind of autistic computer genius with a photographic memory who solves advanced mathematical equations in her head for fun. What we learn about her background and vicissitudes is such a horrifying revelation of some of the unpalatable aspects of Sweden that it puts you right off that country, and if it weren't for my faith in Selma Lagerlof, I might think the country should be shunned as a consequence. A great deal of material from the novel is necessarily omitted from the film, which contains very little about the character and story of Wennerstrom, for instance. One of the finest performances is by Peter Andersson, as the evil and sinister Nils Bjurman. He is so convincing, one wants to attack the screen. Sven-Bertil Taube is just right as the elderly Henrik Vanger. As regards the forthcoming Hollywood versions of these films, there are so far two sparks of hope: Erika Berger will be played in the Hollywood versions by Robin Wright (formerly Robin Wright Penn), and she is a very good choice indeed for that character, better in fact than the Swedish actress. And Stellan Skarsgard will play Martin Vanger, which he will do brilliantly. If he were younger, he would be the perfect Mikael Blomkvist, but he is 59, 17 years older than Craig, and so it wouldn't work. The casting of Lisbeth has not been announced, and we all must wait nervously for this casting decision. I suppose the little lost waifs Winona Ryder or Jennifer Jason Leigh would have been suitable when they were younger, especially the latter, as she was able to be tough as nails whilst at the same time being as fragile as a cobweb (never knew how she did that!). Let's hope producer Scott Rudin can think laterally and come up with some brilliant inspiration or even find an amazing unknown. He has a chance to 'go for gold', so let's hope he makes it. Of course, they could always cast Noomi Rapace, as she speaks English and knows more about Lisbeth than anybody alive. Why not? All three Swedish DVDs are already on sale with German subtitles, but only this one so far with English subtitles.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Good thriller movie,"The feel of the movie is similar to that of the first ""Les rivières pourpres"" film. Same high class isolated community, a mystery and some people investigating it. Based on the first book in the Millennium trilogy, written by Stieg Larsson, it follows an investigative reporter and a girl hacker trying to find the killer in a 40 years old murder.The plot is complex and each character has their own definite personality and story. The actors are playing well, too, even the ones in secondary roles, which adds to the overall atmosphere. I am not a big fan of the mystery thriller, but I enjoy the occasional well done film and this is clearly one of those. Given that the movie will be remade by the Americans, with actors like Daniel Craig and Carey Mulligan, other people have thought the same as me. I would still recommend seeing the Swedish version first, though.Bottom line: really good mystery thriller, the only one in the trilogy that can be watched standalone, I think. The other two don't bother presenting the characters and are obvious continuations of the same story. There will be a US remake in 2012, but I say you should not wait for it and watch the Swedish version.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is an outstanding serial killer mystery-thriller, and one of the best films of 2010.","Based on the immensely popular novel of the same name by the late Stieg Larsson, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is an outstanding serial killer mystery-thriller, and one of the best films of the year. The first part of the ""Millennium Trilogy"", Dragon Tattoo precedes The Girl Who Played with Fire, and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, both of which are already made into films in Sweden. Such is the anticipation for their release outside Sweden that many filmgoers are beginning to hop around in excitement.Directed by Niels Arden Oplev, who works mainly in television, Dragon Tattoo is a remarkable effort in feature length filmmaking. Oplev shows exquisite skill in crafting a mystery-thriller that is never formulaic, expressing the desire to deliver a picture whose characters are more important than the story, which in itself is already fascinating to begin with. He takes his time to flesh out the two lead characters by providing viewers with more than a summary of their current life situation, and slices of their past that they could not forget, giving the leads an uncommon depth.Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) and Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) are the two leads. The former is a disgraced financial journalist who is waiting to serve his jail term in six months' time. The latter is a genius computer hacker who is sexually taken advantage of by her sadistic caretaker. The first half of the film documents these two characters separately, only bringing them together much later. By that time, the film's murder mystery has become so engrossing that it threatens to overshadow its characters. Yet, it does not.The story follows Mikael who is paid to pursue an unsolvable case of a young woman who disappeared forty years ago from an island. Through old-school journalistic techniques, and with the help of Lisbeth's prowess in IT, he uncovers a chilling cultish plot by a Nazi sympathizer who rapes, tortures, and kills women. When the real identity of the killer is revealed at the end, it may not be much of a shocker. However, it is the journey towards that revelation that is integral to the haunting cinematic experience as created by Oplev.Dragon Tattoo is frightening and it crawls deep under your skin. Mikael sticks loads of old, black-and-white photographs of suspects on his wall to organize his thoughts and try to find links or clues that would shed light on the mystery. Oplev shoots extreme close-ups of these photographs, as if they are blown up to the proportions of a theatre screen. Looking at them gives a creepy feel akin to literally staring into the eyes of a cold-blooded murderer. Repeated exposure to these photos build suspense, of which it cumulates in the film's most unnerving sequence when Mikael breaks into a suspect's house to find criminal evidence.Dragon Tattoo clocks in at about 150 minutes, which makes the film a long (but still satisfying) ride. However, it turns rather draggy in the final twenty minutes as Oplev tries to tie up all the loose ends. The film has been such a competent example of storytelling that cutting the entire final segment would not have caused any problems other than irritating a handful of Larsson's more vocal fans.David Fincher, the reputable director of Seven (1995) and Zodiac (2007), both of which share eerie similarities with the style and content of Dragon Tattoo, is set to direct the Hollywood remake of Oplev's film. I usually condemn any news of Hollywood remaking foreign language pictures, but Fincher's Dragon Tattoo is something I would really love to see.SCORE: 8.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
An engaging dark thriller,"¨He was a man who hated women¨ Perhaps this quote is what better summarizes the movie which is based on Stieg Larsson's best selling novel ¨Män som hatar kvinnor¨ which is the first book of the Millennium trilogy he wrote. The title has been translated in English as The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, a very attractive one, but not as strong as the literary Swedish translation which means The Men Who Hated Women. Larsson died in 2004, before these books were published and became worldwide sensations, but the trilogy was complete and once they were published his first book sold over 8 million copies. Now, his books have been turned into movies and these films have become a great success overseas. A Hollywood remake of these movies are sure to come our way soon, but it would be better to check out the Swedish versions first which were all released last year. The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo was directed by danish filmmaker Niels Arden Oplev (who directed the danish award winning film We Shall Overcome) and the novel was adapted for the screenplay by Nikolaj Arcel and Rasmus Heisterberg. The film tried to stay faithful to the novel although there were some changes, but the dark mood and the violent scenes remain. Many people were turned down because of the strong violent and sexual scenes in the film which were very realistic and gruesome, but I think they really helped set the tone of the film and explain the characters motivations. The location of the film also contributed to the overall dark mood and helped build the suspense and tension. This was just one of the best suspense thrillers of the year and reminded me of Fincher's masterpiece, Se7en.Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) is a journalist who works for Millennium magazine in Sweden and has recently been sued by a business tycoon named Hans-Erik Wennerstrom (Stefan Sauk) for libel against him. The truth is that Blomkvist has been framed and the proof he had against Wennerstrom was false so he is sentenced to three months in prison. He has six months before beginning his sentence and he receives a job proposition from Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube), a former CEO of the Vanger group, who lives in an isolated island along with the rest of the members of the rich family. Henrik has hired Mikael because he wants him to investigate what happened to his disappeared niece, Harriet, who he believes has been murdered by someone in his family forty years ago, although police officers haven't been able to find any clues over the years. The reason Henrik hasn't given up looking for the killer is that every year on his birthday he receives a portrait with a flower as a gift from different parts of the world that he presumes is from the killer. He says that the killer has to be someone from the family because there was an accident on the bridge the day Harriet disappeared and no one could get in or out of the island on that day so it couldn't be an outsider. Henrik loved Harriet very much and took good care of her because her mother was irresponsible and her father died an year before she vanished. Henrik's brothers were all Nazi sympathizers during the War and he suspects one of them is the killer. Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) is a computer hacker who is pretty good at what she does, but is a very troublesome teenager who has very poor social skills. She was hired by a security agency to follow Mikael during the trial and became very interested in him even after her work was done. She hacks into his computer and begins helping him with the case. Together they decide to dig back in the past, but someone isn't too happy about it.The film works as a very dark and intelligent thriller. I think the film was adapted very well from the suspenseful novel and that the movie has a darker Agatha Christie feeling too it. There are a lot of mysteries to be solved and the lead characters are interesting. Noomi Rapace is the true star of the film and she carries this movie brilliantly as her character is probably the most mysterious of them all, but we begin to understand her motivations as the film progresses and we get glimpses of her past. She gave a terrific performance and her very flawed character still makes for a hero who we sympathize with because she is a victim. I really enjoyed how the movie unfolded and how the mystery was built and resolved. I was expecting for the movie to have an open ending because I knew it was a trilogy, but I was surprised to find out that it actually had a decent closed ending. I really enjoyed this movie and am looking forward to seeing the sequels.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Awesome,"this is by far one of the best foreign films I've ever seen. i love Noomi Rapace and she is very talented and very pretty. I'm looking forward to seeing her in the next Sherlock Holmes film. i think she will do a great job. after she did nail this the role of Lisbeth Salander. I bet when she met the producers for this film she must have said this or should have said this: Bitches, i know i can be Butch, Badass and play a woman doesn't take Bullshit. I'm very horny for this role and I'm gonna go ALL the way. Im gonna learn kick boxing, cut my hair, pierce my self and dress like in goth.

Most Engaging,"Mikael Blomkvist (Nyqvist) a convicted (of Libel) financial journalist is hired to find out what happened to Harriet Vanger (Froling) 40-yrs ago. Harriet disappeared and there has been no trace of her since. Computer hacker Lisbeth (Rapace) hacks into Mikael's computer and provides clues to help solve the mystery. Mikael has 6-months before he goes to jailI know Hollywood is about to do the American remake of this film, but if you want to see a really engaging and well done story by actors who deserve Oscars, then go get this one. There are sub-titles, but they are short and not at all distracting. However, of course, if you know the Swedish language then the sub-titles would probably be a distraction.This is probably the most engaging mystery thriller I have seen since The Ghost Writer. And, as you may have heard, the book and the movie are an international hit. We are talking 2.5-hrs long and you wish it were longer. When the Hollywood version comes out you can see it again and compare.Both leads are terrific, but you cannot take your eyes off a very pretty Noomi Rapace when she is on the screen, and I do hope her tattoos are washable. She steals the show. She is one of those actresses who can say a lot with her eyes as well as her actions.The cinematography is excellent. Good lingering shots of some really beautiful landscapes and I must mention a terrific shot of a big, beautiful, curvy, white bridge when Mikael and Lisbeth take a ride to investigate more clues. It's beautiful but scary (well, for me anyway). You'll see if you do the Swedish version.What was also enjoyable was that the music, while excellent, didn't rush the action on the screen. The dialogues were somewhat understated and this gave them more credence, honesty and power. Even though the actors spoke Swedish, you could feel the impact of the dialogues. Simply great.There is some sex stuff. Lisbeth is forced to orally service her guardian, there is a rape scene, and another sex scene.Overall, a very engaging mystery and you don't want it to end because you really like Mikael and Lisbeth, especially Lisbeth. Now, I can't wait for the Hollywood remake. How good is that?Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes. Nudity: Yes. Language: Yes, in sub-titles",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Tough, rough and totally worth it","One of the stronger films, that the Scandinavians have produced in recent years. And I must admit- one of the best (if not the best) movie that I've seen lately.""Girl with a dragon tattoo"" definitely has some rough scenes and certainly can't be called ""light Hollywood-like entertainment"", but that's one of the things that make this film so particularly appealing.It's done rather simply, it isn't flashy. But the scenery itself is beautiful enough, and the actors have a certain look to them, a different approach to acting- those things combined create a fresh, vibrant experience.I wouldn't recommend this film if you're looking just for fun, light, relaxing evening movie. However, it isn't exactly the regular usually depressing and mentally demanding European film either.

Movie: good.  Book: Unbelievable.,"This was a good movie, very watchable and interesting. But the book was unbelievable and a lot is left out (probably out of necessity because there are just so many nuances/plot layers in the book).The acting was very good - the lead actress was really perfect for the role.While there were some brutal scenes, it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be as I can be on the squeamish side.I highly recommend this movie, and the book is among the best I've ever read.

Worth watching,"I usually like to read the book before seeing a film, but on this occasion, I saw the film first, and did not know anything about the plot prior. I was really pleasantly surprised with the story, the pace and the acting. I thought that Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander was outstanding. She was a likable heroine, dark, broody and smart. Michael Nyqvist as Michael Blomkvist was charismatic and surprisingly sexy in the lead male role. I felt a real connection to both characters. I have since read the book and found the film in retrospect to be a good portrayal of the original written story and for once, the cast of the film suited exactly my image of the characters in the book. It is a smart film with a compelling thriller story and definitely worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"A tremendous, multifaceted film that deserves a cinema viewing.","The first of a trilogy based on Steig Larsson's bestselling novels, Dragon Tattoo is a macabre, yet fascinating, story that will stick you for a long time. Scribes Nikolaj Arcel and Rasmus Hiesterberg have successfully transferred the intense content from book to script, complete with interesting, multi-layered characters, ambiguously intriguing sub-plots and a highly-intelligent and mature theme – all of which demand your undivided attention. The complex plot will be most appreciated by those who don't mind thinking through a movie whilst those who just want to switch off may struggle to keep up.Danish director Oplev treats his material with the utmost respect. Every shot is crafted meticulously, nothing in the frame is filler. Every word has importance, every look a meaning. The hard-to-swallow moments are handled with such care that their impact is strengthened, causing some scenes to be very difficult to watch, despite nothing overtly gratuitous being shown on screen. It's the lingering looks or the animalistic sounds that get under your skin, it's the malevolent sneer of one particularly evil character before he commits a heinous crime that'll get you angry. But this is Oplev's objective. Sexual abuse, murder, abduction, torture – these aren't issues that are meant to be brushed aside, no matter how uneasy it makes you feel.Getting most of the critical plaudits so far has been Noomi Rapace and it's easy to see why. Her gravitas performance as the complicated Lisbeth is filled with subtle nuances and unspoken feeling. Rapace manages to beguile us with her busy eyes; something is always going on behind them and we can't help but wonder. But if Lisbeth is Dragon Tattoo's Joker, then Blomkvist is its Batman and Michael Nyqvist does a solid job in the less-meatier role, shrouding Blomkvist in restrained emotion that adds an extra level of interest.This Swedish film is a tremendous, multifaceted drama / thriller that deserves a viewing at the cinema.4.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Nordic suspense,"Everything about Niels Arden Oplev's ""Män som hatar kvinnor"" (""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" in English) is totally new to me. I had never heard of Stieg Larsson's novel, let alone what the plot what. That made the film even more of a treat. Not only for the suspense, but for the idea of how a young Goth woman uses her computer smarts to help an embattled journalist solve a forty-year-old murder in a Swedish town. The movie also incorporates the history of the Nazis in Sweden (although that country avoided involvement in WWII).It is just amazing how they let the story evolve. I couldn't have come up with something that clever if I'd tried. I really liked it when Lisbeth teaches that one guy a lesson! But above all, this is definitely one that I recommend. Every Swedish movie that I've seen knows how to get every aspect right, and this one adds to that number.I noticed that some of the Swedish phrases sound exactly the same as in English. Of course, they are both Germanic, so it makes sense.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
So worth seeing!,"I was hesitant to see this film, since I loved all of the books so much. I was afraid that the film would be a big disappointment. No! This is a great film, although it seems to me that without having read the books, it might be difficult to ""get"" everything.Another concern was the amount of violence that might be portrayed on screen. Again, no problem. It could not have been done better--only enough is shown so that you know exactly what is going on and can feel the anguish. But there is no gratuitous or unnecessary violence shown. Kudos to the director for making great choices and to the actors for their brilliant portrayals.The casting is superb. I know that some people do not like to see films with subtitles, but I am really wondering if the American version will in any way be able to even come close to the beauty and brilliance of this film.My recommendation is to read the books and then see this beautiful and haunting film, which provides another way to experience this intense, idealistic and inspiring story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Excellent thriller,"This superb cinematic adaptation of the novel captures all of the intense drama and intrigue of the main story while justifiably (and mercifully) abridging the details of the rather mundane and yawn-inducing narrative frame that sets up the central plot. The film, however, is rather long (over two and a half hours), but it definitely rewards the time investment—the performances are excellent, the story is engrossing, and the plot graphically illustrates the original Swedish title of the film (""Men Who Hate Women""). I suspect that the length of the film, combined with the need to read subtitles (along with many Americans' cinematic chauvinism), explains why most Americans will not see this movie but will instead wait for the altogether unnecessary American remake (starring Daniel Craig). Their loss. ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" is one of the best intelligent thrillers of the last few years.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
fantastic trilogy,I've seen all of these movies and must say it was a great set to watch. The reason that is the start.of my review here is because when I was deciding to undergo the trilogy I was unsure if it was going to be worth it. Not everyone can sit through the subtitled movies for one reason or another but I was glued to the screen and was able to keep plenty of focus on the quality film. I don't want to spoil so I will just say each movie is like a Bourne movie but these show right where the other left off and I believe You could watch one without all three but I wouldn't choose that route. Carve out some time and watch great foreign films. Each is over 2 hours so it might take a few days but well worth it. Cheers to Swedish film.,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Went way too long, too pretentious","Slow paced film, a wanna-be hybrid of Euro and American cinematography. The acting is believable to a certain extent and the motivation of the characters seems to be supported by the plot and their character development, with some exceptions. The female character is unlikely to be so savvy at her research abilities at such a young age. The build up of the ""guardian"" of the female character is flat and merely designed for the audience to hate him so that all feel relieved when ""he gets what he deserves."" No sense of relief for the viewer at that scene though, only disgust at the lowly and despicable scene of violence. The female is disproportionately and unbelievably powerful in solving the problems of the main protagonist - both intellectually and physically. Along those lines the movie follows the Hollywood trend of the last years ""females rule"" - smart, independent women in their early 20s, who fix the mishaps of sturdy, well framed, but somewhat stupid men, and who leave to the lady to get what she wants. The only difference is that the woman in the Swedish flick is not a PhD, but a rebel with a tattoo the size of her body. The plot does develop in a logical sequence and has some twist and turns. However, they come way too slow to keep you interested and on the edge of your seat. The story telling is OK with the exception of when the story moves to other, far-off locations. There is no transition or any scenes to show that the protagonist goes to a foreign country, for example. Unless you're a fanatical fan of the Euro ""cinema"" -- not worthy the long two and a half hours.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"This trilogy is the most exhilarating thing I have ever seen, watch it now!!!!!","It's hard to put into words how these movies make you feel. I just finished watching the third one and my life is pretty much changed. If you get the chance, please PLEASE watch these movies. I could not stop thinking about this movie the entire day after I saw it. I just kept wanting more. Then I came to this wonderful website (GO IMDb!) and found out that the director, in all of his wonder and glory, made all three movies in the same year! Bravo, bravo good sir.So if you want a trilogy that is completely and effortlessly unique, that will keep you strapped to your seat or whatever it is you're sitting on, and that will take you for the most intense cinematic roller-coaster I personally have ever experienced.. go watch them. Like now.P.S. I also noticed that we, the great United States, are going to re-make these films in 2011. I find this absolutely outrageous! There is NO way they can top these films. Take it from a film student and seasoned movie watcher, these films are masterpieces that stand on their own.. it would be wrong to try to make them into blockbusters for $$$. Just wrong.And if you still don't believe me, take ""Let Me In"" for example, the new Americanized re-make of a perfectly good Swedish? film ""Let the Right One In"". The Swedes sure know their stuff because that film was the single greatest vampire film I've ever seen hands down. It's beautifully simple and intensely thrilling. I refuse to watch our version because it isn't even a movie made about the original Swedish book, its a re-make of the movie! So unnecessary! I fear that the same thing will happen with this little gem, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Good start to the trilogy,"First of all, I haven't read the books yet, so I'll definitely read them, now that I've enjoyed all 3 films. First of all, Michael Nyqvist, reminds me of Liam Neeson, very handsome actor and he excellently played his part of journalist, Mikael Blomqvist, with great strength and emotion, and of course, not to mention, the real main character, Lisbeth Salander, also very well played out by Noomi Rapace. Lisbeth is a computer hacker who manages to break into journalist Mikael Blomqvist's laptop computer. When she discovers that he's working on a mystery about a young girl's disappearance in the mid '60s, she helps him out by sending him clues. But when Mikael discovers that Lisbeth's been sending him clues, he figures out how to track her down by her emails, and pay her a visit. Eventually, the two decide to work together on the mystery. Together, in the first 2 films, their screen chemistry really mixes very well. The unfortunate flaw about their relationship is due to her unpleasant childhood, Lisbeth is fully unable to commit herself fully to Mikael. All three films have lots of twists and turns, even some surprises to make you jump out of your seat, or couch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
ClassicThriller with Modern Content,"The Novelist Stieg Larsson died in 2004, where none of his ""Millennium"" trilogy has been published yet. There was a tragic story that I found behind the making of those books. When Larsson was 15 years old, he witnessed the gang rape of a young girl. He never forgave himself for failing to help that poor girl at that time. The girl name was Lisbeth. Thiz movie is the first adaptation of those trilogy books. Sometimes I find myself enjoying so much pleasure by watching European movies like thiz Scandinavian movie. The movie is filled with splendid cinematography. I have ever thought that High Definition (HD) Camera would not be able to accomplish thiz kind of remarkable views. I was wrong, many nowadays Directors are still able to create a great nuance with precise treatment through their HD Cameras, sometimes even better. The movie is directed by Niels Arden Oplev. The story tells about the troubled journalist Mikael Blomkvist has to work side by side with a genius punk Gothic hacker, Lisbeth Salander in order to solve a mystery about a missing young girl named Harriet, for the event that had occurred 40 years ago, upon the request of a billionaire industrialist, Henrik Vanger. I have to mention that Sven-Bertil Taube has made a solid performance as Henrik Vanger. Michael Niqvist is very convincing to create his dual side character as Mikael Blomkvist. And surely, the most memorable performance belongs to Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander. I realize that those characters are so difficult to play especially for the two main characters, Blomkvist and Salander because of their complicated motives and backgrounds. I simply called thiz movie as classic thriller with modern contents. Classic which makes us pays attention to clue by clue to get closer to the hidden villain. It is what classic thrillers do. Modern which floods with audacious elements such as the anti-hero characters, ironical sexual abuse scene, unusual moral conflict and many more. I heard that next year, they will remake thiz movie into Hollywood version. My opinion is don't expect too much, even though the Director will be David Fincher who is capable to translate dark tone into intriguing crime thrillers like thiz, he had already proved that through ""se7en"" (1995), ""Fight Club"" (1999) and ""The Zodiac"" (2005). The newest James Bond, Daniel Craig will be the main figure as Mikael Blomkvist and Rooney Mara (""The Social Network"" {2010}) will be played as Lisbeth. I think no matter how hard they will try. Thiz Swedish movie has already set up the bar so high and seems undefeated at thiz time.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Can't Wait to Compare,"The Swedish version of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is so good that it presents a serious challenge to the forthcoming American remake. It's difficult to imagine that Rooney Mara (whom I've never seen in anything) can compare with Noomi Rapace as the damaged, violent, brilliant computer hacker who is as much at the center of the movie as the lead male, Michael Nyqvist (playing Mikael Blomkvist, the temporarily disgraced journalist employed to determine what happened many years previously to the young niece of a wealthy industrialist),It will also be interesting to see how Hollywood handles the violent and explicit sex scenes that go much beyond anything Hollywood has shown as well as the gore that is as savage as any I've seen in a film not about the Holocaust. Don't wait for the American film to see the Swedish version. It's exceptional.Having seen the American version, I can now say that the Swedish version is much better, largely due to the performance of Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth. However, Mikael Blomkvist is also better than Daniel Craig. There is nothing remotely Swedish about Craig -- and this is a story which takes place in Sweden. As to the sex scenes, they are not QUITE as violent and explicit as in the Swedish film, but they come close enough. However, the American film has another serious defect. It simplifies the complicated plot of the novel and, in doing so, makes some things obscure that are perfectly clear in the Swedish film. I regard that as a loss.I wonder the other two films in the trilogy will also be duplicated in the U.S. and, if so, how close they will come to Stieg Larsson's achievement.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Skip it (just the most minor of spoilages below),"The movie does an excellent job of remaining true to the book. If you liked the book, you'll might be able to overlook the ugly cast, crappy filming, and wooden acting. If you haven't read the book, you'll be bewildered since the movie is disjointed and the deux ex machina grows tiresome (just as it did in the novel).For most of the movie, the filming looked amazingly like what you'd expect from a Lifetime made-for-television flick (the scene where the protagonist is running for his life in the woods comes immediately to mind). The acting was on par with a television production as well. Tori Spelling would have been more credible in nearly every role. Some of the scenery was nice, and I like how he filmed the various bridges they drove back and forth over.I can give Oplev credit for one significant feat: he has single-handedly proved that there are some butt-ugly Scandinavians! Michael Nyqvist could probably beat Tommy Lee Jones in the Worst-Acne-Scarring-Evah contest. Noomi Rapace has the body of Iggy Pop with breasts, and one facial expression. One.

The exhilarating movie grips you like how a good book will,"No, this reviewer isn't illiterate (Why else would he be humbly penning article after article on this website, subtly forcing his opinions down on unknowing readers?), but there is something about him and books which just don't get along. You see, what this reviewer needs to know, he gets the information from the movies he watches. The attack on Pearl Harbour? Were Kate Beckinsale, Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett somewhere dodging the bombs set off by Michael Bay? Oskar Schindler? The 1976 Tangshan earthquake? Was Feng Xiaogang somewhere making people cry with his weep a minute story? So when this reviewer hears his more intellectual friends talking about the Millennium Trilogy, he has no idea what this was about until some kind film distributor brought this movie adaptation to Singapore.Based on an award winning crime novel by the late Swedish author Stieg Larsson, this movie version tells the riveting story of a journalist who is employed to search for a woman has been missing for 40 years. He is assisted by the titular character, a girl with a dragon tattoo, who is a computer hacker.The short synopsis sums up the 152 minute movie in a few sentences. If you have read the novel, you'd know there are a lot more details that have been left out. That is intentional because, if like this reviewer, you are one who doesn't read (you should, really – there's nothing to be proud of when you go around telling people that you don't read), the greatness of this movie is sitting through it and discovering the details bit by bit – yes, all two and a half hours of it.Director Niels Arden Oplev manages to captivate his audiences with this movie like how he would with a well written novel. Minute by minute, he makes you pay attention to the plot development and character evolution like how you would flip through a book page by page. You anticipate the unfolding of the story plot like how you refuse to put down a book, because you want to find out what happens in the next chapter. Before you know it, you have finished the book, oops, we mean, movie, satisfied with the journey you have just taken with the characters.The casting of the two main leads is spot on too. Michael Nyqvist plays the journalist who is determined to uncover a mystery that has spanned a few generations. The actor's credible performance makes you go on this dangerous, perilous and almost fatal ride with him. There are occasions you feel his fatigue, but the power to carry on engages you. Even more commanding on screen is Noomi Rapace who plays the girl with the dragon tattoo. Her mesmerizing and compelling presence is a gem, given the uncountable sweet young things out there trying to make it big. The role requires her to go through some torturous moments, and the graphic violence may just make you squirm in your seat.And why are we not surprised that Hollywood is going to have its own version of this Swedish movie? With Daniel Craig signing on for the role played by Nyqvist and the crucial role of the computer hacker still unknown, we can only wait with abated breath how our American friends will fare with David Fincher helming the production as director. Meanwhile, we shall await some kind distributor to bring in the second and third installments of Larsson's trilogy, The Girl Who Played with Fire and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.

"A whodunit by its own right, cognitive solutions and resourceful set-up for its next two trilogy companion films","""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" introduced us to Lisbeth Salander, the heroine focused in Swedish author Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy. It is said that Larsson was impressed by childhood heroine ""Pippi Longstocking"" (from the pen of Swedish children's author Astrid Lindgren) who is known to be a brave, independent girl with exceptional stamina and courage. So Lisbeth's character was modeled after Pippi, in a way. A modern Pippi, Lisbeth sure is: fearless, intelligent, uninhibited, and very much in control of herself at the prime age of 24, a loner with a mysterious background.This whodunit is without the involvement of police-detective or inspector (so it's not quite like Poirot or Sherlock Holmes) - we are following two consummate investigative brains, one is that of the ever-revolving, daring Lisbeth Salander's, the other is Millennium journalist Mikael Blomkvist's which is just as bold if not reservedly so. Hence the cognitive, methodical unraveling of the Vander family mystery at hand that Blomkvist was given, by fate if you will, linked up with Salander (reluctantly or not) - together they're on the trail to decode a 'forty year old' murderous secret. The nature of the investigation somehow was very close to Lisbeth's heart and being. The original Swedish title ""Men Who Hate Women"" might provide inklings to the topic, then again, is that all there is? Danish director Niels Arden Oplev elegantly delivered the characters and storyline without over-the-top gratuitous action, chase, or gore. Yes, there are certain scenes that are 'unapologetically' frank, physical, sexual or otherwise - but they were crucial to the core of the story and the decoding process of the dark history in stored for our protagonists. (It may not be as grand as the Vatican exposure in ""Angels and Demons"", but the suggestion of the Third Reich connection is no small matter, either.)It's been 4 months 12 days since I last saw ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" and the detail deductions, investigative discovery steps by the two leads were still vivid in my mind when I recall the film. That's kudos to the impressive portrayals of Lisbeth by Noomi Rapace and Blomkvist by Michael Nyqvist. Together they have played off each other, one fiery and one more reticent, one more venturous and the other cautious, under the thoughtful direction from Oplev, and thanks to a competent production crew of two screenwriters, cinematographer, two editors, composer, production, costume and sound designers, makeup, and talented supporting cast, ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" is an entertaining suspenseful thriller, even when you have to read the subtitles, the tension and high drama, you will appreciate, from beginning to end.Whether you'll see all three films in the ""Millennium"" trilogy or not, this first installment is worthy of your time if you like movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
what a let down!,"I read the book, loved it. the film, not so much. first off the film seemed to drag and the ending was obvious (as noted by my partner who hadn't read the book).Character development was horrible. We don't really know why Blomkvist agrees to investigates Harriet's death or why Salander takes interest.In the book Salander rages like an insane person. This isn't really expressed in the movie. OK she fights back when some guys attack her in the subway but that doesn't really certify insane anger..Why did martin run away after being hit on the shoulder with a golf club? Isn't he a sadistic cold blooded killer and THIS scared him off. wow Harriet could have saved herself a lot of trouble had she invested in some clubs. In the book Salander does more than strike him with a club.Also I found it interesting how the bit about Martin taking sexual interest with Blomkvist was completely left out.Mellinum is hardly incorporated, which is a major focal point of the book.It was painfully long.If you like this movie and now want to read the sequel ""the girl who played with fire"" well forget it, you won't understand much because the film really left out a lot of crucial info.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Swedish Job,"To tell you the truth, I was not expecting anything similar to this. It is a great movie. I don't know if it is because I am not used to watching European movies or the plot is just great, but I was sitting down during the movie and I didn't move. This rarely happens...In my opinion, the best part is the last part of the movies. It doesn't end like American movies where you have cops arrive at the end and then everything is fine. This movies went on for about 20 minutes and the end was just awesome.I would say that this is a crossover between Taken, Silance of the Lambs and Inglorious Basterds. If you like any of these movies, you will definitely like this one then. I highly recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
provocative,"Loved this film and hope the US cinema doesn't remake it as it is fine as it is. Noomi is superb in bringing the character Lisbeth to life. All in all I can't wait for ""Fire"", and ""Hornets Nest"". Currently reading the books and don't find that precise following of the book doesn't take anything away from the film. Provocative and a grabber! I really loved the look of the film from the onset and give props to the set dressers and location scouts for making this gritty looking piece. Why remake something that is good even if it's in a foreign language? I didn't find the subtitles to be distracting at all. Anti hero is an understatement here as Lisbeth has layer upon layer of interest. Bring it on, and please don't stop at 3. This is refreshing and I'd compare it to the US made Bourne series.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The Vidiot Reviews...,"The Girl with the Dragon TattooFor her sake, I hope the girl in question went with an image of a dragon and not a Chinese character of the word, because then they'd have to change this film's title to The Girl with the Supermarket Love Shoe Tattoo.Unfortunately, this thriller isn't about a white girl who refuses to do her research before getting inked, it is, however, about an inked white girl who does too much research.When disgraced journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) is hired to solve the 40-year- old mystery surrounding the disappearance of Harriet Vanger, he realizes that all of his suspects are related to her. Meanwhile, a cyberpunk computer hacker (Noomi Rapace) with a keen interest in the case begins e-mailing Mikael pertinent information. Making an effective team, the unlikely pair soon begins solving additional murders that help to further implicate the Vanger family.Rank with kindred carnality, Nazis affectations and corkscrew twists, this adaptation of a Swedish novel–the first in a trilogy–is a rich and sadistic whodunit.And while a tattooed investigator seems unprofessional, face it: with Generation Y taking over the workforce we're bound to see plenty more doctors, lawyers and teachers sporting lower-back tattoos and pierced scrotums.

Riveting thriller from the pen of Stieg Larsson with a truly memorable performance from Noomi Rapace,"Based of the first novel of the 'Millennium Trilogy' by Stieg Larsson, this Swedish film adaptation is (IMO) quite excellent. I should make it clear that I watched the extended edition which runs for just short of three hours. Also, being a bit of a purist, I watched it with subtitles, although there is the option of a dubbed version for those not quite so brave. I was quite surprised just how enthralling it was and, having never read the novels, just what a well written drama it turned out to be. More of my thoughts after this very brief summary.Mikael Blomkvist is the editor of a magazine, 'Millennium', that has accused businessman Hans-Erik Wennerström of some wrongdoing. The case went to court and Blomkvist lost. He has just three months before he has to go to jail for six months. Unbeknownst to him, he has been investigated himself by a professional hacker, Lisbeth Salander, who works for a security firm. The reason becomes clear when Blomkvist is hired by wealthy businessman, Henrik Vanger, to investigate the disappearance of his niece more than forty years ago. Moving out to the remote island where the Vanger family all live, in separate houses, Blomkvist is soon embroiled in the case. Little does he know though, but Lisbeth Salander is still keeping tabs on him and when she sends him the answer to a vital clue the unlikely pair end up joining forces in order to solve the case. There is an awful lot more to tell but I dare not say it or the Spoiler Police might find a way to make me disappear.A very well made film with an almost washed-out look to the visuals which always makes me think of northern climes. I also thought the music by Jacob Groth was excellent and fitting the, at times, haunting piece very well. As for performances, well, both Michael Nyqvist as Mikael Blomkvist and Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander were outstanding particularly Noomi Rapace. Also worthy of note were; Lena Endre as Erika Berger, Sven-Bertil Taube as Henrik Vanger, Peter Haber as Martin Vanger, Peter Andersson as Nils Bjurman, Marika Lagercrantz as Cecilia Vanger, Ingvar Hirdwall as Dirch Frode and Björn Granath as Gustav Morell.On the DVD the film is split into two parts, each of about ninety minutes. This, I found, made it feel a little bit like a TV adaptation rather than a cinema release. Don't get me wrong, all the production values of a big cinema release are there, but I did, at times, feel like I was watching a major two-parter on HBO (or Sky Atlantic for us Brits), albeit in Swedish. Despite this, I still very much enjoyed this mystery thriller and I'm very much looking forward to seeing the other two parts of the set. Maybe I'll have to watch a couple of things in English in between too much Swedish at once can really get taxing. Over all though, totally engrossing with some truly excellent performances Highly recommended.My Score: 8.2/10 IMDb Score: 7.7/10 (based on 48,699 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 86/100 (based on 165 reviews counted at the time of going to press).",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Excellent !!!,"Watch this with subtitles, not dubbed! This film is so completely engaging and superb! I have read the novels (more than once) and seen the trilogy (more than once) and indeed prefer the original-language version to the one that is dubbed, and even more than the disappointing English version, which was flat, and too focused solely on the sexual aspect of this great story. Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander is amazing!! Also love Michael Bloomqvist. While Daniel Craig is indeed a great actor, and so easy on the eyes to watch, Michael is an everyman actor who give his character as Lisbeth's champion true soul. By all means, also see the Millennium TV series, too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Nicely adapted, but dull","There were some good things about Steig Larsson's bestselling thriller, 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo': it was readable, there was a well constructed socio-political backdrop, and the core plot was an cleverly constructed variant of that old chestnut, the closed room mystery, with a solid detective story to eventually unpick it. There were also some things I disliked: the story was supposedly written to highlight male violence against women, but arguably revelled in such violence itself and then ""balanced"" this by equally grisly elements of revenge; the author's relentless plugging of Apple Macs was tedious and devoid of novelistic purpose; the central male character appeared to be a highly flattering portrait of the author's alter ego; while the central female character, Soljander, appeared to be pretty much whatever the author wanted her to be at each moment of the story, sexy and unsexy by turn, and a miraculously brilliant computer hacker to boot. Also, the taut central plot ultimately dissolved into something much more gruesome, but also less convincing. This (Swedish) film version (the first of two, the other made by Hollywood) gets some things right, most notably through its interpretations of the leading roles. Soljander here seems more coherent and thereby interesting, than she does in the book. But the book's greatest strength, its procedural detail, is harder to follow, and the director tends to rather spell out the meaning to compensate. The greatest failing, however, is shared with the book, and it's simply that the story is wildly over-complex, Larsson had a clutch of interesting ideas but maybe lacked the confidence to trust just one; either that, or he correctly judged the public appetite for wild, over-the-top tales. I've seen worse thrillers; but I have to say, I found this one dull.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Better and worse than the English version in different ways,"Watched this original Swedish version after watching the 2011 Rooney Mara version. It's not bad considering the budget was a lot less. Both have their strengths and weaknesses and it's interesting to compare them.Noomi Rapace's portrayal is more like a normal person and less punky than Rooney - she is actually quite sweet, although she is less beautiful than Rooney. Noomi reminds me of Nadal. The actor playing Mikael in the Swedish version is a bit stony looking. Daniel Craig was more charming. The Swedish version couldn't boast the star power of Christoper Plummer and Joely Richardson.The Swedish version is better in some ways: the crimes are more clearly explained. The English version is a bit rushed and confusing in some crucial plot areas. It was interesting to see Lisbeth's parents which is shown in the Swedish version not the English one.The English version has better casting, a better score and the Zurich transformation of Lisbeth was one of the best parts of the movie. It was glanced over in the Swedish version.Overall I liked the English version better. But the Swedish version is about 80% as good.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"The girl with the thrills, kills and disturbing rape scenes","Based on the best selling novel by Stieg Larsson, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is the first film adaptation from the Millennium Trilogy starring Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapice. I haven't read any of the novels, but after watching this movie, I am going out to purchase them and read them.The characters played by Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapice are superbly acted and were very believable. I was incredibly impressed by their talent and how they were able to portray their characters throughout the film. They definitely deserve an award for their performances.This film was superbly shot, with beautiful cinematography that captures the beauty and desolateness of the island where the film is set. But at the same time, switches dramatically to capture the violent happenings in the film.The violence and horror of the rape and the murder scenes sent chills up my spine, and I found myself sitting in front of the screen without blinking for long periods throughout the movie (something not many movies are able to do).I will be very interested to see the Hollywood remake that is scheduled to be released during 2011 and whether they mutilate a brilliant movie, or if they do it justice.The film is a fast paced thriller and is definitely not for the feint of heart.

"Great cinematography, acting and editing.","Having read the books quite a few years ago, I don't remember much of the details from there, but think this film greatly captures the essence of the book. It is of course, not an exact adaptation, however I did not feel that they missed much out that was crucial to the story. There are some discrepancies compared to the book though that I think are unnecessary changes. Just to note, this is the Swedish version that I watched, maybe I will watch the Hollywood one to see if it's better though I don't think it will be.The cast for this did a good job and was a really good fit for the characters they were portraying; with the exception of one actress that I felt did not fit into the image of her character. Nyqvist does well as Blomkvist, a confident kind of gentle person with attention to detail who had a pretty good upbringing. In contrast Rapace as Salander has had a much darker life and she portrays this perfectly. Her stoic expressions and speech delivery depicts how she has that emotional barrier and makes sure not to get attached to anyone.The story too is shrouded in darkness and reflects Salander's life. There is quite a bit of gruesome and grotesque images in the film, but fortunately it is easy to tell when it will appear so I can be prepared and avert my eyes. There is also some thriller action and the music score does well to match the mood of the scenes.This film also had great cinematography – especially with landscapes. Lots of beautiful shots and some great aerial perspectives.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2009),"Incredible thriller that reminded me of the first time I watched Silence of the Lambs and Se7en. It's been planned meticulously, with an airtight pacing that knows when to speed up or slow down. The first hour has the protagonists separated, which allows them to each grow on their own merits. When they finally meet, the relationship doesn't feel rushed or forced and it's great to see them grow. The film also manages to have an intriguing mystery, without resorting to overblown ridiculousness. The cinematography was breathtaking, making small apartments stand out as worlds to be explored. Rapace has a fine career ahead of her and I can't wait to see the next two parts in this trilogy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
an enemy of an enemy is a friend,"At first glance Lisbeth and Mikael have nothing in common. The former is a shady tattooed young hacker with an explosive temper and the latter is a nerdy traditional journalist and family man with a penchant for jogging in the woods to ease a troubled mind. Despite their differences, Lisbeth and Mikael collide in more ways than one. As Mikael investigates an unsolved murder perpetrated 40 years ago in a remote northern town, he quickly wades in over his head. Lisbeth's skillset could be helpful to Mikael, but since cooperation isn't her style he had better hope there is truth to the old saying; an enemy of an enemy is a friend.Produced at a mere $13 million, the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo became a worldwide sensation which returned ten times that amount. It did a number of things right including turning the crime thriller genre on its head, frequent role reversals, unpredictability, compelling characters that hit rock bottom and claw their way back, casting the talented Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth, and more. There is depth without pretentiousness. Old school thrills come in modern packaging. Nothing is as it seems (""fair is foul and foul is fair, hover through the fog and filthy air,"" - Macbeth). Intriguing themes include trusting instincts, redemption and determining the appropriate punishment for evil deeds. There are flashes of disturbing and brutal violence and rape.For the Brits it was the best film NOT in the English language. The Swedish version of the film is more authentic and realistic than the latter Hollywood adaptation. For one thing, Michael Nyqvist is more vulnerable and believable as Mikael than strapping Daniel Craig. The Hollywood version, despite such drawbacks, is still worthwhile as it includes interesting plot twists and is very stylish. The film is based on the novel by Stieg Larsson.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"An unremitting and wondrously directed causality thriller, a film with ample attention to both character and narrative that is hard not to get excited about.","The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is the adaptation of the first of three novels in a literary franchise penned by Swedish author Stieg Larsson; a recent series of books which went on to garner domestic, and later international, responses of an highly affectionate sort. Their reputation, or aura, appears only to have intensified following Larsson's own unfortunate passing in 2004 at the age of 50; a tragic happening that saw the series remain stagnant for a few years until reaching the stage of filmic pre-production brought about by joint-Swedish and Danish companies. As each book was adapted into a film, and consequently did the rounds at European festival circuits as well as multiplex cinemas alike, the staying power of the whole franchise has escalated – the effect of these numerous things totalling up and resulting in the much more recent announcement, begrudgingly to most, that accomplished American director David Fincher will be reworking them in the English language. This initial adaptation more than makes the grade, the film an electrifying and inspiring slice of cause and effect thriller film-making; a story all-at-once brutally but brilliantly fleshed out from twisting, turning and often sordid foundations into a cut-and-dry piece we are behind every step of the way.If, in the franchise, there is this overall sense of danger intensification with each new title (the beginning with a titular ""girl"" and her dragon tattoo spilling out into that same titular girl and her consequent ""Playing with Fire"" which further still leads onto a subsequent ""Kicking"" of a ""Hornet's Nest""), then so too is there such a sense as to the general well-being of the central characters in this first film. The film arrives on account of Danish director Niels Arden Oplev , a man working from a screenplay by his Danish colleagues in Nikolaj Arcel and Rasmus Heisterberg. It is driven by Swedish performers from an original Swedish text - this sense of two sets of varying people, from differing nations or otherwise, coming together and working towards one goal additionally prominent throughout the piece. Our two leads, a tall and somewhat spindly 24 year old female hacker/surveillance expert named Lisbeth Salander, played by Noomi Rapace, and her eventual ally Mikael Blomkvist (Nyqvist), a disgraced but ultimately innocent middle-aged man, are two people whose binary oppositions to one another are plentiful, but their forging of a team and taking on the elements epitomising much of the behind the camera camaraderie.Lisbeth cuts an odd figure, a shaggy looking young woman with piercings over most of her face; spiked black hair and similarly toned makeup. She spies on Blomkvist on account of a security firm whom want tabs kept on him, a journalist with a Stockholm magazine who finds himself six months away from a jail term for loosing a libel case on a powerful domestic businessman. Lisbeth comes across as a post-modern spin on the old private eye character from decades old. Alone, wry and facing imposing odds in a brooding city locale, we observe her treading a fine line between the moral course and the righteous one never really knowing what to think of her. Like private investigators of old, she watches another human being in the only fashion you'd expect for this day and age: via illegal access to their laptop and SMS in-boxes - all before being caught up in a wider web of smut and danger that she didn't initially envisage.In spite of his initial troubles with the law, Blomkvist is a character the film constructs as homely and friendly; an alluding to innocence through time spent at home with a large, loving group of close friends at a Christmas function. In tandem with this, Nyqvist delivers the subtly disparaged reactions required to have us tempted into siding with him when required as he stands in the street with the news coverage of his case's results all around him. Prior to his sentence taking effect, he is given a job by a company tycoon named Henrik Vanger (Taube); a job that sees him charged with finding a certain Harriet, Henrik's niece, who vanished as a young girl nearly forty years ago. Where Lisbeth cuts a dash as a 21st Century private eye, Blomkvist will go on to epitomise a more classical breed of private investigator; a man of fair age granted that grizzled look and forced out and about into a sea of investigation and logical deduction. In the vein of an American film noir from yester-year, this lead must get the low-down on a specific person who has gone missing.The body of the film is the two of them working together, a happening born out of Lisbeth's independent attitude to down-tools at her end and contact him over something he's missed in the disappearance. Around their coming together lies a delicate, intricate character study on top of a diligent thriller narrative which keeps on going and keeps working as well as it does. Lisbeth is established to despise men with the men in her life for the best part of the opening half an hour being slimy, grotesque and exploitative. The realisation of her Misandric attitudes, more broadly linked to a past tragedy in life, is wonderfully inserted into the meat of the film's investigative strand; her coming into contact with Blomkvist the bonding with a male specimen that is kind, understanding and is ultimately an individual doing what he's doing for the greater good of another female. Together, they battle what essentially transpires to be a bone-chilling right-wing force of misogyny. The film is an exciting, diligent thriller; a film with an intelligent character study and a cracking narrative always asking us to keep up to its speed, the likes of which it is difficult not to whole heartedly recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
who dunnit horror movie combo,"This Swedish who dunnit missing heiress/murder mystery/serial killer saga is a notch or two above the usual but nothing special. I guessed at the biblical connection immediately (Magda etc..) but was hoping against hope that this mass market cliché would not turn out to be true.Once the biblical connection was forged this movie went from a 7 to a 5 and then when the Nazi and Jewish connections were added it went down to a 0. When will they bury that tired theme!?--now almost completely incredulous as the villains age into their late 80s or 90s.I found the violent sex scenes rather middle class and tame...sodomy and oral sex is the best they could come up with? But the girl gets even with a dildo! So innocent and corny as to be laughable.The cinematography was below average--nothing soothing fun exciting or unique in the visual department in fact the opposite.The violence against women social message was overdone baggage especially the unbelievable subplot of the probation case manager.The serial killer stuff is sort of grafted on as something historical and incidental to the main action... If I had known the movie contained these sub themes I would never have watched it--I like mysteries not horror movies.I came apon this movie in a round about way. I had watched ""Headhunters"" a Norwegian movie which is 1000 times better than this film and when reading up about it I chanced apon this title in some way. Not in the same league at all.It got an extra star for the Swedish provenance and the suspense part of the who dunnit--up to the bible clue that aspect was quite good and is successful in hooking you into watching the movie.

"Good plot, there with Borne Identity, Seven, Silence of the Lambs, Usual Suspects....but....","I had not read the trilogy of books upon which this one is based but the plot in and of itself blew me away. I felt it was up there with movies like Seven or Silence of the Lambs. Even my wife who reads a million Sue Grafton type murder / mysteries was surprised by the major revelations in the movie and did not guess whodunnit as it she is apt to often do.Although I would give the plot and story and easy 10/10, what I didn't like as much were the actors. I didn't find them believable and sometimes they were too stiff. Not bad acting but just not as good as this story deserved. Maybe too Swedish? Maybe just 2-dimensional? I didn't start warming up to the actors until the last 1/3 of the movie where it seems they must have gotten into the zone with the characters they were supposed to play.Noomi Rapace did a decent job as the lone-wolf-hacker-for-hire with the troubled past. Michael Nyqvist wasn't terrible, just so so. Better towards the end though.I do have to agree with some of the other comments about the scenes of sexual violence, especially the scene with Lisbeth's ""Guardian"" in his room. That scene made me cringe and squirm in the same way the rape scene from Blindness made me squirm and cringe. It is brutal. You've been warned.All in all, this movie is worth your while and you will enjoy it if movies like Usual Suspects, Oldboy, Seven, or Silence of The Lambs are your thing.

Violence in a Volvo - Sado-fueled Swedish Crime Thriller,"Firstly, 'The Girl With' film is very good indeed. Having read the 'Millennium' trilogy of the award winning, best-selling books by the late Stieg Larsson, it is difficult not to compare the two mediums. The point to realize is that the films are solid enough to represent and serve justice to the books, in combining ways, being impressive in their own right.The films pleasingly stick to its Swedish routes, being shot in Sweden and also in Swedish (with optional English Dub versions that are also good). It also remains low budget in feel, being dark and full of tension and with moments of suspense and shocking content (i.e the several rapes/sex scenes). There is a Hollywood adaptation being planned, with Daniel Craig being confirmed as the lead, and this I feel is a real shame, as it will undoubtedly lose some of it's integrity.The book's original title was 'Men Who Hate Women', which really is the theme and underlying subject matter fueling this excellent modern crime drama thriller. This inclusion and obsession of violence against women in contemporary Swedish society, addresses psychological issues of crimes and how people's backgrounds can ultimately affect them later in life.It is great that the stories will reach a bigger audience base but it is a bit of a shame that many will miss out on reading such quality novels. To stop myself comparing the two I would say most thriller and drama film fans will enjoy both of the 'Girl' films, probably finding them more shocking, impressive and scary than the avid book fans.My only criticisms are that some scenes are rushed, such as the super speedy and ridiculous computer hacking, evidence and research processing and many of the other characters are simply visited briefly and with no depth. But, in all fairness a film that is over 2 hours does well to cover a 538 page book with 30+ chapters!Comparing the film to the Book;The film is a straight copy of it's 2005 published book, and having read the book first I noticed these ten main differences, changes and cuts:1.Mikael Blomkvist's affair with Erika Berger was cut out (although there is a miss-able mention of him having found a woman, just a woman who was already married)2.When Blomkvist reviews records of the Parade there is now a video clip, as well as just photographs.3.I do not remember any attack on Lisbeth Salander, in the tube station. She is also colder, more petite and harsher than some readers will have imagined. Does this make her less likable? Or is this the point of film 2?4.Blomkvist has flashbacks of babysitting by the missing girl5.Lisbeth sports a huge tattoo on her back, as well as one on her leg, the book's front cover shows her with a small dragon on her shoulder.6.Blomkvist also does not have sexual relations with suspect Cecilia Vagner.7.The sex scenes are changed slightly in detail.8.The dungeon and small village is different in appearance.9.Lisbeth also has flashbacks, these are not in the book but do add to the film and explaining her character's troubled past.10.Blomkvist works solely from his new cabin home, not venturing into the local town when at the Vagner's estate.Other interesting facts;It is the 2010 best-selling foreign language film in the UK.David Fincher is set to direct the Hollywood adaptation of the book, he directed Seven, Fight Club, Panic Room and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Brad Pitt is obviously a fan.The main characters of Blomkvist and Salander's inspiration originates from Kalle Blomkvist (a Swedish fictional detective) and a grown-up Pippi Longstocking (a Swedish fictional story about a super human girl).Stieg Larsson, the writer, worked on his books as more of a hobby, with them only being published after his death in 2004. By 2010 they have sold over 27 million copies in 40 countries. His career in writing includes Science fiction journals, political paper journalism and detective inspired stories.Love it / Loathe itYou may love it for the excellent story, reader or not, and the themes, graphic scenes and characters.

great movie but...,All the reviews had showed the examples why this movie is good and unique and inspiring so I wont repeat those things.It is really a great movie but I have just a tiny critique about the final episode. I think they should end it after the car accident or lets say Kalle's release from jail. The money transferring stuff was a bit unnecessary and lets say childish and scratchy. I think this happens a lot in European movies because due to the smaller film industry European directors have less chance to describe themselves so they try to show multiple concepts in just one shot. Maybe the American version will be shortened a bit in scenario and strengthen the details of tracking the killer episode. I still give credit to the text and direction they are purely unique and thrilling.,8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Totally Awesome,"There are not many films that you are still thinking about several days later, but this is one. The acting from a cast of (in the US / UK ) unknowns was first rate. Not having a well known star helped with the sense of disbelief. Somehow when watching Jennifer Aniston, for instance you always know its her and you can't forget its a film your watching. This was very real, too real in the rape scenes, and in the graphic coverage of the serial killer, but not poorer for attempting verisimilitude. Yes some parts of this were uncomfortable to watch, and God knows how the TV will ever show it uncut. But I applaud the film makers for doing it so well.

"Good movie, not nearly as good as the book, but it managed to capture some of the essence of  it","I have to say movies are extremely rarely as good or better and for obvious reasons never as detailed than the book they are based, and this movie is not the exception.Make no mistake, this is a very good mystery thriller, the movie did manage to capture the essence of most of the characters, specially Lisbeth, and that translate well on the screen, making it a very enjoyable movie, however, even tho the movie is nearly 2h30m, the whole investigation, which is the core of the story, just seemed rather rushed and easy, the complete opposite of the book.Even tho the book is much, much better, the movie is still a very good thriller, and I recommend both.Rate: 8/10 (I think I was generous).",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"This dark thriller will keep you on the edge of your seat, but beware, it doesn't pull any punches!","I had the benefit of watching this film without knowing what it was about, so I won't tip you off beyond the synopsis above...but I will strongly recommend that you see this movie at some point. Some parts of the film are just pretty good and interesting...the rest of the film is downright awesome. Beware, it doesn't pull many punches, and can be pretty brutal; but you will probably be on the edge of your seat throughout, in a good way. Rapace very competently portrayed the weird, strong anti-heroine, which was key because so much of this film relies on what's going on behind her steely, expressionless gaze...her performance lives in the eyes...she really should've shaved those pits, though...seeing her hairy underarms was one of the most disturbing parts of the movie for me. Still, this is one of the best girl-power films I've ever watched. I'm putting on my Susan B. Anthony button as I type this. I'm going to have to set some time aside in the future and watch the American version so I can see what it did differently...but I'm going to need a while to recover from the little bits of innocence that died inside me during this film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Good Adaptation of Larsson's First Millennium Novel,"I remember this movie getting a lot of buzz when I was in college. A lot of other students were chatting about it, but I never really looked into it until David Fincher (one of my favorite directors) chose to adapt the book for American audiences in 2011. So yeah, I was a little late to the party when it came to appreciating Stieg Larsson's Millennium series. It was Fincher's adaptation that grabbed my attention and I've since read all three books and watched the extended additions of each of the three Swedish films. So now that I've had enough exposure to the series to form a reasonable opinion, let me say that I enjoyed the Swedish version directed by Niels Arden Oplev, but not as much as I enjoyed Fincher's version. THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is a complex story revolving around the forty-year-old unsolved disappearance of a sixteen-year-old girl. Controversial journalist Mikael Blomkvist has been disgraced in the courts when he's found guilty of libel against a billionaire industrialist. Facing a sentence of three months in prison, he's sought out by the wealthy Henrik Vanger to solve the mysterious disappearance of his niece Harriet in 1966. She disappeared without a trace and previous investigations have yielded nothing: no body, no evidence of foul play. Just gone. Henrik believes a member of his unsavory family murdered Harriet, and he hopes Mikael can find the answer he's been waiting for. But Mikael will need help, and he turns to antisocial computer hacker Lisbeth Salander, a woman with a mountain of her own issues, to solve the case.Having read the book before I watched the Swedish film, I know that a lot was left on due to time constraints. The book is just too detailed to fit everything into a feature film of reasonable length (and this movie already pushes the boundary with a total three hour runtime). The exhaustive detail behind the Wennerström affair, Blomkvist's brief tryst with Cecilia Vanger, further details about his investigation into Harriet's disappearance, and more were removed to trim the story down to a manageable length. I'm cool with that. I understand, and the movie still manages to put together a taut mystery that will keep you engaged until the final reveal. If you haven't seen the movies or read the books, be forewarned: these are slow-burning story lines. Both the book and the movie move pretty slowly at times and can take a while to get moving, but grab hold of you when they do. Mikael's investigation involves a lot of searching through archives and old photos so it doesn't always make for the most interesting cinema material. Fortunately, just when your interest threatens to weaken, the movie throws out a curve-ball to thrust you back into the story. It's a rich story that does weaken a bit when adapted for the screen, so I'd certainly recommend anyone who enjoyed the movie to seek out the book as well if for no other reason than to fill out the rest of the story.I'm not going to bother comparing the primary cast members here to those in Fincher's film because they're separate entities and I felt both did admirable jobs in filling the roles from the novel. Noomi Rapace is Lisbeth Salander, the title heroine of THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO. She does a pretty awesome job bringing Lisbeth's her awkward antisocial personality to life, but there were times when it didn't feel legitimate. It wasn't enough to rip me out of a scene or anything, just a minor nitpick and a minor complaint. In general, I thought Rapace did a fine job embracing this character and I she was a great choice for the trilogy. The same can be said for Michael Nyqvist as Blomkvist. I had a hard time accepting him at first because I had come to envision Daniel Craig in the role, but he grew on me fast and I've come to believe he was an excellent choice. I'd even go so far as to say he was a better fit for the character than Craig in terms of style and personality. The two of them have great chemistry between them that helps their odd relationship work. The two of them were inspired casting on the film's part and establish themselves solidly in the characters they would then portray in two more movies. This deliberately-paced foreign film may not appeal to mass American audiences, but those of us who were willing to give it a chance are in for a good film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Noomi Rapace the supergirl,"I've become a big fan of Noomi Rapace who plays Lisbeth Salander, after watching this flick. Lisbeth can do anything. She is a Super-woman in this flick. This flick was awesome. Despite being around 150 min movie, it didn't look dull or slow at any moment.Not only this, I've seen the entire Millennium trilogy, and Noomi Rapace did a complete justice to the character of Lisbeth Salander. I don't think anyone could have played that character better than Noomi.Girl with a dragon tattoo (G.W.D.T) is a story of a hacker Lisbeth Salander who in some circumstances helps out a reporter in solving a case of a girl missing for 40 years. I won't tell anything more. This is a movie one of its own kind, so it must be seen.But I always see that if any good foreign language film is made, Hollywood always tries to make a rehashed version ( 13 tzameti is a good example, the original french version is a way better than the Hollywood version.)The Hollywood version of G.W.D.T looks dull compared to the Swedish version. The actors look perfunctory and the performance by them is not very good. When you make a rehashed version of a foreign flick, you are supposed to make the film better than the original film ( Example is The Departed directed by Martin Scorcese)I'd say stick with the original Swedish version because the performance by the actors are more lively. I give 9/10 to this film and two thumbs up to Noomi Rapace,without whom Lisbeth Salander's character couldn't have lived.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Lena over Noomi any day,"Hey everyone out there who responds to really excellent actresses at the top of their game. I have long been an admirer of Lena Endre, through Gossip and Faithless especially. I firmly believe she is the best actress around at the moment and would be a huge star if she were more arrogant (which she most definitely is not) and American (which I am so glad she is not). She has a deep and devastating well of emotional depth and an ability to access those emotions with breathtaking honesty. Noomi Rapace is a good young actress (although I must confess of the young Scandinavians I prefer Anna Bjork but that is personal preference) but Lena is the undisputed master of her craft and it is about time she were given the credit she deserves. This is an actress that Ingmar Bergman called the ""Stradavarius of actors"", the directors perfect instrument. I could go on for hours but please take this thought away with you. Flashy, over exposed emotions are meat and drink for an actor, inhabiting and examining the arc and consciousness of another human being is witchcraft, soul stealing. Lena Endre can steal anyone's soul in a crystal clear 24 frame study of perfection.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Very Appealing and Deep,"I must admit that I never watched any Swedish films before and this one was a novelty thing, if I may say so. t first, I was a bit skeptical and sour about that, but then this slow, growing film got me in and made me thrilled. Outstanding work, great plot, mesmerizing slow tempo which is a big plus. Marvelous severe Swedish nature. And then, Blomqvist and Rapace as two main heroes. I must say, they both play great. Very convincing and very thrilling. The plot is a bit predictable, especially, when we were given some hint about Nazi connections, but then, it still rocks good! There are some drawbacks, of course. Some nudity, graphic violence and rape scenes are not appealing at all, and deeply disturbing, and I am awfully sorry, but the view of hairy armpits of Lisbeth does not add to the pleasure of watching. Anyway, minor goofs and violent details did not spoil the general big picture.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The Birth Of Nordic Noir,"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo plus the other 2 movies.The genesis of a new genre, namely that of Nordic Noir, arrived with the publication and subsequent creation of these three films.Without doubt their instigation comes from a very dark place with an emotional intelligence and suspicious responses emanating from damaged victims who struggle to survive.The equally remarkable conversion of these books in an unflinching way to the screen is simply staggered.You are not meant to enjoy but experience by proxy Lisbeth austere animalistic instincts and her inability to trust, and equally experience Mikel's warmth and compassion.The formula for Nordic noir is establishedA damaged investigatorAll appears calm but all is rotten underneathEveryone is an obstruction to the investigationWe see everything though the eyes of the investigatorWe are led by evidence and not supposition.I'm giving the 10 outta 10 for being so brilliant.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

The work of Noomi Rapace was the only stronger think in this movie. Also I'd like the photography and the beautiful locations. I hope the screenwriter and director of the American Movie made a better version of the story, more accurate and with less police clichés.

Gripping Swedish Thriller,"'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' is a Swedish language thriller of the book with the same name and resulted in lead, Noomi rapace becoming an international star, and also a Hollywood remake directed by David Fincher. I have not read any of the book series and only previously seen the Hollywood version (2011), but I have to say I was very impressed with this original movie.The subject matter is dark, dealing with rape and murder and with many scenes being graphic in content, but it is also a whodunnit and a thriller which keeps the viewer gripped throughout. The runtime is long but I can honestly say the time flew by and I was not looking at my watch at all. There are enough twist and turns and character development to keep it fully engaging to the viewer and the thrilling ride holds a number of surprises along the way.I was very impressed with the direction and shooting which nicely portrays the cold and dark Nordic winter and isolation in that part of the world, and this really adds to the darkness of the theme. To be honest I'm not sure why it was remade as there was little to do better than what is provided here. Not to say Fincher's version is inferior, on the contrary, I was also impressed with that movie as well, but there are a few small elements that seem to have been modified (maybe to suit the different expected viewer), but on reflection this is the superior product.Overall, this is a really well made thriller with strong acting across the board, and I for one am looking forward to watching the next instalment.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

That was phenomenal!,"This was a first time watch for me and I loved it. This is definitely one of those movies that isn't going to be for everyone, but it was most certainly for me.Positives for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2009):
The main thing that this movie did for me and all of the people have watched this movie is to absolutely sell you and get you invested in the character of Lisbeth Salander played by Noomi Rapace. This is a character that as soon as you are introduced to her, you want to know everything and anything about this character's backstory and it's no wonder why they made two more movies and released both of them within the same year as this first movie. I also have to give props to Michael Nyqvist as Mikael Blomkvist as I was also invested in hicls character's journey in this movie, which makes it even more surprising and shocking that this guy went on to play easily the weakest and most forgettable villain in the entire Mission: Impossible Franchise. The violence in this movie are very graphic and brutal. The journey and mystery in this movie are very thrilling from start to finish. And finally, I loved the resolutions to both Lisbeth Salander and Mikaela Blomkvist's stories by the end of the movie.Mixes for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2009):
This is a Swedish movie, so if you don't know the language, then you're going to watch this movie with subtitles. Also, this movie is 2-hours, 30-minutes long and it's going to be a very grueling viewing experience for some people.Overall, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2009) is a remarkable and thrilling experience for me and I can't wait to watch the other two movies is this trilogy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
To be honest... this time the American was a little bit better,"As I have testified before, I didn't remember any of the movies. Just remembered both where pretty good and didn't had any knowledge or acquaintance with the book series. This time I had first read the first book and then seen Fincher's version and finally watched this one - Niels Arden Oplev's.They are both rated with the same grade and under sixteen rating and they are both good, but if I have the choose and not because I appreciate more the director or the actors, I would choose the American version from several angles and probably the most important angle is the influence of the book on the script.The book made his impact on both scripts from several points and each director and his script team chose to remove several points that were in the book. Off course none of the movies can withstands the full story and carry it on its back, but the American version, surprisingly, took better elements from the book and included them inside the movie.Both movies are almost at the same length, but the Swedish feels like it is longer and much duller and drearier. The paste seems to be slower and the choices to change the plot's encores is not so clear to me and seems that Fincher took notes and decided what he should focus more and show even better.Noomi Rapace doesn't win in her match with Rooney Mara, but she is giving one hell of a show, that hopefully we will see more of her in the years to come. Michael Nyqvist lacks the charisma that Daniel Craig has and he is paling when comparing between both actors, and still, with all those said, he gives a good performance.The storytelling might be confusing for those that didn't read the book and this film, though is maintain tension and interest, is struggling when comparing it to its American smaller, but much more talented brother. If addressing it as a thriller, that it is, it cannot compare to the book, but does a great job.If taking it against the book and the other version, I think it is slightly less better from both versions, while the book is winning big time and maintains the preferred medium we all need to consume for such stories.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Publishing phenomenon comes to the big screen,"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2009), from the novel by Stieg Larsson, is far and away the best part of the movie adaptation of his Millennium Trilogy. I saw this before reading the book. It was the movie of the second book, The Girl who played with Fire, that inspired me to read the novels, precisely because it felt undercooked as a movie. No such qualms when it comes to part one.Obviously you don't need or expect me to comment on the US remake of a couple of years later. Given that the Swedish original is available with an English language dub, and with the option of Swedish language + English subtitles, you have no excuse wasting your time with reheated soup.A career making role for Noomi Rapace playing Lisbeth, the punky computer hacker with an entire hard drive of dark secrets. The movie also stars Michael Nyqvist (how cool a name is that?) as investigative journalist Blomkvist, asked to dig into a 40-year-old missing person case. Lisbeth eventually joins him in the search for what happened to young Harriet when she was a young lass, and they uncover something much worse, something that threatens both their lives.There's also the parallel story concerning Lisbeth's abuse at the hands of her legal guardian. Make no mistake, this is an adults only movie with strong scenes that will rightly shock you, and which also deserve your admiration for the brilliant acting.It's also a nice opportunity to see Sweden in panorama, city and rurality. I'd recommend reading the follow-up stories instead of seeing the follow-up movies, if only because the novels are more exciting.Tremendous grisly thriller with energetic performances from everyone.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"It's a good, albeit dark, Nordic mystery","It's a dramatic thriller set in 2002-2003 in Stockholm, Sweden. It follows a disgraced journalist and a severely damaged young woman who is an accomplished computer hacker as they sort out a family mystery.Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist), has published a story about a major Swedish industrialist who sues him for libel. He loses and is sentenced to a short term in prison. Meanwhile, Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube), head of the major Vanger industrial group decides to hire Blomkvist on the basis of research by Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace). Salander is a goth-appearing young woman who is brilliant with computers. She has a state-appointed guardian because of her earlier violence against her father.Henrik Vanger wants Blomkvist to discover the truth about the disappearance of his niece, Harriet Vanger (Ewa Fröling), in 1966. It's thought she may have murdered on Children's Day on the island of Hedeby.The plot follows Blomkvist's investigation of the family, which included multiple Nazi collaborators in World War II. Blomkvist discovers that Salander has hacked his computer and is interested in the case. They end up collaborating in the search and discover multi-generational serial killers in the extended family. They also discover the truth about Harriet. There is a side story about Salander's relationship to her sadistic guardian, Nils Bjurman (Peter Andersson).The book and movie were a sensation when they came out.

Engaging and well-made,"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was a very good film. It had fantastic performances, a very engaging storyline, and some great cinematography. I expected it to be more obscure in the way foreign films are. For example, a foreign film like Let The Right One In certainly has a distinct style from an American film despite its subtitles. This doesn't. It actually has the look, mood, and feel of a film that could have been made here in America (by ignoring the subtitles part)... which is why I wonder why Fincher decided to remake this. I'm sure the material interests him but unlike Let The Right One In, this doesn't feel too un-mainstream for the general public. In fact, if one was to disregard that it has subtitles I would actually think it was made here. It was a very good film, but I I don't know how Fincher can expand or differentiate his film with this. That means I hope he does different things with it. Let Me In might have had like the same storyline and the same dialogue many times but it certainly had a distinctive tone and atmosphere that applied to itself only.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"A Promising Start, Thanks To Noomi Rapace's Show-Stealing Performance.","The 1st feature of the Millennium Trilogy, adapted from Stieg Larsson's novel of the same name, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is an ingeniously crafted mystery that expertly manages to retain its enigmatic atmosphere, tense feel & disturbing themes from start to finish by presenting its dark story in an unflinching manner and is as merciless as the subject it deals with.It tells the story of an infamous journalist who teams up with a young, tattooed & wildly eccentric computer hacker to investigate the case of a woman who inexplicably went missing 40 years ago without any trace. But the further they advance with the case, the more they put their lives on risk as the family that employed them is prepared to go to any lengths to protect its appalling secrets.Brilliantly directed & certainly not compromised in any manner, this Swedish thriller is an absolutely scarring experience with its brutal take on rape & violence and features quality level of craftsmanship in almost every single aspect of its filmmaking. Yet the best thing about The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is undeniably the terrific performances from its entire cast that provides this trilogy the promising start it needed.Noomi Rapace stars as Lisbeth Salander on whom the entire novel series is based on and is absolutely sensational, ruthless & magnificent in her given role. Michael Nyqvist also does a very good job as Mikael Blomkvist. The performances by the supporting cast is also impressive & believable which further helped in making the drama more captivating.On an overall scale, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is an excellent transition of Larsson's most famous novel on the silver screen and even though it might appear a bit too overlong in the end, for what it's worth, this film just works.

Whilst a few unwanted tracks are avoided for the paucity of time, new dimensions are incorporated for character-depth. And it works, a big pat on the back for the screenplay.To a large extent all the actors breath life into their respective portfolio. It cannot be refuted that Noomi Rapace (""Lisbeth"") takes the top-spot as she steals the show. Mikael (Mikael Blomkvist) is next in line. The actor who played Henrik Venger comes across quite regal yet emotionally frail patriarch. The actor who donned the cap of Martin Vanger had potential to push the envelope.The locations used in the movie is apt. Background score is engaging. The narrative used to translate the murder mystery in the book is lucid yet effective.In the past there were Dan Brown, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings and now the new word for hype is the ""Millenium"" series which has put Sweden on the world map. And finally it goes without saying that comparison are bound to be drawn with the American version, and one can safely profess that the Swedish version will stand to a good fight.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A psychological thriller,"A psychological thrillerA crime/psycho thriller based on an adaptation of a novel that the director does well in this difficult film. This film is one of the films of recent years, after which two films were made in the continuation of this film. This movie has received a lot of attention and is suitable for those interested in the psychology of cinema. The soundtrack tries to create an atmosphere of dread and although it succeeds in this, the soundtrack seems to be overdone. In 2011, David Fincher adapted the same novel and made a movie with the same title. Definitely, the success of this movie can be effective in making it.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A very good and intense mystery thriller.,"Reading a bit here, it seems to be a key to enjoying this film is NOT reading the book or seeing the Swedish movie.This is one very well structured and intense mystery thriller. It boarders on over-the-top in terms of adult theme but I was riveted and intrigued every step of the way. The performances are incredible and Rooney Mara deserves every bit of praise that she has generated for her portrayal of this complex and troubled character. There are a few logic flaw moments but they don't hinder the film at all. I do like that they gave us what amounts to a sequel tacked on to the end of the movie. Once the main plot is resolved, we get a resolution to a secondary plot that I didn't think they would go in to so thoroughly. It was like watching a later director's cut version of the film without having to wait for the DVD. That's what happens when a studio let's a big name director release what he wants, good for them.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Better ? Maybe, but some details needs is a bit out of context","Trust the Hollywood to bring in the big guns, Daniel Craig, Christopher Plummer to hopefully make a better movie. I admit the whole story run quite smoothly, not to say that the original Swedish version is bad. I would say they are comparable. If you read the novel and saw the Swedish version, you get the chance to see and make comparison.Some of the minor details are really annoying. One example; I do not think that a Swedish girl in has a diary entry written in English, specially when you considered that the writer of the diary is a 14 or 16 years old girls. I know they have a good education in Sweden, but.... come on, it is more logical to have a teenage girl writing her diary in her own mother tongue.Of course I suspect there is a bit of commercialism on the movie. Apple computer for one thing is shown so many times in the movie. Coincident ? I don't believe so, but this minor details in my opinion ruins the movie. I don't remember seeing something similar in the original movie, but you know Hollywood.... why not sell some advertising space if you can....Anyway, if you have some free minutes to waste, this is not a bad movie to watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Convoluted Swedish Mystery,Good production but overly long. Too long for a mystery thriller. Slow start and slow end. It doesn't enthrall as much as it should. Will watch the Swedish version. To see how it compares.,7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Lisbeth!! What is best in life!?,"Lisbeth!! What is best in life!? I just finished reading the trilogy and this morning figured out that this movie series will be a better remake of Conan the Barbarian than the actual remake of Conan the Barbarian. Conan and Lisbeth each have their lives take a serious wrong turn at an early age. About a decade later opportunities arise to quest after a longed for revenge. In the process, each in their own way, becomes the most ferociously powerful hacker of their age. When Lisbeth cracks open a Macbook Pro I know that somebody somewhere is going to get cleaved fully in half, as sure as if Mr Olympia went totally berserk with a razor sharp broadsword. She even gets the opportunity to do some damage with an ax in true Barbarian style. Each communicates with dirty looks and mono-syllables if there is any anything communicated at all. All this silence and brooding is what was missing from the new Conan. It's like some black hole of hate, nothing escapes - especially not small talk. You should look at Lisbath/Conan and feel that here is someone who can destroy you at will. You will never ever get on Lisbeth/Conan's good side, don't even try.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The error of omission,"This is a very fine movie by David Fincher. It does live up to the medias expectation. The movie greets you with an extraordinary intro, the kind of high octane pictures one expects from a Bond movie. Beginning and end, a cliffhanger in the emotional sense are both finely crafted. Once the participants are established the plot runs its underailed course. Craig displays the curious but tarnished investigator on a limp, Mara is the taciturn girl genius tipping the scales.This movie can be looked at from two perspectives: an American and a European. While the American version is honed to please the semi-savy blockbuster crowd, another Fincher that regurgitates Larsons book One in a digestible way, the ever depressed Europeans might find it lacking.Marrow and grit where leached from the deep-set reality that middle class is craving for when they commit to an evening of crime. Don't complicate your life watching the original, it will leave you even more distressed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Good thriller - proof that remake aren't always bad?,"I can't really justify my title. I confess... I haven't seen the original Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, so I can't compare how the American version fares.If you haven't read the book or seen the original (like me), it's about a disgraced journalist who enlists the help of a slightly emotionally unstable computer hacker to help him solve a murder that's been troubling a millionaire for decades. And it's fun. As it's the first in the trilogy, you don't need to have read the books first. Everything is explained and neatly wrapped up at the end (will there also be a US sequel? We will have to wait and see).It is on the long side, so you might want to allocate a good two and a half hours to watching it.It's worth it though - it could be because David Fincher directed it, but I found it pretty similar to Se7en.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Ill-fitting,"I've nearly watched this several times, and when I actually did watch it last night, the intro really made me think I wasn't going to like it... Visually, the intro reminded me of (the awesome) Daredevil intro., but sadly only because of the slick graphics and 'flowing liquid'.. Musically it made me expect some kind of fast-paced dark, violent action thriller. It's like a frenetic, dark Bond intro. The film is more moody, and apart from a few scenes, generally much less frantic.They got a good, 'meaty' story going with Lisbeth I thought, but then spoiled it by almost forgetting about it. There was a particularly awful scene involving her, which I thought they'd play out more, but she dealt with it in her own way, then there was only a brief return to it later on.. I don't see the point. It wasn't part of her history: it just happened.. and it didn't seem to affect her much: her relationship with Mikael could've been much more interesting if they'd weaved that into her character. As it was, I wish I hadn't seen it. There could have been more to Mikael's character too. I believe that it would have worked better if their relationship was platonic: he could have been the guardian that she never appeared to have had.I dislike unnecessary violence, etc. in films. It often seems to be added in to please certain audiences, and I feel like that about some of the scenes in this. Overall, it was okay, but why do this remake? Apparently the Swedish version is pretty good. This version even had most of the actors doing Swedish accents.. except 'Bond' who didn't bother.. I got a little lost with all the similar names. The ending I found sad, but overall a bit disappointing. I just found several elements ill-fitting.I intend to watch the Swedish one at some point.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Better Than Expected,"After seeing Hollywood massacre Tinker , Tailor, last night, my expectations were very low going into another remake. However, this was a much better effort. Taken in its own right, the Hollywood version of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is a pretty good thriller - until the last 25 minutes, which where clearly tacked on to pave the way for the next installment. Still, the story moved along with a nice brisk pace. Sometimes too brisk. The other obvious problem is the failure to make the tangled Vanger family tree clear. Most of the time, I had no idea how the various family members were related. It was very confusing.As Hollywood remakes go, it was good try. But they just could help selling out. I guess they assume that the US public couldn't take someone as edgy and threatening to middle class values as the original Salander. Compared to original version, the movie suffers badly because Hollywood took a lot of the edges off Lisabeth Salander. They kept most of the surface features, but underneath she was a very different character than the Lisabeth from the original. In the original, she was clearly a hacker. In the Hollywood version, she portrayed more socially acceptably as a researcher, who, by the way, could get around computer security. This was minor compared to the character transformation. The only shot of her in the spiked hair is in the beginning of the Hollywood, in what you might call a half spike. You never see the full Lisabeth punk look. They completely gilded her menace, and most of all, her strength, independence and her ""I don't care"" attitude. The final scene was 100% contrary her nature in the original. It was a classic Hollywood sell out. They just couldn't handle the Lisabeth from the original.Part of the problem was Rooney Mara, who seemed like a nice girl from the suburbs in a costume and not a like a feral survivor who would set her father on fire and extract violent revenge on whoever crossed her. Try as she could, she just wasn't believable when she says ""I'm crazy."" Her features are too regular. She looks too normal. In contrast, Noomi Repace has those angular features that make her look like she's ready to taser you any moment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A Labyrinthine plot with a protracted conclusion !!! Kudos...,"The girl with a Dragon Tattoo is a 2011 mystery thriller film having incredibly dark and violent subject matter based on Steig Larsson's Swedish novel which goes by the same name. The movie stars Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara in pivotal roles. The director David Fincher had to use his often-used tool of perfection to avoid the film being a disappointment since the novel hyped and he has succeeded in every form. The movie has a labyrinthine plot with the scenes shot at beautiful landscapes with Jeff Cronenweth's cinematography portraying the dark interiors. It all commences with Swedish reporter Mikael Blomkvist (Craig) losing a calumny case put up against him by a businessman Hans-Erik Wennerström. He is soon assigned by Henrik Vagner to unravel an unsolved mystery of his grandniece Harriet who vanished 40 years ago and wasn't found since. In return he is promised a piece of information which can prove useful in defaming Wennerström. Meanwhile Lisabeth Salander (Mara), a bisexual, computer hacker and a researcher who bears psychological wounds of harsh upbringing is assigned to a new guardian Nils Bjurman, a lawyer by profession. This socio-path hacker suffers physical and sexual abuses from hands of Nilis who starts taking advantage of his position. It is depressing to watch the scene where Lisabeth is raped miserably by Nilis and is forced to take brutal revenge as a counter-attack. Here lies the speciality of Salander whose acts of vengeance showcase her absolute ability to expel evil with the help of evil. Fincher makes sure that the plot generates a wait to see Mikael and Lisabeth's life collide as initially their lives start running parallel to each other. Mikael who is on the verge of investigating the lost Harriet case puts up a demand for an investigator to assist him to solve the mystery. Sexual and physical abuse from hands of man who she thinks she can trust leads Lisabeth to join hands with Mikael. Fincher captures the essence of the novel in a truthful manner. For those who haven't read the novel, this film is a roller coaster ride showing murder, corruption, family secrets and inner demons of the two associates working on a 40-year old mystery. The typical procedural focus on topography is deflected into archival topography - the island's magnificent and reticulated landscape is pulverized into monochromatic, snowy ambiance. Craig diverges from his James Bond persona and does a completely new character thus displaying his excellent acting skills. Mara does a totally fantastic job as the girl with a dragon tattoo. A 8/10 for this another Fincher-made masterpiece.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
