They said you were a giant. They said you can crush a man's skull with one hand.,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.I didn't know man could build such things.Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again.

"As a matter of fact, Maximus, I AM entertained.","Gladiator is the best bread and circus. A moving and very entertaining action epic with Russel Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix at the top of their game.I absolutely love Joaquin Phoenix in this movie. He's the kind of villain you love to hate. So pathetic and childish. So ruthless and creepy. Just right amount of cartoonish. I wanted to punch him in the face.It can be corny and it drags a bit during the escape plan part of the plot, but it has enough emotion and brutal violence to keep the audience entertained, and that's what a good gladiator match should be.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"20 Years On, It Still Rewards And Grips","20 years on, the first DVD I bought is still a barnstorming, thrilling ride. There's so much to recommend this - Lisa Gerrard & Hans Zimmer's iconic score, the canny casting of Joaquin Phoenix as a foil for Crowe; the realisation that I quote this film in everyday conversation far more than I thought I did. If it should have won the Oscars is a moot point - this is another of Ridley Scott's superb worldbuilding - one of his primary film-making skills, giving us a Rome that feels recognisable yet still a break from the clich√©'s that had seeped in to popular culture before this. That the film's status was boosted by the DVD boom as it made its way to home release is undeniable, but this remains a film that thrills, absorbs and grips.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Spellbinding.,"One of the best films of a generation, it's a bold claim, but Gladiator truly is that good.

Great,"Gladiator is a historical epic from director Ridley Scott. After being betrayed by the new Caesar, Roman general Maximus is sold into slavery as a gladiator where he rises to fame as a people's champion and finds an opportunity to exact his revenge. Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, and Connie Nielsen lead the cast and deliver strong performances. Additionally, the gladiator fights are especially dynamic and exciting, featuring several different styles of combat. The costumes and sets are also remarkably well-done, and create a vivid depiction of ancient Rome. And, Hans Zimmer's score does an excellent job at capturing the tone of the film. Thrilling and action-packed, Gladiator delivers a compelling tale. ""Are you not entertained?!""",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Breathtaking!,"Once again, Director Ridley Scott proves to be as professional as one can be. The recreation of ancient Rome is splendid, with all its magnificent buildings and atmosphere and he is able to show with all brightness the greatness of the Roman Empire, with its political problems and military discipline, and love and treason, of hate and jealousy, that still have a place in our world today. But the story has a glow of its own, to which all the beautiful scenery (believe me, it's awesome!!!) and great cinematography are just balancing factors. The plot is a rich one, that is as dynamic as it is present. He once again, after Blade Runner, 1492, and others helps us visit the depths of the human soul, which remains the same over all our historical and social experience. Even the fights, are displayed in such a way that all the blood is quite discrete, but still, making us feel like screaming and jumping out of our seats. I would also like to point out the performances of the cast, that is surprisingly good. We have some actors and actresses, who are not Hollywood icons, but are are greatly able to move the audience among screams and tears. All in all, we have guys like Russel Crowe, who are coming out to be part of a new and extremely promising harvest of people who are making each time more fans around the world. Well, you should see for yourself!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A class act!!,"I am usually worried that I'm in for a big let-down when I am looking forward to a film as much as I was to this one.  This time however, I was very pleasantly suprised, when Gladiator not only fulfilled but surpassed my expectations.  It's a brilliant film, which (while containing weaknesses such as a script which wasn't quite as good as it could have been, and one climactic scene which completely changes, and ruins, the ending) manages to engage your heart and mind.The performances are without exception excellent (although the accents may distract a bit, there is such a wide variety of them).  I must single out for commendation Mr. Phoenix, who despite his youth manages to portray a character with such conviction that you never for a moment doubt his interpretation.  His physical performance is as good as his mental one.The film rests firmly on the (extremely attractive and capable) shoulders of one Russell Crowe.  In a tour-de-force performance, he manages to convey a man (not a superhuman) with frailties and doubts and fears and heart.  I cannot convey to you how brilliant this man's performance was.  If anyone else had been this character, the film would have rated at best a five out of ten.Kudos to Russell Crowe, and to Ridley Scott, for managing to keep this film on a level with humanity, rather than one in which the characters become killing machines.A must see, five stars out of five.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Can't be missed!,"""Gladiator"" definitely is a classic film as it combines a simple, but moving, story with beautiful scenery, filming, direction and score ¬ñ it is truly a ""complete"" movie.I am mostly compelled with the beautiful script which in a way reminds me of poetry, though it is still everyday language. I love the acting portrayed by the late Oliver Reed and also Richard Harris. Russell Crowe, Djimon Housou and Joaquin Phoenix are also superb and the parts suit them perfectly. There are also a number of less ""popular"" artists who also deserve a big ""bravo"". Amongst them I have to mention ex-Mr Universe Ralph Moeller who is mostly used as the comic relief of the movie. In Gladiator we can also the beautiful and popular Maltese TV Star and actress Ruth Frendo, who although has a small part, she is totally brilliant and outstanding.Actually I got to IMDb while I was looking for her name on the internet, in fact on IMDb she has some very stunning photos. I was lucky to meet Ruth Frendo whilst she was filming in another Maltese production. Ruth Frendo is not only a gorgeous and talented actress but she is also amazingly intelligent and very down-to-earth. We will definitely be seeing more of her work in the future...The scenery used for ""Gladiator"" is brilliant ¬ñ and the opening battle scene is definitely one of my top favorite scenes. The modern camera technique contrasts sharply to the brutality of the gladiators actions and blood shed during the movie; and I love the light contrasts thanks to the lenses which most definitely have been used to create a surreal feel to the entire movie.""Gladiator"" deserves all the awards and great reviews it has received, and for those of you who still haven't gone and watched it ¬ñ I can assure you that it will be well worth your time and money. So go on and rent it now!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"A nail biting, intense modern epic!","Most films require that the viewer identifies with the character to truly be engrossed with the film. If you can't feel something for the character, than the audience is lost.Luckily, in Ridley Scott's case, Russel Crowe is so captivating and convincing as a general loved by his troops and as a slave loved by the people that the movie really works. Possibly one of the greatest actors today, Crowe carries this epic film on his very capable shoulders.Not to say that he is the only reason this works. The supporting cast, most notably Connie Neilsen, buoy the film to new perspectives.Jacquin Phoenix definitely captures the egotisitcal persona he should display, stealing every scene he's in. Phoenix will surely be put on the map with Gladiator.But the real shining star in this film are the incredible action sequences which jolt the viewer right in with the opening sequences, as Maximus' true worth to the Roman Empire is displayed. Scott's camera work within these completed sequences takes a modern twist that really works for the gruesome scenes.Crowe will now get the respect he deserves for this collosal performance. Gladiator makes the most of its 2 and a half hours, marking a triumphant comeback for the long forgotten epics of the classic days of film. ALL HAIL MAXIMUS!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Edge of Your Seat Fun!,"Great Story!  Great Writing!  Great Acting!  Great Directing!  Great Score! This movie has it all.  I especially enjoyed the mood of the film.  Even though it has a lot of action, there is a subtle elegance throughout the picture that gives it great style.  The movie flows effortlessly from scene to scene, while at the same time creating wonderful intensity and nail-biting excitement.The acting in the movie more than lives up to expectations.  Russell Crowe is brilliant in his role as Maximus, the ""general who became a slave, who became a gladiator, who defied an emperor.""  Crowe's intense style is perfect for the relentless determination and confidence of Maximus.  Joaquin Phoenix is equally wonderful in his role as Commodus, the corrupt emperor. He plays a great villain because he is able to give Commodus depth by showing certain vulnerable or fragile sides, while at the same time instantly transforming to let the ruthless nature of his volatile character shine.  It also helps that Joaquin has the classic Caesar look that works perfectly with his role.Connie Nielsen is also very good as Lucilla.  However, perhaps the two finest performances in the movie were given by a couple of acting veterans in supporting roles.  Richard Harris and Oliver Reed were exceptional in what will be remembered as crowning achievements at the end of their careers.  Harris was perfect as Marcus Aurelius, the aging Caesar who reflects upon his life and contemplates how the world will remember him. And Reed, especially, gave my personal favorite performance in the movie as Proximo, the trainer for the gladiators.  The way he spoke about the life of a gladiator, the splendor of Rome, and the ""thrill of the Coliseum"" really added excitement and anticipation during the viewing of the movie.Gladiator is filled with many memorable moments that one would need to see more than once to fully appreciate.  The excitement felt for me when Rome is first shown in all its wonder and marvel is my favorite scene.  But the whole movie is a rush!  Hans Zimmer provides the absolute perfect score to capture the different moods in the movie.  Ridley Scott sets the perfect tone with his artistic and creative directing.  I would recommend it to anyone who can stomach intensity and enjoy an epic story for the ages.  Next to Braveheart, this movie is the greatest of all-time!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Disturbing, but beautifully made and well acted, as well as jaw-dropping scenery!","Ridley Scott rarely disappoints with his films. All of them, including the unjustly-maligned Legend, are visually stunning and just show the director's artistic genius. Gladiator should be up there as one of the best films he's done, if not the best. Almost everything on screen is very graphic, making some scenes upsetting to watch, but the visuals are just outstanding. The music score by Hans Zimmer just adds to the drama that is already there in the script. which is well written and rather Shakespearean. The performances were brilliant, especially Joaquin Pheonix and Oliver Reed. Russell Crowe is wholly convincing in the title role, and Richard Harris and Connie Nielson are also excellent. The costumes are brilliant, as well as the sets. In conclusion, Gladiator is a near masterpiece, only marred by some upsetting scenes. 9/10 Bethany Cox.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
One of the Greatest Movies Ever,"I love history, and to me, Gladiator is a masterpiece. It is the most accurate picture of the Roman Empire Hollywood has ever put out.  People declare Spartacus a masterpiece, but Gladiator far outdoes Spartacus in quality.  The costuming, the acting, the screenplay, the scenery, and the fighting styles made me think that I had traveled back to 180 A.D. Russell Crowe is a true Hollywood tough guy, and he is superb in this movie. Joaquin Phoenix is outstanding as a villain, one of the best in movie history.  He played his character as if it were a psychologist's dream case. Connie Nielsen plays one of the strongest female characters that I have ever seen.  The choreographer of the action sequences was brilliant. Ridley Scott did an outstanding job in recreating the Empire, including the multitude of ethnic groups within the Empire and accurately depicting everyday life.  If you're looking for insight into what the Roman Empire was like, this is a perfect depiction.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Nice movie but is this original,"Movie is technically very fine i have watched in theater twice and i like it much as lots of turks but sometime after the reason why we loved this movie became clear this was only a western look over an old Turkish movie series Tarkan... Maximus was so Turkic that he was wearing lamb fur(lamb was introduced by Huns to Europe) instead of bright armors of Romans,Like Tarkan he rides along his wolf, his family has been murdered by his foes ... you can claim that these may be inspirations of Ridley Scott from Tarkan but there are some scenes taken directly from Tarkan movies...1- Maximus fights a big German guy - Tarkan's fight against Giant Orso both are under snow.. 2- After the fight in arena, emperor orders death- neither Tarkan nor Maximus kill the victims. 3-The scene of birds over Rome 4-The appear order and camera movements in the arenaat least the final is different, Maximus dies though Tarkan is immortal",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Today I saw a movie become more powerful . . .,"The movie is the story of Maximus (Crowe), a general who leads the Roman army to victory over Germania in the beginning of the movie. The dying emperor of Rome, Marcus Aurelius, is watching this battle.The emperor's son, Commodus, then arrives with his sister Lucilla, and it is discovered that Commodus fully expects to be announced the new emperor of Rome in a few days. Aurelius, however, has other plans--he wants to make Maximus emperor, and requests that of the general, who wants nothing more than to go home to his family.I went into this movie having just watched Ben-Hur in my film studies class and having watched an episode of Xena only a couple of weeks earlier that featured the story of Marc Anthony and Cleopatra. So you could say I was in the perfect mindset to watch a ""sword-and-sandal"" movie. I wasn't sure what to expect, having somehow avoided all the hype that accompanied this movie. But I was not disappointed.Gladiator features some wonderful cinematography by John Mathieson. The battle scenes are very graphic. (This movie is not for the squeamish, that's for sure.) There were some scenes in particular that really struck me, such as when Crowe appears to be floating over the ground very fast.  The use of color and color tones added a great deal to the mood of the movie. Excellent.The script was being written and re-written as the filming was going on, yet it doesn't show that the actors had no idea how the movie was going to end when they began filming.  The acting is terrific. Russell Crowe is wonderfully cast as Maximus. Many reviewers agree that he is now officially a star. Joaquin Phoenix also proves his mettle as the emotionally troubled Commodus, whose behavior and emotion toward his sister could give anyone the creeps. Connie Nielsen makes you believe that, as Lucilla, she really is torn between natural loyalty to her brother and doing what she knows is right. Oliver Reed, in his last performance, is memorable in his role of Proximo, the former gladiator who is the owner of Maximus and brings him to Rome.  In short, the actors were brilliant in their roles, not over-acting, but giving subtle, strong performances.The script itself is very good.  Although some elements are a little hard to believe--the fact that no one recognizes Maximus when he's a slave?--this film calls for a willing suspension of disbelief, which one would happily comply with.  (It's really no fun to nitpick such a movie.)It's true that this movie does pretty much follow the Braveheart formula. However, this movie includes some elements, such as the cinematography and the incredibly graphic battle scenes (one reviewer likened it to Saving Private Ryan, ""only better""), that are spectacular in itself. Overall, a great movie that I highly recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Cecil B DeMille eat your heart out,"The epic blockbuster returns with the 21st Century's answer to Cecil B DeMille, Ridley Scott and his dramatic tale of courage and revenge, GLADIATOR - ""the general who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator, the gladiator who defied an emperor"".Once a great roman General, and as good as adopted son of Marcus Aurelius Caesar (Harris), Maximus (Crowe) is forced into exile by Commodus (Phoenix), heir to the throne, after the death of Marcus. Saved from death by slavers, he is purchased for use as a gladiator by Proximo (Reed) and ends up in the arena of all arena's, the Colloseum, where he proves unbeatable under his guise as ""The Spaniard"".And with a budget of over $100m, Scott certainly delivers the goods. GLADIATOR transcends the notion of 'blockbuster' that we have become accustomed to in the age of electronic and special effects wizardry and instead offers a good old fashioned action film along the lines of Spartacus and and Ben Hur. Not only are we drawn into an archetypal story that contains all the classic elements a filmgoer could dream of (love, loss, courage, despair, good triumphing over evil etc etc) - also on offer is a visual feast of cinematic painting after painting - a rich tapestry of images that are breathtaking and ultimately visually satisfying. From the plains of Germania, to the desert stronghold of Zuchobar, and finally to great Rome herself, John Mathiesion, the cinematographer is to be commended highly for his general inventiveness and ability to capture so much on film. The opening  battle scene is superb as a cast of thousands erupt across the screen and provide an indication that we are about to see a film that pays incredible attention to detail throughout its entirety. In every way, Scott has created a world for us that scuttles films of similar epic undertakings (and budgets!) and sends them to their dooms at the bottom of the murky depths of film history where they belong.The cast is generally very strong. Crowe proves himself very suitable to the task with a great emotional range and depth of character. His accent ocassionally bugged me (as did the mish mash of accents on offer - but that is I guess a legacy of 'internationally casted films'), but this aside, he was well and truly up to the task. Phoenix is also excellent as the disturbed Commodus, as is Nielson as Lucilla, the daughter of Marcus who ""should have been a son"" and finds herself torn between loyalty to her brother and doing what is 'right'. The old guard thesps of Harris, Reed and Jacobi (Grachus) are uniformly strong as supporting characters, and Spencer Treat Clark (Lucius) does a fine job as the young heir to the throne.Add to this great cast excellent editing and post production work, and an intricate soundscape (including a magnificent Hans Zimmer score), and you have a film that, despite its length, was highly palatable and had me in there from beginning to end. A must see.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A Throwback To The Epics Of The '60s,"An intense Roman epic, a la ""Ben-Hur"" or ""Spartacus,"" it was nice to see something like this made again. It had been since the 1960s that we had seen a 3-hour extravaganza like this.Like Ben-Hur, this is a story of a successful man who loses everything thanks to an evil man, and then has to fight his way back up to seek revenge on that man and to obtain his freedom back. It's a tried-and-true formula. This movie doesn't go to excess on the violence as some of the other more recent epic films did, such as ""Braveheart"" or ""The Patriot.""The acting is excellent, beginning with Russell Crowe, who has established himself as one of the best actors of today. Joaquin Phoenix also put himself ""on the map"" as an actor with his portrayal of the evil ""Commodus."" He's so annoying you want to slap that sucker, which means he's doing a good job acting.

Victory of production over a lousy script,"There is an unwritten rule in movie making that if you have an excellent script it doesn't matter how you film it. If you have a lousy script - then everything else matters, the direction, the cinematography, the acting, the music... ""Gladiator"" is an epitome of the latter half of that rule. The case where direction, music, acting and art direction completely redeemed a crappy story.For me it took watching it in German overdubbing. As I don't speak German there was nothing to detract me from visuals and music. And it's a new experience on another level. But more on that later. First the crappy part. The story.Make no mistake, whether you care about history or not, this is a horrible script. It's taking huge (and quite unacceptable) liberties with the period it purports to portray, it's unconvincing even on its own terms, the dialog is pretty much high school and in its core it's a predictable revenge story told a zillion times before. Apparently (according to a documentary about Hollywood screenwriters) only Russell Crowe didn't know what turd the script was so he contributed himself with the juvenile ""husband of the dead wife"" speech.Ridley Scott and his crew apparently knew what stinker they had to work with and did their best to defeat it with excellence in all areas and actually made two films in one.On the surface it's a revenge story. The hero, a favorite army general turned gladiator, seeks revenge against a young emperor, who had general's family killed during the tumultuous succession to the throne. The military battles and the gladiatorial bouts required for this aspect of the movie are done both to tremendous detail and on a grand scale. With the help of CGI they are seen in all their glory and gore. Some accuse Scott of shying away from action but his direction shows everything one needs to see. Yes, the cuts are brief, the camera sometimes doesn't follow through, but the editing is pure poetry and you miss nothing. Cinematography-wise every frame is shot in a way that you could just hang it on a wall as a nice picture. Costumes and scenery are impeccable. A revenge story, yes, but well worth watching.But on another level ""Gladiator"" plays out like a remake of ""Fall of a Roman Empire"". But it's not in the script. It's in the mood set again by production. This other story is about the decline and death of classical Rome and its ideals. There is simple yet effective symbolism to express it, the play on dark and light and the sunrise-sunset arc. The movie starts with a battle at dawn, the way the Rome itself had once dawned, fighting. There is an ideal Roman hero, valiant and dutiful, there's a typical Roman villain, clandestine and scheming. Hero does his best in the light, the villain does his worst in the dark, whenever they swap environments during the movie they fail miserably. The story ends at sunset, symbolizing the end of the Empire itself, and although an uplifting speech is given at that point it is defeated by the setting sun.The feeling of the doom is constantly emphasized by melancholic music. The dreamlike experience of the main character who is already dead but doesn't yet know it is enhanced when he finally visits Rome and the city is an idealistic, blown in proportions version of itself. The script may be a complete falsification of history, but the feeling of decline one gets when watching those scenes is probably completely faithful.So forget the story and the closing speech. Watch and listen the movie. The Roman Empire is living and dying once more before your very eyes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
What a sad waste,"It's starts out like any good epic should with a masterfully filmed and executed exciting battle sequence that sets up the audience for one of those rare Hollywoodian confections that are both entertaining and artsy. Unfortunately, it all goes downhill from there. It isn't the performers faults since every single one of them give amazing, emotional, even, at times, riveting performances (the kinds you should find in better movies) and who give the whole picture more class than it deserves. It isn't Hanz Zimmer's nor Lisa Gerrard's fault since they have composed a score that's almost (and I do mean almost) as unforgettable as the Godfather's. And it certainly isn't Ridely Scott's fault since he yet again succeeds in immersing the audience in the world he has created. No, the ones who are to blame are the people who wrote the saccharine, clich√©d, soap-opery script and who, in the process, have wasted all of this incredible talent. They should be fed to the lions. It's an entertaining B-movie that could have been a classic. Just like Titanic in a way.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Special effects and powerful acting make Gladiator an epic.,"I borrowed this movie on DVD, but I wish I had seen it in the theater for it would have been a lot more fun and powerful there. Despite this, Gladiator is one of the most powerful and moving films I've ever seen. The plot goes so smooth together, as well as the acting and the terrific musical score. Director Ridley Scott puts all effort into making this film an epic, and he does just that. I'd have to say that anyone who likes Ridley Scott (I sure do) should see this. It is a lot like Ridley's other movies (Black Hawk Down was also amazing). If you can stand a little bit--well, ok a LOT of blood and gore, then you should see this. Russell Crowe shows an excellent performance like no other. I don't think there's one bad movie that Ridley Scott has made or that Russell Crowe has acted in. The fact that the brutal battles involving innocent slaves in this film actually happened in real life centuries ago makes it even more interesting and powerful. Emperor Commodus is a truely evil and life-like villian who shows a lot of his wits in attempts to get his revenge against Maximus.Ridley Scott went to many different locations to shoot this film to make it real, and he does. The film is set in Rome, and it looks just like it. You feel as if you are there in the crowd, hearing them cheer and cheer to see the death. To some of you, this may sound a little barbaric, and believe me the film is VERY barbaric and brutual, however it teaches a very strong lesson of what happens when an economy turns as violent as Rome was. Ridley Scott goes to many lengths to make this movie real, because even though the characters are fictitious, all of this really did happen. Innocent people had to go through brutual fighting while thousands of people cheered for either their death or the enemy's death. If you were an inexperienced fighter, chances are you would get killed. But the strange thing is that Rome LOVED this. People came from all over to see these fights and to see the blood that was shed, that is why you can't blame the characters in this film for being so forlorn and saddened the whole time. The film itself is very dark. The theme is dark and the ending is dark. From beginning to end there is excessive violence (for those action movie-goers, this is a movie for you). But if the violence is concerning you, don't let it. The special effects make the movie great, but it's the acting and storyline that make it spectacular. HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED for anyone who wants a good time. Definitely makes you think. ***** out of *****.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

We need movies like Gladiator again,"I seriously doubt anyone who stumbled upon this really needs me to tell them why they should watch ""Gladiator"". So instead I'll just use my 600 required characters to lament the state of current Hollywood and the death of films like this one.Despite its incredible success, ""Gladiator"" sort of represents the end of an era. Soon after its release the age of the comic book film would take over Hollywood and epics like this one would be cast aside as originality and creativity were replaced by a cookie cutter assembly line filled with brands and I. P.'s.There's also the matter of the cultural shift that has taken place over the last quarter century. Not with society at large necessarily, but certainly within Hollywood. Terms like ""Toxic Masculinity"" are often thrown around to describe anything that even remotely involves men behaving like, well, men. Therefore contemporary portrayals of men are often neutered, rendering them as either soft and weak or big and dumb.But as super hero/comic book burnout combined with companies like Disney gnawing every scrap of meat off of the bones of their once mighty brands, I believe that audiences are quietly thirsting for the return of films like ""Gladiator"". Big. Epic. And yes, masculine.Sometimes we don't know what we need until we find it, and I hope that some producer or director out there has the foresight, talent and drive to fill this vacuum before movies are shoved aside by video games for good.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Nitpicking is only criticism,"There is so little to find wanting in this film and not wanting to merely repeat its many deserved praises, all I can do is question a couple of historical points.It is unlikely that a Roman general would be sold into slavery and forced to fight in the arena. Exiled, yes. Killed maybe. Asked to commit suicide to retain his property, most likely.It is unlikely that he would return to find his family crucified, of all things. Romans were very specific about who got crucified and why. Romans usually avoided it, no matter how cruel the tyrant(?) was.Roman legionnaires would NEVER have a tattoo unless they were barbarians who got one BEFORE joining a legion. Marking or mutilating the human body was expressedly anti- Roman. No statue or depiction exists of a main-period Roman showing a body-marking. The bonding feature the writer was attempting was an inappropriate borrowing from the 20th century German SS.Great entertaining movie nonetheless.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Pretentious and Mediocre,"Evaluating opinion of this movie by the 'Hated It' selection, I lost count of the number of contributors who gave it just one star. I thought they were being unnecessarily 'Roman' in their ruthlessness, but the result does show how disappointed so many viewers were and the extent to which this movie has polarised opinion.I diplomatically place myself somewhere in the middle.For me, scepticism set-in at the outset. That much-vaunted battle scene didn't sit right at all. In combat, the greatest Roman strength lay in the legion. The scrupulously drilled and disciplined foot-soldiers worked in unison, advancing upon enemies in their orderly units and maniples.Their Shields interlocked to create a mobile wall that could form-up on all flanks and even provide overhead protection. In between, they used their short, stabbing swords.The legions, then, were only at their best in the open. In dense forest, their advantages would have been squandered, any fight being a brawl upon the same terms as the enemy. Morover, their big Shields would have been an encumbrance and the short swords inadequate. A good Roman general drew the enemy out to fight on his terms, not the other way round. I'm not a scholar of Roman warfare; it may be there were occasions when Romans had no choice, but this is where the question marks began to pop-up. Check out the impeccable piece in 'Spartacus', where the Roman legions deploy by the textbook, drawing their enemy down from the hill. Perhaps Mr Scott felt that a more faithful rendering would seem like too much of a rip-off. In any case, this battle is quite incidental, and seems to exist only to grip the viewer's attention for the next couple of flatulent hours.Neither was I aware that the Roman army employed fire-bombs. It's not for me to say they didn't, but I have no reference to this tactic at all.I thought Ridley Scott made a futile attempt to create an 'arty' film. The frequent dream-like flashbacks to a hand running through spears of corn reminded me of the recurrent unicorn dream from his fascinating but equally pretentious 'Blade Runner'. From time to time there's even the same high-pitched warbling 'oriental' chorus, intended to project mood, but failing again. Some directors don't seem to realise that cinema-goers have memories.General Gruntus Maximus (Russel Crowe) surely got the easiest Oscar in history. He was believable as an uneducated slob in the way, perhaps, Spartacus should have been; but cerebral enough to be a general? I don't think so. And you don't rise to be a career general in an army whilst obsessing as a farmer about your harvest. You're either one, or the other.There was one particularly absurd scene in the arena when he was chopping-down competitors as quickly as they could be set against him. What then - weren't they trained gladiators, too? I was half-expecting him to begin walking sideways along the arena walls like 'Neo' from 'Matrixus'.As to the 'spectacle' of Rome; well, that was all just computer-generated hokum. The back-room boys can whip-up anything in that way now just by tapping a few keys, so what's the big deal? Check-out the 'real' thing in 'Fall Of The Roman Empire'.As with 'Titanic' and 'Pearl Harbour' a splendid opportunity was missed here to do something really wonderful, but because of flawed vision and misplaced directorial self-belief we finished up with mediocrity. Glorious mediocrity.Still, bread and circuses usually please the crowds.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A classic diamond in the rough,"Despite its predecessors, Gladiator has managed to hold its own against many box office hits of today.

Worth a watch",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Is Crowe the 'next action hero?',"Germania, 150 AD, the setting of Gladiator's opening scene. Far from the blazing sun and dazzlingly beauty of ancient Rome, Ridley Scott shoots the opening sequence in a subdued light. The Roman legions are nonetheless impeccably turned out as they face the comparatively disorganised rabble that inhabits this miserable environment. Caesar's soldiers seem somewhat misplaced here. However, Russell Crowe is at home in this environment of knee-deep mud and merciless snow. He commands the screen with all the virtues of his motto: ¬ëStrength and Honour.'The plot, with its hero-to-zero-to-hero nature, runs through Gladiator's every vein. As General Maximus, Russell Crowe is welcomed by Marcus Aurelius Caesar (Richard Harris) to take the Roman throne as Emperor of a new Republic. All does not run smoothly however as mislead heir to the throne Commodus (Phoenix) takes over Rome with ill-gotten domination, having dispatched his own Father. Maximus is cast out to find his family murdered and his Spanish farm burnt to the ground. Taken in as a slave by Proximo (Reed), Maximus becomes a Gladiator and starts his journey to the Coliseum and revenge against Commodus.Scott's cast is powerful and he is not left wanting as powerful performances are delivered by all. Due to his untimely mid-production death, Oliver Reed is created in some scenes by the grace of computer graphics, which are as convincing as they come; sometimes making it difficult to differentiate between Reed himself and his computerised counterpart.It is, however, the supporting actors who create many of Gladiator's best dialogue-based scenes. In an accomplished demonstration of her acting ability as Lucilla, Connie Nielsen saves the occasional scene as Joaquim Phoenix shows us that he can ¬ëdo evil', but is less convincing when it comes to the more emotional qualities of his role.As a vehicle for the plot, Scott's beautifully created and highly symbolic (there is an image of fire in nearly every shot of the film) dialogue scenes are of a certain merit with digitally created backgrounds that encompass the meticulous nature of the Roman Empire. However, dialogue alone does not an epic movie make, and it is in the film's spectacular action sequences that Gladiator come into its own. Shot on location in Malta, Scott's first arena was built by an army of locals and commanded some 5000 extras (a large majority of whom were of a cardboard variety). All of this pales in comparison as we arrive in a digitally created Rome which makes some scenes in Ben Hur some somewhat small scale. The Coliseum is immense, both inside and out, and the computerised provides the electric atmosphere in which Crowe and his feline companions (four sizeable, and real, Bengal tigers) perform.The battle sequences are perfectly choreographed and shot as iconic masks and typically Roman chariots are abundant in their power and imagery. As swords clash and heads roll, Ridley Scott is triumphant in the application of special effects technology and his directorial prowess.Always one to embrace technology, Scott's views over Rome's landscape are reminiscent of the beautifully created cityscape of Blade Runner. This is a film that fears so little and boasts so much, even a lady archer being sliced clean in half by a spiked chariot wheel!All those involved with Gladiator should be delighted and confident with their creation, for indeed this is a convincing and enthralling display with epic proportions to take the wind from James Cameron's titanic sails.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Absolutely Brilliant,"I love when you haven't seen a great movie in five years and then happen to stumble on it on the perfect night to revisit it, somewhat forgetting much of it, or at least the affecting impact it can have on you. That was me with Gladiator recently.Most has already been said, so I want to just zoom in on a couple or parts and features. Before I do, it's a great and rarely acknowledged fact that although most of the story is fictionalized, in reality, Commodus was really infatuated with the Gladiator games; he also did indeed compete and corruptly fabricated his win-loss record. Outside of the Coliseum arena, he had a statue of himself enshrined that listed his record at something like 60 wins and no losses. However, he could rig any match he wanted and most historical accounts dispute he fought on that many matches- he may have been in a dozen or so, but doubtfully was he in that many. Also, while it would be cool if, like in the film, another gladiator fought him like that in the ring, in reality, it was Commodus' trainer that was supposedly responsible for his demise. This is interesting because while many of the story components are inaccurate, one might assume that Commodus' character was completely made up also, but he truly was a big fan and even competitor in the games.The staging of the scenery and background construction of Rome is absolutely brilliant and breathtaking. It makes you really feel like you're there in many scenes. How many movies can transport you back to experience legendary Rome two thousand years ago?Even more so brilliant is how not much has changed. Sure, our athletes don't fight to the death and now get paid sufficiently, but the relation and comparison to modern day sports events is vividly shown. The same is true for the politics- yeah, it's all in there in there. While the political components are not a deep dive, the film touches on enough philosophies and strategic realities to go a little and just enough beyond the surface to paint the picture that little has changed. There's corruption, schmoozing, contempt, grandstanding, loyalties, and nepotism.Phoenix is so entertaining to watch playing the sick, twisted, power hungry, bloodlusting emporer, especially when he's enjoying the battle of Carthage. He is truly outstanding in this role, arguably missing out on an early career, deserved Oscar award. While many of his scenes are disturbing, he is always riveting.This is a movie you will lose yourself in.The Battle of Carthage is truly awesome. This was a very elaborate and complex sequence with lots of moving parts, showing that director Scott wasn't just phoning it in. When the chariot crashes through the gate, you really feel the tides turn, like this isn't what Commodus and his organizers expected. Cutting back and forth to Commodus' reactions was a great decision and likewise with all the senators' and Connie Nielson's. That was my favorite match.My second favorite match was Tigris. What a spectacle it was having the tigers pop out from underground, and Commodus' disappointment again having thought he rigged Maximus' demise was again a great revelation.Every scene is well acted, even the behind the action scenes with Commodus and his sulister, Gracchus, and Proximo and Maximus.It's truly a classic and awesome film experience. Ridley Scott must have had a ""no bull----"" rule while making the movie because it really doesn't waste a second and with sequences like Carthage battle going right into the Commodus-Maximus confrontation, and then how quickly the film goes from battle to battle, it just feels like a filmmaker who is not screwing around. I think this has to be appreciated much more, as we know so many movies today waste time and meander.My only complaint was that we didn't get to see the promised, would-be invasion of Rome with Maximus escaping and returning with his five thousand soldiers. That would have been epic beyond epic. Instead, we get a good showdown. But to its credit, I'll give it this: Maximus at least kept half of his promise, and the end result was much the same since Commodus could no longer rule and the sister and Gracchus honored Aurelias' final wish (no invasion necessary in that regard, still I would've liked the action and suspense more).Even though many try to criticize the scripts simplicity, I disagree and find the dialogue and monologues to be quality drama and somewhat Shakespearean at times. Even the weaker scenes that were probably added are just drowned out in the action and serve their purpose to keep the audience informed.And make no mistake here: this is a visual movie, and there is much more said and conveyed in the close ups of the facial expressions of the main characters, from evil glances, to vengeful scowls, to shaking jaws, tearful eyes, frightened faces, mad bloodlusting tongue stick outs, and hopeful daydream-like optimistic smiles.We all know what's going on here, witnessing humanity at its' corrupted, animalistic worst and heroic, godly, and noble best. The end result is a masterpiece of visual, visceral spectacle and drama about one man's fall and rise by honor and heroism and another's rise and fall by corruption and cowardice, in front of the backdrop of one of the seven great wonders of the world. It doesn't get much more epic than this these days!I hope my review is merciful and you are all entertained!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

The film results to be a special remake to ¬®Fall of Roman Empire¬® directed by Antony Mann with Stephen Boyd , Sofia Loren and Christopher Plummer as Commodus , though is a little revisionist about characters , history and time when is developed the action . Before directing ¬®Robin Hood , Kingdom of heaven¬® films , director Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe teamed but with much bigger budget . The final product looked as although the actors learn the screenplay and decided the best issue was to take a good time and amuse themselves and both managed to stage some excellent action scenes .

Special mention to gladiator owner magnetically performed by Oliver Reed and Joaquin Phoenix as evil and crazed emperor in a sensationalistic interpretation .

Adequate Roman Epic,"There is much to appreciate about about this picture but at the same time there is much to castigate as well. What could have been a thoroughly involving story turns out to be crippled by a lean script, some very indecisive direction and choppy editing. Not to mention some bad casting in the form of Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius, a role which cries out to have been the last role played by Anthony Quinn.The film starts out well and looks bleakly authentic in its depiction of the pivotal battle in the wars between the barbarian tribes of Germania and the Roman Empire. But as the story gives way to 40 minutes of exposition following Commodus and Lucilla's introduction, Ridley Scott seems to tack things on whenever the script runs into weak spots. This leaves the film without a flowing narrative and it seems to want to please a mindless summer movie action market while at the same time aspiring to be something deeper. What it leaves us with is a schizophrenic, unequivocal story full of contradictions.There seems to be an epidemic in the past three or four years - films like this, Titanic, The Patriot, Pearl Harbor, Enemy at the Gates etc, try hard to be great epic films but at their core they are very slight and even trivial. The story in Gladiator holds promise but what little conflict there is set up and thrown at us in the first hour, leaving just a linear resolution to unfold for the remainder. A shame because so many elements could have been introduced in this story to make it truly an awesome and thoughtful epic. I guess complex stories like Spartacus and Ben-Hur will never be made again. This one falls somewhere short, though better than Demitrius and the Gladiators and the film it heavily borrows its narrative structure from - The fall of the Roman Empire.Technically the CGI is at times seamless and other times poor. When our troop of Gladiators run into the colosseum for the first time however the effect is absolutely jaw dropping and the scene that follows certainly delivers the action goods. The acting is very good throughout except for Tomas Arana as Quintus (about as bad as John Dall in Spartacus) and the aforementioned Richard Harris.Like Braveheart, not a bad entertainment experience but highly Hollywoodized and with an uneven narrative. But unlike Braveheart, the ending to Gladiator is a just a little embarrassing as it rips off both Braveheart and Titanic to far less effect. If you can get past the flaws, not the worst Roman spectacle on offer. Too highly rated at 8.1/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Didn't deserve the Oscar...Doesn't deserve Top 250.,"There's really nothing spectacular about ""Gladiator"". The acting is stiff because of the boring and sometimes non-sensible script. Ridley Scott's direction is choppy and forced. It reminded me more of one of his brother's movies. I love Russell Crowe but the fact that he won Best Actor for this and not for ""The Insider"" or ""A Beautiful Mind"" just doesn't make sense. To me he just seems bored in some scenes. I wonder if the Oscar voters watched any of the other films from that year because this sure wasn't better than ""Traffic"". Of the 2 and a half hours running time, there are really only 30-40 minutes of excitement. The rest is average at best and the ending is just ridiculous. THIS IS NOT A CLASSIC. ""Gladiator"" is a good film but does not deserve the praise that it is given by most on this site.

There are great films and then there is GLADIATOR,"It saddens me that a man such as Ridley Scott can work for months on location bringing the most perceptive and detailed vision of ancient Rome to absolute reality, only to incur the inappropriate, juvenile and one dimensional comments such that I have read here - the following few ""reviews"" (and I use the term 'loosely') especially. Comments such as ""horrible movie,""  ""no interesting characters,"" ""bad acting"" and my personal favorite, ""crappy special effects,"" is a sad epitaph to the lack of awareness and utter stupidity of so many viewers.GLADIATOR is one of the finest movies ever made, I don't ""think"" it, I am telling you! Ridley Scott pulled off a jaw-dropping miracle reeling the finished product in at just on $60 million. It has the appearance, continuity and professional veneer of a $300 million production. It is in fact only an adaptation on Samuel Bronston's classic 1964 movie THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, itself the most literate and well-acted epic of the 50's and 60's...and again, the key figure of Marcus Aurelius is handled with such dignity, feeling and intelligence. In 1964 Sir Alec Guinness played Aurelius as a strong and clear-thinking man of moral strength and fortitude. In GLADIATOR, Richard Harris hands in what I consider his best role ever, portraying Aurelius as a political visionary, caring parent and incorruptible leader. Excellent though Russell Crowe is here, it is Ridley Scott makes the film what it is, together with the cinematography and enervating musical score. Russell has actually not that great a dialog overload! In the acting department, Phoenix blows him off the screen as the immoral, aggrieved and ultimately weak emperor in waiting. Oliver Reed as Proximo? Well, how he did not win best supporting actor posthumously I will never know. This is the greatest Oscar scandal in history as far as I am concerned. It was the role of his life and he took it in both hands and wrung his life out into the part....completely it would seem. He died as he would have wished, tanked and slipping off a bar stool in Malta towards the end of filming. But he gave us an unforgettable Proximo and I will long honor his name with the memory of what he did here.Crappy special effects huh?  Well, in the film I saw - I was looking at the COLOSSEUM, not a special effect. I was there with them. I have never seen any CGI effect come close to what these techos achieved. Can you believe there were no more than 48 people ever on set? The ""crowds"" were made up of the same 48 people wearing different clothes and ""matted"" together - you want to tell me it ""looked"" like that? The arena action certainly was a far cry from the ""Chariot Race"" in BEN HUR but there again, what isn't? It was still exciting stuff though, well for the vaguely cerebral set I hasten to add.A film like GLADIATOR comes along probably once every 40 years or so. Its a pity so many didn't notice it THIS time around. Still, you are probably outnumbered three to one.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
One of my top 5 ever,This movie should be rated nothing less than 10. It really is an incredible movie. The music is one of the great attributes to this film.

There are a few that stand out this is one. Shawshank is one. Forrest Gump is one. I think Braveheart is a great movie. However between this and shawshank it's a toss up I think shawshank probably is still my favorite of all time.

Predictable Spectacle,"I never got around to seeing this in the theater. I'm sure it's a marvelous spectacle on the big screen. I don't know what it was. I found the acting good, the spectacle and special effects outstanding, the hero one we could cheer for. Why, then, do I feel so empty? Was it all the hype, best picture of the year? I just don't know. It was totally predictable. There were absolutely no surprises. After seeing The Patriot and realizing both movies have the same plot, I expected something more. Why are evil Roman Emperors always portrayed as cowardly wimps? I still don't believe that he actually was willing to go into the arena with Maximus. He wouldn't have anything to do with war. There is the obligatory killing of the family. That goes back to Macbeth folks. If a ruler wants to stay a ruler, leave the family alone. I know it's just to show how evil and powerful the Emperor is, but do you want the top general in the army gunning for you?--this will guarantee it. There is masterful cinematography in this film. The scenes of violence are masterful. Although once you've seen one fountain of blood spouting up, you've seen them all--one decapitation is like another. What I wanted was to see the characters really dealing with the evil of the times and confronting it. There is always that army out there ready to be commanded again. There is always the possibility that the greatest empire in the world can be destroyed by one guy (like when Mel Gibson won the Revolutionary War all by himself). I think this is really quite a good film. But I don't see it as deserving to be named the best of any year.

Great Story but Far From Historical,"Firstly, Romans never referred to the Colloseum as the ""Colloseum"".  It was called the Flavian Amphitheatre.Commodus was an actual emperor who ruled from A.D. 180 to 192.  He did indeed fight in the Colloseum against gladiators, and was quite good at it because he never lost (Maybe he cheated like in the movie).His sister, Lucilla, did conspire with his wife Crispina to have him killed. They were caught and banished to an island and later killed.His mistress Marcia tried to drug him to death but failed, so they had some athlete strangle him to death.  He died on New Year's Eve A.D. 192.He was a nut case, and was quite murderous, but that's about the only things real about the movie.Other than the historical problems, the story was great.

An Essential Revenge Movie!,"Both my Dad and my Brother say this movie's overrated, I don't. Gladiator is everything I could ever ask for and more. I find the most common complaint is that the story is too simple and basic, but there's nothing wrong with that. Sure it's always great to see movies subvert genre conventions, but if there was any movie that did the basic tale of revenge to such an epic level, it was Gladiator.The characters are iconic, supported by powerful performances. Crowe's Oscar for best actor is well deserved and I will always remember Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus, the action scenes are intense and spectacular, the visuals are astonishing and the music is breathtaking, creating an overall epic and emotional experience like no other.Not only is this my favourite Ridley Scott movie, but it's simply one of my favourite movies of all time.

"Ridley Scott's Ancient Revenge Fantasy is a Burner, Through and Through","A number of giant, career-making performances (plus another impressive turn in the director's chair for Ridley Scott) fuel this rich, hard-hitting saga of betrayal, grief and revenge in imperial Rome. The dueling fates of Maximus (Russell Crowe) and Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) share the front and center, twin note-perfect parts that continuously clash over the spotlight, but dozens of supporting players also deserve recognition. Richard Harris as the guilt-ridden sage, Marcus Aurelius. Oliver Reed chewing scenery as a grizzled, cynical combatant-turned-slaver. Djimon Hounsou and Ralf Moeller, comrades in arms who convey an intimate, crucial sense of kinship. As an intensely emotion-driven story, Gladiator can't function without this level of acting power. In less capable hands, it might be laughed off the screen. With Crowe, Phoenix and company in command - and, again, Scott there to expertly piece it all together amid an appropriately epic score by Hans Zimmer - we're swept off our feet.It's an enveloping film; a thick flood of sights, sounds and moods. We marvel over the bustling Roman Colosseum, tense our muscles in the raging chaos of battle, find peace in the metaphor of golden wheat fields as an afterlife. Maximus's justified outrage becomes our own, Commodus (with his barely-contained mania) our bane, and once it's got those hooks in, the script doesn't give an inch.

"Worst ""historical"" film ever","If you know ANYTHING about the history of Rome, please do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie.Lets see: Film opening sequence. General Maximus speaks such nonsense about troops, casualties etc. The massive battle in the movie would have been fine if they didn't have archers or catapults in the scene. After that, they should have used the scene in ""braveheart"", instead of a film about Romans.Remember that Roman army didn't charge into combat without controlled formations?Not considering this fact, the battle is the BEST part of the film. After this incident, the plot of the movie is sooooo predictable, as if the manuscript had been written by someone with the imagination of 12 year old child.Actors then...I have only seen worse acting performed by mr. Sylvester Stallone than the Aussie playing the role of Maximus. Even a wooden log could have put more feeling into the scene when he finds his family slaughtered. Besides, he rode a huge journey in one day, came to the smoking ruins of his villa from a distance of 1000 klicks (try that yourself).And the final scene: Emperor challenging a gladiator into a duel, how stupid is that?

Gladiator: A Story of Strength and Vengeance,"""Gladiator,"" starring Russell Crowe as the indomitable Maximus Decimus Meridius, is a breathtaking journey back to the grandeur and brutality of ancient Rome. Directed by Ridley Scott, this movie is a masterful blend of historical spectacle and deeply personal vengeance. After being betrayed and losing everything he holds dear, Maximus embarks on a path of retribution against those who wronged him, including the corrupt emperor Commodus, played with chilling effectiveness by Joaquin Phoenix.What makes ""Gladiator"" extraordinary is its ability to weave together the spectacle of gladiatorial combat with a moving story of loss, anger, and ultimately, redemption. Maximus's struggle is not just with his adversaries in the arena, but with his own grief and desire for vengeance. The film brilliantly captures the essence of the human spirit's resilience, the quest for justice, and the fight for honor in a world ruled by power and corruption.""Gladiator"" is more than an epic tale of the past; it's a timeless reminder of the power of the human will, the importance of loyalty, and the unyielding quest for justice. It appeals to anyone who has ever faced insurmountable odds and fought to reclaim their honor.

"Criminally Overrated; a Roman ""Death Wish""","As I write this, I see upon my shelf of movies a true classic everyone should know; ""The Raiders of the Lost Ark.""  It was the best Indiana Jones flick; escapism refined to its purest, most unadulterated form.  I wish I had been old enough when it was released in 1983 to call it a stirring epic and one of the best movies of all time.Was it those things?  Certainly not.  You know what you want to see in ""Raiders,"" and that's Harrison Ford escape from impossible situations, stirring action sequences, and Nazis getting their just desserts.  I know what I was looking for when I went to see ""Gladiator,"" and that was testosterone-oozing killing machines lopping off arms and limbs in a plot not too intellectually stimulating where the the bad guy died and our hero won out.  I saw that, and I give the movie a 6-7 as a result; professionally-done, cliche`d, brainless action and nothing more.  It, too, was cheap (100 million dollar-cheap) escapism, so why is it the forerunner for Best Picture?The Academy was duped when they saw this.  There's nothing Best Picture-worthy about this film.  Performances?  No.  Direction?  No. Script?  A thousand times no!Russell Crowe for Best Actor?  To his credit, he's suave and probably tough enough to grind Kirk Douglas from ""Spartacus"" into chum.  He gives one of the best performances I've ever seen from someone who maintains the EXACT SAME facial expression and emotional state throughout 9/10 of the movie's running time.  The real talent here was with Joaquin Phoenix, who transformed a character written as a whining infantile nuisance that wouldn't scare a goldfish into a truly creepy and threatening presense. He deserves a Best Supporting Actor nomination, but not for this.  He gave an even better performance in ""Quills.""Speaking of Philip Kaufman's masterpiece, ""Quills"" is one movie on a list I would have rather seen nominated for Best Picture of 2000 than ""Diehard with Sandals.""  ""Almost Famous,"" ""American Psycho,"" ""High Fidelity"" and ""You Can Count on Me"" are only a few of the well-crafted pieces of cinematic glory we received in 2000 that were overlooked by the members of the Academy that would rather get soaked in au jus and thrown into a tiger's cage than ::gasp!:: NOMINATE A MOVIE THAT MADE LESS THAN 50 MILLION DOLLARS (Miramax films excluded)!!!  I guess the actors in the preceding films should've used a monotone voice and screamed a few more times.What really irks me, though, is the nerve of the Academy nominating ""Gladiator's"" overcooked, cliche`s-on-parade laden script.  Holy Mother of Christ, movies like this aren't driven by a script.  They're driven by studio executives throwing fistfulls of money to make something that will make you go ""oooh"" and ""aaaah.""Movies are an art form, and with that, ""Gladiator"" is the equivalent of the sketch artist at the mall doing portraits for ten dollars each.  The Picasso of the nominees is the challenging, explosive ""Traffic,"" and the awe-inspiring ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (a movie with a hint of human connection and feeling; Ridley Scott, take note) is Salvador Dali.  I plea to any Academy Member that might by chance be reading this: please, I beg of you, leave this along with the mediocre ""Erin Brockovich"" and the preach-fest ""Chocolat"" at the bottom of the heap, and let a movie made by people who know and care take home the gold.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

A Gripping Tale of Heroism and Betrayal,"At the heart of the story is Maximus Decimus Meridius, a revered Roman general portrayed by Russell Crowe. Maximus embodies honor, loyalty, and a deep sense of justice.

The production design and cinematography capture the grandeur of the Colosseum and the opulence of the Roman Empire. Combined with Hans Zimmer's epic score, the visuals create a rich and immersive backdrop for the narrative.Russell Crowe delivers a commanding performance as Maximus, showcasing his strength, determination, and vulnerability.

Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Commodus is equally noteworthy, portraying a complex and morally corrupt character consumed by power.The action sequences in ""Gladiator"" are visceral and intense, showcasing the brutal nature of gladiatorial combat. The fight choreography is skillfully executed, immersing the audience in the heart-pounding battles that serve as a backdrop for Maximus' quest for vengeance.While ""Gladiator"" is primarily an action-oriented film, it also explores deeper themes of honor, loyalty, and the corrupting influence of power. The characters grapple with their own desires and moral dilemmas, creating a complex web of relationships and conflicts that drive the narrative forward.Ridley Scott's direction brings together all the elements of the film, weaving a tale of heroism and betrayal against the backdrop of ancient Rome.

Besides the large scale battle of the beginning and the spectacular gladiator fights, it's the emotional aspects that captivates the most in Scott's epic.

Commodus,"This right here? Undisputed King of the Modern Day Swords and Sandals genre. It just hits that perfect note of an epic without feeling contrived or over indulgent. Ridley Scott really did something masterful here because I think this film showed an exceptional deft touch in terms of balancing accuracy and legitimacy with the feel of the movie, that emotional resonance that can overwrite some nonsense.Crowe's understated, quiet performance is perfect for Maximus and Phoenix's portrayal of Commodus is just a reminder of how skilled that man is. It's a real Batman/Joker kind of vibe with the stoic hero and the crazy, sadist villain and Phoenix is able to put these layers in there that make Commodus feel so complex and deep. It's something we're missing from a lot of villains these days who are just ""I'm big and bad because... Because!"" Instead he manages to make this character both sniveling and pathetic but also terrifying!After all this praise, it's weird to say that I don't love this movie.

Made me want to visit Rome,"Gladiator has become an icon of the 21st century of cinema. The film tells the story of Maximus (Russell Crowe), a former Romanian general turned slave and then gladiator, sets on a journey to avenge the death of his wife and son. Betrayed by the conspiring emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), Maximus must endure the brutal nature of the Colosseum and will stop at nothing until he's received his revenge.You can judge this film by so many different aspects. Just by the year this was made and the set pieces they were aiming to bring to life, I think they did a good job. The battle sequence in the beginning of the film is filled with extras and little use of CGI which to me is incredible. To orchestrate a set piece like this has got to be very difficult and yet they were able to achieve an exhilarating scene that really shows you the capabilities of the Roman Empire.Something about this sequence that bothered me and unfortunately continues throughout other fighting scenes is the shaking camera. It happens more in closeups as a means to give more realism to the scene. What it ultimately does, at least for me, is turn the scene all blurry, not being able to comprehend what's going on and miss out on what otherwise is a gut wrenching duel.I don't think I need to expand on the acting. There is a reason Russell Crowe won an oscar for his performance and Jouaquin Phoenix was nominated. The rest of the cast brings out some of their best performances as well.As for the score and direction, Hans Zimmer brings to life the empire that was Rome. With a thrilling score that keeps your heart beating fast and shifts the emotion of the different plot points. I think this is one of Ridley Scott's best films. I saw a good chunk of his films and other than ""The Martian"" and ""The Last Duel"" (both terrific) Gladiator is honestly a work of art.This film has gore, grittiness, drama, suspense and action.

Not only does Ridley Scott make usually excellent actors bring forth lines that let ""The Phantom Menace"" ring like Shakespeare in my ears.

All in all, if it weren't for a few corrupt Senators and a megalomaniac young emperor, Rome seems to have had no flaws for Scott whatsoever. Ah, a little genocide here, some imperialism there...the others were all ""barbarians"" anyway.

Oscar for Best Picture? Come on!,"Poignant and evocative as this movie is, no way should it have been best picture. The story is too thin, the script lacks sufficient sophistication. Marcus Aurelius to Maximus'give Rome back to the people it belongs'. Way too vague and general a statement the like of which is repeated too often.Mind you this is a good film, powered by Crowe and the fabulous music of Lisa Gerrard and Hans Zimmer. Gerrard's voice in the dream sequences is fantastic. Crowe has great presence. His Maximus is tired of fighting even before the fighting begins at the beginning of the film. The look on his face at the beginning says it all - a man duty bound to his orders, yet tired and sad at the nature of his duty, yet confident in his own ability and that of his soldiers to carry them out. Crowe retains his tortured tough guy look right the way through.As impressive as the action sequences are at the beginning in the German forest and later in the colosseum, the film looks way too grainy. It's alright for the early sequences where the forest is supposed to be dark and gloomy anyway, but Rome should have been more light and clarity. Special effects and art direction in this sense are a let down.The supporting cast is not given much to work with by the weak script. Derek Jacobi has almost nothing to do, Joaquin Phoenix's villain is just way too one dimensional (not really the actor's fault). Connie Nielsen easily stands out as Maximus' ex-love.I think it's the powerful emotions aroused by the Gerrard-Zimmer music and Crowe's screen presence which propelled this to best picture status. The story and script are just too weak to merit it. Ridley Scott doesn't make bad films, but the visual weaknesses of the film in parts prevent him being praised too much for this effort. He has enough good films under his belt anyway.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

A summer blockbuster with a novel twist...,"Summer blockbusters are creatures of their own, aiming to cater to and exploit our lowest desires. Ridley perfectly understands this and consciously tries to redefine them when he gets a chance. Unlike many others, he knows what he is doing and approaches the matter with care instead of force. This works only because of him.We have a movie about a spectacle, in which we and the mob are one and the same. It's cynical as it bashes the industry and us, yet hopeful with its vision for the future. The visual style is novel and somewhat counterintuitive. Typically, one would expect huge cinematic battles, filled with bloodshed, as well as a very architecturally dimensional Rome, filled with pride of its history. Here, these are handed very differently, casually placed in the background. We imagine and deduce them from the eyes of the characters - very subtle, especially for a summer blockbuster.

An epic for all generations,"This movie is one of those that you can watch N-number of times and will still feel that you're watching it for the first time. The same thing happened to me when I recently watched this modern classic in theatre since it has got re-released before the arrival of its sequel. I literally wept during the ending which I've seen countless times. That's the kind of effect this Ridley Scott's finest work till now has.Starring Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, Derek Jacobi, Djimon Hounsou and Richard Harris, this Historical epic was bound to be a major hit. Not only the cast, the background score given by none other than Hans Zimmer himself is so great that it will stay in your head forever. Especially ""Now We Are Free"" track by Lisa Gerrard is one of the best original track that one can get in a movie.Crowe's portrayal of Maximus, a Roman general turned Gladiator to avenge the killing of his wife and son is so real and compelling that it makes you ache for his justice.

Great acting and story but quite dated and formulaic otherwise.,"I think without a doubt that Gladiator's strengths are its simple but powerful story and its engaging performances. Other than that, however, I think the overall style of the film and the film-making itself are already quite badly dated and forgettable. It doesn't feel like the personal vision of a talented filmmaker (Ridley Scott in this case) but more like an anonymous miniseries with great actors and a very big budget. So, it's good but it should have been great and I find it frustrating because I think it's overrated and I don't know why so many people either can't see or just don't mind what appear to me to be obvious flaws.The action scenes are no longer very special. Braveheart had passionate battle scenes with very precise and skillful choreography. It's not that these ones aren't skillful, but they aren't very original and there's nothing particularly personal about them either. And of course, the special effects are well past their ""best before"" date so that aspect no longer helps a whole lot.Is Hans Zimmer a hack? He blatantly rips off Holst's ""Mars: The Bringer of War"" (and does it badly), not to mention tinges of Vangelis, but maybe Scott is in part to blame for this. His orchestral texture is typical of his scores, there's the obligatory march (that sounds a lot like Pirates of the Caribbean, which he had a hand in, not to mention the Michael Bay movies he's done) and worst of all he employs the subtlety of a sledge hammer when it comes to setting the mood in rousing or emotional scenes. One major exception to this in my opinion was Richard Harris' last scene which I found surprisingly good, as if the director gave him some freedom and he actually liked the scene. Otherwise, Zimmer's music fits the movie, or at least its obvious surface layer, perfectly. No risks. No depth. Plenty of formula.Russel Crowe's performance transcends the dated film-making. It's honest and gritty. Oliver Reed also stood out for me (especially his eyes) while the rest are more than engaging. Coupled with the effective story, the performances make the movie worth seeing (IMHO).So, weakness = formulaic film-making. Strength = story + acting. I reckon if you replaced Hans Zimmer's score with any thematically similar music and re-filmed all the non-dialogue scenes using any competent but disinterested cinematographer, Gladiator would be just as popular as it currently is.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"A real inspiring,beautiful and magical film","I first watched the film 'Gladiator' last year at home with my parents. Foolishly I didnt go to the movies to watch it, but my parents rented it out and as they had already seen and thought it was a 'must see' , me and my younger brother trusted their judgement. All i can say is 'WOW'. The film opens with that beautiful eastern-sounding music (Lisa Gerrerd) and from that moment I knew that this film was going to be unlike anything id seen before.The actual story is so wonderful and the director (Ridley Scott) and talented actors (Russell Crowe to name but one) make this film magical and definatly one that you won't forget in a hurry. I remember thinking to myself during the film 'Oh my god! this film is fantastic'. The ending is a guaranteed tear jerker, and i felt that lump in the back of my throat and knew that in a couple of seconds id feel my eyes filling up! Ive since bought the Film on video (watching it whenever i can!)I think I know each characters complete script!! I also purchased both the Gladiator soundtracks because me and my dad fell in love with the music! I love the way that Lisa Gerrard and Hans Zimmer worked together so effectivly,they are definatly names we'll be hearing more of in the future! I enjoy all the tracks, as they all remind me of the movie, and I have listened and watched so many times that I know just from the music , which part of the film im at, and if i watched the film and turned down the volume i bet i could even tell you what music was playing! All i can leave you with is one comment 'Experiance Gladiator' You'll come away smiling,humming the music and Madly in love with the man you know you cannot have 'Russell Crowe'! A tip from me, There are certain situations where playing the soundtracks has been wonderful! 1) On the way to work..turn up the volume of those battle scenes and you'll soon be riding in a chariot rather that your Ford Focus! 2) In the bath, the slow romantic tunes are so magical! and finally 3) Listen to Elysium,Honor Him and Now we are free anywhere anytime and you'll instantly be taken back to ancient rome and that magnificant collisium!Love Caley, 17, southampton england",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

consistently indescribably superb,"Their are no words to describe this grand historic epic. Gladiator is a film everybody would enjoy, for it has a great story, great action and superb acting (no wonder Crowe got an Oscar!) Gladiator recounts the story of one of the greatest Roman generals Maximus, who was forced to slavery by the corrupt incestuous heir to the throne Commodus (Phoenix) who killed Marcus Aurelius the emperor for he knew he offered Maximus power over his own son. Maximus has then become his worst enemy. Commodus having ordered to kill him and his family, Maximus escapes death and as becomes the general who became a slave, the slave who became gladiator, and the gladiator who defied an emperor. Gladiator has some of the most beautiful scenery and CGI effects I have ever seen. IT really is one of the best ""recent"" films out there. The script is also very effective and suiting, and somehow adds a poetic feel to it and so does the superb music used.

After that the movie starts slowly and keeps going faster till the end. Thats another reason why it is good.

One of the best,"There's no such thing as a perfect movie and i don't think that Gladiator is even near that. But this movie takes a could be basic 80's style action film (like mad max or any steven segal movie)and turns it into a cinematic masterpiece. Ridley Scott is known to make C class concepts into A style movies (Blade Runner) and knows what he's doing and how. the Cinematography is perfect and this is a film for almost everyone to enjoy. If you like rich dialog and cinematography, then this is your film. If you like action and intense war scene, then this is your film. Joaquin Phoenix steals ever scene he is in as he plays the Empire son, who becomes Empire himself. Russell Crowe as much as everyone hate always gives his greatest performance ever (even though he is very good in L.A. confidential). Oliver Reed (Goodfellas) also gives a humorous but heartfelt performance as Maximus' owner who was once a Gladiator himself, this would also mark the last Oliver Reed film unfortunately as he died after filming. Dijmon Hounsou (Amastad, In America) also did a good job as well, surprised me for the most as he was only a model prior to this. But this movie overall isn't the best i have seen, but it should be recognized as one of the best.

"An excellent, albeit historically inaccurate, film.","A rousing story of one man surviving adversity and destroying a corrupt man in the process, Gladiator is a very entertaining 2 1/2 hour ride. The best part of the movie is the backdrop itself, for which Ridley Scott aggressively takes the moviegoer on a trip throughout all corners of the Roman Empire, and even to their concept of heaven in the process. Definitely worth the money, and I'm sorry that I didn't get to see it on the big screen.I was disturbed, however, by the historical liberties taken with the script. For those of you who don't care about this sort of thing, please stop reading now.OK, first of all, Marcus Aurelius died of the plague, which would have been pretty hard for Commodious to fake if he had killed his father. 2nd, Commodius lived for 12 years (180-192 A.D.) so his quick rise and fall doesn't really jibe historically either (he died in a wrestling match). Also, he was known for his physical strength, so his wimpiness in the movie really didn't make sense.These items, taken alone, bother me a little, but then there are more disturbing factors to take into account. For one, soldiers weren't allowed BY LAW to get married, so all of Maximus' talk of ""going home to see his wife"" really doesn't make sense. Soldiers did keep women on nearby plots of land, but they probably wouldn't talk openly about it. Also, Rome was in a defensive posture; most of the lands they had acquired they acquired BEFORE Marcus Aurelius came to power.I think what bothers me the most is the fact that Marcus Aurelius was no hero. He was renowned for persecuting Christians; he stepped up efforts during his regime, believing that Christianity would be the death of the empire. While he did do some very good things for the empire, he wasn't the benevolent patriarch that the movie made him out to be. He also tried to marry his nephew to his daughter so they would produce a ""super emperor""; my guess is that he probably didn't want Rome to be a Republic again.Revisionist history is troublesome. Although this did happen nearly 2 millennia ago, we still can't forget that the emperors of the day were not heroes by today's standards. I'm not one of those politically correct people who thinks that movies about despots shouldn't be made. I simply believe that historical figures should be presented honestly for what they did (and didn't do), and not sugarcoated for a mass audience.Having said all that, I really did like the movie. I give it an 8/10, with the disclaimer that it's no Braveheart, but it is visually stunning and hard to look away from while you're watching it, but not a movie that really will affect me for months after seeing it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Thank you Ridley Scott.,"Gladiator is a truly great depiction of an important part of early Roman Empire. Yes, Gladiator will probably win the Oscar of Best Picture of 2000, but should it?  While I agree that watching it was a great pleasure, I am not convinced that it was the best movie made last year.  In any other year, not containing a film named ¬ëCast Away', Gladiator would get my absolute vote, however in the interest of keeping this review to the movie at hand, I will not name which one I feel should win.Viewing Gladiator was definitely a spectacle everyone should endure. It has everything any good movie should; an original story, great acting, and truly awe-inspiring direction.  To be transported to a world that existed over 1800 years ago, and experience the very same excitement the Romans were able to enjoy is just incredible.Ridley Scott struck did very well with his direction of Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Neilsen, and Oliver Reed (who unfortunately suffered a fatal heart attack during filming).  Scotts' ability to `see' the action in his head, and create the effect for the cameras is wonderful.  This is a far different epic than ¬ëAlien', and far better than ¬ëHannibal'.Russell Crowe is fabulous as Maximus Meridius, the great soldier planning to return to his home after fighting his last battle only to find himself thrust between the dead kings will for him to become the new king, and Commudus, the son of the former king wanting him to stay and fight for him. Crowe is perfect in this role, he is strong, rugged looking, and has become quite a good actor since his days in ¬ëThe Quick and the Dead' and the awful ¬ëVirtuosity'.Joaquin Phoenix is magnificent in his role as Commudus.   Only recently have I noticed what great acting skills Phoenix possesses, and how well he transforms into such diverse characters, such the same can be said of Ewan McGregor and his diverse roles in ¬ëTrainspotting', ¬ëLittle Voice' and ¬ëStar Wars: Episode I'.  Phoenix's ability to present himself in such a devious and hateful aspect is awe-inspiring.As the sister of Commudus, Lucilla (Connie Neilsen) has to play both devoted to her brother, and sympathetic to Maximus.  Neilsen pulls this off beautifully and she is very convincing in her role.The story is beautifully written, and there is never a dull moment.  After I viewed the film for the first time I felt that the gladiator fight scenes were too far apart, and not enough of them were in the movie.  However, a very good friend of mine, we shall call him Michael DeZubiria (check out his reviews), felt it necessary to explain to me that Gladiator is not just a story about fighting, but a story about the life struggles of one man and his quest to avenge the brutal killing of his family.Now, while I admit that I liked this film, I am not ready, nor will I ever be ready, to call it the best movie of 2000 (see my Cast Away review).  I do not want to take anything away from Gladiator, it's just that there was a more original, creative film in 2000.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"""A Ferocious Tale of Honor and Revenge""","In the grand arena of epic cinema, few films stand as tall and commanding as ""Gladiator."" Directed by Ridley Scott, this 2000 masterpiece isn't just a film; it's a visceral experience that immerses you in the brutality, glory, and treachery of ancient Rome. With its powerful storytelling and breathtaking visuals, ""Gladiator"" carves its name into cinematic history with the same ferocity as its protagonist.Russell Crowe delivers a career-defining performance as Maximus Decimus Meridius, a once-noble general betrayed and reduced to a mere slave. Crowe captures the essence of a warrior-a man of integrity and honor forced to navigate a landscape of betrayal and moral decay. From the very first scene, where we see him lead his troops to victory against Germanic tribes, we are drawn into his world: a world where valor is crucified and loyalty is a fleeting memory.The film pulls no punches in depicting the brutal reality of gladiatorial combat. The training montages and fierce arena battles are rendered with a staggering intensity that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The choreography is nothing short of breathtaking, each clash of swords resonating with the audience, a visceral reminder of the life-and-death stakes at play. When Maximus steps into the arena, it's not just a fight for survival; it's a fight for redemption, a chance to honor his fallen family and reclaim his stolen legacy.Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of the cruel Emperor Commodus adds an electrifying and sinister dynamic to the narrative. His transformation from an entitled brat to a ruthless tyrant is chilling; you can almost feel the cold sweat of ambition radiating off him. The rivalry between Commodus and Maximus is steeped in tension, showcasing a battle not just of swords, but of wills. The power struggle is palpable, amplifying the stakes of Maximus's quest for justice and revenge.The cinematography is nothing short of stunning, with sweeping epic landscapes and meticulously crafted sets that depict both the grandeur and the grotesque nature of the Roman Empire. Hans Zimmer's stirring score elevates the emotional weight of the film, guiding us through Maximus's journey from beloved general to feared gladiator. Each note echoes the themes of loss, valor, and the quest for freedom.At its core, ""Gladiator"" is not just about the spectacle of combat; it's a poignant exploration of what it means to be a man of honor in a world of chaos. Themes of loyalty, sacrifice, and the pursuit of justice are expertly woven into the narrative, making Maximus's journey not only a fight for survival but a quest that resonates deeply with our own struggles against adversity.""Gladiator"" is a timeless epic that redefined the historical drama genre. It's a relentless, powerful film that combines heart-pounding action with profound emotional storytelling. Watching Maximus rise from the ashes of betrayal to reclaim his honor is a cinematic journey that will leave you breathless, reminding you that in the face of oppression, true strength is forged in the fires of resilience. Prepare for a wild ride through history that's equal parts blood, sweat, and glory.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Ridley Scott's artificial epic isn't very impressive,"Ridley Scott's Oscar-winning ersatz epic is one of the least spectacular big-screen spectacles ever sold to an undemanding public: a sand-and-sandal throwback stripped of the genre's all too necessary guilty pleasures. The idea was to recreate for today's digital generation a wide-screen Roman Empire costume drama from Hollywood's pre-video adolescence, but all the fancy computer imagery (and state-of-the-art budget) only makes the new film look and sound more solemn and pompous than its beefcake role models. Worse yet, the occasional token nod toward old-fashioned visual grandeur isn't enough to camouflage the claustrophobic TV screen compositions and typically frantic Madison Avenue editing job (designed, perhaps, to hide the digital wrinkles).Russell Crowe is the title character: a Roman general fallen from imperial favor, battling for his life and honor on the floor of the Coliseum, where the prize for victory is another day of slavery and the cost of defeat is a mercifully quick death. Crowe's protagonist is a man of few words, most of them delivered in a flat monotone, matching the equally colorless photography, shaded in picturesque hues of misty gray and mud brown sepia.Don't expect any surprises from the strictly formula riches-to-rags-to-rebel hero scenario, which doesn't even allow the villains (degenerate emperor Joaquin Phoenix and his sister/lover Connie Nielson) a chance to have any fun. Audiences (and too many critics, who should have known better) conditioned by habit to reject anything original made the film a worldwide hit, but even in our current age of diminished expectations it should have been clear that they don't make 'em like they used to anymore.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Film as Colosseum,"Regular readers of my comments note my penchant for pointing out that film is a modern medium, meaning that films -- good ones anyway -- are often largely about themselves. When the nature of this self-comment is interesting, I point it out. But I failed to do so in an earlier comment on Gladiator, so here is the remedy.Summer movies target the lowest of our sensibilities. The plots are highly simplified morality plays where good and evil are radically drawn; the form is of violent spectacle. In other words, our civilized society wants the same things we observe in later Rome, to which we insist on feeling superior.So the master Scott gives us a violent spectacle about a violent spectacle. He makes fun of us by pandering to our baser tastes while slyly getting us to agree with the wise senator who observes how simple, stupid and manipulable is the mob. He did much the same in Blade Runner, but there the comment was on the sharpness, complexity of the audience not its dullness.Is this a maturing cynicism, an adventure into a new challenge (mastering the art of painting with a blunt palette), or a striking out against Hollywood's financial politics? I suppose we've have to wait a decade to find out -- until after the power-hungry Caesars die and the medium is returned to the enlightened leaders of the people.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Epic but Uneven,"Gladiator is a grand cinematic experience that delivers a powerful mix of drama and action. Ridley Scott's direction, combined with a sweeping score by Hans Zimmer, creates an immersive portrayal of ancient Rome. The film's production design is exceptional, capturing the grandeur of the Coliseum and the opulence of Roman architecture. The battle scenes are particularly impressive, showcasing intense choreography and high-stakes combat that make them truly memorable.Russell Crowe gives a commanding performance as Maximus, embodying both the strength and vulnerability of his character. Joaquin Phoenix also stands out as Commodus, offering a chilling and nuanced performance that adds depth to the film's antagonist.However, despite its many strengths, Gladiator isn't without its flaws. The narrative, while engaging, can feel a bit formulaic at times, with its revenge-driven plot following a somewhat predictable path. Some of the supporting characters, though well-acted, are underdeveloped and don't add much to the story beyond their immediate roles. Additionally, the pacing occasionally lags, particularly in the quieter, more introspective moments.Overall, Gladiator is a visually stunning and emotionally powerful film with standout performances and impressive action sequences.

"over-blown, over-violent and historically outrageous","I went to see Gladiator with low expectations, going only because I have a 1-2 movie a week habit, and there have been few good movies opening in American theaters in recent weeks.  What follows, therefore, is an opinion about one hollywood summer blockbuster movie from someone who admittedly doesn't like such movies in the first place.First of all, Gladiator has the generic faults of most such movies: 1) sophisticated and expensive production design, editing and special effects contrasted with a simple-minded story, stilted dialogue and characters with incomprehensible or unbelievable motivation; and 2) excessive length.  (To be fair, it does not have the very common third flaw, excessive noise.) There are many decent low-budget movies that get by with thin plots and bad dialogue, when directed quickly with some flair; but adding money, big-name (and talented) actors and length makes things worse, not better.I find the violence in Gladiator's battle and fighting sequences very distasteful.  I had the same feeling about Braveheart, although that movie at least balanced its violence with scenes of levity.  I do not object to cartoon violence in movies, and I have never been bothered by anything I saw in John Woo's or other Hong Kong movies.  Graphic scenes of realistic violence do upset me, even more so when (as in this movie or in Braveheart) it is ""righteous"" violence meted out by the hero.Finally, I was disgusted by the movie's misinterpretations of history.  The Roman Senate was an instrument of aristocracy, not democracy.  Commodus was killed by disgruntled servants, and no one thought of replacing him with anything but another emperor.  Having him decide to fight a skilled gladiator is the supreme example of lame screenwriting in this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Many of his critics who feel that he shouldn't have won an Oscar for his performance are taking it one step further and saying that he was downright dull.  I don't know if Crowe deserved the Best Actor Oscar, but I do know that dull he was anything but. He is the only one I know who could have played Maximus and given him any depth and at the same time be convincingly intimidating.  Kudos to the arguably best actor in showbiz!Joaquin Phoenix's work as Commodus was severely underrated.  It didn't take but one minute before I hated Commodus with a deep hatred.  His scenes with Lucilla (Connie Nelson) are just plain eerie, causing me to hate him more.This is easily Ridley Scott's best job as a director.  He gives ""Gladiator"" an elegance and a darkness that together make the movie quite unique.This is my all-time favorite movie and I think anyone who doesn't go see it is losing out!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"USE YOUR MIND, NOT YOUR GLANDS: WATCH ""I, CLAUDIUS"" INSTEAD!","The biggest single indictment of this disatrous excuse for an epic is that the one truly great actor in the movie, Derek Jacobi, is (like Richard Harris and Oliver Reed) brought in to bring a whiff of authentic class (to hide the other whiffs), and, like the others, is quickly snuffed.  Jacobi, of course, was the absolutely brilliant star of the probably the greatest Roman epic ever, I, CLAUDIUS.  That scintillating 13-hour classic doesn't have a single boring or predictable moment (unlike this mess) and is all characterization and plotting, not spectacle, the exact opposite of this movie, which uses character stereotypes and a ludicrous storyline that wouldn't pass the cartoon test.  Half the acting is Russell Crowe swearing revenge and grimacing as he flexes his pectorals.  Even the spectacle here is MUDDY and BLOODY.  If you want to be like the Romans and enjoy the sight of people being disemboweled and torn limb from limb, then by all means check this out.

A Roaring 9/10,"Gladiator is an epic masterpiece that easily earns a 9 out of 10. Directed by Ridley Scott and starring Russell Crowe as Maximus Decimus Meridius, this film combines intense action, powerful performances, and a compelling story to create an unforgettable cinematic experience.Russell Crowe delivers a career-defining performance as Maximus, a betrayed Roman general who seeks vengeance against the corrupt emperor Commodus, played with chilling precision by Joaquin Phoenix. Crowe's portrayal is both fierce and nuanced, capturing the heart of a warrior and the pain of a grieving family man. Phoenix's Commodus is a perfect foil-cruel, insecure, and disturbingly complex.The film's visuals are stunning. From the grandiose Colosseum battles to the intimate, dusty streets of ancient Rome, Ridley Scott's direction brings historical authenticity and epic grandeur. The battle scenes are meticulously choreographed and shot with a raw, visceral energy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Hans Zimmer's iconic score deserves special mention. The music swells with emotion, perfectly complementing the film's highs and lows, and enhancing every moment with its haunting melodies and powerful themes.Gladiator's narrative is tight and engaging, weaving themes of honor, betrayal, and revenge into a rich tapestry. The script deftly balances personal drama with epic spectacle, creating a story that is both deeply human and grandly mythic.However, the film isn't without minor flaws. Some historical inaccuracies and a few pacing issues in the middle act prevent it from achieving absolute perfection. But these are small blemishes on an otherwise spectacular film.Gladiator stands as a timeless classic, a film that combines stellar performances, breathtaking visuals, and a gripping story. It's a cinematic triumph that resonates long after the credits roll, solidifying its place as one of the greatest films in the epic genre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Tragedy of symbolism over storytelling,"The expectations of this film are enormous,, given the hype and popularity surrounding it since release. The acclamation accorded it is , no doubt, explained in part by cinema audiences having been starved of Roman epics for so long. The same phenomena influenced the hype of many early 90s westerns, few of which merited serious attention (Tombstone and Unforgiven)Anyway, to return to Gladiator the viewer must always be wondering where is the plot, the story?. This is not a movie for the impatient, however, neither is it a movie for a patient viewer seeking true immersion in the story. The story is simply too ponderous. I always felt that I was watching a film and perhaps this is the worst crime any film can commit; the failure to let the viewer escape into its world and pretend for a period that this (the story)is actually happening - now and that he/she is a privileged witness to the events.None of the actors provide their characters with more than one dimension. Russell Crowe looks superb in the stills but in motion he  delivers no more variety of emotion than Dirty Harry (or worse Chuck Bronson in the Death Wish series!) Oliver Reed provides the few positive moments of feeling and passion.Mr Phoenix has 2 superb scenes as he murders his father and later when he threatens his nephew's life. Both are powerful, although the former is derived from Bladerunner - when Roy Batty crushes the skull of Tyrell.In the end we have a film which tries hard; delivering top stars; strong cinematography; an action charged setting but ultimately lets itself down by spinning a boring yarn. For a more entertaining version of similar events see The fall of the Roman Empire (1964).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"I am entertained, but I still think it's overrated","I may have been too harsh on Gladiator. I think because it arrived shortly after Braveheart, and it won Best Picture, I was more critical of it. This is a good movie. However, I still don't think it's as amazing as many people think it is. They struggled writing the script, which I think shows on the screen. The acting is also uneven, with some great moments and some weaker ones. However, the score is absolutely fantastic, and the visual effects are top-notch. I enjoyed watching it more this time around, but I still think that Cast Away should have won Best Picture of 2000 instead of Gladiator.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
What do you expect?,"Gladiator is one of those movies that  tries to present a splendid old story with today standards of film making so younger persons of our time could be impressed by that too. well, what do you expect? Gladiator tries to be(or imitate) something like Ben Hur and Spartacus but fails in many ways. I agree that the visual effects are amazing, but the score is not a masterpiece and the most important thing-in my idea-the screenplay is too ordinary and has nothing particular and new to present. It seems that the real point of killing Maximus is to make audiences cry.( I couldn't find any other reason to get him killed). But, in some ways the movie is worth watching.

Some may find parts of it to be a little cheesy, or some of the side characters to just be meh, those flaws are greatly overshadowed by the leads.Crowe is fantastic of course, but Joaquin Phoenix steals the film with an incredible performance as Commodus. From his first scene, to the last, you build an intense hate for his character.

Another big budget variation on a well-worn theme,"Gladiator is well-made and sports all the frills of a big budget production -- big sets and lotsa extras in good costumery.  However, let's be blunt, it is a 10-minute plot stretched out to epic proportions.  And, it is not a new plot.  It is not much more than a combination of Braveheart and Last of the Mohicans, go to Rome -- to name a couple of more recent films. In effect, it is hero gets done wrong and his loved ones are killed, so he bides his time and gets his revenge. I think all of the hurrah behind this film is from Hollywood having little else to offer this year at the Oscars (how else could Chocolat get nominated --$$$). Since Crouching Tiger is not part of the good ole boy Hollywood network, Hollywood is working hard to prevent a foreign film from upstaging them. In a different year, this film would not get half the recognition it is getting.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"Top 250?  Not even top 1000, sorry","How has Ridley Scott pulled the veil over everyone's eyes?  The camera-work in the first battle scene is disorienting and intentionally blurry to avoid showing anything in detail.  The dialogue, from start to finish, is unrealistic- both on a human level and a Roman level.  If you want to incorporate historical figures into a fictionalized account, treat them as historical figures, not perversions of historical figures with the same names.  Marcus Aurelius was not a 2000 year-too-early Thomas Jefferson. Whatever Hellenistic notions of democracy the Greeks held to, the Romans repudiated until the disintegration of their empire.  I laughed awkwardly (to mask my offense and disbelief) when Aurelius lets his daughter know what an impressive ""Caesar she would have made had she been born a man.""  What utter nonsense!  Furthermore, the character of Commodus is not so much miscast as it is botched in the person of Joaquin Phoenix.  Russell Crowe acquits himself nicely in his performance as Maximus, but is his story of revenge really that sympathetic?    The computer generated Rome is impressive, but not even on a par with the Rome of Julie Taymor's recent ""Titus.""  And what is this odd, recurring cornball shot of Maximus parallel to the ground as the grass moves under him?  The production value of Gladiator is high (at times), but someone should've hired a proofreader and BS detector.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
One of the best BC era films,"This film is probably one of the closest representations of the era its based on we will ever get to see. One of Crowe's most memorable performances, if not his best.

An Epic of Our Time,"In an age where CGI often overshadows storytelling, Ridley Scott's Gladiator (2000) is a breath of fresh cinematic air. This historical epic, set in a tumultuous era of the Roman Empire, is a masterclass in filmmaking, showcasing an amalgamation of riveting performances, stunning visuals, and a score that stirs the soul.At the heart of Gladiator is Maximus Decimus Meridius, played with steely determination and compelling vulnerability by Russell Crowe. Crowe's performance is a spectacular tour de force, embodying a man whose honor, family, and freedom are taken from him. The depth of his character arc - from respected Roman general to enslaved gladiator, from broken man to symbol of hope - is beautifully depicted, earning Crowe a well-deserved Oscar.Opposite Crowe is Joaquin Phoenix as the power-hungry, emotionally unstable Emperor Commodus. Phoenix masterfully portrays a character that we love to hate, providing a worthy adversary for Crowe's Maximus. The scenes between the two are electric, the tension palpable.Visually, Gladiator is a spectacle to behold. The depiction of ancient Rome, from its grand coliseums to its war-torn battlefields, is rendered with incredible detail and authenticity. The gladiatorial combats are raw and thrilling, capturing the brutality and excitement of the Roman games. Scott doesn't shy away from the violence, but rather uses it to underline the brutality of the era and the courage of those who dared to defy it.Yet, it is the film's memorable score by Hans Zimmer that elevates Gladiator to an exceptional cinematic experience. From the melancholic ""Now We Are Free"" to the stirring ""Battle,"" Zimmer's soundtrack resonates, amplifying the emotion and gravitas of the narrative.The screenplay, too, deserves praise. Packed with memorable lines - ""What we do in life echoes in eternity,"" - it's a script that complements the grandeur of the film's visuals and performances.Gladiator is more than a movie; it's an experience. A return to the golden age of epic filmmaking, it provides an emotional depth often lacking in blockbuster fare. It's a tale of vengeance and redemption, of the struggle against tyranny, and of the resilience of the human spirit. Two decades on, its impact remains undiminished, solidifying its position as one of the most compelling films of the 21st century.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"""I am Spartacus-I mean-Maximus!""","And Ridley Scott ain't Stanley Kubrick! Scott's sort-of remake of the modestly brilliant and richly emotional Spartacus and the horrendously bad Fall of the Roman Empire is a visually breathtaking epic that has almost no soul. I can't think of a reason to watch this movie other than to be entertained by three hours of close up violence, dazzling computer graphics, Russell Crowe's manliness, Connie Nielsen's loveliness, and Joaquim Phoenix's pree-versions.Done with the movie? You've got nothing to show for it.I don't worry too much about the myriad historical inaccuracies, such as the Roman Republic being reestablished at the end of Gladiator or Marcus Aurelius being murdered (if you have a clue about Roman history, you've just got to grin and bear it), but it's the reliance on the razzle-dazzle of the computer over the emotional depth of the characters that wears Gladiator down and leaves it bleeding in the center of the arena.The opening battle in Germany is eye-popping (and stomach-turning) in its recreation of a fight between Crowe's legion and a pack of Teutonic mouth-breathers. You're supposed to be impressed and hooked, but then the internecine backstabbing, betraying, and incestuous hanky-pankying start and you're left waiting for the next trip into some North African arena where you can watch people get disemboweled in the same grainy fashion as in Saving Private Ryan.It's all very appealing at a lizard-at-the-bottom-of-the-brain pan level (When I saw Gladiator in a theater in Ontario, Oregon, I heard a kid complaining, ""When are we gonna see her (Nielsen) naked?""). Front-load the gore and the kink, dazzle the viewer with recreations of the Roman world, and you don't need to get past Russell Crowe's growling and Phoenix's fussy sickness.Gladiator is emotionally empty. Stick with Kubrick's slave revolt.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Good Hollywood Epic,"It strikes me from the readers comments of the IMDB that as many people dislike GLADIATOR as like it. True it`s the sort of story we`ve seen before in several genres where good defeats evil but what`s wrong with that ? It`s well acted with Joaquin Phoenix playing the role of villain the right side of camp , well supported by a bunch of British thespians - Notice how many of the bad guys are played by Americans and good guys by Brits . Don`t see that too often - and Ridley Scott pulls out all the stops to make GLADIATOR a technical triumph , a shame he didn`t win the Oscar for best director , he`ll be hard pushed to make a film as good as this again. And accolades to John Mathieson and Hans Zimmer for photography and music respectively.GLADIATOR is one of three old fashioned Hollywood epics to have won the Oscar for best picture in recent years . After seeing the overrated BRAVEHEART and the truly awful TITANIC and comparing them with true epics like GONE WITH THE WIND , BEN HUR and LAWRENCE OF ARABIA I thought to myself "" Alas they don`t make them like they used to "". Then GLADIATOR came along and proved me wrong.As a footnote the DVD release to this film is excellent.

"Majestic production that won 2000s-audience; Fabulous Roman epic that echoes in film history as ""masterpiece""","They were just shadows and dust. Yet, their courageous deeds have been admired for hundreds of years. Their name was ... gladiators.Since 1959 and the release of the ultra popular Roman epic BEN HUR, many people have thought that William Wyler's movie reached the ultimate splendor on screen and no other production may take its stead. However, the memorable year 2000 sees a premiere of GLADIATOR by Ridley Scott. The movie's title does not indicate any novel nor any specific period of Roman history. Yet, the film becomes one of the top Hollywood productions. What is so extraordinary about it that GLADIATOR is admired not only by epic fans but by the audiences of different interests, different preferences, different expectations from a movie.First of all, GLADIATOR, unlike many other epics, shows a very realistic image of the Roman Empire and makes a perfect use of this on screen. In this case, the movie which discusses a very distant period in time (2nd century A.D.) occurs to be clearly interpreted and understood by the 21 century-audience. This fact proves a great talent of the director, Ridley Scott, who exactly knows viewers' expectations. Such a movie is more a spectacle and entertainment than pure history. Therefore, even if there are historic figures in the film, we cannot treat it as history and look for historical accuracy or inaccuracy. It is much more since it generally shows Rome, its power, its emperors, its people, its games, finally...its gladiators.It seems quite unnecessary to present the content of the film while hundreds have done this before me. What I want to concentrate on GLADIATOR's universal aspect, which makes it an exceptional epic. As a matter of fact, no one will fully understand the story of Maximus (Russell Crowe) without profound reflections. Simply, the entire content of GLADIATOR is one great symbol. A simple man, a farmer becomes a great leader, emperor's friend. Yet, when times change, he gets through a personal tragedy becoming a slave, a gladiator whose primary task is to amuse people and the corrupted emperor by killing. Nevertheless, it is him who is honored at his death - He was the one who loved Rome. In my opinion, the very first shot of the movie shows it all - where Maximus heart is - a bird symbolizing gentleness, and fields symbolizing his life. The final fight on arena between emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) and Maximus cannot be treated historically. It is a symbolic battle between two visions of Rome (using modern language - between two visions of the world) - the one of honor, equality and love and the one of decadence, slavery and corruption. And this is, I think, the most important message of this movie. In this perspective, the movie develops all characters universally.CAST: Russell Crowe, who portrays Maximus, does a very fine job. He portrays a man of a good heart who is exposed to living in the reality that is against all he heads for, a leader who got a new name, ""gladiator"". I loved his performance in one scene more than in any other - in the conversation with the emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). Wonderful meeting of two seeing one goal - goodness of Rome! Joaquin Phoenix is also very memorable as brute Commodus, a corrupted emperor who is, on the one hand, a blood sucker, but, on the other hand, a man who wants to be loved. I also loved the performance of Connie Nielsen as Lucilla. This beautiful Danish actress very well fits to this role portraying a woman who lives in the very ambiguous reality. A note must also be made of Derek Jacobi, unforgettable Claudius from a perfect BBC series made almost 30 years earlier. Yet, two performances by already late actors are a must to mention, Richard Harris's phenomenal portrayal of Marcus Aurelius and Oliver Reed's slave trader Proximo. Oliver Reed died during filming and his death is a terrible loss to all film industry. We thank him for such a powerful performance in this film, unforgettable, forever in our hearts and minds.Some people say that GLADIATOR is too violent. I admit that there are very brutal moments, especially the ones showing arena fights. Nevertheless, that is what these fights looked like. Visual effects of the movie are so stunning that I was lost in admiration. Commodus's triumphant entrance to Rome (a bit exaggerated in size but representing not that much a city but rather its power), the sequence at Zucchabar, a fictional Roman province set in Mauretania Caesariensis, the imperial palace, the brutal battle in the woods of Germania - all is filled with unforgettable grandeur! The locations at Morocco, Malta, Italy and Spain add a thrill to the spectacle.And the music... it is half of the whole entertainment to watch GLADIATOR without the admiration of its excellent musical pieces. It is a flow from sentimentalism, through exotic sounds to the tunes expressing the gore of the arena. I loved the title song, it touched my heart. There is something like a gentle power in it...GLADIATOR is in many aspects a film that will become a cult movie, not only an ancient epic but a masterpiece of movie art. When I was a boy, I was saddened by the fact that I don't live in such times like the 1950s when great masterpieces were released like BEN HUR, QUO VADIS or THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. Yet, GLADIATOR made my dream come true. We all do live in such times, the times of great movies and this is, without doubt, one of such films. 10/10!They were just shadows and dust. However, who among them would predict that they would once (in almost 2000 years) be the characters of such a film masterpiece. So were only the emperors immortal?",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

who cares about historical inaccuracy?,"GLADIATOR is a fantastic achievement in modern filmmaking. I never expected to ever see another Roman epic, but Ridley Scott has proved it is possible. What's so great about this movie is that it has a really entertaining and enthralling storyline, not just special effects and action (although it has a lot of that): it knows how to make us care about the people in it and how to develop a sense of style and elegance (thanks to director Ridley Scott). The movie is fueled by a number of powerhouse performances: Russell Crowe is perfect as the title character, I loved Oliver Reed as Proximo, and Joaquin Phoenix made a perfectly hissable villain. I was amazed at how exciting this movie was. Although the opening battle sequence is not very promising, with its confusing, chaotic editing, after that it's just uphill: the film will send you on roller-coaster ride of nonstop thrills. The effects are very well done: there is a scene where we see Commodus arrive at Rome as the new emperor that's absolutely breathtaking. I also loved the way they recreated the Colosseum. Parts of this movie are truly awe-ispiring. The fights in the arenas are spectacularly sensational. I must also mention John Mathieson's absolutely beautiful cinematography and Hans Zimmer's perfect music score. Some scenes where Mathieson's visuals and Zimmer's music mix are undescribably beautiful and breathtaking. The entire film is beautiful: just about any frame of it would make a really good poster to stick on the wall.

Great Acting,"What can I say?  Gladiator was a great film.  It cunningly blends political satire, acting, action, and fun into to a film, right? WRONG.Gladiator is more than just a fun-filled, oscar-winning, controversial action-fest.  If you look below the surface, Gladiator has many facets of itself that makes a step above the rest.First, compliments to Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix (who was wrongly denied the Supporting Actor Oscar.)  One of the best examples of why this film is unusual is because of how varied and developed (or fleshed-out) the characters are.Another important thing to remember is that the film is not necessarily meant to be taken as a pinnacle masterpiece of the ages.  Though the film is portrayed quite artistically and has the ability to touch the audience on an emotional level, some scenes are just intended for fun (or shock value, whichever suits you best.)And so, though I haven't much to say for this one, I enjoyed, and its one that will make a small impression on the American public (emotionally, not economically.)",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Blood And Sand,"In the 1950s, Hollywood insiders began to realize that television was a threat to their main source of income. As the audiences were declining at the cinemas, something drastic had to be done. So, the studios launched a number of big-budget, historical epics. Films like ""Quo Vadis"", ""Ben-Hur"" and ""Spartacus"" would hopefully attract moviegoers back to the theaters. The sword-and-sandal genre was born.In 1963, however, ""Cleopatra"" put a damper on things. The movie was such a gigantic fiasco that the studio behind it almost went bankrupt. After that there were no sword-and-sandals flicks made for many years. Until the turn of the century, that is. At that point the British director Ridley Scott decided to single-handedly revive the long-lost genre. And he did it with confidence and style in ""Gladiator"".The film takes place in the year 180, when the Roman Empire is in chaos. A general is betrayed, and is forced to become a gladiator. At the Colosseum, he must fight other unfortunate men to the death.Principal photography began in January 1999 on the Mediterranean island of Malta. But the film crew ran into trouble directly. The script was still not quite finished, and many in the cast complained about the writing quality throughout the long shot. Then things got even worse when one of the main actors, Oliver Reed, suffered a fatal heart attack before shooting could be wrapped up. The post-production company had to create a digital body for the remaining scenes involving Reed's character. A complicated (and costly) operation.Despite its troublesome production, ""Gladiator"" became one of the year's most successful films. It grossed over $500 million worldwide. And apparently the picture is still close to Ridley Scott's heart. In the summer of 2023, more than 20 years after the original movie, he started filming ""Gladiator 2"" in Morocco.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
#1- The transition of a top general to a gladiator to the savior of Rome,"The best movie ever made. One of the first to move me to tears at the end. Excellent plot, direction and acting. All else pales in comparison. I dare you to watch it because it will blow your mind. And for the losers that think they should nitpick about the historical accuracy of it, or the existence of the characters: It's fiction not a documentary of the gladiatorial lifestyles. The movie paints a beautiful view of Rome, its armies, the leaders and the land. Again, the acting is impeccable. In fact, the movie is so well done, there have been rip offs of it made. For instance, see Troy. A mediocre film with mediocre actors. As well, the direction is so much better. The fight scenes in Gladiator are beautiful, yet don't focus on the gore, as if to make some cheesy thriller. It's all about the plot, and the results are delicious. The movie never gets old. It is an emotional roller-coaster. The beauty, the heartbreak, the fighting, is all so amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Rote Revenge Pic Poses as Historical Epic,"""Gladiator"", winner of the Best Picture Academy Award in 2001, is less a historical epic of swords, sandals, and the fate of a mighty empire, and more of a bloated B-movie about a guy with a gloomy face seeking revenge for the murder of his family. ""Death Wish"" in Ancient Rome, if you will.Thanks to director Ridley Scott it's a very pretty picture to look at: the icy blue light of a wintry Germanic battlefield, the amber hue of the emperor's throne room, and the Coliseum littered with rose petals like confetti. The many gruesome gladiatorial fight scenes are frenetically paced, visceral if not actually coherent. Some of the modern special effects, however, like the CGI cityscapes, look a bit crude, even by 1999's standards.The script, like most of the scripts that Ridley Scott works from, is strictly rough-draft material. The characters are shallow, the dialogue is stilted and awkward, and the story tries too hard to intertwine the drama of the Roman political arena with the action of the hero's central journey in the more literal arena -- the former scenes only serve as breathing room between the latter scenes, which are the real meat of the film. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix make the most out of their limited roles -- Crowe's terse delivery and brooding eyes establish his character better than the writer ever could -- but veterans Richard Harris and Oliver Reed nearly vanish into parts that ask too little of their great talents.In the end it doesn't feel like a proper epic: it's not the sort of epoch-defining story that spans years and continents and a huge historical canvas, like ""Ben-Hur"" or ""Spartacus"" were -- or Anthony Mann's ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" which told essentially the same story in 1964. It's not even ""Braveheart"", another gory, overblown revenge flick. It's trying to be big and important, but it has nothing important to say; its only purpose is to construct a framework for swordfights.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
a perfect waste of celluloid,Not sure were to start. A great director a very fine cast. A pointless movie. It starts with again a PotC soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. I'm perfectly sure he can write an excellent score but he has been hiding that virtue for a very long time. I'm almost convinced that Mr. Ridley Scott let Mr. George Lucas take the honor's. The characters are quite as flat as they are on Star Wars 1 2 and 3. Even cinematography makes you squirm. Zoom in on a actor while he is monologuing? That hasn't been done since the 70ties and was dealt with there and than. Both Ben Hur and Spartacus were done over 40 years ago and were more convincing and better acted. Also watch Titus and be really stunned by acting soundtrack and story.skip it,5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Great Movie,I find this movie great from all sides i mean actors music and every thing. It can be the best movie talking about this certain period of time. Also being able to convince people of every action the hero makes is great. The movie had great sound effects that added more greatness to the movie. The hero was general maximus acted by russell crowe who made the best role in his career in this movie. The movie shows corruption and hatred that is being found in human beings in all times and vengeance that fills the hearts. The greatest parts in the movie is the parts when the gladiators fight for their live(kill or die). The fights where pictured perfectly . Also what made me like that movie was the story as talks about a man who was a general and then became a slave the a gladiator and then he challenges Cesar to a fight for death that is amusing and special.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

This had everything movies like Spartacus and Ben Hur had, plus a bit extra since special effects are so much more advanced.  The storylines which were woven together I found compelling.

"Swords, sandals, battlefields and an amazingly poignant struggle at its core ¬ñ it has all you could ask for in an epic Roman saga, plus well-placed flair and fury.","""They tell me your son squealed like a girl when they nailed him to the cross. And your wife moaned like a whore when they ravaged her again and again... and again.""Gladiator is an amazing story of revenge. It is a story of one man's struggle to challenge the emperor of Rome, wearing nothing but slaves' attire, being sold as a gladiator for the people's morbid amusement, and seeking vengeance for having his family murdered through these 'games'. It is also a political story about justice in the midst of corruption, interwoven with swords, sandals and battlefields √° la epic war saga. This, my friends, is a true underdog story with a hero so poignant that it is impossible not to be engrossed in his struggle.Whatever _I_ will say about this film will simply be semi-coherent, rambling praise as I like the works of Ridley Scott so much. However, far from everyone liked Gladiator (2000). Roger Ebert disliked it. Moviegoers criticized it for being unoriginal ¬ñ a mild rip-off of Spartacus (1960) and the likes. It may have been warmly received by the Academy, but audiences were very divided when it was released. I'd like to think that I am usually able to see things from other people's perspective, but just this once, how could you not be entertained?So although I usually trust Roger Ebert a great deal, I have absolutely no idea what he was on about in panning the film for its gloomy tone and ""muddy, fuzzy and indistinct"" skies. Maybe he simply forgot to clean his widescreen TV, because the Gladiator I know sees hugely epic games under a brilliant blue sky in the coliseum, a glorious tournament that is so entertaining because of its flair. The final battle has ROSES RAINING FROM THE SKY! It does not get more vivid or colourful than that.These battle-scenes of Gladiator are, of course, extremely well tended to by Ridley Scott who is the master at crafting epic war scenarios (see, I told you fanboy-praise would sneak its way in!). The patient, slow pacing of the film seems to take a sudden halt here, and then fast-forward in an amazingly rapid-fire pace with quick shots, swinging swords, vivid skies and a great score by Hans Zimmer to further emphasize the dramatic mood.The very culmination of this is not at the end, but rather early. It is the moment that Maximus (a superb Russell Crowe) removes his helmet, reveals his identity and faces the emperor, after a long and ferocious battle. It is a scene so poignant that I always wish it would have been saved until later on in the film, thereby giving it even more weight. But no matter, because rest assured that it is goosebumps-inducing enough.A gloriously entertaining, heartfelt and carefully crafted war adventure by Ridley Scott in which little feels missing or incomplete. What more could you ask for? Great acting from the cast, I suppose ¬ñ well, this is also present in Gladiator. Best of all, the actors have good dialogue to work with so they don't choke on the dated lines. Russell Crowe propels this film with his heroic personality, Connie Nielsen adds introspective depth, and Joaquin Phoenix is excellent as the twisted but idealist emperor Commodurus.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"""ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?!?""","I have been waiting for years to watch this movie. My dad never let me because it was rated r and I wasn't old enough. i finally turned 15 and he let me watch it. Very very good movie. If only my dad let me watch it unedited with all the violence it probably would be even better. I keep telling my dad I can handle the violence and I am not a scared little boy, and he edited out like all of the bloody fighting. And what is crazy is that we watched The Patriot (2000) and he edited like nothing. We saw almost everything from that movie. Ive heard that movie was more violent than this one. Whatever.
I still loved it even though almost all of the violence was cut out from my dad. The plot was really good and the quotes are really memorable. Can't wait till im older and I leave my dads house and watch this with all the violence. But till then i will have to say this was a great movie even though it would probably be better with the violence",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A bit disillusioned after the second view,"I don't remember when I watched Gladiator the first time, probably on TV a few years after it released, as a teenager. I do remember I liked it and had been holding it in high regard since.Thus, I convinced my wife, who hadn't seen it, to watch it with me. Unfortunately, I didn't find it as good this time around.For me, the movie works because of three main components:The emotional impact brought about by Hans Zimmer's amazing score.Joaquin Phoenix's great acting as the despicable Commodus (if you're given the role of the baddie and everybody reviles your character after watching the movie, you must have done a good job, right?)The glorious battle set-pieces.These things do a good job elevating the movie from what would otherwise be a run-of-the-mill Hollywood epic. They also keep you from wondering too much whether what is happening on screen makes sense. But suspending disbelief is still kind of difficult, particularly in the opening act, with questions like:What exactly did Commodus gain from having Maximus' family butchered, so that he had to send his Praetorians to the other end of the continent to do it?After escaping his executioners, why did Maximus not immediately return to his troops, who by all accounts would have done anything for him, and just cut the whole story short?How the hell did Maximus - a single man with two horses - get from Germany to Spain in 180 AD?. That's an achievement worthy of its own movie ... if you forget the fact that he was wounded and had no supplies.Anyway, the movie is good, just not the masterpiece I figured it to be. And my wife liked it, so ...",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The great epic movies were finally surpassed,"This movie is so well done, that you are overwhelmed. I can frankly say that there is not even a single boring moment during the whole length. I will begin my description with the shooting. The movie has such great shots, that you will be truly impressed. There wasn't any saving made by the producers with the staging of the scenery. It has been set to resemble perfectly the Roman times. The fighting scenes in the gladiator's arena are shocking, but tastefully done. Actually, the movie begins with a battle between a Roman legion and a German tribe's army. Great shots! It is much better than the fights in Braveheart. The other impressive side of the movie is the consistency of the plot. The movie has a coherent plot which sends us a clear picture of the happenings, without limiting the suspension. You cannot guess the end of the movie at all, and neither the next step, but as it happens it is logic. The last but not least is Crowe's acting. I have never heard about this actor until this movie, but he plays very well. He is manly and sensitive altogether. I commend its casting, when other candidates were more known. You just have to see this movie, and you will be convinced that the great epic era of the fifties was finally reproduced and surpassed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Brilliant,"Great action, story and acting. Full marks for being one of the best films ever made.It is not historically accurate with the plot but that's not the point (it seems a mash of different events and people who existed at one time or another in during the Roman Empire. From what I know of ancient Rome the story is within the realms of possibility.)The characters are all great. Pheonix is annoying but intentionally so - he acts his character perfectly. The script is kind of poetic at times - it seems it underwent at least three full scale revisions by different masters of script writing.There are a number of different accents in the film but then Rome was probably a pretty multicultural place and we're hardly going to wish they had made it in Latin.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A Masterpiece Of Polished Pulp Cinema,"GLADIATOR is a masterpiece of polished pulp Cinema with all the right ingredients: visceral fights and battles; a beautiful, mysterious woman; a villain you love to hate and a hero with a code of honor (and arms like tree trunks); it has all the drama and heartbreaking betrayals and tragic deaths of a Telenovela and as much blood and testosterone as you'd find in a Rambo movie. It's simply glorious, spectacularly entertaining filmmaking - all delivered straight to the gut and without a shred of irony.And boy is this violent revenge tale and journey to ancient Rome beautiful to look at: every shot is framed like a painting; it's one of those gorgeous looking Ridley Scott films where every landscape becomes as much a protagonist of the film as the actors in it. As for those actors, they are never less than magnetic to watch, and especially Joaquin Phoenix and Russell Crowe stand out; they bring an intensity and all-in approach to their roles that garnered them both Oscar nominations (Crowe won his).I sometimes hear the argument by certain self-professed film critics that GLADIATOR is too pulpy to really be considered a good film. I couldn't agree less. This is one rousing adventure and one beautiful movie with a fantastic cast - and it knows exactly what it wants, and it achieves it to a degree of perfection. It's about as cinematic an experience as film can offer, and it's as watchable today as it was nearly 20 years ago.P.S.

Still Amazing Twenty Years Later,"Gladiator deserves every ounce of praise it got at the time (and debatably deserved more), and still gets to this day. It's a stirring story of revenge against the backdrop of Roman glory, with a game played off between the stoicism of Maximus against the cruel envy of Commodus over the people's adoration. It becomes as much about the back-alley politicking and public perceptions as it does the fights within the arena itself. Maximus is the pinnacle of masculinity and heroism against Commodus' despicable antagonist, an underdog against powers greater than himself. And when Maximus gets his revenge and collapses on the floor to meet his wife and son in the afterlife, it hits with the emotional weight it has earned.

Maximus Movie,"We thought that the star of director Ridley Scott was going to disappear thanks to unsuccessful movies like the good  ""Albatross"" or the really weird ""G. I.

Even if doesn't absolutely respect history, this movie is a beautiful work and a great wonder for our eyes. Scott directs the battle with great ability, helped by the editing of the great Italian Pietro Scalia (Academy Award winner for ""JFK""): the initial battle in the woods is frenetic and impressive with the force of a thunder and the fights in the arenas are exceptional, a demonstration of what the evolution in movies can do. And also the cast, which sometimes is sacrificed for the show, shows a very great power: Russell Crowe is a suffering but determined Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix an evil, weak and complex Commodus, Connie Nielsen is so beautiful than good actress and then there is a great english trio formed by Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi and Oliver Reed (dead during the shots). Giorgio Cantarini (Benigni's son in ""La Vita √® Bella"") plays the brief role of Maximus' son.

Maximus Excitus Entertainius.,"In the event of his death, ageing Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) intends to leave his trusted Hispano-Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius (Russell Crowe) in charge of Rome, instead of allowing his son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) to become his successor. Commodus has other ideas: he murders his father and orders Maximus to be executed. Maximus, not one to give up quietly, makes a daring escape, and, badly wounded, heads for home, where he discovers that his wife and son have been crucified on Commodus' orders. Passing out from the pain of his injury, Maximus is captured by slavers, nursed back to health and forced to fight as a gladiator. This new life eventually leads him to the Colosseum of Rome, where he finally comes face to face with the man who betrayed him.From director Ridley Scott, Gladiator is a historical epic to rival the classics from the 'golden age' of Hollywood. Opening in 180 A.D., with a brilliantly orchestrated battle between the Roman armies and the tribes of Germania, Scott's film grabs the viewer's full attention from the outset and doesn't let go until the end, having delivered an Oscar-winning central performance from Crowe, a memorable score by Hans Zimmer, excellent supporting roles from the likes of Harris, Phoenix, Connie Nielsen and Oliver Reed, and some of the most impressively bloody scenes of hand to hand combat ever filmed.If I were to choose my favourite scene, it would be the 're-enactment' of the battle of Carthage, a savage piece of action cinema in which Maximus and his fellow gladiators are ushered into the arena like cattle to the slaughter, only to turn the tables on their attackers, winning the hearts of the Roman masses in the process. A rousing, blood drenched spectacle, it's a fine example of Scott's expert direction, a masterclass in camera placement and movement, editing (the violence is extreme, but the film doesn't wallow in the gore), sound design and special effects, which still thrills even after all of these years.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Good epic film...overall grade: 8 (out of 10).,"The best way to analyze this film is to compare it to another famous gladiator film, Spartacus (1960).Kirk Douglas (Spartacus) vs. Russell Crowe (Maximus Decimus Meridius)The winner is: Russell Crowe (by a long shot).   I liked Russell Crowe in this film.  His performance is what keeps the movie generated with electricity from start to finish.  Although Douglas was good as Spartacus, I found Crowe's performance much better.Laurence Olivier (Crassus) vs. Joaquin Phoenix (Commodus)The winner is: Laurence Olivier.  No actor could steal a screen performance like Olivier.  Phoenix goes overboard with his character in some scenes.Peter Ustinov (Lentulus Batiatus) vs. Oliver Reed (Proximo)The winner is: a draw.I liked both characters from each film.  Ustinov won an Oscar for his Supporting role, but Reed was equally impressive, too.Direction: Stanley Kubrick vs. Ridley ScottThe winner is: Kubrick (by a long shot).Special Effects:  The winner is Spartacus.  One example is the mammoth battle scene towards the end of the film.  Gladiator is littered with computerized special effects.I feel Spartacus still holds my interest as best gladiator film ever made. The only thing that holds Gladiator together is Crowe's performance.Spartacus: 8.5 (out of 10). Gladiator: 8 (out of 10).",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Ave!,"Okay, I'll admit that I didn't consider ""Gladiator"" the best movie of 2000, but it did have it's merits, namely that it focused on plot rather than violence. Russell Crowe certainly did a good job as Maximus, and Joaquin Phoenix made a nasty Commodus. Although that was sort of the problem: the good guy was 100% good and the bad guy was 100% bad. It might have been a little better if there had been some gray area.But other than that, it was a really good movie.

a masterpiece,gladiator is a classic movie. it is a masterpiece. it is a film that one should not miss. talking about the movie the starting was very gripping that holds a viewer for rest of the movie. then the story of the movie unfolds at a good pace that is enough to maintain the interest of the viewer. when the hero returns to his home and sees his house in ruins those scenes were very touching. costumes are also very good. i think story of the movie was excellent. the direction was also good. the fight scenes in the fighting arena were breath taking. and in the end the ending was perfect.i also liked the background music of the film it goes with the mood of the film.and at last the acting of all the actors specially Russell crowe was perfect which proved cherry on the cake.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Gladiator: A Grand Spectacle Marred by Simplistic Characterization,"""Gladiator"" stands as a cinematic spectacle, immersing viewers in the grandeur of its historical context with stunning visuals and epic scale. The portrayal of ancient Rome is both visually and narratively compelling, offering a rich backdrop to the story. However, the film's Manichaean approach results in characters that often feel one-dimensional, lacking the depth and complexity that could have elevated the narrative. This black-and-white portrayal leads to somewhat predictable character arcs, detracting from the film's otherwise impressive scope. Despite this, ""Gladiator"" remains a memorable experience for its grandiosity and historical immersion.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Too many errors and an actor made out of wood,"There are a couple of reasons I didn't really like Gladiator.First and foremost is Russell Crowe. I'm an Australian and while it seems a little unpatriotic, the guy is pure wood. He is the new Charles Bronson who has one expression and sticks to it.Thus I had a problem when he supposedly 'sells himself to the crowd'. I'm also a wrestling fan and I can only guess that 'selling' must mean something different to the people who made this film. Crowe does no selling here.The other problem I have is some biiiiig holes in the plot. Commodus becomes the new Emperor and sentences Maximus, and his family, to death. Maximus kills the guards and rides as fast as he can for home. So fast he kills both of the horses he rides although he might have been a little faster if the cinematographer didn't decide that he absolutely had to put in some visual effect to boost his career.Anyway, he gets home and Roman legions had already arrived, tortured and raped his family, hanged them and then left. My question, how did they know? Did Commodus, still up in Germanica somewhere pull out his cell phone and make a call?! I mean, Maximus goes as fast as he can but the enemy troops seem to not only know Commodus' orders but that he is the new Emperor.A friend of mine said that there were communication methods that could have been used. Carrier pigeons, signal towers, etc. Fine, but if the film makers want me to buy that, they should show me this.Next, Maximus falls to the ground grieving for his dead family and then boom, next scene, he's a wounded slave. How did this happen? Even more curious is why a slaver bothered with caring for a wounded slave with the Mediterranean so close by to act as a dumping ground.Third, I still can't understand how Maximus manages to become such an acclaimed gladiator. Nothing I saw endured me toward him and while he was a general that doesn't make him an exceptional fighter. I don't know if I'd win a fight against General Schwarzkopf or Collin Powell but I bet Mike Tyson could beat them in a fight.Finally, all the other anachronisms just added up to cause my poor suspension of disbelief to evaporate.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
GLADIATOR: THE STORY THAT TOUCHES THE HEART,"When I first saw this movie it reminded me of Braveheart.  Then I thought to myself that this movie posses a quality that Braveheart does not.  It possesses the quality that you get satisfaction at the end of the movie.  In Braveheart you do not get satisfaction at the end and it is difficult to watch many times.  I believe that that is the reason why Braveheart didn't do as well as Gladiator did in the box office but did win 5 Oscars.  This movie is a work of art.  The score complements the movie so well. Lisa Gerrard and Hans Zimmer deliver the movie in music notes rather than words. Russell Crowe is great in the movie and reminds me alot of Richard Burton. He is an up and coming star who is destined 2 win an Oscar.  Joaquin Phoenix also delivers a great performance worthy of an Oscar.  The late Oliver Reed is outstanding.  Reed seems to steal the scene that he is in from all the other actors because of his acting power.  Ridley Scott delivers a classic film that will remain in our memory and our hearts.

"6.7/10 - Yeah, Quite Entertaining","""ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?!""Gladiator, directed by Ridley Scott, is a historical-fiction/drama film that takes place in the Roman Empire. It follows Maximus (Russell Crowe), once a general of a Roman legion, and now a slave who fights for entertainment as a gladiator in the arena. Even as a slave, he doesn't break and he yearns for one thing - getting his sword right to the throat of Commodus (Joaqin Phoenix), the emperor who destroyed his life.This movie is considered a classic by many, a masterpiece by some, and I gotta say - it's quite hard for me to see why exactly it's like that.I mean, I like some aspects of the film, sure. It has some cool shots, Crowe and Phoenix give solid performances, several fight scenes are kinda badass. Alright. But everything just feels so...I don't know, like a Hollywood clich√©? It doesn't feel special in any way, shape or form.Let's focus on Crowe and Phoenix for a moment - their characters have an interesting dynamic, one a stoic hero with natural charisma and a solid set of principles, while the other is a lonely, deceptive man-child with troubled mind and a lack of social skills. As I said, performances are solid and (as you probably know already) these actors act well. But yet, I have no strong feelings about them at all. Yeah, I want to know what happens next when their plans collide and they have this struggle of sorts, but it's nothing more than a mild interest. Things never feel unique, captivating, creative.To be honest, I think that ultimately this is my problem with reviewing this film - I have very little to say cause the film just doesn't invoke more than an occasional feeling of mild interest or disgust or joy in me. Scattered moments with no consistency, yeah, but this film is not bad either. It doesn't have any element that I think is horribly executed. It's fine, it's okay, it's even kind of enjoyable. Despite being so Hollywoodish it's still, for a lack of a better word, entertaining.So yes Maximus, I was, in fact, entertained. Not as much as I could've been, and I was definitely not very immersed in the film, but I still feel like it wasn't such a bad time. Directing is not bad, plenty of cool fight scenes, some quotable lines and badass moments here and there. Way too clich√© to be a masterpiece, a classic or even have much of a rewatch value for me, but it's not a bad movie at all. I'm feeling a 6.7/10 on this one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Good but not great,"Roman General Maximus has everything going for him - he is a highly skilled and successful general, he has a wife and child whom he adores, the people love him and the aging Emperor loves him.

Commodus has Maximus wife and child murdered. Maximus escapes before being executed himself, only to be captured and enslaved. He becomes a gladiator and fights to regain his status. Moreover, he is determined to take revenge on Commodus.A good, but not great, action-drama. Plot is pretty much your standard revenge story, set in Roman times.

Dreary spectacle,"Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting ""Democracy"" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"Imperfect, but engaging and entertaining","Gladiator strives to be more then a brainless big-budget action movie, in that sense, it deserves credit. The question is, though, does Gladiator actually manage to do this?In a way, yes. The storyline, while fairly linear and lacking a huge amount of complexity, manages to give proper motivation to each character and it flows smoothly. There never is any doubt what a character is doing in any given scene. The characters are even well-defined, which is more than can be said for the vast majority of its ilk.However, Gladiator does have its problems. There is no joy, and little emotion to this movie. Everyone who is in this movie is either vengeful, depressed, angry, or just plain said. It's a rather cold movie, in that way... compared to its fellow Best Picture nominee Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (which exudes warmth and emotion), Gladiator is extremely cold and joyless. While the storyline does do a good job of saying why everyone acts like this, it still doesnt help the fact that the movie is extremely cold. Im not asking for a tacked-on love story, just a little bit more emotion then anger or depression.Still, that aside, the movie does manage to stay entertaining. Some parts dont seem to flow quite well, but, for the most part, it is good. The many facets of what is going on (for example, Commodus' dealings with the Senate) are well represented, and Ridley Scott manages to do a good job of sticking with these topics and dealing with them.Gladiator has its fair share of special effects, and they are very nice. Fitting in with the theme of the movie, however, much of it is filmed in drab earth tones. The early scenes are extremely blue or red, but never in between. Compared to a movie like ""Titus"" (to be fair, that movie only kinda-sorta takes place in Rome, but I digress), Gladiator is quite dull looking. Still, most of it does fit - the Colosseums look as one would think, as does everything else. But the movie definitely is not vivid, nor beautiful to look at. But it does look nice. A lot of the camerawork is good, but a special point must be made about some battle sequences (both the opening, and some effects used in the gladiator battles). There is just too much herky-jerky effects... enough to distract one from the actual event. In Braveheart or Saving Private Ryan, the camera moved around a lot, to be sure, but at least one still got a good feel for what is going on. With this movie, the cameraman fell so in love with these techniques that he neglected that people would actually want to know whats going on.Still, in spite of these flaws (some more significant then others), Gladiator is a very good movie. It is entertaining (although it does get boring at parts) and it does tell a good tale. However, compared to a movie like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (the two movies do have a lot of similar elements), Gladiator does come out as being the inferior one. But, that doesnt mean it's a bad movie - in fact, its probably worth a spot in a movie fan's collection.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Gladiator could by all means be called the greatest movie ever made, though i wouldn't, but it's up there with the best of the best.Visually this film is perfect. The CGI, the combat, the sound and editing is some of the finest ever seen in cinema history.Although some of the story didn't really happen in real life, i still think the storytelling is flawless. It's truly amazing, but also an incredibly sad and tragic story with probably the most beautiful ending ever.Russell Crowe as Maximus is brilliant and the role fits him perfectly. His best role and performance ever. But the stand out performance for me was Joaquin Phoenix portraying the evil emperor Commodus.

Hell of a ride,"A combination of all the best parts of Saving Private Ryan, Braveheart, and The Lion King, Gladiator opens, carrying itself like the great Roman war machine portrayed, then grabs the viewer and drags them through the story of Maximus.  His adoption into the gladiator lifestyle is almost as intense and emotional off the battle field as it is on.  Where Braveheart called for the audience to laugh or be shocked by the images on screen, Gladiator carries a much more personal feeling to their battles (mainly due to the size), allowing them to rile up much more emotional steam that has ever been seen in a war epic.  A veiwer must wonder as they watch, is it right that I support the brutality, is it right that I am rooting for a man to kill another?  It's quite an emotional movie, wait until you see it.Despite the moral conflict, the movie is still amazing.  Russell Crowe is, as always, amazing, and Joaquin Phoenix has turned what is probably his best performance of his career.  Ridley Scott's directing is excellent, keeping true to the worn, hot, aged feel of a gladiator movie, while at the same time, incorporating many techniques to heighten the experience, going inside the minds of the characters.It runs around two and a half hours, not too long for a Gladiator pic, and is naughtily entertaining.  Lots of blood.  Lots of gory battles.  Lots of extremely exciting battles, everything a gladiator movie should have.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A movie that will not be remembered 20 years from now as a great film,"I love good action films, the kind that entertain and enthrall, and every once in a while leave a viewer in awe. I love gladiator movies. Since childhood, I have been a fan of swordfighting and swashbuckling melodramas, as most young boys are. There is nothing wrong with the fun in them, because every once in while a great one like ""Spartacus"" and ""Braveheart"" comes along, a truly epic film that not only pierces the eye, but the imagination as well. Those films were not just spectacle, but had real heart in them. They contained stories that worked with enough good writing and direction to move beyond just a popcorn flick. The film ""Gladiator"" did not. I know people love this film, that even many critics called it a wonderful success. In that light, I tried hard to like it. I sat down twice in the theater and once at home to give it an honest look, but sadly, a new revelation never came. At best, it is just an action flick, and since I love these types of movies so much, that label saddens me all the more.Here is my argument. Many claim that the action scenes were the best they had seen. I thought those claims were simply caught up in the flashy technique that was used, but not the resulting experience. Director Ridley Scott used quick cuts and blurry hand-held camera work to film the fighting scenes, copying much of the same style that Spielberg introduced in ""Saving Private Ryan""'s opening sequence. It places the viewer almost inside the battle with the same kind of confusion that a soldier might feel. All fine and dandy in a modern battle that uses guns and explosives, weapons that require little skill to use or watch on screen, but in mid-evil warfare, I would like to actually see and understand the fighting with swords that takes a focused camera to capture. It can be done. ""Braveheart"" gave scenes just as strong in action, and much more understandable. those scenes were enthralling, and are still the standard in my opinion. Sadly, every action scene in this movie was much the same: blurry, quick cutting, not easy to understand, and therefore not easy to enjoy. I wanted to scream at the screen ""Just let me watch the fighting!!!"" This movie was not trying to make some great statement about war or its time, like the Spielberg film, and therefore did not need to go all artistic for not reason at the moment the crowd is supposed to sit back and enjoy the ride. Since the action let me down so much, it was now the job of the plot to pull me along.There were many things that worked in this film concerning the plot. The actors were very good, particularly Richard Harris in the beginning as Caesar. Many scenes worked by themselves, but did not really add up to a complete picture. Often I felt like the characters were acting a particular way not because the story had given them any real motivation to, but because the plot required it for the moment. When Maximus was needed to be mad, or noble, or depressed, or vengeful, or hopeful, or hopeless, he simply was. The man was a rollercoaster of emotion in this film, but his reason for being such was not consistantly shown. A plot cannot drive the characters, it must be driven by them and what they would actually do if they existed. While it was all handled well by Russel Crowe, a fine actor, it made me feel manipulated as the viewer.Overall, it was a popcorn flick, a movie to entertain, but to challenge, and certainly not to win an Academy Award, the worst presented in years. The special effects were very noticable, made so to appear ""wowing"", but they detracted from the reality instead of enhancing it. I do not understand why people think ""Gladiator"" is greater than it is, a movie that will not be remembered 20 years from now as a great film, unlike other films that were nominated right along side of it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

All the cliches ever made up rolled into one movie,"My girlfriend had heard several great reviews from her friends so i had to be dragged to see 'gladiator', even though i had a very bad feeling about it.. Well, all my expectations were met, every cliche in the book was there and the worst part was that they were not even performed well. The whole movie tries very hard to radiate grandeur and epic heroism but it just totally fails. Acting was crap, most actors were statues talking without intonation while Crowe walked around the whole movie looking worried and silly and not like the heroic general he was supposed to be.. Music was junk (didn't expect it at all from Hans Zimmer, normally excellent..). The whole movie just didn't have the atmosphere it could have had. If you wanna see a good movie with Crowe watch The Insider (far better music too, incidentally also by Lisa Gerrard who did Gladiator together with Zimmer).",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The film Napoleon wishes it could have been.,"After recently watching Napoleon it's amazing how such an epic film such as Gladiator still almost 24 years on is as enthralling as it was the first time I watched it all those many years ago.Over the years I've had this on dvd, blu ray and now 4k and no doubt if they ever update physical media again I'd purchase it again in a heartbeat.I don't think, seeing as we now live in the digital steaming age where even paying for something with cash these days is a rarity they will update physical media again but it could happen.What can I say about this film that hasn't already been said the acting, story, cinematography, direction, music its all flawless. This is one of those true gems of cinema that stands the test of time like the godfather 1 and 2, alien, alien's, the shawshank redemption, one flew over the cuckoo's nest, psycho, its a wonderful life and so so many more that have that special place reserved in history for film greatness True works of art one and all that resonated with us then and always will.Obviously with the title I made I had to make a mention about Napoleon because it has the same actor, same director but yet comparing the two films is like trying to compare night and day and yes Ridley Scott is now 84, yes they were beholden to mandatory covid restrictions whilst filming Napoleon plus I recenlty learned that the films financiers held both the film and Ridley back and a lot didnt get into the film but I find it astounding how 2 fims that have so many similarities couldn't be further apart.Maybe because of the state of modern day cinema Hollywood doesn't know how to budget because when u take a recent film such as Godzilla minus one with the small budget they made that with and the worldwide praise anf financial success its had. That whole film was made with less money than one episode of she hulk. That is a fact and I know which one I plan on watching coz it's got a monster init and he ain't twerking.I'll save my rant for my Napoleon review but needless to say if Napoleon had only had the vision and the passion of fhis film I think I would have enjoyed it more. But like I said I'll leave that for my Napoleon review.I do believe we will have more films like this. They just very rarely come from Hollywood anymore but I am hopeful for dune 2, but I pretty much focus on foreign cinema and shows these days moslty Korean and indie films because its very rare we get the good old Hollywood blockbusters anymore. But this year we've had John Wick 4, Openheimer and I believe top gun Maverick was this year too so maybe Hollywood's not dead yet but it certainly has more flops than it does successes.Hope everyone's safe and healthy and everyone is having a festive time of the year or enjoying themselves if they don't celebrate Christmas.

Today I saw a film become more powerful than any other...,"Critique: 8 out of 10Back in 1959, MGM released a film that critic's hailed and audiences adored. This film went on to win eleven academy awards, and instantly becoming a classic all around the world. This was director William Wyler's Ben-Hur. Nearly 40 years after that, comes an epic-like film, with a similar storyline, titled Gladiator. An entertaining, well-made movie, that brings back the treasures of yesterday.The plot, although original, is cleverly written by screenplay writer's, David Franzoni, John Logan, and William Nicholson. General Maximus (Russell Crowe) the greatest military leader Rome has ever had. After defeating, the Germanic renegades, Maximus is looking toward going home to his wife and son soon. Yet, the dying Emperor, Marcus Aurelius wishes to give the throne over toward Maximus, instead of the rightful heir his reckless son, Commodus. Maximus isn't thrilled about the idea, and tells the Emperor he'll think about his decision. Though, before Maximus can give his answer, Commodus hears about this and kills his father out of anger. Commodus takes the throne immediately, and asks for Maximus support.When Maximus doesn't give it, Commodus is furious and orders to execute him and his family. While Maximus barley escapes, he family doesn't. Wounded emotionally and physically, Maximus passes out, only to be captured by slave traders. Purchased by a former Gladiator, Proximus (Oliver Reed), Maximus finds himself competing in small gladiator contests. As Maximus becomes more popular, he discovers he may be able to take revenge on the man who killed his family.Director Ridley Scott (""Blade Runner"", ""Hannibal"") brings to the screen, some enormous cinematography, making you feel as if you were right there among the characters. The Gladiator fight scenes are brought to life, from clever camera angles, and the frequent shaking of the camera.Russell Crowe (""Proof of Life"", ""The Insider"") performs wonderfully, and brings to life his character's emotions. Joaquin Phoenix, plays the corrupt young Emperor well, and delivers a believable performance being crude, selfish, and full of hate against Maximus.Supporting Actress Connie Neilson, (""Mission to Mars,"" ""Soldier"") plays the emperors sister, and Maximus former love interest (something that should have been discussed a bit more). Oliver Reed, does a fantastic job as Proximo, the retired Gladiator, who's quest is to help Maximus win his freedom.Violence. This movie is filled with it, from a man being sliced in half, from decapitation's. While, I wouldn't have made the film this gory, it does make for a completely realistic feel!This film is a wonderful, it has a few flaws, but besides them it has become an instant classic around the world. Though, not everyone will enjoy this film as much as I did, it's worth seeing. I give it: 8 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Principal characters like emperor Commodus and his sister stand around pouting and plotting what to do next and relapse into animal fables on the meaning of power. Yawn! And here's where the film makers really missed theboat: with a hunk like Russell Crowe as star, they didn't contrive one scene in a Roman bath!

Padded out to make it feel more 'epic',"Gladiator is a long film. Epic films are supposed to be long. But somehow Gladiator doesn't feel like an epic film. Sure, it deals with the rise and fall of a Roman Emperor, has spectacular battle scenes, a nearly spectacular CGI Colosseum, and everyone speaks in the clipped 'BBC English' accent that we all know they used in Roman times, but somehow the story doesn't carry enough weight.We feel bad for Maximus when he's betrayed, and we hate the villain and want him to get his comeuppance. But we don't give a toss about the Roman people, who are portrayed as a bloodthirsty mob, so why should we want them to be freed from their tyrannical emperor? It works better as a personal revenge tale than as a chapter in the history of the Roman Empire.The script is weighed down with pretentious and meaningless pronouncements (""Rome is an idea""?) and the plot is too full of coincidences. The action sequences are well executed (if you'll excuse the pun) and none of the actors embarrass themselves, but overall this is an above average film that has ideas above its station.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

An exceptional viewing,"Despite the fact that what we saw are Historical Fiction (Marcus Aurilious died from the flu, Maximus Desimus Meridious only existed as Aelious Maximus and HE did not kill commodus in the arena), this film had the great support of Ridley Scott's exceptional story telling and offcourse the great casting. Russell Crowe won the Oscar, in my opinion, on the opening scene and when he found his family dead. The Shorow scene must be classified as one of the most touching and emotional moments ever seen. Commodus was exceptional as well as all the other supporting actors. The music of the film is a clasical masterpiece. One of the finest orchestrations, despite the fact that many sounds were ""known"" to the experienced audience. Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerard (from The Dead Can Dance) completed a fully tensioned and emotional soundrack. The screenplay based on a historical fantasy idea had some gaps but the dialoges between the characters were very good like the one in the end of the movie between Gladator and Commodus: Glad: I had a friend once who said to me, when death smiles at you the only thing you can do is to smile back at him Commo: And what did your friend do when he died? Dlad: You should know, he was your father. Now to the directing of Ridley Scott. He is a very talanted director who knows in perfection what it means to create vision out of a text. Even in Hanniball his directing was strong, solid and thick. Here in Gladiator he shows as a perfect age illustration, he uses all the means (camera music photography) at their extremes in order to create a solid appearence of his film. The usage of visuall effects are effective. The best part of his job is the characters. Everyone that appeared there did everything with a reason based on real or close to real people. He used historical reports and evoluted them to solid 3 dimensional people. The character of Maximus was not the ""ancient Rambo"", he cries, smiles, crashes, fights, supports, beleive like a man who may live round as. Marcus Aurilious was perfect, you respected him only by the colour of his voice and the tension on his face. Commodus was the most common ""bad"" person but he was presented to each extremes. The movie is one of the best and one of my favorite amd it asure as that Ridley Scott will continue to offer us pleasure in the Dark room.He did great work so many years (ALIEN, Bladerunner, Thelma and Luise, 1492, Black Hawk Down).

Not the classic it wishes it was.,"With Oscar weekend just passed I decided to dig out a film that had won loads of Oscars, and nominated for even more. I went for Gladiator, a flick I hadn't seen for at least five years, which five years ago I remember thinking wasn't anything special.And apart from the action sequences, that view still holds. Sure, the coliseum scenes are something special - possibly some of the great action scenes ever shot, but they are let down by a mess of a film, full of bad dialogue, gaping plot holes and bad acting.Russell 'I can only do one expression' Crowe, is perhaps one of the films biggest let downs, he can't decided whether he is a emotionless bad ass, not giving a damn whether he dies or not, or whether he is an emotionally fragile man. I've never been a big fan of Crowe, but especially in the role of Maximus, I feel it is one of the film's hindrances.The dialogue is camp and cartoony, with one of the first lines ""Why can't people just admit when they've been conquered?!"" appearing completely inappropriate for a savage battle scene. Throughout the film the dialogue is one of the recurring problems, which makes itself apparent when it appears self-aware or over-sincere (""You must live or I shall die"").Also, we're meant to believe that Maximus can escape the Roman army and travel undetected from Germania back to Spain, but wait he can't escape from a shoddy little slave ring. Its plot holes like this that mean that Gladiator can't be the classic it badly wants to be.However, it does have quite a few redeeming factors, such as the fact that it is really well directed by Ridley Scott (his choice of panning camera shots and brilliant intimate feel to the battle scenes have to be seen to be believed). And Joaquin Phoenix is spot on as Commodus, never choosing to portray him as a straight bad guy, but the most multi-dimensional character in the film.Oh yeah, and the soundtrack is great too!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Scott's attention to detail in the set and costume design is chef's kiss - it's like a time machine back to the Colosseum.Now, let's talk about Crowe's performance. This guy delivers such a raw, emotional, and powerful portrayal of a betrayed general turned gladiator that you can't help but root for him every step of the way. And let's not forget Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus - what a villain! The guy can make your skin crawl with just one sinister look, and his performance is nothing short of Oscar-worthy.The musical score by Hans Zimmer is just the cherry on top of this epic sundae.

A general in ancient Rome is forced to flee the land after not bowing before the new Emperor ( who killed his own father to be Emporer). And so Maximus ( the general) becomes a slave and must battle through Gladiator combat, hoping to avenge the death of the original emperor.           The film is packed with pulsating and gruesome violence and yet incredible acting abillity. 9.5 out of 10.   PSSSST! if you watch one of the chariot battles carefully, you can see a gas canister which the film makers needed to flip over one of the chariots!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Cliche, but good nonetheless","Acting (10)Exceptional performances from the entire cast. Of particular note are
Phoenix's portrayal of the petulant emperor and Crowe's honorable,
vengeful Maximus.Plot (4)The plot is simple, and at times unrealistic. For example, it wasn't
clear why the crowd in the Colosseum was okay with their emperor
deciding to duel Maximus. Wouldn't this have been incredibly strange?Characters (5)The characters are largely cliche and uninteresting. Gracchus and
Proximo had potential, but weren't developed enough.Sound (9)The music was wonderful. Gave the film an epic feel. I really liked
""Honor Him"".Cinematography (6)Nothing special. CGI Colosseum looked a bit choppy.Enjoyment (8)This is a revenge story that ends well. While simple, the plot is one

The critics are crazy,"After having just seen Gladiator with my wife for the third time, I can definitely give it a 10.

Great historical film,"As a retired history teacher, I know that much of the history shown in this film is wildly inaccurate. It bears only a very superficial semblance to the facts and it's a shame, as the true story of Emperor Commodus would make for an exciting film. In addition, at times I felt as if the dialog was just awful. Too often, folks talks as if they were making speeches or delivering lines in a high school play. And, it turns out I am not alone. After the film, I read through the IMDb trivia and noticed that the actors ALSO hated the dialog and much of it was changed....though in my opinion, not enough of it was changed. There was often no emotion other than rage or boredom from Maximus, for example. His grief at the crucifixion of his family sounded LESS emotional than it should have--like he was upset that the commissary forgot to but cheese on his burger--not like a man grief-stricken with loss. Simply put, the human side to the film is stilted.So what you are left with is a WILDLY exciting film--a true spectacle. But it lacks the humanity and truth that would have made it even better. Still, it's well worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"Massimo, Massimo, Massimo","Who hasn't seen Gladiator at least once? If we did this survey we would probably be amazed and if we asked who had seen it more than once we would be even more surprised. Ridley Scott not only managed to exalt the 50,000 Romans in the Colosseum (to quote the film) but practically the entire world. Paradoxically, the story of General Massimo Decimo Meridio has only one limit: it is almost entirely invented, but invented at the highest possible level. So well structured that many still believe that General Massimo really existed and performed similar deeds. Some phrases from the film have become cult, a source of inspiration for slogans especially in sporting and social events and the story of the gladiators has forever acquired an indelible image in the eyes of the world, that of Massimo.

Highly enjoyable hokum,"""Gladiator"" is hokum. Let's begin there. It's highly cheesy - but it's quality cheese. It's nice cheese. I like to eat this cheese.The premise is absurdly simple - Maximus Meridus (Russell Crowe) loses his family and his command after refusing to pledge alliegance to the psychotic new Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Pheonix) because Commodus is a loony and killed his own father to gain power, fearing (rightly) his dad was about to dissolve the role of Emperor. So he ends up being a gladiator and uses his skills to rise up and get a chance to wreak vengeance. So no points for plot and there a few historical inaccuracies but hey, it's Hollywood! We expect it..It's the acting and conviction placed into the characters that helps move this movie upwards. Crowe is great - and hey he won an Oscar for his role here. Real sense of the gritty determination he has and check out his ""And I will have my vengeance - in this life or the next"" speech- fantastic fun. Joaquin Pheonix camps it up a little as Commodus and is devilishly enjoyable as the slimy, lecherous, cowardly ruler. Fun fun fun. All the other plays similarly play well here.Ridley Scott puts enough energy into this movie to draw you in. Sure you can argue the battles are done with flashy fast moving camera work in a bid to distract you - there's some truth to that. So what? It looks nice. ""Gladiator"" doesn't have pretensions on being a highly morale and deep tale - it's a fun blockbuster! It's slick and well done. Maybe you can detract points for Zimmer's overly present musical score or the overly heavy imagery of wheat-fields etc. but in the end it doesn't matter. ""Gladiator"" doesn't have enough to make it one of my favourite movies but it does have more than enough to lift it above the general dross.

Death smiles on us all...,"...all a man can do is smile back.In a way that line sums up this movie.On the surface it comes across as a simple action thriller... and it is, in many ways. The dialog is stilted,the story unoriginal,the character's archetypes, the political commentary unsubtle and the ending predictable.But what transcends this film is the undercurrent themes of hope, despair and loneliness.For example, the film's villain Commodus at first seems like your typical villain but Phoenix shows us a lonely,scared,love-starved boy capable of kindness and worthy of our empathy.In his scenes with his sister Lucilla the two actors lift it away from just being about incest to a study of a relationship of poignant dependency.Lucilla half hates her brother -and deep down he knows this- but he overlooks this because he desperately needs her.Lucilla too is a lost soul, revealed in a line to Maximus:''I have felt alone all my life,except with you.''The film says one crucial thing about human nature-our capacity for enjoying the pain of others. We are watching people watching people die. And we enjoy the death and violence as much as the Romans did. But the film's ending offer's some-perhaps unattainable-hope and is, in a odd way an affirmation of life.What Gladiator doe's best is bring to life a world now lost. If I ever go to the Colosseum in Rome, I will not now see the rows of empty seats but hope,terror,hatred,cruelty, small kindness,desperate courage,and even heroism..in short.. all Humanity.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"""What we do in life echoes in eternity""","""Gladiator"" is an epic movie. I have only seen this masterpiece now because the film did not appeal to me due to its historical component and appeared to me as a monotonous and boring film. Now that I have seen it, I would say to me in the past not to think about anything and start seeing because this is a film not to be missed. The plot is super addictive: the film is about Maximus, the general of the Roman army of the North, who after the death of the emperor Marcus Aurelius does not reserve loyalty for the new emperor Commodus. After the murder of his wife and son, Maximus begins to live in death and loneliness to survive, seeking revenge as a final mission before death and reunion with his family. The film is written perfectly, with spectacular and cult dialogues and monologues, unforgettable. The film was not boring at all, in fact I loved it and never got bored. Much due to the splendid soundtracks of Zimmer, literally a music magician, but also by the perfect performances of Russel Crowe as Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix as Commodo, but also Richard Harris, Connie Nielsen and all the others were fundamental. I have no other word in mind but ""perfection"" to describe the costumes, they made me crazy, especially those of Maximus. Also I think that the film, although it was released almost 25 years ago, has aged very well, being close to today's level. Obviously there are areas such as audio-visual that are slightly backward, but at the time you could not do any better than this. Ridley Scott's organization was perfect, with a spectacular direction and shots that gave a ""plus"" to the scenes, giving it a much more strained impact. I loved the Roman setting, especially the arenas, fabulous. The emotional component of the film is strong, especially in Maximus and with him in the finale of the film, which is wonderful. I would also say that the Oscars are well deserved. It would have been a crime not to give the Oscar to Russell Crowe, Janty Yates' costumes and Scott Millan's sound. I'm also surprised that Zimmer didn't win anything. In any case, ""The Gladiator"" is one of the films that has marked and will continue to mark cinema history and also represents one of my favorite movies..

Mindless and Predictable.,"Gladiator is filled with so many tired old cliches that I can only sum it up with a tired old reviewer clich√©.  Leave you brain at the door.This movie starts off with a large battle scene where Roman army Sargent, Russell Crowe, displays a unique ability to fight with courage and honor. Yeah!  Unfortunately for him he is more concern with getting home to his family where he can raise his children and grow his crops.  The only thing that is keeping him in the army is a strong devotion to his Caesar.After winning the opening scene (Believe me, I am not spoiling anything imdb.) Crowe's Caesar comes down from the mountain where he has overlooked the battle to congratulate him.  As soon as I saw the old and feeble Caesar get off his horse I literally counted the seconds before the Caesar's `jealous of Crowe' younger brother or son came walking onto the scene.  28 seconds later the Caesar's son who it conveniently late for the battle, enters the scene. Things really heat up when the Caesar names Crowe as his successor instead of his son.  What follows is one movie clich√© after another until a final battle scene between Crowe and Caesar Jr.I have enjoyed movies that followed this kind of formula in the past. Spartacus and Braveheart are my two favorite examples.  But what those movies have that Gladiator lacks is simple.  Character.  Ridley Scott's direction should have been more focus on giving his lead roles a third dimension instead of dragging out action.  The bland story and flatness of the characters made me wish that everyone would die so I could arrive home sooner.Although Gladiator did have well choreographed fight scenes and some good computer generated special effects; as most movies today, they left the script as a last priority which this reviewer still believes should be the whole point of movie making.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

A marvellous comeback of the roman era movies,"Gladiator is an extraordinary classic film. Its one of those that will be watched and talked about 50 years from now. Maximus is a Roman general who is framed and betrayed. He ends up as a gladiator fighting in the great Colosseum. The whole story is about the fall and rise of the hero, an honourable man who is motivated by a thirst for revenge and a promise he once gave to the emperor. I remember when I was in school reading about the element of adventure in Greek plays. Adventure is : ""the change from happiness to misery or the opposite"". If this is right then this movie is one of the most adventurous movies ever made because it is based on this description. About the movie now, the acting was breathtaking by everyone, the directing was amazing giving the film a live, fast action character.

I must admit that I was not that impressed with Joaquin Phoenix at first, but on further review, I realized that he was actually very good... his character is a spoiled simpering evil dude, and he played it to the hilt, with a British accent (because we all know English was the language of Rome, and everyone who was anyone in the Roman empire spoke with a Royal Shakespearean accent).  Oliver Reed, Derek Jacoby, and Richard Harris were wonderful of course, as was Djimon Honshou, and then there's Russell Crowe... He is definitely the heart and soul of this film, and if THIS film doesn't get him the respect he's due, then nothing will. And anyone who thought the light saber duel in Star Wars Episode I was impressive (as I did -- my favorite part of that movie) will be completely bowled over by the fight sequences in this film.  Very bloody, but very well choreographed and incredibly filmed.  AND -- this movie has a heart!

In one scene we see him pouring lustfully over his sleeping 8-year-old nephew.  The fact that he also sought sex with his sister does not remove this charge, this was simply to add to his unnaturalness. 4,  appalling computer graphics 5,  needlessly gruesome violence that managed to glamorise violence and reduced us to the level of the crowd watching the gladiators in the colloseum. 6, too long 7, the actor playing the villain was entirely unintelligible.One good point was Russell Crowe, but he should have known better than to get embroiled in this disgrace.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
I am entertained,"I¬¥m watching this because I¬¥m watching the sequel soon that probably doesn't have much to do with this one and because I¬¥m going to review the sequel on my new podcast so I might as well have more to talk about.What Ridley Scott always set out to do is make grandness. No matter the film I feel like Scott comes from this visually strong perspective that creates these formfilling worlds. You feel transported back to this ancient world and find it believable because that is what Scott intended. Where this movie lacks for me is the basic story it tells when it had an opportunity to really make a huge drama about so much more than revenge. The story doesn't engage with me that much, but the sceptical always will.After being asked to be the new ruler of Rome. Maximus is betrayed by the current leaders son, who kills his father and has maximus killed. Maximus escapes and is picked up to be a gladiator now seeking revenge.The cinematography in this movie is phenomenal. So many beautiful shots and great uses of the camera in a world that is also using a fair amount of effects. John Mathieson shows skills in terms of creating beautiful frames and movements that really creates an epic feeling movie. Now this doesn't always apply to the battle scenes that sometimes can be too chaotic and hard to read. I get the feeling of trying to make the battels feel chaotic, but at the same time sometimes the movie just seem like it is cutting together whatever footage they could get of a battle. I most also put into question the amount of slow-motion used in this movie. I get the use when it¬¥s supposed to simulate someone is fast of time felt slowed down for a character but sometimes it feels unnecessary and distracting.Where I feel like the movie should have added more is with the story. It becomes a rather basic revenge plot and that¬¥s not a problem it¬¥s just a Hollywood movie I have seen a million times now. Rather than having a magnum or a sword doesn't make it much different, different coat of paint so to speak. This movie is more than 2 hours so it has the time to make it a political drama too. Make it about why Commodus is a bad leader for Rome and why Maximus would be a good leader. These aspects are more told than shown and making Commodus a bad guy by making him unconfutable isn¬¥t really that engaging to me, show me how bad of a leader he is, show me his selflessness, show me why Maximus is a better leader other than begin a general and being able to rally people, actually tell me maximus would be a better leader other than just saying vague things. Again this is what would elevate the movie for me.The action is pretty fun though. The set pieces are entertaining and seeing the different challenges are engaging. Sword combat is just great but again I wish it was framed better via the camera.The effects are incredible! Other than a few arrows, birds and one screen other than that the effects holds up. This is a movie from 2000 and I still can¬¥t tell sometimes where the effects start and the practical ends. This is also because it is not supposed to be looked at in the same way. Yes it¬¥s impressive and is showed off that colosseum is a thing in all its glory, but it keeps the empathies on the action and characters and is not just a thing made to show off. Using the great effects as a backdrop more than a forefront makes it work so much better.The production design is out of this world. Again that I don¬¥t know where the practical and effects start and stop is incredible. But everything from locations to building designs to costumes to hair all really transports you to this world.The acting is incredible here! So many stand out moments here. Russell Crowe as maximus gives a powerhouse performance showing so many emotions from start to finish. Joaquin Phoenix is a dastardly villain as Commodus, creating this disgusting but so well acted human that makes you feel just a smitch of sympathy for him. Other great performances are Richard Harris and Oliver Reed both giving great acting for the small screentime they have.The score is so good and really elevates the scenes. The fighting the more emotional moments, all work so well here. Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrad really showed off here. It is funny how much it sounds like the Pirates of the Caribbean (2003) a score Zimmer also worked on.Gladiator is a good movie but could, to me, have been a true epic had it focused a bit more on the world around itself instead of just the arena. It is an epic and it is grand, it¬¥s production is incredible and it sells the world it¬¥s supposed to. A rather basic revenge plot makes it simple but effective in what it sets out to do.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

The plot really lacked originality. This was actually the ROMAN VERSION of BRAVE HEART or the latest version of BEN HUR rather than gladiator. I cannot understand why such a stale plot was used...Secondly,, the visual effects were fairly poor, apart from being realistic. For instance the tiger was like a character of one of Disney's animations. It was obviously non-realistic.. And it was also too obvious that the upper part of the coliseum was computer-generated..In the next place, the movie was unreasonably long; long enough to bore the audience.

"My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius. Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife...And I will have my vengeance, In this life or the next.","The Gladiator has to be one of the best movies of the century. It achieved something that I think no other movie has achieved since. It is a pure cult action movie that managed to win an Oscar while all the critics, the watchers and the Oscars themselves have been treating action movies and especially superhero movies unfairly for at least 30 years or more. And that's because the movie is so good as a movie that at a certain point you almost forget what you are watching. The dialogues/lines and small details in this movie are insanely good, the acting was amazing especially from Joaquin Phoenix and the action is just out of this world. Yet again for me it's those things you'll notice if you rewatch the movie that make it what it is. They don't make movies like that no more. Nowadays most action movies give emphasis only to action, CGI and sometimes an interesting plot...Well, movies like The Gladiator have proved that there is way more things playing an important role in such movies. I don't really want to describe these scenes here because I will be spoiling the best parts of the movie. To sum up, In my opinion the Gladiator is arguably the most Legendary as well as one of the best if not the best action movie of the 21st century. Next time you sit and watch the Gladiator, try to scan the movie and analyze it a bit and next time you see and action movie released after 2001, notice how many things are replicated (but not duplicated). How many Gladiator lines have been marked in the books of filmmaking history? How many scenes? How many cinematographic tricks? How many acting performances have been inspired from Russell Crowe's as a protagonist and Joaquin Phoenix's as an antagonist? I hate judging entertainment products or any type of product prior to it's release but I find it almost impossible for the second movie to live up to the expectations automatically created from the first movie. I haven't yet seen ''Napoleon'' to be able to judge Riddley Scott's current work but my last hope is that he himself will decide to honor his own and the movie's legacy. And what I'm also very afraid of having to do with the movie, is the fact that it will be forced by the society and the conditions of 2024 to...''adapt'' to the modern rationales and opinions, If you know what I mean...However I am not writing this review to talk about the aforementioned.

The summer starts with this triumphant Gladiator,"This is not Braveheart, the war drama about Scotland's quest for freedom. This is a character study, a comic book, a video game. Ridley Scott and his screenwriters find intelligent ways to give us everything we would ever want to see in a gladiator film. It doesn't aim to teach or evoke pathos, but to entertain like the gladiators themselves. To the film's credit, it does its job admirably.Russell Crowe is back from Jeffrey Wigand and returns to raging Bud White mode. He carries the film in a breath-taking stride, even though his Aussie-accent is difficult to cover up at first. Joaquin Phoenix is the best costumed villainous fop since Tim Roth of Rob Roy.And the battle scenes are rousing, combining the violent red-throated carnage of Braveheart with the you-are-there shaky-cam of Saving Private Ryan to impression results. And the film actually FEELS like Rome, a feat that for all their glory (varying though) Spartacus and Ben-Hur haven't been able to muster up as they've aged.Gladiator is a terrific way to spend two-and-a-half hours and one of the best non-stop action flicks since Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Terminator.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Timeless,"Gladiator is one of those movies that will never be outdated. It will never need to be remade or need anything else done to it. It stands on its own like few other movies do. Crowe's performance as Maximus (I think I spelled that right) is subtle and stoic, yet perfect. He is the perfect hero archetype and it ends fulfilling that archetype perfectly. The story, whether how accurate it is to ancient Rome or not, is incredible. Even if we must view it as a fantasy film, the story would not become diluted in any way. If you have not seen Gladiator, you should go buy it at a F.Y.E or Moviestop location (it's very cheap now) and if you have seen it then I'm sure you agree with me and if you have seen it and don't agree with me, whatever, but you're absolutely wrong.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Gladiator? I hardly know her.,"'Gladiator (2000)' tells the story of a Roman general who, after being betrayed and having his family killed, finds himself rising up the ranks as, you guessed it, a gladiator and using his new role to get closer to his revenge. In many ways, it's somewhat of a sweeping epic, with large outdoor environments and massive battle sequences accompanying the classic vengeance-driven melodrama of its narrative. While a lot of the backgrounds feel intangible in that specifically turn-of-the-millennium way that also affects something like 'Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (2001)', the picture remains an impressive achievement to this day. Immersing you in Ancient Rome and its various locals and traditions, Ridley Scott's historical action-drama remains engaging throughout its slightly bloated runtime. The set-pieces are shot with quite a bit of shaky cam and edited in a purposefully frenetic fashion, but they're mostly legible and convey the brutality of combat in a relatively visceral way. The performances are all really sturdy and the music, while undeniably uneven, often soars just as much as it stirs. The moments in which the picture explores its more spiritual aspects are surprisingly effective, beautifully ethereal moments that add a much needed gentle side to the otherwise potentially boringly macho affair. Ultimately, this is an entertaining and well-made effort that isn't massively deep but is consistently compelling and sometimes rather moving.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Mediocrity - How Ridley Scott yet again neglects the script in favour of the image,"It wasn't surprising really. I should have known better, after all this had happened with the narratives in Legend, 1492.., Black Rain and even in his superior works Alien and Blade Runner(and will happen again, like Peter Pan?). Hope however springs eternal, and with the casting of Derick Jacobi some comparisons with the sublime I, Claudius were inevitably and subconsciously drawn. How desperately in need of those comparisons was this dire cocktail of flashy, confusing gore and risible 'intrigue' performed by a collection of actors who, with a few exceptions, appeared to have recourse to one facial expression to express the gamut of emotions required of them by an infantile, ludicrous and totally implausible script which took 2 1/2 hours to deliver a plot which could have been written on the back of a postage stamp.Are we so easily satisfied with mediocrity that we can praise this ramshackle, gloomy hi-tech affair as being the first 'epic' of the year 2000? Surely not. Even the highpoints of the film; the opening battle scenes and the chariots vs gladiators coliseum fight come nowhere near to matching the virtuoso displays in Saving Private Ryan and Spartacus.For the rest, give me a script instead of computer-generated images which if I want to watch I can do so on one of my son's computer games.Now if Mr Jacobi had been a screenwriter ...",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A cut above....,"...the standard Sword 'n Sandal epic. Russell Crowe propels this film in a tour de force of a performance, ably supported by a solid supporting cast. Even the often appalling Oliver Reed does good work in his last film. Ridley Scott directs this film with a deft touch, heavy where he needs to be, violent and brutal, but not gratuitous, and with a good eye for the spectacular.The plot stretches credibility in the latter half and I for one feel that Maximus' identity was exposed to the evil Commodus just a bit too early on. Commodus - what a villain, played with just a touch of camp by Joaquin Phoenix. Swarthy, oily, murderous, cowardly, lusting disgustingly after his own sister, what other name could one give such a character than a Latinised word for ""toilet"". One of the most repulsive creations ever put on celluloid by an actor. Can't blame him though, there had to be something substantial to match Crowe's massive screen presence.

"Gripping tale of honor, betrayal, and vengeance.","Stunning visuals, CGI, and wonderful performances by Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Oliver Reed, and Richard Harrison combine to make this film a delight to experience.  My only complaint is that Crowe's ""General Maximus"" comes off as a bit too much of an innocent for his lofty position as a commander of legions of men.  Crowe manages, in spite of this, to make you believe Maximus is a commanding man, a true leader.  Ridley Scott certainly cast the best man for the job.  Joaquin Phoenix made me emotionally squirm in my seat every time he came on the screen.  His depiction of the nearly sociopathic son of the Emperor is a role he is clearly well capable of playing.

Really good film with an opening battle scene that is incredible!,"Loved this movie but the best sequence was at the beginning when the disciplined, methodical, Roman Army slaughtered a disorganized German horde in a filmed battle sequence with no equal other than perhaps the storming of Normandy beach from Spielberg's movie Saving Private Ryan! Tactics will beat brute force every time! The emperor overseeing this slaughter was Marcus Aurelius who was the last of the adoptive emperors, also referred to as the 'Good Emperors'. It started with Nerva, who adopted Trajan, who in turn adopted Hadrian, who was followed by Antoninus Pius who in turn was succeeded by Marcus Aurelius. During their rule there was a considerable expansion of the Roman empire, from northern Britain to Dacia and to Arabia and Mesopotamia, followed by a consolidation and an attempt to perfect the empire's defenses (e.g. Hadrian's Wall in Britain). This all started to unravel under Commodus (son of Marcus Aurelius). The period of the adoptive emperors started with the assassination of a horrible emperor (Domitian) and ended with another horrible emperor (Commodus who also was assassinated). This is all historical fact and that's the end of the movie's factual content everything else is just fiction!

Crowe is outstanding in this bloody Roman epic,"At the centre of the pic is a solid performance by Russell Crowe, which should finally cement his reputation as one of Hollywood's brightest new stars. He's as tough and mean as he was in LA Confidential with a likeable heroic edge.Director Ridley Scott manages a near return to form. The action scenes are visually impressive, but somewhat messy, but I suppose he'd say he was capturing the chaos of battle.There are numerous panoramic Roman vistas but they're obviously, for the most part, CGI (and are strangely always accompanied by poorly executed flocks of CGI birds). Also, to my eye, it was clear which of Oliver Reed's scenes were re-edited with doubles and/or digital composites.These are minor grumbles though -- for the most part Gladiator is a mean, bloody, sprawling epic. The supporting cast are all great: Connie Nielsen is as alluring as ever, Joaquim Phoenix is a fine baddie (despite being slightly miscast; occasionally struggling with a british accent) and Richard Harris is great in a small role.On the whole the script is strong but, as is often the case with blockbusters, it's unfortunately drowned out by sound effects and, in this case, by a heavy-handed score.My main grumble is the film begins with a Saving Private Ryan style battle sequence, contains numerous large scale action sequences in the interim, but the finale is just a plain-old run-of-the-mill two man swordfight. Yes, it's very exciting but it felt like it needed a grander end fight.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Director Ridley Scott's sword-and-sandal, blood-and-guts spectacular isn't anything original, yet it certainly looks good and has many moments of power and emotion. Scott tries for the sweep of a latter-day ""Spartacus"", but the script isn't as intriguing and the film, while entertaining on the whole, isn't as memorable. Dedicated to actor Oliver Reed (Proximo), who makes his final film appearance, this Oscar winner for Best Picture has old-fashioned ideals transposed after the new-fangled violence, with lots of bloody action to snare modern moviegoers; it works successfully enough, and Scott efficiently uses the long running-time to build character and dramatic tension. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Riotously campy success in the ""guilty pleasure"" genre, but much too long due to pretense of being some kind of intellectual high tragedy.","Finally saw Gladiator. Now that's guilty pleasure. Definitely a guy movie, as men outnumbered women three to one in audience. Star Wars, popular as it was, made the mistake of actually being about something; I'm happy to say that Gladiator has no redeeming value whatever. Just blood, mud and crud. Some of the killing made me laugh out loud, like when Crowe stabbed a guy with two swords and then chopped off his head while he was still standing. When Oliver Reed went into that monologue, accompanied by full orchestra, about the thrill of the cheering crowd I almost thought he was going to sing There's No Business Like Show Business. You know something is a bit over the top when one of the most restrained performances comes from Richard Harris! Another big laugh was when Crowe and Djimon win the crowd over by becoming the first ""tag team"" gladiators in pre-television history. Film pictures all the gladiators as united against some unnamed enemy over on the other side of the arena, thus daintily skirting the more Spartacus-like reality that the gladiators fought and killed each other -- and therefore, presumably, were hard put to have indulged themselves in the kind of emotional ties we see here. When the leading lady (Connie Nielsen, in fact just about the only woman) arranges to meet Crowe privately, she explains for the audience's sake that patrician women purchased sexual favors this way all the time. Seems to me everybody onscreen would know that already! It's like in The Mikado where Yum Yum turns halfway toward the audience and says to Nanky Poo ""But darling, you forget: in Japan..."" except that in the latter case WS Gilbert meant it as a joke.The one thing that dampened the pace was long dialogue scenes between the battles, as if the movie were hunting desperately for some intellectual point that would justify its existence, not unlike the '63 Cleopatra in that way. Unnecessary in either case, serving only to protract the running time. Gladiator should be at least a half hour shorter than it is. Audience ate it up, though.A friend commented ""Gladiator will live on TNT and USA forever!"" but I think she underestimates basic cable: there will probably also be a series starring Lorenzo Lamas.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
One of the all time best,"""The Gladiator"" follows the story of Maximus Decimus Meridius, a fictional General in the Roman army set during the historical era of Marcus Aurelius' reign as Emperor of the Roman Empire. It's important to remember when watching this film that it's not historically accurate but rather a sort of ""fan fiction""What makes this movie so great for me is the broad spectrum of narratives in the film itself. Ranging everything from love, friendship and heroism to hate, jealousy and vengeance. Gladiator is often cited as one of Ridley Scotts best films and rightly so as both the screenplay and cinematography are an amazing feat. It also feature one of the most iconic scores in cinema history, with brilliant work from Hans Zimmer.Though this film isn't perfect(but then again what film ever is) and has many flaws it's not hard to find it has elements that even the best director fail at done exceptionally well, which is why it resonates with so many viewers. Its often critiqued as being massively overrated mostly by people with expectations set unrealistically high, who pick apart only whats wrong with the film and give no credit where its due, like for instance the casting of Russel Crowe to play the character of Maximus, who suited the role so well that its arguably the crowing achievement of his career because of the type of character he plays really plays well to Crowes brooding acting style.If you're looking for a timeless classic with great effects, exceptional cast and acting talent and brilliant story line (with one of the best endings in cinema history) then look no further.(My review for this film comes from a motivation to write a review to get the tick on the my account section on IMDb and the fact that after years of deliberation I've chosen this film as my all time favorite film.)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The textbook of hero epic narrative,"'Gladiator' lasts way more than two hours, but it does not feel that long because it follows every step of the story arc strongly and solidly. The journey of Maximus to being a hero of Rome is dramatic and draws people's empathy at the same time. By the middle of the movie, I become one of Proximo's gladiators and cheer Maximus along. I also like the fact that 'Gladiator' is not just a compilation of action scenes. It's a political drama. The portrayal of the tyrant by Phoenix is detailed, delicate, and sensitive. How he proceeds to become crueller, more obsessive, and more paranoid is illustrated perfectly. How the power against that tyrant is formed and carried out is described exquisitely as well. The whole picture is detailed and universal at the same time, and I can see the political dynamics of South Korea in 2024 in the movie.Music is superb and one of the best in cinema history. The first battle sequence is shockingly brutal and violent and shows so much slaughter while the background music is glorious and even holy. It seems like death from outside, but all the battles and fights are life to Maximus. He fights to be alive from the start to the end. He finally lives the life he has wanted by dying at the end.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Ollie Reed (RIP) gives a cracker of a performance as sports agent, Proximo, whose catch cry should be ""show me the denari"".

What was it like to be a gladiator?,"Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" (2000) takes place in 180 AD and begins with a decisive Roman victory led by General Maximus (Russell Crowe) over the Germanic tribes in what is now Austria. The Emperor (Richard Harris) is dying and wants to turn over control of the empire to the noble Maximus rather than his pathetic son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). After Commodus catches wind of this, Maximus and his family are condemned, but the general survives and winds up a slave to Proximo (Oliver Reed), who trains gladiators. Connie Nielsen is on hand as Commodus' sister who sympathizes with Maximus.I saw ""Gladiator"" in the theater when it came out. It was over-hyped at the time and, as a result, I was let down, which isn't to say it's bad‚Äînot at all‚Äîit's just not as great as the hoopla made it out to be. Maybe I was a little disappointed because it's hard to watch ""Gladiator"" without comparing it to 1960's ""Spartacus,"" the first hour of which represents some of the greatest filmmaking ever, and ""Gladiator"" is underwhelming by comparison (with the first hour anyway).Yet ""Gladiator"" has a lot of strengths, including the serious tone, the score, locations, the recreation of the Colosseum in Rome and the cast. Speaking of the cast, Crowe is probably the film's greatest strength as he makes a worthy protagonist; and Reed is no slouch as he's his typical magnetic self. Believe it or not, Reed died during filming and his remaining scenes had to have his face superimposed over an anonymous actor (!). Maximus' fellow gladiators and friends are also notable (Djimon Hounsou and Ralf Moeller). Furthermore, the arena action sequences are thrilling and indeed give you a glimpse of what it must've been like to be a gladiator.Phoenix is also exceptional as the love-to-loathe villain, but this is where the film suffers. Commodus (obviously derived from 'commode,' lol) is so repugnant and dishonorable that the viewer has no interest in watching overlong dramatic sequences of him in the palace, etc. These scenes could've easily been cut in half.While ""Gladiator"" has a simplistic revenge plot there's some depth to glean here and there. For instance, the Emperor (Harris) chooses Maximus to replace him not only because he loves him as a son, but also because he wants someone outside of the corruption of Roman government to return the empire to a republic. That's what we need in the USA, someone not tainted by Washington politics. Then there's Commodus' sister, Lucilla (Nielsen), who initially comes off ignoble, but then you start to understand her plight and sorta hope she's redeemable.As far as historical accuracy goes (***SPOILERS***), Marcus Aurelius allowed his unworthy son, Commodus, to become Emperor, knowing his incompetence BUT it is believed Aurelius wanted Claudius Pompeianus to succeed him as Caesar in preference to Commodus but was turned down, just as Maximus turned him down in the film. The fictional character of Maximus was partially based on Pompeianus, who had a similar career to Maximus' and personality traits as well, as documented by Herodian. In fact, Pompeianus married Marcus Aurelius' daughter, Lucilla, following the death of Lucius Verus. Maximus was also an amalgam of historical people like Narcissus (which was the protagonist's name in the first draft and Commodus' real-life killer), Spartacus (who, of course, led a significant slave revolt), Cincinnatus (a farmer who saved Rome from invasion, then resigned his six-month ruler-ship after 15 days), and Marcus Nonius Macrinus (a faithful general and friend of Marcus Aurelius). As for Commodus' entering the arena at the end and taking on a mighty (albeit wounded) gladiator and dying, Commodus was known to engage in show combat in the Colosseum, but he was actually strangled by the wrestler Narcissus in his bath, not killed in the arena, and he ruled for a dozen plus years, unlike the relatively short time shown in the movie.Say what you will about these (common) cinematic deviations, but the movie does inspire you to look-up the historical facts.The film runs 155 minutes (the extended cut 171 minutes) and was shot in England (the opening battle scenes), Malta, Morocco, Tuscany and Lone Pine, CA.GRADE: B-",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"uninspiring story and characters, not saved by good cinematography","The only good thing that I can say about this film is that it was shot well with careful planning in costume and excellent scenery. I cannot fault the picture/cinematography at all. But, this is the only thing the film has going for it, and this alone cannot save a film.'Gladiator' was over-rated as a classic epic of its time. The story is complex and very dull in many places, and it could have been shortened. Now, I am a big fan of historical fiction films, but this one just did not do it. The story was very weak, and I could not get into it at all. The characters were also another problem. I felt that I could not relate to them. The film is not as engaging - the characters and story are weak so much that none of the great things about this film make a difference. It is too bad because I had some high expectations for this film and the genre.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

It feels like watch a stage play with more dimension.This movie transported me to ancient times and captured my attention from the opening scene. If I have one complaint it's that there were one or two lulls where it felt like the pacing could be better.A story of love, evil, suffering, arrogance, and vengeance.

Why on Earth Did Everyone Like This Movie?,"This movie is bad.  Not extremely bad, but bad nonetheless.  It was extremely long and boring, seeing as the plot was paper-thin.  The characters were dull.  I couldn't care less, if Russell Crowe won in the end.  I didn't feel sorry for his character at any point in the movie.  In fact, by the second hour, I found myself wishing for his immediate death so they'd end the movie.  I blame most of the movie's problems on director Ridley Scott.  He's a hideous director, and I don't know why everyone keeps confusing him with a good director.  During half of the fight scenes and during the battle scene at the beginning, it took the entire scene just to figure out what was happening.  You could never tell what was going on.

Good classic,"Good classic film with Russell Crowe. The opening scene is spellbinding, showing the true gore of battle, the fight scenes are marvellously realistic, discarding the popular ""pretty"" sword fighting for brutal aggressive force. The audience in the arena express every emotion, surprise, anger, and enjoyment. The cast is brilliantly chosen; we can really see Russell Crowe as a gladiator, in Commodus, Joaquin Phoenix gives us a man we can really hate, Connie Nielson shows real emotion and passion in the role of Lucilla. So apart from the spellbinding acting, scarily realistic fight scenes and the amazing script, what else can we look for? The music is just stunning, it's exactly what we need brought in at exactly the right time, truly wonderful directing. And then we have the stunning special effects, we can really visualise the greatness that is Rome, the fight scenes really make you believe. Some critics have condemned the lack of historical fact, for instance an emperor would never fight a gladiator, and these comments cannot be denied, it's true.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

And sure, Maximus has a sad story, but sowould all of his fellow gladiators, yet we don't get to hear themwhining.

A great revenge movie that is not as worthy as it thinks it is but is still a great movie,"Maximus is the favoured commander of Emperor Aurelius' armies in Germania. He is favoured to the point that the Emperor, sensing his death is near, commands him to succeed him and return Rome to a republic.  Caesar's son discovers this, kills his father and orders Maximus dead.  However he survives and, finding his wife and son murdered, is captured by slave merchants and sold to gladiator trainer Proximo.  As his skills increase his strength he eventually comes to the games at Rome, where he finds himself anonymous and within striking distance of the revenge he seeks.If you strip away all the period settings and political battling in the background, this film is essentially a revenge film and a good one at that. It's best to ignore the liberties it takes with both logic and history and enjoy it for what it is.  At times it does threaten to take itself too seriously, but it's worthy sheen is just about supported by the emotive story and strong characters.  The film hits a good mix of political goings-on and action, with the action being the main body of the film.  It is delivered in bloody spades and the action scenes are a lot more dramatic than I expected.Although the characters fit into traditional revenge movie moulds (wronged man, evil man in position of power etc) they still manage to be strong characters in their own right.  Maximus is a strong hero and it is hard not to feel for him and thus get involved in the film.  True, the script is very generous in it's painting of him but this is a minor issue.  Crowe takes the lead really well and, while I don't personally care for him, he really fitted the role here.  Phoenix plays it well despite the fat he could easily have given into mugging the evil role.  Harris is good in his small role, although Jacobi just shows up once or twice.  Reed has a good part for his swansong but this is really Crowe's film and he commands it as his character does his army.The close of the film always gets me as it treats the characters and audience with respect (although it is not as daring as some would suggest. Overall this is a great film to watch as long as you don't take it too seriously or go looking for flaws.  The music and direction gives it a great feel ¬ñ the music in particular used to support the required emotions created by the action.  Three hours go by very quickly and enjoyably.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"A good try, but too many flaws for ""classic"" status.","Gladiator is an ambitious attempt to tell the story of a man's revenge against the backdrop of the Roman Empire. Russell Crowe stars as a successful general who is sold into slavery after being deposed by a ruthless upstart young emperor. We see him fight his way through the ranks as a gladiator and eventually square off against the young tyrant on the floor of the coliseum. Though not a historically accurate film, it is still worth seeing for a few of the fight scenes, and some of the performances.Crowe is as good as he needs to be as Maximus, the deposed general who only wishes to return home to harvest his crops after defeating a barbaric army at the film's beginning. However the dying old emperor, well-played by Richard Harris, wants to hand over control of Rome to this fine man. When the emperor's evil son hears of this plan, he kills his father and takes control of the empire. Since Maximus refuses to swear allegiance to the new emperor, he is order to be killed along with his wife and child. Maximus escapes the Roman soldiers, but is soon captured and sold into slavery as a gladiator. The rest of the film is centered around Maximus and his plans to overthrow the young emperor with the help of the emperor's sister and a few well-meaning senators.Gladiator could have been a great film, but it's a little unfocused, and some of the scenes could have been filmed a little better. For example, the opening battle starts off well. We see a fully-armed Roman army set to do battle with a Germanic hoard. We get some good shots of Roman archers and infantry men launching a barrage of arrows and flaming debris on the barbarians, and that looks pretty impressive. However, when the battle becomes hand-to-hand combat, everything becomes too murky and hard to follow. Some of the fight scenes between gladiators have the same sort of problems. Maximus, as his instructor tells him, does in fact kill too quickly. Sometimes he has dispatched five or six men without us even realizing how he did it. True he was an experienced soldier who would have gone for quick and efficient kills, but the spectacle is lost in some instances. The re-created Battle of Carthage is probably the most memorable combat scene, and it works fairly well.Few of the characters in this film are likable or well-defined. Oliver Reed gets the best lines, but his character is never fully developed to the point that we understand him. This could be the result of his untimely death during filming, though. Connie Nielsen and Derek Jacobi also have curious roles in the sense that we never really know who's side they are on, or if they are only using Maximus. There is an implied close relationship between both Maximus and Nielsen's character, but it leads nowhere. When I first saw this film, I thought Jaoquin Phoenix was over-acting badly, but now I'm not so sure. It is more than likely that a young emperor of Rome would have behaved with selfishness and paranoia, and Phoenix seems to revel in his role.Overall, this film reminds me quite a bit of Conan the Barbarian. We have similar scenes and themes throughout. Also, we even get an appearance by Sven Thorsen who played a bad guy in Conan. Here, he plays a former champion who comes out of retirement to challenge Maximus in one exciting scene.This film is really no better than Conan The Barbarian, and Crowe lacks Ahnold's charisma and physique.Bottom line: 7 of 10 stars. Worth a look, but not really Best Picture material.The hound has spoken.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Epically overrated - even the music,"This picture is epically overrated- it is not the number 46 of the 250 best movies, like the IMDb ratings system states at the time of writing of this review. Because it simply never should have been even near such top 250 list. Aside from a clearly visible big budget, only three things are worth of mentioning: shots of hand brushing thorough stalks of wheat (which are iconic), ""Are you not entertained?!"" shout out moment (of intensive emotions) and the point of story when there is a conspiracy created ""to get him out"" (which in turn leads to a few minutes of enjoyable suspense). Other than that, this picture is quite boring and mediocreIt is suppose to be an epic story, but it does not suck you in on any scale. Instead of that it just epically blows, like if it was a giant blown egg shell- decorated on the outside, but empty on the inside. Even the very first battle in the woods has some stupid visual techniques, with addition of some dog disguised as a wolf saving his master- and what a load of kitsch that was. And the kitsch comes back in epic size at the grand finale- the only missing thing at that point is a group of gladiators singing ""Kumbaya"" to the crowd of cheering and crying spectatorsIn this picture even the music is way below expectations. Yes, there are some good moments, but overall in the beginning and at the end the music is rather weak, while in the middle it is somewhat without a taste or noticeable substance. And what is more, the Wikipedia says that Hans Zimmer took some of this music from Gustav Holst and Richard Wagner. But there is more to it- most likely he also borrows from Henryk Gorecki. And on top of that, some tracks sound like a reworked version of music from ""The Rock"" [1996]"", which Hans Zimmer co-composed; and also there is a musical motive in the ""Gladiator"" that he later on simply reused for the ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" movie series. But what is the most disturbing in regards to the score is the fact, that he got nominated for that work by Academy Awards, while the co-composer Lisa Gerrard did not. So it is just ridiculous that the music which is at best mediocre got nominated, but at the same time it is scandalous, that only the man of the two persons that created it received such nomination. (Of course all those Oscars prizes for music / songs should not be viewed as something like some kind of musical Metre Convention agreements)But what is most important- it does not matter, if you watch this movie in crappy conditions at the time of its release when you are entering your young adulthood, or if you watch it some 15 years later on a good home cinema system when you are an adult. It is still boring and also flat to some extentDo not waste your time on this one. Go watch a ""Spartacus"" (2004) instead- although it is a TV movie and was not intended to play in the same league as Ridley Scott does with his big bucks flicks, that ""Spartacus"" beats the ""Gladiator"" almost to the ground (but also in no way constitutes as one of the 250 greatest movies ever made)",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
gladiator,"Gladiator is an extraordinary film because it is very spectacular and, at the same time, powerful, intense, vibrant, with a remarkable introspective analysis and representation.It also gives people a positive and edifying message. This film is accompanied by a splendid sound track, sometimes strong and intense, sometimes passionate and touching, that increase its value. Some passages of this sound track remind the music of Beethoven. In my opinion the film deserved more than five Oscars. In fact given that Gladiator in a very painstaking job, it should have deserved many more Oscars. For example I think that Gladiator is more exciting than Ben Hur which got eleven Oscars. Then I was very much disappointed that a a master as Ridley Scott, one of the best directors of the world, didn't win the Oscar. It's unfair that masters as Alfred Hitchcock or Stanley Kubrik have never won an Oscar. Every time I watch again the film I always think that it should have been still more memorable with the participation of Marlon Brando, who should have been perfect for the spirit and the style of the film. He should have been an unforgettable old roman senator. As a matter of fact in my life I have never seen an actor so able to express power, intensity, passion, magnetism, charisma.

A visually stunning spectacle that thrives on its villain,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is a grand, sweeping epic that delivers on spectacle and storytelling, even if it takes liberties with history. At its core, the film thrives on a strong antagonist, a solid protagonist, and a narrative that keeps things engaging throughout its lengthy runtime.Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Commodus is one of the movie's standout elements. His performance makes him utterly detestable, which only enhances the emotional stakes-his every action fuels the audience's disdain, making the journey of Russell Crowe's Maximus all the more compelling. Crowe himself doesn't give an overwhelmingly stellar or flashy performance, but that might actually work in his favor. His reserved, stoic presence fits the character and allows the larger spectacle of the film to shine.The story moves through its twists and turns at a well-measured pace. Despite its extended runtime, Gladiator never feels like it drags, nor does it rush through its key moments. The action is visceral, the fights are intense, and the cinematography captures the grandeur of ancient Rome with stunning visuals. While historical accuracy isn't the film's strong suit, it never becomes a distraction-the sheer entertainment value outweighs any inaccuracies.Ultimately, Gladiator is an engaging historical epic that balances drama, action, and visual splendor. It may not be a perfect representation of history, but as a piece of cinematic storytelling, it delivers an intense and satisfying experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Extravagant full-fledged sword and sandal epic from filmmaking genius Ridley Scott takes on the scopic tale of a vengeance seeking Spanish general named Maximus (Crowe in a star-making turn) whose disposition from glorified soldier to slave to eponymous athlete in ancient Rome seeks to avenge the slaughter of his beloved family, his good name and ultimately self-redemption for the betrayal and murder of his mentor Marcus Auerelius (a haggard looking Harris) by his petulantly incestuous son Commoudus (hissably evil Phoenix) and dissuade his sister Lucilla (the divine Nielsen) from emotional imprisonment. Lavish set designs, bold visual effects (check out the Colosseum!), dark and stark cinematography by John Mathieson and Pietro Scalia's razor sharp editing particularly in the arena's carnage dripping bouts with effectively cringing moments of unbridled violence (including one bitchin' chariot fight) that honors its predecessors 'Ben-Hur' and 'Spartacus' well.

The olde style before substance,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is a film that is acted and directed very well, but is an eyesore to look at for two and a half hours. The film's effects are nice, which got the film an Oscar in 2000, and so are the costumes, but they are all captured in a dirty, muddy tone. Most of the film is a dingy colored brown, appearing as if someone imbedded dirty in the camera lens.The film's plot is just a revenge story, soaked within a period piece. It involves General Maximus Decimus Meridius (Crowe), the leader of the Roman Army in AD 180. Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Harris) is very pleased with his latest victory, and grants him leadership, much to the dismay of the Emperor's son, Commodus (Phoenix). It isn't long before Commodus is consumed with rage, and murders his father, claiming the throne as his.Commodus puts out an order to the Praetorian men to kill Maximus's wife and son. Before Maximus can return in time to stop them, they are killed. Being in a functioning state of depression, and after being kidnapped by slaves who teach him how to fight, Maximus finds out he has a knack for fighting and slaying people. So the plot is born. Maximus is a great gladiator, and continues to fight and murder, leading up to his appearance at the Roman Colosseum.I've established that the film is long, which it is, but it is also fairly impotent. It's slow, a bit dreary, yet well written in the sense that decent dialog is always recited. After a while, though, you begin to grow weary of the film's hushed tone, and about five battle scenes later, the material begins to overstay its welcome.The film is slowly paced, but it definitely has a grand appeal. Crowe's performance is fantastic, and he brings life to a new action hero. For the brief time we see him, Richard Harris does a fantastic Emperor, and Joaquin Phoenix does an outstanding job playing a despicable, intolerable villain.I also stated that the film's costumes are nice, which they are, but after two hours they become sort of a chore to stare at. Some nice CGI is used, some scenes made up entirely of it, yet again, everything looks the same. Everything is mostly brown, green, and black, and very monotonous and harmful on the eyes.Not to mention, no characters are really developed at all. The film is two and a half hours, and neglects to give us very many personal traits of the characters. This is the perfect case of style over substance; a movie trait I've run into far too much recently. To value style over substance is to put looks in front of every other concern, rather than efficiency and depth. John Logan, one of the three writers of this film, would give us so many character traits of Howard Hughes in The Aviator, four years later. It's a shame that wasn't put in the foreground rather than a loud score and heavy action sequences with this.Gladiator isn't perfect, but it's a fairly memorable action flick, with some ups and downs. To me, this seems like a long B movie, with marvelous special effects and well known actors. It's just a shame that in two and a half hours we have to listen to decent, yet sometimes, redundant dialog, trait-less characters, and stare into a vast field of brown. At least we get Oscar worthy performances to watch for the most part.Starring: Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, Derek Jacobi, Djimon Hounsou, Ralf M√∂ller, and Richard Harris.

This got an Oscar?,"I missed this on first release, but have watched it on DVD. To be quite honest, it's tripe of the first order. The script is awful, and the acting generally not much better (thank heavens for the computer-generated actors: they are at least the equal of their flesh-and-blood rivals). I found this film to be deeply contrived and boring. As for the garbage of the Emperor Commodus fighting 'mano a mano' with a gladiator, the scriptwriters must have been on something stronger than LSD.Presumably Ridley Scott hired Derek Jacobi for 'Gladiator' because he'd played a Roman before (to whit, Claudius, see below), but even in his minor role he out-acts the far starrier names (except for the late Oliver Reed, who steals every scene he's in).If you want a _real_ flavour of 'life at the top' in the Roman Empire, get the DVDs or videotapes of 'I, Claudius', the BBC's conflation of Robert Graves's 'I, Claudius' and 'Claudius the God'. This is far better written and it's superbly acted. It's also more convincing, despite being made on a shoestring budget.

A Timeless Epic,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is a cinematic masterpiece that transports audiences to the brutal world of ancient Rome. Russell Crowe delivers a powerful performance as Maximus Decimus Meridius, a loyal general betrayed by a power-hungry emperor. Forced into gladiatorial combat, Maximus rises to become a symbol of hope for the oppressed people. The film's breathtaking visuals, intense action sequences, and haunting score by Hans Zimmer create an immersive experience. While the plot may be familiar to those versed in historical epics, Gladiator's execution is undeniably captivating. It's a tale of revenge, redemption, and the enduring human spirit that continues to resonate with audiences today.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Had already watched it over times,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator (2000) is a film that stands as a monumental achievement in both the historical epic genre and the broader landscape of modern cinema. Combining stunning visuals, unforgettable performances, and an emotionally resonant narrative, Gladiator is a work of art that resonates deeply with audiences even years after its release. It's a film that skillfully balances action with profound character exploration, all while weaving together themes of justice, revenge, and personal redemption. More than just a historical spectacle, Gladiator is a cinematic masterpiece that has rightfully earned its place in the annals of film history.The technical aspects of Gladiator are equally impressive. Ridley Scott's direction is masterful, using sweeping shots of the Roman Empire alongside intimate moments of quiet reflection. The cinematography by John Mathieson captures the grandeur of the ancient world while never losing sight of the emotional depth of the characters. The film's iconic arena battles are choreographed with precision and intensity, yet the film never sacrifices character development for spectacle. Scott's use of lighting, particularly in the scenes set in the Colosseum, creates a sense of both awe and dread, making every fight not just a physical battle, but an emotional and spiritual one.Ultimately, Gladiator is more than just a film about a man seeking revenge. It's a meditation on the nature of power, legacy, and humanity itself. It asks profound questions about what it means to be free, to fight for what's right, and to reclaim one's dignity in the face of overwhelming adversity. It's a film that balances its epic scale with intimate, personal stakes, creating a powerful, emotional experience that lingers long after the credits roll.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

I'm terribly vexed.,"Best Picture?? Best.... Picture?? One more time: BEST PICTURE???If this thing wins best picture, I'm going to strip to the tunic and loincloth and protest outside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, and trust me, nobody wants that.I mean, have the nominators actually seen the movie? Since when does cheesey, intelligence insulting popcorn fodder like this disappointing movie win anything better than an award given out at the separate ceremony for technical achievement? The acadmeny has let me down before, no doubt about it. But at least the academy has always rewarded ""good"" movies, even when you felt a better movie was robbed. Forrest Gump shouldn't have beaten Pulp Fiction, but at least Forrest Gump was good. Same with Shakespeare in Love beating Saving Private Ryan, or Ordinary People beating Raging Bull. But if Gladiator wins, I think it will be the first time ever that a ""bad"" movie wins the top honor. I can't even recall a ""bad"" movie even getting nominated before.Let's not kid ourselves. Gladiator is a bad movie. I know the special effects were great, and you paid 8 bucks to see it... I know Gladiator does the whole action/violence/sword-swinging-epic thing better than a lot of its competition. And I know you've been saying it was a good movie all this time, so to make the admission that it was bad now would be to quietly admit that you've been watching a lot of bad movies and wasting a lot of money and time. But for God's sake DO IT. Admit it. You'll feel better.Normally I'd let this go. People watch it, they like it, what's the harm? A little mindless afternoon entertainment for a small fee. But when the industry leaders prepare to give this thing the top honors for the year, then we've got to take a stand. You need to find your nearest Academy voter, look him right in the inebriated bloodshot eye, and tell him that if he votes for this stupid movie, he deserves to be tied up and beaten with bamboo.I won't bother defending why I think it's stupid. All the reasons should be utterly apparent to anyone who's seen it.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Favourite Film,This has to be my favourite movie of all time. It's a classic. Russell Crowe's performance is out of this world and the award for best actor in that years Oscar was well deserved. He played the roll of a lifetime. What always fascinated me about going to watch this movie was I never watched one single trailer prior to going but was gripped from the beginning The other character's are also extremely strong and the storyline and pathway the film takes isn't something that hasn't seen before but certainly is moving and believable There isn't a great film without great music and Han Zimmer's score in this is arguably his greatest work. The theme and variations are so strong and the attention to detail of the style that was necessary for that period is fantastic. It's been 16 years since it came out and still has the same edge about it and that is the mark of a great film. You would happily watch it over and over.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"The script is saved by Crowe, Reed and the action scenes","Somewhere alone the way of writing this story each of the writers seemingly made each section more direct and clearer. Unfortunately, they ended up going way too far. The script doesn't have much, if any, subtext. There is a brutal directness in the writing that makes the film cheesy in its obviousness. Some of this might be intentional because story is very much one of blunt masculinity. Further, some the choices made in regards to the history are just laughably bad. No Rome did not become a republic again in 180 AD (or whatever). Commodus is made far to much of a coward as well. The script is very poorly executed through at least the board outlines of the story is quite good.But the movie is largely saved by Scott's direction. The story is a big dumb slice of blood sport and machismo; the visuals know this and lean into these aspects. Scott directions the actions scenes withe glee. The MTV style editing is recognizably early 2000's but it works extremely well in this film. Likewise, the less pristine and grimier visuals really fit Rome as a symbol of corruption. This is probably the best movie that could have been rung out of the script.Scott is greatly aided by Crowe, Reed and Phoenix. While all are a bit too pitched to be truly great, each of them turn in electrifying performances that patch up the script. Crowe gets emotion from the cheesiest and cliche lines. Phoenix manages to make a flat villain feel much more rounded (especially in the extended cut) and human. But Reed is absolutely the standout. Proximo is THE lovable rogue of the 2000's. Reed gives a performance of such glee and relish that he really helps you embrace the weaknesses of the script as charms.Should never have been in the Best Picture race but this film has aged well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Overhyped movie, entertaining but mostly fiction","Many critics blasted this film yet Hollywood fell in love it. Because of the critics I did not watch it until it was shown on HBO. I was appalled with its historical inaccuracy.Basically, Russell Crowe plays the role of a General in the Roman Army under the Roman Emperor Ceaser Marcus Aurelius, who many historians consider as one of the greatest Roman emperors. Marcus died while in Germany in 180 AD. His son, Commodus became the full emperor and made peace with the Germans.It is at this point that the movie departs from history. In the movie, just befor Marcus Aurelius died he was going to appoint his successor. The fact is that he appointed Commodus co-emperor in 177 AD, three years before he died.The movie makes the point that Marcus Aurelius had no confidence that his son was suitable to be emperor. That much is true and the movie asserts that he tried to appoint someone else to succeed him. That is untrue. If he considered Commodus unfit to rule, why did he make him co-ruler? Because if he hadn't, under Roman custom, his son had to die if he was not made the successor.The story gets more bizarre as it goes on. Russell Crowe escapes execution by Commodus and his family is slain by Commodus, who does not know that Crowe is not dead. As cruel as Commodus is, it is unlikely he would have killed the family of Crowe. It would have served no purpose. In the process Crowe becomes a slave gladiator and winds up in Rome fighting as a gladiator before Commodus. So highly unlikely.I won't give you the ending but it is pure fiction. However, I will tell you what really happened. In 182 Commodus' sister Lucilla conspired with a group of senators to assassinate him. The plot failed, and Commodus retaliated by executing a number of leading senators. Thereafter, his rule became increasingly arbitrary and vicious. In 186 he had his chief minister executed in order to appease the army; three years later he allowed the minister's successor to be killed by a rioting crowd. Political influence then passed to the emperor's mistress and two advisers.Meanwhile, Commodus was lapsing into insanity. He gave Rome a new name, Colonia Commodiana (Colony of Commodus), and imagined that he was the god Hercules, entering the arena to fight as a gladiator or to kill lions with bow and arrow. Finally, when Commodus announced that he would assume the consulship on Jan. 1, 193, dressed as a gladiator, the public became incensed. On Dec. 31, 192, his advisers had him strangled by a champion wrestler.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Gladiator the review,"Told from the eyes of a well-known general Maximus Decimus Meridius the story is set in ancient Rome. The main character is betrayed by the jealous son of the Emperor, who kills his whole family. Trying to save them Maximus gets imprisoned by slave owners. But he doesn't give up. Becoming a successful gladiator who denies the new Emperor, he is planning to rise up and take revenge for his family.The movie manages to immerse the viewer in the atmosphere of ancient Rome thanks to beautiful decorations and impressive acting. The film starts with a scene of war. It shows the weapons, military clothing and strategy of the time period. The most breathtaking part of the movie are games in honour of the emperor. They are taking place in the Colosseum, which made everything even more credible. The fights really give the viewer an insight of how the games were held.It is hard to say what the directors could have done to make Gladiator a better viewing experience. Yes, the story is quite predictable. And the idea of a hero taking revenge is hardly original. However, the story still succeds in making the viewer engaged. The music and actors are stunning.

A character based revenge epic whose grandiosity and style help to elevate a very simple revenge story that sometimes dives into melodrama,"Set in 180 AD, Spaniard Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius (Russell Crowe) is a revered and respected hero of Rome who has led the army to a successful conquest of Germania and now seeks a life of peace with his wife and son in the country. Maximus is summoned by emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) who is not long for this world and has reflected on Rome's conquest of the world with regret. Marcus embraces Maximus as the son he should have had and asks him to succeed him and give power back to the Senate and the people as he does not believe his son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) should lead Rome. When Commodus learns of his father's intentions, he kills him in order to ascend to power claiming he died of natural causes. When Maximus refuses to align himself with Commodus he is betrayed by the Praetorian Guard who kill his family and attempt to kill him. Circumstances see Maximus end up in slavery where he becomes a Gladiator and soon uses the love of the crowd as a means of getting revenge on Commodus.Gladiator is a 2000 sword and sandal epic from director Ridley Scott that is credited with helping to revive the largely dormant genre for the modern era thanks to usage of modern technology and film making that didn't required the ""cast of thousands"" of older films of its ilk. David Franzoni had been inspired to write a story about gladiators during the 70s when he rode his motorcycle through Italy and was captivated by the historical arenas adorning the country and following Dreamworks' positive reception to Amistad, Franzoni was signed to a multi-picture deal with his gladiator project commissioned for development. Ridley Scott was brought on board to direct the film with the producers showing him the painting Pollice Verso in order to convey the feel of the movie they wanted to make with Scott so captivated by the image he agreed to direct without even knowing the story. The script went through numerous revisions from various writers, producers, and even actors with lines such as ""Strength and Honor"" coming from a reworking of Crowe's high school latin motto or Phoenix ad-libbing the line ""Am I not merciful?"". While Gladiator doesn't hit the aspiration highs of the best of the genre like Ben-Hur or Spartacus, there's an undeniable charm to Gladiator's grandiose portrayal of an epic revenge story against a brutal tyrant.From the opening siege featuring the Roman Army's battle against the tribes of Germania Scott certainly knows how to stage a grand and exciting battle sequence. The staging for the battle sequences are incredibly well staged and also are nicely brutal and bloody with a real feeling of impact. In terms of characters, Russell Crowe is very good as Maximus who is a humble soldier despite the respect and prestige his position affords him and has no greater aspirations than returning to his family. Crowe's performance is complemented by Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus who doesn't so much chew the scene as he does devour by creating a gleefully over-the-top loathsome villain with the subtlety of a sledgehammer through glass. The most nuanced performances come from the supporting cast like Connie Nielsen as Lucilla who is Commodus' sister and a former lover of Maximus and becomes stuck between Commodus' ambition, Maximus' vengeance, and the machinations of the senate in realizing Emperor Marcus Aurelius' dream of Rome. Derek Jacobi also adds some gravitas as Lucilla's ally Senator Gracchus (who's no stranger to Roman epics given his association with I, Claudius), and Djimon Honsou and Ralf Moller are quite good as Maximus' gladiator allies Juba and Hagen. Gladiator is a very simple story with very expensive production design that creates an engaging experience, although I wouldn't say it's a classic in the vein of Ben Hur or Spartacus and it's more like a high budget/high polish version of those 60s Italian productions that tried to ape the style and craft of old Hollywood epics but with a more over the top style and delivery.Gladiator is a very fun revenge epic with a strong cast and well-realized scope and scale that helped to revitalize the long dormant sword-and-sandal genre. While I don't necessarily think it's Best Picture material, I do enjoy the pageantry, craft, and skill that's clearly on display and creates an engaging experience in spite of a very simple and familiar story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Destined to be a classic,"Gladiator is an underrated movie to say the least.

Probably the best war movie of all time,"Ridley Scott's magnum opus is a specter of epic proportions- both in terms of visual treat and acting prowess. Crowe gives his best ever performance, and is the perfect portrayal of a leader- calmness in eyes during planning, intend while attacking and ruthlessness in killing, and a man who lost his family- haunted by memories of his wife and son. Joaquin gives a stirring performance as Commodus. The subtle hinds of mental insanity, raw lust and incest adds to his mysterious nature, with the hatred to him increasing steadily through the movie. Connie Nielsen as Lucilla gives a steady performance, but the portrayal of her fear of Commodus is outstanding. The emotional scenes- between Aurelius and Maximus, Maximus' first battle as a gladiator and the climax sequences- could have been overdone by glorification of the hero, but Scott does an immaculate job in creating the feeling in audience, probably by the portrayal of Maximus as any man, driven solely by his loyalty and purpose above desire.Music by Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard is instrumental in completing the feel of Roman era, with the final ""Now we are free"" being absolute goosebumps material, though on hindsight, I did find some similarity between the Pirates of Caribbean ""He's a pirate"" and the war theme.Nevertheless, I don't find any reason why it should not be given a 10.

Words cannot do this movie justice,"I went to see Gladiator fully expecting to be completely bored out of my mind. Instead I came out of the movie with a new all-time favorite. I can't decide where to start on what I liked most. The acting was absolutely brilliant. I have a great amount of respect for Russell Crowe now, due to the strength and compassion he put into this film. However, I feel that Joaquin Phoenix did the best job in acting. He took a character that could have been one huge cliche, and turned him into a sadistic and cruel villian that you actually had a reason to despise.This preformance alone has turned me into a huge fan. All people involved in this film are deserving of any awards they might receive. The manner in which the film was shot was breath-taking. From Germanian forests to Rome, the scenery in this film is amazing. I am also a huge fan of the soundtrack. Rarely has a soundtrack nearly brought me to tears, but this one does almost any time I hear it. Listening to it alone brings back emotions that I've never felt listening to a soundtrack. It's about time that there is a film out there now that makes you want to cheer for the hero, hiss at the villian and see the movie over and over again. Hopefully Hollywood will follow suit with more films like this in the near future.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

A Masterpiece - Perfection,"I wont give spoilers but having revisited this film prior to the new Gladiator 2 I was reminded how in awe i am still at this films magnificence. The storytelling, the incredible acting from all, the effects and music. For me it has to be my favourite film of all time. A difficult watch at times but this is a film that has stayed with me since its release in 2000, in a positive way. The notion of honour, legacy and living for a cause bigger than yourself. The performance of Phoenix and Crowe have to be their all time best, including that of the former in Joker.

How can you not be entertained?!,"Ridley Scott's sword-and-sandal epic is the catalyst that led to a majority of modern men's obsession with the Roman Empire.

Joaquin Phoenix matches Crowe's excellence, playing the villainous foil, Commodus, a role that would launch him into stardom as well.

Best movie this summer,"I don't know why everyone is ragging on the plot; even though it was predictable at times, it was still gripping. I think this is the best movie I've watched the whole year; the visuals are just breathtaking. I haven't seen such beautiful cinematography since What Dreams May Come. George Lucas should ask Ridley Scott for some tips because while the special effects in Gladiator were less flashy, I believed it was real. Compare the computer graphics of the cityscapes of Rome to those in (whatever that city was called) in Phantom Menace. Same technical quality, but the stuff in Gladiator was a work of art. My only disappointment was the first battle scene. . . if I had watched the whole scene without turning away, I would have puked. Am I supposed to feel a rush just because they're pulling the film faster? The opening scene in Saving Private Ryan was by far superior. That had me ducking and wincing, Gladiator's did not. The acting was a bit cliche, on Russell Crowe's and Joaquin Phoenix's part, but so were their characters. I have to say though, I've never seen a better performance by Phoenix. In the scene where he kills his father, when he was giving that little speech about not being loved, I was moved to tears. That has got to be the most emotional scene in the whole movie . . . and a job well-done by Phoenix. Does anyone remember James Dean in East of Eden? Same speech, equally powerful. I wonder if that's where Phoenix got his inspiration. Overall, great movie. Too bad some people are anti-hype, anti-mainstream, because this film is really worthy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
CGI Overkill,"First of all, the CGI is terrible and mostly gratuitous. I don't see why the director couldn't shoot some REAL natural landscapes for Crowe's psychedelic flashbacks. As for Rome, it was all obviously fake, computer generated crap. Not a single sparkle of authenticity. I won't deny the utility of special effects, but I can't be alone on this one. CGI has cheapened the epic by inserting flat digital figures where beautifully three-dimensional human extras once stood, and by creating green-screen worlds that never have the depth of real locations. Watch ¬ÑLawrence of Arabia"" for example and you'll feel the difference. What a sad irony that a film made 40 years prior to ¬ÑGadiator"" gives class to contemporary cinema...Secondly, the action was excessively violent. I won't even discuss the historical accuracy. The only bright spots are Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix, both over-the-top in a pretty entertaining way. Russell's presence is overwhelming thanks to a spectacular physique and charisma... but not even his amazing acting skills can't save this movie. The music by Lisa Gerrard wasn't necessarily bad, but redundant when applied to (over)emotional scenes. That's the way to manipulate crowds: play the violins and let the blood/tears flood the screens. By the way, Gerrard's music was infinitely better and more properly used in ""The Insider"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Now We Are Free,"An exhilarating, sweeping epic that begs to be seen on the largest possible screen. Although it lacks emotional depth and sweep , it still delivers the type of rousing, large-scale adventure that marked the best films of its kind - say, Spartacus. The heroism and the epic grandeur leave behind the flavour of cynicism. They epitomize the kind of high-profile bloodshed the masses now expect. The script is serviceable but not exactly inspired. Filled with brilliant filmmaking and outstanding performances, but it's neither profound nor philosophical to become am absolute masterpiece -- it's mournful, serious, beautiful and, finally, loud, obnoxious, but hardly the soaring tale of one man's struggle that it clearly envisioned to be.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Old fashioned in 2000, even more so in 2023","I'm not sure what happened in the 23 years since I first saw this in the year 2000, but this was a film that I don't recall being anything but entertaining and watching it now I wasn't sure I could get through it I found much of it so boring. Historically, it's a bit comical in its inaccuracies, but most films of this ilk usually are. Someone on here mentions that it's like the best epics of the 1960s. Problem is most of those were not very good and have aged as badly as this has. Bloated, unrealistic and too long. Actually it's two and a half hour length seems much longer than that. Russell Crowe won an Oscar for this and it's a great powerful, physical performance and he's always good here, but if they wanted to give him an Oscar for best acting they should have waited one year for A Beautiful Mind. The rest of the cast is fine especially Joaquin Phoenix and Djimon Hounsou. No doubt there are some brilliantly staged sequences that are truly exciting and well staged, but in between is just some really boring dialog stretched thin with a somewhat ridiculous finale. I'm not sure if this is a case of my tastes just changing or this aging badly, but my best guess is it's some combination of both. Like that other reviewer stated, it is sadly like a 1960s epic. If those are your thing, then this should be too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Disappointing to the maximus!,"This film is stunningly bad.Russell Crowe is so wasted here.  And Connie Neilsen could be beautiful so much more entertainingly somewhere else.The sound is muddy, the effects attempt what they can't deliver, and the script is so relentlessly incredible that not even Crowe's acting and Neilsen's astonishing good looks can rescue it.The initial battle scene, like so many, is ridiculous.  The opposing forces are cheaply miniscule.  The Romans chose laughably bad ground (downhill from the enemy!).  And the ease with which the Romans position there cavalry behind the opponents is absurd.  It was nice, if incomprehensible, to catch Scott's homage to the great film, ZULU -- the Germans seemed to have the Zulu battle chants down pat.Most annoyingly, Scott seems to think that an occasional spray of blood and a sickeningly jostled camera equals Big Action.  More like Mild Nausea.  We see much of this, alas, later in the movie, too.OK, so we grant a little geographic and medical license to Maximus as he rides, wounded, across much of Europe, to find his family murdered.  But from that moment all credulity must be withheld.  Since when does a Roman citizen place himself in jeopardy of being impressed by slave traders just because he makes the grave error of being unconscious?  It might have made more sense if he'd woken up belowdecks on a British ship of the line in the 18th century.The climax of the film, though momentarily pleasing in the accuracy of its downbeat rendition of one's chance of succeeding in a plot against a Roman emperor, once again dismisses credibility: Commodus thinks he'll do better against a genuine heavyweight than Johnny Friendly did against Terry Malloy. Or imagine Al Gore suggesting that he and George Dubyah settle this thing mano a mano.  Same idea.  Puh-lease.The film was kind of a pagan BEN HUR, but without Jesus, the horses, the (real) crowds, and any significance whatever.  And it lacked, especially, a crazy emperor like Caligula of the ROBE movies, played in his film debut by the brilliant Jay Robinson (""Messalina!""). Too much post-modern dysfunctional family stuff among Scott's Caesars.Yuck.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

A mondern day Classic!,"One word, phenomenal! The motif of this film takes its viewers back in time to the days of old, when Rome was the greatest empire on earth. Russel Crow plays the fictional character Maximus Decimus, he was a mighty man a valor, a man who was held in high esteem by the Roman emperor, Marcus Aurelius played by Richard Harris. Although Maximus was a man of good character and integrity, he was at odds with the emperor's son Commodus, played by Joaquin Phoenix. Commodus envied Maximus because of the high regard father had for Maximus, sharing a father and son line relationship that Commodus envied. Commodus wrongly inherited the Roman throne at the demise of his late father, Marcus Aurelius. This film captivates you from the start, showing off the subtle beauty and ambiance of Rome. From the country side, to the battlefield, this film gives its viewers a glimpse of what it was like during the reign of some of the worlds most powerful and affluent emperors. Director Ridley Scott, did an astonishing job as he was able to recreate an unforgettable experience, giving viewers front row seats to the battlefields and dynasties of the Roman empire around 180AD. The movie and its graphics were utterly breathtaking. Another part of the movie that captivated me was the battle scenes, where we got to see how the Roman gladiators fought, what weapons they used, the raiment they wore. It all added to the experience of being at the front lines of battle. Russell Crow did an astonishing job, playing his character Maximums. I mean, he was so into character, if you will, he was believable, you could feel his emotion and love for his family through the movie screen, and his fearless to avenge his family's wrongful death. To me, the film Gladiator reminds me of a combination of Braveheart and 300, both war movies that both have similar themes and storylines throughout the film. Overall this movie is great for just about anyone. Especially for those who share an interest with accent Rome, war and love. This film is full intense scenes that keep you engaged and enthralled throughout the film. From the intensifying battle scenes to the subtle radiance of the Roman corn fields.

It doesn't mirror reality and has so many flaws in the most very basic things it was 50% hard to watch, which is pretty bad for a movie. Joaquin Phoenix was absolutely brilliant playing the role and is the main reason I could bare watching. He made Commodus such a realistic character, at a certain point I actually felt bad for him. He's truly a great actor. I don't regret watching this movie, and I can't say it's TRULY bad, but honestly it's not a good movie either. Picture it like this. It's like 300. Absolutely disconnected from reality and made to impress certain demographics. I'd say this movie wants to be like Braveheart, to be a story of love and war, but fails miserably at delivering the same authentic experience.

Also the Emperor Commodus, played by Joaquin Phoenix, that part was well cast. But the two fine actors just cannot be reversed with the roles, can they? Of course not.The medium of movies requires tons of man-hours, equipment, then post-production, etc., all of this just to tell a story, entertain people for a very short time. Gladiator was that movie that utilized all available facilities and human potential to closely portray this tale of the Roman Empire circa 180 A.D. This movie really did not stray too far from reality as a lot of movies do, just for the entertainment value. We do know that the Coliseum existed, have historical accounts that closely resemble the living conditions and daily life of the people of 180 A.D.Gladiator has a moral center in which the main characters never waved from even when it could be expected to do so under such conditions.Maximus drove everything he had to accomplish what he did, against the insurmountable odds, and that makes a great story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

She seemed morally ambiguous and her claims of fearing her brother and being coerced into certain actions were only half-believable. She could be more opportunistic and manipulative than cowered and a victim of circumstance.

(This is in contrast to Ben-Hur, which is all spectacle.)

Are you not entertained!,"I remember watching pieces of this movie as a kid and in fact Gladiator (2000) was the movie that introduced me to legendary filmmaker Ridley Scott. In anticipation of Gladiator II (2024) coming out next month, I decided to finally watch Gladiator (2000) in its entirety from start to finish and after watching it, I completely understand why this movie is hailed as one of the greatest of all time.Positives for Gladiator (2000):
The story of this movie is epic in every way possible to where you have this man having to go through all of these obstacles so that ha can avenge the death of his father, wife and son against the emperor of Roman, that alone had my attention throughout the runtime. The production value and costume design for Ancient Rome is absolutely magnificent. It goes without saying that everyone on the cast gives phenomenal performances. Russell Crowe as Maximus Decimus Meridius is such a compelling and complex character that you can't help but root for in the movie and it's no surprise why Crowe won the Oscar for Best Actor. I can almost say the same for Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus except his character is very despicable with the actions he does in this movie. The same things can also be said about Connie Nielsen as Lucilla and Djimon Hounsou as Juba. The musical score by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard gives you all of the epic vibes and atmosphere that you would expect from a movie of this scope and magnitude. The action sequences and fight choreography are masterfully done to perfection by Ridley Scott. And finally, the ending of the movie manages to have the perfect balance of being poetic and tragic at the same time.Overall, Gladiator (2000) remains one of the greatest movies in the history of cinema 24 years later, it is my second favorite movie by Ridley Scott just behind Alien (1979) and I am so excited for Gladiator II (2024).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

For the Love of Rome! What a disappointment....,"Ridley Scott has made a real loser. The first third of the movie was tedious - the one battle at the beginning was so messy you couldn't tell what the hell was going on -- ok the horrors of war show that it's crazy and Ridley Scott was trying to make the viewer feel as disoriented as the film's hero -- guess what? It was done better in ""Saving Private Ryan"" and at least in that film you can SEE the fellow soldiers falling around the main character. One ripoff from a film. Also check out how close it comes to ""Braveheart"" in parts --- ""Say, William Wallace is visited by the young queen while in a cell in ""Braveheart"" and that was cool - let's have Maximus visted by the daughter of the king and conspire against her brother just like the young French Queen conspired against King Longshanks in ""Braveheart."" Plus in ""Braveheart"" there's cool battle scenes, let's try that too. Not to mention the obvious, Russell Crowe sure as hell sounds like Mel Gibson, the only difference is he is so miserable in this film and there is no real heroic character development like with Gibson. When his family is killed at the end of the first act, the moral is that Hollywood truism, ""behind every good man is a dead woman and/or child."" It does pick up after that though. The best part in the film was the 2nd act after he's picked up by Oliver Reed and thrown in as a Gladiator - but even here the battle scenes are too messy and you can't tell what the hell is going on - at one point a Legionaire is cut in half by what I thought was only a wooden stick on the chariot - I had to be explained that ""it must've been a blade"" by my companion who came with me to the film. Now that I think about it, we were asking each other what the hell was going on a number of times, mostly due to the jerky camera shots and the loud noises over whispered dialogue. And I never talk during a film. The ending was ludicrous the ""go home Maximus"" and the ""Lucius is safe"" dialogue made me roll my eyes. There was little to no historical value to the film and Rome was pretty damn boring - plus 5 shots of the same part of the ""majestic collosium"" only verified that it was a CGI-generated shot. Christ, even the CGI birds were splotches on the screen...Anyway, there are a few things that were ok - Reed and Crowe were pretty good. Phoenix was ok as the ""unloved by daddy"" emperor. The actress Connie Neilsen who played Lucilla was pretty good and well as Maximus' two ""buddy"" Gladiators. In short, a lousy script, well-acted but 2-dimensional characters, and messy camera shots made this only another film that disappointed me. A 6.5 out of 10 (D) --- Go watch any bit of ""Spartacus,"" two scenes from ""Braveheart,"" and the first 15 minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan.""

I like watching watching these types of movies that are based about the past and show you how people used to live.

A Guy's Night Out,"This is the guy's movie. No way around it. There's armies in combat, there's a father and son drama, there's gladiators (no duh, in a movie called Gladiator), there are women in skimpy outfits, and by the end, more violence. Not that any of this is bad. You just need to know what to expect when seeing this 2000 Oscar winner for best picture. Oscar winner Russel Crowe plays Maximus, a general in the Roman army who is next in line to be ruler of Rome, as the rightful Emperor-to-be Commodous (Joaquin Phoenix) is bypassed by Caeser Marcus Arillias (Richard Harris) in his final attempt to bring back to the old republic. After the Caesar's death, Commodous orders the execution of Maximus, which begins the epic portion of Gladiator. By the end of the movie, scores are settled, more battles are won, legacies are sealed, and every man in the audience has seen everything he could have wanted. No romance here, so the ladies will have to rely on seeing Russel Crowe running around without much clothes on. The best performance for my money is by the late Oliver Reed, who died while filming was in progress. Reed plays an emotionally unattached slave trader who trains Gladiators to fight in Rome. The movie looks good, for the most part. The computer generated Rome leaves something to be desired however, as the buildings look metallic and cold and some of the people watching the Gladiators are out of focus and not wearing togas.

I didn't really know much about Russell Crowe before this film but was so impressed with his range of emotions and I fell for him..The expressions of love for his duty to the ceasor..his family ..and his men..He is truly A great actor..

The best movie in years...FOR ME TO POOP ON,"Let me preface this by saying I'm a fan of most of Ridley Scott's work. Bladerunner is a terrific flick and Alien ain't too shabby, either.  Then I saw the trailers for Gladiator and some early reviews(almost exclusively raves) and got excited for a good, well-made film.  What I got was the most boring movie I've seen in a theater in quite some time.  Initially, I gave the film the benefit of the doubt...a lot of people liked this so it must get interesting sooner or later.  About 45 minutes into the film, however, I realized it wasn't going to get any better.  I first looked at my watch at that point and proceeded to do so at least every ten minutes thereafter.  I hoped the reel would catch fire and save me from watching the last hour but, alas, I had to watch until the end.  I probably would've left but I attended the film with my father and we hadn't been to a movie together since T2...what're ya gonna do?.Gladiator was lifeless and unoriginal.  The plot was shabby and often laughable, and I honestly believe the folks at MST3K could've had a pretty good time with it.  Much of the dialogue was cheesy, the camera work was largely uninspired and every time a computer generated 'roman' backdrop was on screen the characters amidst them were fuzzy and shadowy.  At other times Scott included footage to purposely sicken the audience, i.e. the ""snot"" scene.  Did anyone else find that as nasty as I?Another problem with this film as that, despite its epic running time, the plot progression is hasty and incomplete.  Maximus goes from general to slave in about 3 scenes(why is he a slave again?) and kills around 7 people as a gladiator before becoming the most popular man in Rome.  There's plenty of room for good development within two and a half hours.  Instead, Scott pushes Gladiator's sub-par progression only within the brief action scenes(the only interesting scenes in the entire movie...honestly) and offsets them with minutes upon minutes(hours?) of crap that doesn't go anywhere.  The raves this movie has received confuse me.    Gladiator is the most overrated movie in years.If you're looking for a good movie along the same lines, watch Conan the Barbarian.  Gladiator uses roughly the same story line, but Conan is about 3000 times more entertaining.  And don't get popcorn before you enter the theater.  Believe me, you'll welcome any excuse to get up and stretch your legs before the movie actually concludes.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Fine, I can deal with that. But shouldn't a film about Roman times at least attempt to make viewers feel like they're in ancient Rome? Instead, we've got what almost appears to be a video game about colliseum fighting, with rapid moving, computer-generated adversaries slashing about and losing their heads almost out of theatregoers' sights.

7 on a scale of 10,"I enjoyed this movie for the most part. I went with 4 others. Three of them, like me rated it as a B- or about a 7. One of them liked it considerably more. But, based only on a popularity contest, a 7 is low as per this site. I had several problems with the movie.1) It was WAY too long as so many movies are nowadays. It ran about 2:30. It wasn't that it was boring, it is just that it could EASILY have been 1/2 hour shorter and it would have been better. It bordered on dragging almost throughout. There were a few exciting scenes, but even they were too long. Minus 1 point.2) The fights were less than spectacular. I was very impressed with the sets, dress and scale. It was truly an epic in that sense. However, the fights were weak. Compared to Zorro and Matrix, the fight scenes in this movie were low tech. Minus 1 point.3) I'm not a particular fan of sword movies to begin with. I prefer modern movies as opposed to period pieces.

don't deserve the credit it got.,"When I saw the movie in the theater for the first time I said it was OK. Not a great movie but worth seeing. Of course this is mainly for the battles that are amazing. And the score to the movie is fair enough. But I had a feeling that there is something wrong with this movie. It seemed that this is a replica of Braveheart. Only in Braveheart I got emotional without wanting it and in Gladiator I wanted to but I couldn't, It just wasn't so.The next time I saw it on DVD I noticed that each time I waited for the fights, because everything else is dumb. The plot unveils in turtle pace, the dialogs are over dramatic, it just like all the characters will burst with tears in minute after they say something. The most annoying thing is the plot itself. The characters look very unrealistic and unconvincing, a lot of time is wasted on unnecessary talk and the end can be predicted from the beginning.Well, a little bit of history for the end. There was an Emperor Marcus Aurelius that was considered as a ""good"" emperor, that ended the era of ""the five good emperors"". His son that succeeded him was Commodus ( just like in the movie ), but he's not killed his father. Marcus Aurelius died from a disease. Commodus himself was an excellent fighter. He fought with his father in the north, and after he became an emperor he tested himself each time in the coliseum arena with the gladiators and the beasts, and won each and every battle. Commodus killed by an athlete called Narcissus in his bath. Commodus considered himself a god and wanted people to think of him the same which can be viewed as insanity but for sure he wasn't weak and Coward as he was portrayed in the movie. He also ruled for 12 years, something that the movie doesn't count for.One commercial movie for Ridley Scott, but definitely one of the dumbest he made ( there is always G.I.Jane for this title ).

"Breathtaking, entertaining and brilliant","Ridley Scott was drawn to direct this project by a painting entitled ""Thumbs down"", which depicted a scene (seen a few times in the film) where a gladiator is sentenced to death by the emperor. It is a moment of pure theatre and that is part of the cinematic appeal of the idea of Rome ‚Äì an idea which had for forty years or so been ignored. Scott's resulting vision was an epic which has been one of the most influential films of the decade.The story is epic in scope, but powerful in its detail. Maximus, general of the armies of the north, is favoured by the Emperor to become the protector of Rome. The Emperor's son, Commodus, kills his father before this happens and condemns Maximus to death. Maximus escapes execution and flees to his home where he finds his wife and child murdered. He is caught by slave traders and becomes a popular gladiator intent on revenge. The work on the script should not be underestimated as this is an effective story of a man trying to avenge his family and, on some level, get home.Maximus sees Russell Crowe in one of his finest performances. He brings charisma and magnetism to the screen which makes Maximus sympathetic and engaging for both genders: a proper, fully developed character and not just an action hero to be adored by teenage boys. Joaquin Phoenix was underrated as Commodus, bringing to bear insecurity and weakness with a terrifying edge, making him one of the greatest villains of recent years. Richard Harris's appearance is all too brief in this film but is memorable enough to be counted as his last great performance. Oliver Reed meets Crowe's performance stroke for stroke and is a great presence in this film (his performance became noted for being completed with the aid of CGI after his death toward the end of filming).Scott, however, is the real star of this film, making a world as rich and detailed as the one he created in ""Blade Runner"" and delivering a terrific story masterfully. The film looks stunning and has a fine Hans Zimmer score. Once again, the computer effects were another step forward (the Coliseum was largely created by visual effects) and have not dated much in nearly ten years.The film's influence cannot be denied (wheat is now a staple image of otherworldliness) and the decade that has followed has been stuffed with historical epics (""Troy"", ""Alexander"", ""300""), none of which have been as successful or as effective. Its claim to greatness however comes from its ability to satisfy those who had come for story and character and those who came for action and excitement. It is the ultimate blockbuster.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Welcome to Rome, again. Please keep off the grass and watch the games.","'Gladiator' is one hell of a film to behold. This is one demonstration of the powers and wonders of film making. The original that defined the modern sandals and swords. Some how its hard to imagine anyone else other than Russel Crow as Maximus. Even by the likes of Lord of the Rings, the visuals; the story; and the characters hold together. Yeah, it's not perfect (loads of goofs to find if you like ruining films) but what we are still given is a movie that is nothing else than pure drama. To hell with the anachronisms. By the time the movie is over, you'll have forgotten all about the fact you could see the gas cylinder in the back of the chariot. For 2 1/2 hours, believe you are in Rome. Believe you are sat in the ampitheatres watching blood games. I think 'Gladiator' is well worth its experiences. And i will admit. 'Gladiator' is the only film where the ending brings a tear to the eye every time. Troy might be a wooden horse and that other Roman movie, King Arthur might be stuck on the wall.

Flawed and over-confident in its supposed 'genius',"Gladiator is a film which contrives to be something more than just another 'no-brain actioner' but unfortunately the film tries too hard to be unique and simply wallows in its own pretensions and clich√©d dialogue, delivered by unconvincing cardboard cut outs of characters.The plot,in short, revolves around Maximus(Russell Crowe) a talented Roman general who, after winning a huge battle at Germania,is privately chosen by the Emperor(Richard Harris) to be the next ruler of Rome. Commodus, the Emporer's son is informed of this and does not take the news well and swiftly reasserts his right to the throne by .....well I think the rest is already covered quite sufficiently in the 'Plot Summary' section, so I'll begin criticizing this bloated piece of historical nonsense.Ridley Scott is famed for his distinctive visual flair, and Gladiator is another impressive piece of style over substance, as Scott lavishly recreates imperial Rome with the aid of some imppressive computer graphics and superbly choreographs the elaborate battle sequences with brutal attention to detail. However once you get past these superficial details you discover the glaring faults that prevent the film from being as good as it should have been. Crowe's maximus is a fairly 2-dimensional character and his facial expressions seem to be limited to either scowling, suppressing rage, or just generally moody, whilst his dialogue consists of 'uber-hero' clich√©s all delivered in a typically macho, gruff voice lacking any inflection or emotion. Crowe can be a very good and versatile actor but he flounders in this role, remaining in dull monotone for most of the picture.The Film is partially redeemed by solid performances from Connie Nielsen as the tragic, but strong-willed, heroine and Joaqiun Phoenix completely camps it up as the vile Commodus to great effect and Derek Jacobi is impressive in a small role as a member of the Roman Senate.Many people love this film but I don't consider it to be particulairly special (maybe I'm too demanding) so I reccomend you check it out for yourself, but the fact this film won the 'best picture' oscar proves very little and only demeans the academy's already waning credibility.For now I'll give the film a mediocre score of 6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Ridley Scott's defining masterpiece,"Gladiator is the prime example of filmmaking at its best: massive set pieces, honest acting, and a plot to back up the gravity of the scenes. Moving from the forests of Germany and the fighting pits of Zucchabar, before culminating in the Colosseum of Rome, Scott's historical epic flows seamlessly. Russell Crowe gives an Oscar-worthy performance as the grizzled but vengeful Maximus, plotting a course back to the Emperor Commodus (equally brilliantly played by Joaquin Phoenix). The fighting pits emulate the unrest within the capital, as discord grows between the emperor and the Senate.Fighting scenes are appropriately epic: realistic imagery and brutal military style are on full show, accentuated by the devotion paid to the costume design of the film. Hans Zimmer is, as usual, perfect in scoring the film, adding both a solemness to darker scenes, whilst capturing the heat of battle when required. The fine acting is merely the icing on the cake. Not a wrong step is taken, from the leads down to the more minor roles (a personal favourite is Djimon Hounsou as Maximus' gladiatorial ally Juba).Gladiator comes together perfectly in all facets of film - there is a perfectly good reason this is such a highly acclaimed film, and for all the right reasons.

An overrated mess.,"Aside from Russell Crowe's strong performance, GLADIATOR is a chaotic mess. The editing is jumbled and confused, especially in the Arena scenes. To say this confusion is ""realistic"" is absurd, since when facing an opponent in the Arena, the most important thing is to remain clearheaded and outmaneuver him if you are to win. The celebrated battle in the forest in the beginning is just a silly attempt to ape the D-Day segment in the similarly overrated SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. As for the supporting performances, the best that can be said is that Richard Harris is dour and Oliver Reed is enjoyably hammy. Joaquin Phoenix is never convincing for a moment as the emperor. His performance would be more at home in a modern high school pageant. The photography resembles a European perfume commercial more than an evocation of ancient times. I wasn't aware the only color available in Rome was gold. For a truly excellent version of the same story, check out Anthony Mann's superb 1964 FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. While both films are based on the same historical characters, GLADIATOR shamelessly ""borrows"" many plot points from the earlier film, to less effect. Russell Crowe's supporting cast cannot hope to compete with such classic actors as Alec Guiness, Christopher Plummer, James Mason and Sophia Loren in FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. It would also be pointless to compare the directorial style of Anthony Mann, who is without a doubt one of the great American filmmakers of the 50s and 60s, with that of Ridley Scott, who directs like he's making a commercial for GLADIATOR perfume or a music video for a band dressed as ancient Romans. Just compare the finale man to man combat in the Arena in Scott's film with the same scene in Mann's. No comparison.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Are you not entertained?,"Few films deserve the title 'Masterpiece'. Being able to capture the emotional impact, dramatic force and all around power of what we would consider a masterpiece is simply beyond most films that make their ways to the cinema these days. I think it's fair to say the Gladiator is one of the very few films that does not fall short of expectations. Instead, it easily surmounts them, drawing the viewer in, and forcing out of them every possible emotion by it's sheer power. We can't help but cheer when Maximus strikes down yet another foe in the arena, we can't help but boo and groan with malcontent as the purely evil Commodus (there's no other way to put it) plans his next scheme. Gladiator manipulates our emotions in a way that is fantastic to behold - Hans Zimmer's beautiful and majestic score keeps the mood flowing, and the simple story is brought up by the sheer scope of the production and the incredible performances driving the film.It's been said so many times by now, but Russell Crowe is nothing less than magnificent, easily deserving his Academy Award for his performance. His stunning performance drives the film, and keeps the audience engaged throughout - never once can we take our eyes off him, or be drawn out of the incredible story he draws us into.Joaquin Phoenix, playing Maximus' nemesis, the scheming Commodus, is stunning. The sheer evil he exudes must be applauded, as his paranoid, arrogant, power-hungry dictator is slowly but steadily forced out of the favor of the people by Maximus is breathtaking. We develop a genuine hatred for Commodus, and openly cheer whenever Maximus wins public favor over him. Few villains have matched Phoenix's ability to be genuinely vile to the core.Connie Nielson is also terrific as Commodus' strong-willed but fearful sister, living in a web of apprehension once her brother takes power over Rome. Oliver Reed, sadly in his last performance, is great as Proximo, the slave dealer, who as Maximus puts it, is ""in danger of becoming a good man"". Djimon Hounsou is wonderful as Maximus' loyal fellow slave and gladiator, and Richard Harris is a strong presence as Marcus Aurelius, the previous emperor of Rome, slain by Commodus' murderous ambition.I am hard pressed to find any flaw with Gladiator. It excels in every possible area - wonderful set and costume design, a superb musical score, top notch performances, and an overall sense of power which cannot help but draw you in, and let the viewer witness the majesty firsthand.

Not one of Ridley's best,"If you don't like this film after the first half hour you'd better leave and save yourself another hour or two - it goes on & on and doesn't improve with age. This is an epic with no heart and soul - lots of oh-so-evil bad guys and goody-two-shoes, sweetness & light nice guys. You don't feel much for anyone in it, unlike other modern 'epics' like Braveheart, and computerized SFX or not, it can't hold a candle to the likes of Ben Hur/Spartacus etc. In fact, even the effects are not really all that impressive - and if the acting and script had been better I probably wouldn't have noticed, but I had so much time on my hands that I started trying to guess where the 'real' actors and sets stopped and the 'virtual' ones started. It's not quite like Titanic - the effects are not so impressive, and the acting is nowhere near as awful - but it does unfortunately come to mind. Still, at least go & see it in a decent theatre, it will shrivel away to nothing on the small screen.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Now Thats what I call Screen Magic !,"I used to mumble ""Afterlife' a Joke"" till Gladiator happened. Now I start to wonder if my actions will in fact echo in my Afterlife ! Set in Ancient Rome, The Gladiator is everything spectacular that you can imagine about a movie of such epic proportions. Breathtaking visuals of the amphitheaters and of Rome itself will segue you into an ancient Roman realm. The grandeur of the ""games"" will just etch itself in your mind. And the afterlife concept and its depiction was really mind-blowing.USP 1: Dialogue! The Dialogue is everything that can be. It is Awe-Inspiring. It is Heart-Rending. It sends your Pulse-Racing and your hackles springing. I have watched this movie a zillion times now and have memorized every bit of verbal legerdemain that it has to offer. It is clearly exemplary in buttressing the already superior climaxes.USP 2: Russel Crowe - Welcoming you into a cesarean time , is a stubbled Russel Crowe breathtakingly wielding his sword first in battle as a reputed general ,then in the amphitheater as a slave and finally in the Collosuem as the Gladiator. Although the entire cast have a splendid acting performance, Crowe in particular is terrific. Makes it all the more challenging, as his character traverses a wide variety of emotions and situations. He also command a certain air of unnerving chivalry throughout the movie. His English accent goes really well with the movie and its resounding dialog.USP 3 : Hans Zimmer - Soundtrack! Hmm! How many times has it resonated in my ears ! Its brings the Afterlife to ...well ...life. It sets a super cadence to which you would pound your feat , drool your way through Elysiums and colloseums , enliven your emotions and indulge your senses. You could rerun the entire movie in your head with the soundtrack alone ! The sound track for the most part has a tinge of ""Gregorian"" and fittingly so too.USP 4 : Cinematography and Special Effects - Cinematography and Special effects are so outstanding, that without the aforementioned USP's the Colosseum scenes would have comprehensively eclipsed the rest of the movie. And the Academy certainly didn't disagree either. Of particular significance, is the portrayal of Afterlife which although is a complete human conception , tends to inculcate into the movie a sense of mysticism. This is exactly where the Cinematography is a huge success.It was really pleasing to witness ""The Gladiator"" make all the big snatches at the Academy Awards even against such stern competition as ""Traffic"" and ""Erin Brokovich"". The Gladiator doesn't fall short to make it to the established pedestals of movie making on any front. All in all, a ""Screen Magic""!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Gladiator shmadiator,"I did not enjoy this movie very much, I thought that it was a good way for dreamworks to make a quick buck or in this case a quick 200 million bucks. I am saddened that Russel Crowe won his oscar for this movie, as opposed to his excellent ACTING in The Insider. Crowe was great in The Insider because that film showed that he can ACT in many different situations, as opposed to him showing how he can try to get revenge. I think that this will be remembered as a great action movie. This was a good movie because it was grand and it was big and flashy, however some of the other movies that were released in the year 2000 were good movies, because they had meaning, substance, and they were powerful films. These movies were good for reasons other than their special effects and their director and stars. I did not enjoy this movie because I was disturbed that this film won best picture as opposed to Requiem For A Dream, which was a powerful and groundbreaking film. I do not think it was the best picture of the year, no offense to anyone involved with this film, but.. that is my opinion.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Epic struggle,"Ridley Scott film Gladiator (2000), reputedly inspired by a painting, is set in ancient Rome at the time of Caesars (approximately 100-50 B.C.). Leaders of a republican empire that spread across the whole of Europe, most of the Middle East and North Africa, we join their premier General Maximus (Russel Crowe) on the battlefield immediately prior to their invasion of Germany.Caesar himself (Richard Harris) is in old age. He is wondering whether this great empire he has conquered has been worth the sacrifices he has had to make to secure it.It is not long before he finds out. His aptly named and disaffected son Commodos (Joaquim Phoenix) is soon hell-bent on winning control of all that his absent father has won. His unwilling sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) and nephew Lucius (Spencer Treat Clark) are drawn into a succession of outrageous betrayals which they feel helpless to avoid.Loyal Maximus, meanwhile, suffers the loss of his family and barely escapes with his life. Tended to by Juba (Diimon Hounsou) and exiled, of necessity, to a remote part of the Empire - he rebuilds his shattered life championed by the unlikely promoter Proximo (Oliver Reed).No longer the leader of a legitimate army, Maximus makes his name as a prize-fighter or Gladiator. Even in the time of ancient Rome, such a fighter could win his freedom from slavery by open competition in the public arena.Returning to Rome as a self-made champion, Maximus is soon recognised by long-serving members of the Senate like Graccus (Derek Jacobi) with whom he conspires to free Rome from the tyrannous hold that Commodos has gained by deceit.A powerful tale, well told and full of the dark uncertainty that attends such great events.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

""" When Death stares at you and smiles, all you can do is smile back""","If one is ever asked to select a film which truly measures up to action, drama and historically accuracy, "" Gladiator "" is the first on that list. Movie audiences have long awaited a film which mixes history and action in such a way that it becomes memorable. Ridley Scott has become a true artist in his conception of action films. To date, few films have become so notable as this rendition of the last years of the Emperorer Marcus Aurelius( Richard Harris) on the Rhine. In this story we have a veteran Roman General (Russell Crowe) Maximus Meridius who having won yet another victory over the Germanic tribes, wishes nothing more than to go home and tend his crops. he asks his emperor for permission to go home, but before the wish is granted, he dies and his son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) becomes the new ruler. Fearing the popular general is a threat to him, he orders him killed. Oliver Reed (In his last film) plays Proximo, an owner of slaves and gladiators saves him and offers him a chance for revenge. Derek Jacobi plays Gracchus who lends a splendid dignity to the film. Spencer Treat Clark is Lucius who finds the Spanish Gladiator admirable, courageous and interesting. Throughout the movies, one cannot but enjoy the settings, the costumes and the various sub-topics which make for drama at it's best. Highly recommended, this film is sure to become a Classic. ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Gladiator: ""Are You Not Entertained?"" - Yes!","Russell Crowe rightly earned an Oscar for his performance in this movie.
Joaquin Phoenix played the part of a jealous, cowardly Emperor perfectly.There are thousands of 'Reviews' on IMDB about Gladiator, so I'd like to
add a personal anecdote or two; in the first ten minutes or so there is a final battle between the might of the Roman Army and the ""Huns"" (German Tribes.)
This was the Battle of Teutenberg Forest and it was shot in a farmers field, called Bourne Woods - about two miles from where I used to live.Seems that when the producers approached the UK's Forrestry Commission for
permission to (literally) burn down the forest on the land, they were given
permission as the forest was due to be uprooted anyway. So the Commission
was happy for the movie makers to do the work for them. Amazing.Oliver Reed (RIP) was someone who used to frequent a local pub, and he would
tell tall tales to keep everyone ""entertained"" - his drinking was legendary.This movie, IMO, paved the way for others to follow: ""sword and sandals"", such
as Centurion, The Eagle, etc. and will be difficult if not impossible to beat.Another Scott helmed movie is The Kingdom of Heaven with Orlando Bloom and Eva Green. If you loved Gladiator, check this one out also.Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" - entertainment par excellence. 10/10. Easily.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Incredible historical drama,"Despite a few obvious filmmaking errors, Gladiator is still an incredible historical drama that's epic and emotional. Russell Crowe gives an incredible lead performance and Joaquin Phoenix, Djimon Hounsou, Connie Nelson and Oliver Reed are all great. Ridley Scott's direction is great, it's extremely well filmed and well paced. The production values are consistently extremely impressive and the music by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard is incredibly epic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The power of vision,"Here the interesting thing worth commenting is vision. It's otherwise a typical film of its sort if several years more later it appears to have not been particularly prescient of the wonderful advances we've had since in the way of telling a story.Its' a reworking of Fall of the Roman Empire, an amazingly clunky epic from the 60s around the same story that signaled the end of its type; in its narrative trajectory this is as stale now. The hero and villain, the conflict, the rising above circumstances and poetic redemption. The stage is of course far more dynamic, it's overall closer to the eye but frames the same one dimension.Kingdom of Heaven was more evocative for me; there we started by following an ordinary man swept to a far and mysterious historic horizon, the journey was to a place where destiny threatened to reveal itself, though the film otherwise partook of many of the same faults as this, the blacksmith became the hero, the tentative horizon became the painting of brave exploits.The nested story here is about the power of vision.It's the vision Commodus creates to manipulate a mob addicted to empty spectacle, the gladiator-movie that we came to see, enough to forego our mundane worries about what's wrong with the state of things. We see the emperor place miniatures of gladiators in a replica of the arena and this is followed by a majestic aerial shot of tiny particles of people flushing towards the Colosseum for the movie.Then it's the hero's vision of what he can achieve by agreeing to play his part in that spectacle, redemption. He does this by not entertaining, by showing mercy and challenging our demand for bloodshed, though only after this has been sated by protracted killing.But does any of this does what it says? The answer for me is no. If it did along the lines it sets up, we'd leave this disgusted by the hollow spectacle and not secretly titillated, informed by the possibility of mercy for redemption and not glorying in the revenge.No the only powerful thing here for me is the further nested vision of Maximus that gives him strength to keep going; the vision of loved ones.Scott wisely discerned that this had to be bound to a tangible place, the lovely home in the Roman countryside, that it would be our visual tether as we strayed to the accidental world of organized cruelties. It's all anchored on this spot. The shot of his hand caressing the rippling wheat is on his way to meet them, imagined, at first as a much anticipated return from years of war, later as a reunion in the next world.Scott could have done so much more to visually caress the place in mind but the fact that he places it at the center tells me he was wise to the power of vision and mind. Isn't the shot of the dirt road leading up to the house lined with cypress trees rippling in the wind one of the most memorable images here? Maximus description of the house to the emperor conjures the imagery the camera omits, earthy smells and textures.Several magnitudes more powerful than any vindication in the arena, the power of this vision would be that of not losing sight of what makes us human, not letting the darkness of dungeons and arenas of life pull this anchor.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Very honorable man...,"""Gladiator"" is excellent film. It has very strong message of honesty, honor, dignity and love. Do you still remember this words...? Russel Crowe is in a role of Maximus, Roman general, who is favorite of Marcus Aurelius, Roman Cezar, who wishes Maximus to be a Roman Protector, a guardian of Roman republic. Aurelis son, Commodus, has some other plans... Maximus was very popular amongst Roman army, but, over the night everything changes... In this movie, Ridley Scott guides us through ancient Rome, through it's plots, factions and nasty tricks. Great camera, picture, music and effects is visual luxury; movie has action, story, great players and moral. Oliver Reed is great as Proximus, the spirit of old Rome, honest and bloody, when human life has very little meaning. Violence in this movie makes the point - in movie where human life on battlefields has no importance at all, it show us how meaningless and horrible and monstrous is taking human life in Arena, or killing helpless women and children for political causes...Russel Crowe is really good. His tired face is representing human struggle between honor or surrender...",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Still the greatest movie ever after 23 years,"Gladiator was my favorite film when it came out 23 yrs ago and after rewatching it today with our now adult children, I realized that it still is. The cinematography is breath taking, the acting incredible, the battle scenes rival Game of Thrones and the story line is heart wrenching while the music is moving. It does not feel dated and is simply a masterpiece and felt as fresh today as it did in 2000. Luckily, one of my kids agreed and she's hard to please.Not sure what to expect for Gladiator 2 but the fact that Ridley Scott is directing it once again, should put my mind at ease. Just concerned that it won't have as strong a lead as Russel Crow and great actors like Joaquim Phoenix and Danish actress Leslie Nielsen.Anyway, would highly recommend Gladiator again after nog having seen it in 20 yrs.

Gladiator - good but flawed.,"Plenty of other folks here have written good reviews about the acting/directing in this film, but I feel a need to whinge.I went to see this film with high hopes and for the most part I was far from disappointed but. there were I feel, failures.The much vaunted special effects were indeed impressive and there were scenes that are truly awesome. However for me the scenes that least required special effects i.e. the fight sequences were ruined by the addition of a bizarre blurring / juddering effect that rendered them unintelligible. Considering it is a film about gladiators you really would expect to be able to see what was going on, especially in the fights.In a sci-fi the effects can be up-front, in a film about gladiators the special effects should be invisible.There that's my whinging over. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A film that opens the floodgates to what?,"'Gladiator' received numerous awards and has attracted over 2000 largely favourable user comments on IMDb. Although my comments will not be well received by those who regard it as a great film, I believe this is an APPALLING film which should never have been released. A film can be appalling because of bad direction, bad acting, or just plain bad photography - none of these are the problem here. A film can also be appalling because it plagiarises an earlier film too closely without giving any recognition to it, because it is intellectually dishonest, because its contents are antisocial, or because its nature is such that it is highly prejudicial to the film industry as a whole - the last three of these concerns all seem to me to arise with Gladiator. Some IMDb users have expressed concerns about plagiarism - noting its very close structural similarities to 'Braveheart' (1995) and 'Tarkan' (1969), but these are not my concern. When the scenario of a new film is totally different to its predecessor it is hard to justify condemning it for plagiarism.'Gladiator' features exactly the same scenario as the 1964 film 'The Fall of the Roman Empire' which is quite an elegant work that probably deserved to be more successful than it was. But it had one fatal flaw. It was promoted as an historically accurate account of the relatively short historical period when the Roman Empire appears to have undergone a fundamental transformation from an aggressive expansionist would be world empire to a survivalist mode where its main concern became the protection of its existing boundaries. This period, well documented by Gibbon and others, occurred after the death by disease of the stoic Emperor Marcus Aurelius whilst on campaign in A.D. 180. His son Commodus, who had already been co-emperor for three years, assumed full authority at the early age of nineteen with the support of Marcus's trusted advisers, but gradually after four years rule he became increasingly cruel and capricious, showing many signs of insanity, and finally acting in such a way that he was murdered in a palace conspiracy. His successor tried to repair the damage done to the fabric of Roman society but ultimately proved too weak and was murdered in turn, leading to a long period of increasing instability. The highly respected Will Durant was listed as historical consultant for the making of this 1964 film, but his advice was clearly neglected as the film incorrectly showed Marcus rejecting his son as heir to the throne, and his son responding by murdering his father and seizing the throne. Later it showed Commodus killed in the Arena whereas he was in fact drugged and strangled in his palace. Incredibly, this totally fictitious story from the earlier film was repeated in Gladiator. To me this makes the film unacceptable for intellectual dishonesty. We are told it is just a film prepared for entertainment. Fine - BUT ONLY IF IT DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE A HISTORICAL FILM. 'The Sign of the Cross', 'Ben Hur', 'Quo Vadis' and 'Caesar and Cleopatra' were promoted as films of literary works not as historical works, and I have no problem with this. But a film has an enormous audience compared with a historical treatise and, if it is thought to be presenting real history, its inaccuracies can be very misleading. Most people who lived through the holocaust have now died and already a concerted campaign, making extensive use of the media to deny that it ever happened, is under way. If public perception of its reality is ever reduced to the status of a largely mythical event, it will severely handicap the chance of humanity learning essential lessons from history. YES, HISTORICAL ACCURACY IS OF IMPORTANCE, certainly in everything except a declared work of fiction.'Gladiator' is also appalling because much of its appeal comes from the graphic killing of one human being by another in the name of sport. The Roman Games started as athletic contests with readings of literature and dramatic presentations, followed quite early by events involving the public punishment and execution of criminals. The latter evolved into gladiatorial contests where criminals who would be useful in the all important Roman armies could redeem themselves; and much later into the staging of public atrocities which sometimes even featured women and children being killed by wild beasts or burned alive. It has taken humanity many hundreds of years to totally reject such 'entertainment' and pogroms of various types still occur in many parts of the world with alarming frequency. The first step towards establishing higher standards is the banning of public executions, but 'Gladiator' makes extensive use of computer generated images which give all the vicarious thrills of watching whilst one person kills another. It also takes a giant step along the slippery slope of virtual reality which could eventually permit viewers to 'experience' actual participation in such events. IS THIS WHAT WE REALLY WANT FROM THE CINEMA?The 1934 Hayes code which crippled the North American film industry for many years resulted from an overwhelming public demand to restrict films that overstepped the bounds of public acceptability. A third reason why 'Gladiator' is an appalling film is that it has pushed the limits of acceptability to the point where there will be demands for some new form of censorship. Today there is more and more emphasis being put on self regulation whether in government or in corporate life. If the film industry cannot face up to its need for some self regulation IT MAY LOSE ITS ARTISTIC FREEDOM AND BE RETURNED TO THE DARK AGES OF EXTERNALLY IMPOSED PRODUCTION 'CODES'.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Such a Mixed Bag,"I absolutely love Ridley Scott.  ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"" both rank among my favorite films.

He fights, he broods, he whines...but he's never really forced to stretch his talents.My main quibble, I suppose, is that the movie was clearly going for ""Braveheart"" effect, and it fails.  It was easy to get some sympathy going for Mel Gibson's character in ""Braveheart.""  He was fighting for freedom and justice.  Sadly for ""Gladiator,"" it's pretty hard to develop much sympathy for any particular faction within the Roman empire.  Where ""Braveheart"" was able to give us a few effective hallucinations and dream sequences, ""Gladiator"" shoves it down our throat with oddly-colored, tripping-on-acid dream sequences every five minutes.  Yes, we get the point.  He misses his family, and he'll see them in the afterlife.  Move on already!Apart from the dream sequences, the movie does look pretty spectacular.  The Colliseum is an impressive sight.  The costumes, for once in a sword-and-sandal epic, don't look like the costume department simply raided the bedding department at K-Mart.

The Definition of 'Masterpiece',"David Franzoni's (Gladiator , King Arthur) prestigious writing skills, Ridley Scott's (Hannibal , Black Hawk Down) directing techniques, and a five-star cast present the audience with a true masterpiece. Also, outstanding music, set design, and battle effects create a solid, comfortable and emotional mood for viewers. Astonishing performances by Academy-Award winner Russell Crowe (A Beautiful Mind , Master and Commander), Academy-Award nominee Joaquin Phoenix (Signs , The Village [Not to mention, my favorite actor due to his performances.]), Connie Nielsen, and Richard Harris make this film a must-see. Spectacular battle scenes fill this movie, but I rather enjoy the work combination from Scott and Franzoni as they bring out a truly emotional storyline. Personally, the crew behind Gladiator definitely deserved the five Academy-Award (including Best Picture) victories. Did I forget the other seven nominations? I'll leave it at that.

admirable   work,"one of rare contemporary films who is, obvious, very, very close to be defined as perfect. because it illustrates a collection of virtues , many long time ignored, few not very familiar first, it is a great eulogy to a favorite genre of classic Hollywood. same recipes, same craft, same vision, same style. a Spartacus of a new millennium. then, it is a film of actors more than one of ""tricks"". and to say Russell Crowe/Oliver Reed/Joaquin Phoenix/Richard Harris does a great job is far to be enough. because the genius of Ridley Scott is to give not parts but an entire fresco. so, it is the film of each actor and fight scene and dramatic moment and touching sequence and fragment of impressive Rome. mix of poetry and history and epic and science of detail, it is a classic. it sounds precious but it is only the truth. because it is , in same measure, a film for heart and mind. and a courageous exercise to resurrect the force and fascinations of the historical blockbusters from the decades VII - VIII.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
My Favourite One,"Gladiator begins with a war scene that is one nice steal of masterwork which gives you goosebumps from the beginning. Also the fights of Gladiator as slave are brilliant and suspenseful. The film is probably more appreciated if you're interested in Rome and all that has to do with this former empire of the Earth. Not only Russel Crowe but all the actors did a great job. I especially loved the role of Commodus though he is the bad guy. A mighty character, but then again, not almighty. The scene where Gladiator and Commodus, the emperor, face each other is one of the best scenes I've ever seen and that has touched me like no other scene has ever done. Gladiator can be seen as one of the best films ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
As good as a concept movie gets/a perfect Verhoeven pic shot by Ridley Scott,"`Gladiator` is the symbol of Hollywood`s renewed intrest in medieval subjects and stories.Since techno-thriller self-destructed under the burden of Hollywood`s commercial expectations enchant history became the new well of ideas for moguls.This is why `The 13th Warrior` hit the silver screen and why `Joan of Arc` got funding from Hollywood.`Gladiator` takes as back to the past when Western Civilisation wasn`t as great as we know it since the majority of people weren`t aware that there is only one God. `Gladiator` is the story of the Roman general Maximus who gets involved in royal plots during the time of Marcus Aurelius` reign.Because of his position he gets punished but he escapes death.Unfortunately his family gets slaughtered and he becomes a slave that ends up as a gladiator in Roman Arena.In Rome Maximus plots to avenge his family`s death and to take Roman Empire back to the right path. `Gladiator` is a competent return to`swords and sandals` mythology and the movie doesn`t fail where it`s predecesors did.It is expensive,large-scale story with great actors.Performances of Russell Crowe and Oliver Reed are especially enjoyable and Joaquin Phoenix really gives edge to the character of Commodus,the villain Emperor.Russell Crowe iz amazing and his acting really fits the epic scale of characters behaving and tragedy. Since `L.A.Confidential` it was obvious that Crowe is `the next big thing` and he finally proved it again in `Gladiator`. The script has fine moments but it is generally routine stuff.It isn`t edgy but it does make mistakes concerning history.I mean I ain`t no historian but authors avoid the religious aspect of the plot.Even though Crowe prays to one God while the young `Replacement Emperor` and his sister use plural in religious conversations. The ending is a nice idea but it is bad written and bad writing includes cheesy lines spoken by `as hard as it gets` Crowe. `Gladiator` also features a supportng role Djimon Hounsou the `Dream Works SKG nigger`(remember him in `Amistad` also made by `Dream Works SKG`?). Ridley Scott`s direction is mature and atractive and he proves true the thing Michael Mann said about him to Crowe(Mann said that Scott is among top two percent of shooters in business).His direction is inspired in visual sense and thus he gives us some hot sword  fighting and animal action.The shots of Arena in all it`s glory are impressive and kudos also go to cinematographer John Mathieson who shot Kevin Allen`s masterpiece `Twin Town`.Ridley Scott can`t avoid the classic `Dream Works SKG` blueish colour orientation but this is a legit landmark of the studio.... Overall `Gladiator` is a must-see not because of it`s substance but because of the fact that it interprets some of the classic myths of human culture in the manner of a 100-million studio picture which is fine. I hope that great box-office result of this movie would boost production of such anticipated projects like Michael Mann`s `Spartans` with George Clooney and Verhoeven`s `Crusade` with Arnold Scwarzenegger. If Verhoeven had directed `Gladiator` it would have been a masterpiece.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"""Scotty, beam me up"" - Ridley Scott gives you a taste of ancient Rome","The Colosseum... A place that stands not only for being one of the most beautiful monuments of the Roman Empire, but also a place at which many a great warrior has died. Death in the service of keeping the people of Rome entertained, preventing them from even thinking of an uprising against the ruling caesar. Even today, many peolle travel specifically to Rome to see the remnants of this huge palace of entertainment.That Rome stands central in a movie called ""Gladiator"" may be not that remarkable. What though is remarkable that there was such a long time since the last popular movie in the ""swords and sandals""-genre... Actually, it was 1958 - with a movie named ""Ben Hur"" - that we saw such a highly rated movie in its genre.And the wait was more than wortwile! Because Gladiator tells its story - in the most intricate of detail - in an extremely beautiful way! The buildings, vehicles, clothing, weapons and other props are all so beautiful that they just suck you up in the world of ancient Rome. The scenery is just so breathtaking that it will leave you with the impression that you just sat yourself on the bleachers of the Colloseum!The storyline is losely based on the real rulers of the second century Roman empire. Marcus Aurelius and his evil son Conmodus form the basis of the story. It is thereby one of the Roman generals named Maximus that stands central in this movie. Played by Russell Crowe, Maximus is forced to become a Gladiator. And the life of that Gladiator stands central in this movie.The supreme acting of not only Crowe but also many of the other actors makes this movie belong to a list of movies that you can watch multiple times during your life. And you are wrong if you think that its 2h35m duration may cause you to get bored. My own experience was that the movie was over before I even noticed it! And mind you, this was already the second time that I watched this movie since it was released.Watching this movie was such a great experience that I gave it a well-deserved 10 stars. I will most certainly watch this movie again in the future.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Beautiful film!,"'Gladiator' is a spectacle of note and a film everyone should see at least once. Jealousy, ambition, greed, betrayal, loyalty, and vengeance are all so well illustrated here. It is an excellent script and very well executed.Russell Crowe is good as Maximus, a man who lost everything in the blink of an eye. Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic as the antagonist, Commodus. Commodus is the epitome of a true villain. You will hate him. The film features all round good performances from a seasoned cast.Despite the film's long running time, it is never boring. From the impressive opening battle scene to the climatic finale, it is action and intrigue all the way. However, due to the film's theme, there's a lot of bloody and violent killings, hence the film can be grim and depressing at times.Ultimately, though, 'Gladiator' is a fantastic tale of vengeance. The photography is beautiful and the sweeping score is filled with so much emotion. Despite plenty of brutality, 'Gladiator' is still an absolutely beautiful film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Not as much pomp and a lot more circumstance,"What do you do when everything that could be done in a gladiator movie has been done? And the script is right out of the old Charles Bronson revenge movies for having family unjustly dispatched by the evil authority. There can never be another, ""Ben-Hur"" (1959), a movie made in its time, for its time, and an untouchable classic.This gladiator movie is for today's audience and may someday become a classic. Instead of having a splashy image like John Wayne, Russell Crowe has to blend in with the movie and the story. He must be ruthless and compassionate almost at the same time.Of course, if you just concentrate on Russell Crowe, you will miss many other great actors, not the least of which is Derek Jacobi as Senator Gracchus. You can see him again as Brother Cadfael in ""A Morbid Taste for Bones"".What is this? The new Roman Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). See Joaquin again as Johnny Cash in ""Walk the Line.""Although there is quite a substantial amount of displayed hemoglobin, this is not the main purpose of the movie.

The best epic movie in our times,"The best movie in the year 2000 was the Gladiator, which was directed by R. Scott and written by D. Franzoni. The main actor is Russell Crowe.The film was set in Ancient Rome . One  of the characters is Maximus Decimus Meridius, loyal servant of the Emperor of Rome Marco Aurelius, who is betrayed by the Emperor's corrupted son the prince. When  his family is murdered and he escaped death,he returned to Rome to seek revenge as a gladiator.I enjoyed the film because, in my opinion, all the parts of the movie were wonderfully performed and directed. The costunes are according to when and where the story takes place. Another important aspect is the scenery that is surprising, for example when the Gladiator has to fight against the Prince in the majestic Colleseum.I don't recommend this movie, I simply tell you: ""You MUST see this film!"" I you don't, you will miss the best epic story of the last years.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"""We are all ultimately dead men. We cannot choose when we die, but we can choose how... so that we are remembered""","This is probably the most sadly ironic line of Oliver Reed, here in his final film role. A cut 'n' paste last scene aside, the veteran actor gives a graceful performance in a film which would see his death before completion.Sadly, British audiences now associate the star more with a performance on Channel 4 programme ""After Dark""; where, amongst a group of chin-scratching pseuds on a discussion show a drunken Reed argued and forcibly snogged a large lady who was far from amused. ""Do you want me to go?"" questioned Ollie, who promptly did, gin in hand, when the rest of the guests begged him to leave the studio. Or maybe his most famous moment would be a slot on a primetime chat show, a jug of orange juice and vodka in hand, bellowing the lyrics to ""Wild One"".If only for giving Ollie back his grace does Gladiator deserve praise. Direction, while derivative and gimmicky, is also well done (though it's easily Ridley Scott's weakest work). Derek Jacobi has a nice role, most famous, of course, for the mini series I, Clavdivs. Russell Crowe is Russell Crowe, all mean, macho and moody with a tiny glimmer of sensitivity underneath. A bit dull for a film that lasts ten days or however long this one went on for.The visions of the afterlife are a little bit silly, and there's never a moment when you don't know how it's all going to end. But objectively, this is a film you can admire. Subjectively, I was bored rigid and kept losing concentration all the way through. Don't mistake me, I enjoy a good epic, but there's no emotional involvement to root you to this film, and ultimately I didn't care about Crowe's character.Sometimes the CGI is a little too obvious, already dated whereas the 50-odd year old Ben Hur still stands up. I laughed at the tiger that looked like it'd come straight out of a ZX Spectrum, and as for the dead one. I was reminded of comedian Brian Connelly. His catchphrase? ""It's a puppeeeeeeeeeeet!""The villain is a nice portrayal of the guy that just wants to be loved. But what makes him such a bad guy? Maybe it's the fact that he kills his father, wants to sleep with his sister and has a harelip. No grey areas for Ridley. Crowe is the manly, bronzed, masculine guy that all the women love.Gladiator is not a bad film, and I did give it a ""6"". I would have awarded a higher mark, if only it didn't singularly succeed in boring the pants off me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"50% spectacle, 50% cheese","Well, it's safe to say that ""Gladiator"" is far from a disappointment.  It'll also satisfy many, particularly fans of the sandle-epics of the '50's and '60s.  Be forewarned, however, despite the innately cheesy dialogue and innane plot diversions, ""Gladiator"" is anything but an old-fashioned technicolor epic.  If anything, ""Gladiator"" moves too far the other way, employing an MTV-generation editing style and visual aesthetic that is dizzying and, moreover, overstated.  As well, Scott makes the dreadful mistake of beginning his film with a battle scene that is shot and edited in a fashion identical to the opening scene of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" complete with washed-out colours, varied speeds of motion and muffled sound. If you can look over this, however, you're in for some truly spectacular Gladiator fight scenes in a cinematic mock-up of the Roman Coliseum and 2nd century A.D. Rome.  Here, Scott's style shines, in much the same way it did with Blade Runner almost 2 decades previous.  Rome's ancient architecture is rendered believably real, with the employment of special effect techniques that seemed frivolous and tiresome in last year's ""Star Wars: Episode 1, The Phantom Menace.""  Strangely enough, the future of the historical epic looks bright.  And so does Russell Crowe's career, mind you.  He manages to ground the film with his character, even when it seems as if the plot is about to drift off into a cheesy abyss.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"I am Maximus, mumble, grunt, rasp!","I can't even describe how much I loath this film, but being a hater I'll try.Lets begin with the historical representation first. Personally I don't give a hoot if the facts are all wrong, if the uniforms and clothing and use of weaponry are historically incorrect. (People who's concerns about this dragon of a film tend that way, I gave those geeks wedgies in High-school) But the representation of the Roman empire as a benign benefactor spreading civilization through out the world is ludicrous, such sentiments belong to the aforementioned wedgie sufferers and elitist euro-republicans.Then there's the script, which is a pathetic attempt at lyrical writing, even Fran Walsh and Peter Jackson could do a better job. Never the less, it was amusing in a so-bad-it's-funny sorta way.And Russel Crowe, let's not forget the torment of watching Russel Crowe act. It's like his brawling: fake and an attempt to hide his 80's new wave rock alter ego; Russ Le Rock. But his constipated stoicism and grunting and mumbling will appear as the classic lone warrior acting to the low-brows who love this film.Oh, Yes and then there's the music. When I heard Rock like rhythms played over roman soldiers marching, I laughed out loud, usually anachronistic film-scoring is the fort√© of Asian cinema, that can pull this stunt.

This movie has everything -- Action, Drama, Politics, History and Romance (but not too much of it which is good). The action sequences are superb, both the battle scene and the fighting scene. Every details are captured tastefully, & not too gory. The acting is always superb. Russell Crowe was such a natural. I love him!! and his character, Maximus. I'm so glad he won an Oscar which he rightfully deserved. At last not least, the soundtrack was so great that it sounds good just by itself (I still listen to it everyday!!). Also I should not forget to mention the special effect like the reconstruction of the ancient Rome and the Colosseum.

Plot goes haywire - power surges abound,"Gladiator overwhelmed the opposition in Academy voting this year.  Yet those who cry ""foul"" are strikingly naive in their calls for some sort of recount. It is a prime example of Oscar voters going for a big winner when the ""second-place"" entries managed to cancel out one another's separate claims to be better overall films.  This BEST PICTURE shows signs of being less than the sum of most of its commendable parts, due in greatest part to its haywire plot.  Like the much feared power surges for people's home and work computers, it has plenty of emotional highs and striking brief scenes or cuts but they short-circuit the narrative that you want to puzzle through after the final credits.  I believe the screenplay could have made some sort of ""revisionist"" sense about an introspective Emperor but he is throttled and overthrown in some sort of flip-flop of fortunes that's left unexplained.  Don't blame Joaquin Phoenix for overacting when he seemingly improvises with the lurching dialogue.  For anybody trying to make sense of slavery and gladiators, see a much better film from 1960, Spartacus. Back then actor Kirk Douglas and buddies were telling the director what the finished product should be.  Nowadays, the director uses all the arrows in his quiver to nail us to the trees and we wonder what's hit us as the spectacle overpowers the story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"A worthy film, though not without flaw","Gladiator is an epic film.  A moving story with good characters. I must compliment all the actors, Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix especially.  I felt I understood all the characters, each had motivation, goals, and a personality.  To those who have belittled Phoenix's performance, I suggest you check whether he was merely playing an unlikable and deranged character very well, or if his actual acting was lacking.  I think the former is the case. I did notice a few flaws.   The first was the excessive and obvious use of CGI, which I feel gave the movie an unreal and unbelievable look at times. The second flaw involves the historical accuracy of the film.  While this only slightly detracted from the film, I did find it distracting.  For example, I seem to have noticed stirrups in use (certainly the actor's foot position suggested stirrups), which weren't invented until the millenium after the time depicted.  Pens and paper, and other minor inaccuracies were to be noticed if you were in the know.  As I said though, these minor inaccuracies did not take away from the depiction of the film.  Of course, the largest inaccuracy is the eventual outcome of the film, with regards to the fate of the Roman empire, which I will not reveal.  In the end however, this is a story, for entertainment, not a historical documentary, and I am more than happy to forgive and overlook such transgressions in the name of a good film, which this definitely is. The only other complaint I have about the film was the use of cuts to the 'dream world'.  These cuts are confusing for most of the picture.  Who is having them?  Why?  What do they mean?  They gave the film a disjointed feel to me.  Though eventually the reasons for these 'dreams' becomes clear, their execution left something to be desired for me. The conclusion?  ""Gladiator"" is a fine film, worth seeing.  The closest to an epic film I have seen in some time, ""Gladiator"" regales with war and love, vengeance and madness.

One of the best movies I've seen - especially among modern films,"I typically prefer classic films because I, for one, don't think Hollywood makes movies like they used to. Plus, I think most modern films are heavy on the sex and foul language - and as a Christian, I find it offensive.So it is rare when Hollywood puts out not only a great film in terms of the quality of the story and the performances, but which also has very little language and no explicit sexual content (inspite of this being rated R but that is due to the violence).This movie did something that rarely happens with me in modern films in that it completely absorbed me into the time period, the location and the story. I felt somewhat transported for the entire length - which given its long running time, was quite a feat. It never once seemed to lag or get slow - but kept my complete attention. Not only that, but I have seen this film numerous times (probably at least 6 times) and it never fails to capture my complete attention - even though I know what is going to happen next. That is the sign of not only a great movie - but a MASTERPIECE in my opinion.Crowe's performance was amazing, but I'm a little surprised that he won, while Joaquin Phoenix was ROBBED. He was nominated, but lost to Benicio Del Torro for TRAFFIC. Phoenix's portrayal of Commodus was so completely engrossing - the creep factor was exponential. I think his is one of the all time great villainous portrayals - but in ways that at times were so subtle that it made him even more despicable.I only had one mild complaint of the film which is I felt the past history between Lucilla and Maximus was not completely explained and I think would have enriched the understanding of the 2 characters.I own very few DVD's but this is one that we did end up getting since it never fails to deliver a completely absorbing experience - time after time!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Are You Not Entertained?,"Gladiator is a masterpiece of revenge, power through awe, and the incredible production and acting. The roman warrior motifs of honor and glory combined with emotions and loss house an unforgettable movie.
It all unfolds in Ancient Rome where a prestigious general of a large army meets with the emperor during a battle. The emperor tells the general, Maximus Decimus Meridias, that he will give the throne to Maximus when he passes. After that, he calls his son, Commodus, in and shares the news. His son kills him in anger. He lies that the throne is his and demands Maximus to either join him or die. Maximus refuses and then escapes death. He comes home to find his family killed and his house burned with them. From everything to nothing, he is then captured by slave traders and through a series of events, he ends up a gladiator. He spends the rest of his time using the glory of a honorable gladiator to take the throne as his own in a path he could not have predicted.
The theme of revenge is this movie. Maximus was guided by revenge in all of his actions. His desire was unstoppable. The film makes sure that you feel sympathetic for Maximus as he loses his life in a single day. But if you take a step out of the perspective the director offers there is a moral dilemma for us all. The question to ask is: To what extent can revenge consist of before becoming unjustified? Does Commendus deserve death, prison, or what? The director expresses his opinion at the end on what the situation warrants.
The other major theme shown is power through awe. Maximus gains power through the people and their perspective. It is directly relatable to our world today. If people entertain us, we will support and follow them. In Gladiator, it is taken advantage of by Maximus. He realizes it after his first battle and the people are on their feet cheering while the camera swivels around Maximus as he gradually figures out what he has just accidentally devised. Almost how President Trump gained his following largely through gaining attention in the media, Maximus gained reputation through entertainment.
There is a reason Russell Crowe, the actor of Maximus, won the Academy Award for Best Actor for Gladiator. He truly played the idea of a man losing his life. Just the way he almost seemed silent and speechless as if he just still was shocked about what had happened. The flashbacks from his farm and family collides with reality and you see it in Russell's eyes and tone as he fades between the two. The mood he sparkes will make any viewer close to tears. His excellence in playing Maximus prevails throughout the movie and conveys sympathy to the viewer, generating an emotion connection to the character.
The soundtrack is filled with honor and glory of a true roman patriotic warrior. It fits perfectly in the setting and motifs of Gladiator. The soundtrack added an immense amount of emotion to convey Maximus' expressions to our heart. The audience is prepared through the setup of Russell's acting from action scenes to messages of family and glory and once the soundtrack hits your emotions come crashing with it. In the right moments, the soundtrack enlightens the honor and glory of the movie admirably.
The only issue I have is the realism. It's a historic film and as a man of realism myself, it hurts to see people die in a finger snap from an arrow no the chest. While it is not perfect, I must applaud how much it differs from current mainstream movies such as the movies by the director Michael Bay whom loves to have explosions and extremely intense gunfire where military marines miss all their shots on the main character running away in an open field. So in a sense, I can not say it was far off ideal as it is in an arm length's away.
Similarly to the movie, The Blind Side, where the main character has nothing at the beginning and you find yourself feeling sympathy for the character, Gladiator bring that same hopeful and inspiring tone in a roman-era twist that affixes honor and glory. Gladiator has been my favorite film ever since I saw it. The components all manufacture an astonishing production of emotion and glory. With that being said, I require you to watch it immediately.

Crowe & Phoenix Carry This Epic To Greatness,"Gladiator is a film that shouldn't work nearly as well as it does. It is fraught with director Ridley Scott's indulgent tendencies and develops its characters in fits-and-spurts rather than naturally. Fortunately, Gladiator has the casting of a lifetime in its corner--and that is largely what carries the picture to greatness.For a very basic overview, Gladiator tells the story of Maximus (Russell Crowe), the once-leader of Rome's army now turned gladiator slave at the hands of new tyrant ruler Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). While fighting all that the Colosseum can throw at him, Maximus must also inspire a revolution to return Rome to its former glory.There are some contradictory elements at play in Gladiator, to be sure. The whole Scott production is so overwrought and melodramatic as to border on the ludicrous. At the same time, though, Scott's visuals and action sequences are the stuff of Hollywood legend. There are times you might be rolling your eyes a bit--then other times when you are 100% locked in. The same goes for the Roman Empire/Senate rhetoric: at times prescient, at other times over-the-top.But ultimately Gladiator needs to accomplish just two main goals and does so with aplomb thanks to tremendous casting and acting performances.First, this is a movie that almost squarely rests on Crowe's simmering intensity and deep integrity in the Maximus role. I honestly don't think his dialogue is even all that strong--but Crowe's very countenance (sometimes even without words at all) is so powerful that it transcends any script shortcomings. I cannot think of another actor who could have turned in such a nuanced, show-carrying performance. His persecution and redemption arcs are exclusively carried by this magnetism.On the flip side, one must also buy into Commodus as the sniveling little weasel he is--and Phoenix (as he has repeatedly shown in the 20+ years hence) is more than up to that task. At once the most powerful person in Rome and Maximus's foil, Phoenix embodies that conflict remarkably. His is a character born to audience hatred and thus serving to make Crowe's Maximus all the more heroic.Overall, Gladiator ends up being a powerful watch every time. Even as a rather non-traditional swords-and-sandals Oscar darling in 2001, I can see why it inspired a great many golden statues to its possession. Two decades after its theatrical debut the intensity of Crowe, Phoenix, and some of the Colosseum scenes haven't dulled one iota.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Gimme a break!,"Gladiator is a corny shoot-em-up movie with a plot about as simplistic as Star Wars.....hence the Oscar for Best Picture.  The special effects were good (not as good as those in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon), but the story was just plain lacking; a man with some fighting skills has his family killed, is imprisoned, forced to fight, and eventually kills the source of it all in a thoughtlessly and simplisticly set-up battle in the end of the movie.  I mean, what the hell was the emperor of Rome doing fighting a gladiator in a colosseum in the first place?  Did the writers not know how to end the movie in a more clever manner?  Stabbing Russel Crowe in the back with a knife didn't ""cut it"" for me, no pun intended.  Gladiator was entertaining, and was certainly worth some form of an Oscar, but it was definitely not ""Best Picture"" material.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The Cinematography,"Say what you will about the acting, historical inaccuracy, action scenes, Russell Crowe, etc... One thing that stands the test of time and makes modern films look like a joke is the cinematography in this movie. It is decades ahead of everything else that came out during that time, and still ahead of all the poorly produced big budget series and films that come out nowadays. It could be mostly because everything nowadays is filmed with digital cameras and the lighting is off as a result. This came out at a rare time in human history when movies weren't made to be vessels for whatever political ideology the writers/director wanted to push on their audience. Instead there are powerful characters of all genders and races that appear naturally in the film, and there is an incredible amount of effort in the quality of dialogue + soundtrack that beautifully intertwines. This is without a doubt one of the best films of the 21st century, still to this day unmatched by an excess of overpaid directors and writers who would've never made it past their pitch meetings 20 years ago.I have heard rumors Hollywood is attempting to reboot Gladiator, or make a sequel. You can expect that to be a mockery of this film on every possible artistic level.

"An old-fashioned hero, brilliantly portrayed","There isn't much I can add that hasn't already been said, but what made this movie so special for me was Russell Crowe's brilliant portrayal of Maximus as a genuine hero of Shakespearean proportions.  I don't mean to imply that there is any resemblance between Gladiator and one of Shakespeare's plays, or that the dialogue resembles one of them. But the creation of a truly heroic character in a pivotal role is a classical and, unfortunately, out of date device.  It requires an actor who can not only convince you that his character possesses a heroic and noble nature, but who can also make you care terribly about what happens to this hero.  Crowe does both.  The viewer loves and admires his Maximus, and agonizes with him in his travails.  In this, Crowe reminded me of Laurence Olivier at a comparable age, although I'd guess he would cringe at the comparison. As to the rest of the cast, I couldn't find a single weak link.  In fact, the only thing I didn't like about the movie was the extent of the gore in the battle and gladiator scenes.  I can't believe that so many prolonged grisly scenes were necessary to get the movie's point across.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

It said that the movie lacked character development and dialogue....rubbish!

The scenes are eye candy to watch and the action scenes of course are dazzling and well choreographed. It has been a long time since I have seen a movie that has had this much of an impact on me.

Pointless gorefest,"What we have here is a mixture of Ben Hur and Braveheart, and unsurprisingly it sucks.The main objective of the film seems to be to cram as much gore as possible in the space of a single movie, without bothering about trivialities like story, character or meaning. If it purports to show the beastliness of staged human fights to the death it utterly fails because it only lowers the viewers to the same voyeuristic level as the Romans themselves.Who cares about Maximus, a cardboard character with revenge as his only motivation? What to make of the crazy editing in the fight scenes that makes it impossible to understand what is going on? What with the bizarre geography and time lines? How to make sense of the opening battle which is claimed to be about a German settlement, yet takes place in the open and shows cavalry charging through a dense forest? Why the fake poetry of the hand in the wheat field? Who cares? Gore, gore and more gore, that is what sells tickets and, incredibly, delivers Oscars.The only thing I could appreciate, contrary to many others here, is Joaquin Phoenix' portrayal of Commodus as he descends from mere creepiness into downright raving lunacy.

An epic masterpiece.  One of the greatest films of all time...,"An aging Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) has decided not to leave the empire of Rome in the hands to his only son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) and instead has decided to leave it to Rome's greatest General and his greatest friend Maximus (Russell Crowe). Forced to make a decision by morning, Maximus sleeps on the idea while Marcus Aurelius breaks the news to his son who does not take it well and kills his father in his anger.Maximus wakes up in the morning to hearing the news of the Emperor's death, the only one knowing who the true successor was supposed to be and with an accurate assumption of who killed the Emperor. Refusing to pledge his allegiance to Commodus, Maximus is sentenced to death and escapes and journeys to save his family, only to find them all dead. With nothing left to loose, he lives his new life as a gladiator called The Spaniard, taking his vengeance on other gladiators.This is one of the greatest epic stories told on film. The idea of a man with nothing to loose has intrigued audiences for years but not since Russell Crowe have they witnessed the barbaric violence of a roman gladiator. Crowe plays the greatest gladiator I could have ever imagined and Joaquin Phoenix is one the greatest, most complicated villain ever shown on film.The action is incredible. Not since Braveheart, has there been such wonderful battles and fight sequences. From beheadings to throat slits, Gladiator does not hesitate to show the gory realism of the roman Coliseum. Breathtaking surroundings bring Rome to life though eloquent displays of architecture and the large quantities of people, quenching their thirst for the mindless violence shown in the roman arena. This as well as the wonderful writing and incredible acting bring Rome to life as well as creating a story that could entertain anyone.Gladiator is so inspiring and entertaining that I could watch it daily and still find myself still feeling as strongly as I feel about it now.

"Roar of Battle, the Roar of Crowds","Ridley Scott brings his stylistic sense to the historical epic in this recreation of the Roman Empire at its zenith. This time frame is actually ahead of the usual one with Julius Caesar that we're mostly used to seeing and actually takes place, I believe, during the same time as the elder epic ""The Fall of the Roman Empire""(64). By the title and the hearsay, you'd expect the story to revolve around gladiatorial combat in the arena, but though some of the significant scenes do take place there, the scope encompasses all of Rome and its surrounding provinces. The beginning is a lengthy sequence depicting a final battle in the war against Germania, a brutal & staggering depiction of two armies in combat. It's here that director Scott presents the flavor of what the viewer will become accustomed to as the picture progresses: important people, important events, important decisions - set to an epic scale, of course.But it's the people portion of the formula that dominates what could have been just another epic. Maximus (Crowe), a Roman general at the start of the pic, makes it clear very early where his priorities lie: with his wife & son, whom he hasn't seen in over two years. Yet, he's also intensely loyal to the empire and the emperor (Harris). We realize he's caught between the two responsibilities at this early stage of the film and it's not a simple dilemma; priorities must be weighed, possible impacts both personal & political. Although a decision is taken out of his hands, we see that it's not a simple solution of 'well, i'll go home' as he desired which would have dictated his actions. There's real intelligence to the script by this point. Crowe won the Oscar for his part and though he probably was more deserving for a couple of other films, it's easy to see how he carried the picture here.The supporting cast is first rate. Phoenix as Commodus, the new emperor who takes the decision out of Maximus' hands, does not come across as a standard villain, despite his actions (patricide, lusting for his sister, sadistic murder). You see him make revolting faces during the gladiatorial games, reveling in the blood spilled, and of course you think, what a grotesque villain. Yet, in other scenes he is quite pitiful - it's astonishing we can feel any sympathy for this wretch, but Phoenix plays the 'daddy should have loved me' angle to the hilt - and it works. The no.1 position in the empire dictates that the holder cannot trust anyone, it's so true; no one seems more alone than Phoenix throughout the film. Oliver Reed hams it up a bit as an arena entertainer, but it is Reed, a fitting final role. There's a lot a class spread out among the remainder of the cast - Harris, Jacobi, Hemmings all lend some gravitas, and Connie Nielsen is very good in a truly regal role.Since much of this film involves gladiatorial combat, I must at least mention the fighting scenes in the various arenas. They are very well done. But they're probably not the main reason to see the picture.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

This movie is immersive unlike any other movie in a very long time. Where Episode I failed to give the audience characters they could care about or a plot they could decipher, Gladiator keeps things simple, elegantly depicting the conflict without clutter.

People give this movie too much credit,"Although it was not a bad movie, it was not all that good of a movie either. Ridley Scott seems to get more entertaining scripts every time he directs, but he gets worse and worse at directing. The battle scenes drove me up the wall.  The cameras are so close-up that all we can see is blood and movement.  The resolution is grainy and dirty looking, which makes it even harder to see.  Scott must also believe that the only way to show battle is by filming it like a music video.  A few seconds of a camera shot is shown, then a second of another shot, then another shot, then another and another for five minutes straight.  Now it's not only hard to see, but dizzying as well.  A better director would have used longer shots to show off good fight choreography, development and tactics of battle. But Scott takes the easy way out.Now we know we can't rely on the director for a good movie. The cast overall is good.  Commodus (Phoenix) has a few good moments, but is just too dull to be enjoyed as a villain.  Scott tries to give us pity for the bad guy to add depth to his character, but it doesn't work.  I didn't feel anything for him, hatred or pity.  I was a little surprised that Phoenix wasn't better than he was in the role of Commodus.  He is a talented actor and he was by far the best part of '8mm', but he will work for this movie.  The supporting cast does a good job in few scenes that they posses.  The gladiators are big and mean enough, the senators do their job to move the story along, but the best supporting performances come out of Proximo (Reed) and Commodus's sister, Lucilla(Nielson).As important as the supporting cast is, everything rides on Crowe's performance as Maximus. He does wonderful.  He carries this movie on his back with little help.  He broods and glares and doesn't talk much.  He has great reaction shots and is a good physical actor.  Without him, this movie has little redeeming qualities.With Crowe leading the charge, the movie is marginally entertaining and worth going to see.

An epic from the golden days of cinema.,"The Gladiator came out in 2000. One year later it would be followed by the Fellowship of the Ring. One year earlier, the Matrix had changed the way we look at scifi. It was a great movie of the rather rare ""historic fantasy"" genre (although at the time it was mislabeled a ""sword and sandal epic"") which has produced a rather limited number of great movies.But the Gladiator, unlike most movies of this genre, remains one of the most beloved Hollywood epics.In hindsight, the reason is obvious: it has Russel Crowe, the greatest rising star of that generation in top form, a form which sadly did not last very long. It has the one and only Ridley Scott going full throttle for the first time since Alien, delivering a visual masterpiece with some of the most iconic scenes of the 21st century, such as the ""hand that caresses the wheat in the field"", a shot that has been copied countless times.It has a great story, which is offensively inaccurate from a historical standpoint but catches the spirit of the devoted hero that falls victim of unethical powers, is betrayed, destroyed but yet he rises up and fulfills his destiny.And of course it has Hans Zimmer, whose soundtrack has become one of the most well known musical themes of all time.The movies was flawed and flawless at the same time, equally grand and inaccurate, epic and engaging, sad and exhilarating. It was a kick ass movie that nailed it.And, maybe above all, it was the most successful movie of a golden era of cinema:
From 1995 to 2005, cinema changed forever: directors broke boundaries in virtually every genre, from scifi (the Matrix) and fantasy (LOTR) to comedy (the Big Lebowski), action (Kill Bill), and drama (Fight club).Hell, even Chinese cinema had joined that great wave of innovative and brave filmmaking with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.The studios could not believe their luck. Veterans, newcomers, new writers, new cinematographers, everyone was at the top of their game, making great movie after great movie.I do not know exactly when this phenomenon started, but it is my firm belief that it was pushed to the forefront by Tarantino's Pulp Fiction.We were reaching the end of the century, a new millenium was about to begin, and suddenly everyone was up for trying something new.Ridley Scott was not new, of course, but the great recognition of his art and the artistic value of Blade Runner had become generally acknowledged only a few years ago, and this realization may have contributed to giving him the chance for a new visual masterpiece, helmed by an Australian newcomer who had only played one big part as supporting actor in a film noir (LA Confidential).Ridley gave it his all, and the Gladiator remains, to this day, his most successful and highest rated movie.Sadly, the wave of innovation did not last as long as it could: it was gradually replaced by the unprecedented success of the superhero movie, which almost destroyed cinema, first by razing the box office and once all the good movies had been made, by trying to outsell competition disguised as a form of social platform for inclusion, diversity, equality, gender rights, and all sorts of activist ideas.20years later, no mainstream studio cares anymore about making art or telling great stories.It's all about making good PR in Hollywood regardless of talent or content.We are now reaching a quarter of a century from the last golden era of cinema.The superhero genre has finally reached its inevitable end. And finally, after almost two decades, an exceptional historical movie (Oppenheimer) and an original concept (Barbie) are in the top-5 grossing movies of the year, while almost half of the new superhero movies have flopped.Let's just hope that we are nearing a new age of cinema, one where the medium can be restored to its former glory.The Gladiator remains, to this day, one of the greatest timeless examples of how cinema can truly enthrall and inspire people, even those who do not necessarily believe in art.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
What the hell was so great about this movie?,"First of all, I'll give you that the movie was visually spectacular. Yeah, great visuals, great CGI. I'll even give you that Crowe and Phoenix acted well in the movie.

But it had no meaning. So what if his family was killed. Did anyone feel the pain outside of those stupid dream clips which is basically Ridley Scott's futile attempt to make you think about it? These characters were two dimensional. Maximus was the low-key uber-fighter. Phoenix's character was the ultimate evil. There was absolutely no story outside of who is Maximus going to fight next. Pro-wrestling offers more of a storyline.Hey, this was a good action flick, I'd even say a great action flick. But that's all it was. This movie, IN NO WAY WHATSOEVER (IMO), separated itself from any other action flick outside of the level of visual detail and perhaps superior acting.What bothers me is that this movie will probably beat out much better movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Traffic, and Wonderboys for best movie of 2000, according to the ""experts"" at the Oscars.

Such viewers would be perfect public at the Colisseum where the final struggle takes place. The movie is a rather poor remake of ""Fall of the Roman Empire"", a movie which was not memorable but which had some point to it, for it showed the way in which the Northern blonde people were shamelessly butchered which provoked the reaction which was to seal the fate of Rome. That movie had a more elaborate story and showed how a system can go wrong. There is a worrying trend in these epic remakes such as Gladiator, The Passion of the Christ and to a much lesser extent Troy (Troy is actually quite a good movie) for gratuitous violence and no real message, no real humanity or depth.

"A massive epic, Ridley Scott's work of art - Simply a masterpiece","""Gladiator"" is, to me, one of the best films ever made, probably even in my personal Top 10 Movies of All Time -list. It's a massive epic motion picture that pleases your eyes and ears with effective visuality, drama, romance and more. The story tells about a Roman general Maximus who gets betrayed by an evil prince. By the acts of the prince, Maximus's family gets murdered and he wanders into sorrow where tears won't be spared. He then finds himself captured to become a gladiator among other slaves, but he still seeks for revenge. Maximus tries to keep himself alive in battles which he is forced into, only that he might someday take his revenge against the evil prince. The story has so much more in it, but I'll just leave the rest of it for the viewers, as I certainly do not want to give away any spoilers.Like I already said, the story is simply fantastic. It's so deep and touching, being very original at the same time. Despite of the movie being a massive epic one it still isn't clich√© at all, it just maintains the level of drama in a level that doesn't go over the top. It has a nice flow too and there is no boring scene in any part of the movie, every scene matters and every scene is significant in its own way, that's just how incredible the storytelling is. The building of the main character, the whole theme from victorious to sad, from sad to anger and from anger to a satisfying ending, everything goes like it's supposed to. The creation of the world has been achieved terrificly well; The sets, the dressing, all the details, basically everything. Although there was a lot of CGI used in the creation of the world, the CGI department deserves a big plus on making everything so believable and realistic. Everything looks smooth and soothing, just the way you want it to look like. You can't complain, really.What comes to role performances, well, in my opinion Russell Crowe does an absolutely phenomenal role performance as Maximus. The anger, the sorrow, all the expressions and body language, just great. I don't care if Crowe is an asshole in real life, because whatever they say in the press he still is an amazing actor. He has actually become one of my favourite actors because of his past role performances, he is just everything a director wants from an actor, performing every role flawlessly. He does have that sort of a rough appearance, but he can play a nice guy too. What comes to other role performances there is one more to mention; Joaquin Phoenix. To be honest, I've never liked Phoenix that much, don't know why, but I have to admit that he is too an amazing actor. As the evil prince Commodus he is that brilliant fierce himself again, a perfect actor for an evil role.This is by far Ridley Scott's best film yet to date and when Hans Zimmer's music is put on top of the cake you just can't go wrong with that. The directing is superb and the music is magnificent. Like mentioned above the directing consists of mixtures of genres; Drama, romance, adventure and action. Every department is handled in superior way, in a way that leaves your notebook blank on the side of the faults the movie would suffer from. The music has this main theme in it, which is beautifully composed, including that beauty and also thrill and intensity. ""Gladiator"" is all in all a tremendous motion picture which everyone should see, a born legend some could say. Fantastic story, phenomenal role performance by the lead actor, superb directing and beautiful music; All this compile a film that I can't imagine to be a disappointment to anyone, a definite 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Great acting, great battle scene's, great music, great costumes, great movie!","I have heard many people refer to this movie as a ""Braveheart"" rip-off or as a movie that tried to make some cash out of the success of ""Braveheart"". I don't think that's completely fair. Sure there are some similarities but ""Gladiator"" is original enough with an own unique style.The movie has a very good unique atmosphere like we are used from Ridley Scott movies. Visually the movie looks wonderful (with the exception of a few fake looking background shots of Rome). Especially the battle scene's (the gladiator fights in particular) are filmed in a wonderful way with some good editing and are something you have never seen before. You can almost feel the tension and fear and smell the sweat of the gladiators when they are entering the arena.The acting is top class! Russell Crowe is a great leading man but was his role Oscar worthy? I don't think so, he deserved an Oscar more for his role in ""A Beautiful Mind"". Joaquin Phoenix gives an impressive performance and the same goes for Richard Harris, Oliver Reed and yes, Spencer Treat Clark that shows his talent.What makes the movie even more complete is the excellent musical score by Hans Zimmer and the great looking costumes and epic settings and feeling.But no the movie is not perfect. The story at times is messy and at times it loses it's speed. It feels like it's just a lame excuse to fill up the scene's between the gladiator fights. Also some characters and moments don't feel needed at all, I don't know I can't really put my finger on it. But it's not a bad thing, the good things about the movie makes you actually forget the bad things.Worth watching if only just for the spectacular and impressive battle scene's.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Resurrection,"I haven't seen the Director's Cut yet and I have to admit, that the story really didn't capture me as much as it did with others. For once, many things that happened were so foreseeable, I was able to close my eyes, open them a few minutes later and could see what I predicted was gonna happen.While that still works for many movies, it did kind of ruin my enjoyment of the Gladiator. A movie which ""resurrected"" the Sandal movie, as was stated back then. Obviously, ten years later it's safe to say, that didn't really happen. But what made this movie so popular? For one thing, every movie that has a sort of underdog as a main character, can always be sure to get many sympathies. But that's not all! Mr. Ridley Scott shot this movie in a great way. Some symbolisms in the framing and the color scheme, being also responsible for peoples reactions.And while I did like the fight scenes and the scenery in general, the movie left me cold for the main character. I'm not completely alone with my perception of the movie (I still think that a 6/10 is pretty good), but it's more likely that you will like this and won't really think about plot points and the journey of the hero, while you watch this ... Something I couldn't do.Edit: No I watched the longer cut (wrongly called it Director's cut above as Mr. Scott would scold me for saying that earlier - it is just an extended cut) - and unlike Ridley, I actually liked the longer cut better. It added some gravitas and much needed backstory to certain things. And while the movie overall still remains predictable, the scope of it all is plain amazing. Considering the movie started while the script wasn't completely done, might even give this more things to like ... So I reckon I was maybe a bit too harsh on my initial rating (almost everyone I did watch it with fell asleep though), but the rating now is for the rewatch.I still think that other movies (be it the old Spartacus or the newer TV show Spartacus to name a few) did it better ... but considering my love for Sandal movies as a kid, I should have seen the love that was put into this. No matter how easy to decipher and the cliches that were put in. And the fun Russell Crowe had on set .. the behind the scenes pranks, might give you a new view and love for this as well I reckon.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Absolutely Amazing,"This film is a masterpiece. I would type just that but IMDb requires ten lines so I guess I will say a few words. The film revolves around Maxmius, a Lead General that was a great friend to the emperor. Once the Emperors son takes over, Maximus loses his rank and ends up as a gladiator. Russell Crowe is an amazing actor and it shows in this movie. The plot,acting,characters,set,props and anything else that can be named is flawless. There is non-stop excitement when watching this film whether it is a massive fight scene or a tense emotional one. I was on the edge of my seat and it is absolutely breathtaking.And yes Maximus, I am entertained.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Another Ridley Scott masterpiece,"There is very little fault one can find in this film. It is the story of Maximus, a roman general who is betrayed by the son of his Caesar. After escaping execution, Maximus ends up fighting as a gladiator, with an eye for vengeance. Russell Crowe is magnificent in this role. He brings such poise and humility to the character, it is impossible not to be sympathetic. Joaquin Phoenix is equally as excellent in his role, and the polar opposite of Maximus. I would not only recommend this movie, but I would further insist that you watch the director's cut. It comes in at just under three hours of run time, but it will certainly not feel like it. I would put this in my top 10 movies you should see before you die list.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"A great action movie, though not a great movie","Well oil me up and call me a Roman, Gladiator was a most enjoyable action movie. The plot was actually non-trivial, Russell Crowe had a wonderful screen presence, and the violent action scenes we well shot and were genuinely exciting.However, don't mistake this movie for Great Cinema. It isn't. This is a Hollywood-spawned crowd-pleaser, a ""Roller coaster of a movie"" that will ""have you on the edge of your seat."" While the plot was non-trivial as I said, it had few surprises and is not particularly interesting, though it did its job of wrapping the action scenes extremely well. The characters also do their jobs; unfortunately, without much flair. I would rate the thinness of the characters as this movie's worst flaw; the bad guy is wholly bad (they even make him a sexual deviant to drive the point home). The good guy is wholly good - plenty of reinforcing the ""loves his family"" angle to show what a wholesome fellow he is. The other slaves are eloquent, good-natured, stoic, and dignified. If you were sold into slavery, beaten, starved and then told to be hacked into little pieces for the amusement of others, would you be so likeable? Me neither. The wise emperor, the faithful servant, and anyone else you care to name, are cardboard cutouts.So, don't miss this one at the cinema. A most pleasing way to while away a couple of hours. I just wouldn't expect to see anyone quoting it in a year's time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A Ridley Scott Masterclass,"Scott reinvents the epic genre with a vengeance. Sharp script, haunting music, spectacular cinematography, but the acting is just off the scale. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix demonstrate what it means for an actor to lose themselves in their role. They become Maximus and Commodus to the extent that you forget who the actors are as you watch. The multi-Oscared Streeps and Day Lewis' of the thespian universe please note how it's done. We don't want to see you in your roles but the characters you are supposed to play. Connie Nielsen was born to play the role of the Roman matron. Both in bearing and demeanor she is the most authentic Roman noble born woman since Sian Phillips' Livia in the BBC series I, Claudius. Harris and Reed give incredibly nuanced turns, but it's hard to name single actor who first do a spectacular job. I fell in love with Djimon Hounsou here...the editing must get an honourable mention. It balanced the overlapping narrative threads with such clarity the viewer is always in the know.
Why is it a masterclass movie? Because you don't need to know a thing about the Roman Empire to fully get into the story and meaning of the movie. That's the hallmark of any great work of art: it gives the viewer all the parameters they need to make sense of it, without looking for contextual support outside the work.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
OLD HOLLYWOOD MEETS NEW HOLLYWOOD,"The great thing about GLADIATOR is the way in which the film combines elements of the classic Hollywood epic with a modern style. It is both respectful of the tradition  to which it belongs,  and bold enough to step in a new direction. It is not simply a remake of FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE (though outwardly the story is virtually the same), but a combination of all the great Roman epics that graced the screen during the fifties and sixties. You have the gladiator school from SPARTACUS, the horrors of the Colosseum from QUO VADIS, the burning conflict between two former allies from BEN HUR, and countless other references to what we have seen before. But, as well as being an example of solid  golden Hollywood storytelling the film is stylistically very much of the age. The epic as a genre invariably stretched the scope of film-making, being at the forefront of the latest technical innovations -be they in colour development, sound, format (eg. CinemaScope) or, as with GLADIATOR, computer-generated imagery. But at the heart of any epic is the conflict between (usually) two opposing forces, represented by two characters. And no matter how fine the effects, the art direction and the staging, it is this conflict that must grab our attention. In GLADIATOR, the characters of Commodus and Maximus represent the two opposing forces of insecurity and stability. The dynamics of this conflict, so wonderfully presented by Joaquin Phoenix and Russell Crowe, are classical in form, though with many ambiguities and cadences that make their conflict far more than a simple battle between good and bad. It is in this aspect that GLADIATOR takes a bold step in using classic Hollywood tradition (goodie versus baddie) to unravel and show the complexities of its characters and their dilemmas. This is a successful strategy because the film holds our interest throughout because of the psychology of the protagonists as much as the grandeur of the staging. Simply big is never enough -there has to be a very identifiable human conflict for the film to be personal too. GLADIATOR is both epic and personal.The film boasts a number of fine performances. Carrying on the Hollywood convention of having English actors play Romans is an echo of past epics -a reverent ploy. Joaquin Phoenix, though American, speaks with a British accent too ..Roman emporers in Hollywood films invariably did so! Such details give a sense of nostalgia, or at least recognition -always a key factor in genre films. Another example of genre convention is the ""bad but loveable"" supporting character, in this case played by Oliver Reed. He is an instant reminder of the sheikh in BEN HUR or Peter Ustinov's character in SPARTACUS, and serves the same purpose.The effects are fortunately never allowed to get before the conflict of the story, but one cannot write about GLADIATOR without mentioning them. I have always been sceptical of computer generated imagery, and I think there is still some way to go before I believe ""totally"" what I see on screen, but GLADIATOR shows a historical accuracy both in the battle scenes and in those in the Colosseum, which can only be commended. I only wish the film had been made and presented in 70mm, for if ever a picture in recent years demanded it, then it was this.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

The best. Simple as that.,"I will start off by declaring that, IMO, this is the best film I've ever seen.Why? Well, the reasons are many. First up, the acting is superb. All the major players put in excellent turns, as do the bit-part actors. Russell Crowe will never inhabit another character the way he does Maximus. He looks like he was born to play this part. He presents us a man with immense charisma, authority, bravery, honour and dignity. A man prepared to die for what is right. Joaquin Phoenix gives us an emperor, Commodus, that is entirely credible: one minute, he's reasonable and lucid, the next, he is psychotic. Oliver Reed, in his final role, is an excellent lanista (director of a gladiator school). Connie Nielsen, as Commodus' sister and would-be lover of Maximus, has to run the gauntlet of Commodus' psychotic behaviour to preserve her's and her son's lives. All in all, top notch acting all-round. They're given a great story and script to work with, too.The cinematography is magnificent. The colours the dust, great camera angles, judicious cutting around scenes. It works to create intense images that place the actors firmly in the forefront. The digital recreation of roses is amazing and you have to look very hard to detect the digital effects. Ridley Scott has produced one of his greatest directing achievements.Finally, the music, from Hans Zimmer, is magnificent. It supports the action and moods of the scenes expertly, without ever intruding too much, which is the mark, IMO, of a great score and soundtrack.If you have not seen this movie, or bought the Blu-Ray, I have only one question: why not? This is a MUST WATCH movie. Simple as that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

garbage,"Its too bad this film has such a loyal fanbase right now, because it is a complete waste of time and film.  This film was made to appeal to the Academy, but actually had nothing special in it except for maybe its budget. Russell Crowe is terrible, and I don't know when everyone will realize it. He can play one character and one character only, that being the smart-alec dead-pan monotone type.  I liked him in The Insider because that was the first movie I saw him in.  His acting style suited the part very well.  Then I saw Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind and realized how bad he actually is. His characters are all the same and never allow the audience to see any emotion, and don't allow us to buy into his characters' motivations. Russell Crowe wasn't the only terrible one however.  I don't think a single character was likable or even remotely interesting.  This film is just another example of a good plot that was ruined by the actors and director. Its too bad the Academy only focuses on domestic gross and a movie's ability to look ""cool"".

The conflict between Phoenix and Crowe for the approval/authority of the father figure (at least on Phoenix's side) parallels very closely with that of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford in the earlier film.

"Lots of action, but little else...","Overall, Gladiator rates a 7 out of 10 for me.Russell Crowe, one of the best lead actors of our day, gives a thoughtful performance and lends the role of Maximus a depth it almost doesn't deserve. Joaquin Phoenix is a revelation - when the credits began to roll, I looked for the name of the unknown British actor who gave the role of the Emperor true believability, and I was surprised to see Joaquin's name. The rest of the supporting cast, including Oliver Reed and Richard Harris, were excellent. Unfortunately Connie Nielsen's portrayal of the Emperor's sister failed to hit the right notes.The effects are astounding, and the recreation of the Colliseum in Rome is awe-inspiring. My favorite scenes, however, were viewing the ""skyline"" of Rome itself from afar-- I don't think I've ever seen it so realistically portrayed-- I felt as if I were there.My main complaints lie in the movie's length (overly long at 2:30 and draggy in some parts) and the ""choppiness"" of the action scenes. At the beginning, that fast-action/slow motion technique DOES make you feel as if you are one of the warriors, but its repeated use eventually makes you a little nauseated. As a result, you come away from the movie not remembering what you really saw in the action scenes.The opening battle scene could have been called ""Saving Private Maximus"". And much of the repeated head-chopping reminds one of ""Braveheart"". But ""Gladiator"" doesn't live up to those superior films because it lacks the realism of Ryan's battle scenes, and the emotion of Braveheart.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"If you are not entertained by this movie, then something must be wrong.","Gladiator is one of my favorite movies of all time. It has epic battle scenes, phenomenal acting, and an outstanding script with great dialogue and directing. Many might see this movie just because of the great action scenes with the battles that take place in the Colosseum. There is nothing wrong with that. That's the reason I watched it and rewatched it many times when I was younger. I'm 31 years old now, and I haven't seen this movie in a few years now. I'm going to the cinema tonight to watch Gladiator 2, so another rewatch was due.The score is fantastic and has one of the best and greatest anthems of all time. Russell Crowe is perfect in his role as Maximus, and so is Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus. The battles are well made and the cinematography is just excellent from director Ridley Scott.Gladiator is so much more than just epic battles. It's a glorious story about one man. A general, a husband, a father. A man fighting for what is right. For loyalty. For justice. For freedom. For revenge. The general who became a slave. The slave who became a gladiator. The gladiator who defied an emperor. And then finally became the savior of Rome. Maximus Decimus Meridius.All of this is what makes this movie reach epic proportions.

Where was Clint Eastwood or Charles Bronson???...Russell Crowe's gaze could melt an iceberg...,"While viewing GLADIATOR and seeing how the ""revenge"" theme was carried to the fullest, I kept expecting to see Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson riding in on their horses to avenge the killing of Russell Crowe's family as they did in so many westerns.I have to give the film itself a mixed review--and mostly for technical reasons. First, I thought the performances were all splendid. Russell Crowe's intent gaze could melt an iceberg and he uses this intensity to add power to his portrayal. Believe me, it works. Joaquin Phoenix is so good that he should have won the Supporting Role Oscar for his work. He was spine-chilling as the villainous Commodus, pitted against his arch enemy Maximus. Great acting by both men. The battle scenes were excessively gory with buckets of blood gushing everywhere--on a grand scale befitting an epic but perhaps an indication that today's sensibilities are more than blurred.On the technical side, I don't understand all these comments about the photography. The color took on a distinctly murky look for much of the film, both interiors and exteriors. It made me wonder what kind of color stock was being used to get this muddy effect. Was it intentional? Take a look at the technicolor epics of the '40s and '50s where there was such great color contrast and brilliance in the color. I was very disappointed in the color photography. No need for it to be so dark. Perhaps on a large theater screen this wasn't as much a fault.Another thing--much of the dialog was muttered in soft tones that could not overcome the background music. A good dialog director should have coached the players to enunciate words more clearly. This is a fault that occurs throughout the film and is very distracting--and no, I'm not hard of hearing at all, thank you.Aside from those two quibbles, length was another factor that should have been solved with better editing. There are dull stretches where the dialog goes on much too long to make a point about character development.Definitely not a perfect film and not particularly Oscar worthy although I'm impressed by the performances. While SPARTACUS was a much more interesting look at gladiators, perhaps GLADIATOR was meant to be the thinking man's film about Ancient Rome. It just misses the mark.Russell Crowe's intense style of acting and Joaquin Phoenix's strikingly vivid villain made GLADIATOR work for me.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"As his character commands legions, does Russel Crowe command his audience","In a spectacular historical drama such as Gladiator, the acting must be on the same scale or the whole thing becomes comical.  Russel Crowe brings brings a style that portrayed a character of heroic proportions while at the same time making him accessible to the average person.  Crowe has a approach to this role, as he did in ""The Insiders""  that shows the human foibles of his characters without making them look weak or pathetic, but rather human and vulnerable.  This makes the character look all the more heroic in their pursuit of the quest, their meeting of the challenge. A hero is all the more appealing when he disposes of a truly despicable adversary.  Meeting the challenge to provide the evil, in this tale of good over evil, is Joaquin Phoenix.  This guy gave us a totally corrupt and spineless adversary from frame one.  Playing the power hungry, selfish, insecure, lying and witless, son of the Emperor, who kills his own father to gain power and then tries to seduce his own sister to satisfy his warped desires, Joaguin succeeds handily at turning the audience to the side of the out manned and helpless hero. All of this played out on the stage and setting of ancient Roman Empire. The action scenes were spectacular and well thought out.  The costuming was interesting, but I think not accurate historically.  Except for a couple of incidences of scenery players, guards and line soldiers, chewing gum, I felt that Director Ridly Scott did a good job of taking us back to a time when there was only one ball game in town, The Roman Empire.It reminds us that while world conflict takes nasty turns and is fraught with danger from the unknown and unknowable, it is equally dangerous to put all of the power into the hands of the few for the convenience of peace.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

What else Can explain allowing leading lady Connie Nielson sleepwalk through her performance for two thirds of the Movie?  What else can explain carefully crafting a subplot involving a German Shepherd dog, then abruptly dropping it?  The ineptitude goes on and on.  The lack of chemistry between Crowe and Nielson is bad enough without further undercutting it with obtrusive, inappropriate music in early key scenes.  High- and low-key cinematography is intermixed without any concern for dramatic appropriateness.  It is almost as though Scott said, `Cloudy day? No problem, the audience won't notice.'  And lets talk about this cinematography.  Many of the low-key interiors with Joaqin Phoenix and Connie Nielson are so poorly lit, you cannot see Phoenix's eyes!  Poor Phoenix, probably the least experienced of the leads, has the toughest role.  Despite what you may hear, Phoenix does pretty well, despite Scott's undercutting.  ACTION FANS BE WARNED. Scott shoots ALL the action scenes without benefit of long shot (for perspective) and with computer generated and slow-motion action.  Think widescreen movie being shown in television (3:4) format.  Expect to be more confused than entertained.There IS plenty to like in GLADIATOR.  The late Oliver Reed as the gladiator owner is magnificent.  Richard Harris is very good as Marcus Aurelius.

I give the directors and actors a fair shot, a benefit of the doubt even in those I'm skeptical of, and I want them to pull me in. I want them to astonish me. Take me into a world I don't know, and make it hit hard. Move my emotions.Give me scenery, a stage of an ancient world, and perfect it so that I feel like I'm there. Then, give me a hero and a villain, give me an arc of the hero, and let me know their soul. Entertain me, but keep it smart.As fictional as a world may be, or as fictional as a story may be based on a real world in this case, make the characters' motives and emotions as real, raw, relatable, and justified as in modern times, or any time for that matter, and make them believable through great acting. Suck me in to this world, and keep me engaged. Make me feel like I'm watching a great movie, deliver the drama and climaxes.Gladiator is 100% pure movie. It's a spectacle. It gives you just about everything you can ask for in a film experience. It's a modern epic woven together in a way few films of the century have been.""Are you not entertained?"" Maximus yells to the audience. Thanks, we are. This is a real movie. It's the best Best Picture winner of the 21st Century so far.Only negative is: I just wished it had a better ending, but I've learned to accept it through the years.Recommendation: It gets better on multiple watches.

Superb in all departments. Russell Crowe you're a star!,"Believe all the hype,the film IS amazing in all aspects. The battle scenes (particularly the one fought in Germania) is one of the greatest EVER filmed.The gladiator arena scenes are bloody, brutal yet extremely well choreographed.Crowe shows why he should be instantly propelled onto the A List of leading men. His performance as the vengeful underdog/hero General Maximus is the perfect blend of strength, humanity and courage.Laurels aplenty also for the underrated (but not for long) Joaquin Phoenix who plays the villainous,troubled and love-starved Commodus, the beautiful Connie Nielsen and a fitting film finale for the late Oliver Reed (one of his greatest performances.)The SFX featuring old Rome are just SPECTACULAR.The towering Colosseum filled with spectators is just breathtaking, particularly when the camera does the 360 degree pan.A fine film making feat for Mr. Ridley Scott.

"Good, but not great!","This was a very well-made film with great acting and an interesting story. Yet I left the theatre disappointed. There was just something missing in this grand epic. Maybe character development?I would have loved to see the early years of Maximus and Commodus. Why is Maximus so beloved by the emperor - because he is a brave, honourable man? Why does he have such a low opinion of his own son? The fact that Maximus is the emperor's favourite is just a given. The reasons for that are never explored - we are simply told that that's how it is. So we never know why Commodus is who and what he is. In that sense I find the story to be just too simple.That doesn't mean it isn't worth watching. It just didn't grab me as much as I thought it would. Maybe it's a case of too high expectations!6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
This movie does not hold up.,"I remember seeing this 20 years ago and enjoying it, but there were some things that bothered me about it. First and foremost, I thought the CGI was very cartoonish and took away from the scene. 2nd, everyone know Commodus was as frail as most college age kids in 2021, yet they didn't overthrow him no matter how asinine his orders were. Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight.I watched the movie again today 20 years later and yeah, it just doesn't hold up. It seems to me the number one priority was to showcase new technologies that were available back then rather than build a better story.It's not a horrible movie, it's just a forgettable one.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Spectacular,"A movie like Gladiator is extremely rare and the concept involved does raise some question marks. However, the movie is so well made and so brilliant that it makes this one of the greatest movies ever made in history. Joaquin Phoenix's acting is absolutely amazing and brilliant and I'm surprised that he gets little mention and is often overshadowed by Russel Crowe. Joaquin Phoenix is certainly one of the most underrated actors of all time. The special effects are brilliant and the gore depicted so realistically that the violent is impactful yet not disturbing. The only minor nitpick about this epic is how Commodus is so easily hated by all and maximus gets so much support and backing so easily.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"Crowe, Scott shine in mesmerizing epic of revenge","By far the best movie of this year and best action-packed epic since Braveheart, Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" shines from the start to finish. In fact, this movie is so mesmerizing that it's worth the price of admission to just go and look at the beautiful images. Gladiator, however, also features excellent performances (especially Crowe), a great script, and action-packed, fast-paced battle sequences. These battle scenes are very exciting including an opening Saving Private Ryan-esqe style forest battle and several unique gladiator fights. Yet, the movie's success goes to 2 people: Russell Crowe, who will probably be nominated again for an oscar, as the tough, rough, and seriously ticked off general/gladiator Maximus and Ridley Scott, who returns to great form after average movies like GI Jane. So see this movie when it comes out, as it deserves to be seen at least once on the Big Screen.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Extremely Disappointing...,"This has to be one of the most disappointing films I've seen in awhile. I'm a huge fan of Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe, unfortunately their collaboration on this film resulted in an extremely boring film with drab cinematography and no heart. I will admit the opening battle scene is pretty impressive, and all the other battle scenes are above average. Everything in between is mind numbingly boring, the plot was like something out of the Street Fighter games I played as a kid.With an epic film of such scope like this I expected at least some nice cinematography, but it was dark, and uninteresting. The CGI collisium was equally disappointing, it looked like a model out of a computer game and like Roger Ebert pointed out, the fans in the stands were blurry. Ben-Hur or Spartacus were a lot better at giving you that feeling of being in acienct Rome and just sucking you into their world, this movie left me feeling distant from everything that was happening on screen.Although Russell Crowe gives a respectable performance as Maximus, all the characters were uninteresting. I didn't feel anything for any of them and when the emperor was finally killed I was just happy the movie was almost over. If the relationship between Maximus and his family had been more fleshed out I might've felt some more sympathy for him, but when he kissed commodus' sister, all sympathy i had for him disappeared.I think one of the reasons the movie is so popular might have to do with the fact that although there are long boring scenes, you quickly forget about them when people start getting their heads chopped off. It's unfortunate when a movie like this comes out and immediately catapults up to #59 on the user top 250 when films like The Thin Red Line aren't even on the list. Go rent Spartacus for a better film set in ancient Rome.**/***** 2 stars out of five",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"An exciting hack and slash movie, but little else","Billed as an epic (and certainly long enough to be one), Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" had me anxiously waiting for its release for almost 3 months. Imagine -- Spartacus meets the modern movie techno-wizardry!  The potential was enormous.The opening scene, with its hundreds, if not thousands, of soldiers, overwhelmed me by its sheer magnitude.  Scott captures the fear, bloodiness, and brutality of war while at the same time, embuing Gen. Maximus (Russell Crowe) with an amazing gift for leadership.  The repulsive beauty of violence has rarely been captured as well on film.Though the action scenes were amazing, the plot left me wanting more.  The superb acting by Joaquin Phoenix as Emperor Commodius was skillfully complemented by Connie Nelson's Lucilla, conveying to us their tension-filled relationship.  However, the basic premise of paternal neglect begetting cruelty never truly sells.  Kudos to Phoenix for valiantly trying to rescue this crucial plot weakness with his acting skill.Crowe remains, throughout the movie, nobly removed from the rest of humanity.  This is both his strength and weakness, as his relationship with Lucilla was unconvincing.  Though both actors were great individually, their on-screen chemistry never truly smoldered.  Not enough attention was paid to their history and I left the movie wanting more.""Gladiator"" begins on a strong note but fails to capitalize.  If you're looking for a great modern epic, stick to ""Braveheart"" or ""Saving Private Ryan.""

Roman way of life displayed in the movie is quite believable. It is a long way from old peplum movies which didn't care much for historical accuracy.

These two are the men's men and Gladiator is a movie about rising and falling and rising and falling again but with dignity and passion. Another standout is Joaquin Phoenix who played the conniving, power-hungry, incapable, brutal, unpopular emperor who killed his father for the throne and framed Maximus and killed his wife and son for it.

An Amazing Epic!,"Ridley Scott demonstrated his excellent directorial skills in this epic movie.  Opening with a wonderfully choreographed battle scene, Scott manages to integrate the personal strife of Maximus with the exciting action sequences, all set with the political backdrop of late-Empire Rome.Of course, when talking about Gladiator, one cannot ignore the powerful performance of Russell Crowe as General Maximus - 'Gladiator'.  His icy stare, bold delivery, and convincing stunts and fight sequences made him a deserving winner of the Oscar in 2000.

Fantastic Ridley Scott,"As Steven Spielberg, Ridley Scott rose during the seventies with two masterpieces: DUELLISTS and ALIEN. Spielberg, JAWS, DUEL, ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND.... Both were then rather young to bring such jewels. Scott is ten years older than his ""opponent"" but both have in common to continue, after all those decades, to provide regularely other masterpieces, and both have made around 30-35 movies, and for both of them - again- NAPOLEON film for Scott and mini series for Spielberg are also in their calendar. So GLADIATOR is a milestone for the sword and sandal - peplum - genre. Because the last ones were the Italian - and some American - productions from the early sixties, and as far as I know, there were not since. It was a kind of films totally forgotten from the bulk of audiences; but not the die hard movie goers, of course. This movie is unique, awesome, outstanding and opened the way, a boulevard, to many others: TROY,300, ALEXANDRE being the most widely known. The new, young audiences then discovered what their elders loved when they - youngest - were not even born. Ridley Scott resurrected the sword and sandal film genre with this one. And many sequences - particularely the hand of Russel Crowe touching the wheat field, was taken in at least one hundred other films and even commercials. Scott came from commercials business, during the seventies. Maybe this explains that.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A Visual Stunner and Nice Escape on a Hot Summer day.,"First the good, I finally got to see what the big deal about the Roman Empire was.  When you read it in books and see it in pictures it doesn't have the same punch as when it becomes a living breathing thing as it does in Gladiator.  Russel Crowe is great as Maximus and Phoenix makes Commodus the biggest wussy in recent cinema.  Overall, I give a big yippie-yahoo to Gladiator for a nice escape from whatever you are escaping from.  My only complaint?  It was just a wee bit long and the drama-love story aspect of it just was a bit of a letdown.  How long did it take Maximus to get from Germania to his house anyway?

Rambo of Rome,"As a fan of Peplum films (or Sword & Sandal) and having enjoyed previous films from Ridley Scott, I was surprised by how disappointing GLADIATOR was.The first thing that stood out is how badly shot it was. The DP (and Scott) missed the boat on this one. The film's constant greyish tone was off putting and uninspired. It tries to give the film a realistic look but comes across as forced and in the end more fake than anything else. Because the look of the film wasn't believable, the film's other weaknesses stood out even more, like the acting. Except for Joaquin and the veteran cast, the acting was sub-par. Crowe is monotonous, almost sleepwalking through the entire epic. He can't really be blamed as his character is as one dimensional as possible. He acts like a robot, an unstoppable robot who kills everyone in sight. In one scene, Maximus enters the stadium grounds and proceeds to kill a dozen other gladiators, one after the other, in a single run. The scene is so ludicrous that the reality of the film flew out the window and couldn't get into the predictable story with Maximus reduced to a Roman version of Rambo.The monotonous look of the film also can't camouflage the obvious CGI which today looks even more cardboady than it did 9 years ago.To make things even more tedious, the entire film is a direct rip-off of Anthony Mann's THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, which, albeit wasn't great but at least it respected the intelligence of its audience, unlike GLADIATOR which is the fast food version of history. All of this could have been overlooked had the film been entertaining on some level but the slow pace, ponderous tone and predictable story killed all possibilities for it being entertaining. It's not a fun film at all.In the end, GLADIATOR, which won the Oscar for best picture (it must have been a really bad year), is not even remotely memorable in any way shape or form.

What We Do In Life Echoes In Eternity; don't you just love that?,"Well, where to begin? I must say that I've always been an ancient history buff and I was into war-gaming when I was a teenager and into my early twenties. So, I had to do some reading about ancient warfare tactics and what have you. Now, the opening battle scene was a delight. It really gave me perspective on why the Roman army was so superior to most other armies of the time. Historically, the Romans relied on heavy artillery as a first hit and continued until the armies clashed. By then, their foes where already exhausted scared to death. This opening scene really made me see it happen.That said, now let's talk about the movie. It was so entertaining. I was genuinely pleased throughout the whole movie. It was visually dazzling, well acted and all in all just plain lovely.So why didn't I give it a ten? The story was just not 100% convincing however entertaining the movie was. But although I found the young Caesar's story slightly unbelievable, it did in a way reflect the lunacy that the rulers of the era where famous for.A word about the actors: they all played their parts exceedingly well and all the parts suited them perfectly.

This movie kicked my butt!,"""Gladiator"" is a very simple story. Most of the time, it is a typical war hero adventure. Sometimes it even appears stupid. The plot is not very complex and gets repetitive. The hero kills because he must and that is enough reason for him. He wants to avenge the death of his wife and his kid so he will plow through his enemies until he gets to the man responsible. When he does, he will save the day and all will be well. There are a bunch of other war adventure cliches in between the major plot events. Normally, no matter how compelling the story is, a simple war film will not win me over 100 percent. Although ""Gladiator"" is very one-dimensional and predictable at times, it surpasses other similar movies. Many elements contributed to grasp my attention and have me surrender to this adventure.As I said the story is simple. General Maximus (Russell Crowe) has just led Rome to yet another victory and the empire has expanded once again. The Caesar, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), is a dying man doubting what he has achieved for his people. Since he has such a close bond with his general he decides to change his mind and ask Maximus to become the next Caesar instead of Marcus Aurelius' incompetent son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). Maximus is a simple warrior that only wants one thing: to go home. He knows the exact number of days he has not seen his family. Although he loves Marcus Aurelius, he cannot imagine himself as the next leader of Rome. For that reason, Marcus Aurelius wants him to take over and bring happiness back to the people. As Maximus ponders whether to accept the offer, Commodus finds out about his father's decision. He is heart-broken and jealous and in his rage he murders his father. Quickly he announces himself as the next Caesar. Because Maximus is suspicious and not willing to serve his new leader, Commodus has him arrested and orders an execution. Similarly, he orders Maximus' family to be killed as well. While Maximus escapes, his loved ones are murdered and his house is burned down. The exiled general is eventually captured and bought by Proximo (Oliver Reed) who trains him and many others to be gladiators in a smaller province outside of Rome. Maximus quickly steals the hearts of many spectators and becomes their favorite. Back in Rome, the power hungry Commodus decides to bring gladiator games back to the people of Rome and so a confrontation between the young Caesar and Maximus is evident.Ridley Scott's direction sells this story. He uses dark lighting and vast settings to create a similar tone to the one in ""Blade Runner."" The darker mood is great in ""Gladiator."" Not all hero adventures such as this one have to maintain a mostly positive atmosphere. The storytelling is overwhelmingly powerful and very compelling. Dynamic cinematography is effectively used during all major battles and gladiator fights. The music is excellent. It just screams out at you. This simple tale is transformed into the most interesting and engaging picture of this year. Russell Crowe is great as Maximus. He portrays courage, honor, and anger with a warrior's mentality. His repetitive drive for vengeance is forgotten in the way this film is presented. Joaquin Phoenix is even better as Commodus. This is a confused man that wants power, but doesn't know how to get it or what to do with it. He expresses jealousy in sight of anyone who is more loved than he is. That is why he hates Maximus. He believes his father loved Maximus more than he loved him. He wants to feel love from the people of Rome; therefore he will do anything to please them. He wants to be loved by his sister, more than a sister should love her brother. He forces these things and they confuse him. Commodus is in pain and is blind to what he is doing. Ridley Scott makes sure Commodus' eyes are never quite visible in the film. They are always encircled by darkness or make-up. This is exactly the type of character that would be present in the future world of ""Blade Runner."" Phoenix's performance is Oscar worthy.Because of the performances, the beautiful music, the dark lighting, and the energetic cinematography the simple story of ""Gladiator"" evolves into an overpowering film. It's good to see a film set in a darker moodier ancient Rome instead of another World War II epic. It's also great to see a movie with so much energy and power that it makes you forget about its simple storyline. Many beautiful sequences in ""Gladiator"" make this film an unbelievable experience. It is tremendous and seems larger than life. ""Gladiator"" is better than, say, ""Braveheart"" simply because of its raw power. ""Braveheart"" was a great adventure that just wasn't enough in comparison. ""Gladiator"" is exceptional and surpasses other smarter films in the genre simply because of its overwhelming presence! It will absorb you with all its might. This film might be overlooked during the Oscars because it is another war epic, but hopefully it will get some recognition. ""Gladiator"" achieves greatness in its dark powerful storytelling and great direction by Ridley Scott. It will be one of the best films of the year. Thank you for making a predictable story burst out as if it was so much more. This movie kicks ass! Overall, a 10 out of 10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Now We Are Free,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator stands as an unparalleled work of cinema. Its status is legendary, offering a cinematic journey that effortlessly lifts you from your seat, plunging you into an indescribable immersive experience. Each scene unfolds with a lifelike quality, creating one of the most captivating films in existence. It weaves a connection to the essence of life, death, and profound meanings, all set against the harsh backdrop of ancient Rome, infusing an additional layer of significance. The film transports its audience to a dreamlike yet historically authentic realm, a manifestation of pure poetry where the unforgettable soundtrack lingers in the recesses of memory. In terms of narrative simplicity, the plot and story arc maintain an unwavering straightforwardness-an approach embraced by both Scott and Russell Crowe. ""What we do in life echoes in eternity,"" a powerful line that resonates emotionally, underlining the film's enduring impact.Crowe's portrayal of Maximus is not only aspirational for men but also alluring to women. As Maximus confronts life's challenges and emotional trials, the audience stands by him, urging him toward his revenge-filled destiny. Crowe's performance, rewarded with the Academy Award for Best Actor, is impeccable, capturing every nuance of pain with superb precision. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a preening villainy as Commodus, while Connie Nielsen's grace as Lucilla and Oliver Reed's dual performance as Proximo add spicy and superb dimensions. Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi, David Hemmings, and Djimon Hounso contribute outstanding performances.The dialogue is both literate and poetic, featuring speeches that have become iconic. Action permeates the film without compromising the development of well-rounded characters. The flaming arrows and bloodletting in the conflict in Germania set the stage with pulse-raising clarity, and the gladiator arena fights keep the audience on the edge of their seats. The recreation of the Battle of Carthage is a stunning piece of action sequence construction, leading to a finale that resonates with a resounding thunderclap, marking the culmination of two men's destinies.Gladiator stands as a true masterpiece. Maximus Decimus Meridius earns a resounding bravo. Bold as it may be, labeling Gladiator as one of the finest films of a generation is entirely justified. Every element aligns seamlessly, from the phenomenal storyline that captivates throughout the runtime to the incredible visuals, an epic masterpiece for both the eyes and the soul. The acting is top-notch, achieving the ultimate goal of moving the audience profoundly. In just a few words, Gladiator is amazing, incredible, simply flawless and absolutely immortal.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
I didn't bother to see this movie sooner because...,"Frankly, I had seen enough blood guts and gore, after that ridiculous portrayal of Joan of Arc. I think if I had of watched it when released I would've not been in a frame of mind to comment with any intelligence.Maximus, as portrayed by Russ, is somewhat of a complex character. Deeply loyal to his Emperor,( Richard Harris) Stirling performance.. with a sense of true dignity, and leadership. He is, the complete opposite of Joaquin Phoenix, and that is what makes this movie so very compelling. One is a total Monster, ( brilliant performance by Phoenix) and the other by contrast A Genteel Warrior. I could care less about the rest of the props, support cast etc, except those gorgeous cats, Maximus ( Crowie) just draws you in, IMHO and that's the thing that makes movies watchable, enjoyable and plausible, whether based on fact or fiction. I gave it a NINE vote, only because...I was annoyed that he died. :):)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Another Curious Best Picture Winner,"""Gladiator"" is a special effects tour de force that tries to combine the major elements of ""Ben-Hur"" and ""Braveheart"" but fails to generate the interest, intensity, or intelligence of either of those films. Military General Russell Crowe (Oscar-winning) is going to take over the throne of Rome when ruler Richard Harris passes away. Son Joaquin Phoenix (Oscar-nominated) finds out and takes matters into his own hands (literally). Crowe is to be killed, but he escapes and becomes a slave. His family has also been slaughtered in the venture. Crowe is then bought by the wise Oliver Reed and learns that the coliseum is to reopen with gladiator games. Now he is a gladiator and he wins over the country and continues his plans to get revenge on Phoenix. ""Gladiator"" is definitely a good-looking film and it is well-made. The costume designs, editing, special effects, and direction are all exceptional. However, the screenplay is nothing special. It has been done dozens of times before in better films. All the performers seem overwhelmed by the production as well. Crowe does admirably, but his part is not very complicated at all. His Oscar win is a bit strange. Connie Nielsen, Richard Harris, Djimon Hounsou, and the late Oliver Reed are all disappointing. Joaquin Phoenix is excellent though with his laid-back, but sometimes over-the-top performance. He is the spark that the film desperately had to have. The incestuous and deviant sexual under-tones do nothing to help out the film and end up being an unnecessary distraction. Overall a good film, but ""Traffic"" should have won the Best Picture Oscar in 2000. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
kind of like an imax film,"Good graphics, good gore special effects, awesome decapitations.  About an hour and a half of useless boring talking head crap that should've been cut or infused with decent writing.  Semi-interesting but ultimately flat story. Reminded me of ""Payback"" (Mel Gibson takes on the mob) minus the humour. This guy was UNSTOPPABLE.. I mean, why didn't he just take on the whole Roman army himself?  Totally unbelievable.The special effects are awesome, the fight scenes are stylistic masterpieces.  I have been to Rome however, I have seen the Coliseum, and I don't think it would ever look quite so ""gold"".  Actually, everything looks ""gold"" in this film, giving the film a somewhat tacky commercial sheen.  I wish he'd done something a little more rough around the edges like Spielberg did in Saving Private Ryan.  The one dimensional story never approaches the emotional impact of Kubrick's ""I am Spartacus"" climax either.Still, I must admit that this would make for a very nice Imax experience. The set design is impeccable and the background detail is meticulous.  If you ever fantasized about visiting ancient Rome, this is as good as it gets.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Only a flesh wound,"Gladiator isn't a great film by any means, but it isn't nearly as bad as some reviews would suggest. Sure, it depends mainly on big budget spectacle and production design to achieve its effect, but it's surprising how far big budget spectacle can take you.I disagree with those who say that Russell Crowe was more or less interchangeable with any other Hollywood action star in the main role. I thought his basic persona - the strong yet vulnerable man carrying deep hurts - was quite well used in this film, and his performance and Connie Nielsen's lent a semblance of human interest to a script that didn't give them much to work with. The film's ability to build human drama isn't helped by its failure to provide a credible villain: it's obvious from the beginning that Commodus is no more going to be a match for Maximus than Frank Burns was for Hawkeye and B.J.Some people have also criticized the film for its gratuitous violence, but I'm not sure if I go along with that either. If you are going to make a gladiator movie, you might as well go for broke. As a number of commentators have pointed out, we go to gladiator movies for pretty much the same reason as the Romans went to the Colosseum. To see blood.Having said all that, I don't think the film was particularly well made. The film seems if anything to get less spectacular as it goes along, and what should be a series of climactic sequences at the end come across as hurried and confused. There are also rather too many places where the film is unintentionally comic. There's the film's odd notion that the Roman ruling classes all spoke in upper-class British accents. Then there are what look like odd borrowings from, or maybe misplaced tributes to, other films: the American Beauty-style falling petals, or the slow-motion battle sequences, which looked elegiacal in Kurosawa but seem Pythonesque here. Actually, even Maximus' name struck me as Pythonesque - I kept wondering whether his first name was Naughtius, and whether he had a friend called Biggus. Perhaps Naughtius Maximus would be an apt nickname for Russell Crowe in real life.Once or twice the film does hint at higher ambitions. It touches on the theme of Commodus', Gracchus' and Maximus' relationships with the public, and the potential was there for the film to be a very original type of political thriller - something that would have given point to all those crowd scenes and all those power plays. But that theme isn't developed. In the end, Gladiator is not that kind of film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Boring and Over rated,"Okay maybe a 2 out of 10 is a bit harsh but it can make up for the ridiculous ratings of 10 out of 10. This movie was nothing new. It wasn't gripping, or interesting, or factual, it was just boring, I was waiting for it to get kicking all the time. I decided to watch it because of the high ratings and I remember quite enjoying Ben Herr and Spartacus but all this filmed seemed to be was lots of long beautifully filmed shots of the scenery. The fight scenes were good but didn't help make the film any more interesting. The acting was good, but didn't help make the plot any better.

Violent, epic warfare was displayed greatly, there was the battle with the big guy with the nice helmet which I enjoyed the most.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A fascinating picture of ancient Rome.,"""Gladiator"" is Ridley Scott's attempt at a sword-and-sandal epic, with Russell Crowe at the helm as Maximus. And it doesn't disappoint. The picture is beautiful, Scott pulls out all the stops with scenery, costumes, weapons, and (the most important) faces. This is a country who is recovering from brutal wars against the Germanic tribes who are, at this time, trying to take down this vast kingdom.Maximus (Russell Crowe) is an instant fan-favorite. There is no growing up for this strapping military genius, he already knows his stuff. All we have to do is sit back and watch him do business. He outwits the antagonist to the point where he is in control (to understand this feet is to understand a Gladiator's position in the Roman caste). The villain, Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) plays a pathetic and sadistic young man who, much in the fashion of Macbeth, descends into darkness and uses violent means to achieve a position that was supposedly taken from him.""Gladiator"" is worth seeing. The only complaint I give is the watering down of the characters who are devoid of any complexity, Ridley Scott tries too hard to distinguish who's who. He doesn't let the viewer decide. He might as well have his characters yell out, ""Hate me! I just killed a good guy!"" It would have been nice to see Maximus show a little of his darker side to the audience. A man who is a victim of a tyrannical dictator, a man who suffered the hanging and burning of his son and wife is not made of complete honor and integrity. At least not in reality.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Gladiator rocks my socks,"For fear of somehow being misunderstood, I wanted to make something quite clear before I get started: this movie is awesome.Yes this movie has spectacular special effects, yes this movie has amazing battle sequences, and yes this movie has a riveting soundtrack. But that's only the beginning of how incredible this movie is. The problem is that most historical epics would be happy to stop at that and be like ""oh, well at least he's wearing sandals and we have cool fight scenes."" Nuh uh not here.Gladiator features an amazing cast. Joaquin Phoenix is incredible as Commodus, and makes a fairly obscure historical figure very 3 dimensional: Commodus is one of the greatest baddies in recent memory. Richard Harris is outstanding as Marcus Aurelius, and everybody else does a great job as well. Last but not least, is Russell Crowe. This guy can act. And what is amazing is that he's awesome in this movie but he's even better in other movies. He's not just a one note guy. He's such a good actor that he can say scarcely anything for about 20 minutes in a movie and still get people to understand what he's doing/thinking (as there is a point in this movie which is similar).The script is also excellent. As far as sword and sandals epics go, most are content with articulate set pieces and large scale battle scenes (huzzah!) but lack sorely in a decent screenplay soaked with character development (hissss...) Gladiator is not this way. Instead of merely trying to work around battle scenes and try to uncover a plot, it works the other way around, and the battle sequences must work around the story line. So not only is Gladiator an able action flick, but it is also an ancient political thriller.Now that I've got that out of the way, let me go back to the battle scenes, because they are just amazing. A combined effort of superb editing, heart-pounding musical cues, and great cinematography create several amazing sequences. Especially the scenes in the Colossium. I still sit there and think ""holy crap, how did they do that?"" Any movie lover should watch Gladiator. There is a reason it won 5 academy awards. It's not just a testosterone-pumped action flick, but a quite intelligent story and does not insult your mind.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Movie Review and Style,"A General who is tired of war wants nothing more than to be with his family; a wife and a son in Spain. His name is Maximus (Russell Crowe). Since Emperor Marcus Aurelius became the Caesar, General Maximus has been at his loyal command. He has sworn his utmost allegiance to Emperor Marcus who trusts -- not even his own son, Commodus, the rightful heir -- the general to lead Rome. To take his place as Caesar. It was soon after this conversation that Emperor Marcus is announced dead. Commodus explains to Maximus that it was of ""natural causes,"" when in truth it was he, Commodus, that killed the emperor. Having caught wind of the concursion between father and general, Commodus arranged for General Maximus to be disposed of -- permanently.After escaping the secret execution, Maximus rides home to only find his farmland and family burnt and crucified. In complete distraught and sadness, he faints and is picked up by a slave caravan and is taken to Zucchabar, where he begins his new battles, not as a general, but as a slave.This movie has many qualities that makes it a ""complete"" movie. It has a story, as simple as it may be, that is moving and full of action, conspiracy, and beautiful filming techniques. In terms of slavery, this movie does a pretty darn good job at representing the most intriguing form of Roman slavery. Gladiators.In Roman history, a lot of times slaves were picked up due to abandonment, such as children with no guardians. Maximus was picked up and became a slave. With the Romans, which the movie portrayed, anyone that was a slave was equal in slavery means. In other words, their prices did not vary due to skin color or race. All slaves had an equal price, unless certain arrangements were made, such as doubling the price of gladiators.What I found interesting was the idea of winning over the crowed will get your freedom. When Maximus completed his first alone fight, he yelled at the spectators, ""Are you not entertained?"" This caught the attention of a man. He would tell the ex-general how to be a gladiator and earn his freedom. He could not kill quickly. He had to win the crowed. He had to get the people on his side for ""the mob is Rome.""Throughout the movie there is various spiritual references. An example being when one of the slaves wishes good luck to Maximus for ""red is god's color."" We also see that Maximus has visions of going to meet his family in the afterlife or Elysium. This might have been meant for a form of foreshadowing.There are many positive takes from this movie in forms of character and vengeance. Right away we know the Maximus is a man of honor. He is incorruptible. Turning down a life of riches and fame because it is not his beliefs and violates any and all of his principles. Also let us not forget the fact that with the lesson of good and evil, Commodus gets a rude awakening.Lucille, Commodus's sister, knew Maximus from the past. She paid him a visit before his next time in the arena. They were conversing about the power of Rome when Maximus exclaimed, ""I am a slave. What possible difference can I make?"" I found this a little disturbing. He has gone all this way to fight and become a gladiator to seek his vengeance, and then he makes a comment like this. It sounds as if he has given up. Lucille assures him he can. That he will change Rome. He will bring the greatness that Rome has envisioned for so long. He did. Maximus brought honor to the city. It made the people see a true warrior. A true soldier. Maximus has struck the hearts of many for he was General that was brought down to a slave and became an honorable gladiator that changed the fate of Rome.No matter what. Slave or not. Anyone can make a difference. Anyone can change something if they so desired. Their hearts and minds have to be set and then just then will they achieve something of greatness.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

A very good movie - in spite of its grand spectacle style,"Gladiator is 2 1/2 hours long and I watched it in two parts. I agree completely with ""gregatory"" (another reviewer - see that review) in most respects.Russel Crowe is clearly one of the greatest actors alive today. His role here is nothing short of that. Also the description of the almost impossibly gory battle scene in the beginning (as well as the gladiator scenes later), could be trivial blood and gore performances. But they are not. It is clear how brutal these things were, but the craft the the producers use to portray them makes them sensible and tolerable. What we see is the horror of war - even before anybody had a gun or cannon or bomb.Frankly, I was put off by the performance of Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus. He played a despicable and weak, palsied man so well it seemed his acting was equally bad. It annoyed me and I almost panned the movie for that. But I believe that was a personal bias. Apparently the role was just that - awful, the man was awful, that is.The second part (for me) fit together with the plot and was quite credible. Still the movie lacked something to make it absolutely great. It was also somewhat predictable - not an ingenious plot.So I rate it as very very good (8 points) but not great. As I mentioned though, Russel Crowe is great. I think, like Clint Eastwood, he is typecasting himself. His role and performance does remind me of Capt. Jack Aubrey in Master and Commander.He is definitely the Commander.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Incredible.....a must see.,"As a huge fan of Braveheart, I must admit my skepticism before I saw the sneak preview of Gladiator tonight.  I was expecting a derivative action/adventure flick; decent, but not spectacular.  What I got was an amazing film...an epic of Braveheart proportions, not a cheap rip-off as I had expected.  Needless to say, my feelings going into the movie were dead wrong...it was terrific.  Russel Crowe was a strong and believable hero, and he has certainly become one of today's premier leading men. The casting and costumes were superb, and the story was simple yet powerful.  I don't want to give anything away, as the movie has not yet been released in theaters, but I will say that  this is a must see for any movie fan.

A special film for one odd reason...,"Detractors claim this film is a hollow entry in the Roman gladiator genre for the most pedantic of reasons. Nothing could be further from the truth. This film is one of the greatest ever made because it has the power to move people, specifically myself. I don't mean just move me in the same way that Robocop or the Star Wars saga move me by making me see aspects of my past and how I would ideally change them. I mean that Gladiator moves me by making me look at the details of a life that was, and still is to some extent, slowly dragging me down and making me abandon life altogether, and motivating me to make a commitment in the way I deal with it.That commitment? Like Maximus, I realised that I am not ready for my life to be over until I have made something more of it. Maximus could not die until he had transcended the way in which Commodus had victimized him, and liberated Rome from Commodus' inferiority complex that masqueraded as a dictatorship. As I saw this unfold on the screen in front of me, I took the death of my fiancee and the abuse of my past and saw that the future was not set, and I could still make my life something worth living.This alone justifies Gladiator's place in the 250 best films of all time, in spite of its relatively miniscule flaws. Before I die, I want to shake Russell Crowe's hand. His performance as Maximus reduced me to a tearful wreck, and at the same time moved me to do something nothing else could move me to do: let go and move on. I will always owe Crowe and Scott a huge debt for this film, which means more to me than any film I have seen before (more than five thousand, so don't bother arguing with me about it) or probably will in the future.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

The female character is pure window dressing, the effects are poor but thankfully used sparingly.The period armour and weapons are all wrong. The tacked-on ""going home"" racial liberation bit at the end is pure hokum.

A must-see movie,"I have never written a review before but thought that it would be nice since I saw a sneak preview of this movie last Tuesday... This movie was spectacular.

No one knows that Marcus Aurellius wanted Maximus to take over, so Commodus does and proceeds to try to execute Maximus. He sent out men to kill him, but didn't realize he wasn't slain. He also killed Maximus's family. Maximus is found and becomes a slave. All he can think of, though, is how to get revenge on Commodus. This movie is brilliantly acted and gets 9 stars by me. The beginning of this movie is a war against barbarians and is not too graphic. I would have rated it PG-13 if it wasn't for the small amounts of gore.

A spectacular epic with a not-so-spectacular script,The action scenes are spectacular. Men wearing bizarre costumes and armed with inventive weapons try to slash and dice each other.

Uneven and Pretentious,"Ouch. This was the first DVD I ever purchased, and the first I gave to the local thrift store.First of all, I was subjected to Richard Harris all too much at the beginning, and what was that all about? How did that contribute to the film? Film is all about compression of characters and more-or-less smooth progression through the story. I'd have left the Richard Harris part on the cutting room floor. To present ""the wrong person is on the throne"" can be done very effectively in many other (shorter) ways.Second of all, Joaquin Phoenix's character was wholly one-dimensional, the result of which was a uniformly downward-feeling mood. Think of Stephen Boyd in Wyler's Ben Hur. Of course, Gladiator was a kind of remake of that one, which was a remake of a really good one. I now better appreciate Francis X Bushman.And what was the dog all about? I get all that Roman Valhalla stuff, but the execution was pretty corny, all dreamy and, can I say it, cheap. And let me digress - Richard Harris's part in Caviezel's Count of Monte Cristo might better have been left 60% on the cutting room floor. It gave the same problem, taking time and focus from the meat of the story.Gladiator was a one-and-done for me.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Possibly my favourite movie of all time.,"There are thousands of reviews about this film. Some critics love it, others do not. Some are indifferent.So what can be said about it that has not been said before? Not a lot really. But what I can say is that any film that can create so many opinions and discussions has got to be worth watching to find out what all the fuss is about.People will talk about the performances of the actors, the dialogue, the cinematography and hundreds of other in-depth subjects. But for the laymen such as myself, what do you get from this movie? Well firstly, the movie excites you with the action of the battles, then angers you with injustice of the new emperor. Then you feel the pain of our hero and his despair at the futility of his new existence. Then you are brought back with him as he once again takes control. The power, the invincibility. You feel euphoric as you sense that revenge is near...but then.... Every emotion you can think of is summoned in this movie. A clich√© I know, but it is a roller coaster!!

To that end, he has invaded, relying upon the leadership and valor of his best general, Maximus (Russell Crowe), to win the day.

Six Years Later and Still the Best,"'Gladiator' was the movie that proved that sword-and-sandal epics were still economically viable, leading the way for 'Troy', 'Alexander', and 'Kingdom of Heaven'. It remains the best of the bunch, a near miracle considering that half of it was written well into production and one of the leads (Oliver Reed) died half way through filming.The screenplay displays none of the usual problems usually associated with multiple writers and battling egos. It is structurally sound, admirably balancing action with drama, and the characters are all well rounded, complex and believable. Scott proves once again that he is one of the best director's around when it comes to 'action with a heart', and his vision of 2nd century Roman Europe is beautifully extended by flawless CGI that achieves exactly what it should while never drawing attention to itself. Arthur Max and Janty Yates, regular Scott collaborators, do an excellent job of bringing a warts-and-all grittiness and realism to the movie. Though the designs aren't that authentic (Imperial interiors were rarely all-black!), they play a large part in ridding the genre of the traditional toga-party kitsch.The leads are excellent. It's to be expected that Richard Harris and Derek Jacobi can do this stuff in their sleep, and Djimon Hounsou has been playing the same role of proud and stoic nobility, albeit very well, ever since 'Amistad'. But Joaquin Pheonix, in his first real adult role, somehow manages to make a sympathetic character out of what amounts to a murdering, incestuous sociopath, and with all due respect to Benecio del Toro, the Oscar that year should have belonged to Pheonix. Russell Crowe, for all his off-screen nonsense, is able to consistently deliver such natural performances that he completely inhabits his characters and was fully deserving of his Oscar win.'Gladiator' is an excellent movie ¬ñ a textbook example of how these kinds of movies SHOULD be done. It's a shame that the subsequent sword-and-sandal movies haven't come close to the quality of this movie. 'Gladiator' remains the benchmark and it will be a long time before it is surpassed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

The cinematography was great, and Joaquin Phoenix as the Caesar was excellent(which should have won him an Oscar), but of course Crowe won for an ok performance as best actor.  The film was directed well by Scott, but our appeal to the characters was lacking as opposed to a similar Oscar winner in ""Braveheart"" in that it had a lot of violence but Gibson was wonderfully captivating where Crowe was again just ok.  It seems like Oscar always tends to like a overly-produced epic know matter how good it is these days.  I hope that it returns to simple storytelling for it's best picture winners (aka.

Great,"Gladiator is a more modern take on the sword and sandal Roman period epics like Ben Hur and Spartacus. With a big budget and Ridley Scott at the helm, Gladiator is high powered entertainment. Epic in scope with a huge cast and great f/x, this is a marvel to look at and was put together well. A great mix of drama and action with political schemes and battle scenes. The acting was very good all around with character actors like Oliver Reed and Richard Harris. Joaquin Phoenix was a good antagonist and Russel Crowe gave a commanding presence as the lead delivering a powerful performance that won him a richly deserved Oscar for best actor. I remember seeing this at the theater and it completely blew away Mel Gibson's weak attempt to relive the glory of Braveheart with the failed(and very lame) epic The Patriot. Gladiator comes really close to being as good as Braveheart and at times is also very bloody. Gladiator is also bloody good and is well put together all around. This is in my opinion one of Ridley Scott's finest works and like most of his films, stands the test of time and holds up really well.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

It Coulda been a Contendah!,"Overhyped!Gladiator is perhaps the most frustrating movie that I have ever seen. Expecting either an action-adventure popcorn movie, or Braveheart 2 I sat down with baited breath.  However, the opening battle scene was completely uninteresting except for the special effects firepower.  Then the movie slinks into a long series of poorly written scenes that serve no thematic purpose (no matter how much they pretend to) but are only there to forward the plot.  I was almost entering REM sleep when the movie shocked me awake with something very strange, a well-written scene.  Once Crowe is sold into slavery, we finally get some movie magic working.  Oliver Reed and Djimon Honsou enter with well written characters and powerful screen presences. Strangeley Crowe's, Phoenix's, and Nielson's characters suddenly become more interesting as does the plot.  The battles begin to have meaning, as does every word.  I exstatically awaited the ending... only to see the writing go back to hell and end in a poorly handled, overly simplitic, and flat out bad ending.  In 3 hours I saw a bad pseudo-epic turn into the next braveheart, only to give way to an ending only found in a bad action movie.  The acting is fine, Crowe is a commanding screen presence and can bring dignity even the most horrible of lines.  Reed's performance is gripping and wonderful, as is honsou in a very small role.  Nielson is dignified and beautiful, Phoenix's characterization oscillates as much as his role does, but he is effectively complex and twisted.

His loss of will to live makes him an east target for slavers and he is soon sold as a gladiator. He fights his way into the coliseum in Rome were he wins over the crowd and uses his celebrity status to defy the Emperor, to whom he swears his vengeance for the death of his family, after many battles and political backstabbing he gets his chance to fight the Emperor in the Arena.This is just such an amazing film, it captures every emotion possible in only the way an expert director can achieve, we can go on for whole scenes without the need for speaking, everything is told through the genuine body language and expressions. And when there is conversing we get such emotion and wonderfully powerful quotes - ""What we do in life, echoes in eternity"" Wow.The opening scene is spellbinding, showing the true gore of battle, the fight scenes are marvellously realistic, discarding the popular ""pretty"" sword fighting for brutal aggressive force. The audience in the arena express every emotion, surprise, anger, and enjoyment. The cast is brilliantly chosen; we can really see Russell Crowe as a gladiator, in Commodus, Joaquin Phoenix gives us a man we can really hate, Connie Nielson shows real emotion and passion in the role of Lucilla. So apart from the spellbinding acting, scarily realistic fight scenes and the amazing script, what else can we look for? The music is just stunning, its exactly what we need brought in at exactly the right time, truly wonderful directing. And then we have the stunning special effects, we can really visualise the greatness that is Rome, the fight scenes really make you believe.

Cant be Beaten,"This has to be the best film i have ever seen and in my opinion has ever been made. I have never seen a film quite like it. At first i thought it was just going to be a one of those blood thirsty over the top films , how wrong could i be . It had me gripped all the way through ,i could not take my eyes of the screen once. It has everything i like in a film it has action so it doesnt get you bored it has a hearty element so that you can walk away from watching the film and feel like you were somehow part of it and it is one of those film that makes you want to see it twice because you dont quite beleive what you have just seen.What really compliments this film is the colliseum scenes which were to me so enjoyable it is a action packed thrill ride all the way . Russell Crowe does a fabulous job as Maximus , i am glad he was given the role instead of mel gibson because i dont thing gibson could of done the part right. As always his acting was of high quality and was worthy of the praise it was given.He definitely looked the part and has never made a roman warrior look quite so handsome. Joaquin Phoenix is also a fabulous actor and handled the role as comedos really well putting alot of feeling into his performance , he deserved to have gotten a best supporting actor oscar for the performance. Connie Neilson looked the part and was another great element to the film , i feel her acting was underated as she was the only women i think who could have carried of that role as superbly as she did and she was another one of the films great attributes that should have done better at award ceremonies. Most of the praise for this film should go to ridley scott who as always made an incredible film that hollywood should be proud of.

"Sorry Russell, Mel beat ya to it!","Welcome to Braveheart, the Prequel! The similarities to Braveheart are*uncanny*! In fact, the only real differences between this and Braveheart (aside from the time period) are that Braveheart has a better script, more clever dialogue, better acting, far less horribly cheezy melodrama, and *much* less spit and polish. In fact, Gladiator is *so* polished that most of it looks *beyond* fake! The tigers were so obviously CGI'd that you could see the superimposition most of the time. And the squibs were obvious as well.And the melodrama!! Don't get me started on the melodrama!!! Braveheart should've cut the last 10 minutes you say? Gladiator should have cut the last half hour! Horribly cheezy death scenes followed by some of the worst schlock I've *ever* seen. His buddy burying his little figures as he meets his dead wife and child in the recurring wheat field dream-zone. I feel *something* rising inside of me, but believe me it's not tears...Phoenix was awful and unconvincing (he should watch a few of his late brother's films to learn a couple of things about acting...) and Russell Crowe is so far behind his role in LA Confidential that he's barely worth mentioning...which is frightening, because save for the always fabulous Oliver Reed's too small role, Crowe was actually a standout.Ridley, Ridley, Ridley, what are we to do with you?? First White Squall, now this??? Come one now! And get over the lightning already!! And the pacing!!! OUCH!!

And most of those slow-paced scenes dragged on *way* too long...Admittedly, *some* of the cinematography and sets were amazing (as is usual for Ridley Scott) but most was much less than I'd expect from one of the greatest scenic directors in modern cinematic history. Even aside from all of the hype, this film needed to chop off at least 30-40 minutes, ease up on the too-special special effects and get itself a decent cast. Oscar my butt! My advice?

"Pretty good, but this overrated historical epic lacks heart.","""Gladiator"" has a lot to commend it: Awesome fight scenes in the Coliseum, haunting images, and fine (albeit brief) supporting turns by Oliver Reed and Derek Jacobi.  But it's ultimately a three-character movie (Maximus, Lucilla, and Commodfus)and none of those three characters are all that interesting. The ending should be devastating in terms of emotional content, but it just lacks the heart of earlier Roman epics like ""Spartacus"" and even ""Quo Vadis"".  And, despite the lavish computer-generated effects, the film is sorely missing an epic scope.  Contrast Commodus's arrival in Rome with Cleo's spectacular entrance in the '63 ""Cleopatra"".  Maybe the latter film wasn't all that great either, but it captured the scale and pagentry that ""Gladiator"" misses.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Scott depicts the period as an excellent painter and the screenplay is full of beautiful sentences that remain impressed in your memory. Russell Crowe is absolutely gorgeous in the virile role of Maximus, the general/peasant/family-man who becomes a hero not only because he is an excellent soldier and leader, but mainly because of his humanity and his solidity (strength and honor! ), his principles and his moral values. Leader/manager roles suite Russell Crowe best. His voice impresses: he can roar like the tigers he fights against in the arena, but he is also able to whisper love words in the sweetest way. He definitely deserved the Oscar for this movie, certainly also for other movies like A Beautiful Mind, but especially for playing Maximus. The plot may be simple, but the study of the characters' minds and the historical period are what really matters in this movie. The actors' performance is splendid. The unrelenting, massive fight scenes can be appreciated also by a woman when they are breathtaking and are depicted like that.

An epic film like no other,"Gladiator is a great experience to the film viewer. It is a beautiful and well told story that keeps you intrigued and at the edge of your seat from start to finish. A great cast, story, visual effects and soundtrack are the right ingredients for this iconic film.The story is simply mesmerizing and beautifully told of a respected General who became a slave, who became a Gladiator, and, who then won the praise of many and defied the evil emperor. Just as the spectators in the Coliseum cheer for Maximus so does the viewer as you support his vengeance and justice. Justice against an evil Emperor who killed his family and wants to prevent a Rome governed by the people. The dream that was once Rome as envisioned by his great late father is pushed aside for his selfish wishes. The fights he organizes in the Coliseum are to distract the people as he knows too well that Rome is not the Emperor or the Senate but the mob. Little does he know that soon Maximus will return as a Gladiator to defy him and win the praise of the mob.The final moments are simply masterful. The scene showing Gladiator about to be reunited with his wife and son in the next life and him reaching out to this before he falls is probably one of the best scenes in film history. The soundtrack is simply epic and transports you easily to a time when Gladiators battled in ancient Rome. Hans Zimmer has outdone himself with his work and it works perfectly with some great scenes.Russell Crowe's Gladiator won the hearts of many in the film as I am sure this film won the hearts of many of its viewers.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A traditional matrix + the highest level of performance = An excellent motion picture.,"I have to admit that I entered my local multiplex with an endless dose of scepsis about `Gladiator' convinced that it's going to be just another popcorn entertainment project of modern Hollywood postoriginality, and it is in some way, except it's, in my opinion and my experience, a lot more. And that makes him more than just worth seeing.The creators took a traditional matrix of old Hollywood spectacles and then did one of the hardest screenwriting jobs today and that's to lay a modern superstructure on top of it, balance the pieces well, measure the chill, the drama and the romance correctly and finally construct the visual performance in a manner which stories of this magnitude deserve. The creators did all that amazingly powerful, convincing and  emotinally hammering bringing todays artistic conscience and computer techinque abilities to the borders of possible never going over the line or overdoing the performance to make it in discrepancy with the given plot. HOWEVER ...... They did a crucial job to the film's final quality by rewriting the original draft which, among other differences, had a happy end, and that's something that proves that they knew what they were doing. I was very afraid, to say at least, that it will be a conventional happy-end-movie, and was prepared for that conclusion already seeing Russell Crowe and Connie Nielsen kissing in front of the sundown in the closing shot of the film, and if the original draft wa kept in the final version of the movie I would be even more disappointed than I was preparing to be, because the film was constantly promising a lot more than that kind of conclusion. I can't express how relieved, satisfied, moved and touched I was when that didn't happen.I have to say that the intro battle in Germania and the fight between Maximus and Tiger are two of five most spectacular action sequences I've ever seen in movies, the `big fight' at the end one of the strongest finales in history, and the end altogather delivers one of the most moving conclusions in recent times, and one of the most important in history of the world, too.All actors give strong performances, I myself was especially impressed by young Joaquin Phoenix and his magnificent portrayal of Commodus - one of the most repulsive, and yet believable bad guys I have ever seen - and also by his unique ease in snapping from character in one style of performance and film to another completely different, diametrically opposite one. The performance by young actor who playes Lucius will be the unsung one, although I hold that the kid was so good and convincing in his behaviour for the period his character's in, that he deserved a lot more screen time.I was sincerely moved by the film in a lot of ways a film can get to you, and think it's a proof, more than welcome one, that Hollywood can still make great, full-blooded movies which get under your skin even without much originality or genuine artistic idealism that always heads for the development of new approaches to storytelling. Or maybe `A traditional matrix + the highest level of performance' is a way to go if a lot of new Hollywood products will have the final quality of this one. In another words: Be excellent motion pictures. Because this one certainly is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Gladiator,"A action/drama based in Rome around the time of 180 a.d. about a man named Maximus(Russell Crowe,L.A.Confidential)Who is betrayed by the emperor Commodus(Joaquin Phoenix,The Yards)the emperor of Rome.Maximus and his wife and son are to be put to death but Maximus escapes his death yet his wife and son did not so the emperor Commodus assumes Maximus is dead but that is far from the truth.The truth is that he has been captured by a slave trader who sells him to a man named Proximo(Oliver Reed)who makes him a gladiator ""The Gladiator that defied a emperor"".Russell Crowe(Maximus)Gives a electrifying performance as does Joaquin Phoenix(Commodus).Yet i found the young boy Spencer Treat Clark(Lucius)very very Annoying i cant quite say if it was his acting or the character that i found annoying maybe it was both.Ridley Scott as always flies pass the directing medium at the speed of sound.There are some extremely exciting battle sequences the gore was not out of control i really appreciate when a director can keep the gore under control now i am not saying there was no blood because there was but the way he showed the blood was quite classy.The music is extremely powerful making the movie very exciting.I really enjoyed the screenplay the actors worked very well off of each other.The storyline was very good i was only bored for a total of about 10 minutes out of the 2 hours and 35 minutes which is quite good.Best actor/actress-Russell CroweA powerful experience-Jake HydenI gave this movie a 9 out of 10Rated-(R) for intense, graphic combat9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"Pretty good movie, but far from great.","I perhaps had too high of expectations for this film. I am a big Russell Crowe fan and the hype surrounding this movie was rather positive. However, whenever you see Ridley Scott's name as director, you should have reservations. I feel that Scott is right up there with Jerry Bruckenheimer in the making of MTV video movies. The stories tend to have some style and little substance. In Gladiator you get that style, but sadly, very little substance. Although Crowe was very good, that is no great feat, Crowe is always good. The problem with this movie was the real lack of supporting players. Phoenix was rather one dimensional and Oliver Reed was dead, literally. Perhaps I am being too negative, the movie is certainly entertaining and worth the rental, but it is not Spartacus, not even close. You want to see some kick butt fighting, check it out, but there are few Oscar clips here. Perhaps I should be more complimentary, it was Ridley Scott!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Magnificent, epic, spellbinding","I didn't see this when it was originally released, what a shame, it might have replaced the dank, blandness of some insipid offerings I did see. For this is true drama, exciting, visually stunning and ultimately tear-jerking.Russell Crow, not exactly a giant of a man, who looks as if a gust of wind might play havoc with his armour, makes the title role of Maximus his own through sheer force of personality. He doesn't have to seethe with rage, a mere grimace and you know he'll do anything to avenge his wife, child and his beloved former Caesar.Joaquin Phoenix is equally brilliant as his nemesis and Connie Nielsen as Lucilla shows deep emotion, contradictory filial loyalty and warmth of character with every tear.Ridley Scott directs with verve and passion, Oliver Reed, makes Gladiatorial entrepreneurialism look quite attractive and Sir Derek Jacobi, as Senator Gracchus, is just as good as he was thirty or so years previously as Claudius in BBC's superb dramatisation of Robert Graves' 'I Claudius'.A truly unmissable film.

Overrated,"I don't live in the States, so by the time Gladiator got here, I had a fair idea of what to expect - an impressive, well acted, well directed historical spectacle. And since Russell Crowe is had impressed me in the past, I went and saw it. About five minutes in I got a strange feeling that I'll end up disagreeing with the reviews.Wow, did I ever. Let's start with the acting: inconsistent best describes it. Crowe was good, though not up to his L.A Confidential and Insider standard. Derek Jacobi and Oliver Reed turned in decent performances as well. Joaquin Pheonix overacted a bit but for the most part I thought he did an okay job. Richard Harris was ridiculous and Connie Nielsen was very pretty, but calling what she did acting would be a stretch. The kid was very annoying.Now, the other problems: Many sequences in the movie were so dark I couldn't see the actors' faces. Obviously not a good thing. Is this meant to convey the darkness of Maximus's predicament? The oppressiveness of the Roman Empire? The treachery of Commodus? I wonder...Still, the biggest problem was the screenplay. A lot of the dialog was plain silly, and I spent much of the movie wondering what motivated some of the characters. The whole thing seemed horribly one dimensional and contrived.Maybe it's just me? Well, I went with four friends, all of us with very different tastes. None of us enjoyed Gladiator, and I think my friend summed it up best when she said she was very impressed, but she doesn't think she liked it.Despite my rather negative opinion, I'm going with a 5/10 on account of the movie's better performances and some nice cinematography. But as for Crowe films, I'll take L.A Confidential any day.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Have people forgotten what a GOOD movie IS??,"I am as amazed as confused at how anyone could find this movie anything less that a masterpiece. A triumph in acting, special effects, directing, setting design, costume design, plot, dialogue, and anything else associated with movie-making.Long ago, when movies were time-spent productions, when only one movie would come out in theatres a month, when a movie earning 4 stars wasn't a rarity.. this was the time when audiences knew how good some movies could be. (Hence all the classics.) It's frightening to see today what movies have become. With 3 movies coming out each week, sometimes many more, it's hard to determine the quality from the ""merely entertaining"". Some movies have their moments. Almost every one does. A funny one-liner, a cool death scene, or a wicked plot twist. But this doesn't make up a good movie. That isn't what it's all about.What also needs to be realized, is that when someone thinks of a movie as their ""favorite movie"" or a movie that they ""hated"", they are merely saying their opinion about it, which has nothing to do with the movie itself. Obviously what one person thinks of as a great movie is not the universal definition for cinematic greatness. (I remember my brother feeling betrayed when Corky Romano wasn't nominated for an Oscar). For example: what one person may hate about a movie, another person may love about it for the exact opposite reason (An overprotective parent may hate this movie for it's violence, while if it had been cuddles a bunnies, some ""macho man"" may have hated it too.) Truly these are not grounds to be judging movies. However, there are universal traits for movies which one can rate a movie on. (Acting, story, etc.) Perhaps this is why we have award ceremonies. Because some people can't decide for themselves what good acting really is.As a serious movie lover, these are my strong opinions. I am merely trying to make sense of all the negative comments about this movie.(God I wrote a lot!)My opinion about it anyways::  In my opinion Joaquin Phoenix MADE the movie. (My FAVORITE actor!) Russell Crow was great in this type of role, but Joaquin did an AMAZING job. He was able to portray the bad guy but with soul (Something VERY difficult to do.) This was obviously overlooked however at the Oscars. The Academy must have forgotten how much easier it is to be the guy everyone loves, the ""good guy"". The story itself seems to be the reason we loved Maximus. We felt sorry for him. We wanted him to win. Whereas Joaquin was just so damn GOOD at it, you HATED Commodus within the first 5 minutes. He was so damn good at being bad. You must judge good acting NOT only by how well they preformed, but how into character, and how believable, and how 3-D their character was(not always in the actor's control), and how hard their role was to bring to life. I know this is becoming a Joaquin praise rather than a review, but I think this was the BEST I have ever seen him.BESIDES Joaquin, the MOVIE is nothing short of spectacular. A true movie is inspiring, it's good at what it does. (In this case it can make you cry for an hour after the movie's over, feel suspense, and realize that this is more than fiction which little people do.) We need to remember that this stuff really happened. Obviously being 2000 years from the time it took place, it isn't entirely accurate. But than again, when was the last time a documentary won Best Picture? Would any of YOU see a documentary with such enthusiasm? Would it have made enough money to pay for the lavish settings and costumes the crew would have to create? NO!! Which is why it is a MOVIE. Besides, for NOT being a doc, it actually IS pretty damn accurate. Almost all the characters were real -except Maximus- and the fact that Rome was/is real at all is amazing enough. The recreations of everything to the gravel is breathtaking. The sets are so beautiful and real, you feel immediately as though you are in ancient Rome. Also the corruption and insanity that was going on with the politics back then is also there. They were murdering each other left and right! (Due to the lead poisoning.)So the themes fit as well.It is also a very simple yet powerful story which any decent human being can sympathize and relate to. So in short, it really IS a good movie, not worthy of the ignorant, inane comments by some who probably couldn't tell a Shakespeare masterpiece from the Nutrition Facts on a Snickers Bar.~Rhea",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Ridley Scott's Best Film To Date,"My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****.Although Gladiator is not my favorite Ridley scott film (that title belongs to Alien), I do believe it to be his best achievement. Gladiator features things Scott has improved upon from his past movies. Gladiator features some great acting, impressive direction, and very satisfying visuals.The acting is a major strength. Russell Crowe applys himself in this role and does a very good job, he is a perfect gladiator. Connie Nielsen does an admirable job. The standout is Joaquin Phoenix, who is brilliant as Commodus, he makes the villain so deliciously evil that hes impossible to like. The supporting cast all do strong jobs too.There is a dark tone in Gladiator. Its especially evident with the scenes between Commodus and his father. Also, between him and his sister.The film also has stunning visuals. Great Sets, Good Cinematography, and Stunning Costumes. The Visual Effects are also top notch. The fight scenes are also expertly filmed. A Film with all these stunning visuals may lack a good script, but this film does not. Its script may not be its biggest strength, but it is well written. The film also features a rousing score. Gladiator pretty much remains entertaining throughout, it is a violent film but I wouldnt say its gratuitous. Gladiator is definitely worth your while to see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"An epic for the 21st Century, visually stunning and absolutely engaging.","Being lucky enough to get a pass to a preview of this film I was pleasantly surprised. I thought it would be good, but I had no idea. It was great. Russell Crowe plays Maximus, the great Roman general and right hand man to Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. As well written as the film was, Crowe delivers an excellent performance as Maximus, making it nearly impossible to imagine anyone else in the role. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a great performance himself playing Aurelius' son Commodus who assumes the role of emperor after his father's death in an underhanded manner. Phoenix's portrayal punctuates Commodus' despicable demeanor. This film transports you to the era in the theater. It's totally engaging and shot beautifully. I really loved this film and I will gladly fork over my 8 bucks when it's released. Gladiator appears to be the first great Epic of the 2000's.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Old fashioned fun.,"When I first saw GLADIATOR in the theatre, I was amazed. I hadn't seen anything like it before. When I saw it on video, I began to actually consider the film, as one always does. I found it quite different.What makes a motion picture good. The acting has to be good, the story original, the directing careful and good, the dialogue realistic, the screenplay well written, the cinematography original AND good, and entertaining.In Gladiator, the acting is great, fantastic, even. Phoenix is evil as Commodus, Harris on target as Marcus Aurelius, Nielson convincing as Commodus' sister, and seems to care for Maximus and her child. Russell Crowe amazing, being exactly what the writer and director wanted him to be: tough, caring, slightly emotionless, though, and at times funny.The story is quite original, it mixes true historical events and fictional sequences alike to create something wholly new. The pacing is perfect, and the dialogue  and screenplay are good. The sub plots are involving and one comes to care for the charcters.The cinematography tells a good story. Old fashioned camera angles are used, as well as technically impressive photographing techniques are employed in the film. The action scenes are exactly what Scott wants them to be, confusing, violent, compelling, and showing not only the common horrors of war and violence, but also those invovled's feelings and what it was like to be there in them.There is no question that Gladiator is not entertaining- it is! Old fashioned Rome stuff and today's violence, as well as involving charcters.So why not like the film? Okay, there are historical inaccuraces, but Scott doesn't want it to be real. Spartacus had inaccuraces, Ben-Hur did, too, no one is complaining of them.In addition to the above things, the art direction is beautiful, the score compelling, the costume design good (however inaccurate), and some good old Braveheart style violence.I keep thinking to myself, this film isn't that great, it doesn't even deserve a nomination, but then I think about what I tell you, and I realize it really is a great film.I have not seen Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon or Chocolat, so I can't say anything about those. However, Erin Brokovich was just awful! But I'm reviewing Gladiator here. Traffic was gret too, but I have only seen it once in  the theartre, so I have not really had a chance to truly evaluate it.In conclusion, Gladiator is an amzing film, not to be missed. I give it eight out of ten, but even now I find that I am giving it a lesser score than I think it should.

Ye gods! Spare me from a sequel....,"What a disappointment. Although I'm sure that the handicapped kid in the front row with the speak and spell board who typed repeatedly throughout the movie ""I need a hug"" and ""I want more"" added somewhat to my lack of movie-going enjoyment--I did not like this movie at all. Now I understand what scriptwriting courses mean when they say to avoid ""talking heads,"" and boy, this movie has exposition a-plenty. Long, draggy, incomprehensible exposition---anytime there isn't a fight onscreen. Plus, all of that exposition is done by predictable, cliched characters possessing as much depth as a sheet of paper. Not that the acting is bad---it wasn't. But if you've seen any entry in the ""they-killed-the-family-of-the-noble-hero-and-now-it's-payback-time"" genre, then you've already seen this movie. What's sad is that Russell Crowe is a fantastic actor, and ""Gladiator"" would have benefitted greatly from having a flawed anti-hero like his role in ""L.A. Confidential.""

I can truly understand them,why they are doing this or that. Nobody is the perfect one,the best,the infallible. That makes the characters vivid and memorable. It gave you the opportunity to feel sad or happy about them. Besides Ridley Scott knows how to make a hero of a man,who's not a saint,who has flaws.And somehow it appears to be better this way...!

Just short of a masterpiece,"This is a terrific movie which combines fantastic action, a good plot and one of the finest leading characters seen in a long time into a undeniable classic. Russell Crowe's casting as Maximus is perfect and he produces a magnificent performance as the invincible Roman General who's nobility, honour and fearless composure in all things win over everyone. He is a born leader and warrior who has only one dream: to defeat all who oppose his Emperor and to retire back to his Spanish farm with his wife and son. When those things are taken from him by the ruthless Commodus his initial welcoming of death becomes tempered as he sees a way to return vengeance upon those who have destroyed him. Ridley Scott deserves most of the congratulations as it is he who once again delivers us the kind of movie he is capable of making, beautiful, graphic but above all else utterly absorbing. The special effects and the music are amazing and serve to draw you completely into the film as its story unfolds and not once do you find yourself thinking 'Nah, that didn't look real'. If they had to complete some of Oliver Reed's scenes without the great man then the join is invisible and goes to show exactly how well the money was spent.

A Timeless Epic of Revenge and Redemption,"Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" is a cinematic triumph that has stood the test of time since its release in 2000. Starring Russell Crowe in his Oscar-winning role as Maximus Decimus Meridius, the film weaves a compelling narrative of vengeance, honor, and redemption, set against the backdrop of the Roman Empire.From the very first scene, ""Gladiator"" immerses viewers in the brutal and majestic world of ancient Rome. The film's visual grandeur is matched by its gripping storyline. Maximus, once a revered general, faces a dramatic downfall and must navigate a perilous path as a gladiator. Crowe's portrayal of Maximus is both powerful and nuanced, capturing the character's journey with remarkable depth.One of the film's greatest strengths is its ability to balance epic action sequences with intimate, character-driven moments. The gladiatorial battles in the Colosseum are thrilling and visceral, showcasing Scott's masterful direction and the incredible work of the stunt team and special effects artists. Yet, it is the quieter moments - Maximus's memories of his family, his camaraderie with fellow slaves, and his interactions with key figures in Rome - that give the film its emotional weight.The supporting cast also delivers exceptional performances. Connie Nielsen as the conflicted Lucilla, Richard Harris as the wise and weary Emperor Marcus Aurelius, and Djimon Hounsou as the loyal Juba all add depth to the story. Hans Zimmer's iconic score enhances the film's emotional impact, blending haunting melodies with rousing anthems that perfectly complement the onscreen action.""Gladiator"" is not just a tale of revenge; it is a meditation on power, loyalty, and the human spirit. Its themes resonate as strongly today as they did at the time of its release. The film's lasting legacy is a testament to its craftsmanship and the timeless appeal of its story.In conclusion, ""Gladiator"" is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates epic storytelling, memorable characters, and stunning visuals. It remains one of the finest examples of historical drama in modern cinema, and its influence can be seen in countless films and TV shows that followed. Are you not entertained? With ""Gladiator,"" the answer is a resounding yes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

One big 'meh'...,"Ay, carumba... I was looking forward to this film, as I generally like these types of films, and I was thinking it would contain some epic qualities of action, intrigue, characterization, etc. However, this was one big 'meh', and I ended up regretting the time it took to watch over a few days during my lunch hour!The picture just wasn't very exciting or interesting. There was nothing in it that I didn't expect to happen as I watched it. The characters were predictably bland. Even the fight scenes were rather ho-hum. Just a lot of bashing and blood, which is probably what it really was like, but you know, in a film, you expect some more kind of essence or drama to it. The final fight between Maximus and Commodus? Who cared, by that point? There was very little artistry or drama to something that should have been quite a powerful confrontation... I agree with Roger Ebert's review that the look of it was very dark and bland and depressing, both visually and in terms of character.What's really baffling is how this was awarded best picture of the year, and Crowe as best actor, and that what's his name playing Commodus was even nominated for an Oscar! Yikes. I mean, I suppose it may have been a weak year, and you certainly can't count on the Best Picture being the 'best picture', but you expect it to at least have something significant to it. This had very, very little to it. I think of just two years ago, when the Best Pic noms were - Shakespeare in Love, Life is Beautiful, Saving Private Ryan, Elizabeth and Thin Red Line. Every one of those movies had so much more to them than this film does. It's almost ridiculous, the difference there. Not to mention others that weren't even nominated that year, like Truman Show and Gods and Monsters...Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix (that's his name!) were both rather unspectacular, mumbling their way through their lines like David Mamet's mock GREAT ACTOR would. (It's no wonder they were rewarded so!) They just didn't really cement themselves into those roles, particularly Phoenix. I can think of several others who could have done that part, and might have been more interesting. Then again, it could have been the direction, or the script, but his character actually seemed to have some of the more interesting things to say, so that probably rules that out. And it's not so much that Crowe was bad in the part, but it just wasn't that much of a part. He fights, he looks veangeful and sad, he mumbles a few lines, he fights some more, he longs for his family, fights some more... Not all that much to dig into, really. I haven't seen The Insider or A Beautiful Mind yet, but I must imagine that there's a lot more for him to have been 'best actor' for in those characters and films.There were some little things here and there that were alright, and some of the minor characters did well, but on the whole, a pretty big waste of time to watch...-EE-",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The general who became a slave. The slave who became a gladiator. The gladiator who defied an emperor.,"Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" tells the story of a betrayed Roman general (Russell Crowe) who is thrust into the life of a gladiator. He lives for the day that he can exact revenge on the man responsible for the murder of his wife and child, the emperor himself (Joaquin Phoenix).The film harks back to the sort of big-budget historical epics that died out in the mid-sixties. Therefore, it isn't surprising that the script's strength isn't originality. The plot borrows elements of ""Ben-Hur"" & ""Spartacus"" and supposedly also draws heavily from ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"", which I haven't seen.Regardless of this lack of originality, the film does manage to present us with a compelling story of a type that had been absent from movie screens for too long. Also, with the advances in CGI, the filmmakers were able to fully realize the epic scope that such a story deserves. While the script may misstep a few times it nevertheless presents an intelligent story effectively balancing action and political intrigue.The cast is solid. Russell Crowe won an Oscar for his work here, which is a bit surprising to me. It's a good performance as far as action-oriented drama goes, but I don't think that it's outstanding by any means. I think that Joaquin Phoenix fared better as the conniving emperor but he only managed an Oscar nomination among some tough competition. The rest of the cast is generally above-average, featuring a number of talented individuals like Djimon Hounsou & Richard Harris.Ridley Scott's direction is skillfully handled and resulted in a well-deserved Oscar nomination. The attractive cinematography & crisp editing were also recognized with Oscar nominations. The visual effects deservedly won an Oscar, as did the costume design, while the art direction scored another Oscar nomination. These plaudits should make it clear that this is a film showing considerable care in all areas of visual presentation.A further Oscar nomination resulted from Hans Zimmer's score while the sound design scored another Oscar win. Very rarely do I notice sound design in a film but in this case I did.I'd say that, more than anything, the high quality of every technical aspect of the film went a long way in securing the film's Best Picture Oscar win. As for my own opinion, I think that the film represents a rare commodity: A crowd-pleasing film that also shows considerable technical prowess.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Matte Painting Festival,"Why do people think it is so good?  It was fair.  It was obviously an elaborate production but I was not overwhelmed by the set design or the action sequences.  The story was mundane.  Maximus might as well have been Moses (born to privilege, cast out by a ruler, returns to exact revenge and free a nation.)  Russell Crowe and River Joaquin Phoenix were good but no one else was. The grand scale shots of the coliseum or any part of Rome were obviously matte paintings (painfully obvious.)  I don't think I could watch it again from beginning to end, there were too many dull moments.  When fair actors speak bland lines I nod off.I did enjoy the fact that Maximus' (Maximi?) servant was played by Tommy Flanagan (big scar on his face) who's most recent other role was playing the father in ""Ratcatcher"".

STANDING OVATION! - (10 stars out of 10),"The stage curtains open ...""The General who became a Slave. The Slave who became a Gladiator. The Gladiator who defied an Emperor."" - And so begins one of the best onscreen epics to ever be filmed, featuring Russell Crowe as Maximus - the Gladiator.When a dying king chooses his General, Maximus, as the next ruler of Rome over his own son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the king is betrayed and killed by Commodus in a fit of self-pity and rage. Commodus then arranges to have both Maximus and his family killed so that he can usurp the throne. However, Maximus survives and is taken into custody as a slave and then turned into a Gladiator known only as the Spaniard. As fate would have it, his group of Gladiators find their way into Rome where Commodus has opened the Colosseum for 150 days of games - leading to the much anticipated and climatic final confrontation between the Emperor and the Gladiator who defied him.This is such a good movie. The cinematography was excellent, that coupled with the amazing soundtrack really pull you in. The story is very well crafted and acted with great skill. It is tragic, yet exhilarating - taking us to a good payoff at the end. This is a perfect film, in my opinion, with very little room (if any) for improvement. This is what movie magic is all about. A very high recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Wow! and again I say WOW!,"Every so often, a film comes along that seems to have just about everything : a compelling story, incredible acting, fine sets and costumes and music. And -Gladiator- is such a film. Russell Crowe gives an extraordinarily textured performance as the central character Maximus, a warrior-poet who chooses private life over public ambition and then finds his world turned upside down. (IMHO, Mr. Crowe should have been the winner of this year's Best Actor Oscar for his work in -The Insider- ; the performance he gives here merely serves to reinforce that conviction.) Connie Nielsen is radiant as Lucilla, daughter to the late emperor Marcus Aurelius (finely played by Richard Harris). Djimon Hounsou, Derek Jacobi, and the late Oliver Reed also deserve kudos for their performances. But it is Joaquin Phoenix whom I found the most intriguing. His Commodus is that film rarity : a ""round"" villain...if indeed that word even applies in this case. The character's motivations can be understood, and, even if the choices Commodus makes cannot be approved, at least one can sympathize with the twistedness foisted upon him that leads to such choices. Nine stars out of 10. (Be forewarned: The violence is a bit heavy-going at times...but the Romans didn't build and maintain a worldwide empire by inviting folks to a tea-party!)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"It's LONG, but Russell Crowe is AWESOME","It's long. What more needs to be said. You FEEEeeeEEelll The length of this movie and there's nothing you can do about it. Thank God for Russell Crowe or else I would've walked right out. It's actually beautifully shot and the costumes are exquisite. I've always been a sucker for armor. It's got blood and it's got war. It's got slightly interesting sub-plots and everyone in the movie is beautiful. I have to say, I was slightly impressed by the artsiness of ""dream sequences"" and the unashamed blood bath. But, too long, too draggy and there's nothing they could do about it. It had it's moment and it's memory but I'd never see it again. It's definitely a renter -- but it would be best if you had a wide-screen televison to enjoy the beauty of the filming itself. Defintely NOT an oscar contender.

Predictable melodrama,"I'd been looking forward to seeing Gladiator, since reading a review in the TIME praising it to the skies. I was disappointed - the story did not touch my heart. I think ""BraveHeart"" had a much better story and characters. I did not feel much empathy for the characters and the love story left me cold. The endless chit chat between the ""Roman"" characters was so boring with the dialogues utterly ordinary. The special effects were ok, but nothing extraordinary. Similar melodramatic stories have been seen by me ( as I from India) millions of times before. Wife, sister, parents, brother or son murdered and the hero taking his revenge. I would advise others who are praising the movies to the skies to start watching Indian movies. They will really lap it up. I also found the ending a big let down. The climax was so meek !! And I here I was expecting a big showdown between the the armies of the rebels and the emperor. Russel Crowe has acted well, but I believe any of our homegrown Indian superstars can give him a run for money in the melodramatic and action sequences. I found Joaquim Phoenix and the lady awful. The Gladiator isn't awful, but it's not particularly memorable either.

"If i had to give this movie one word it would be ""thrilling""","Compared to a lot of other war movies,this one in particular has a really good battle scene to start it all off. Though its plot isn't my favorite i would have to agree that they got every battle scene right and the character development was almost even better. But it did have me falling asleep at certain points and also reminded me of a movie my mom would watch, which doesn't make the movie bad but definitely sets it aside from other action movies. I also think the whole medieval setting makes more than a war movie too. But if i had to give this movie one word, that word would be ""thrilling"".

I was disappointed,"I heard and read that this film is a classic, and thus I expected a really great film. But it's not the case. This film has a serious lack of character development despite it lasts 2 and a half hours. Together with the character development, we can see a poor ambient development. We just see a huge coliseum and thousands of people computer-generated. Just that. We don't see closeups, we can't see the feelings involved, and we feel no empathy at all (for a good example of a well done job, see Kubrick¬¥s Spartacus). The camera moves in the fight scenes are acceptable for films like Saving Private Ryan, set in a time where cameras did exist, but not for a Romans' film... They just seem to be used to make us more difficult to find goofs, and that is a dirty trick in a so expensive movie. Another point is the acting. The actors are not bad, but they don't look like people from the 2nd century. OK, nobody knows how they were, but I am sure they weren't like people from the 20th century. I mean, the dialogue, the way they move, the feelings they show. You can use the same acting and the same music in a film set in the Middle Ages and we wouldn't note the change. If we forget that Ridley Scott is the director and Steven Spielberg is the man behind the production company, we just have a mediocre film. I still can't believe that The Sixth Sense got no oscars and American Beauty took them all. Mr. Spielberg, you are rich enough yet, so please let talented people do their thing and stop your 'This is the greatest film ever' propaganda in a Microsoft style! And you, people, please look with your own eyes and don't follow the stream. Dreamworks is making really good products, but not everything is gold...",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
MAIN EVENT,"This is the kind of film made to be seen on the big screen. It's an engaging, adventure tale for adults. The opening battle scene in Germania is on a par with 'Saving Private Ryan'.

There won't be a summer 2000 blockbuster to match this film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Entertaining with minor reservations,"I was entertained, but then I could watch Russell Crowe read the phone book. LA Times review mentioned trite dialogue in script.  I think it is a testament to the actors that none of the dialogue came off that way to me. In lesser actors then Crowe or Phoenix, the dialogue would have been awkward and full of bricks.  Script/story are full of holes but does that really matter here?  My main pet peeve was the undercranking and variable speeds in Cinematography during the battle scenes. Why?  Does it train our eyes to accept the intense digital matwork when we get to Rome?  I don't know.  It kind of got in the way of the storytelling in the battle scenes for my taste.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The work of mediocrity,"I was disappointed. I did not have high expectation, but I was taken in by the word of mouth that alleges Gladiator is a great epic akin to Ben-Hur. Sorry, but Gladiator fails to beat Ben-Hur by the distance. In fact, Ben-Hur is marginally better than Gladiator.There are problems with this film. The cinematography, however beautiful and majestic in some scenes, is murky and at times irritating -- especially the sped-up method used for chaotic effect that left me cold even in the midst of carnage (hasn't this been done already in Saving Private Ryan?). There's a lack of focused direction by Ridley Scott -- the result is too many scenes that droll on and on. I felt no empathy for the cast's stilted performance of the characters throughout the film. The editing is confounding in the heat of the major war battle and gladiator duels. Even a good performance by Russell Crowe can't save this film from being doomed to failure.I despise the flashbacks. It's the cliche that has been done to death. That's the most irritating part of the film besides that annoying and insipid young actress girl. Right in the beginning of the film after the prologue, with the main character's hand weaving through the wheat field, I knew Chuck Rudolph was right when he murmured: ""Malick be damned"". (For those who don't get the quote -- it's a sarcastic reference to Terrence Malick's 1978 Mid-Western classic ""Days of Heaven"")Although technically impressive, the movie fails to engage me in the story I find meandering and tedious. Though I wasn't bothered by gore, I find the audience's positive response to blood and carnage cynical and despicable, especially after the fact Dreamworks/Universal showed the TV spot comparing Gladiator-esque violence favorably to football and hockey.It's not a terrible movie, but it's certainly not great as the majority of the moviegoers seem to believe. Gladiator is as mediocre as Braveheart, and that's the only compliment I have for this film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
HMMM???,"I'm sorry, I found ""Gladiator"" not quite convincing. Its a mixture of ""The decline of the Roman Empire"" and ""Ben Hur"" (i.e. a story of revenge), and first of all its the personal story of Maximus. But I couldnt feel with him, this charakter remains a shadow - despite Crowes good performance. Did he love Marc Aurel (Alec Guiness gave the emperor-philosopher outstanding, Harris is not just my favorite) and his family, does he hate Commodus??? Surely, but its not on the screen. What else? Marc Aurel TOOK Commodus as Co-Emperor in 177 - but Manns movie told the same nonsense. And - nothing changed since ""Quo vadis?"" and ""The robe"" - the Emperor's conflict with the senate and ""the people"". Neither did the Roman senate representate ""the people"" nor could he offer - or even wanted it -  a ""democratic"" alternative to the regime of the emperors.I like the genre, but this movie stands not for its resurrection.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Well done but overrated !,"I was a little disappointed in this movie, what with all its Academy Award hype.  This was a good movie, well worth your time but this was not a great movie.  The story line was borrowed from a half dozen different movies depicting gladiators.  The acting was professional  but the only Academy Award performance I saw was Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius and that part was so small it had no impact on the film.  Definitely not family fare as it is very bloody from start to finish.  Preview this movie but it would become very tiring in any film library.  I rated this a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Epic that pays homage.,"The movie ""Gladiator"" filled pretty much up to my expectations. It had wonderful photography and visual effects, probably one of the most enjoyable movies to look at of the 90's. The action sequences are tense, suspenseful, gut-wrenching, slick, and above all, violent. Russel Crowe's talents, unfortunately, are somewhat wasted in this part, since primarily his part is just to fight and be brave. He does do this little well, though.The plot of this movie is reminiscent of countless other epics.  Emperor has doubts about who to give his throne to, and his unexpected decision stirs up jealousy in those not chosen (Ran). So unchosen decides to run off the one chosen and tries to kill him, though the chosen somehow survives, while the unchosen believes he is dead (though not an epic in practical sense, The Lion King, and possibly others). The chosen finds his wife and son dead and vows vengeance against the now king (Braveheart). He is instead, though, sold into slavery and enrolled in a gladiator school (Spartacus). There, he is put on display in a colosseum to compete with others for the audience's amusement (Ben-Hur). He rallies up support, but after being betrayed by his own people, he is caught by the king (Braveheart again). Then, there is an ending which I'm not quite sure what movie it is from. I must not have seen it yet. Alright, so maybe the movie is going to win any acting or writing oscars. It probably doesn't deserve them anyway. However, the scenes in the colloseum are so beautifully and skillfully crafted, that the academy still should grant ""Gladiator"" oscars for Best Director Ridley Scott, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Sound, Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Visual Effects, and maybe, just maybe, best picture. We will see.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Don't believe the hype!,"Now don't get me wrong, Gladiator is not a bad film, it simply isn't as good as everyone seems to be saying it is.  For some reason it has captured the imagination of what I call the James Bond audience, the people who only go to the movies once or twice a year and this has artificially inflated it's rating. There are plenty of other people writing about how good the film is, so I'm going to concentrate on it's flaws.Firstly, it is far too long.  Clearly the producers wanted to make an epic like in the old days, but they seemed to have assumed that epic means length.  Wrong!  I'm sure a half-decent producer could have taken at least half and hour out of the film.  It takes far too long to get going.  After the inital battle, which for me was the high-point of the film, there is no action for about 45 mins.  This is the point where the plot takes place. The problem is, the characters are all so cardboard that the audience can easily work out what the plot is about, and five minutes here would have been more than ample.The fight scenes were some of the worst I have ever seen.  You would think Ridley Scott (or his second unit director) would have seen The Matrix, a Jackie Chan film, or at least one Martial Arts film.  That is how to direct an interesting fight; long, stationary shots showing off the skills of the stuntmen, not close-ups and constant irritating cutting on movement.  It was impossible to work out what was going on in most of the fight scenes.Thirdly, there is far too much CGI.  Yes it was impressive to recreate the Coliseum, but then they ruin the effect with overkill.  And the CGI tigers were absolutely awful.  Surely real tigers would have been cheaper and far more impressive.Fourthly, historical accuracy...  oh we don't need to bother with this, after all, it's only a movie...And don't forget the wonderful array of accents!I can't help comparing the film to Ben Hur or Spartacus and I'm afraid that Gladiator comes a poor second in terms of story and spectacle.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Pure, exciting, old-fashioned entertainment","Every now and then, a film comes along with adrenaline-pumped action, first-class acting, delicious cinematography and with warm, old-fashioned storytelling charm. I believe that Gladiator is one of those films. Russell Crowe gives a memorable performance as the heroic Maximus Decimus Meridius, Joaquin Phoenix is sensually evil as the embittered, power-hungry Commodus and the late Oliver Reed gives one of his career-best turns as Maximus' idealistic trainer.The story had enough depth to compliment the action sequences and the score to the film was just sensational. One of Han Zimmer's most accomplished compositions, and one to remember with nostalgic sentiment. Connie Nielsen was also credible as Lucilla, the troubled sister of Commodus, repressed of hope by her brother's dark affections towards her. The sheer magnitude of Rome, the fight sequences in the wilderness and the battles in the amphitheatre elevate this film from the run-of-the-mill Hollywood crowd of films, and witholds a historic value to boost its credibility.I don't think its one of the best films of all time, because some of the subplots are not given the depth I would have liked, and some were given too much. The incestual relationship between Lucilla and Commodus lacked subtlety.  The ending though, is very special. I think about Maximus' ideal of heaven and I wonder how close he is to the truth.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
An Epic Movie which works quite well despite inconsistencies,"The movie works well.

Russell  Crowe surely keeps the interest for gay audiences everywhere (and my friends agree with me).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Overrated and derivative,"To give Gladiator its due, the music is good and aspects of the filming are also much above average.  Unfortunately, there is little to either the story line or the acting to understand the ridiculous comments regarding the quality of this movie.  The antagonist is reminiscent of Caligula with over-acting and a twisted personality that defies understanding where his political strength came from.  The protagonist is wooden and compares poorly to all the prior ""heroes"" of this genre. Russell Crowe manages to make Victor Mature look good which is quite an accomplishment.When you start a movie by having the aging caesar far removed from the political center of Rome decide that he will confront his perverted son and announce that the son is getting the shaft and the general is getting the glory, credibility drops like a stone.  No one but Maximus, the son and the daughter know of the plans for succession. Oh, surprise! son kills father. Son kills Maximus' family. Maximus spends the movies going through slavery, remote gladiator contests, Rome and final confrontation. If there was one clever plot element along the way, I missed it.

His character in that movie, the charismatic but terrifyingly cold leader of a gang of skinheads, is the polar opposite of the one he plays here in Gladiator.The soundtrack, insipid new age vocals, is so bad it nearly ruined the movie for me.

"Gladiator is a slightly flawed, but never the less entertaining, blockbuster.","Gladiator provided one of the very few enjoyable movie-going experiences of 2000.David H. Franzoni's screenplay is adequate. It's clich√©d and doesn't introduce any new ideas or concepts to the genre but it is still entertaining.The cast does a fairly nice job at giving life to their roles. Russell Crowe does a great at putting the human back in the hero in his role as Maximus. He does a good job at bringing ferocity and nobility to the character of Maximus. Joaquin Phoenix is pretty good as the disturbed villain, Commodus. Some of Joaquin's more emotional scenes are a little over the top and hammy, though. Oliver Reed is wonderful at bringing a hardness and edge to the character of Proximo. Connie Nielsen and Richard Harris also give commendable performances.Hans Zimmer's score is fantastic. During the battle scenes it is effectively powerful and energetic and during the more dramatic scenes it is very sorrowful and mournful.The set and costume designs in Gladiator are very good; they bring out the splendor and glory that was ancient Rome.The CGI effects are acceptable but sometimes it is evident that the images seen on the screen were generated from a computer.Ridley Scott is in top form as usual; the film carries his wonderful stylistic flare.Pietro Scalia's editing, and Scott's direction brings the grisly battle scenes to life. Scalia utilizes quick cuts for the battle scenes, which prove to be very effective.

"Worst ""Best Picture Oscar"" since ""The Last Emporer""","This movie is just such a mess, that last year must have been a worse year for movies than I'd realized.  That said, Traffic is head and shoulders in quality beyond this silly toga movie.There are little scenes in this movie that do not relate to ANYTHING - most notably, the scene near the end where someone puts a poisonous snake in a bed.  The viewers are lead to believe that a certain traitor was being killed; the set-up about Cleopatra had been made in the previous scene.  But nothing happens - the character is clearly alive later.The scenes involving war crib from the best - Rashoman and Henry V, with music stolen from Holsts' The Planets.  The gladiator scenes steal from Spartacus (with more gore, of course; Spartacus, made over 40 years ago, is a vastly superior movie despite Tony Curtis' problems with acting).  The Collesium scenes use many shots from Ben Hur.The performances are all over the place.  Richard Harris and Oliver Reed (whose ruminations on death in the movie are all the more eerie since he died during the filming) are terrific. Russell Crowe is pretty good, but not great.  His best scenes are during his general days early in the movie.  But Juanquin Phoenix and, to a degree, Connie Nielsen feel like they are in a completely different movie.Some of the photography and most of the CGI work (except when they attempted to animate a tiger) is quite good.  The animated tigers intercut with real tigers showed the CGI isn't perfect because the perspective is extremely flat when the animated tigers are used.This movie is an ambitious disappointment.  It is very much like Ben Hur in that it has flashes of brilliance but is undercut by a surprisingly awkward script.  On the whole, I'll take Ben Hur and Spartacus for great cinema about Rome.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Powerful, Herculean Filmmaking","Director Ridley Scott's Gladiator is a stunning, powerful epic that boasts some fantastic visuals, a solid story, deep characters, intense fight sequences, and bravura performances, making it very likely to grab a few Oscar nominations.  At the least, it's certainly the most entertaining film of the 2000 summer.Russel Crowe stars as General Maximus, devoted to the glory of Rome and a successful military man. When the dying Emperor decides to appoint Maximus as his successor, scheming prince Commodus (a brilliant Joaquin Phoenix) decides to do whatever it takes to assure he will be the next Caesar. Maximus escapes his clutches, but then returns to Rome as a gladiator and wants to exact revenge upon the evil emperorAs Maximus, Russel Crowe shows he is not only a great actor, but a star: Gladiator virtually secures his stature as a leading man.  His performance as Maximus is strong and emotional.  Though his acting talent was proven when he played Bud White in Curtis Hanson's atmospheric L.A. Confidential, Gladiator proves he can carry a film as a major star.  His character is also not a cardboard cutout and shows depth: the writers, thankfully, don't make Maximus a macho, indestructible killing machine and instead he shows sensitivity, devotion, power, and strength.Thankfully, the writers do not forget the villainous counterpart and also give Emperor Commodus depth , replacing what could be the usual out-and-out tyrant character with a tragic, weak, and ultimately inept ruler.  Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant as Commodus, in some scenes evoking pity for his character, only to become reviling in the next.  While Gladiator can be seen as a star vehicle for Crowe, it can also be seen as a display of the fantastic talent Joaquin Phoenix has.  His controlled, calculated performance is effectively cringe-inducing.Director Ridley Scott not only gets great performances from the entire cast, but the visual effects employed are equally stunning.  The magnificent views of Rome, the towering, hulking Collosseum, the brutal, striking battles, and intricate costumes all are used to immerse the viewer in the spectacle that was once Rome. While the story may drag a bit in a few places, the overall power is not muted one bit thanks to Scott's masterful helming of this powerful, entertaining film.9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
