The Avengers Assemble for the First Time,"It's a film that future generations will still be gushing about, much like previous generations did with such classics as Star Wars and Indiana Jones. It may not be perfect, but The Avengers lives up to its promise and delivers quite a punch. I feel The Avenger struggles as most superhero movies do with finding a way to naturally introduce its characters in a way that doesn't seem forced or formulaic. They do a decent job for what it is, but there are certain times you will feel the campiness of older works coming on as you view the film, and truly you just have to sit through it to get to the action that eventually will be at hand. Besides that though, there isn't many flaws. The acting is rather good, Samuel L. Jackson may take a line too seriously or too, but it's all in good fun. Again Tom Hiddleston as Loki is a major standout, and I also enjoyed the return of Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man and Chris Hemsworth Thor- as well as an improved performance by Chris Evans as Captain America and a great performance from replacement Hulk actor Mark Ruffalo. The action scenes are exciting and tense, there is some camera angles here and there that can be a bit annoying, but for the most part it is rather clear and not awfully tedious action- as many films of this type could be. In the end, despite its campiness and formulaic actions- The Avengers is an incredibly fun time. It takes pride in its stories and characters and makes the most out of an experience that could have easily been phoned in. Its a film that will live on for some time, and one i'm rather glad I got to experience first hand.My Rating: 9.4/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
LA Review of 'The Avengers' (No spoilers),"LA Review of 'The Avengers' (No spoilers)I was lucky enough to attend the Marvel screening of 'The Avengers' on Saturday morning in Century City, CA. This was an unusual screening as movies of this caliber are not screened some three weeks before it's release date. Just minutes before the movie started, we were all surprised when writer/director Joss Whedon walked in with Kevin Feige to introduced their little ""Justice League"" movie. Not only did we all laugh, but some booed. lol. If that wasn't enough of a surprise, the soft spoken Whedon introduced on stage Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Tom Hiddleston (Loki), Clark Gregg (Agent Coulson) and Cobie Smulders (Agent Maria Hill). Wow is she stunning in person! The audience gave them all a standing ovation with deafening cheers! (This explained why the secret service like security were searching, wanding everyone. No cameras, cell phones, nothing was allowed in.) What a nice surprise for an early Saturday morning screening.I've never read comic books. This is a comic book movie. It was made for hardcore fans of comics, and I appreciate the care Joss Whedon gives to this movie. It was very entertaining to see Tony Stark (Iron Man), Thor, Dr. Bruce Banner (Hulk), Steve Rogers (Captain America), Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow), Clint Barton (Hawkeye), Agent Maria Hill, Agent Phil Coulson and Director Nick Fury all interact with one another.Capt. Steve Rogers was fighting in WWII just yesterday. Having been recently awoken from his frozen sleep, he struggles to fit in our modern world with all this technology around us. The God of Thunder, Thor, is not from this world (realm) and doesn't understand modern technology on Earth as well. Dr. Bruce Banner has been on the run from the government, practicing medicine in third world countries. He hasn't been the Hulk in two years (What's his secret? ;). Tony Stark is still the same, playing with this high tech toys and inventing new technology. So how do you get them all to interact and play well together? Well, Director Joss Whedon is the secret to making it all work.The highlight of the film for me is how Joss Whedon has all these characters interact. Deep character development was not needed for this film. (That is what the respective movies are for: Thor, Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America: The First Avenger) He does a great job of not forcing dialogue, and the interaction of the characters is much more organic than I would have ever anticipated. That is where Whedon deserves the most credit. He took what appears to be a very silly premise, with silly looking characters and made it completely work. Seeing as the Avengers comics date back to the 1960s, you can tell he not only did his homework, but he really cares deeply for the material, and his passion definitely shows on- screen.The movie is vastly entertaining. The Action scenes are amazing and satisfying. Nobody is short changed when it comes to the fighting or action sequences. I felt as if there was not a single bad performance. A couple of dialogue lines seemed off, but once you remember who the character is, and why they talk the way they do (think of where they come from), it all makes sense. Each respective character is true and honest to itself. Each of the characters brought their personality (from their respective movie) to the table. It is by far the best Marvel movie to date.So who was my personal favorite character from the movie? Dr. Bruce Banner (played by Mark Ruffalo) of course! He is by far the BEST Bruce Banner/Hulk since Bill Bixby. His intelligence (genius) is unparalleled (greater than Tony Stark's) and his compassion for human lives is what drives the good side of his character. As a kid growing up, he was my favorite Marvel super hero. I enjoyed watching Bill Bixby play medical doctor/physicist Dr. David Banner on television. I'd watch, terrified with my hands up to my face, as he transformed into the raging green hulk. Yet i was so fascinated with him being a scientist, helping those in need. When Mark Ruffalo was first announced to play Bruce Banner, i didn't know what to think of it. I knew that he's a good actor. All he needs is the right director to get the needed on-screen character out of him. I really hope they make an Incredible Hulk movie sequel starring Mark Ruffalo as Dr. Bruce Banner. Or at least, i vote for him to reprise his role in any sequel. He was a natural fit for this role.Overall, the best thing about these characters is that they are not silly twenty-something terrible actors who were chosen for on-screen eye candy. They all do a fine job of bringing these characters to life and their chemistry together works great. Assembled, they are unstoppable. When i heard an Avengers movie was rumored to be in the works, i was ecstatic. The day has finally come. Go see it. Thrice. 10/10 Stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great Movie,I watched this movie when I was younger and it was probably my favorite marvel movie until Infinity War or Endgame. Loki was a fun villain ngl. It was when the Avengers first assembled so it's a pretty important movie. Nothing can replace it.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Can't beat the originality of uniting a superhero team! Aside from Avengers 3 and Spider-Man 2, best superhero movie ever made!","This might be controversial to say but this is my personal favorite MCU movie. Up until this point, nothing had been done like this in film and it was executed magnificently. Going into this movie in 2012 (having only seen Iron Man beforehand) I was skeptical and not interested. Then my brother took us to the theater to see it and it was one hell of a blast. I was blown away and wanted to watch all of the other Phase 1 movies and learn more about these other heroes. The casting and chemistry between them is on point, the villain is compelling and gets under your skin in the best way, and Robert Downey Jr.'s humor all around is unforgettable, and how can I not mention that glorifying theme song?? Not to mention Stan Lee's perfect cameo!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An Unstoppable Force of Awesomeness! All Hail The New King!,"I have got to tell anyone who will listen that this is one of THE best adventure movies I've ever seen. It's almost impossible to convey how pumped I am now that I've seen it. I purposefully avoid hyping myself for movies because when expectations are too high, nothing seems to be able to reach them. I usually avoid the hype train whenever possible. That said, I was jacked to see this movie and was fully aboard the hype train. It couldn't be helped. So, I was certainly open to intense disappointment had this movie not been good. I'm so happy to report just the opposite has happened.The only word I can think of to describe this movie is AWESOME. It's amazing work and everything I had hoped for and more. It's exceptional entertainment for the uninitiated but it has everything a fanboy could want to be sure. It has every little nuance of what a fanboy wants to see. One of the MANY things I loved was the tension and flat out conflict that arises between team members. It's not a two dimensional ""team wonderful that bands together to fight crime ho ho ho."" Most don't like each other at fist and there is so much texture to be played. That is great because so many of these characters are larger than life. They have egos and the big guns aren't used to working with other people or even playing by the rules. Stark, Thor and Banner all work ""the other side of the fence"" so to speak. Then there's the Widow, Hawkeye and Captain America who are used to following orders and playing within a command structure. They are all thrown together in a wonderful and, best of all, believable fashion. Again, more than I ever dreamed possible.The entire cast really delivered. You needed more than just action actors or stunt doubles to play all these parts. The pathos is there but so are the timing and true deep performances. Look, I was missing Ed Norton as much as anyone on that hype train I talked about but I'm so happy to say that Mark Ruffalo won me over. I hope he's locked up for the long haul because we don't need any more changes. Three was the lucky number for movie Banners. Every other actor in Avnegers that we've seen before is BETTER than their previous incarnation (EVERY single one) with the possible exception of RDJ as Stark. He's great but it's hard to top his take on the character from the original Iron Man in an ensemble movie. I also have to fully disclose that I'm insanely attracted to Scarlett Johansson. I thought her Widow character was amazing but I'm definitely judging that through rose colored glasses. The character arcs that run there course during this film will surprise a lot of general audiences expecting nothing more than a Transformers type popcorn scarfdown.I honestly don't want to give away ANY of the movie with this review because this is one film that needs every scene to be savored. Do yourself a favor and remain unspoiled. It's how I saw the movie (apart from what the trailers showed) and even though you're obviously reading this review, read no others with any kind of spoilers whatsoever. Experience the awesomeness for yourself. Avengers as a movie and as a team on screen is an unstoppable force. I'm just going to say, Hulk & Thor combination equals AWESOME and leave it at that. This movie defines MUST SEE.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Bad-ass descent-amazing superhero MCU action flick defenders of the earth my favorite,"Marvel's The Avengers (2012) is an awesome descent MCU superhero action flick that is spectacular and a real good one. The first time I watched it on my computer I loved it. I have seen this movie many times in the row I have this film on DVD and Blu-ray. The movie features an ensemble cast that includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston, Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders, Stellan Skarsgård, and Samuel L. Jackson. Joss Whedon did a fine job directing the film and I loved it is definitely in my top 10 favorite MCU superhero films. In the finale battle in New York the moment right there.. WILL NEVER... EVER.. BE AS COOL.. LIKE THIS WAS A COMIC MASTERPIECE.. I don't even read comics, but I did superheroes when I was younger.. I have a feeling justice league will never have this cohesion... this team work.. and will never be able to recreate this feeling.Robert Downey Jr. does a good job as a Iron Man he has a lot of good moments when he talks with Loki. In the third act he has to fight Thor that was cool then in the third act he had to do a lot of stuff, did the final stuff to safe the world. He is very much star of the film, that is why he number 1 star of the film he was payed a lot of more money then the other actors did ,but he deserved it he did a good job. Chris Evans as Captain America was spectacular I love his character I love how he defended and safe those people in the restaurant against Loki's army I thought that was descent. He does kick some ass when Thor hits him he uses his shield when SHIELD's ship was attacked he and Iron Man were trying to fix the ship I loved that.Mark Ruffalo was okay as The Hulk I thought he was better than Edward Norton's Hulk at least that is my opinion. Chris Hemsworth I liked him as Thor he was great. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow was fantastic what does she do? She deals with the Hulk and Hawkeye the evil Hawkeye which I think is great. Jeremy Renner I like him a as an actor he is cool, he is mostly the bad guy in the film till the third act. In the third act he did a lot of cool stuff, he is cool with arrows. Loki he did fine the actor did fine as the villain I like him and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury did fine.In the film, Nick Fury, director of the peacekeeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D., recruits Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, and Thor to form a team that must stop Thor's brother Loki from subjugating Earth.The pacing to me I thought it was little boring and it was too long but the third act was really was fast paced and the movie interested how 6 superheroes become a team who turn in to Avengers I think there was a lot of action scenes in the film that were really well done. I like special effect, I had a lot of fun scenes Hulk punching Thor or punching Loki when he said is emperor. That was fun, the film it self had a lot of action it self's.It was entertaining, the CGI was really good, Robert Downey Jr. had a lot funny moments and hilarious dialogues. I have more enjoyed Captain America because he cared more about people and of course Iron Man he saved the world from Loki's invaders. I thought it was an alright and I love it. It is definitely my favorite MARVEL superhero movie.Admittedly the first half or so isn't nearly as epic as the final 30 minutes. And the plot isn't that original. But I got what I paid for with this flick, Awesome action with Earth's Mightiest Heroes kicking alien ass.The Avengers in my honest opinion was better than Man of Steel because right next year DC superman movie come out that I have hated it and I wish I could have get the money back. I am going to try and sell the movie out.Marvel's The Avengers (classified under the name Marvel Avengers Assemble in the United Kingdom and Ireland), or simply The Avengers, is a 2012 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sixth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film was written and directed by Joss Whedon.I have reviewed 2 years the second movie twice and as a MARVEL fan I can say I have enjoyed this movie much more than Avengers: Age of Ultron. I am waiting now on Avengers: Infinity War and of course Spider-Man: Homecoming which is a spin off Captain America: Civil War like I said I have enjoy all three Captain America Films and I enjoy both Avenger films and I love Iron Man and Iron Man Three I am one of the fans that I liked that films. The rating I give is 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Avengers assembled flawlessly,"I'm sorry to say The Avengers isn't a good movie; it's a GREAT  MOVIE!!!! It's not only the best team superhero movie ever made, but it  may just be the best comic book adaption made period!  The Avengers is the culmination of what began in Iron Man; and  continued through The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain  America. It was only a few years ago that my son and I had just  finished watching Iron Man and as the credits were ending, Samuel L.  Jackson appeared on screen as Nick Fury and spoke to Tony Stark about  joining Avengers Initiativein that short scene, the framework for  potentially the greatest comic book movie of all-time had begun!   Director Joss Whedon, most known for the T.V. series Buffy The Vampire  Slayer, takes the foundation that was built in the prior films and  brings together the greatest team of superheroes in film history, The  Avengers: Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain  America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk/Bruce  Banner (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye  (Jeremy Renner) as ""assembled"" by Nick Fury. Whedon's scripts usually  include clever banter, gripping action sequences and an air of mystery  and The Avengers is no different. Whedon has an utter love for comic  books, and it is proudly put on display in The Avengers.  The cast does a great job of bringing these iconic characters to life,  beginning with Robert Downey Jr. Unlike Iron Man 2, in which Downey  seemed to skate through scene after scene, Downey plays Stark almost  effortlessly, delivering his lines with relative ease allowing his  charisma, charm and smugness to shine through; Robert Downey Jr. IS  Tony Stark! Chris Evans' solidifies himself in the role of Captain  America. He was very good in his solo film, but truly owns the role  standing alongside Iron Man and Thor. Chris Hemsworth's Asgardian god  Thor has some incredible battle scenes and indirectly provides one of  the film's most funny moments. After being seriously underutilized in  Iron Man 2, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow is provided a back-story,  which helps in developing the character and provides an opportunity to  prove she is much more than just a pretty face; she's as dangerous  psychologically as she is physically. I could envision myself enjoying  a beat-down at the hands (and feet) of Black Widow. The character I was  most concerned about being given little story and the least amount of  screen time was Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye; happily, he's not left by the  wayside and does a more than admirable job of developing the character.  Hawkeye stands alongside Robin Hood and Katniss Everdene (The Hunger  Games) as the best archers to grace the silver screen. I'd like to see  more of him in a film of his own. Mark Ruffalo, the most recent choice  to play Hulk, is far better suited to the role than Eric Bana (The  Hulk) and Ed Norton Jr (The Incredible Hulk). Ruffalo looks more the  part of the nerdy scientist Banner and plays the part without looking  angry in every scene. In The Avengers, the Hulk is at his most  impressive, both in his on-screen transformation and the violence he  displays when the opportunity calls for him to ""hulk out"". If any  character appeared to stand out a little bit more than the others, for  me it was the Hulk. Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury is finally more than  just the guy making surprise appearances. Fury is finally able to  stretch his legs some, and Jackson slides quite easily into the role.  Clark Gregg's Agent Caulson returns, and Cobie Smulders makes her  Marvel films debut as Agent Maria Hill, and she is a welcome addition.  The film's main villain is Thor's adopted-brother Loki, played by Tom  Hiddleston. You would think the part would be a difficult one to play  being opposite such powerful personalities and strong characters, but  Hiddleston does a fantastic job; the performance should not go  unnoticed, because it's one of the strong points of the film. Loki is  not a villain without purpose and Hiddleston comes across as a devious  mastermind without being cartoonish.  At a running-time of 2+ hours, The Avengers is well paced and time  flies by. The effects are top-notch, the acting is very good, and the  script drives the movie elevating its strengths. For viewers that may  not have seen any of the other films (and if so, why not!?!?), we're  provided just enough information to bring everyone up to speed without  feeling overdone. Whedon provides more than just a standard comic book  film, but a story with reason that's backed up with incredible action  and humor.   Although the film is filled with larger than life characters, none are  short changed; each character is given at least one great scene to work  with, and the opportunities don't go to waste. The film's finale  provides a deafening crescendo of action that is breathtaking. As usual  with Marvel films, be sure to stay around for the post credit sequence,  which provides a surprising reveal.  I went into The Avengers with unfairly high expectations, due to all of  those that were involved, as well as the films that came before it.  After viewing the initial trailers and not being blown away, I had set  myself up for disappointment. It was only a matter of minutes after the  film started that I was put at ease, and just minutes later when my  expectations were blown away. I never imagined that it was possible to  put onto the screen, what I was watching. I'm happy that Marvel had the  sense to keep these properties to themselves and to move forward with  these characters in the manner in which they did. Marvel Studios and  Disney are going to make a boatload of money off this film, and  deservedly so; because there's never been another movie made of its  caliber.

"The world loves it, though I still think the original ""Iron Man"",  ""Thor"" and ""Captain America"" were my favorites.","At this point, ""The Avengers"" has made around 100 trillion dollars (or so)--and so it's obvious that people love the film. My own daughter went to the premier in New York and then went to it on opening night in general release--and was mad I didn't take her with me tonight to see it! Obviously, she loved the film as well. As for me, I liked it but didn't quite share the overall exuberance for the film. Mind you, I liked it--but I think I preferred the earlier films before the Avengers team was formed. There was a certain charm that I didn't quite see recaptured in the film. Now the film is good--it's just that what I like in these other films I would have liked more of in ""The Avengers"". Specifically, the movie could have used a bit more humor and a bit more character development. When I read the IMDb trivia, it seems that originally the film had about 30 more minutes--all showing Steve Rogers (Captain America) trying to adjust to his new life. I would have LOVED seeing all this--and less of the HUGE battle at the end of the film. For me, it just felt numbing after a while and I would have liked more of the characters when they weren't fighting. Again, however, I DID like the film....but the earlier Marvel/Disney films I liked just a bit better. Just my two cents worth...",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Comic Book Triumph!,"I was lucky enough to be included in the group to see the advanced screening in Melbourne on the 15th of April, 2012. And, firstly, I need to say a big thank-you to Disney and Marvel Studios.Now, the film... how can I even begin to explain how I feel about this film? It is, as the title of this review says a 'comic book triumph'. I went into the film with very, very high expectations and I was not disappointed.Seeing Joss Whedon's direction and envisioning of the film come to life on the big screen is perfect. The script is amazingly detailed and laced with sharp wit a humor. The special effects are literally mind-blowing and the action scenes are both hard-hitting and beautifully choreographed.While all of these things (script, action, special effects and so on and so forth) are important... it's no good having them spot on if you don't have a cast that just isn't right. But fortunately, for fans and for the actors involved, Whedon's cast not only work brilliantly together but are perfectly comfortable wailing on each other and threatening each other all day and night.The actors' performances in ""Marvel's The Avengers"" are simply captivating and there are many instances where we get a glimpse further into their characters pasts and innermost feelings. Robert Downey Jr. will have you in stitches. Scarlett Johansson will have you staring in disbelief as she winds her way through sticky situations. And Tom Hiddleston will have you simply shaking in your seat with fear.All in all, Marvel's The Avengers is a visual delight and I cannot wait to see it again, and again, and again. Marvel fans will not be disappointed, and something tells me that most of you will agree with me wholeheartedly.The Avengers, assembled and awe-inspiring.

Nothing Short of Amazing,"I just saw the early screening for San Diego through the top 10 cities on facebook who got them. And suffice to say I am glad I was privileged enough to.First off, this hands down is the best Marvel movie ever. I don't say that lightly. And in terms of superhero movie with maybe the Nolan Batman series being tied with this, I thought Whedon did an amazing job to bring out all these characters in this one movie. I especially like what was done with Hawkeye and Black Widow just because those two didn't really have their individual movie with their back story.You can tell when a comic book fan writes and directs a comic movie because it clearly showed in all areas of production for this film. Going into the film I honestly thought that a lot of the cool mutant action scenes would be strictly Iron Man and Captain America. But Whedon does such a great job giving each mutant their 15 mins of fame and by the end of it you seriously feel like ""Wow this guy/chick is a badass"" for every mutant. I will admit i am not a Hulk fan. I like the inner story for it but was never a fan of the films, show or comic. But Hulk's role in the movie is so awesome I became a fan just from it.If any of you are Whedon fans then you guys/girls will love this movie. It has his M.O. written all over the humor and story presentation. And there were definitely parts in the movie where I thought ""Wow this seems like Firefly and Serenity"". And story aside, if you read, watched, or idolized Marvel superheros as a kid, the action alone will make you cheer just out of sheer nostalgia of imagining The Avengers or X-Men all together on the screen kicking ass.In summation, I don't need to say you NEED to watch this movie because I think anybody who is anybody already knows they want to see this. All this review has done was just reaffirm the hype behind this movie. I don't say this much but job well done Marvel and Disney for hiring a writer/director who has the audaciousness to keep it honest and true for those most dedicated comic fans who are the backbone of Marvel comics being a success. And in this day and age of superhero movies and movies in general that is very hard to do. Cheers Joss Whedon!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mostly entertaining popcorn-flick with amazing action; not much else,"'The Avengers', first of all, is a good movie. While sometimes overlong, it's entertaining, and the action scenes are amazing. However, it doesn't have enough depth to be another one of those ""classic superhero films"". The reputation instead should be ""enjoyable superhero flick"". First off, if an effort is made to assemble all of MARVEL's Avengers, that effort must be made with a little more success than this.'The Avengers' ends up feeling like more sequel than spin-off, instead of studying and developing each character. If we're supposed to care about all these superheroes...give them noticeable differences, more display of emotions, and a distinctive background. Just because they're superheroes who have some funny one-liners doesn't mean the viewers will automatically think they're the best people who ever lived. In other words, the characters have too little depth. Something that bugs me is that a few people have been saying this is better than Christopher Nolan's ""Batman"" trilogy, yet the latter is a perfect example of a series of films that have greatly influenced (and perhaps even transcended) the superhero genre.In 'The Dark Knight' there wasn't a single character who was ""just there for nothing"". Meanwhile, Loki is an uninteresting villain and doesn't hold a candle to Heath Ledger's disturbing, brilliant portrayal of The Joker (who, on the other hand, actually seems like a villain even when he's just not doing anything). How come 'The Avengers' all have to work to defeat Loki and his army, while Hulk can simply toss him around like a plastic spoon? That said, the long action sequence where the assembled Avengers all defeat Loki's army is quite outstanding, and many detractors of this film admit that this is also the best part.It contains amazing cinematography, like a minute-long shot that steadily observes each Avenger and sees how they're doing with the aliens. Of course, the rest of the action scenes are also top-notch, considering there's fighting for most of the movie. The sequence with Black Widow running away from The Hulk is especially memorable, and displays arguably the most likable Avenger here, along with Iron Man. The two that we care the most about.Overall, I'd say that 'The Avengers' could have been cut about 20-30 minutes short to flow more as a superhero film. I had hoped for more character development, since there were so many characters to pay attention to. I loved the action, and was pleased with the clever action scenes, especially the last 40 minutes and the parts with Black Widow. It's undeniably entertaining, and while it's not transcendent and genius, it's a great popcorn-flick. Would I see it again? Yes, but not my #1 priority.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
They balanced everything masterfully.  As Good As It Gets!!!,"If you're a fan of epic adventure movies, then this is your dream come true. This is the type of film you fantasized about growing up! It really is the ultimate superhero mash-up and it's done perfectly. The makers of this film certainly understand spectacle but they also get the intricacies and depth these type of characters can provide. That right there assures this instant classic will be thought of as the best as well as the biggest film of 2012. The depth of this movie really did surprise me. Even though the high quality of the actors involved and there previous work as these very same characters seemed to indicate otherwise, I was expecting a wild popcorn movie. I was wrong in thinking it was too much to convey in one film. I couldn't be more pleased because they balanced everything masterfully. Sure, there's the popcorn fun we were all expecting but there's also a definite soul to the film and a smart plot as well. It's truly a stupendous movie regardless of genre.Marvel did it, they pulled off the culmination of a master plan that's been taking shape for years. They deliver a movie the likes of which we've never seen before and as good of a film that's ever been made in its genre.There's a reason this grand of a movie has never been attempted before now. How do you fully flesh out, care about and establish this vast group and still deliver a fun, crisp and coherent story? It's extremely difficult to navigate that edge-of-your-seat excitement while at the same time caring about each one of the characters and their struggles. One of the most impressive aspects of The Avengers is that they managed to get each hero their time in the spotlight and their own character arc. Every single main lead steps up and is treated with remarkable intelligence and given room to shine.I loved that the stakes in this film are ridiculously high and the threat so impressive that there really is a need for these diverse characters to come together. That could have been a stumbling block in terms of story but it's treated just right. It's also a great idea that they chose to introduce all the characters to the audience as if you've never seen them before. Sure, the other films set up and give depth to each character but even if you missed their solo films, you'll still know and care about them in this movie.It's also wonderful that everything is as big as it should be. This truly is the comic book epic of our lifetime (the fanboy version of Gone With The Wind circa 1939 if you will) and it all shows up on screen. Everything looks GREAT and feels epic. The equipment (love that Helicarrier), the relationships, the stars, the characters themselves and the battles are all huge and as fully mesmerizing as they should be. There are scenes that are emotional and there are scenes that are going to make any audience member scream ""BADASS!"" and mean it.I'm serious when I say that the big, explosive moments are as grand as they should be but it's the smaller character moments in this film that really take it to another level. At this point, we've all seen how good some CG action can get but grounding it with a great story and with meaningful quieter moments is what makes a movie good. That's the ace up the Avengers sleeve. This is NOT some CGI video game movie. Cut out the action and I'd still want to see this movie. So, it's safe to say that they are replicating the comic book experience on the big screen. Years of depth coupled with spectacle and advanced fiction is a treat for non-comic book and comic book fans alike. That's is The Avengers greatest power... the ability to entertain all comers!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not 100% perfect but still an outstanding film in so many ways,"Superhero films are always fun to watch when they are done right, and while to some degree it is understandable why people wouldn't be totally enamoured with it(as seen in a lot of the negative comments, a lot of them being condescending though- enough with the ignorant conspiracy theories already!- and some not even worthy of being called reviews) Avengers Assemble for me was an example of a fun and intelligent superhero film that was done right. True, the story is formulaic but not to the extent that was too distracting. In fact my only two complaint was to do with one performances that didn't quite work personally. And that was Jeremy Renner who was rather on the dull side as Hawkeye, whose character development did seem a little rushed and underwritten, that Hawkeye has inner demons is made very clear but it could have come through more strongly. However the rest of the performances were great, a big shout out going to Tom Hiddleston who is serpentine personified as Loki, though Robert Downey Jnr's charismatic Iron Man, Samuel L. Jackson's no-nonsense Nick Fury, Mark Ruffalo's very confident Hulk(he doesn't make you miss Eric Bana or Ed Norton), Chris Hemsworth's dynamic and not wimpy Thor(if he was I put it down to his hidden demons character development) and Chris Evans' modest, heartfelt Captain America were equally great. Scarlett Johansson convinces mostly too, Black Widow's back story is intriguing and Johansson is wonderful when she acts fearless but when in her emotional, imploring moments her acting is rather forced and out of character for Black Widow. For a film with as many characters as seen here, Avengers Assemble still makes a vast majority of them very interesting(only Hawkeye really disappointed), in character and not one-sided and all of them have their turn to shine. It didn't feel to me like a film that tried to cram in too many heroes all at once for the sake of it. The film is very slickly made with astounding special effects and dazzlingly executed stunt-work. Alan Silvestri's score pulsates with power and the action sequences are exciting. The story may be formulaic and standard good-and-evil but is crisply paced and intelligently handled with just the right blend of humour, pathos and action with not one component over-shadowing the others. What was really enjoyable especially was the toe-to-toe with Thor and Iron Man and Hulk. What was really remarkable was the script, filled with thoughtful exposition and snappy banter that stayed true to The Avengers while also with Joss Whedon's own style that was apparent in a lot of his other work. Overall, Avengers Assemble may not be 100% perfect or among the best ever but it is still an outstanding film with a lot to love about it, and no this is not coming from a fake account or a plant, just someone who can be hard to please who genuinely enjoyed it. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I knew it couldn't live up to the rating,"I missed this movie when it came out at the cinema because, from what I could see from the trailers and elsewhere, it looked a bit 'silly' for want of a better word, kid's stuff perhaps. We've come to expect much more from comic book interpretations. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the Iron Man series, Spiderman and Batman reboots. Where I draw the line I think, is with characters such as Thor and Captain America and to a lesser extent the Hulk - characters who haven't dated too well at all and should have been left in their respective times. They just look so out of place sitting along side the more believable and 'cooler' looking characters like Iron man in present day settings. But anyhow, having seen the high ratings the movie was getting (including on here) I thought 'maybe it cant be so bad after all?' and gave it a look. Sadly my initial instinct was right - this film is well made, has great CGI and acting, but.. its entirely spoilt by the inclusion of silly outdated characters with dubious special powers and a guy who turns into a CGI cartoon green man/monster. I realise that it wouldn't be as much of an assemble without these characters and to substitute spiderman or other superheroes might well upset some purists, but might have made for a better film. Thor in particular is from a bygone era of comic books and should have been left there.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Great, GREAT FILM!!","Ever since the beginning of the film, I was so amazed and happy That I was at the premier of the movie. Very good acting from all the main characters and good acting from the rest. Great Directing and writing from Joss Whedon too. The cinematography was stunning throughout the whole film.This is a fun action packed film for the whole family to enjoy just like the rest of the Marvel movies but better. The special effects by far are the best for any Marvel movie. The Hulk Looks so much more real. By the way The Hulk made the movie even better. Also, DO NOT SEE THE AVENGERS IN 3D!

A Stunning Visual Effects-Driven Spectacle,"'Avengers Assemble' ('The Avengers') is a truly enjoyable superhero film that lives up to its hype and creates a story that allows for four of the greatest superheroes to connect in this mega-blockbuster extravaganza. Joss Whedon has created one of the most action-packed Marvel films to have graced the screen, full of humour, thrills and a great cast of characters, all of which impel this visual effects-driven spectacle. Whilst I had the great opportunity to watch this epic in the cinema in 3D, the film is equally as stunning on an average television set, with the final battle between the Avengers and Loki's army being one of the most spectacular scenes in a superhero movie. An impressive and remarkable fantastical superhero flick from Whedon.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
GREAT SUPERHERO MOVIE,"The Avengers follows Nick Fury and the spy agency S. H. I. E. L. D. recruiting Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Bruce Banner, Thor, Natasha Romanoff and Clint Barton to form a team capable of stopping Thor's brother Loki from subjugating Earth. The movie has a very good balance of heroism and humour, great characters' development, an interesting villain, great action-packed sequences and a big use of the CGI.

A Fan Service,"The Avengers movie must be a dream come true to everyone. Seeing these superheroes uniting together to save the world in the big screen. While the heroes' stand alone films doesn't have that enough action, this movie executes more of their super abilities. It's really fun and exciting. A lot of people will cheer to their favorite superheroes. This is what all fans and moviegoers want in Avengers. More fighting, more explosions, more smashing, and more fun. In the end, you will crave for more because of its awesomeness. The Avengers is simply marvelous.Our modern blockbusters are just full of explosions that makes no sense, bland characters, and too long runtime. The runtime here is long but it's necessary. The storytelling is quite simple as it gets. We already knew who these characters are. The best part is when they develop their relationship to each other. This happened mostly in the second act. These scenes are funny and entertaining. It's more entertaining when there's Robert Downey Jr. stealing the show. Of course, he will always be like this. His chemistry with Bruce Banner is wonderful. Two geniuses working together. Other than that, the rest of the performances were also good. Chris Hemsworth is just mighty enough as Thor and Chris Evans is cool enough as Captain America. Scarlett Johansson is probably the weak link here. She's still sexy though.Maybe the only problem here is the secondary villains. They are not as dangerous or as threatening as they suppose to be which makes it too easy for Hulk to smash them. But it doesn't matter because there's Loki stealing all of his scenes once again. Tom Hiddleston is simply fantastic as Loki. The action is pretty awesome. It's suppose to be awesome! The Hulk nails it in these scenes. It's exciting to see him smash stuff with glory. While there's Iron Man flying, Thor wielding his hammer, Captain America throwing his shield, and Hawkeye shooting with his archer. More explosions, just what everyone wants. It's fantastically cool and fun.There are still compelling moments and drama here but the main attraction of this film is the action and explosions. The film also cares about the characters which makes it reasonable for us to care about them and cheer to them. It's a rare kind of blockbuster these days. It has clever humor, awesome action, and really fun characters. It makes the Fans and Moviegoers happy and amazed. This is the kind of blockbuster that people should watch. This film is just cool and highly recommended to see this summer. Though, I still think the first Iron Man movie is the best of this set, but still, this is a big, fun experience you will have in the big screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Marvel's Avengers: Joss Whedon I'm officially your number 1 Fanboy and a believer,"Although Marvel Pictures have always made curious appointments in regards to their feature film directors the results have been mostly solid, if not spectacular thus far. I certainly didn't expect Jon Faverau to deliver one of the best comic-book movies ever – Iron Man. If it wasn't for DC's own Billionaire playboy superhero would've champion Iron Man as the best flick in the genre. Yes I do rate Iron Man that highly. Spider-Man 1 & 2 were good but didn't exactly capture the essence of Peter Parker while Spider-Man 3 was a huge mess, not Mark Steven Johnson mess, but a mess nonetheless. Last year's motion picture debuts of Marvel staples Thor and Captain America were also very good, very faithful to their respective source material. Joe Johnston redeemed himself after a misguided attempt at bringing the Wolfman back to the silver screen, whereas Kenneth Branaghs Shakespeare sensitive's proved a stroke of genius in fitting Thor into Marvel's motion picture universe. To be honest I even enjoyed 2008's The Incredible Hulk after Ang Lee damn near killed the franchise.Even though Marvel Pictures has proved time and again to make the right decisions when producing a movie on its own, the hiring of Joss Whedon seemed like an odd choice. Of course Joss Whedon is the genius behind TV-cult hits like Buffy, Angel and Firefly but his only foray into directing was 2005's Serenity. Managing all those superstar egos, handling multiple character arcs, dealing with several multimillion dollar franchises and making everyone happy from top brass executive down to the hardcore fanboys – to be honest, I wouldn't have entrusted him with a fraction of the $200-million-plus budget for The Avengers. Thus far only two directors have managed to pull off the impossible and accomodated several superheroes in a single movie – Bryan Singer (X-Men & X2) and Matthew Vaughn (X-Men First Class) while Brett Ratner ruined X-Men 3 with his unfocused direction. At first I thought Joss Whedon would do an even more terrible job than the latter, considering that Ratner had more filmmaking experience than Whedon at the time of filming X3. But nothing could be further from the truth. Joss Whedon is the MASTER, with a captial M.Let me say it out loud:JOSS WHEDON IS A COMIC BOOK MOVIE GOD.Unlike Ratner he actually cares about the characters and their development throughout the movie. You think Tony Stark would just waltz through the movie and roll over every other character? You are wrong. Though Robert Downey Jr. is in top form as he always is when he dons the Iron Man suit, the other characters are far from underdeveloped and don't crumble under the pressure of his larger-than-life persona. If anything it's the Hulk that absolutely steals the show. That said, I think we have found the definitive Bruce Banner, Mark Ruffalo, he absolutely owns the role. He is the Hulk and we finally got the Hulk we deserved. Everybody brings their A-game and every character gets a fair amount of screen time. I can't find any flaw in this movie. Of course the special effects are spectacular but it's the dialogue that won me over. Really. Each character in this movie has at least one or two memorable lines – not just Tony Stark. When you watch the Avengers make sure you listen to the dialogue carefully – I've never heard dialogue this witty in any comic movie, and I've watched my fair share. Joss Whedon you are the freaking man. They said it was impossible to accommodate this many characters in a single movie – they were wrong. From now on everyone will reference this movie whenever multiple larger-than-life figures are thrown into one supersized extravaganza – Yeah I'm slamming the last two Transformers flicks. I guarantee Joss Whedon would've done justice to the franchise. After watching the Avengers everything that bears the name of Joss Whedon is a must-see for me now.Final verdict: 10 out of 10. This movie is Iron Man on steroids. Go watch that movie!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Avengers - one of the best superhero film so far!,"Believe me when I say that 'The Avengers' was my most anticipated movie ever. I mean, come on, a bunch of superheroes gathering and fighting evil, that is just priceless. And not any superheroes but the most well-known and well-loved. The movie has some of the best actors in Hollywood portraying some of the best superheroes to have ever been created. This movie has loads of Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hawkeye, and, needless to say, Hulk Smash! They were all portrayed on screen brilliantly and I give thanks to the actor for making them feel awesome, cool, and really, really fun. I live in Australia and we get an earlier viewing of the film but for you Americans, this wait is is worth it. When the movie was over, most of the cinema clapped - this was the first time I had ever seen this ever at the movies. Even though it was 12 in the morning, the whole cinema was packed and all of them came out of the cinema satisfied and were glad they paid the $13 to watch it.The plot of the movie is straightforward but done magnificently. Loki, previously seen in Thor, wants to wreak havoc on Earth by letting a group of aliens enter Earth through a portal. It's up to the Avengers to stop him but first they have to solve the rivalries and bitterness between them. The fight scenes between the superheroes are just f*cking AWESOME! I was so excited to see Thor and Iron Man battle it out - that scene was just plain epic.The music and soundtrack in the movie was good and it did a nice job of alleviating the action, and trust me there is a LOT of action. The visual effects are also fantastic, one of the best I have ever seen in a film, and they will leave you in awe. Hulk, along with Iron Man, do a good job of adding humour into the film and ALL of the scenes with the Hulk left everyone at the cinemas laughing. It is pretty obvious that his squad mates think highly of him as seen in the scene where Stark and Loki have a confrontation ('We have an Army' , 'We have a Hulk'). That scene was what did it for me.If you guys are in doubt as to see this then let me assure you that you are gonna get the bang for your buck that you deserve. So far, it is one of the best superhero film made but of all time? Not really sure, guess we have to wait for TDKR to come out. 10/10 - Perfect!'Over and Out.' 25 April 2012",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"If you're already a fan you'll love it, if not it's yet another well crafted superhero CGI flick","The Avengers (2012)First: this is high energy stuff with lots of superhero fighting. Lots. Beyond that I had to pick and choose what I liked and what seemed to be dragged out a bit. It was never slow, but it was often a bit uninteresting.the real downside to the movie was, well, the plot, which had yet another super huge super awful enemy that required our local team to go out and find a way to conquer. It never really mattered why these bad people were coming (though they do explain why, with a spacey glowing cube and Thor's half-brother having some childhood issues unresolved). The set design, however, was really ambitious, not only with the huge scenes and big CGI effects, but the range and diversity of interiors with a deliberate variety of styles that related to the different characters. And some of the actors and actresses were terrific to watch, even if they didn't really have much to say or do that mattered (besides save the world, of course).If this sounds like I'm not cut out of this type of movie you are mostly wrong. I have loved, for example, the three Nolan ""Batman"" movies, a couple of the ""Spiderman"" ones, and a few oddballs here and there, all of which work on some of the same principles of super villain and a modified New York (Gotham, etc.) as a city of resilient victims to save.Small (relevant) confession: I loved the Iron Man movies and never saw any of the other Marvel character movies like the Hulk. In this all-star get together of a half dozen famous super-heroes I naturally loved the Iron Man parts and was neutral on the rest. Mostly because Robert Downey Jr. is a huge cut above the others of the cast in presence, in humor, in making the whole enterprise a comic book come to life, not a serious save-the-world epic. By contrast, the leader of the bad guys is a wan, half-hearted baddie who didn't create the chills or fear the movie badly needed.As a movie of characters taken from various Marvel comic book (and movie) series, it was how fully the characters were realized that made the difference. Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk was pretty great, though restrained a bit. The Black Widow in the hands of Scarlett Johansson was stunning to look at but also weirdly restrained (except the fighting of course). Thor was a bore, taking his old school power thing too too seriously. And Captain America, though a likable, cute guy, was also a bad casting job--he had to do more than look good (unlike, say, Gwyneth Paltrow, who simply had to look good since she unfortunately had nothing much to say or do).You'll know if this movie is your thing before you read this or see a trailer. It's a boiler plate super hero action movie with lots of computer effects and a standard villain from the universe menace. (The computer effects, like these skeletal ocean monsters swimming through Manhattan wrecking lots of buildings, are actually, surprisingly, a bit clunky once you start watching the details.)Overall, director and writer Joss Whedon seems a bit overwhelmed here, and has co-written a predictable bit of very expensive contemporary Hollywood stuff and then directed it without quite making it special. Or surprising. I mean, even Samuel L. Jackson is stiff and preachy. The movie has its moments for sure, but that's not enough. Disappointing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Childhood avenged,"I'm not going to spoil anything or get very technical here. I don't usually write reviews. I did so because this movie took me back to my childhood like no other movie did.Sure, it's not intellectually pretentious or groundbreaking from a cinematic or storytelling point of view, but it delivers perfectly.The wit, conflict, adventure, heart and sense of wonder that I once found in my crazy uncle's attic, slumbering inside those weird looking and dusty Marvel Magazines - populated with super-soldiers, handsome flying scientists, Norse gods, green monsters and incredibly hot chicks in black leather - are here.As I grew up, I somehow repressed the idea that there was no such thing as fictional happiness. These characters will never exist, and it sure takes suspension of disbelief to watch them run about. But this movie reminded me of what they made me feel before girls, party nights, college,taxes and other complicated, serious things came along. As the movie ended, I felt overwhelmed by the readjustment to reality as I knew it in my young adult life.I watched this with my 10 year old nephew. I don't know if that makes me the crazy uncle, but it sure was great to be back in that attic, even for a while. I always knew Hulk smashed.

Nowhere near what it's cracked up to be,"This movie is the definition of being over-hyped: Hardly any aspect of it has escaped being hailed as among the best of recent years, be it acting, special effects, fighting scenes or plot. In my opinion, it falls far, far short of that benchmark. The visual effects are very good, sure, but then so are the effects in Battleship.The acting isn't bad, but it's hardly impressive either. The few impressive performances are completely overshadowed by the very average writing. Platitudes, one-liners, soundbites and trailer lines are constant. Much of it makes no sense at all: Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is cautious about ""the other one"" and seems to dislike people knowing about it, yet he constantly references this. It's as if the writers thought ""We haven't shown Banner as the Hulk yet; better make him allude to that in his every line so people don't forget.""The largest problem with the movie, without a doubt, is the plot. The bad guy never feels threatening, his plan is extremely inefficient and frankly stupid in many ways, and the plot holes are too many to count. For instance, in one scene we see the Hulk being a mindless beast, destroying everything in his path, but later we see him taking orders. Add to that that the superhero who apparently has the power of super-aim misses whenever the script calls for it making his on-screen superpower ""is really good with a bow and arrow"". In one scene he misses half a dozen shots from a distance of 12 feet.On a related note, what is Captain Americas superpower compared to the others? Patriotism? Other Avengers are superiour in every single way. Ranged combat, close combat, mobility, intelligence, strength... Even his weapon is a worse version of Thors hammer. Not that Black Widow is any better, but at least she has some use in the plot.This movie is like The Expendables, only it takes itself seriously and has better acting. It is thoroughly unimpressive and how it currently has a rank of #57 of all time movies is truly baffling.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"I loved this movie's depth, heart, humor, gravitas, action, performances, emotion and payoff.","This remarkable movie easily fulfilled and then exceeded all expectations. I've been waiting for this movie since Sam Jackson's character uttered those famous words after the first Iron Man film... Stark now knows he's not the only superhero in his world and it's as big a treat for our real world as it gets. Seeing the ""Avenger Initiative"" in action is as great as I would ever have hoped! Hell, who am I kidding, I've been waiting to see this movie all my life. Who would've thought years ago that ALL these characters could fit in to a film and all of them be done justice? It delivers greatness from scene one and has to be considered the best this genre has EVER produced. Truthfully, as good as some of the previous work has been from every studio, nothing else has come close. That's not hyperbole; I really think most will agree if they see it with an open mind.

A Marvel-ous experience,"The wait for this movie has been excruciatingly long, ever since we saw the preview that was attached to Captain America. Here's what I thought of the movie when I caught the premiere.You get the best of Joss Whedon and that is quite a lot:1. Black Widow is no longer just a piece of eye-candy. Did you seriously expect the creator of Buffy to just let his female characters stand around looking pretty? She kicks ass and how! (Yes, and it's about time!)2. For all the newbies out there that haven't watched some or all of the previous movies, the rest of the characters are thoroughly fleshed out. You get a long explanation about what they have been up to since their story last ended. So, it's possible that the first half may be a tad slow for the die-hard fans, but the second half more than makes up for it. Also, for what it's worth, isn't it better to know what the characters have been doing all this while, before they get down to some serious action?3. The post-credits scene. Oh My God! There is no point, whatsoever, in going to watch the movie if you don't wait for it. You simply HAVE to see it.4. On a side-note, if you're relatively new to the Marvel universe, you must see The Superhero Squad Show (Yes, it's a cartoon, and no, it's not a very serious one either. But looking past all that, it's a serious refresher course in everything Marvel) before the next movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe releases, as it really helps you understand the characters. I wouldn't have understood the importance of the post- credits scene without it.5. The fight sequences (the gist of which we all saw over and over again at Comic-Con!) finally makes it look like we are watching a superhero movie. It's not one until some old-fashioned ka-pow!6. And yes, there are many scenes which are a fanboy's (or girl's) most awesome-est dream come alive!You also, however, get the worst of Whedon, which I admit, I pretty much dreaded. I won't say what it is, as it will spoil it for you, but it's really very obvious if you've seen anything of Buffy, Angel, Firefly, Serenity and Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog (my opinion may not, however, be accurate, as some might argue that what we've seen is actually, his best) Whatever the general consensus, there is no doubt that Whedon gives his best shot at leaving his mark in the Marvel 'verse (!) and his best is pretty darn good!If I simply HAVE to find flaws in the movie, the only one I can think of right now is that some important Avengers - Ant-Man, Wasp, Black Panther and Vision - are nowhere to be seen. Black Widow was the only token female in this all-testosterone group, so Wasp would have been a welcome addition, as the scales would not be so unbalanced.The Avengers works because underneath all the larger-than-life heroes with their huge egos, their actions and emotions are just human enough to be believable. Things do not just fall in place - everybody does not magically get along with each other and fight away to glory - they had to work hard to make it happen. And that, is this movie's biggest USP.All-in-all, go watch the movie, if not on the first day, then at least some other time for as long as it's on in the theaters. Your first glimpse of this movie just HAS to be on the big screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Beyond Excellent. Avengers Hits At The Highest Level!,"Yep, Marvel has done it again but this time to the max! You can rest assured that Avengers is an absolutely amazing movie. I'm so glad Marvel got in to the solo movie making business. Instead of leasing out their characters to other studios, they're making movies themselves and have not missed yet. (Sony pooping on Ghost Rider again this very year is a great reminder of that) Avengers is, without a doubt, their best effort yet! Personally, I think they set the bar leading up to this movie and they just clean blew the bar in to orbit with this movie.Avengers really takes the comic book genre to the highest level. They along with a select few others reinvented epic adventure as this century began by ""Marvelizing"" characters by making them more believable and more relatable. Spider-Man and the X-Men did this to a degree but only as far as their respective studios wished to stay true to the source material. Anything added or amended was for the benefit of the live action adaptation. Nolan did this for Batman and Raimi for Spider-Man. They pulled it off by talking to the summer crowd, not down to them. Favreau, Branagh and Johnston did similar good work for Marvel leading up to this gem. Now, Joss Whedon not only continues that tone but adds to the work that's come before. It's like the ultimate team work and Whedon brings it all home and all together perfectly. Like the great films of the past, he grounds the action and the superhero concept in firm reality. The humor and acknowledging the absurd nature of everything we see adds the perfect flavor. Yet, all the character depth and relationship nuances are fleshed out well as with any other good film.I've said it before but it's brave to reach for the highest common denominator with a big budget film and Avengers delivers a movie with as much feeling as it has action and intensity. It's a movie that has a wonderful balance that delivers intelligence with its fun. This is, without a doubt one of my top 10 movies of 2012, quite possibly THE best regardless of genre. I don't see anything changing that for the rest of the year. This movie is just that good",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"""The Avengers"" (2012)","As you well know by now, ""The Avengers"" is a large-scale superhero film that was four years in the making, with no less than four individual - yet inter-connected superhero films - feeding into this film's overall story. Joss ""Firefly"" Whedon was the director and co-writer on this highly ambitious project that is an adaptation of the Marvel Comics superhero team co-created by Stan Lee (who also appears in a very small cameo, like almost every other movie adaptation of a superhero he had a hand in creating) and the late Jack Kirby. Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Natasha Romanoff/The Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), and Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) are the six misfits chosen by Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Samuel L. Jackson) to defeat the traitorous Asgardian misfit Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and his alien army from laying waste to New York City. And of course, six characters usually accustomed to working alone have to work out their differences and come together as a team to save the world. What gets ""The Avengers"" many points is that beside its big action sequences, fights and special effects, we never really lose sight of the characters (who are usually relegated to the background in a movie like this) and who they are. I liked that the movie actually spent time developing the individual characters so that we get to know them all over again - even though they've all already appeared in previous superhero films. It's all big superhero fun, with a knowing wink and an outstanding sense of humor that manages to elicit some strong laughs from anyone viewing this thing with an open mind. Sit back and enjoy!10/10P.S.: What happened to Dr. Henry ""Hank"" Pym/Giant-Man and Janet van Dyne/The Wasp? Weren't they part of the original Avengers team line-up (before ""The Avengers #4"" when Captain America became team leader, marking the character's Silver Age debut)? This was my only real complaint about ""The Avengers.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Heroic Team-Up,"Hello everyone, I'm Mr. C Reviewer, tonight we are discussing the Movie, The Avengers. I watched it on Disney plus. The Movie first aired April 11, 2012. It has a runtime of 2 hours and 23 minutes. The avengers was rated PG-13. The Movie was directed and created by Joss Whedon and was also created by Zak Penn.Summary: When Earth faces an unprecedented threats, Nick Fury, the director of S. H. I. E. L. D., realizes that only a team of extraordinary individuals can save humanity.Review: -I found the voice-over at the beginning of the movie to be captivating; it sparked my interest and motivated me to continue watching. I was pleased that it took only about five minutes for the action to commence. Before watching this movie, I had just finished reviewing the previous instalment, so I skipped the trailer. I was pleasantly surprised to see one of the characters return, as I hadn't anticipated it. I'm glad I avoided the trailer since it revealed that character to being in this one. I appreciated the casting choices, even though Hulk was recast for this film. Each actor seemed well-suited to their roles, contributing to a strong performance overall. I found the gore in the movie to be visually impressive; some scenes appeared quite realistic, while others were less convincing. As an autistic individual, I was especially grateful for the inclusion of subtitles, which made it easier to follow the dialogue. However, I felt a bit disappointed that translations were not provided for dialogue spoken in other languages.I appreciated the film's cinematography, particularly its frequent use of close-ups to capture characters' emotions during intense moments. Medium shots framed characters from the waist up, facilitating interaction while providing context. Long shots established settings and showcased characters within their environments, especially effective in action sequences highlighting the scale of battles. High angle shots conveyed vulnerability among characters, while low angle shots used emphasized strength and dominance. Tracking Shots followed characters through space, enhancing viewer immersion. Over-the-Shoulder Shots captured dialogue exchanges, offering one character's perspective while highlighting the other's reactions. Establishing Shots introduced locations before action unfolded, with wide-angle views orienting viewers within various New York City settings. Montage Sequences combined rapid shot types to convey information quickly and depict the passage of time effectively. Dim lighting was used strategically to emphasize key elements within the frame. I found the film's soundtrack and sound effects to be particularly effective, as they complemented the scenes.I appreciated the CGI in the movie for its ability to create visually stunning sequences that enhanced the film's spectacle. The climactic battle scenes, especially those featuring large-scale destruction and alien invasions, showcased impressive visual effects that added realism to the superhero genre. The scale and detail of the CGI effectively immersed viewers in the action, complementing rather than overshadowing the narrative.I appreciated the film's focus on teamwork and unity. The story centres around a group of diverse individuals who come together to form a cohesive team, despite their differences. The superheroes must overcome their egos and learn to accept each other's assistance. Their distinct personalities make collaboration challenging, especially since they are accustomed to being the sole stars of their own narratives, which complicates their ability to unite. One of my favourite aspects was the humour woven throughout the movie. The clever exchanges between characters not only provide comic relief but also deepen their personalities, making them more relatable to the audience. This allows viewers to emotionally connect with each character, fostering a sense of investment in their individual journeys. Watching how each character interacts and reacts to one another was truly my favourite part of the film.-I appreciated the pacing at which we were introduced to the characters. My favourite character in this movie was Hulk; I found his personality both engaging and humorous. I also value Black Widow for her complexity and exceptional combat abilities, which enable her to stand shoulder to shoulder with her male counterparts. I admire that she was not merely a sidekick but an essential member of the team. However, I do feel that her character didn't received the same level of depth in development as her male peers.-I felt that the movie was a bit longer than necessary, and at times it seemed to drag. I enjoyed the ending and am eagerly anticipating the next instalment when all the characters reunite. I also appreciated the additional scenes after the credits; there were two, cleverly spaced between more credits with this one.I rate each Movie I watch out of 10 and for this one, I give it an 7.1 Remember this was what I thought about the film personally and I suggest that you give it a go for yourself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Flat out Exceptional Movie Event. (Best Villain in Years!),"I'm happy to report that everything established in previous movies pays dividends in a big way. It's not that anyone needs to see those other Avenger solo films before seeing this gem but it certainly adds depth and texture to this amazing product. Not having to intro big main characters deeply allows the action to flow but also allows for better development. This also allows them to probe deeper into the character's personalities. This heightens the tension, so often missing from comic-book movies, and adds real weight to the story as well as the action sequences which are thrilling and often mesmerizing. The result is a film that's just flat out exceptional.Of course all the phenomenal heroes got to shine and the story accommodated them all perfectly. What I loved is that Marvel did it again with their main villain. Loki was just so wonderful and complex in this amazing movie. Spurned Loki masterfully dances on the fault lines of villainy and redemption. He always keep people guessing and. Again, that's just shear perfection coming from the god of mischief. He has such a mixture of emotional psychological complexity. You have somebody who's capable of thinking and strategizing at the speed of light, but underneath that is a deep well of pain that at any moment threatens to boil over and Tom Hiddleston plays it like the master he has become. This is Oscar worthy villain performance good.The performances in this movie are as good as any I've ever seen in an adventure film. The great actors say that acting akin to playing tennis. The rally that they play with a new partner is completely different from one to the other. Each of these GREAT actors have such specific talents that it's fun to see them play off each other at different times in this movie. I think Whedon realized this as both director and writer and shuffled things around on purpose to play to strengths. It's just another wonderful aspect of this spectacular movie event.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best. Comic Book Movie. EVER.,"This, friends, is the comic book movie that all other comic book movies wish they could be. It's the pinnacle, the ultimate, the surely unsurpassable achievement in its particular oeuvre, a grand adventure full of humor, action, tension, fan service and an undeniable pathos. For anyone fearing that all the hype – years and years worth of hype – might cheapen or otherwise overshadow the final outcome, you may at last be at ease. Because the JOSS WHEDON! AVENGERS MOVIE! is exactly as good as we all hoped it could be.Maybe even better.The Avengers, of course, are a superhero team made up of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). Other heroes have come and gone amongst this happy few, in comic form, but here all you need to know is that this film serves as kind of a sequel to previous Marvel movies IRON MAN(both 1 and 2), THE INCREDIBLE HULK, THOR and CAPTAIN America, bringing the billionaire Tony Stark, the scientist Bruce Banner, the demigod Thor and the recently defrosted World War II veteran Steve Rogers together to fight against an invading alien threat, alongside spies Clint Barton (Jeremy Denner) and Natasha Romanov (Scarlett Johansson) and under the auspices of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.Man, it's awesome. AWE. SOME.Oh, it's by no means a perfect film. Whedon is perhaps just a shade too in love with S.H.I.E.L.D technology, and the weight of portent which is given to some truly innocuous lines – especially the final line – feels a little off-kilter. Flashing up a computer image of Natalie Portman's Jane (Thor's love interest from his movie) felt a little like an apology, and the shadowy government hacks who attempt to control Nick Fury are by-the-numbers backroom power players of the Cigarette Smoking Man-school, ruthless and annoyingly cliché.Everything else, though? Simply, outstandingly, without a shadow of a doubt incredible.Just for fun, let's talk acting. All our returning superheroes reprise their roles with ease, Downey Jr. once again a delight as the arrogant billionaire Stark and Evans stoic and earnest as the displaced Cap. The award for Most Improved has to go to Chris Hemsworth, whose Thor is given a chance to rock some deadpan wit here, and rock it he surprisingly does. Johansson, of course, is gorgeous and ass-kicking as ever in her Black Widow leather, but is happily also given new levels of intriguing backstory at which to hint and play out, and her friend Hawkeye is given somewhat more to do here than he was allowed in Thor, Jeremy Renner's relaxed performance once again worthy of my beloved marksman's bow and arrow. Clark Gregg's mild-mannered Agent Coulson is adorable in his hero worship; meanwhile our main antagonist in this film is Loki, Thor's resentful trickster brother once again played with consummate creepy cool by Tom Hiddleston.Oh, and hello again Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts! Aren't you funny and great?Of the newcomers, I will admit to having had some reservations about Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner, as I had been a true devotee of Edward Norton's turn in the role, but I am big enough to admit when I am wrong: he was terrific here as the mousey, mild-mannered science guy with a chip on his shoulder, and the uses to which his Hulk was put throughout the course of this movie have almost entirely changed my mind about his place in the Marvel Universe. It was that good. Elsewhere, How I Met Your Mother's Cobie Smulders, as an agent of S. H. I. E. L. D., did a lot with a little – enough to hope we see more of her lithe and loyal lieutenant character in AVENGERS 2.Indeed, after a rollicking, outrageous, hilarious outing like this one, who wouldn't already be eagerly awaiting a sequel? It is, unequivocally, the best comic book movie I have ever seen (and I've seen, well, all of them). More than that, it is my favorite movie so far this year – whew! I was so hoping BATTLESHIP wouldn't continue to hold that title for too much longer – and one I cannot wait to see again.Avengers assemble, they say? Audience assemble, I say! And assemble, and assemble, and assemble again(And make sure you stay through the credits for the now-expected next-movie teaser Buffy and Angel fans will be particularly happy, even if they don't quite get the somewhat obscure comic-y reference)-- This review first appeared in Geek Speak Magazine - www.geekspeakmagazine.com",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
AS expected,"The movie is certainly marvel's best till now and has great effects. Though little childish at times it is very good. As I expected it was one of the best films with descent, comedy parts. The acting was above average and the dialogues were really mind-boggling. It was a bit lengthy but was touching every single minute. The story was very good and the superhero's were described nicely. Bruce Banner very polite when he was not Hulk, Captain America very serious and all that. It was defiantly worth watching and is one of the best superhero films. I am looking ford for the Avengers 2 and I am searching the whole internet for a little glimpse of it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Solid fun movie,"THE GOOD- I was truly impressed with how well they pulled this movie off. The visual effects were all very clean. The characters were portrayed by the actors very well. This movie was loaded with action keeping everyone's attention glued to it. I was so impressed, I went to the theater to see it more than once and recommended it to everyone. I was very happy to see most of the actors return to portray their characters in this. THE BAD- Most characters.... The hulk was my big issue here. Mark Rufflo was good with the Bruce Banner character but the graphics for the hulk just did not meet the level of the movie starring Edward Norton. But it was not so bad that I could not look past it and really find enjoyment. I will most definitely go see another installment of Avengers.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Subpar Superhero Flick.,"This is an OK superhero flick featuring the Marvel Comics heroes Thor, Ironman, The Hulk, Captain America, Hawkeye and Black Widow. They are assigned to protect the entire globe from Loki, the stepbrother of Thor, and an alien invasion.There are plenty of enjoyable action is this movie, helped with some slapstick humor. The action sequences, especially during the climax, were breathtaking and exciting, leaving the audience thoroughly entertained. However, the movie's main plot and story aren't very captivating or compelling, coupled with lack of chemistry and substance between the cast of characters.I would like to have seen every superhero in this movie given a more elaborative purpose and equal screen time; it appeared that Ironman was the main focus of the movie and took away most of the glory - too much emphasis was placed on the character. Robert Downey Jr. was too cocky and tried too hard to be funny in the Ironman role.Overall, this movie is just one battle scene after the other. Not much of a story here, but it's something the kids would love to watch.Grade C",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

There were plenty of Hollywood retard thinking (which I wont mention so not to ruin the people that are not bother by it). Many funny moments and again lots of action. I would of also like if there had been full movies or some more back story on some of the characters but overall the movie was fun to watch. Great use of computer graphics and great sound track. In addition, the plot was not rich (which I think is acceptable in action movies).Definitely a great movie for anyone that like action flicks.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A consummate failure - here's why,"Here's why ""The Avengers"" fails so badly.1. Wrong, wrong director - Joss Whedon is a TV Director. ""Serenity"" worked because it was essentially a TV movie. And he has here made ""The Avengers"" a TV movie. Bad move, this should have gone to J.J. Abrams, Bryan Singer or Brad Bird.2. Dreadful miscasting - only Robert Downey Junior can hold his head high. Chris Evans is as wooden in this as the flat ""Captain America"" film. Those playing Thor, Hulk, Black Widow either phone in performances or look embarrassed.3. Weak, weak villain - Tom Hiddleston plays a slight, camp character who offers little panache or interest and more closely resembles a spoiled teenager than anything else. This film needed a ""General Zod"".4. Too much obvious CGI - come on, it's 2012, there's no excuse for the George Lucas-y effects like the flying Shield craft graphics.5. No drama, tension and a script so obviously flat that Whedon inserts misplaced self conscious quips to lighten the tone.For anyone growing up with Marvel comics in the 70's (chime with me on this), we deserved SO much more. For younger audiences, it will pass I'm sure.Really can't understand though the positive reviews. Am I alone in this ?",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Exceptional!  Oh my God. Oh. My. God. My mind is blown.,"I just loved Marvel's Avengers. I thought it was smart and the impressive cast really delivered! This movie works on so many levels and makes you draw on just about all of your emotions. I don't remember when I enjoyed a movie this much! Such cool fantasy but what makes it extra special is following this film after all the other solo efforts from each character. I enjoyed the others films quite a bit but they all delivered something different. Seeing them blend together in Avengers and the sparks that resulted was the extra special treat. Example: They blended the grounded futurist (Tony Stark) with the Norse thunder god and his angry brother in a perfect way. Same could be said for every other character. It all works. In fact, it doesn't just fit, it's a symphony and that dyconomy and difference in characters are what makes it truly great. It's why this movie stands so tall above any other franchise at the moment. Things like Transformers, GI Joe and even Star Trek all operate with monotone restrictions. Avengers covers all angles and delivers depth with its fun.I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in years if not ever!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Review - The Avengers,"I saw The Avengers on May 17. Personally, I'm not much of a superhero fan, but I quite enjoyed the movie. In my opinion, The Avengers is a pretty good and entertaining movie, and it's a good theatrical experience. James Berardinelli wrote in his review, ""The Avengers kicks ass."" I agree.Over the last few years, five movies have been made - Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor, The Incredible Hulk, and Captain America - which have built up to, and became prequels to, The Avengers. There were even things in those movies that hinted at them all being connected, and now this movie confirms it. The Avengers are all assembled in this film: Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, the Hulk, the Black Widow, and Hawkeye. Yes, they're all played by the same actors, and they have the backgrounds that have been established for most of them in the ""prequels"" mentioned above. The villain in the movie is Loki, who was the villain in Thor, and who now plans on using the Tesseract, a powerful energy cube, to open a portal to another part of the universe and attack the earth with a powerful army. The Avengers are called together by Nick Fury, who runs an agency called S. H. I. E. L. D., and they must stop Loki from carrying out his plans. There's more to the story, but I won't give any more away.I'm sure there are things that can be criticized about the movie. However, it's really not worth it, given there are so many good things about the movie, and the entire experience is very enjoyable, so I'm not going to bother with an in-depth review/criticism. In a way, the film is sort of critic-proof (for lack of a better term). So here's my advice: don't dissect or overly analyze the movie. Just sit back and enjoy it. That's not to say that it's a total Transformers-like junk movie or anything. It's actually halfway decent.The actors put on a good performance and really bring out their characters, and the interactions between the characters are good - the gathering of the different superheroes is handled pretty well. The story is pretty solid, and it's coherent and appropriately paced. The visual and special effects and action scenes are great. Alan Silvestri composed an effective score for the movie. Overall, the movie is halfway decent, it's smart, and it's entertaining, and, unlike many junk films like Michael Bay's, it actually allows for sufficient blockbuster emotional involvement, and it has a good, wise balance between story and action/effects. The two-and-a-half hour running length of the movie pretty much zipped by for me. So, while I don't think this movie is great, it's definitely entertaining and worth seeing, and it's a very good theater experience.My Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A superhero film true to its name.,"Let's be honest. All the previous Marvel films leading to the Avengers were great - story wise, acting wise, effect wise etc. Iron Man I & II, Thor, Captain America all turned out to be (surprise) box office hits, and one can see the point. So, when at the end of every movie, a post credits scene was shown depicting that there is something even greater planned, the expectations were raised pretty high.Joss Whedon (Firefly, Cabin in the Woods) took into account that set expectations, of both comic book fans and non-fans alike, and put together a superhero flick that'll rest proudly as the conclusion to its predecessors. The screenplay writers, the VFX studio, the actors (Robert Downey Jr. has always been my favorite) all deserve credit.An action packed, blockbuster movie that already has every record broken and every voice cheering, The Avengers is one of the best movies this year. A must watch, even if you're not into this stuff. 10 on 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Lacks personality,"While I found the action and story decently pleasing overall, I think the movie spread itself incredibly thin in terms of characterization and as such suffers from a distinct lack of personality. I understand that Marvel thought they could forego character development because each character had their own movie (with the exception of the Hulk, as this version is a reboot), I think that there needs to be a lot more going on in order for the characters to be likable. All of the dialogue is either puns, one-liners, or witticisms, as if the movie is one big joke and the actors are constantly winking at the audience. The action and story are pleasing and well thought out, but the characters are completely lacking.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Some people just love to hate...,"This is the best superhero movie I have ever seen. Full stop.But did you actually read that? Did you get it? This is the best superhero movie I have ever seen.It is about superheroes and it is made with today's technology. Today's technology allows movie makers to design scenes that were technologically impossible before. Any other previous superhero movie I have seen was worse.If you never got into superhero comics then this is not a movie for you.Now back to the summary line. Some (sorry) idiotic reviewers are comparing this movie to: Memento, Blade Runner, Psycho, The Empire Strikes Back, The Matrix, etc. And talking about lack of symbolism, depth, twists, etc. ""This movie doesn't deserve this high rating, etc."" Are you people on drugs?Possible explanations for these 1 star ""punisher"" reviews are: 1 some people just love to hate or 2 they had a bad day or 3 they want to show off their ""expert"" knowledge of ""le cinema"" or 4 they were simply on drugs while watching this movieSo bad news guys: This movie does not have the hyper-realism of ""The Bicycle Thief"", the supreme intrigue of ""Citizen Kane"", the old fashion romance of ""Casablanca"", or the sublime dialogs of ""12 Angry Men"". This is only the best superhero movie I have ever seen.I am 50, I have an engineering degree, my favorite pastime is movies, my favorite genre is Sci-Fi, my favorite movie is Blade Runner and THIS IS STILL THE BEST SUPERHERO COMIC BOOK ADAPTATION I HAVE EVER SEEN (sorry for shouting) and this is why in my review this movie deserves a 9 (not 10 because it is not art).If you want to see an ""artsy"" movie check out ""The Bicycle Thief"" (and take some antidepressants with you).

The most anticipated superhero movie of all time doesn't disappoint.,"The Avengers is quite possibly the most anticipated superhero movie in history, but does it quite live up to the hype?I know that this is the Marvel movie we have all been waiting for. This is the movie that all the others made by Marvel Studios has been leading up to. This is what they have been aching to show us.I was pleased to learn that I would be given the chance to see the movie before its May release date in the United States, but despite my privileged opportunity, I went in with relatively low expectations. (It's just another superhero movie, but with a bunch of them at one time, right?)Wrong...If you are a fan of Marvel, superheroes, great CGI or just all-around intense action films, you MUST see Marvel's The Avengers.The CGI was the best I've seen in a long time, the fighting as intense as ever, and the plot is top-notch. But these things aren't the only aspects of the movie that make The Avengers great. For me, it was the characters.Yes, we've seen all these characters before. We've enjoyed their specific movies, but having them on screen together worked better than I could have imagined.In fact, that was why I was apprehensive at first. I had been afraid that perhaps one hero would take away more screen time than another. (We all have our favorites.) But this wasn't the case.Tony Stark (Robert Downy Jr.), provided his much expected wit and humor for the film, causing the crowd to laugh on many occasions. The banter between Stark and Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) flowed well and added a lot to the character depth.I wasn't sure how Thor (Chris Hemsworth) would be playing his part either. I thought he actually might be taking too much screen time from the others since his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), was the main antagonist, but this wasn't the case.I found myself most excited in the movie when Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) came on screen. His character was done so well for this movie. I found myself thrilled and even scared in some of his scenes.I must also mention here that Ruffalo did a superb job of taking Edward Norton's place as Bruce Banner/ The Hulk. If there's one thing that annoys me about sequels, it's when they change actors, but I actually enjoyed Ruffalo better in this role.Of course you can't forget about Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). Each of them played their part of the story wonderfully, though I found Sam Jackson's acting to be a little stale.I would say that if you haven't watched the other movies made by Marvel Studios that you might want to watch them. Most references will be lost on you if you don't.As far as screen time, it felt like every character got their time in the light. No one person stole the show, and just as Marvel intended, they ALL stole the show.There is one particular scene that I enjoyed where the camera panned to each hero, doing their own special moves, though it's hard to explain further than that without giving anything away. However, there were moments in the movie where I had to lean over to my wife and ask what someone was talking about, but these instances were minor.Obviously, if you care anything about Marvel movies, you're already planning to see The Avengers. If you haven't seen any of the other Marvel Studios films, take a weekend, watch them. Then go see The Avengers. I don't think you'll be sorry you did.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not That Bad,"I enjoyed the movie. Not sure I understand all the platitudes it's getting here. I guess some people are just a bit over stimulated.The movie could've done with a 20 minute cut towards the end to avoid going into 'Micheal Bay' territory. Maybe this time could have been used to further develop the characters and how they relate to each other.The plot was also pretty weak, sometimes it was hard to figure out whether it was Transformers 2 or The Avengers, such was the similarity of pretty much everything at the end (including the aliens and CGI).A solid 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A new benchmark in action Movies!!!,"Action movies will now have a new leader as Avengers assemble by Marvel raises the bar to an entirely new level.The hype made by Marvel in 2011, by Introducing Thor and Captain America to the audience in quick succession just as a precursor for the Avengers ,is lived up and surpassed with what will be one of the beacons in modern era action movies.The boasted budget of $220m,is well spent for the movie expectedly satisfies you as a visual treat with what i think,one of the best CG effects.Also,this one does deserve a heads up to be watched in 3D, unlike annoyingly many in the recent past.Though,the first half has a few more than necessary scenes shot in the dark,but it gets better as the movie progresses.Though the plot is pretty straight-forward,there are so many characters in the movie to keep you entertained in their very own signature fashion.Each and every character is given nearly equal importance and nobody is left out,which is an effort to appreciate. They have really put a lot of efforts in the new Hulk to bring him up to join the party with others,and Boy! it does pay off exceptionally well.Iron Man's powers are tested to a very new level and being the most skilled avenger,they had to be.He has got some new moves, watch out for them!.I am really starting to like Captain America and the way he handles the situation. The time transitioned character of his, adjusts surprisingly quickly to the new scenario.Black Widow and Hawk-Eye who had brushing references in previous movies are full fledged avengers now, but i wish marvel to bring them up in singles.There are a few much needed subtle humorous moments exercising your jaws sideways in between a lot of fantastically choreographed action scenes keeping them dropped down for most of the time.Bout the cast, Downey Jr. undoubtedly stands out as an actor, with his amazing comic timing and the way he carries the arrogance of Iron-Man. The search for Bruce Banner has ended up giving the most subtle hulk yet,with Mark Ruffalo.The Rest of the cast looks just supportive. Cobie Smulders was supposed to be the eye candy,but Scarlett Johansson steals the show in that aspect, not to mention in her alter-ego superhero moves too.All in all, an awesome summer blockbuster with wholesome entertainment. The Avengers is surely one of the best action movies to watch before you leave this dimension.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Here it is, the masterpiece we've been waiting for. :)","I was eagerly waiting for this movie. But after seeing the Marvel movie, Captain America: the first Avenger, Thor and Incredible hulk- I thought that the movie would be not as good as the hype it carried for so many years. But still due to Robert downey jr. i wanted to see this film. OK, i admit it, i was blown away by the movie in terms of Action, and of course Humor.Director Joss Whedon, directed this movie so BRILLIANTLY, that there are very little or NO flaws. Sufficient Screen time has been provided for each of the SUPERHEROES. but the Mighty guys, Iron man(RDJ) and the Hulk(Mark Ruffalo) steal the show. Thor(Chris Hemsworth) was too, brilliant. In this movie, you'll see more of Captain America(Chris Evans) than his solo movie, which is really great. AND, Black Widow(Scarlett Johannson) kicks the ass off whoever she fights with. Hawkeye(Jeremy Renner) is not at all Underused, his Powers were shown superbly. Nick Fury(Samuel L. Jackson) was great with his Initiative. And here it is, the main villain, Loki(Tom Hiddleston), steals the show with his mischievous and No-worries personality, he fits into the role perfectly. On the Whole, the cast were perfect, with each of them fitting into the characters with ease.The humor and witty one liners are splendid. Don't expect it to be DARK with no humor like the Dark knight, instead it wins the heart of each and every person watching the film in the auditorium. Many people have started comparing Avengers with The dark knight, but what I SAY is these two are COMPLETELY different type of film, and comparing the two is not justified. Still if you compare, Avengers is better than Dark knight. Due to the reason that Avengers can be enjoyed by each and every person, it has action and Humor, both at equal Quantities.As for iron man, Robert downey jr IS Iron man, no other person can do that role so perfectly. Unfortunately, RDJ is about to leave the franchise after IRON MAN 3, i request the iron man fans to please him not to leave the franchise for at least another 3 or 4 films, including AVENGERS 2. :)I will ensure to each and every person who is reading this that, this film will never disappoint you, not even a moment. 100%. :) Go watch it without doubt. I will say that, this movie will definitely touch or cross the 1Billion mark and becomes on of the highest grossing films in the film history.Verdict: 10/10 stars, A+++++, EXCELLENT.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
THE Best Movie of The Decade,"""Did anybody see Inception? I think that was just about the most ambitious movie I've ever seen. And then I thought wait a god damn second Marvel Studios is going to take all their top superheroes, and they're going to put them all together in The Avengers. That's the most ambitious movie I've ever seen!"" – Robert Downey Jr. (Comic Con 2010)It may have been the most ambitious movie ever but boy did they pull it off! There was always a small doubt that The Avengers (2012) may have been a flop for a couple of reasons. The first is the fact that the Captain America (2011) and Iron Man 2 (2010) were slightly lower than the standard of movies Marvel studios had shot out since 2008 when The Incredible Hulk (2008) hit the big screens. Obviously this lower standard must have been due to The Avengers being in production because the film topped my list of favourite films and became number 1, yes, it took over The Dark Knight (2008)!To read the full review go here: http://www.teknue.com/reviews/review- the-avengersavengers-assemble-2012/852",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
NOT even close to being the best superhero movie of all time,"When I first saw the trailer for this movie I thought it looked pretty cool, and when the review started coming in I immediately got excited.When I finally got to see the movie I realized after the first 20 minutes that this wasn't the movie I was hoping for. Now let me explain why.I can start off with the script. The script is not good, by adding some over-dramatic, cheesy and boring dialogue doesn't make a movie good. But the script isn't terrible, some of the cheesy comments fits with the dialogue and makes you laugh a little.But the one thing that is directly terrible with this movie is the story. For those of you who don't know the story, it goes like this; Thor's evil brother Loki has come to the earth to claim it as his, and then he gets a thing called the Tesseract, and afters that he opens a portal so his alien army can enter the earth to take control over it. But then Nick Fury brings together the superhero team called ''The Avengers'' to stop him. I don't think it's necessary for me to start explaining why the story is so terrible, most people should understand why.And I know a lot of people have claimed that the film don't need a good script or story because it's so entertaining. Well, I don't agree. The first 1 and a half hours of the movie is really boring, and I actually considered leaving the cinema, but then the movie catch up with some really cool and visually stunning scenes.Some things in this movie was good, like most of the acting, the CGI and some of the dialogue. But overall this is just an average popcorn movie with a superhero flick.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Avengers: An Assembly of Sheer Awesomeness!!!,"From the moment Samuel L Jackson walked in during the post-credits scene of 'Iron Man' four years ago, talking about the 'Avengers Initiative', the whole world has waited for this epic assemblage of some of Marvel's greatest icons! Well, four years and five films later, the Avengers have finally assembled...and, as expected, it was with a wave of sheer awesomeness!Unlike the previous 'Marvel Cinematic Universe' films, 'The Avengers' isn't really into complex plotting here. The premise is simple-Loki, the Asgardian 'God', seeks to facilitate the invasion of Earth by an alien race...and Nick Fury, Director of SHIELD, responds by activating the 'Avengers Initiative', bringing together armored hero Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr. reprising the character for the third time), Loki's 'brother' and Asgardian warrior Thor (Chris Helmsworth), the living legend and man out of time Captain America (Chris Evans), gamma radiations expert Dr. Bruce Banner and his monstrous alter ego the 'Hulk' (both played to perfection by Mark Ruffalo, following in the footsteps of Edward Norton) and clandestine operatives Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). What follows is the usual hero vs. villain fare...albeit on a scale about a BILLION times larger than that of, say, 'Spiderman'. Indeed, one of the greatest moments in the film is a single shot that sweeps across New York City, taken in the battles of each of the six Avengers across the breadth of the Big Apple...a testament to the sheer scale and scope of not only the film itself, but the threat faced by the heroes in-universe.Action and spectacles aside, 'The Avengers' real strength lies in the characterizations of the core characters. Downey Jr. turns in another memorable performance as Tony Stark which was to be expected, and Tom Hiddleton brilliantly essays the megalomaniacal God Loki...but it is newcomer (to the Marvel movie-verse) Mark Ruffalo who really stands out in his dual performance as both scientific genius Bruce Banner and the rampaging Hulk. Ruffalo brings a level of depth to the character, and his inner struggles, which was not immediately evident in performances by previous actors. His Banner is not so much a man on the run from the monster within as he is a man who is starting to learn to accept the monster and use it as a force for good. Samuel L Jackson really gets to shine here as Nick Fury, after his cameos in previous films.On a parting note, there has been an unfortunate tendency, for months, on message boards, blogs and forums across the Internet, to create some kind of a 'competition' between The Avengers and Nolan's upcoming epic, The Dark Knight Rises. Having seen the former, I can safely say that such comparisons are totally uncalled for. The Avengers is not aiming to surpass The Dark Knight Rises any more than Star Wars was aiming to surpass The Godfather. They are two totally different films, belonging to different genres and (literally) whole different universes, and as fans, we need to respect that above all else and enjoy all masterpieces on their own merits!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Finest superhero movie ever,"The Avengers – CATCH IT ( A+ ) The anticipation for the avenger's movie is undeniable. We have been waiting for this from years. To understand the Avenger's movie it's really important that you've seen all previous Ironman, the Incredible Hulk, Thor and Captain America's movies. As the avenger's give time to build characterizations for their heroes so getting into the avengers empty headed about hero's history will be foolish. The Avenger's brings back our beloved Marvel's heroes Tony Stark (Iron Man), Thor, Dr. Bruce Banner (Hulk), Steve Rogers (Captain America), Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow), Clint Barton (Hawkeye), Agent Maria Hill, Agent Phil Coulson and Director Nick Fury. Each hero's journey starts from where it ended in their respective movies. Now, The Avenger's stands strong in every department, from direction, production and performances. It won't be wrong to say that it brings out the best out of all the heroes. The humor, action and graphics are far brilliant than all the previous Marvel movies combined. The credit goes to generous brain of Joss Whedon. He brings out something very special out of each superhero. The interaction between all superheroes is something we don't see often, they tease, make fun and even fight with each other. Robert Downey Jr. (Ironman) is great as always. He brings his charming personality and wicked humor into his character which made him the superstar of today. Chris Hemsworth (Thor) is truly a god of thunder. His entry is as Big as Thor's entry should be, it makes you jump of your seat and cheer for him. Chris Evens (Captain America) is indeed the ultimate American Hero, he got the charm and personality of a true America hero. Some of the most standout moments in the movie belong to Mark Ruffalo (The Incredible Hulk). For the first time we see some humor in the actions of Hulk, he is just not a fury green monster this time around. besides Hulk, the biggest surprise is Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow), we have seen the part of her in Ironman movie but this time around we completely understand the strength and wickedness of Black Widow. She is absolutely stunning and fantastic. Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye) is good and I hope to see him someday with Black Widow. They had this amazing chemistry which requires further attention. Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders and Samuel L. Jackson the S.H.E.I.L.D are fun to watch. Tom Hiddleston (Loki) is superb, he was the ultimate villain and considering his brilliant performance in Thor, he has out done himself again. Gwyneth Paltrow (Pepper Potts) appearance is appreciated and I would have loved to see Natalie Portman (Jane Foster) in it too. On the whole, The Avengers is the finest brilliant superhero movie of all time, it's filled with great performance, humor, action, graphics and brilliant direction. Highly recommended in 3D.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Avengers Review - Ninaad Kothawade - India,"The Avengers (3D-2012) Movie Review-Ninaad Kothawade Director: - Joss Whedon Starring: - Robert Downey Jr. , Chris Hemmingsworth, Scarlett Johansson , Tom Hiddleston , Chris Evans , Mark Ruffalo , Samuel Jackson, Jeremy Renner 2 hour 22 minutesThe most Anticipated and Waited movie of the year 2012. This movie has high expectations from almost everyone Released on 27April Friday Six days before the US release. The Marvel superheroes Thor (Chris Hemsworth) Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) Captain America (Chris Evans) Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) are assembled by the S.H.I.E.L.D. Leader Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) in order to prevent the expected war and fight the emerged Super Villain God of Mischief Loki (Tom Huddleston)! The Immortal Loki Planning a war and aiming Slavery on Earth, has to be defeated by this group of superheros called the Avengers. In order to achieve their target they have to Fight their Superhero Alter Ego and The clashes of their Ally's powers and control them to unify and Save the planet. Nick Fury convinces them all to join the Avengers Initiative ,which later leads to confusion brawl and Fights on the insideAll is taken lightly until the realization and attack on the Base which proves that the whole world is at stake. The Screenplay as well as the Storyline is Amazing, every scene handled with perfection. The Story is well explained and gives a break from the Action which keeps you In the Movie. The Cinematography is Awesome and Exceptional with the Direction and Special Effects Justifies the Storyboard and is Realistic...All the Action Sequences are well Coordinated, Engaging and with popping 3D effects well in place it's a treat to the eye. The Screen Space is shared equally and handled well between the Large Cast... About the Soundtrack it's Average, nothing Extraordinary or Provoking. The movie just misses out somewhere on the Emotions. The Previous releases have already made the Superheroes Familiar and this avoids much confusion. Well Edited and Brilliantly Adapted screenplay makes the most of the Storyline and even handles the major challenge that could have been faced of making Order of Chaos. The much Hyped movie has definitely met the expectations and is perfect blockbuster. Even watch it from some fresh Action from Hulk, Black Widow, and The Hawkeye who don't disappoint you at all. Mark Raffalo's performance and Character is noticeable out of all the other Star Superheroes. No doubt the best superhero movie this Decade. 3 time watch for Comic Superhero Movie fans. 2 time for Super Action Fans. And at least a onetime must watch for every other Hollywood Movie Buff out there.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
2 1/2 hours of wasted time,"I don't want to waste more time talking about a movie that I just wasted 2 1/2 hours of my life watching but I feel it's necessary in order to maybe save someone from making the same mistake I just did by watching this stinker. Actually I slept through some of it so there was SOME valuable time spent in the theater. I would have walked out except my girlfriend look like she was enjoying it. This movie just sucked, plain and simple. It's the typical good guys have to save the earth from aliens. It did have all the emotions though.....The dialog was laughable and the acting made me want to cry. Unless you just like seeing buildings getting demolished and people who are impervious to bullets, explosions, and every kind of weapon known to man, stay home and save your money. I've watched better cartoons as a kid. It actually angers me that there are so many people in this world the simply LOVED this movie.

This film is a MASTERPIECE!,"UK title ""Avengers Assemble""/ Rest-Of-World ""The Avengers"". Just like ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"", this film was eagerly anticipated by fans, such as myself. I could not wait for the film to be released on 26th April. Unlike ""TF3"" however, this film live up to the hype. It surpassed my expectations (and I expected a lot). It didn't feel forced and certainly did not feel like a sequel to one particular lead-up film. It felt like a well-made sequel to ALL the films.The final battle wasn't just an all-out brawl - it seemed integral to the story and characterisation of the film.Every character had their ""time to shine"" and they were as you remember them from their ""build-up"" films - Tony Stark was cocky, witty and likable, Steve Rodgers was patriotic, a ""man-out-of-time"" and focused on the mission and Thor was a demi-god warrior.Then there's the Hulk, played by Mark Ruffalo instead of Ed Norton this time around. This Hulk/Banner was perfect. Ruffalo brought a sense of humour to this famously angry character and really helped pull-off the Hulk where others have either tried and failed (Hulk 2003) or tried and only just failed (The Incredible Hulk 2008).We also got a brief look at Black Widow (Scarlett Johanson)'s background and her relationship with Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Even next to their super-powered team-mates, these two proved their worth to be part of the team.Tom Hiddleston as Loki was brilliant, Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury was what you'd expect from this actor, Clark Gregg was once again great as Phil Coulson and Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill was a good decision and while her performance was good I feel she was underused.This film has and amazing soundtrack, brilliant actors, likable characters (even Loki), great 3D effects, an enjoyable story and epic action. Congratulations and thank you to Director Joss Whedon and the rest of the crew for putting together a masterpiece.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Mega-Blockbuster Conglomeration of Marvel Superheroes!,"The Avengers is a clean-burning, six-cylinder entertainment - a wall-to-wall action bonanza, executed with a fluid coherence. It laughs in the face of expectation and instead sets its own bar that all blockbusters need to follow.Following on from the first Thor flick, the demi-god's evil brother Loki (a deliciously fiendish Tom Hiddleston) is intent on subjugating humanity with the help of an all-powerful energy cube that'll allow him to bring his alien armies to Earth. Trouble starts when this glowing cube of untold power called the Tesseract is appropriated by Loki, who with a nudge from his magic assegai brain-zaps a snap marksman Hawkeye (a competent Jeremy Renner) and a top scientist into his evil scheme of world domination. All that stands in his way is Nick Fury (the ever reliable Samuel Jackson), the head of the covert peacekeeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D. who sets about uniting the world's superheroes to avert the threat, rounding up our titular team - Iron Man (a hilarious Robert Downey Jr.), The Hulk (a subversively charming Mark Ruffalo), Thor (the charismatic Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (a sincere turn by Chris Evans) and Black Widow (the sexy but earnest Scarlett Johansson) – hoping they will be greater than the sum of their parts. Problem is, they're a dysfunctional outfit, with differences of opinion and troubled pasts, and one of them is a gigantic, green loose cannon. Now, with a global catastrophe looming, they must subsume individual will to the collective good. But Loki isn't called 'the god of mischief' for nothing! Before Fury's new super team can find its balance, Loki is in their heads sowing seeds of doubt, distrust, anger and conflict. Can earth's mightiest heroes put their differences aside in time to protect the planet – or is their coming together an even bigger threat than Loki himself?The Avengers doesn't buckle under the weight of its gargantuan expectations and overflowing cast, largely because of Joss Whedon. He weaves all of the powder-keg moments into a story that is meaningful and always makes sense. The point in The Avengers is to bring six separate characters together as a team without sacrificing their individuality and by extension their value as solo franchises and Whedon does an excellent job of keeping the disparate personalities of his protagonists in play. Whedon's script sparks up the exposition with some sparkling dialogue, high stakes and balls- to-the-wall action spectacle. If you don't believe me, check out the thrilling alien-bashing finale on the streets of Manhattan - it is a pure fan boy wet-dream.Smart, funny, pulsating and surprisingly cathartic, Joss Whedon succeeds in appeasing its core fanbase. From ambition to scale to the way it justly balances each remarkable character, The Avengers is utterly stimulating, satisfyingly scripted and damn right faultless big screen entertainment. The Avengers make us do something increasingly rare in these over-franchised times - root for a sequel. Go smash!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Feel Like A Kid Again - Go See The Avengers!,"I know there's comic book fans that have their favorites. There's also the film fans that have their own favorites. There are also some who are so enamored and in love with The Dark Knight that they will pounce on any film that is considered ""better"". For me, I've never been a big comic book guy but I do enjoy a good film adaptation of them. I can love The Dark Knight AND Iron Man. I don't have a bias. I enjoy several of these type of films regardless of the company, brand, or filmmaker.For me, I absolutely love The Avengers. It brought out the little kid in me. At 33, cynical and disgruntled, that's a major compliment. I understand that the film is by no means perfect but it was just so much damn fun. It made me want to buy a costume and play make believe in the backyard again. But again, I'm 33, so I mean that figuratively. I just really had a blast with this and this is the best theater experience I've had since seeing a Star Wars movie. I loved it and can't wait to see it again.So, for those who have hang-ups about how you don't want to hear its better or more popular than this or that, don't get caught up in that nonsense. Who cares where people rank The Avengers or Iron Man or The Dark Knight or what have you? It doesn't matter. So, just do yourselves the favor of seeing this movie. It is just a boatload of fun.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spectacular & Historic,"This film is not only spectacular but its an ""historic"" superhero feature film at its best. This is worth the wait. Hell, this was worth the wait 7 years ago when it was first developed. Do we really think this will be in development hell? This is The Avengers ""EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES!"" This is something what has NEVER been done before & Marvel has got there finger on the pulse. In 1998, a minor marvel character featuring a human/vampire hybrid made it way to the big screen. In 2000, a group of mutants evolved into the box office. In 2002, was the year of the Spider.After Daredevil, Hulk (Ang Lee), The Punisher, Elektra, Man-Thing, Fantastic Four & Ghost Rider, Marvel Studios would start producing its own films and distribute them through Paramount Pictures & the funding will come from a seven-year, $525 million revolving credit facility with Merrill Lynch. The result led to the creation of the ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"". Sounds cool, right? It was. No, really, It F***in' was. Iron Man made its motion picture debut, The Hulk got rebooted, Thor & Captain America have ""FINALLY"" got the Big screen treatment. Then came a huge shift in the Marvel universe.... Marvel Entertainment is now owned by Mickey Mouse.Amazing. Disney let go the Power Rangers franchise & bought Marvel.But after everything from comics to TV & film Marvel has put out it comes to show just how far they come as a company & knowing the fact that the biggest supporters (including me) are the fans. That is why they CAN NOT Disappoint us. Yeah, we complain about story lines, costumes & special effects, But if they stay true to the comics, the films would have done its justice. But i know deep down, Marvel Studios will always put out films & stay close to the material. So, what i've said earlier, was it worth the wait? Yes. Yes it was ""definitely"" worth it.Marvel Studios, the cast & crew of The Avengers did an amazing job & on the Marvel Cinematic Universe & i can't wait to see what comes next.Now if DC & Warner Bros. step their game up, we would like to see the Justice League into the big screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not just the best superhero movie ever, but one of the best movies ever","I saw this movie at a midnight show. I had been looking forward to this movie for years and I was so pumped for it. After it was over, I feel like my mind exploded from the pure awesomeness and amazement that this film brought. Up until I saw this movie, ""The Dark Knight"" was my favorite superhero movie, but ""The Avengers"" beat it. How can you expect less from a movie that has Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, and Thor in it? It was the perfect blend of drama, action and comedy. Joss Whedon did what, in my opinion, no other director could have done. The pressure and hype surrounding this movie was immense and it delivered in every way. ""The Avengers"" is the type of movie that EVERYONE can enjoy, not just comic book fans.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An Epic Letdown,"Before I say everything that was wrong with the movie, I will first say that I am familiar with the comics and source material, and have thought all the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies so far were decent. My personal favorite is Ironman 1, one of my favorite movies overall, because of the way it told the story and how it maintained more realism than the other movies in the franchise series of Marvel movies. Physics, engineering, and basic foundations of life were followed while telling the story of Tony Stark. Everything, while elaborate, seemed possible. Possible is the key word.I grew up watching Bill Bixby be the Incredible Hulk with Lou and thought the show was awesome. I do know, though, that technology wasn't around the make Hulk be what the comic wanted him to be. The Hulk movie therefore was decent but nothing I am dying to watch again. Captain America and Thor were decent too.So what was I expecting when I saw Avengers? I was expecting the 1992 Dream Team. I was expecting a movie that would be epic in every way where each character was maximized to their fullest while trying to solve a deep plot similar to The Watchmen or even the recent Dark Knight Trilogy. I got neither. The plot, in my opinion, was way too simplified and even worse, all the characters seemed to be more forgettable.I will say some of the casting was quite poor and didn't flow with the original intent of the characters and some were just annoying in their roles. Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner, in particular, were very unwatchable even though like Lost in Translation and The Hurt Locker.Overall, I can see how this movie made so much money. It is the perfect movie to take younger kids and comic book fans. It is actually even better for those that don't know the source material because they are coming into the movie fresh. However, this is no Dark Knight type of movie with the depth of plot, real-world story lines, or the perfect casting. I give it 7/10 and hope Avengers 2 is a lot better executed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Beautifully Done Masterpiece,"I'll admit it, I was extremely doubtful about this film. I've loved Joss Whedon's work my entire life and I had enjoyed all the previous Marvel films that led up to this one, especially Iron Man. But the fact that they brought together all of these different characters from all these different movies and put them together in 2 1/2 hour film was unprecedented and almost seemed impossible. But the optimist in me got me to the theater with me expectations shaky. Once the film started I was quickly drawn in and once the title appeared on the screen I knew that Joss Whedon had done it. The Avengers is without a doubt my favorite Marvel film and even my favorite action film ever made. Whedon did a great job writing this masterful, witty script that ingeniously put together all these characters and made it flow perfectly. The actors did such a great job playing these characters again and it didn't seem like anyone was underutilized and everyone got a chance to be in the spotlight(especially the hulk). Once you see all of the characters assemble and fight the bad guys you can't help but fill with happiness. The entire movie was such a fun thrill ride from the beginning to the end and the ending battle scene was brilliantly done. I am extremely delighted to say that Joss Whedon has done the impossible and made one of the most entertaining movies ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Big thumbs up for The Avengers,"Loved this movie, even at almost 3 hours long it didn't drag. Joss Wheddon (Firefly and Buffy) effortlessly out did all of the battle scenes in every Transformer movie with the climatic showdown. there are even two or three seriously laugh out loud moments, mostly concerning The Hulk, but don't worry the film takes itself fairly seriously so you can escape into the story and immerse yourself.Fans of Ironman, Thor and Captain America will not be disappointed. Every one of the superheroes gets their moment in the sun. And of course, there's Scarlett's character Black Widow. YUM! I'm giving the movie 10/10 (2D HD version) because it's so entertaining and it fulfilled all my expectations. You won't be disappointed.As far as the format goes though, stick with HD, there wasn't any real 3D moments. If you are hugely into your 3D experience, think twice before paying the extra, there wasn't any stand out 3D moments, but lots of out of focus backgrounds which kinda wasted the small fortune that must have been spent on production. Go HD you'll get a better experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

THE AVENGERS (9.5 out of 10),"As AWESOME as expected. An immense lineup/casting, decent story and visuals that put Transformers blur to shame. Iron Man does take a fair chunk of the limelight, as expected (It felt like this was his third film, before that has even been released) but the others do get their fair share and have great entrances.Oh..the movie is very funny!! Iron man starts off initially, but Hulk sees to it, that he gets the last laugh.. and his latter scenes do dominate the tail end (Mark Ruffalo does a pretty decent job) Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye (seen briefly in Thor) makes Oliver's Green Arrow from DC, look pathetic. This movie along with his role in Mission Impossible 4 is definitely a precursor to his taking over the role as Bourne, and he's pumping up for that too.Speaking of the muscles in the film. ""Cap"" appears to have lost weight?? Chris Evans must not be working out as much, but Thor seems to have taken over in the gym as he's even bigger. Hulk is obviously the biggest but thats what CGI does for you.. Oh, and Iron Man appears bulkier?? like his suit needs to compete??! Scarlett Johannsson's ass get's a cameo in this film, I wonder how she felt about the camera's angle in all the 3D glory in one scene..Another new member to the cast, and good to see another Avenger's regular ~ Agent ""Maria Hill"" appears, played by a very fit looking Cobie Smulders (Robin from ""How I met your mother"" fame) She gets a fair chunk of the movie and action herself. Stellan Skarsgaard returns from Thor along with the villain most would have seen in the trailer, Loki. Potts & Coulson cameo.The ""one on one"" battles of many of the heroes is a sight to behold and are really a delight to watch. You get to see them throw everything at each other as you see them match up their strengths and their weaknesses. Also watch for the Cap / Iron Man combo towards the end of the film, memories from the past! Loved the film. Will no doubt be seeing it again..

Good But Not Great; Wonder Why it is in IMDb top films!,"I would give it 7 or 7.5 out of 10. It is a very good film, but nothing great. Believe me or not.I watched it yesterday night at the South Delhi PVR Priya Cinema Hall (3D; hated their scratchy defective glasses which needed changing for many people).The first half was just okay (actually even boring) and the intermission point was so ill-timed and then the second half was good. The fight scenes in the city (Manhattan) are like the latest Transformers. A one time watch for sure; but don't expect much.I liked the film but not as much as I had expected it to like! There are many enthralling scenes but the number of boring frames (particularly in the first half) is also abundant. The villain is not so menacing or dignified (like the all-powerful villain of X-Men 3). He needed more teeth.And I am not alone in thinking so; five of my friends with me have similar opinion.

Simply Perfect,"I can not say anything more about THE AVENGERS; the movie just hit all the right spots and a lot more. It didn't only entertain like how a brainless popcorn movie would; it told a great superhero team story.The characters were written perfectly, the action was spectacular and best of all ever character was a joy to watch. The story had the perfect balance of comedy, action and drama (yes, there's a bit of that too and it's good). It's everything a comic book fan would want out of a comic book adaptation movie.Every member of the Avengers line-up (whether super powered or not) got the right amount of screen time; if you were like me and thought that Iron Man would get accidentally hog the screen because the trailers made the movie look like ""IRON MAN AND FRIENDS,"" your fears will be washed away. Mark Ruffalo also stole the show as Banner/ The Hulk; if you had a few doubts about him playing the character after Edward Norton was left behind, fear not since he does the job well. I can go as far as saying that Ruffalo is the best incarnation of Banner so far.Josh Whedon pulled off the impossible; he wrote and directed a perfect comic book adaptation.

How did this get in the top 100?,"This film is is an empty shell covered with dazzling lights. Sure, it does look pretty but that is as far as it goes.Nothing interesting happens in this film (by interesting I mean plot wise, not a standard fight scene with new people copied and pasted into it) the 'plot' is horrific, to the point in which you wonder if there actually is a one. Hollywood seem to use the same script for every action film they make, only they replace a few of the more minor details so hopefully people won't notice.In an attempt to keep at least some of the male (and select female) audience awake the director decides it is time for Scarlett Johansson to pop up on screen to show off her, lets say defining costume in such an obvious manner. It is just a cheap, cheap film full of filler material that you will enjoy if you have an inability to think for yourself.I really have no idea how this film got into the top 100 of all time, there is really no reason for it to be there.The only plus sides are that the acting and cast are superb, it is just a shame that they were not involved in something where their talents could have been used in more fulfilling roles.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Everything you would want to see..,"They spend money to make a film you would enjoy. You pay money to see a movie and enjoy. This is a movie where every penny spend by the producers and the consumers is worth spend. Movies with so many superheroes are 90% of the time destined to be a chaos. Yes there is chaos, but its not the movie but in the heart of Manhattan which is the battleground.Awesome dialogues, rightly timed humor and incredible action. You wouldn't have time to chew your popcorn. People who have come to IMDb to check for reviews, just don't spend time here...get a ticket now.Watch it in 3D.

"An amazing star-cast, well-paced direction and a brilliant story !!!","""Amazing"", would be a one word review for this movie!I went on to the cinema yesterday and was excited enough to have watched the trailers more than 30 to 40 times and was thinking, how would Marvel / Joss Whedon contain any of these characters in such a short story (last for about 142 min) when each of them were brilliant enough to grip me in 130-150 minutes of their own (in Iron Man 1 & 2, Thor, Captain America). But Mr. Whedon knew what he wanted from the story and has clearly demarcated his territory.This has to be the best superhero movie till date. Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man / Stark) has been ecstatic in his own witty and superb dialogue delivery, Chris Hemsworth (Thor) is, well, strong and manly, Chris Evans (Captain America) has acted like a true captain specially at the latter part of the movie and between all the action and a surprise, Hulk has smashed everything and has been fun too, for a delightful change. I really think Mark Ruffalo (The Hulk) is the key ingredient which would make people jump on their seats and has added to the fun and excitement to this amazing roller coaster of a movie.I delightfully give this a 10 out of 10 (I hope there was a 11 possible) for allowing me to witness a 2 and a half hour roller coaster, without a break!!!Watch it, if you want to know how Superhero movies should be!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Words cannot describe how good this movie is!! A MUST SEE,"I have to say this movie was out of this world. Exactly what any big fan of comics or of all the marvel movies wanted. There was just enough of every character involved. I know a large debate can be had on the characters not being like they are in the comics or the plots being different but behind it all they cant just make a really long boring movie with every detail involved!! Its definitely not a movie for the person who doesn't like the previous movies. The acting of Robert Downey Jr was brilliant and the addition of the new hulk Mark Ruffalo was even better. It could been debated that Ed Norton would of been better but if you ask me personally the new hulk was outstanding! The movie experience in 3D was also very good. I am not a huge fan of 3D movies from the past, but after watching the avengers, marvel did a great job in all the action scenes where they took full use of the 3D effects. Over all its a must see action/adventure movie. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Predictable story, visual masterpiece","I was drawn into watching this movie by the promising graphics more than anything else. I'm not a comic book aficionado in the least, so I went into the movie without any of that background knowledge. Nor did I need it, as I soon found out. There's enough back story inserted to get folks through & the back story of the characters isn't really integral to the story, I thought.The plot was VERY predictable. There was nothing new or original about it. Can easily see where the story is heading and pretty easy to guess how it will end. So, in that regard, I'd give the movie a 1 out of 10.Where this film shines -- and is downright amazing -- are the majority of the graphics. Fantastically intricate CGI work! From that aspect, I'd give the movie a 9 out of 10.So, basically, this is a great one if you're looking for mindless entertainment as the story line isn't a challenge to follow. Definitely a feast for the eyes!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Surprisingly very good!,"It was a surprise that I actually liked Marvel's The Avengers. My expectations were a film about a bunch of superheroes exercising their powers for the sheer amusement of the comic-book fans. Indeed, I was right about the exercise of power (naturally enough) but the way such showing-off was employed is what I like about the film. While, on the surface the events may seem to revolve about a group of mentally immature superheroes, there are several references to a deeper meaning, presented in a hilarious, light way with focus on both action and dialogue alike.The undertone found in The Avengers has to do with the current universal trend of freedom and rebels. Loki makes it clear that his purpose is to fix the 'problem' which earth inhabitants have of misunderstanding the meaning of 'freedom' claiming they 'are made to be ruled'. Also, there is an indirect mention of fallen regimes, in general, and particularly the fall of the Soviet Union. Though this subject is not dealt with depth, it gives some weight to the light nature of the film. A film about superheroes is not expected to tackle serious issues but, at the same time, films whose main aim is to entertain the viewer should still not be an embodiment of triviality as is the case in many comedies of the last few years.This is delivered through a balance between action and dialogue. The film is action-packed like a superhero film should be, though this does not come at the expense of dialogue; action sequences are supported by the amazing CGI (with a special nod to the resemblance between Dr Banner and the Hulk). Dialogue, similarly, plays an important role in the development of events and the relationship between the characters.Wittily, this is coated with a fair amount of good humour. Though some jokes could be predictable, the spontaneity of the performances makes them, unarguably, funny. For example, towards the end, when Rogers is giving orders to policemen, what follows is pretty predictable but the spontaneity of the policeman made viewers laugh despite themselves. Non-verbal humour even mounts to a point when viewers clapped hard – when Dr Banner's 'other guy'shut Loki up with a slight movement of his huge arms.Such elements gather, in the end, to make a film that, successfully, transcends the circle of comic-book fans, delivering one of the best films of the season.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The start of something special,"The Avengers is a groundbreaking film that truly marked the beginning of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Directed by Joss Whedon and featuring a star-studded cast of superheroes, including Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, and Captain America, the movie succeeds in bringing together all of these larger-than-life characters in a meaningful and thrilling story.The movie's storyline is engaging, entertaining, and perfectly executed. It has a great sense of pacing, starting with small moments of character development and growing into a high-stakes battle between the protagonists and antagonist, Loki. The action sequences are top-notch, and the movie's ability to balance humor and drama is exceptional.The cast brings their A-game to the table, and each actor perfectly embodies their respective character, providing the audience with some unforgettable performances. Robert Downey Jr. Is fantastic as Iron Man, Tom Hiddleston is the perfect casting choice as the charismatic villain, Loki, and Mark Ruffalo is memorable in his debut as the Hulk. Together, they create a dynamic that was a real treat to watch on screen.Whedon's direction is brilliant, and his writing is exemplary, managing to weave the different storylines of each character into a cohesive story. The movie's amazing cinematography and stunning visual effects also add an extra layer of excitement to the story.One of the greatest strengths of The Avengers is its ability to appeal to both comic book fans and casual moviegoers alike. It's a movie that can be enjoyed by everyone and has helped spawn a new era of superhero movies. The Avengers is one of the rare movies that mark a turning point in cinematic history, and it has spawned some fantastic sequels and spin-offs over the years.In conclusion, The Avengers is an amazing film that marks the true beginning of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It has set a high standard for superhero movies, balancing humor and drama with great characters and an exciting storyline to create an unforgettable cinematic experience. It's easily one of the best superhero movies ever made, and a must-watch for anyone who enjoys great cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good but inherently flawed,"This is a good film but the current overall IMDb score of 8.9 is rather high.Put simply its entertaining and fun. However the problem inherent in the film is how to fit so many larger than life characters into one story and give them equal screen time. Whedon manages to do it but as a result i feel the story had to fit the characters rather than the characters fit the story. There are a lot of new character relationships that have to be established. It gets a little bit convoluted trying to keep up with itself.The threat facing the avengers, i.e Loki and his rather randomly sourced army, just seems a bit cobbled together. Especially the army! Where they came from or what they are doesn't seem properly explained. Just that Loki somehow has one. The threat the Avengers face seems more to do with sheer numbers of bad guys rather than any particularly interesting powerful individual villains. Loki on his own just doesn't seem that threatening. He is wonderfully without remorse though. Bitter and twisted by his quest for revenge. One of his scenes with black widow is almost like Hannibal Lector and Clarice in Silence of the Lambs.Black widow for my money is the most entertaining and interesting character in the film. Maybe its because she doesn't actually have any super powers that makes her so. What she does have is an exceptional mind, attitude and rather scary hand to hand combat skills. Played wonderfully by Scarlet Johannson she is a pleasure in practically every scene.One of the other pleasurable things about this film is the occasionally very funny dialogue and scenes. Whedon is a master of witty fast paced exchanges and he doesn't disappoint here. The cinema audience laughed hard many times. The Hulk having the two biggest laughs in the film.This is a decent film which could have went horribly wrong. A lot of lead characters vying for screen time is a problem. Time spent establishing new relationships also. Perhaps the next one will be more compelling? The film isn't overly subtle but then what did i expect given the nature of its premise!?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very Boring & Disappointing,"Oh my god ! .. The Avengers was a big disappointment to me ! I can't believe how doll and bored I was during the 2 hours and 20 minutes playtime of the movie ..The directing was so bad and I think the director thinks the audience are so stupid or retarded to believe those cheap story lines or cheap jokes or even cheap plot .. The script was so cheap and boring and the characters didn't blend with each other at all ..I'm not even impressed by the special effects of the movie .. I think X-Men 3 or Spider Man showed a lot more special effect than this one .. I nearly enjoyed the last scene of the entire movie but this was not enough for such a movie who earned unbelievable high ratings ..Finally, when I knew that the director has never directed such super hero movies and he has only directed for the TV (like Buffy series), I know why this movie sucked !! still can't believe how it got 8.6 really !!",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I also love how marvel did movies before this one so the characters could be developed. The casting choices were also great. Everyone fits perfectly as the character they were chosen to play.

The Avengers - Better than The Dark Knight?,"The Avengers has been in development for years. Ever since I saw Iron Man for the first time and saw that after credits sequence for the first time, I knew something huge was about to happen. Now four years later, it is finally happening. Marvel brought together Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, The Incredible Hulk, Black Widow, and Hawkeye to form the Avengers. The film is written and directed by Joss Whedon who is known to be a legend with TV shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Firefly, Angel, and Dollhouse. Now this has been my most anticipated film of 2012 for a long time and every trailer has gotten me more pumped than the previous one. Well, I finally saw it at the New York IMAX 3D fan screening (one of 10 that was being held across the country) and I have to say that I may make some bold statements in this review, but I fully believe in them. The Avengers is gonna be a really tough film to beat for not just the best superhero film of the year, but the best film of the year in general.I really have nothing but praise for The Avengers. It's everything that I wanted it to be and more. After four years of following Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor and Captain America, Marvel and Joss Whedon brought everything full circle for whats sure to be a critical and financial success. It's funny, emotional, a visual spectacle, and just everything that makes a perfect superhero movie. I cannot wait to go see it again on May 4th.Overall, I give The Avengers an A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great Movie and Easily the New King of the Genre,"Everything has converged perfectly, delivering what is now the new king of the genre. The Avengers is certainly the best overall comic adaptation film ever made. Really, how could it not be? They positioned this thing with FIVE other set up films that were each remarkable in their own right. Not only does it all come together but I'm happy to say this amazing cast delivers in every way. Believe it or not, every single character featured previously in those five films gets time to really shine at one point or another in this astounding movie. Even though the set up has been epic, the result was anything but assured. It would have been easy to be overwhelmed by the task of putting all these great character together and making it click but they pulled it off perfectly. Maybe it's because the characters themselves are complex and intriguing and that they have been brought to three dimensional life by people that really care. Whatever the case, EVERYONE hits a home run here. They fleshed out perfect cohesion while remembering to include the fun and humor that have made those other five films good. If you define those films as good then you'll define Avengers as great. It's a unified step up and I didn't think that possible. What's also amazing is that I think this movie works without having seen any of those other films. Then, the fun factor will be enjoyed by those that didn't care about the other movies. The depth and amazement will come from those that have invested in to this universe. What they've done is transcend any other of this genre's films by going deeper and doing so in spectacular fashion with Oscar caliber performances. Again, easily the new king of the genre.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Absolutely Brilliant,"The danger with every superhero movie is that it will end up either horrifically unrealistic or unappealing to anyone over the age of ten. I am pleased to say that 'The Avengers' does not fall into either of these pitholes - in fact, it has to be awarded the title of one of the best films of 2012.The actors were all amazingly casted in their respective roles and do an amazing job of creating intriguing and lovable characters. Many of them were reprising roles they had taken on in previous films - Captain America, Thor or Iron Man, for example - so we already had a good idea of how they would perform, but I feel they all exceeded expectations. Robert Downey Jr was incredible as the humorous yet conflicted Tony Stark/ Iron Man, and Chris Evans was brilliant as the confused, out-of-time Steve Rogers/ Captain America. Mark Ruffalo, the newbie of the cast, stepped into the role of Bruce Banner/ Hulk with great skill and dispersed all doubts as to his suitability. On the other side, Tom Hiddleston really has to be congratulated for his convincing and somehow relatable performance as the villain Loki, whose wit and tricks appealed to fans everywhere.The special effects in this movie were undoubtedly excellent, and despite their need to be ostentatious never seemed unnecessarily unrealistic. The director Joss Whedon did a fabulous job and has created a cinematic classic that will be praised for years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

It might seen a little ""over-powered"" but the feeling you get, watching all of these personalities fight together, makes it work.

Best summer movie of 2012,"Not much to say about this one that hasn't been said millions of times before. Brilliant comic-based movie that is, for me personally, the second best Marvel movie ever made, right behind Howard the Duck (kidding, kidding the first Iron Man film obviously). Joss Whedon further proves, as if any more evidence was needed, that as a writer/director he's amongst the top of his field. This is also the best Hulk film ever made and makes it more of a shame that the ball was dropped so badly in his own films. Bruce Banner is the stand out, but all the main superheroes have their very memorable moments, save for Hawkever whom is woefully underused and I hope his role is a tad flashed out on the upcoming extended cut.But really my minor gripes about the movie are few and far between. Loved this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""The Avengers"" is finally here...  There is no other way to say it: This film is AWESOME!","For the past four years, Marvel Studios has been building a cinematic mythology based on their comic books, for the first time combining different franchises into a single canonical movie-universe. Starting in 2008 with ""Iron Man"" and ""The Incredible Hulk"", to 2010's ""Iron Man 2"" and finally last year's ""Thor"" and ""Captain America"", there have been five films building in anticipation to this result- the ultimate crossover experience. In addition to those four heroes, we are also given Black Widow, Hawkeye and Nick Fury, bringing our team of heroes to about seven. (Although Fury isn't a direct player, so I suppose the team stands at six)This movie had a lot to live up to.It succeeded. By god, this was an awesome movie!Directed and co-written by Joss Whedon, 2012's ""The Avengers"" is perfect payoff for fans who have been anticipating this film for over four years now.Beginning with Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) arriving at a SHIELD HQ, the Tesseract (the Asgard artifact used by Red Skull in last year's ""Captain America), which has been under lock-down for testing, opens a portal, allowing Loki (Tom Hiddleston) the outcast brother of Thor to arrive on Earth. He steals the Tesseract and uses his powers to brainwash several SHIELD members (including Hawkeye, portrayed by Jeremy Renner). It is revealed that Loki needs to the Tesseract to open a portal to allow an alien race to invade and conquer Earth.Realizing they are in over their heads, Fury calls out to unite the three Earthly heroes- Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans). After the team apprehends Loki, his brother Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is sent back to Earth, completing our team.When Loki escapes and is finally able to open the portal, the four heroes (joined by Scarlet Johansson as Black Widow and a redeemed Hawkeye) must band together, despite their differences, to defend the world in an ultimate battle.The acting in this film is outstanding. This really begins with our four leads. There is no need to speak about Downey, he continues to play the role to perfection. Hemsworth and Evans also are given a lot of good material to work with. In particular Evans, who gives the character of Steve Rogers subtle pain and pathos this time around despite having to be strong. But the real revelation is Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner. I thought both Eric Bana and Edward Norton had given fine, first-class performances. Particularly Norton, who really made the role his own in a big way. But Ruffalo surprisingly blows them both out of the water. He makes the role of Bruce Banner (and the Hulk thanks to motion-capture technology) his own, giving him humor and an incredible depth. Ruffalo is OWED his own Hulk movie now.In addition the supporting performances are incredible. The gorgeous Johansson is given a lot more to do in this film, and she breaths a great life into Black Widow. To be honest, Black Widow was at times more compelling than our four leads, and Johansson proves once again to be a phenomenal actress. Clark Gregg reprises his ""Iron Man"" and ""Thor"" role as SHIELD agent Phil Coulson, and provides some great comedic moments, in addition to being the shady government type. Hiddleston is menacing and dark as Loki. Stellan Skarsgard and Gwenyth Paltrow return in small roles as Erik Selvig and Pepper Potts, and although their scenes are minor, both ground the film emotionally. The only slight problem I had was with Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye. I will say, he gave a fine performance, but his role seemed... somewhat underwritten in comparison with everyone else. He felt a little too expendable a character and shoe-horned in. But Renner was still good in the role.The script by Whedon (from a story he co-wrote with Zak Penn) is tight, concise and an absolute blast. There is a lot of humor (and I do mean a lot) and a ton of action, although it never feels forced, contrived or unneeded. As fantastical as the story is, it is grounded in it's own sort of reality and logic, and feels natural. This is an extremely well-written, fun and generally light-hearted film.The visuals are a blast. Whedon's direction and camera placement is fun, kinetic and serves as a good companion piece to the other four directors who had previously helmed the individual films. The effects are outstanding. The sound design is great. The score by Alan Silvestri is fun and memorable.This is just a competently made film, and a darned-fine piece of entertainment!I will say that this isn't necessarily the best film in the series (I think the first ""Iron Man"" felt a tad more fresh and unique), but this is still an absolute blast, and you cannot afford to miss it on the big screen!I give ""The Avengers"" a near-perfect 9 out of 10!

The best superhero movie I've ever seen,"The Avengers is the definition of a perfect superhero film as it ticks all the boxes when it comes to humor, action, drama and even emotion. Not only did Joss Whedon understand how to tell any interesting superhero story, but he added weight to it by giving each of the main characters a reason to be there. The plot might seen simple at first, but in reality gives you more than what you asked for. The interactions between the characters are amazing and is the reason why I love these big superhero team films. Loki is one of the best comic book movie villains as he not only gets under the Avengers' skin, but also is able to tear them apart, which leads to internal and external conflicts. Robert Downey Jr is the far the star of the movie as he maintains Iron Man's personality through out the film at a consistent level. If you're looking for a really fun and exciting blockbuster, The Avengers might just be that film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Gem of an Action Movie,"The Avengers (2012)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Nick Fury brings together Iron Man, the Incredible Hulk, Captain America, Hawkeye and Black Widow to join forces and do battle against an enemy that threatens global security in this rather amazing comic book adaptation. I'll be honest and admit that comic book movies aren't my #1 type of film and it wasn't until just a month before THE AVENGERS opened that I bothered to check out the casts supporting movies. I enjoyed the two IRON MAN movies, thought THOR was very good, THE INCREDIBLE HULK was entertaining and I found CAPTAIN America to be decent but no matter what I felt about those films it couldn't prepare me for how much I enjoyed this one. Director Joss Whedon has created something incredibly special and you really can't help but think he's raised the super hero bar so high that many future films are going to have problems reaching it. When bringing all of these characters together, the filmmakers could have taken an easy route and just give us mindless action but that wasn't the case here as Whedon really delivered a deep but easy to follow story and he knew how to have fun with it. The constant banter between the superheroes could have led to some very unfunny moments but the screenplay was so smart in allowing each of their personalities to come through and then added the fun of taking those personalities and throw them at one another. This banter really turned into something incredibly funny and allowed for some great one-liners as well as some terrific action. When it comes to these type of movies I usually complain about a couple things. One is the obvious CGI but that wasn't a problem here because it just looked so realistic that it never took you out of the story and instead it put you more directly into it. Another thing I usually complain about in recent mainstream movies are the expanded running times. THE AVENGERS clocks in at 142-minutes, which made me nervous going in but it turns out that this film proves long running times are okay as long as you have enough to support it and this movie does. In fact, the long running time felt extremely short as the film flies by without any problems. Say what you will about comic adaptations but there's no question that THE AVENGERS is first rate entertainment thanks in large part to the great direction, the detailed writing and each of the performers fitting their roles and bringing them to life. This here is without question a complete success so future comic movie makers had better step their game up.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Hyped, yet solid.","The Avengers is exactly what I feared it would be, nothing more than a typical superhero action movie. In contrast to Nolan's Batman films, it feels weak and shell-less. Sure, there are radical action scenes and the film is in many ways true to the comics. However, it is not, what its recently and often alleged, a masterpiece. It is just like many previous films, hard-cooked popcorn action (surely inspired by Transformers effects) but not more than that. The lack of manusscript, depth, sound track, pace and sometimes actor-performance is no where near a masterpiece.

Attack of the creatures of another dimension,"I am a big fan of science fiction. I have not been such a big fan of all movies based on comic books. I am not such a big fan of sequels either. The Avengers was a must-see-film for me, for several reasons, but most of all, I enjoyed both Iron Men, Captain America, and a bit of Thor as well. Hulk did not do the trick to me.The Avengers brings all these superheroes together. Their opponent is Thor's evil half-brother, Loki. His main goal is to get a magical stone, or cube, that would open the gateway to another dimension, to Asgard, where other, even more evil forces await to be released, and freed to the world of the humans.The action in the film, along with the SFX, is great. However, the storyline is not something you have not seen or heard before. Actually, there is very little new to the film. Also the decision to get all the superheroes or stars together, does not really differ much from Expendables, which is somewhat huge phenomenon, even though the script could be written by a 12-year-old.The Avengers is a lot better than Expendables, but that does not mean, it is a whole lot better, and that it would be better than, lets say Iron Man. For me Iron Man alone stands above The Avengers. The film does not come better with bigger explosions, and a lot more heroes, than in the original film. But obviously, with fans of the 80's stars in Expendables, it is enough to bring them all on the screen at once.What I truly enjoyed in this film was actually a few parts of the action. The one with Thor dropping out from the sky, or the parts in the end, with the heroes pretty much destroying most of the city-site.All in all, it is certainly a-must-see for the fans of comic stars, science fiction, and action.

Crash bang wallop,"I don't usually comment on a film for which I'm completely neutral, but this film deserves a neutral comment as it's such a waste of time and money.

She should be tall and willowy.

A totally boring, endless and mostly witless movie aimed at brain-deadened people who think that special effects, explosions and fantasy but definitely not fantastic characters make for a great movie. The cinematography was gray and cloudy, the editing incomprehensible, and the acting unsurprising and depressingly familiar. Simple, human emotions, which used to be integral to a movie are now so rare. Noise and all-too-familiar mayhem have been substituted.

Remains the pinnacle of the MCU,"The Marvel brand used to be the standard bearer. Today it's on the verge of needing a pallbearer. After a decade spent meticulously building a cohesive cinematic world, Disney released ""Avengers End Game"". It's a bit bloated, as you might expect for a story that had to tie together a nearly infinite number of plot and character threads, but it triumphantly sticks the landing on the so-called Infinity Saga and brings to a close one of cinema's grandest experiments.In the five years since ""End Game"", Disney has lost sight of what made their Marvel brand so successful in the first place. Sure, the over-saturation of the superhero/comic book genre hasn't helped. I get the sense that the genre, like the Roman Empire before it, is in its last days. But if Disney wants to recapture their momentum, they need to rediscover their purpose and return to what made the MCU great in the first place. And they need look no further than the first ""Avengers""Well written, expertly made and featuring excellent performances by all of the major actors, it remains the gold standard for the MCU, and the blueprint for how Disney can stop the rotting decay of their brand and return it to its former glory.Oh, and this goes for Star Wars, too.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
About time for a review,"So I realised that this movie came out 10 years ago, I was 5 and that really hit me. This was the first movie I saw in the cinemas and it changed my life. I remember sitting next to mum and dad, watching superheroes fight aliens! The thing I remember most is seeing the 360 shot of the Avengers in New York, brilliant! I love this movie and it will always hold a spot in my heart!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Hulk stole the show!! Excellent film!,"When I saw previews and commercials for this movie, I got really excited. I was a big fan of the old 70's Lou Ferrigno Incredible Hulk show. I loved Ang Lee's 2003 Hulk and the 2008 Hulk, so I knew Hulk would make a big impact on everyone who saw Avengers. Tony Stark was just flat out hilarious. 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger was not the greatest Marvel movie. I still liked Cap. America, but I just thought it was too in the 40's (kind of boring). I loved the Thor movie because there was great fun action in almost every scene (like the Avengers). The Avengers tops every Marvel movie I've ever seen and I can't wait for the September 25th Blu-ray/DVD release! I LOVE THE AVENGERS!! It might be hard for The Dark Knight Rises to top this film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Believe in Heroes in ""The Avengers""","Back on Earth through time and space, imperially arrogant god Loki (Tom Hiddleston) says, ""Freedom is the great lie"" Thor's half brother will make the world his new kingdom. The brave souls, who stand in his path, are The Avengers. Director and Writer Joss Whedon's ""The Avengers"" convincingly assembles solo superheroes and super egos to battle Loki and his alien minions in one of the year's best movies. Think of Whedon as Coach Phil Jackson, but for superheroes. Robert Downey Jr. as brash Tony Stark threatens Norse god Loki, ""If we can't protect the Earth, you can be damn sure we'll avenge it."" ""The Avengers"" is awesome.The classic hero story requires a commanding villain, and that is Tom Hiddleston as Loki. Hiddleston is charismatic evil and sympathetic sadness. He evokes certain pathos for Loki, feeling betrayed by his foil half brother Thor, strong and compassionate Chris Hemsworth. Thor fights with all his might against his brother, out of love and honor. Blond maned and shredded Hemsworth balances aloof charm and conviction as Thor. Whedon's ""The Avengers"" is timelessly inspiring: We believe in heroes who believe in themselves and others and would sacrifice their lives for the noble and just cause. I think the captivating leads of ""The Avengers"" are Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans. Downey Jr. brilliantly hides beneath Iron Man's Tony Stark's cynical narcissistic veneer, a caring man wiser than his smart ass punch lines. Evans is surprising. Aside from looking amazingly chiseled he embodies in Steve Rogers (Captain America) a self doubting relevance, while the inspired leader emerges. His Rogers is the frozen super soldier who awakens 70 years later into a new war.The cool Stark and the solid Rogers clash passionately. Stark mourns a fallen friend. Rogers asks if this is the first time he has lost a soldier. Stark screams, ""We are not soldiers!"" Whedon and Zak Pen's story is kinetically driven, with the foundation laid in character. Powerful egos and intentions must coalesce and foster value and respect—as some sort of functional family tasked with saving the world.Whedon generates amazing performances, and infuses welcome wit and humor. To that end, Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury, Director of the clandestine S.H.I.E.L.D., maybe the sinuous plot device. After making a career of cameos in previous Marvel superhero movies, Jackson fleshes out his bad ass Fury. He brings a refreshing gruff self awareness, after all The Avengers was his initiative so that these heroes would fight the fight we couldn't. However, is he the tough love patriot or calculated manipulator? Jackson cannily walks that fine line. Beautiful and idealist Cobie Smulders as loyal Agent Hill is Fury's social conscience. Stark, Rogers, and Dr. Banner (Mark Ruffalo) discern Fury's possible other motives shrouded in National Security.Exiled Loki brokers an alliance with the warrior alien race, the Chitauri. The Chitauri will let him rule Earth, if he brings them the Tesseract (Hyper Cube). The Tesseract harnesses the power of the galaxy, and is mysteriously tied to both Thor and Captain America. Loki uses the Tesseract to escape exile and breach S.H.I.E.L.D. Obtaining Tesseract, he brainwashes brave Agent Hawkeye (solid Jeremy Renner). Loki has a grand scheme. Expert straight man Clark Gregg as reliable Agent Coulson must call upon the team to protect the world. Scarlett Johansson is hot and deadly as Agent Natasha (Black Widow). She dispatches Russian mafia captors with Muay Thai and jujitsu in Jason Statham like style. She heads off to Calcutta to find Dr. Bruce Banner, and his raging green alter ego The Hulk. Ruffalo adds an understated brilliance and goofy charm that humanizes. We really believe that he has made his peace and controlled the ""other guy"". Coulson calls upon Stark (Downey Jr.), who is in the midst of clean power sourcing his Stark Tower. Stark has a playful relationship with his partner Pepper Potts (funny and beautiful Gwyneth Paltrow). Too bad Paltrow isn't leveraged more in ""The Avengers"".Of course assembling a bunch of super powered heroes is not immediate team building. Whedon orchestrates spectacular clashes amongst themselves. Thor, Iron Man, and Captain America battling in the dark forest is visually stunning. The Hulk taking on Thor is wild and strangely comical. The Hulk gets the prize for his cage match with evil Loki. The audience exploded in applause. Ruffalo is amazing. His casual nerd nicely bonds with Downey Jr.'s impatient genius. Renner as Hawkeye is solid and edgy, and plays nice. Johansson looks awesome in the black body suit. Even more impressive she shades the darkness and nobility of Natasha. She has a killer scene with Hiddleston at the story arc.""The Avengers"" delivers with the explosive visual spectacle as our heroes risk their lives battling the powerful aliens as they pulverize New York City. Whedon is masterful with the action and the characters. He makes us believe in heroes in ""The Avengers"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Simply Superb!,"The Avengers is simply a superb movie in every way that matters. Forget comparing it to other films of the genre. I'll save that for a later date because it really isn't important. Judging it as a stand alone piece of entertainment, it's the best time I've had in theaters in a very long time. First off, forget what you think you know or expect because it operates at a higher level then anyone would have guessed. There is very little clichéd about the film. They establish their own universe by themselves but it is so aided by all the previous solo lead in films. If you've seen them all, you're in for a real treat with Avengers. If you haven't, you'll enjoy them MORE now watching them after Avengers. They fearlessly take the adventure wire to wire but manage to make you really care about every circumstance, character and scene. Every character is believable given the nature of the universe they establish. You really are drawn in to the world and to the each and every character right from the first act. That connection makes the action more meaningful, just like with the best of movies regardless of genre. The dialog has been called superb by fans and critics alike for a reason. The conflict and tension present between EVERYONE (protagonist, antagonist, friend, and foe) absolutely makes the film. The performances that stem off of that are all remarkable. The charisma this film packs, and there's plenty of it, comes from the flawless performances and the dialog. Also, the supporting cast is utilized perfectly. This is as good and as fun of a film that has ever been made. Bold statement, I know. I rarely rely on critics but when nine out of ten of them praise this film they are doing so for a reason. It makes you wonder what those few others saw or how much they were paid not to like an instant classic.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An overrated movie,I have no idea how this movie is rated above 6.5..the movie actually has a hopelessly predictable plot..a good watch for kids maybe..the villain (loki) seems to have no idea what his course of action should be..his plan of taking over the earth is a hilarious one and no thought seems to have gone into it..how he survived is not clarified in the first place.. Thor also is also able to travel to earth despite the rainbow bridge being destroyed..there are too many anomalies which leave the viewer perplexed..the only good thing is the acting of Robert Downey Jr..the action is OK..but that is as good as it gets..only watch if you are an ardent fan of super heroes..,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
average,the avengers was an okay movie. I heard so much hype about the avengers and i didn't think it was amazing it was an okay film not really terrible and it wasn't amazing it was okay. The acting was okay but the effects were pretty good actually but because it was in 3d. I would say it deserves an acadamy award for best sound effects not best acting.every body is saying best film of the year you cant just say that right away the only film you can say the best film of the year is the Mario Puzos The Godfather. I liked the way that they put most of marvels Super Heros into one movie but only one villain.

Cant say i'm surprised...,"OK went into the cinema in April, ready to give this film a fair chance. Of course i knew what to expect and as usual, i wasn't disappointed. Not that that's good for the film. After watching it i then began to hear almost everybody say it was the best film in the world. Well that a Huge claim. Well TBH it doesn't have any of the qualities of ""Best film ever made"" in it. Story was at best flawed, some characters i would go as far to say as boring and the Special FX were just a cover up, blinding viewers from the truth, its not a great film. And then there's the villain. Weak.But it's not all bad, i thought it was funny and if your a fan of everything exploding then it is good for a quick thrill. Thought Nick Fury, Iron Man and Bruce Banner were good characters.I think the Kindest thing i can say about this movie is that it is Average. But like Avatar it is Hugely overrated, I'm afraid its another example of FX covering a mediocre story. Fun to watch but not the best film ever made.

"""You and I remember  Budapest very differently"" (dialog)","As a reviewer, I don't mess up often but, just like the line where Stark is ribbing Loki, sometimes even an IMDb top reviewer can have performance issues.My first view, I was annoyed that so much time was spent on backstory and it took an hour to get the ball rolling. Although in fairness once this story starts to move in the second hour, it MOVES.By my third viewing I could see the issue. I grew up with these characters and I had expectations. The expectations were incorrect, I now know, because those expectations were the reason the Marvel library was such a mess before the arrival of the Whedon Bros.So what Joss did was analyzed what was not working in past Marvel films then de-constructed the Avengers story, then build a film which could act as a base for future sequels, wit ha solid foundation.And wrote a script to die for. By the third time around I was actually listening to the film instead of just watching, and boy can that guy write.Like the line I posted as the title of this review. It took me 3 viewings to catch it. It is sly, it is sexual, and it is totally easy to overlook in all the action. But I was on the floor laughing.So there you go, it is fun, action packed (last hour), written at an Oscar level, the characters are perfectly cast (except the Nick Fury I grew up with was Caucasion, but I guess no one remembers) and, to keep the suits happy, not only made a bundle on its own but launched a new franchise.So that's a 10***********************************************ATT IMDb READERS IN THE BLIND -- ATT IMDb READERS IN THE BLINDJust watched this for the 8th time and want to update my review. As of this year (2017) this is, at the same time, one of the best ""action"" films in the history of the medium and one of the best scripts in the history of action films. I believe Joss received only one award for the screenplay, which is a pity, because it shows that the industry simply does not respect this genre. The little twists and turns that hold viewer attention like glue (""I'M ALWAYS ANGRY"" ""PUNY GOD"") are a Whedon trademark, and massively under-appreciated. I will also suggest that nothing with the Marvel brand that has arrived since Avengers I has been this good -- and I am including all their TV and other off-cable projects in that comment. The only flaw, and I mean the ONLY one, is that the close of this film sets an entire armada of ""politically correct"" followups having to do with the public blaming superheroes ... for being superheroes. Personally, as a superhero fan for over 60 years, I think that entire arc sucks and one day Marvel will figure that out. Otherwise perfect film!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Doesn't live up to the hype.,"I walked into The Avengers tonight expecting something fascinating, instead I was given a screwed up 1st and 2nd act, and a balls to the wall 3rd act.The Avengers was setting a really great tone of delving into a dark story of earth's take over by Loki and his army, and every time the film would go down this darker path, whether it be editing or poor script writing, as soon as it had you emotionally, and at the edge of your seat, a completely UN-needed joke or comedic moment was thrown in that totally destroyed the moment.This film easily could have had 20 minutes shaved off the run time, and no offense to JW fans, but he wasn't competent enough to direct this film. Had JF did this flick, I am sure the tone would have been much more in line with the Iron Man films, and of course the tone of the spin-offs (Thor, Capt. America) I will admit I was disappointed that Ed Norton didn't come back as Bruce Banner, but Mark Ruffalo made me forget about Ed within 3 minutes, but let us all be honest here, this was Robert Downey Jr's movie from the get go. The man is a great actor and he stole the entire film without even breaking a sweat. Others tried to keep up, but I think they were unprepared, and this can also be the fault of the director, it is his job to bring the performances out of the cast that are needed.What was really disappointing was the depth of character development, or I should say the poor execution of it. I know some folks will say, you have to see the other flicks and there you get your character development, but keep in mind, most audiences probably have not seen the other films and walked into this one with the hopes of learning what was needed to be known about everyone. Keep in mind not all of us are comic fans or superhero fans, and a film that is more or less a separate entry into the Marvel Universe, came off more like a sequel instead of an initial entry.As I noted the 3rd act was great. The war and battles were fantastic from start to finish. The cinematography and choreography for this sequence was top notch stuff, it is just a shame the amount of work that went into the third act wasn't put into the 1st and 2nd.Anyway, this is just my opinion on the flick. Did I hate it? No, not really. I gave it a 7 out of 10. I just felt it could have been better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Avengers Assemble,"I have not bothered to write a review about a movie for a while, but this one deserves it. After seeing a screening of the film at Madrid, I can say that The Avengers is The best superhero movie ever made (TM). One of the reasons that make me think like this is that I didn't love all the individual films of the characters.Captain America was right, Thor is average but entertaining and a with an awesome casting, the Hulk only was interesting when the big guy smashed, the second Iron Man was awful.This film exceeds by far the sum of its parts.It is bright, cheerful, colorful. A film by gentlemen in pajamas punching bad guys. Even the Black Widow, totally plain in Iron Man, has a great girl power Whedon style role. It is full of references to the readers, but I swear that every one has a twist that makes them even more fun.Of course, you have some script inconsistencies, and failure to apologize for cursing! Is a comic of gentlemen in pajamas, not The Regent! It has both humor grateful to see the original version and I have no doubt that the dubbing stamina.I wanted to applaud, to cheer... I wish you a experience like mine, with all the cinema enjoying. It is an experience that reminds us that sometimes, just sometimes, a film is much more than watching alone a movie surrounded by other people.Some might say that the Batman movies are better. I would say they are even different genres. Spiderman 2 is the only superhero movie that genuinely, in my humble opinion, can compete.Nobody here is going to win an Oscar, but that does not mean that it can not win a special place in your hearts.And the post-final after the credits ... Okay I expected it. But here we have our final wink, the ultimate gift for those who have spent years reading Marvel comics.

The viewpoint of an old classic movie fan who does not read comic books...,"... but is the ultimate fan of Joss Whedon.I came to this film with virtually no background in the Marvelverse, so I was a bit confused at first. My husband helped fill in the blanks by stopping the film when I had questions, but I have to admit the script did a good job of filling in the blanks minus a few details. This is an excellent film of its genre that incorporates everything special effects can do today with great character development, courtesy of Joss Whedon who wrote and directed this blockbuster masterpiece. Do you know how rare it is to have blockbuster and masterpiece in the same sentence? He has to know that at some level that he, once again, did the impossible. He took what could have easily been a disaster and he produced gold. He created a movie that was fun, and exciting and shaped and brought cohesion to the Marvel Movie Universe and gave each character their time to shine. It has great acting; quippy dialogue; tons of very well done action; and a decent, if underplayed, level of ambiguity to the morality of the characters. They worked individually, they worked collectively. It had lots of Ultimate Alliance moments. Hulk shoves a piece of armor into the giant worm and Thor hammers it into his head, Thor brings his hammer down on Cap's shield and causes a huge shockwave, Thor shoots lightning at Iron Man and causes his suit to boost up to like 400+% giving him a supercharged shot. I love that all of those moments were added. I also love how Joss had a bunch of the heroes fight each other in a way that made sense in the context of the movie. Thor vs Hulk, Thor vs Cap, Thor Vs Iron Man, Hawkeye vs Black Widow, Black Widow vs Hulk. You can't help but love each and every fight.Will people still be talking about it 80 years from now the way they talk about Citizen Kane? Probably not. But Whedon accomplished in the 2010's in making a film in which I was completely engrossed for two and a half hours, had a wonderful and fun time and wondered where the time had gone when the credits rolled.

Avengers disassemble...,"I love the Avengers, in theory. Unfortunately, in practice I couldn't wait for this movie to end.From the empty backstory for the 'bad guys', to a total lack of empathy for any of the main characters, I found this whole experience soul crushingly dull. Which is odd when there's an explosion or a fist fight every 5 minutes.It would be quite annoying to work out the veneer-thin plot if not having seen some of the prior Marvel outings for Thor, Iron Man, et al, but there are some saving graces.An almost seamless set of special effects does lend a sense of realism to the ridiculous scenarios that the heroes find themselves in. And with plenty of running time to allow each a fair chunk of screen time, it doesn't feel as if any one member is worth less than the rest.That's part of the problem for me- with trying to squeeze an equal share for everyone in, it starts to feel patched together, losing coherence. When the flow begins to break up, my attention span begins to shorten. I start to not care about the events or their impact on the story, and instead just want to see the Hulk smash.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A+ Easily my favorite movie of the year so far,"I loved The Avengers, it is easily my favorite movie of the year so far! It's the kind of movie that left us happy afterwards, that made us want to discuss it at length and made us leave reality; in every sense an aesthetic experience. I loved the action scenes, special effects, and all, but I suppose what I loved best about it were the hilarious one-liners that literally had the entire cinema laughing out loud. There were so many of these, too many to count with my fingers, in fact. There was also one moment when I actually cried, but then that was just me. I tend to cry over everything. *Sheepish smile.*I was initially afraid that so many characters in one movie would result in one convoluted mess, but the writers managed to make a script that somehow gave each character their own screen time without making it appear too contrived, or as though they just forcibly slotted a story in just so a certain character could appear. The entire story actually made sense and flowed naturally into one cohesive whole.I was also initially afraid that so many hunky heroes in one movie would make my heart or brain explode from confusion as to which one to 'ship, as I had fallen in love with each one of these heroes when I watched their individual films in the years past. (Okay, not all of them, just Iron Man, Thor and Captain America.) But here's what I realized - The Avengers makes for an interesting study in finding out what a girl truly finds attractive in a man, depending on who she loves most among the heroes. Is it Captain America, the handsome and wholesome boy next door with the hero's noble heart? Is it Thor, the fierce, masculine man with rippling muscles, facial hair and deep throaty growl? Is it the Hulk, the reserved brainiac with a surprisingly endearing shy smile? Or it it Iron Man, the witty genius billionaire playboy philanthropist (in his own words)?I am not going to recap the story, just go watch it yourself!

Spoiler-Free review of an Awesome flick!,"The movie touches on all bases that a good super-hero / fantasy movie should. A fantastic story line, solid action, good humor, and amazing visuals.The story is a bit much, kinda out-there (literally) but it is in keeping with the nature of the Thor / Asgard storyline. You cant include a Norse God without accepting some magik / fantasy elements. Plus the Avengers always tackled those issues in the books. Even the pacing was right on; at no point does it get slow or bogged down in exposition. Bottom line: it works.The action is solid on all levels, and some of it is just breathtaking. Even the face-offs are surprising, and fun to watch. Best action in a superhero movie period.The humor / emotion: the movie is hilarious without being stupid or directed at 8-year olds. Lucas / DC Comics take note! You don't have to make lame, childish jokes to be funny. Think more Joker with the pencil than anything in Green Lantern. Downey Jr is the driving force of this movie, and his Stark is turned up a notch. There a some literal laugh-out-loud moments in there, and some moments where the theater became deathly still. They pull strings without making you feel like a puppet.Finally, visually the movie looks amazing. ILM outdid themselves, and the one spot I'm sure everyone was worried about, the green one, just looks sick. Not a lot of shake-the-camera fake action, but some great scenes, even a few surprising choices of vantage points.The cast was perfect, Ruffalo IS Banner. A throwback to the Bixby days, instantly making you forget Norton or Bana. Evans owns the Cap / Leader / Good Guy role. You want to follow him. Johannson is a bad-ass in her role, Hemsworth is good, although Thor is kinda one-note. Hawkeye is an intriguing character, and Renner has the same great smirky tension he had in Hurt Locker. Agent Coulson has a much-expanded role in this, and his parts are special in themselves. And of course, Downey is king.Im not a huge Avengers fan, never was. X-Men or The Justice League were always my favorites, so I'm not total fanboy, but I think this movie captured every element a true comic fan would want to see on the screen, and casual fans can just enjoy it as well, because it stands alone as a great movie. Probably the best since First Class, maybe the best since Dark Knight. I know I walked out feeling like I did after Return Of The King. It's that good!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Perfectly Crafted Super Hero Movie,"So they all come together to fight a battle they cannot fight on their own. They don't exactly get along or have much appreciation for each other to begin with, but this is what makes this film work. This has been a long time lead up, starting back in 2008 with Iron Man and then ever so slightly linking each of these individual films together. It has been a hugely lucrative series for Marvel, sometimes good and other times not so good, it has all been leading to this point.For me, the picks out of these previous films are Iron Man and Thor, with The Hulk behind that and then right at the bottom, Captain America. Iron Man was fantastically fun with Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jnr.), the larger than life character who has it all. He is smart, witty, funny and extremely like able and loves what most boys do, his toys. With a great visionary director in Jon Favreau at the helm both the Iron Man films were extremely enjoyable. Thor, had a great cast in Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Anthony Hopkins and Tom Hiddleston. Kenneth Branagh really captured the fun and excitement of the story. The second attempt at The Hulk was quite good, but Norton, as much as I love him was not quite the right choice. The CGI Hulk was never really there yet and always felt very animated and never part of the furniture. Captain American, as a movie didn't work for me. There was not enough about him to keep me interested, not enough fun had. I love Chris Evans and thought he was the right choice, but with a fairly dull script and a much too serious approach, I was quite bored by the end.Now the question was always going to be, can they work as a group? With the much needed change of Bruce Bana to Mark Rufallo, and a few additional characters thrown in, the answer is a gigantic yes! Joss Wheddon does an amazing job of keeping a huge number of characters in tune. It is always the toughest element in story telling and here it really had a huge potential of being jumbled and disjointed. It is none of the above and on the contrary it is, in its entirety, exceptionally well balanced. The banter between the characters is priceless and gives the film a consistent flow and usually arises in what would normally be fairly dull background scenes. Everyone is extremely good, but the newcomer Mark Rufallo shines as Bruce Bana and 'the other guy'. The special effects for The Hulk are incredible and they have finally got him pretty much perfectly moulded into his surroundings. With the CGI sorted and the right actor behind the green monster, he seriously works and almost steels the show. Not quite, but he certainly steels any scenes he is in. Downey Jnr. as Stark is his usual witty, charming self and sets the banter off with great timing and finesse. Newcomers to the series in Black Widow played by the luscious Scarlett Johansson and Hawkeye played by the always solid Jeremy Renner are both commendable additions and both fit in marvelously. Tom Hiddleston as Loku, the villain of this story, plays his part impeccably well and deserves much praise and respect for this outing.The special effects are superb and the fight scenes are tremendous. Joss Whedon has definitely shown he is an avid comic book fan himself. He shows that he is not afraid to have fun with his material, and this really is the whole point. Where Chistopher Nolan has brilliantly turned Batman into a dark knight, Whedon constantly lightens the mood, which really is the only way this type of ensemble film could work. There is never a dull moment as the pace of the film is constant and this makes for a hugely entertaining film in ever way. This really is a perfectly made comic book adaptation.Smart, witty, funny, and hugely entertaining! This action packed joyride is brimming with different personalities, huge egos and awesome super powers. They work together perfectly in this marvel from Marvel!

Other Worlds,"From time to time, I have the gift of unique movie audiences. I've watched ""The Brady Bunch"" in an after school audience of teen and preteen LA girls. Down the road from where I live is the Pat Robertson school of film where most students believe they are in a fight with the devil and film is a most powerful tool for Jesus, and I can feel that in the response to certain films. My home theater is in the midst of a significant military area, so I sit next to warriors and their families when wondering about the war movies I see. This includes the so-called seal team six, and all the navy pilots in the mideast.But the most precious of shared dark space is when I am in Shanghai. I saw this film there, the only nonasian in the crowd — other than the 7 year old I was with. Then after a period of reflection, rewatched 'The Empire Strikes Back.'So I saw this film about the clash and merger of different worlds and dimensions while in full swim with that dynamic myself. (Chinese officials block access to IMDb, so this comment will be posted on my leaving.)The Star Wars films, the first of them anyway, demand only two extensions of the universe beyond a projection into the future. We assume that the future (or we did then) would include large machines, space travel and expanded notions of universal governance. There is no particular need to modify what we accept as the world we live in on that account. The notion of the force, and how it is woven into Jungian family dynamics was the big leap, the thing that forces us to stretch our universe. I think I understand the appeal of this across ages and cultures.The Marvel universe requires a different set of expansions. The time is now, yet we have world government and massive military machines and the same anachronistic limit on weapons. (There has been no advance in weapon technology: guns and swords.) We no longer need monsters to be designed to that actors can suit up, but even the CGI characters inherit this limit. But because they have to engage in hand-to-hand combat, we'll be asked only to assume beings more or less like us (but ugly) and big machines. They have the same notions of weapons (swords, guns, blasters) we have in both the real world and the cinematic sci-fi world.These limits ask little of us, but they limit the battles to be that same old crap we have seen hundreds of times before. The only thing Marvel could have brought was competence. Whelon does that.Where Marvel asks us to extend our universe is in the acceptance of complete, independent other worlds. These are not just different planets with the same physics, but different dimensions with (as much as the comic artists can imagine) different physics. This is a big assumption, and I suppose only a few enterprises (religious ones) can pull it off, because you have to take the space to define the different laws of the other dimensions.Marvel had a crew of different artists and writers, and they did not start out with a combined universe in mind, until a few managers until they combined several weak characters to sell more comics. (Stan Lee takes the credit for this, and I do not know the history well enough to dispute it.)So we have Tony Stark who really asks that we believe that the reach of technology will expand. We have several Marvel characters that also require only that we accept normal scientific accidents: radiation-based usually. The main disruptive device here is a crystal that asks only that we believe it emits some unknown radiation. This is only a cousin to the mysteries of the LHC. That takes care of Fury, Iron Man, Hulk and Captain America. Hawk and Widow are just spies with extraordinary training (along the lines of Batman).Thor, Loki, Asgard and the creatures from yet a third dimension are what expands this. We are asked to believe in an open, manyworld universe. Not other planets (as with Superman). Not humanmastered magic (Harry Potter, the Jedi, Dr Strange), but other worlds. I credit Lewis Carroll with making this possible.Having said that, what Whelon does is allow the character interplay to be a reflection (that is, folded) commentary on these assumptions. Everyone among the 8 or so members of the team looks at and questions the worlds of the other. This is where the Chinese context comes in. I suppose in the US, Captain America is seen as partly a joke, what we shorthand as only a ""cartoon,"" but here that distinction is lost -- especially as the actor is encouraged to take his role seriously. Here, what we have is Team America taken seriously.What is seen here — and the China market for Hollywood blockbusters is as large as the US market — is a dull-witted, good-hearted American soldier taking command. He is manipulated by the government and military leaders, and supplied with the most extraordinary technology. He even — and no one should be surprised by this — has access to the powers of the other worlds. The blond hair and Germanic manner really stand out here.Oh and the redheaded girl, with the spotty past, guile and commitment to do good.I have no idea what effect this will have on global audiences. The Marvel franchise is now as powerful as that of Star Wars and Potter, and much more able to be mapped to current events. Fury even references them. But I can tell you that this was a thrilling experience, to see this with the additional fold of the audience, some of whom looked away from me when leaving the theater.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
New York Geography,"To love movies is to enjoy good movies, no matter how you define them. If there are good movies, there are bad movies. While some people claim to hate CGI, there are those of us who consider it another tool to make a movie, but think it can be misused.I like a lot of superhero movies. I have been enjoying most of the Marvel Studio movies, but some are better than others. It turns out I like the big fight sequence in the first Avengers movie because it clearly takes place around Grand Central. I can relate to it, since I am a native New Yorker. I take pleasure in seeing how the Helmsley Palace tunnels are used, and the Pershing Overpass. The Spiderman movie with the elevated train along Canal Street annoyed me.There are lots of movies that use ""movie geography"" that makes no sense and they don't all use CGI. There was a Michael Keaton vehicle about twenty years ago called THE HARD WAY which annoyed me with its nonsensical geography. The problem is not CGI; It's using CGI or other techniques to enable bad scripts.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
About Time Marvel,"I've always loved Marvel films ever since the original Spider man back in 2002 Marvel to me was so much better then DC. Spider man was my favorite superhero and i thought he was awesome and couldn't be beat. But then Iron Man showed up 6 years later and at the end i found out it was just a thread for an Avengers film. Then with some other films in order we the fans have finally gotten what we deserve and that is the crown jewel called THE AVENGERS. This film defiantly deserves the award for most anticipated summer film, best superhero film and so on. If there is one flaw i had to give this film its that this film has an ending to it. Me I could watch Iron Man Thor Hulk etc fight evil a million times over and it would never get old because Stan the man Lee has created something special with each character in Marvel and those qualities have finally come out in this film",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A BRILLIANT SUPER HERO FANTASY THRILLER,PERFECT CAST.","Avengers Assemble is a big budget summer blockbuster that's action packed & perfectly cast, it's so Awesome to see these heroes we all grew up loving on screen together in a big adventure fantasy Thriller!!!Avengers has the right amount of seriousness & light humour, the action scenes are Awesome!!!
It's amazing seeing Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Iron man together fighting side by side & we also have the Awesome Hawkeye & Black Widow joining the fight.The cast is excellent, we have the legendary Samuel l Jackson as Nick Fury the guy who Assembles the Avengers when a threat against earth rises.
Chris Evans is perfect as Steve Rogers aka Captain America he's my favourite of the Avengers team & one of my favourite Marvel characters ever along with The Punisher & Daredevil.
Evans has the perfect balance of lost & weary old school soldier & also in control tough & confident leader when needed, he's a fantastic complex character.
The whole cast is perfect though, Thor is fun, tough & loyal & that's down to a great performance from Chris Hemsworth!!!
Robert Downey Jr is perfect as rich guy super hero Iron man, he's playful, funny & super smart it's a fantastic performance.
Mark Ruffalo is excellent as the big mighty incredible Hulk, another perfect performance bringing nice guy scientist Bruce Banner to life & the big green beast within.
The absolutely beautiful Scarlett Johansson is outstanding as extremely tough & super smart Black Widow, she's extremely Dangerous & extremely brave.
Also we have the excellent marksman Hawkeye played perfectly by Jeremy Renner who is probably my 2nd fave character after Captain America, Hawkeye is a Cool, tough & loyal warrior.
This first Avengers film is truly OUTSTANDING!!!

a ride of my life,"I don't usually write reviews and I am not an expert on analyzing all that cinematographic stuff or how god of a job director did. All I can say is that I had a time of my life. It was an amazing film with an amazing storyline and amazing actors in it. When I first heard about the avengers, I was very happy yet skeptical about it. My biggest concern was how they were going to put all these legendary characters into one film and provide them all with enough screen time to achieve some character development. Even after seeing it I have no idea how they did it, but they not only did it they smashed it. Right from the start I was taken to a ride of my life, I could not take my eyes out of what was going on. In terms of special effect, it was top-notch as it was expected no question about it. People are praising this film for being very witty and having a lot of comedy in it, I have to say I am not a fan of comedy, but this film made me laugh more than any other comedy in a very long time. Having to see Hulk smashing Loki or Capitan America patronizing Iron-man, or Iron-Man fighting Thor, was something you could have dreamt of to see on the big screen when you were a kid. But having a chance to see it done and developed in such an effective and spectacular fashion was beyond my wildest expectations, and trust me I had very high hopes for this film. Well, sorry for not being very structured and coherent about the whole thing, I just wanted to share a little bit of joy and excitement that I have been provided with watching this amazing film. It's an epic masterpiece, and seeing it on the big screen is a one of those things you have to do before you die, that's for sure.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

What's $200 million without a good story?,"What an utter disappointment. Expected so much more substance from Joss Whedon. With so many great characters w/ great stories, you'd think the writers could have put together a good story. But no--that's not what obscenely budgeted films with the sole purpose of setting up a franchise care most about. Everyone's already pointed out all the ridiculous plot problems, so I'll just say that the writers had NO excuse when there's an entire comic series worth of stories to supply all they needed to work things out. A waste of some decent actors and lots and lots of money. (Pretty clear that the only moment Samuel Jackson actually enjoyed was when he got to walk out and blow up one of the jets. He looked bored or in pain for every other mediocre line.) I enjoyed most of the witty one-liners...and that's about it.Shallow on so many levels...who cares how shiny the CG was or how many things got blown up? The studio may have raked in disgusting amounts of cash based on the hype (and the promise of a great story), but will anything else about this film be memorable? Can't see how Stan Lee would have been pleased...",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

IMDb ratings no longer reliable,"First of all, let me just establish the follow IMDb film ratings as a reference:A Clockwork Orange: 8.5 - Aliens (1986): 8.5 - American Beauty: 8.5 - Full Metal Jacket: 8.4 - Chinatown: 8.4 - Fargo: 8.2 - Donnie Darko: 8.1 - A Scanner Darkly: 7These are the kind of movies that get (and should get) 8+ ratings. They have real content. They're innovative, original, intelligent and thought-provoking. They're timeless classics.But the comparison may not be too fair, being such different genres. How does it REALLY stand up to Batman Begins (8.3), Watchmen (7.6), or any of the X-Men series, none of which reached and 8? These are all meant to fascinate and woe the same kind of target: comic-book fans, adrenaline-pumped teenagers and action-yearning males. Yet they are aeons away in terms of originality, depth, story and execution from 2012's The Avengers.I don't really have much of a gripe with ""The Avengers"" itself, as after seeing Captain America, I expected nothing more than another formulaic blockbuster. Even so, it's pretty bad even for a fill-in-the-villain/superhero/threat formula movie. A ridiculous super villain, flat characters, no excitement (as you know how things are going to turn out)My disappointment is mostly with IMDb. I'd trusted their rating in the past, but it seems as if that reliability is no longer. Either all the reviews are now being written by 10-year-olds, IMDb users are losing brain cells at an incredible pace, or something's pretty fishy.How many reviews that are titled things like ""Awesome! Blew my mind!"", or ""Coolest superhero movie ever!"", that you'd expect to be full of teenage adulation, grammatical mistakes and tons of slang, are actually very articulately written, displaying profound knowledge of script, direction, acting, and character analysis? I thought our education system was going down the drain! Where are all these lucid, eloquent, youths hiding out? And, being so instructed and discerning as they are, why the hell are they giving such a poorly made, mediocre movie such high scores?It looks like the industry's eye has finally set on IMDb's viewer-decanting power, and is corrupting it's authenticity beyond recognition. From now on, I guess I'll have to look elsewhere for real, trustworthy reviews.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A+ for Avengers,"With a simple plot, each character gets to shine (brilliantly) and despite all the previews there's still plenty of wit and action to keep you grinning from beginning to end. It's an incredible feat that Joss and all the team have pulled this movie off. There's one very minor little criticism, where two scenes noticeably seemed to cut off the characters heads. That said, I've just seen this film in 2D and I will be going again to see it in 3D. BRILLIANT!! p.s. I'm totally in love with the HULK..swoon!

Just WOW!!,"I have no idea how Joss Whedon has made this film work. Not only does this work, but this is one of the best superhero films I've ever seen. Surprisingly the script isn't as biased towards Iron Man as I thought it would be and every character gets a good amount of screen time and their chance to shine. Black Widow and Hawkeye more than hold their own and they aren't just in the background whilst the other superheroes dominate the screen and have all the action, Widow and Hawkeye do some unbelievably awesome things, and are crucial to the story. The dialogue is consistently witty and hilarious, every character gets to deliver a good punchline before the film is up. The final battle in Manhattan lasts a good half an hour at least, and I didn't want it to end, the action was of an epic scope and was absolutely jaw dropping. But the real surprise and best part of this film by far is the Hulk. After 2 so- so films they FINALLY got the Hulk right, and dare I say it, he's my favourite avenger after this, and this will probably be the case for most of you when you leave the theatre. This film was action packed, but it wasn't Transformers, this film had heart, intelligent dialogue and a cast of brilliant actors playing conflicting egos and colourful characters. Every actor is spot on in their respective roles, Tom Hiddleston makes for an excellent villain playing Loki, Thor's brother, and Robert Downey Jr. is much better here than he was in Iron Man 2. The only problem I really had with it was that in the middle it dragged on ever so slightly, but this was forgotten by the time the credits rolled. It has to be said though, if you haven't seen any of the Marvel films before this, you won't have any idea what's going on, and you probably won't really care for the film until the last hour or so kicks in.Make sure you stay through the end credits, it's not over just yet!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Avengers,"The Marvel's movie The Avengers is an action packed comedy sci-fi movie all in one. It has everything and everyone in it. All of the Marvel characters in one brought together by Nick Fury because Loki stole the Tesseract that was found in the Captain America movie. It has Thor, Hulk, Iron Man, Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Captain America. All the characters are extremely different, which made it very difficult for them to come together as one team against their other worldly foe, Loki. It takes the super heroes to get past their own egos and accept each other's help. It's difficult for the characters to come together because they're personalities are all so different, and they're also used to being the stars by themselves so that makes ten times more difficult to come together. There is a lot of inner conflict with the characters too. To start off with, the inevitable Iron Man. He is still the same Iron Man, a genius with a lot of money and a huge ego. Captain America just has came back from being frozen since the World War II times. He isn't used to all the technology that is used to really enhance the movie. That causes a conflict because Iron Man refers to Captain America as an ""old man"". Then there's Thor who is Loki's brother, there's more conflict. He comes to help because he is against his brothers antics. Loki believes that a world shouldn't have freedom like ours does. He comes to be the ruler and demands it. Then there's Natasha or the Black Widow, to me the typical woman in a super hero movie. She's almost seductive. They have her in tight clothing and she's manipulative. I am surprised that she can hold her own. I figured they would have made her more of a damsel in distress because she is the only woman in the movie really. Her friend Hawkeye becomes under Loki's spell trying to defend Loki from getting the Tesseract. He ends up having to fight Natasha and then comes out of the spell the help in the end. Then there's Hulk who has been trying to hide and stay away pretty much from people so he can keep calm. He hates becoming the Hulk, but when he does, he doesn't care who or what is in his way. He fights the other characters and tries to hurt them without really being aware.Disregarding all of the conflict the characters all come together in the end to take on Loki in the typical attack area I feel for a superhero movie, New York City. It has to happen in a big city to show the impact that it had on the movie. All around the quality of the movie is amazing. The way all the movies were tied together really worked. It was all around a great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The jokes were hilarious as well, the audience kept on laughing. This film is a solid 10/10. If you are skeptical about seeing the film, you shouldn't be. Every minute of it was mind-blowing.

Avengers - The start of an Era,"When we got to know that all of Marvels mightiest heroes would unite in this film it had a lot of expectations. The plot in itself is half decent. Quite predictable in some parts, but also had some intelligent bits. I found the acting of some characters a bit cliche, for example Chris Hemsworth and Samuel L Jackson. Tom Hiddleston has done well in the parts he could shine, but there wasn't much scope to his evilness. He just was evil. Not saying I would've wanted a background story on him, but would've liked some more dimension to his character. As always from Marvel, CGI and action scenes are done very professionally. I personally also liked the new film score for this movie.My rating is 6/10, because story was quite simple for the most part and some characters were a little too one dimensional.

A Great Example of Quality Movie-making,"""The Avengers"" is a great exercise in the art of fantasy movie-making. Its exemplary and superior production value, great performance by a stellar cast all portraying iconic superheroes, clever and witty dialogues (albeit with some nonchalant sarcasm thrown by RDJ as the charismatic and philanthropic billionaire with an obsession for high end technology and sophisticated gadgets), superb pacing nary a monotonous moment, adequate and sufficient background information for the uninitiated (those who haven't seen Thor, Captain America, The Incredible Hulk & The Iron Man franchise) but not overly cumbersome in its flashback of the introductory sequences, magnificent cinematography and mesmerizing VFX, profusely suitable background score without unnecessary cacophony and a brilliant, tight-knit plot giving each and every character enough time and screen presence to develop their respective characters, makes this as the best movie of 2012 by far without any hyperbole and on par with Batman:Dark Knight as possibly the greatest Superhero Movie, comprising of a heavy hitting ensemble cast delivering undoubtedly MARVEL's finest effort till date. Director Joss Whedon has done an exceptional and brilliant job. A must watch movie, which is surely going to be an Epic. It's an amazing movie full of heart, gravitas, emotion and depth.

Deserves praise for the special effects.. Not the story,"The Avengers is the first of it's kind, to have several movies as a build up. While some of the past movies starring the individual heroes, ranged from good to bad, The Avengers is supposed to be the climax of those movies. After seeing it, I was left a bit empty minded. Although I felt entertained throughout most of the movie, the lack of depth got to me several times. Don't get me wrong, it's not because the story is bad, as a matter of fact, it's better than most ""we-gotta-save-the-world"" stories involving superheroes. But where The Avengers fails, is when it comes to getting the audience out on the edge of their seats. You never really believe that they actually might fail, and it might be because this movie was aimed at an mainstream audience, that darker themes were left out. After superhero movies like Zack Snyder's ""Watchmen"" (which mixed, ideologies/politics with other deep themes) and Nolan's Batman franchise , The Avengers feels more like a well-made CGI orgy, with funny moments, amidst a story that fails to capture you. Although entertaining, don't expect to walk out of the theater, pondering about this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

It seems to be powered by some sort of electricity,"Loki attempts to enslave planet Earth.This is an entertaining movie with impressive spectacle and solid character moments.The plot for me is okay, as Loki and the Chitari never truly feel like a plausible threat. However, the character time it gives to various superheroes is exceptionally good.Putting so many comic book characters on the stage at the same time is a difficult concept, but this is done well with some excellent dialogue and creative uses of their powers in various situations. Some of the banter from characters like Black Widow, Iron Man, Loki and Captain America is wonderfully written and delivered.There are some fights that feel a bit forced to bring fanboys fantasies like Thor v Ironman or Thor v Hulk to life. However, they are admittedly fun to watch. What does get a bit much is the sheer volume of hyperkinetic CGI heavy action sequences. They are fantastically designed but for me there is too much of it. Personally I would have replaced some of this with quieter character moments but this is just a matter of taste.It goes without saying that all the visuals are high quality throughout the film. My favourite sequence is the Stuttgart scene, which is beautifully filmed, edited, scored and climaxes with some heroic posturing from the Avengers.When the Hulk goes o the rampage in the Helicarrier, there is a brilliant scene transition from him punching someone through a wall to a shot of Iron Man emerging from a similar shaped hole in a different wall.The climactic battle scene is a massive piece of spectacle and it includes some of the most impressive effects and CGI sequences in recent years. At the risk of sounding like a killjoy, some of the impressive feats of heroism performed by the Avengers do seem like they have been included for the sake of coolness, such as no look shots and other solo moves.'The Avengers' contains a number of solid performances. For me Scarlet Johansson has the most powerful screen presence and Mark Ruffalo makes a perfect Bruce Banner. Robert Downey Jr is as charismatic as ever, whilst Chris Evans, Chris Hemswoth, Samuel L Jackson and Jeremy Renner are all solid.

It gets everything right! What other movies will be measured to in the years that follow.,"Marvel's Avengers is everything a movie should be, and more. It goes without saying that it's the best film of the year to date. There's a serious subtext to the story and great characterization throughout but its focus is on the amazing. As an adventure film, it really has no parallel. When a movie reinvents a popular genre, it speaks volumes. This movie does just that and accomplishes what they've promised us since the first Iron Man movie... giving us that ""bigger universe"" in all its glory.The movie gets just about everything right but maybe its number one strength is the casting coupled with the writing. Meaning that every character has the perfect dialogue and every quality actor inhabits the hero they portray perfectly. Downey has Stark down cold but we knew that already. He's just given the right stage to shine here. Evans finds his pathos and his chops in this film as Steve Rogers. The Boy Scout all-American has an edge this time around. Hemsworth's Thor has understandable rationale for joining and doing what he does throughout the movie. His inner turmoil and guilt is exquisite. Tom Hiddleston certainly has the acting chops to hang with any movie villain EVER and he's perfect because this is no one dimensional character and his motivation and progression since the Thor film is seen and felt. Samuel L Jackson actually has something to do in this movie... PRAISE BE! Jeremy Renner is a nice addition and even with all the big guns chewing up every scene, he shines. Movie goers will want to see more of his character in the future guaranteed. Scarlett Johansson adds to the casting perfection. She's every bit the complex yet sexy female lead and a match for any male on screen. Would you expect any less from a Joss Whedon film? The interaction, conflict/turmoil and the relationships all work well and is definitely one of the highlights of the entire movie itself.Add some of the best kick-butt action sequences that I've ever seen and Avengers is what other movies will be measured to in the years that follow.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Thrilling and Satisfying Blockbuster,"So I recently watched ""The Avengers"" and let me tell you, it was lit. The action scenes were insane and the special effects were on point. But what really stood out to me was the chemistry between the characters, it was like they had been a team for years. I mean sure, As a huge fan, it was amazing to see them share the screen with all these other badass heroes. Overall, I highly recommend checking out ""The Avengers"" if you haven't already. Trust me, you won't regret it.The casting in Avengers is truly exceptional. Each actor effectively embodies their respective character, bringing them to life on screen. Chris Evans portraysals the role of Captain America with a sense of responsibility and gravitas, while Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Tony Stark/Iron Man is both charming and entertaining. Mark Ruffalo, who plays the Hulk, brings a level of vulnerability and empathy to the character that has never been seen before. Chris Hemsworth, as Thor, seamlessly blends power and humor, and Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow is fierce and formidable. But perhaps the stand-out performance is Tom Hiddleston as Loki, who imbues the villain with a charm and intelligence that commands the audience's attention throughout the film.The story of Avengers: Endgame is expertly crafted, weaving together a diverse array of characters and plotlines from the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a cohesive and impactful manner. The film is packed with unforgettable moments, from the grandiose action sequences to the more intimate, emotional moments. The climax of the film is truly a sight to behold, bringing all the characters together in a thrilling and satisfying conclusion.Overall, The Avengers is a must-see film. It is a marvel of filmmaking and storytelling, and it will be recognized as one of the best superhero films of all time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Avengers ∞ Synonyms to Iron Man 3 ∞,"The First question- Does 'The Avengers' is a film of six superheroes? Answer is NO. The movie is heavily based on the power and skills of IRON MAN and later followed by Hulk; all other characters are just supporting characters adding no extra flavor to remember. Since Captain America, Hawkeye & Natasha don't have super powers they lacked the status of being a superhero as far as avengers is concerned. Even the possibility of emotional connects between Clint Barton (Hawkeye) and Natasha was missing. Also Steve Rogers(Captain America) was struggling to make a presence with other super powers.If one has to term The Avengers as Ironman 3 than it would not be possibly wrong because from the beginning to the climax it's he who holds the film either by his action or style or the dialogues (some of them are really cool). The auto removal of his iron-suit by robotic machines was kool and in a scene where Loki pushed him from the heights, the way his Iron suit came, auto activated and became his body-suit was awesome. Thou Hulk was entertaining but he came into his 'Smashing Avatar' only after half the way movie has past. The way he beaten up the 'Loki' after his comments of being a God was really enjoyableBut Joss Whedon, the director could have done better to balance out the movie in terms of introducing equally capable superheroes. Also first half of the movie gradually reaches to boredom with the introduction of superheroes; it's only in the second half that excitement moved to the next level.When we talk about visual effects, cinematography, production value, 3D version or soundtrack all are good and worth praising. Regarding performances its again all the good humor punches goes along with Ironman which makes you smile followed by Hulk. Tom Hiddlestone as Loki and Scarlett Johansson as Natasha were impressive. Rest all were limited in role to mention.Overall it's a good weekend watch especially for Ironman and Hulk Fans but may not live up to the hype created. Walt Disney is gradually learning to tap South-Asian markets by pre releasing the movies here after the debacle of John Carter(thou a good movie) ;Hope this will worked out.Thanks & Regards AVA TheCritiqueLab.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I don't get the hype. Entertaining movie though !,"The amount of hype and praise this movie has gotten is out of hand. It's simply a blockbuster action-movie with superheroes. The plot is easy to follow; bad man wants to take over the Earth for some reason, gets help from aliens to do this, superheroes stop him/them. Of course, this is a bit general, and yes I know the names etc of all these people (beings?). Having had separate movies for many of these heroes (Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, The Incredible Hulk), we know these superheroes, their character and motives if you will. Not all the audience will have seen the previous movies, but it's not exactly a difficult story to follow, and we have seen the same plot 10000 times before, in different variations and in different mediums (books, comic-books, films etc).You guys could see the movie or read about the whole synopsis right here, because I can't bother telling it in detail. Anyway, point is this; if you want to see a summer, blockbuster action-movie with lots of eye candy, then you have discovered the right movie. It's fun, enjoyable and with lots of action, naturally. If you're looking for a great story though, you might have to look somewhere else. There's really no surprising twists or complexity, no fear for the well-being of any of the characters, and in short, not a really interesting story to tell.All the action-scenes are fun etc, but if an alien species invaded us, I would assume that they would have more potent weapons than some laser guns and huge fish-like robots that crash into buildings in Manhatten. Really, a demi-god like Loki and an advanced alien species are content with ravaging Manhatten a bit? Seems like we humans have better weapons alone in the atomic bomb, because one of those was enough to stop them. Yeah, and we have superheroes, three of which are severely underpowered and I don't understand why they were even there (Black Widow, Hawkeye and Captain America). Lame. Enjoyable and fun to watch, but bad story. Should get around 6-7 IMDb rating. Simply because it's a well-made action-movie blockbuster. No way this is among the best movies ever made, as it stands now in the IMDb ratings.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
About as Exciting as Watching 'Frosty The Snowman' for the Tenth Time!,"Storytelling as an art? What's that? And, who cares, anyway? When Hollywood makes tons of money off of bad movies, then where's the financial incentive to make decent films? 2012 is turning out to the worst year in decades (and I have been going to the movies for over 40 years, so that's saying something) for really bad blockbusters: first, Hunger Games; next,Dark Shadows; and now The Avengers!I am so sick and tired of New York City, specifically the island of Manhattan, being attacked in the movies. Hello! It was attacked in real life only a little over 10 years ago costing the lives of over 3,000+ real people, including my brother's co-worker, wife and unborn child! But what is really despicable is that at the very end of the The Avengers you briefly get to see a real-life news photo from 9/11 mourning the dead. That's just plain, disgusting exploitation!But lets not stop there! At the end of the film we get to briefly hear a local New York State Senator rant about how our Avenger heroes ""wrecked Manhattan."" That our heroes who just risked their lives in a 1,000+ ways are to ""blame"" for all the destruction! Fine! I agree many politicians are real jerks, but to put the letter ""D"" next to this Senator's name speaks volumes about the films real message: Democrats holding elective office are nothing more than ungrateful, winy creeps! That's real cute! I thought Hollywood was sooooooo liberal! If you going to interject politics into a film then why not put a ""R"" after the Senator's name? After all, the Republicans in Congress fought tooth and nail to prevent the establishment of a Federally funded medical fund for First Responders whose health was permanently impaired by breathing in all the toxic waste that was released into the air!The Avengers is also plain boring with the most two-dimensional characters in the history of film making! Sure I wanted the good guys to win! Sure the guys have cute muscles and the gals are all pretty! But, really now, who cares when there is zero character development and the storyline is about as exciting as watching Frosty The Snowman for the tenth time!The last third of the Avengers is nothing more than war porn! I will never watch another super hero movie that has a character from The Avengers as long as I live! Even for free, or if Hollywood offers me a million dollars! Overall, Hollywood has done a decent job with the X-men and the Fanatic Four, but for some reason the right-wing kooks who control the Avenger characters have turned them into nothing more than an exploitative moneymaking machine. No wonder why Stan Lee was so happy in his cameo appearance at the end of the film!

I love this movie!,"It is shocking to me that Loki's personal resentment against Thor led to all of this destruction. For what reason did he believe that he would just take control and dictate Earth without any consequences? Earth is not at an advantage in battle, so Nick Fury had the right of using the Tesseract to create weaponry. It took some time to get everyone on the same page, but in the end, their shared goal inspired them to work together as a team, which is why I admired how the Avengers came together. I have never watched the Marvel series before, but now I am totally invested.

"Excellent Writing, Dazzling Effects and Action, Fantastic Acting and Cast Chemistry","The Avengers features an ensemble cast of some of the biggest and best names in Hollywood, including Robert Downey Jr. As Iron Man, Chris Evans as Captain America, Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye just to name a few.The film's writing is excellent, it has a very well-structured and engaging storyline that effectively balances the different characters and subplots in a way many crossover superhero films lack. The film's humor is also noteworthy point for me, with Joss Whedon's signature wit on full display throughout. The action scenes are also visually stunning and exciting, with the special effects and CGI in particular being dazzling.The acting is also fantastic, with each actor bringing their A-game to their respective roles. The chemistry between the cast is magnificent, with the various characters bouncing off of each other in a way that is both entertaining and believable.Overall, in my opinion the Avengers is an excellent superhero film that is sure to enthral with its strong writing, excellent performances, and exciting action scenes.

It is a highly overrated film here in the IMDb, it is surely not top 250 material in any way, shape of form. I was disappointed when I saw the film, because it had a 8.7 score on IMDb at the time.

How can such a huge and dynamic film be so easily forgettable?,"""Marvel's The Avengers"" deserves full credit for it's dynamic execution in bringing the Marvel cast together, as it was a very well-structured and firmly put-together blockbuster by the exciting character-driven filmmaker, Joss Whedon. The clash and the interactions of each Marvel hero, and the development of this was exuberant, witty, and simply hilarious. As the film progressed into the action tone and the all-out, explosive warfare in New York City, the teamwork and building chemistry couldn't be anymore dynamic, and yet still humorous from Whedon's continuous comic relief of the combination of these contrasting superheroes. Although, after all this popcorn fun, simple but vital flaws remain.The score of this massively anticipated Marvel feature should've had a magical and intense sound similar to ""The Lord of the Rings"" or Christopher Nolan's Batman films. Instead the score failed to connect, as it lacked in ""pure epicness"" and beauty, and ultimately the film lost connection with one of the most important aspects in a film.Not only did the sound and score of the film not work, but the very simple story was exposed from the lack of depth in the telling of the story. This ultimately made the film feel smaller and weaker than it should be. With these small, yet very important, aspects of the film, frustratingly, not executed well, instead of ""Marvel's The Avengers"" ending on a high-note, it ends having zero connection with the story and characters, except Mark Ruffalo's brilliant interpretation of The Hulk, because the lack of connection from the score and the lack of depth in the storytelling ultimately wore on everything else that appeared on screen. What lack of connection in a film leads to is a forgettable movie because if a film doesn't connect and stick with someone, how can that film possibly be remembered. But it's ""Marvel's The Avengers,"" how can that be forgotten? Very easily. The concept won't be forgotten, nor will Joss Whedon's incredible character-portrayal of each superhero be forgotten, but it will be the anticipation and the potential brilliance in the other huge motion pictures in 2012 such as ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" and ""The Hobbit"" which will make ""The Avenger's"" be that film where everyone thinks, ""what was that movie that came out earlier this year, it was a huge movie...oh yeah, The Avengers how could I possibly forget that."" It's not because the film wasn't good, it was an awesome and intense blockbuster to watch, but it was the little things that left the film slightly over par.Simplifying it down, ""Marvel's The Avenger's"" was a fun film and one for everyone to see and really deserves high praise for it's execution of it's characters. Although, as glorious as it looked, it unfortunately did not sound nearly as good as I wanted it too. Yet, the film is still easily likable to any viewer because there is so much to like about in the excitement of this film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good, Not Great","After hearing my family rave about how incredible, awesome, amazing, blah, blah, blah ... this movie was, my wife and I went to see it. We are HUGE Marvel fans, and we were excited to see the movie. Our expectations simply were not met relative to all the hype, and this film is not worthy of an 8.6 rating. It's a very good movie, but not great by any means. Here's the good and the bad.The Good: The special effects were outstanding as you would expect. The acting was also nicely done. The script was somewhat well paced, although we both felt it started fairly slowly. The movie did had some of the funniest moments of any super hero film I've seen. The storyline was OK, but that brings me to the bad.The Bad: The storyline was just OK. I won't spoil the movie, but suffice it to say the anti-heroes motivations were somewhat silly to me. That said, it follows (somewhat) to the comic storyline, so the plot was never really all that interesting to begin with. The actors and directors did the best they could with the plot, but I was never pulled into the story that deeply, nor did it strike any emotional connection or interest for me. It was just a great action movie that was well acted with a reasonable script.Avengers is a very good action film, and worthy of seeing on the big screen.

Even five of the world's most powerful superheroes could't save this movie!,"Did not live up to my expectations AT ALL. For a movie with such hype, it was very long and the picture was very dark. Too many overly dramatic lines, and the buildup music lasted for practically the whole movie. I usually love superhero movies, but this one was a letdown. I don't know why it got such great ratings. The Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, and Captain America movies were more enjoyable on their own. I thought it would be great to see all these heroes come together, but I think it really just lead to so many main characters that the audience didn't get a chance to understand any of them individually. Special effects were great, don't get me wrong, and the 3D was cool, but that wasn't enough to save the movie. Storyline was too stretched out. Underwhelming opening. The movie didn't evoke my emotions (I wasn't scared, sad, excited, relieved when I should have been).

The first phase of the MCU concludes with an ambitious and unprecedented crossover event that tells a satisfying story balancing multiple established characters.,"At a S. H. I. E. L. D. facility researching the power source known as the Tesseract, Director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) oversees the research being conducted by Erik Selvig (Steelan Skarsgard) with the Tesseract seeing some unusual activity. Eventually the Tesseract brings forth Loki (Tom Hiddleston) who has acquired a staff that gives him substantial power and uses it to steal the Tesseract and take control of Selvig and S. H. I. E. L. D. agent Clint Barton aka Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). In response to the threat posed Fury sends agent Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) to recruit Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) due to his expertise in Gamma Radiation being necessary in tracking the Tesseract and also brings in Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and the recently revived Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) to assist in a battle which also sees the return of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) who comes to stop his brother Loki.The Avengers is a 2012 superhero film and the concluding chapter to the first phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The amount of buildup leading into the Avengers was nothing short of astounding only made even more so when you consider the hurdles this series went through to get to this point. While the MCU had been planned in advance, unlike the comic books it was based upon which had to rely on coordinating the artists, writers, and editors, the films had all that in addition to budgets, casts, and general feasibility with the noted departure of Edward Norton as Bruce Banner following disagreements over 2008's The Incredible Hulk which ended up being downplayed in terms of its significance to the overall universe, and uncertainty that Scarlet Johansson would even return as Black Widow with a back-up script featuring the inclusion of The Wasp briefly considered. However following re-writes by director Joss Whedon that elaborated on Zak Penn's original script, the script and cast was set including a soft relaunch of the Hulk character with Mark Ruffalo stepping in for Norton. Upon release the film garnered the best receives of the series since the original Iron Man and became a massive hit too with a $200 million opening weekend in the United States that carried it to $600 million domestically and $1.5 million worldwide that most likely gave Paramount massive sellers remorse for only taking a little over $100 million for distribution of Avengers and Iron Man 3....whoops. All these years later now free of the buildup and hype that propelled it to blockbuster status, does The Avengers still hold up? In short, yes it does.The movie does a good job of including and paying off all the characters and plot threads established over the previous films with every character getting their chance to shine even seemingly minor characters like Hawkeye and Black Widow who didn't get to do much in their debuts in Thor and Iron Man 2 respectively, but do feel like they're allowed to make more of an impression this time around and get some solid standout moments despite being alongside their powered colleagues. Robert Downey Jr. Is really good as Tony Stark, Chris Hemsworth remains good as Thor, and Chris Evans is still as effortlessly likable as Captain America and his traditional values where he fought more overtly evil antagonists are contrasted well against a world with more shades of grey to it and is probably one of the reasons why Captain America's movies tended to be the best in this franchise. The movie also gives some great moments to its supporting cast including Clark Gregg's welcome return as Agent Coulson, Jeremy Renner and Scarlet Johansson get some fun moments as Hawkeye and Black Widow, and Mark Ruffalo gets a fantastic introduction as Bruce Banner/Hulk with some solid pathos from the character as well as some genuinely amusing humorous moments especially in the climax. Loki is also a solid antagonist who is wonderfully despicable embracing his ""trickster"" persona as someone who has considered every possible angle and wants his adversaries to know it. There is the occasional gaffe in storytelling such as with Loki's ""partners"" purposefully kept off screen for the sake of laying groundwork for more sequels and I wasn't quite sure how Thor found out about the Chitahuri (or even their name for that matter) but these are minor nitpicks in a movie that delivers everywhere it should.The Avengers is the gold standard for modern ""cinematic universes"" and many have tried to copy its formula to only modest success if at all (I'm sure we all remember the Dark Universe...oh wait, no we don't). The Avengers does a good job of balancing many moving parts and characters and feels like a well worth it pay off to the films that preceded it while also laying the groundwork for what's to come.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Wow,"Finally the Marvel Franchise reveals it's coup de grace and it's everything that we hoped for. Before I totally kiss this movie's butt for a while I'm going to delve into the negatives first.Just a warning the first 25 minutes are a little slow, which is to be expected when telling such a large story. Lord of the Rings needed a whole movie to build up to the adventure to put it into context. Some of Loki's dialogue is a little hard to understand at times because of the Norse language dialect, but that's easily fixed with second viewings. Other than that and some nitpicks the movie delivers.This is the movie we all made playing with our toys as a kid. Wheedon has done a fantastic job and I really don't think this movie could've worked as well without him. All the characters fit in this movie. I never thought a conversation between Loki and Nick Fury would work on screen but it does. Every character gets to shine in this movie. At time it's a Black Widow movie, then an Ironman movie, then a Thor movie, then a Captain America movie it all just fits perfectly. This movie has the best editing I've seen all year and some of the best acting to go with it. This movie is a culmination of several geek movies in one. It's got the ear turning and self reflection of Scott Pilgrim with the ensemble aspect of Star Trek (2009) with great dialogue.I'm going to say character a lot because that's the focus. The story is a little weak because it comes second to the characters. I've always described superhero movies are character pieces with big budgets. A lot of people complained that it's a comedy or that it's just a loud mindless movie with explosions like Transformers. Since when does having great humor make something a comedy? All the humor is in the witty dialogue and a few physical gags which are hilarious and also unique to the characters. And Wheedon adds lots of little subtle setups to the ending to make the movie more cohesive and smarter than it is. It's not a bad story it's just a simple character driven one. The only superhero movie I know that has more emphasis on story is The Dark Knight, but this blows that out of the water. 6 heroes are better than one. That's why Lord of The Rings, Star Trek, and Toy Story are so great. The Team or The Ensemble.There are so many ways this movie could've been ruined. Maybe they got the writing right, and the action is choreographed well but is filmed with shaky cam or is incoherent. All the action scenes in this movie are great and easy on the eyes and even have lots of character in them. The best scene in this movie is when the avengers are all arguing in a room. And the acting is the greatest. I still have a hard time wrestling with who was my favorite actor in this. This movie is so much fun and if you don't like it it's probably because you didn't want to so anybody with an open mind should love this 10 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Unbelievably over-hyped!,"I don't believe anyone wouldn't enjoy it and so I would recommend it, but at the same time, I felt the urge to write a cautionary review to try and add to the expulsion of some of the 9/10 star hype (and the ridiculous 1 star reviews).I felt a little tired the night I went to watch this film, but since I'd booked tickets I went anyway. I think this might be why I came out feeling it wasn't awe-inspiring. My tiredness stopped me from enjoying the non-stop 'conceptual interfaces', the flash and the CGI, when you are less aware of these aspects what is underneath is not as high-concept as is made out. What I found was a slightly bumbling first half and an action-packed second half. I believe if you got this home when it comes out and watch it on an average TV on DVD you wouldn't be as impressed.With so many stories to include there isn't much exploration of any particular area, we have a fair bit of time dedicated to learning a little about each character but given it does nothing more than glance across the surface, why bother at all? Why not give us more in-depth insight into the 'mechanics' of the how and why, a creative discussion on, well, something - anything and let the audience infer the rest by showing us in character reactions etc. Then let the second half let-rip.I'm no film buff but it seems to me that when you stop and actually compare films of IMDb's claim to be equal in calibre - we have The Avengers being better than Taxi Driver, Alien and only 0.2 behind Empire Strikes Back - obviously you can't really compare the films because they're so different but it's a point about the ratings.In the characters we see half interesting and half one-dimensional, with a strange amount of time, relatively speaking, being given to aspects that don't really push the film forward. Sorry for the lack of pro-critique - like I said, I'm not a film buff.I didn't know this was a Joss Whedon film until after I watched it and this makes sense - a lot of his stuff is amazing and deep, subtle and telling, yet then you get other work like Dollhouse which falls down by picking the wrong kind of area to focus on.It's worth a watch though, and if you like comic book films like Iron Man (obviously) you're going to enjoy this. For those less interested in that stuff, don't expect 9 or 10 stars.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Bad?...NO! Disappointed? YES!,"Even with the action packed fighting scenes of numerous superheroes and very clever humor, The Avengers fails to live up to its expectations as being the best superhero movie ever made.Basically, the only people who were acting in the movie were; Captain America, Nick Fury & Black Widow, the rest were there just to fight. Even if that was the soul purpose of the movie, not a lot of work was put into the performance of the main characters, except for the ones mentioned above.Still don't know why Captain America and Hawkeye were casted in the movie, they have no soul importance. Yes, Captain America is inspiring but Marvel could've surely gone with ANYONE else. Maybe wait another year and let the reboot of Spiderman release and cast Spiderman in The Avengers. The only thing that exceed's expectation is the Hulk with its awesome power and dominance (even that was kept very late)There weren't any jaw-dropping action scenes but there were some great laughs when the heroes fought or argued with each other.All in all, it can be called a disappointment, because I really don't think this movie is better than Spiderman or Spiderman 2 or Batman Begins or The Dark Knight or Iron Man or The Incredible Hulk or even Thor. In my opinion, this not the best Marvel movie ever made, the reason to which I think could be that, it was done very hurriedly.

Charlie Chaplin meets Lucy meets Jules,"The 21st century has seen more superhero movies than I can count. This year alone has already seen ""Black Panther"". I won't deny that Stan Lee created a diverse variety of do-gooders in the Marvel Universe. ""The Avengers"" (not to be confused with the 1960s TV series) is entertaining enough. It's nothing special - much of it is sensory overload - but it's nothing that it doesn't pretend to be. Loki is the common suave but malevolent villain. He could trick anyone into thinking that he's a decent person. This movie will definitely please the Leonard Hofstadters, Sheldon Coopers, Howard Wolowitzes and Raj Koothrapalis of the world.It was a pleasant surprise to see that one of the people in the World Security Council got played by Jenny Agutter (the nurse in ""An American Werewolf in London"").

The actors were all on point and did a great job, I did miss Edward Norton in the film but mark ruffalo definitely won me over and was very pleased with his work in this film. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a action packed film full of drama and chaos! Robert Downey Jr. Is probably my favorite actor and if not he's very high on my list but the commitment and work put in from the entire crew of production and filming members is one for the books. I'm really looking toward to seeing a second part to this movie and I'm very confident when I say that I know it will be great! If you know anything about any of these comic book heroes then I'm sure you didn't need to see any movies such as the Iron Man trilogy, Thor, Captain America, or the Hulk to understand this film... But having seen all of those leading up to the avengers is what made this movie incredible, the investment and work put in by everyone just amazes me.

The Acting was outstanding and the effects are on the mark and I'm a stickler for special effects.Best Action movie so far this year, and it will be hard to top. Well worth the outrageous prices they have to charge at the theaters for popcorn and soft drinks (I took my nephew with me, he loves His Hulk with some popcorn and a pop). Joss Whedon did an excellent job especially with some of the more unusual camera angles. The playing off of Thor's GF was smart but might have made for another interesting side love like Tony Stark had with Pepper.

Best Superhero Movie Ever,"There are absolutely no words to describe the full percentage of enjoyment I received from this movie. The Avengers is phenomenal.

To call this film an utter triumph would be a gross under-exaggeration. Containing some of the best action sequences ever captured on film, the wittiest and most hilarious humor I have seen, and probably the greatest chemistry between both characters and actors in cinema.

Who am I to hate this mega franchise? I thought iron man, hulk and Thor were great. Captain America not so great but nevermind. I took my wife to watch it and she hates these kind of flicks. We were about half way through and I asked her ""Do you want to stay or shall we go?"". I cannot remember a time when I have ever asked her such a question, not even for crappy flick. At the end I asked her what she thought? she loved it! I was bemused - I actually got bored. Now don't get me wrong, I love movies.

Big Loud Messy Entertainment,"The Avengers was very well waited among Marvel comic book fans and general superhero fans. When it comes to delving deeply into the minds or motivations of the film's other, previously established heroes, he abstains all together. And maybe that's for the best. Even with 2 hours and 24 minutes to kill, there's precious little time for him to offer remedial courses in Marvel mythology. Those who haven't done their homework and watched the previous films still should be able to follow the basics, but they almost certainly will be left scratching their heads from time to time.In the mix among stars doing battle are Scarlett Johansson, who plays the Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner as archery expert Hawkeye. There were a lot of high expectations for this film and on many levels it delivers, while on few others it disappoints. Since writer-director Joss Whedon was dealing with so many big-name stars, like Robert Downey Jr., who reprises his role as Iron Man, Gwenyth Paltrow as Pepper Potts and Mark Ruffalo, who takes over the role of Dr. Bruce Banner a.k.a. the Hulk, there's just not enough screen time to fit everyone adequately in.For those who have kept up with it, though, The Avengers is a nice payoff to a sprawling and ambitious filmmaking strategy, and one whose blueprint can be counted on to change the way major studios approach their superhero franchises for years to come.

As a rewatch 05/01/18' and nearly 5 years since initial watch 12/10/13' opinions remain near same.

Perfect in every way,"Everything just worked perfectly for The Avengers. My geek heart jumped several times during the movie. So many cool and memorable action scenes, great comic timing, It is just epic in every way. The overall story is simple (evil guy wants to dominate earth), but it doesn't matter because it still carries depth due to the previous movies which are tied together seamlessly with this one. The chemistry between the actors are perfect, and skeptics don't worry, Caps suit is not bad looking at all and there is a perfectly fine explanation for why it does not look as high tech shiny as the rest of The Avengers, but for that one, you need to watch the movie. Experiences like this is why cinema is still the best place to watch epic action movies, and The Avengers is nothing but EPIC!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
1000 words isn't long enough!,"Speaking as a fan of Iron Man and the rash of other constituent superhero films in the last few years AND a fan of The Avengers AND as a fan of Joss Whedon I can say that I was really pumped to see this film. Add to that the early reviews calling this film the greatest Superhero film of all time and I was ready to go.Having seen it with a VERY participatory audience on Friday night I was blown away, Joss Whedon delivered on all the promises that had been made. But the BEST superhero film of all time? Really?Well, I still think Watchmen deserve that particular honor. Realizing that I might have offended, well... everybody with that comment it must be said that there a couple of qualifiers here.I think as a FILM discrete from any other films or comics (thus cutting out the graphic novel in Watchmen's case as well as the mountain of literature involving the Avengers and it's many characters) Watchmen takes it, its structure and tone are more adult oriented which lowered the box office figures and since the best cut of that movie is the director's cut that hurt it too, but I believe it is a better film.Having said that and having gotten it out of the way I now proceed to what The Avengers brings to the table that makes this film MORE FUN than Watchmen. We add back in all the connections to movies and comics and POW, you have a mythos that everyone is aware of and has been awaiting for four years or more and The Avengers wins hands down just for its cultural impact. Everyone may not know who Doctor Manhattan is, but if you are reading this (or are breathing) you probably have heard of the Incredible Hulk or Iron Man.One of the things I like about the Marvel universe is that the heroes in its world FIGHT EACH other. This is one of the reasons I was attracted to WatchmenThe Avengers themselves are directed to glory by Joss Whedon who had the overwhelming task of first making these guys fight each other and then come together as a team. This problem alone would have made most directors run away and hide under the bed but he does it. He is helped by the fact that he did not have to tell ONE SINGLE origin story, this had all been taken care of in the earlier movies. This also creates the disadvantage that the characters have to now meet each other and not bore the audience with redundancies. Not only that he does it without making the characters look silly or rather, more accurately, makes it so the silliness of a hammer throwing Norse god coming to blows with a soldier from World War II dressed in an American flag is not an obstacle but becomes the path to common ground.The job of getting these guys to work together in the film falls to Nick Fury, played by an irreverent Samuel L. Jackson. One aspect of Fury's character is that being a spy/soldier this guy can look into his superior's faces and say ""I understand you made a decision, but since it was a stupid ass decision I decided to ignore it"". It is not hard to figure out why Nick Fury would be the one to be the one to conceive of the Avengers Initiative in the first place.The group he gathers to save the Earth consists of an egomaniac, a megalomaniac Norse god, an old time American soldier with testosterone in abundance, a very hot girl who can get information out of anyone (and, it must be said should get her butt its own show) and last and certainly not least a guy who has ""breathtaking anger management issues.The actors also step up to the job as well and since my memory for actors' names is rather sketchy you'll forgive me for taking the quick route. Robert Downey Jr. is the same Iron man he's always been. The Hulk... well I'll save him for last. Thor manages to deliver one of the funniest lines in the film while simultaneously causing my wife to form a puddle of drool in her lap (the guy is FREAKING GOOD LOOKIN' what can I say?) which is okay because I was lovin' Scarlett what'sherface's Butt. Captain America makes up for the deficiencies of his origin movie by playing his role with a mixture of frustration at his circumstances and the loyalty of a soldier. There is also a star turn from Clark Gregg who acts in a redshirt capacity. Then there is Samuel L. Jackson who just has to stand there and look cool.Now for the Hulk, I got excited originally because I am a fan of Edward Norton. I watched that movie because I was a fan of Edward Norton and when Avengers time came I expected Edward Norton to be there to round out a perfect cast. Instead I was informed that someone named Mark Ruffalo was taking his place. Now, while he did extremely well, I was waiting to see Edward Norton and Robert Downy Jr. play off each other, I think if there is one severe disappointment in the acting it is this one.I began writing this review because fans, in the ebullience of the opening weekend, called this the best superhero film ever. I disagreed, here's how it breaks down.Pure movie making (strictly movie to movie) goes to Watchmen Storytelling goes to Watchmen Beauty goes to Watchmen Mass appeal goes to the Avengers Pure fun goes to the Avengers Intellectual Satisfaction goes to Watchmen Action goes to the Avengers Character is a tie Pure satisfaction upon finishing the movie goes to the Avengers.I think the Avengers wins.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
better story than expected,"I was fully expecting to not like this movie because I haven't thought much of Iron Man or Captain America movies, but the story behind this film was better than I expected. Also, you need to have seen previous superhero movies to get this movie, especially Thor. Loki, Thor's evil brother, comes to earth to lead an alien invasion and it's up to the superheros to stop him. The Black Widow and Hawkeye have very little to do and could have been left out. So basically, the heroes are chasing Loki around until the invasion when there is a huge battle at the end. The battle was cool with cool computer effects. This is when the Hulk gets to play his big part. But the main heroes in the film were Thor and Ironman, and Captain America gets to make a few decisions too.FINAL VERDICT: OK action flick, but you need to know about the previous superhero movies to get this one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The Avengers Realistic grown-up review®: Nice, but meh","Reading the other reviews, it seems everyone is quite excited about this movie. Let me start by saying that yes, it's awesome to look at, it's cool to have all those characters together on screen, and the movie definitely doesn't lack action.The reason I'm not giving 8+ stars is the story – or lack thereof. Considering that Joss Whedon wrote this, I have to say I'm quite disappointed by the result. The movie was predictable right from the start, and in spite of the abundance of action-sequences, failed to really catch my attention.I'm not saying this is a waste of time, but considering the majority of reviews here on IMDb, I just wanted to add my grain of salt for those pondering what to watch this evening.

It is as good a superhero movie as there can be,"Avengers is one hell of an action movie.

A MUST see!,"You can think I'm jumping on the bandwagon or whatever you want - this movie was AMAZING. I would give it a 10 out of 10 if Cobie Smulders hadn't been so poorly miscast. Go back to Ted, Robin, you don't belong here. I would be hard pressed to find anything else wrong with this movie.The best scenes are not when the Avengers are working together to fight the enemy, it's when they're fighting each other - with words (hilarious!) or with weapons (bad***!). Some might say the beginning of this movie starts out too slow and there isn't enough action - I'd say they are dead wrong. Dead wrong. This is a movie that doesn't insult the audience by assuming that all they want are things to go crash and boom. This is a movie that cares about developing their characters and cares about an actual storyline. Sure, they're all superheros, but they're all also human. Don't worry though, there's still plenty of action to go around and each of the characters in this movie pulls his (and her!) own weight.My only piece of advice is to first see Captain America, Iron Man (at least the first), and Thor. Especially Thor since the entire premise of this movie is based on Thor's brother Loki - Tom Hiddleston is RIDICULOUSLY amazing in this movie. Avengers does a good job of catching you up to speed if you haven't seen these other movies (or read the comic books, which I admittedly haven't) but I would still recommend seeing them.Bottom Line: If I had the money, I'd be paying to see this movie in the theater every day.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Whedon's explosive comic-com' smashes the bullseye...,"Consider the wit, brawn and pulse-pounding balls of both Iron Man movies and the spectacular Thor. Now consider the flaws and failings of Captain America, Fury and two incredibly average Hulk flicks. What are you left with? A question: where exactly was in-form writer/director Joss Whedon's Avengers Assemble actually going to go? Down the pan? Or through the roof? Well, guess what? He's only gone and pulled it off.Ever since that teasing Nick Fury advent at the end of the first Iron Man, fans and filmgoers alike have been seeing-out the end credits of all subsequent Marvel flicks in hope of something (anything). What they got was everything. All signs pointed to an assemble, all roads lead to an Avengers movie. 5 years in the making? Try 50 for any Marvel mogul worth their salt will tell you a film's been coming since the early 1960's.And here it is: 4 big-buck franchises rolled into one: Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and Hulk. Robert Downey-Junior, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans and...Mark Ruffolo?! Ed Norton obviously didn't fancy this one but fear not, Hulk nuts, Ruffolo's twitchy turn makes for the best Banner yet. Anyway, throw these four in a room together and you're guaranteed two things; friction and fun. Our heroes square up, square off but in the end...well you can guess where it goes. The story? SHIELD head Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) enlists the fickle four along with Black Widow (Scarlet Johanson) to help save the world from Thor's bad brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Zero points for innovation, then. But if you thought Tony Stark suiting-up for the first-time was the coolest thing you've ever seen. Think again.Skilled sci-fi pen-cum-director Joss Whedon has well and truly arrived with this dizzyingly brilliant blockbuster that's more than the sum of it's fluctuating parts. Believe the hype, Avengers Assemble is a cast-iron hit. It's incredible. It's thunderous. It's furious, beaming, biting and marvellous. But enough puns, let's get down to business.Whedon has approached this four-way fusion in the right way: a strong and balanced emphasis on plot, dialogue and visuals, character development and chemistry. Too many cooks? Hell no. The big-name players work so well with one another it's actually surprising. The sheer sum and sense of one-liners and put-downs are just as memorable as the brutal, in-house beat-downs. Which is saying something when you consider scenes pitting Iron Man and Hulk against Thor are enough to send an entire generation of comic-book geeks into cardiac arrest.Downey-Junior's effortlessly cool turn on the sarci' Stark was always going to be the main lure, here, but to say he outshines his peers would be wrong. It's not all about the billionaire ball-buster. Everyone gets their 15 minutes. Both Hemsworth and Ruffolo (in particular) are bang on. Even the out-of-touch Cap' chips in with a few big, cheesy shots and Hiddleston's creepy demigod makes for a sharp villain.Granted, Whedon's tongue-in-cheek ethos and slapstick-like approach means the Avengers was never going to measure up to any of Nolan's Batman films. How many comic-book films (or films, in general) do!? Which is why there's not much point even trying to compare this breath-snatching Marvel muster to Nolan's Dark Knight rebirth. It's a kick-ass popcorn movie for young and old. Nothing more.That said, this hulking 142 minute feature is a stimulating affair with a freehold on the brash and the flash and the down-right hilarious. It's an absolute blast. Wildly entertaining, ridiculously awesome, the Avengers' is everything it should be: over-the-top, funny, cool, funny, loud, exciting, electric and did I mention funny!?Best comic book movie ever? No. Best Marvel production ever? Yeeeeee...no. X-Men: First Class still has that one tied-up but for such a question to prompt a pause for thought says an awful lot. Whedon's Assemble may not be the best superhero film out there but it is the funniest and probably the most entertaining. Definitely the coolest.Sure, there may be a limit to how many times you can watch superheroes kick the crap out of one and all. But you won't mind too much. Popcorn cinema doesn't get much better than this. Joss Whedon and co. have kicked this year's comic-book-busters off with a bang. Expect sequels.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"It's an unlikely movie, but they pulled it off","Tying all of the various Marvel movie threads together is a tall order, and ""The Avengers"" does a pretty fine job of that. Chief among the movie's strengths is that everyone who headlined their own movies gets some time in the sun, and that's . . . well, that's just impressive. And despite the dull NYC ""big finale"", there was some exciting Summer spectacle herein (mostly in the fight scenes). But my favorite parts were during the quieter moments, when all the noise and CGI were dialed down. The movie works best when it's a bunch of competing heroes thrown together in a room.

"Poor in quality, but it was what it was meant to be","The Avengers has been one of the most anticipated movies of the year, arguably of the decade. When so many super heroes are in one movie, the fans and nerds will flock; and that's what they did. I would say that it did not disappoint. Mostly.Looking back on the experience, I have to say that the quality of The Avengers was surprisingly poor. the acting really didn't stand out with the exception of (guess who) Robert Downey Jr, completely overshadowing the rest of the cast. The dialogue, much like the acting was really skimpy. Most of the general conversation felt like it needed more time spent on it, and it seems most of the work went into the multitude of witty jokes that actually ended up working in their favor.The story, much like the dialogue, felt familiar, and at many times I couldn't help but feel a sense of deja vu in the plot twists and the action scenes. The pacing in the story was also off, and in between the intense and exciting action sequences I felt bored of the cheap, although sometimes hilarious dialogue.The characters were actually quite shallow. Individual character development was pretty much non-existent, with the movie focusing more on the relationships between the characters, and even that was shallow.However, all of this aside, The Avengers was actually a good movie. The plain fact is that this movie is absolutely everything that fans wanted, and with that was able to bury most of the problems it had under romping good fun, something that many other movies have tried and failed to do. The Hulk smashed, Iron Man blew stuff up, Captain America bashed the badies, etc. If there was any analogy to describe The Avengers, it would be that it is like UFC. It's kinda cheesy and doesn't take itself too seriously; however when the good guy slams the bad guy, everybody cheers. When Hulk smashed, the crowd erupted. When Loki says some snide comment, there was booing and hissing. The Avengers was not a good FILM, it was merely an exhibition of the superheroes power, and that was exactly what the fans came to see, and I can appreciate that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

More superheroes...,"First of all I must admit that I am not much particularly a fan of superheroes in general, but I have seen the movies leading up to this, simply because they were available and I had the time. And I had read up on the hype around this movie, so I might as well give it a go as well.And as a fairly non-superhero kind of guy, well I must say that ""The Avengers"" was one interesting and exciting ride of an action movie. The story was, for me at least, rather slow paced up to the point where the alien army came through the portal. Sure, it was building up character and getting the various characters introduced properly to those not having seen any of the prior movies.The effects in ""The Avengers"" were top notch, as to be expected from a movie of this caliber. Lots of really great effects and visuals. However, when that aircraft carrier ship started to transform and then fly, I was ready to turn off the movie. That was just silly. But I decided to keep watching and look past that one particular horrendous scene.However, one thing did make me wonder, with all the destruction in New York, you didn't see a single civilian getting hit or killed in any way, that was just stupid, especially with so many people living there. In fact, you only saw very few deaths throughout the entire movie, which was sort of lame.Another thing puzzled me, when Bruce Banner turned into The Hulk for the first time in the movie, he was out of control, smashing everything and everyone in sight. But somehow he magically overcame that and was fully in control the second time. That just seemed very implausible and sort of contradicted what we had just seen at the first transformation.And as with the previous Marvel movies with these characters, they had some great performances to the movie. I think that it was actually Tom Hiddleston who plays Loki who put on the most memorable performance in the movie and stood out the most.""The Avengers"" was good entertainment, even for an anti-superhero guy like myself.

The Avengers succeeded at one thing. Proving that IMDb is nothing more than what it really is. A database about movies and not a place to look for legitimate reviews.,"It's my first review here. The reason why i don't review movies here is simple. It's because English is not my first language. But i found the Avengers score to be so ridiculous that i decided to make my first review. The Avengers is not the first overrated or underrated movie here. But usually such overreaction about a movie last for 2 weeks or 1 month. After the fans saw and reviewed it the score adjust itself when the people not sold to the movie start to see it. But in the case of The Avengers it seems that there's so much people who gave The Avengers a not deserved 10 that to this day even after the disc release the score is still way too high. 8.4 ? More than Scarface and only 0.2 point away from Apocalyspe now. You got to be kidding me right ? But enough with my IMDb criticism here's my review of the movie.Personally i try to review movie with an open mind and rate a movie for what it is and what it tries to be. If a movie features some of the best special effects or action sequences ever i'm gonna consider it in my review. But what actually makes a good movie ? Directing, acting, casting, special effects, soundtrack, costume, script, editing, makeup, cinematography ... soul ? Personally i don't think a great movie needs to masterize all those. Few movies actually did. Shawshank Redemption was really close. But i think a great movie needs to be at the very least top in at the minimum 2 or 3 categories. So let's see for the Avengers. Let's start with the script. Honestly it's one of the worst script i've seen on the last 10 years. It makes Tron Legacy script looks like a chef-d'oeuvre. The directing ? This is where The Avengers shine a little bit and it's the only place it does. It's a miracle Joss was able to make something good out of this awful script. The acting was not bad but it was uneven. Tom Hiddleston did a good job as Lokki (Fassbender would have been better). Downey was good as usual but sorta under the autopilot. Ruffalo was okay but did not play a big role. Renner and Johansson did the best they could with uninteresting characters. But they were certainly not able to outdo themselves to make those characters interesting. Evans was awful as usual i can't stand this guy. Hemsworth was not really credible as a semi-god. But can't really blame him when a semi-god gets owned by a modern day Mr Hyde. Overall the acting was galaxies away from Fifth Element. I have a lot of respect for most of the actors in the Avengers. Who is to blame for the not exceptional acting ? The script ? The directing ? The casting ? Lack of interest in the project by the actors ? Maybe a little bit of all of those.Now let's get to the name of the game which is the action sequences and the special effects. And this is where i disagree with people giving this moving more than 7. While the special effects were technically great those were very far from being in the top league. Tron Legacy had far more interesting special effects and Tron Legacy did not succeed. Avatar was leagues over The Avengers. Avatar is major league. The Avengers is a farm club. Inception too even if i did not like it as much as i wanted to. The Avengers special effects don't have a soul. They are artistically nothing to write home about. I already forgot them. When i got out of the theater after seeing Avatar 3D i felt like when i was young and saw Terminator 2 for this first time. I felt something i had not felt in years. I was impressed by the special effects alone. Everything else was not important. The Avengers special effects are meh! It's like a 10 years old kid designed them and they spent millions over millions to make them technically look good. Now let's get to the action sequences. Hero is league over that. The firth Element is league over that. Terminator 2 is league over that. The Matrix is a god creation when it comes to action sequences if you compare it to the Avengers. Now i'm not saying the special effects and action sequences were bad. Cause they were good. What i'm saying is it's not worthy of a 8, 9 or 10 and not even close to it when you consider the script and uneven acting. The special effects and actions sequences were certainly not good enough to make this movie great. There's hundred and probably even thousand of movies with better special effects and action sequences (when you compare them to the movies released at the same time).Now when i started this review i intended to give the Avengers a 1 star. But doing so would make me as bad as the people who gave this movie a 10. So a decided to give it the score it deserves which is imo a 6.9. Now personally i think that IMDb should think about the way it calculates the weighted average. 10 and 1 rating weight way too much. Let's be honest for a second we have enough fingers to count the number of movies worthy of a 10 or 1. I'm astonished to see that close to 40% of the people gave The Avengers a 10. I really don't see how someone could think this movie is perfect. Even a fan of Marvel. The script alone is enough reason to reduce the score. I don't mind short movies with no script when they embrace it. But sadly the Avengers was close to 2 hours and a half and actually tried to tell a story. And this is where imo the movie actually failed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Most overrated movie of all time,"The movie was absolute trash. Horrible scripts, least menacing villain ever, no chemistry between the actors, and mundane story line. The movie was immensely over hyped and definitely does not deserve anything near a 8.5 rating. Its alright as a kids movie. It does not come anywhere near the unprecedented standards set by the dark knight or for that matter does not even come close to spiderman 2. The movie is often commended for its humor. In my opinion the humor is extremely dry and futile. Nothing special at all, despite its box office success it would have been better off as an animated movie. So if you want watch at least a decent super hero flick you might as well pick up Watchmen, X-men first class, Spider man 1 or 2 and of course the batman trilogy.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Amazing!!!!!,"I had the extreme pleasure of seeing this movie last weekend at a Facebook fan screening in Hollywood. I waited in line for 2 hrs to see this movie and was greeted by the surprise appearance of Writer/Director Josh Whedon, stars Chris ""Thor"" Hemsworh Tom ""Loki"" Hiddleston, Clark ""Agent Phil Coulson"", Cobie ""Maria Hill Smulders and Producer Kevin Feige and let me just say ... I would gladly stand in line for another 2 hrs to see it again...The Avengers in one word was ""AMAZING"" Josh Whedon and his cast and crew knocked this movie right out of the ball park and into a whole new cinematic universe !!! The action, humor and story were spot on. The action and characters were ripped right out of the pages and put right onto the screen., everything you love about the comics is there and then some. It was immediately obvious that this movie was made by the fans, for the fans... It dozen't matter if your a fan of comics or cartoons, everyone will find something to like about this movie. Just be prepared for a roller-coaster ride and a a great time at the movies!I have to say when I first heard Mr. Whedon was attached to direct, as a Buffy and Angel fan I was excited., But he succeeded all my expectations and then some. Anyone says you just can't write a good script with this many actors and give them all their own story arc should attend the Josh Whedon school of screen-writing... Mr. Whedon did a phenomenal job of handling each character providing every actor (big and small) their time to shine.The Avengers have assembled... and I can't wait to see them again an again !!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Marvel-lous!!!!!!!!!!!,"Writing a review for a hugely anticipated film just about to release worldwide is a very difficult thing but its equally if not more difficult to hold back your emotions when you've been extremely lucky to watch the most electrifying ensemble in the history of cinema thus far.Don't worry I'm not going to 'spoil' anything you wish to discover on our own accord. But when we talk about being disappointed because of the high expectations we had from a movie i can assure you that no matter how high your hopes may be pinned on this film you will not get be disappointed at any cost.Joss whedon has put together some of the most talented actors out there into a very sensibly written script(Funny, thrilling lacking even a single dull moment) to create what i would like to refer to as a phenomenal film which till now was considered only a rare possibility.I will say one thing though, while the film was still in development i was bit weary of Tom Middleton handling all these superheroes by himself, but to my amazement he was a total 'bad***',intense and menacing a supervillan to simplify what I'm trying to say! hats off to you mate!!! Just one word to sum it all up - MARVELLOUS.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"What's better than a superhero movie? A movie with six superheroes of course! The Avengers, is a masterpiece!","Could anyone imagine that the likes of Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America(Chris Evans), Hulk(Mark Ruffalo), Thor(Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow(Scarlett Johansson), & Hawkeye(Jeremy Renner) would come together for a movie?! Well they do, in The Avengers! The movie opens with a bang, as Loki(Tom Hiddleston) returns to Earth and wreaks havoc at the S.H.I.E.L.D headquarters. Loki steals the Tesseract, an energy source of unlimited potential. He puts Professor Erik Selvig(Stellan Skarsgard) & Hawkeye under his control & leaves with them. After the incident at the headquarters, Nick Fury(Samuel L. Jackson) decides that he has to reignite the Avengers Initiative, a project that had been canceled, only recently. In comes Black Widow aka Natasha Romanoff who starts recruiting superheroes to form The Avengers. First, she recruits Bruce Banner aka the Hulk who, until then, had been hiding in Calcutta, India. S.H.I.E.L.D needs Banner to check the potential of the Tesseract. The new recruit is Captain America who had been frozen for quite some time(these events took place in Captain America: The First Avenger) & woke up after being in a deep slumber for seventy years. After that, S.H.I.E.L.D recruits Tony Stark aka Iron Man. Thor joins the gang shortly thereafter. However, before the team can take on Loki, the heroes have to solve their personal issues & cut down their giant egos & work together as a team. Problematic? Yes! Iron Man's sarcasm only seems to worsen the situation. The way he makes fun of the others is hilarious!First off, I want to say something. The Avengers is the best movie of the year, so far! Be it the story, the superhero vs. superhero battles, or the sheer epic scale of the film. Loki, is the perfect super villain who is, evil & menacing. The 3D effect in this movie is just eye popping! You will literally duck down every ten seconds. The cinematography is brilliant. The way they've shown Calcutta is authentic. The battle in New York City is outstanding! A note on the performances. Robert Downey Jr. is spectacular as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Iron Man is my most favorite character in the film. Chris Evans is impressive as Steve Rogers/Captain America. Mark Ruffalo is outstanding as Bruce Banner/Hulk. Chris Hemsworth is awesome as Thor. Scarlett Johansson is great as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Jeremy Renner is effective as Clint Barton/Hawkeye. Tom Hiddleston is simply wicked as Loki. Even though he's the only villain in the movie he's pulled it off superbly. Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Coulson, Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill & Stellan Skarsgard as Selvig are superb as well. So, grab your 3D glasses, buy some popcorn, sit back & relax as you watch the most entertaining movie in recent times! Don't miss this on the big screen no matter what people! Now, let's see if The Amazing Spider-Man or The Dark Knight Rises top this one. The bar has been set very high though!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
As Much Fun As I've Ever Had In The Cinema!!!!!!!!!,"Ladies and gentlemen, WE HAVE A WINNER! Most Superhero comic book movies seem to share a problem in tone. Most films try to cope with wild concepts by emphasizing darkness, even over-emphasizing it. Troubled, brooding characters, black leather and anger rule the day. Here, the Avengers mix everything so well. It leans to the dark but touches on fun and the interaction of every character just enough. Maybe it's the fact that all the lead characters got their chance to be introduced in their own movies or maybe it's because they wanted genuinely real dialogue but the movie feels real and believable. It's truly better than any other comic-book based movie that I have ever seen. I say that not to egg on fans of other properties because I AM a fan of other properties. Because of the groundwork that has come before and because of the high level that this film operates, it IS bigger than any have ever delivered. ALL the dramatic beats really click. Besides the depth and action pieces, so much of the humor works because it is so well written. The writing displays true character establishment and development over the course of the film but never gets bogged down by the shear number of characters. What's also rare for any summer movie is that just about every scene packs real emotional weight. This is what you get when you mix fine acting talent with outstanding material. They make it shine and give you a remarkable movie that people will be talking about for years to come. The TV clips seen leading up to the movie tease at the action but there is SO much they saved for the actual running. I can't thank them enough for that factor. They knew they had a hit on their hands so why spoil the word of mouth! If you liked the trailers and TV stuff, YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING YET! That in and of itself was a pleasant surprise. Avengers is a complete and very well done movie and as much fun as I've ever had in the cinema. That's no lie or no joke.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great Movie... But Not That Great,"Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) of S.H.I.E.L.D. brings together a team of super humans to form The Avengers to help save the Earth from Loki and his army.I want to first address the IMDb rating on this film. Currently, it sits at an 8.3 and is said to be the 140th greatest film of all time. Now, no matter how good you think it is, does anyone seriously believe it is one of the greatest films ever made? I mean, really? I grew up reading comic books, so the films are a bit of a different experience for me than they are for others. I think the movies have the comic fans as their biggest base, which is good, because otherwise several references and foreshadowings are going to be missed. If you do not know who Hawkeye is, for example, it may cause you to wonder why a government agent is jumping around and shooting off strange arrows.My biggest concern was: how do you make a movie about a team where the individuals have such strong personalities? Particularly the Hulk, who is not a team player. This was addressed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Avengers,"It took four years to make The Avengers, by Joss Whedon but it was well worth the wait. The story takes place in New York, in 2012. The Avengers are made up of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye ( Jeremy Renner). The main antagonist of the movie is Loki (Tom Hiddleston). The movie is an Action/ Comedy / Adventure/Sci-fi film. The movie is two hours and twenty three minutes long and by the end you don't want it to be over. In the beginning we find out that Earth has found the Tesseract, an object that can provide an unlimited source of potential energy. It suddenly activates and opens a portal to another world where Loki comes out of. Loki threatens to wage war upon Earth. Now it's up to Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) to find a way to stop him. He is part of an organization called S.H.I.E.L.D. and he brings together a team of super humans to form The Avengers to save the Earth from Loki and his army. Along the way The Avengers get into arguments, which allows Loki to get away. Loki ends up opening the portal again and his army is able to come to Earth. Will the Avengers be able to stop Loki and his army? You will have to see the movie to find out.I loved the acting in this movie. I think that's what made the movie what it is. I don't think I could choose one favorite, but if I had to it would have to be between The Hulk and Iron Man. The Hulk is my favorite because he is a genius when he is ""normal"" and he smashes everything when he turns into the Hulk. The funniest part of the movie would be when The Hulk punches Thor while fighting Loki army. The only thing I didn't like was that he only became The Hulk two times throughout the entire movie. Iron Man maybe my favorite because he is funny and cool. He is funny and intelligent thought the entire movie. He is funny, for example, when Captain America asks Iron Man, ""If you take off you armor what are you?"" which Iron Man responds with, ""Uh... genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.""Another thing I really liked about this movie is the story. Not for one second did I find the movie boring or unenjoyable. I kept my eyes glued to the screen. The movie has all the things a movie needs. For example the movie has humor, action, and an amazing cast. Also I think all the characters have the right amount lines and everything is distributed evenly, not one actor is more superior to the other.All in all I think the story was amazingly written.After reading this review I bet you understand that I loved this movie. Everything about this movie, in my opinion is perfect. I would recommend everyone to see this movie and not only at home but go to the theater and see it there. You will not enjoy it at home as much as you would in theaters. I would give this a 10/10, or a must see movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Marvelous action, but average characters in an average superhero movie","This movie is getting immensely good reviews, universal critical acclaim. I'd hate to be the sore thumb standing out giving the movie an average review, or what sounds below-average compared to all the other reviews, but I was having a hard time enjoying this movie. Part of the problem was an overwhelmingly distracting midnight-premiere audience. I liked it better the second time, a few weeks later when the theater was much less attended, but not a whole lot because of reasons I'll explain next.Though this is a combination superhero movie, the idea of which I really like, and though it's likable how the interactions between the heroes was important, I wasn't so completely sure the relationships between the heroes was very believable. Sometimes it seemed so, but not really. I expected there to be more time devoted to the heroes getting to know each other, as if they were actually unaware of each other before the start of the movie, but instead they all knew each other pretty well pretty early. It seemed the heroes showed a little less respect to each other than they probably should have. In fact, in several parts, heroes got into fights with each other, which I really don't like seeing in the movies. I would have liked to see Captain America, my personal favorite of the Avengers heroes, in more of a leadership role than what he was given. But would the Captain's shield, forged by mortal Muggles back in the 1940's, really be able to deflect Iron Man's or Loki's power beams (which is maybe just a minor complaint)? Speaking of Loki, he and his brother are back from Thor, and Loki seemed to stand out a little more as a good villain than he did in Thor. But then there is the awkward situation that those characters, as gods or demigods or whatever you call them, contribute to the story. This combination superhero movie makes the point that a team of superheroes can do more than what one superhero could do by himself. But because Loki, a god, was the main bad guy, I spent most of the movie believing that Thor, also a god, would have been the only hero capable of stopping Loki.I would also have liked to see more of the supporting characters from the pre-Avengers movies show up in this movie. Erik Selvig from Thor and Pepper Potts from Iron Man were good showing up, and it had to have been hard bringing back most or all of the Captain America characters what with them being from the 1940's. But I wish we could have seen Don Cheadle (or Terrence Howard) as Rhodey from the Iron Man movies, William Hurt as General Ross from The Incredible Hulk, Anthony Hopkins as Odin from Thor, or the heroes' girlfriends, Liv Tyler as Betty Ross from The Incredible Hulk, Natalie Portman as Jane Foster from Thor, or Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter from Captain America (pictures of Jane and Peggy both appeared briefly, so that was okay). The existing supporting characters were good for the most part, particularly Nick Fury and Phil Coulson (though I don't know how Nick Fury's apparent lack of superpowers puts him in a rightful place to lead S.H.I.E.L.D. or a team of superheroes). But I also have to say it was awkward that Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow) and Clint Barton (Hawkeye) were on the Avengers team. Though Romanoff is pretty good at spying and kicking butt, she's not a superhero. I'm sure that some showbiz news story reported back in 2009 or so that Black Widow would be a villain alongside Whiplash in Iron Man 2, but it was a disappointment to me watching Iron Man 2 that she never turned out to be a villain (she's still not a villain in The Avengers). Her name ""Natalie Rushman"" as used in Iron Man 2 seems to be completely fake, and her name ""Black Widow"" was used a couple times in The Avengers, which was infinitely more than the number of times it was used in Iron Man 2. And why is she called ""Black Widow""? She's not African-American, she doesn't have a dead husband (that I know of), and she was never bitten by a radioactive spider. Hawkeye doesn't have any interesting or significant name either, and his superpower is nothing more than notable skill in using a bow and arrow, and though he appeared briefly in Thor, which I didn't notice the first time I watched it, I couldn't tell how his involvement made the movie much more interesting. So describe this movie as being about four superheroes (not five or six or seven), one supervillain, a supervillain's army of evil baddies, and four Muggle supporting heroes. Maybe I'm just not familiar with the comic books these characters are based on, and maybe I'm just overthinking this a little too much.On the other hand, the action was marvelous, and if I was to judge this movie entirely by its action, it would be the best or almost best action movie ever made. While still sitting in the theater my first time, I was a little bothered by how pessimistic about this I seemed to be, but walking out of the theater I felt a little more optimistic, that I'm sure I'll like this more when I see it more times.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Holy Mother God Almighty!  What a film!,"The Avengers is truly a film that should be considered an instant classic. Joss Whedon does more than do justice to getting four superheroes on the screen, but he makes a tremendous yarn to go with it. Yes, the greatest strength of the film is the screenplay. The one liners are a keeper, and it comes with some great performances as well, particularly with Robert Downey, Jr and Mark Ruffalo. The film entertains in action, succeeds in comedy, and manages to be one of the greatest films we're bound to see this summer, and potentially one of the best films we'll see of the year. And an end note, if you do a sequel, please keep Joss Whedon. Without him, expect The Avengers 2 to be less entertaining overall.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

And this thing applies for 99% of the Marvel movies and about 80% for DC.

Best Superhero Movie Ever Made,"All I can say is ""WOW!"". After watching patiently every superhero movie since the original Superman in 1978 (most of them many times), I realize now that *this* was the one I have been waiting for. To say it was great would be incredibly unjust - there aren't many words to REALLY convey just how special it is. From the casting to the performances to the writing to the fine details to the effects to the dynamic interplay of the characters, this movie is simply hands down the BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER MADE. I wont give any of it away, and there were too many moments to even begin to describe anyway, but I will for sure be going back to see it at least a couple more times (which I NEVER do)and its one of the very few I will for SURE purchase when it is available. Instant classic, and a defining moment for the superhero movie genre. On the way out of the IMAX 3D theater where I saw it, beyond being simply stunned, I had 2 further immediate thoughts: 1) It was SO mind-numbing, and SO far above any superhero movie I have ever seen, that it reminded me of seeing the 1st Lord of The Rings movie (Fellowship) and how I was similarly stunned and literally dazed upon exiting the cinema... 2) I cant for the life of me figure out WHY the powers that be at DC have not yet come out with a Justice League movie in a similar ensemble fashion - their management is asleep at the wheel if that is NOT in development.Anyway back to the movie itself: Go see it, multiple times. You will thank me later.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Isn't it great when a film not only lives up to the hype, but surpasses it!?!?!","Man, what a ride! And I am not just talking about this movie itself, but the entire journey it took getting here! Ever since Iron Man in 2008, The Marvel Cinematic Universe has been a blast, with, addition to Iron Man, we also had The Incredible Hulk(2008),Iron Man 2(2010), and last year's two heavy hitters Thor and Captain America:The First Avenger. Now, it all comes to a head in Marvel's The Avengers, in what is, in short, the best comic book film since The Dark Knight!!!!!!!! The plot is mostly centered around Loki(Tom Hiddleston), who is, after being sucked into the black hole at the end of Thor,coming to Earth after finding a way into our realm. S.H.I.E.L.D has been using the tesseract(the weapon Red Skull used in Captain America)for experiments, and Loki uses this as a way to come to Earth. Using a staff that can cross dimensions, given to him by his new army,the Chitauri(an evil alien race),Loki has a master plan to unleash his army upon the world, and when all has settled, Loki will be declared humanity's new king.In response to this act of war, Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D(Samuel L. Jackson), decides to restart the Avenger program. Recruiting Iron Man/Tony Stark(Robert Downey, Jr.), Steve Rogers/Captain America(Chris Evans) and Bruce Banner/The Hulk(Mark Ruffalo), along with Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow(Scarlett Johansson), they begin to put a stop to Loki's evil plan. Eventually,Loki's ""brother"" Thor(Chris Hemsworth)shows up, with an intent to take Loki back to Asgard.Loki is not making it easy, however, as he has converted a number of S.H.I.E.L.D members to his side, including Dr. Eric Selvig(Stellan Skarsguard), a scientist who is designing the portal to let Loki's army through, and Clint Barton/Hawkeye(Jeremy Renner),a brilliant marksman and one of Black Widow's closest allies. In order to stop this grave threat, differences must be set aside, difficult choices must be made, and a team will have to come together in stop Loki and the Chitauri army.Avengers Assemble, indeed! For anyone worrying that this wouldn't be the definitive payoff to four years and five films of anticipation can put those fears to rest, because this was..............INCREDIBLE! There are so many things to discuss and give praise for in this movie, so let's start at the beginning.First off, the cast is brilliant,with everybody giving a incredible performance. Tony Stark is my favorite character in all of these films, and RDJ is as great as ever! So dry humored and sarcastic, yet so heroic and likable. Chris Evans builds on an already good performance, making Cap even better this time around. Always thought Hemsworth was terrific as Thor, and he still owned the role here! Can't wait to see him again. Scarlett was very good as Widow, and had great chemistry with the rest of the cast. Jeremy Renner is good as Haweye, but is easily the least fleshed out of the characters. Still, likable and has some good moments. Loki is back, and Hiddleston shines again. If he was heart-wrenching and tragic in Thor, he is scary and menacing here, yet still giving some insight into his pain.The big surprise here is Ruffalo as Banner. I think he was the one that most were skeptical about, as he wasn't carried over for the previous films. However, color me impressed. Ruffalo is fantastic as Banner, having great chemistry with the cast, giving Banner enough a soul so we care for him, and when he is the Hulk(using motion capture and CGI), he has some great, audience cheering moments. All the rest of the cast give great performances,including Skarsguard, Gwnyeth Paltrow as Pepper from Iron Man 1 and 2, and of course Mr. Jackson as Fury.The action scenes were phenomenal. Marvel's own movies aren't exactly known for the action scenes,and as much as I liked the action in those movies,particularly Iron Man 2,Thor, and Incredible Hulk,the action is fantastic,and easily the best action scenes in any superhero movie ever! The script is well-written and full of action. A lot of people have commented that the film looks like the action scenes from the Transformers movies. But I think something must be said here:the action is far better than in those movies. The characters are actually flesh and blood, which grounds it much more in reality, and puts far more at stake. They may have superhuman skills, but they are still human.Can't say that for the Transformers movies.Plus, the characters are played as intelligent, heroic and full of personality, unlike the characters in those films.All in all, this deserves accolade upon accolade. Kudos to Joss Whedon,the cast and crew of this and the other five films,and Marvel for making this a reality! Can't wait to watch them all one day in one long marathon! In short(ironic,considering this was a LONG review)although Batman will still rule the summer,for now, MAKE MINE MARVEL!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The story had the perfect balance of comedy, action and drama (yes, there's a bit of that too and it's good). It's everything a comic book fan would want out of a comic book adaptation movie.Every member of the Avengers line-up (whether super powered or not) got the right amount of screen time; if you were like me and thought that Iron Man would get accidentally hog the screen because the trailers made the movie look like ""IRON MAN AND FRIENDS,"" your fears will be washed away.Josh Whedon pulled off the impossible; he wrote and directed a perfect comic book adaptation.

one hell of a movie!!!!!!,"I AM HULK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The Powerhouse, the boiling bed, the grizzly, machismo and the Ultimate hammer-head, he knows how to pump up your very source of adrenaline.I regret that I watched this movie late- but it was due to my exams that I wasn't able to do so. But if you still haven't seen it yet, I tell you bluntly, you are a fool!'Avengers' is the best super-action movie I have ever seen!!!It's not due to the story, not due to the theme, not due to the super- star cast. The real hero of this movie was the awesome special effects and of course, that includes Hulk.The arena is all set. We have Ironman, Hawkeye, Thor, Hulk, CaptainAmericaand Black Widow to set the stage on fire. And what are they facing? Gargantuan, bulk bio-mechanical aliens with a centralized connection system, they lay down the New York City to dust, smoke and metallic rubble.There wasn't a single moment that you actually feel bored or out of place. This movie kept me glued to the screen throughout.Now, for the characters..Hawkeye: He is a good guy, turned bad guy, then once again into a good guy. Don't let his metamorphosis confuse you. Because his explosive arrow (for those who understand 'brahmasthra'!) indeed made me reminiscent of the good old fight between Hindu Gods and Demons. He is good, but still, just a little bit less than the others.Black Widow: Don't even dare take her at her face value. She is never what she appears to be. She is docile and meek when she wants to leech out information from you, but ruthless and super daring when she stomps down the aliens to their gory end. Best scene- The way she takes control of the alien ship. She may soon stump down Emma Watson as my favourite heroine.Thor: He is a force to reckon with, literally. The power to wield thunderbolts never ever ceases to amaze me. And it didn't in this movie. There was an awesome fight sequence between Ironman and Thor. Best Scene: The way he makes the entire skyscraper an electric conductor and focuses the electricity on the warp hole, blowing the bulky, snaky aliens to smithereens.Captain America: Though low on actual power, he can still wield his shield and send Thor flying away distances. He is the Captain Cool, one who likes to plan out things and do accordingly. A tad old-fashioned (of course he is old-fashioned- he is old, the scientists literally thawed him back to life!!) but he more than makes up with his patriotism and his iron-will to see it through the end.Ironman: A billionaire, genius and a philanthropist. Ironman is indeed the superhero with panache. He can be the style icon for all the superheroes- the way he undoes his suit is awesome, uber cool gadgetry, superb dialogues and a sexy iron suit that can do cool different tricks. Oh Man! He was simply superb. Of course he takes away the cake, when he directs the nuclear missile through the warp hole and into the heart of the alien stronghold.Hulk: No comparison. He, according to me, was the life and soul of this movie. Well, I must complain- that these Hollywood blockbusters always show India in poor light, even though that part does not represent India as a whole. Maybe they have the 'Great Indian Poverty Fetish' or the 'Dharavi Syndrome'. Well, but this feeling of being disparaged does not last long as we soon see the Doctor 'awakening the green bulky giant within' and being transformed into Hulk. There are actually three 'City Moment of Success' related to him. 1) The way he pounds the great snaky alien to dust. 2) The way he punches Thor. 3) Now this was the best scene of the move- he thrashes up Loci in the very Chota Bheem style- that was awesome. I can still remember the reaction that Loci gave..Maybe it doesn't have much of a story. But alien invasion movies are not meant to have one. What they are meant to have is spectacular fireworks, and this had those aplenty.Every time, I see a movie like this- my heart pumps faster, my whole body gets filled with tout electrical energy. It is as if, I were a character inside the movie. I loved the feeling, I loved the movie.Miss it at your own peril",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
OK....for what it's trying to be.,"I appreciate this film for what it is. An all out action popcorn movie that aims to wow the audience with its cutting edge effects, fancy camera work and ability to not have to think, and just sit back. The plot was pretty simple and nothing new in terms of old clichéd, alien guy tries to take over the world with his army and big doomsday device scenario with an ending we have seen a million times before with a ""Lets destroy a city with as much explosions and CGI as possible"" chapter. Don't get me wrong, they did a great job with it. Some of the camera work was excellent, much better than Micheal Bay's close up and shake the camera around everywhere technique. But for me personally I don't like being overwhelmed with all the CGI and the camera taking me away from the characters involvement of the scene and scenario and focusing on the effects. The only thing that kept me going till the end was the humor. If it was not for that I would have rated this film as just another bland CGI bonanza. A good attempt, but for me, not as amazing as everyone is making it out to be. The effect's are amazing, the humor is good, but everything else..seen it before..bored of it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Avengers are A +,"An example of inspiring cinema directed for young and old alike, ""The Avengers"" is does it all in this recent block buster. I agree with Rabbi Scott of Houston's Congregation Emanu El, when he described the pleasure he derived from the mesmerized youngsters in the audience as much as his own enjoyment of this super hero film. Robert Downey, Jr. is Iron Man once again, and he gives another uniformly perfect performance. Chris Evans is Captain America, and he too is outstanding as this superman-like individual fighting for truth and justice and the ""American Way"". Mark Ruffalo plays Dr. Bruce Banner/ The Hulk and he too is well cast and successful with his part. Thor is portrayed by Chris Hemsworth, and he too is exemplary with his performance. Of course, there is Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, the leader of this brave crew. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff, is very convincing and an extremely tough ingénue in a film which is not directed by Woody Allen. Joss Whedon has written and directed this smash hit in 3D, and I advise that it be seen with this medium, since the special effects are enhanced to the point of overwhelming reality. Don't miss this remarkable Marvel comic piece. It is worth the effort for you and all the youngsters in the audience who will be glued to the screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Avengers did assemble. But are they really so great?,"I went to see The Avengers in a movie theater in Paris. It actually seemed kind of strange that it premiered there a week before it did in the United States. Nevertheless, I wanted to watch it in order to prove to myself that some Marvel Universe productions based on comic books can be outstanding. Unfortunately, as I left my seat I thought that, like all the previous one-superhero- shows, it disappointed me entirely.Why, should you ask?Basically, the plot is childish, but I wouldn't expect more from a big budget blockbuster made only to pleasure the masses. As of now, it can somehow achieve the greatest opening ever. Wow. It already made a fortune from the great marketing campaign that started weeks before the opening day. That's truly brilliant, considering WHAT is being advertised throughout the world as one of the best movies in years.I must admit, it is strangely awesome that they were able to assemble such a cast of stars and pack them into one two-hour film. The names speak for themselves. But what can be achieved with so many highly-paid actors when the whole idea behind the picture seems dull? I love to see all of the well-known faces shown on the screen together at one particular moment, but when the scene isn't entertaining the point is really becoming unimportant.The dialogues are cheap. They do not show any insight into the characters' positions in the circle of The Avengers. Of course, in order to fully understand who is who and the relations between the heroes it is mandatory to watch all of the movies that show the origins of every single person.Now I want to point point some out a few aspects that make the movie a little more enjoyable. There were a few nicely implied gags that made me laugh. Most of them were connected with Hulk's turbulent nature. And that is always a good thing to make fun of. Also the many sarcastic, but highly intelligent remarks made by Tony Stark made me believe that Iron Man must certainly be the most amazing guy in the entourage. Additionally I would like to note that you don't have to watch the movie in 3D in order to get the best experience (the enormous potential of this technology isn't actually given). All of the epic major explosions, blasts, rampages and spectacular fights are providing great special effects in themselves. This is the part that is probably the most pleasurable - when the Avengers team do not speak to each other, but just fight their way through evil forces in order to stop Loki, Thor's brother. Action sequences are decent and the camera motions that shifts between all of the battling heroes deserve a recognition.All in all, I have to say that I would much rather read the comic book while riding a subway to work than waste my time seating in the cramped cinema on a Thursday evening. Now I just have to hope that all the other 2012 epic superhero productions will be better. Because even after this 'slight' disappointment I still believe that this year will provide the greatest entertainment in this genre that the world has ever seen.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Absolutely Masterful!!!!!!! 10/10,"What a well executed script, perfect cast(edward norton couldn't make it better), and awesome mix of action, comedy and humor. ( Probably the best villain in movie history, Loki the Awesome One.) Exciting, Action, Packed and the usual Tony Stark. I believe when people expected the rating to be: Hah! Avenger?! Must be a 5... WHAT THE... Have to go to a theatre, and when you watch it and go to theatre it is absolutely as good as they it is. Loki is a very awesome character indeed. He completes the movie with his shear charisma, the armor he wears is MINDBLOWING!!! The Hulk is an essential character as well, he completes the comical aspect. The Black Widow, this smoking red hot beauty is a burst of adrenaline, Captain America is probably the least noticeable of all. Thor played a really flash, in completing the storyline of Loki. Last but not least the ""Rockstar"" brought to you by AC/DC Tony Stark the witty multi-billionaire playboy is the parallel equivalent to Bruce Wayne. What can we say Folks? This movie could have turned out horribly or at least parly but instead it has surpassed and exceeded everyone's expectation. A real Hollywood blockbuster.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spitting in the Faces of Serious Movie-Watchers,"An article I read summed up The Avengers as ""The Anti-Dark Knight,"" which is NOT a bad thing. It's just about as quality, but rather than being dark and gritty, this movie is fun with hilarious, yet intelligent dialogue. This is the truest comic book film. No, we're not given a bad pun about the villain's costume in the middle of really intense scenes. The movie is intense, intelligent, hilarious, and fun, which is a very odd combo for a movie one would expect to be very Hollywood.This movie spits in the faces of more serious movie-watchers. Even they will get absorbed into this movie for many reasons. Usually, in a Hollywood movie with the success this one was expected to accumulate, you'd see more sex and idiots on screen twisting the plot in the most ridiculous of ways. Well, Scarlett Johansson is not used for seduction on other characters or sexual appeal to viewers. She is here to play Black Widow and be a crucial part of the film! As for idiots, there are none. The characters in this movie are all smart and necessary to the story. All of them do a great job! Even Mark Ruffalo, whose presence will make you forget the great Norton was even the Hulk first.The story is just about as well-balanced as one could hope for between intelligence, action, tension, and flow. The characters' backgrounds are all tied together very well, and the story isn't centered around one character too much more than another. The main characters all get equal screen time and importance to the movie's monumentally huge and intelligent plot. For those who complain we're not given enough depth on characters, we were given a good amount of depth. If we would've gone any more in depth on any one of the characters, the flow of the movie would've succeeded less. We see enough from everyone.To cap this movie off, the action was superb! It's always exciting anytime there is fighting sequences, which are plentiful. The special effects are really well-done, which is expected from a movie with such a budget as this one had to work with. The money was all put to good use. Great action, great actors, great directing, great plot, great dialogue, great movie!!The only complaints one could have is ""They didn't stick with the comic books"" or ""These guys weren't the original Avengers."" This is a film. You cannot directly copy a comic exactly when making a comic book movie. It's a movie. It stands alone. Other complaints are just a few bad lines that are easily pardoned with how much the rest of the script outweighs the few bad lines.This movie spits in the faces of serious movie-watchers. It surely did in mine. I didn't think I'd come across a movie with such an ominous plot in which the manner of the characters isn't totally serious. This is the one great film that was able to do that and still maintain a level of greatness that it does. This is one of the greatest 2000's films. I rank it right up there with The Dark Knight, Return of the King, City of God, Inception, etc. One of the greats of our time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very entertaining. Superhero ensemble done right.,"Over the past five years we have been exposed to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which has introduced us to a multitude of characters. Finally, it all comes to a head in this massive ensemble. Following the arrival of the Norse God Loki (Tom Hiddleston), S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) assembles a team of six of the most powerful individuals the world has ever seen to combat the threat. However, their egos and suspicions of one another create a lot of friction in the group. Many feared that the screen time of this film would be dominated by a single character, with the rest simply playing supporting roles. They needn't have worried, as each Avenger is given an appropriate amount of attention. Returning to their roles from the previous Marvel films are Robert Downey Jr. as the pretentious yet well-meaning industrialist Tony Stark/Iron Man, Chris Evans as the recently resurrected World War II hero Steve Rogers/Captain America, Chris Hemsworth as Norse God Thor (Loki's stepbrother) and Scarlett Johansson as enigmatic spy Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Jeremy Renner expands upon his brief cameo in ""Thor"" as Clint Barton/Hawkeye, by far the most interesting member of the group. Replacing Edward Norton as Bruce Banner/The Hulk is Mark Ruffalo, who fills the role surprisingly well. Badass as usual is Jackson as Fury. We also see quite a lot of fan favorite Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg), who makes his most memorable appearance so far. Returning in supporting roles are Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Dr. Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard). Introduced in this film is Agent Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders), who doesn't really get enough screen time to make a proper impression. While the entire cast is solid, the best performance by far is by Hiddleston. As the film's primary villain, he cuts an imposing figure, peering a death glare at the audience and relishing every word as he attempts to get inside the heroes' heads. Director Joss Whedon, the man behind ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" and ""Firefly"", once again shows his ability to create a well-made ensemble piece. Following in the footsteps of Jon Favreau, Kenneth Branagh, Louis Letterier and Joe Johnston, he was the ideal choice for this film. Whedon was able to cover all of the necessary areas, from the emotional impact of the death of a major character, to the film's many moments of humor and the many heart-racing action scenes. Another triumph is the film's special effects. The motion capture used to create the Hulk has made him look more realistic than any previous live-action portrayal, Loki's army of Chitauri aliens are a convincing force to be reckoned with and vehicles are created that could never exist in reality. Furthermore, Whedon alumni Alexis Denisof is unrecognizable as The Other, a mysterious villain who hints at what is going on behind the scenes (and what will come to the front in future installments). While it won't win any Oscars, The Avengers succeeds in all of the intended areas. A character-driven story with heart, action and humor, it brings these iconic characters to the big screen in a way that does them justice, and will thrill audiences from beginning to end.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I guess i am too old,"I saw this movie without any expectations, the trailer did not entice me at all but took my 11 year old and 16 year old son, of course I saw the high ratings from IMDb and thought OK I got to go see it.My first impression was totally predictable, second not at all impressed with the 3 d effects so, I guess I have to sum it up to either At the age of 46 I am way to old old. But then again I was not a big transformers fan.Everyone said this movie was really funny OK was it the dry homor or the hulk slapping Thor, in any case did not fall off my seat laughing.

"Gloriously entertaining, and extremely well-balanced across its large cast of characters","Avengers (all right, ""Avengers Assemble"" if you insist) is really quite extraordinarily good. It's pretty much everything that's fun about superhero comics translated directly onto the screen - I was hoping for as much from Joss Whedon and he delivered.Like Serenity and the Buffy season 5 finale, it's extremely well-structured so that everyone gets more than one moment to shine in both dialogue and action scenes; I can't think of another action movie that has so many characters and is so well-balanced between them all, and all the different combinations of arguments and team-ups between them.It's also extremely funny (but *mostly* not in that trademark Joss Whedon ""Buffyspeak"" way that some VERY WRONG people find ""precious"" and annoying). It has better Tony Stark dialogue than either Iron Man movie! Having said that, the funniest gags are visual ones that involve the Hulk...I often complain that superhero films' weakest parts tend to be their climactic action sequences: the stakes are raised, and believability is strained. Well, for once we have a superhero film whose best action scene comes at the end. It's one of the best-sustained action finales since The Matrix - and much better-directed than the incomprehensible shots of The Dark Knight. It's constantly spectacular and contains countless satisfying moments in both action and dialogue - most of which also happen to be very funny.But the best *single scene* in the whole film isn't an action scene! A standard phrase Joss Whedon has used in promotional interviews is ""I wanted to figure out why all these different characters should even be in the same room as each other"". Well, that scene where they *are* all in the same room as each other turned out to be the film's absolute highlight. Scenes like that are what I'll look forward to on subsequent viewings. There have been lots of action films that I've enjoyed at the cinema for their sheer spectacle but then have felt little desire to re-watch because that they didn't have much else going for them (Avatar comes to mind) - but this isn't one of them.The film's plot isn't exactly intricate: it's extremely tightly focused around the MacGuffin from Thor and Captain America. However, this isn't a bad thing: in a film of this scale, ensuring the characterisation and action is satisfying is an ambitious balancing act as it is, without adding a complex twisty-turny plot to the mix as well.The film doesn't carry any sort of larger real-world message; it's really just a movie about these specific characters - about guys in silly costumes beating the living daylights out of each other. But as far as movies about guys in silly costumes beating the living daylights out of each other go... well, it's hard to imagine how they could get much better.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The people who rated this film have to be under 15 years of age,"First off. There is no way this film is even close to a 9 rating (it's at 8.8 or something now) NO WAY.The people who are saying the film is a 9 are most likely hyper teenagers who sit home all day, and don't read anything, and watch reality TV - they don't know what is good and what is terrible.This film is dull. Has no emotion (forced doesn't count), and often times is ridiculous. Though what saves it is the fact it makes fun of itself which is funny. Normally I would rate really low but that humour makes it a little better.It was well done for what it is. But I think what happened is the last few comic book movies (except for batman) were so bad that people were surprised with this one, expecting it to suck. So I read things like this is the greatest film ever, or ""A+"" rating. You have to be joking.One of the things that really gets to me is one part in particular. The HULK Is this un-controllable force. He almost destroys the ship.Makes sense.Then next thing you know he is fighting ALONG with the avengers. UM..HELLO!!?? how the hell did that happen. Oh they magically tamed the beast or something? Banner says ""my secret is I always stay angry"" (something like that) and then turns into the hulk and starts fighting the aliens. This makes no sense.So if he had this mentality all along why did he want to kill everyone on the ship? Nothing was learned. I mean he saves Iron Man later. But on the ship he wanted to kill Thor and others. ????? HUGE GAP. Anyone with half a brain would question this.I enjoy watching this more in cartoon form because the ridiculousness makes sense.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Dumbed down irrelevant nonsense,"Honestly, I like the odd superhero movie but the makers of this are like the fat kid in Willy The Wonka who has to have all the chocolate.This production (sic) treats the entire audience as low IQ zombies (no offence to actual zombies intended). There is zero depth of character development and zero story line interest. At no time whatsoever do you ever feel a sense of suspense or danger. At no time do you care if any of the characters come to harm - well you kind of know that none of them will as their superheroes - obviously. And why even bother having humans with no super powers - Oh I forgot, the humans in it are the most magical, unbelievable fighting machines. They just stand there wasting anything in their path, and Im not talking about the super heroes here. Rambo is but a beginner compared to them.Every single facet of this farce is totally predictable from start to finish. Its one of those where you pray your transported to another reality and the bad guys actually win.Technically its all good except the sound department have again gone mental. The action scenes are incredibly loud and were at times quite painful on the ears (seriously) and then the speaking parts were often so whispered and muffled sounding. I'm sure during post the sound guys sit there with the best sound system money can buy - but the reality is their mix doesn't translate well across systems. Bad sound isn't the problem, its the post mixing. I hear this issue on far to many movies these days and its ruining many films.The acting by some of the cast is decent, considering the ridiculously poor script they have to work with. But in no way will any of them be remembering their part in this movie during their twilight years. This is a money and profile job - nothing more. Even then I do have to wonder if putting your name to this is actually worth it?. The directing is amateur hour. His/her (I don't know and don't care) focus is squarely on action and FX - so why not just have the FX team direct it as they certainly would have done a better job than the lucky ducky who managed to land this lucrative job. I do wonder if the director has actually ever watched a movie to see how one directs actors?Anyway, I cant say much more about this nonsense except if you enjoy a movie which is one long mind numbing boring action scene, aimed at a dumbed down populace - then this is for you.PS I cannot believe this movie gained so much favourable reviews. I certainly smell a rat.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Truly Perfect Superhero Films..,"I went into this movie with very high expectations cause I watched all the trailers about 30 times each. I will say from the very first 10 minutes of the films I was instantly blown away by the action and the course of the story. All the characters in this film get an equal amount of screen time, which is usually the problem in a film where you deal with multiple characters such as in this film. I applaud Joss Whedon for making this Marvel Masterpiece, the way everything fits together in this film is truly amazing and its close to impossible to find any holes in the story. Mr Whedon was the perfect person to have dealt with telling this story as he's a comic book fan, he nailed it 100%. I believe i'm going to see this film again tomorrow, it is just that awesome.

Entertaining Night Out,"Just got back from seeing the Avengers and have to say that I enjoyed it. It had a non- stop feel and some of the best action sequences I've seen. Is it a great action movie? Absolutely! Is it one of the best superhero movies ever? I'm not an expert in the genre, but I bet it is. Was it one of the top 50 overall movies of all time? No way!I was really shocked when I saw an IMDb rating of almost 9 for this movie and I'm hoping that over time, cooler heads will prevail and bring the movie's rating down into the 7's where it likely belongs.I found that the writing was fine for an action movie but I certainly didn't lose myself in the reality of it all. There were a number of sequences where the dialogue and interactions of the characters was not believable or compelling.I apologize to those who would quip that dramatic dialogue and characters with whom the audience can empathize don't belong in this type of film but I think they do and I'm sure we'll see it someday.Go see this movie - well worth the trip to the theater to see it on the big screen.

Highly overrated!,"Don't know what people linked in the movie... the action starts pretty late almost 1 hr into the film, action sequences pretty common based in city streets as seen in a few other movies, though little comedy by hulk makes action scenes bearable. One other thing ""why would the army build by Loki be of aliens""... thats funny right, why will be the person claiming to be God have an army of powerless aliens with guns and spaceships...The first hour of the movie is a bit drag and feels like the director had to try real hard to put things together to make some sense (which totally did not) and after that what the movie offers in the second hour is not all that great to have waited 1 hour to get to that.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"This is a modern world ""EPIC""...!!","The fans of the franchise now, have another reason to smile, this time an even bigger one!! :-)Ever since the trailer of The Avengers went on air, from that very day I had been watching it daily twice at least. Already knowing that its got to be a fantastic film...somewhere I feared that hype often kills it!!Thank God!! Nothing like that happened...instead, I, after finally having watched the awesome Superhero flick, feel that this one was under hyped!!!Its a waayyyyyy tooo goooooddd!!!!! One of the best kick-ass action flicks EVER!F***!!! I don't have words enough to describe the excitement I'm in right now. Brilliant it is! Anyone who has ever read any Superhero comic book in his life, GO SEE the movie...Having dazzling set designs all amazingly well crafted into one package, director Joss Whedon to my amazement has given this Superhero feast, a nice new treatment. And that is that The Avengers despite having been put into Genres like Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi, surprise, surprise, it is Extremely funny too...I knew Tony Stark(aka Iron Man) would be delivering some witty lines here and there, but never was I expecting it to be sooo hilarious!! Amazing work!!6 Superheroes, the earth to save, It has EVERYTHING a fan-boy would ever ask for, even more!!After having successfully introduced us to Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America in their individual ventures, Marvel studios have done a brilliantly good job by developing this unbelievable spectacle!!One more thing that I would specially appreciate about The Avengers is that EVERY superhero gets his/her deserving screen space! Nobody was overshadowing.Iron Man is techy, Hulk is destructive, Thor being a Demi-god it must have been a really difficult task to group them up along with Black Widow, Hawkeye and Captain America who are already used to obeying orders. Plus with all that being in place initially they had their egos clashing against one another. Having all that resolved, the enemy is Loki, brother of Thor, there were Supernatural creatures that had to be blended within the perimeters of the world that had been developed. Man, this would have been one hell of a tough job!!Spectacular, jaw dropping action, excellent fun, smart and witty dialogues make this Superhero extravaganza a treat to watch!! Exceeds all expectations.I'm still working on believing it! It was that good... And well, I don't know if I should tell this in public but I, literally was sitting on the seat like a little child, clapping, whistling and laughing my lungs out, enjoying every scene of the movie.There is sooo much to write about but that would be unnecessary i guess, so only one suggestion in the end.....Don't miss this!!This definitely couldn't be any better. Hats off to Joss Whedon, the cast who delivered their performances with a panache and to the Marvel crew!!!This was by far the most entertaining memorable movie I have seen in my life!!

Much Ado About Nothing?,"In late 1930's, when people were huddling in queues to see Scarlet O'Hara being declined by charming Rhett Butler, a rather unknown pulp magazine publisher, Martin Goodman, founded the company named Timely Publications. It started to publish Marvel Comics which was an instant success and over the years a small company evolved into a huge corporation worth billions of dollars. Now the work of more than 70 years is crowned with the latest product – movie of colossal proportions, designated to be a box-office hit.More than 200 million dollars gross on the opening weekend, already over 1 billion dollars gross worldwide, 8.7 rating on IMDb.com and 242 (out of 260) fresh reviews at rottentomatoes.com – those are only some of the astonishing numbers that surround Marvel's The Avengers. It's a dream-come-true movie for the comic book lovers which finally unites most of the greatest super-heroes created by Marvel. It is no surprise that this picture is breaking box-office records, on the other hand, its high IMDb.com rating and universal critical acclaim are unexpected and force to treat The Avengers as a serious film and not as another Michael Bay movie. Those were the standards that I used in order to assess the feature.First of all, I must point out that the story is very conventional and lacks boldness. It is a bit ironic because the movie shows us a bunch of courageous heroes and one of the main values that The Avengers highlights is bravery however its creators rely on a simple and time-tested plot formula. The movie begins with the presentation of the threat when we meet a dramatized villain. Our superheroes struggle to defeat the villain because of the lack of team work. During the movie their personality disorders are probed and eventually overcome, they learn to work together and finally win the battle thanks to a heroic act of the main superhero. It is funny because there are tons of other movies that would fit to this generalized plot summary and most of them are better examples of making money rather than good movies.As if that would be not enough, the feature is stuffed with unoriginal ideas and tasteless jokes designed for the American audience. The villain Loki (Tom Hiddleston) - god from the Norse mythology, shares the basic ideas (and he does not have much of them) with all of the greatest threats of the USA enemies (real or fictive) starting from the commies and finishing with the latest ones including S. Hussein, M. Gaddafi and the whole North Korea. Those ideas are the enslavement of human beings, cruelty towards them and basic misanthropy. I can only imagine how fellow Americans rage when dreadful Loki declares that humanity craves for subjugation. And his method of achieving the success is even more banal, yes, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking about the divide et impera principle. Hey, if it worked for Caesar and Napoleon why shouldn't it work for Loki?! That bastard (actually in one scene Loki's brother Thor (Chris Hemsworth) reveals in another tasteless joke that our mighty villain is adopted so this is not just a disproportionate cursing) has stolen everything! Speaking about jokes, as I already mentioned, most of them are not very new. They range from the standard laughing at someone enduring the pain to laughs triggered by villain's failure. For the sake of truth, I should say that there are some amusing characters like Captain America (Chris Evans and his ""Ma'am, there's only one God, and I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that"") or agent Phil Coulson (and his laughable passion for the Captain America and his cheesy dying scene) but I am not sure if they were supposed to be amusing in a way that they were.On the other hand, the movie is not a total failure and has its moments. Firstly, Robert Downey (as Tony Stark/Iron Man) and Mark Ruffalo (as Bruce Banner/The Hulk) do a great job, giving their characters depth. Tony Stark's wit and charm (""JARVIS, you a fan of Jonah?"") helps to make a likable character that seems to be really created and not borrowed from some stereotype. Bruce Banner, on the contrary, is a shy guy who is ashamed of his alter ego and there can be seen a certain sadness in his eyes every time we see him (though, I still think, that making him a doctor in an Indian slum was a standard Marvel's overreach). Another plus of the movie is its visualization. CGI really looks great and I can clearly see where the movie budget went. Fighting scenes, although I find them painfully long, are nicely done. It is a pleasant experience – seeing it at the theater. However, the same can be said about The TransformersTo sum up, The Avengers is clearly not a movie which I would rate highly for its content and lasting legacy. I do not believe that there is much originality in this flick and it certainly does not raise the bar for comic book movies because there simply are better movies in this category (we all know what I am talking about). However, it still is a decent form of entertainment and its visual aspect should not be forgotten. So if you have not seen it I should suggest to approach it with caution and if you did see it, well, I suggest waiting for another Avengers movie and we will try again to look through the debris of gigantism in search of dramatic life.2012-05-17",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A once in a lifetime movie,"Avengers is a great movie with awesome action, and a story that is simple enough to follow. It doesn't matter if you have seen earlier MARVEL movies or not, although if you have seen them it will provide great character depth. Each character gets its own moments - both physically and emotionally, but quick witted on liners by Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.) and awesome action pieces by Hulk steals the show. Loki(Tom Hiddleston) has his moments to as major super villain. The movie has humor, and all in the right places. The screenplay, dialogues and dialogue delivery is very good and action pieces are the kind that you have never scene before, especially in last half hour.This movie is EPIC.In short, it a movie that you should not miss and if you do you will regret it later.

Teamed up against Evil,"I still remember a while ago when I used to dream about seeing a group of super heroes teamed up against some evil engulfing the earth. Well, I guess it didn't take that long, just because I usually refuse to stop living until my dreams come true. So when that day comes, I will have the feeling I didn't have to wait my whole life for it.""The Avengers"" are here and, I must say, it's a wild ride into the fantastic world. Maybe the team is not made out of my favorite super heroes, but they do come along just fine, supported by amazing special effects that, like so many, turn the impossible into reality, at least on the big screen. This movie is quite a lot of fun, especially if you like action. It's a roller coaster from beginning till the end and the story is not too shabby, either. But I do believe Tony Stark delves more and more into that self absorbing personality of his, driving me a bit nuts. As for the others, they care for the action as much and, not to be too demanding, I must admit I did enjoy the journey. Check it out.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Over rated mind numbing boredom,"With most movies I dislike I can see why others might like them. This is a movie that I honest to god can't see why anybody likes it. It's dumb, the characters are bland, the story is in consistent, and to put it bluntly I was board for the entire film. I was tapping my foot waiting for it to just end. Maybe I just don't like this movie for subjective reasons but none the less this movie just feels like it put everything that was kinda cool in other superhero movies into a blender and hit mix.4/10",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Sequel coming you say???......umm, YES PLEASE!","Lets face it...I'm writing this ""review"" 6/15/12 and if you haven't seen the movie by now, then odds are you aren't planning on doing so! Just saying.That being said, I'm not one to post spoilers, so a general review will be given.Actually, I probably could sum it up in one statement:THE HULK FRICKING OWNED THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!Yes; Thor, Ironman, Captain America (helllooooo sexy!), Hawkeye, and Black Widow all had their shining moments (which is another layer of awesomeness to the film), but anyone who watched it would more than likely agree that although the big green guy was not in many scenes, he still managed to OWN this movie!The energy of the movie is absolutely amazing and I personally cant wait until the sequel!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A spectacular spectacular!,"I just got back from the movie theater where I saw The Avengers. Without spoiling anything, I must say it is indeed a spectacular spectacular and I hope to find time to watch it again in the near future. It's an action bonanza laced with fine performances (I love the arguments between Captain America and Iron Man cleverly delivered by Chris Evans and Robert Downey, Jr.), clever humor and not surprisingly Marvel universe references.Anyone who is a comic reader or a Marvel universe fan will notice lots of fine details on the characters, the plot and the images. Even with the daunting challenge of presenting The Avengers as an entertaining all-star gathering, director Joss Whedon cleverly told the story while utilizing the fine talents of the stars. The script was nicely done and the dialogue really reflect the minds of each character. Really, The Avengers is the complete package of entertainment that engaged me with lots of thrills and absolutely no boring moments. I highly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A very very good movie,"The Avengers is really fun, because you see everyone together. Idk what to say just than that is good.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Avengers!,"I would like to preface any comments i have regarding this movie with a confession, i never thought The Avengers Assemble would ever happen. Even when Marvel started to weave the characters and films together (rather cock handedly i thought) i still felt it would be a step too far. The main problem (or so i thought) would be to balance the characters and actors. Indeed, the very thought of Robert Downey Jnr, Edward Norton (replaced here by the excellent Mark Ruffalo), Chris Evans and Samuel L Jackson in the same film is enough to melt even the hardened film fans little heart. This perceived problem is definitely the films major strength, the way Joss Whedon (finally getting his props) allows each character their space to shine whilst adhering to the 'confines' of the super group is exemplary. None of the team are ever neglected, no matter how varied or relative their strengths seem to be. The obvious odd men out here, Hawkeye and Black Widow, get just as much screen time both kicking ass and burping exposition as Stark or Banner do. Its this care and attention that gives the movie its weight, that even when we are watching a 20 minute slew of explosions and flying kicks, we are still pondering the fragile dynamics of the group.The action sequences, although never particularly groundbreaking, are never the less brilliant. Probably the shining light is the emergence of the Hulk. The Hulk has had a checkered cinematic past and its nice to see him finally get the treatment he deserves. Firstly, we get the fragile, brilliant and a little kooky Dr Banner. We are inundated with references to his dangerous 'other self', which serves to amp up excitement for the eventual breakout of Banners monstrous alter ego. We really get a sense of how dangerous The Hulk is, everyone on the team seems all to aware of his power none more so than Banner himself. Watching The Hulk single handedly take down one of the larger shark-like alien spacecrafts was utterly beguiling and left me reeling with excitement. The bench mark for marrying visual effects and emotion in this type of movie was Spiderman 2, to my mind at least. It was the perfect balance between caring for Peter Parker and believing in the power of his alter ego. That's exactly what we get in spades here, whether its watching Thor whipping up a storm, Iron Man deploying his TnT or Captain America wielding his starry shield.Another particular strength is the films humour. Since Batman Begins we have been told that movies have to be darker, edgier and more realistic and whilst i love Batman Begins (and its sequel) i am growing tired of the trend. Here we have a movie that is peppered with fragrant, wholesome humour. Most of this is supplied by everyones favourite smart arse Tony Stark, his witty one liners prop up some of the more lengthy expository scenes and give them a welcoming zip. Also present is Whedons own brand of silly visual comedy which he honed on Buffy The Vampire Slayer. A few scenes continue past the usual action or emotional beat to great comedic effect, for example, after watching Hulk and Thor beat on a few faceless baddies we watch as they recover, the scene should end there but Whedon has us stay around just long enough to see Hulk knock Thor across the room with a single punch. The moment is simple but so effective, it breaks up any monotony accumulated in the drawn out action sequences, breathing fresh air into the proceedings.Everyone (without exception) comes out of the film with their heads held high, even Scarlett Johansson impressed me as the manipulative Russian spy (Black Widow) and that is something i never thought i would say. I hear the argument that all the actors represented here aren't doing anything taxing or game changing but no matter how frivolous the entertainment may be it still takes some craft to make the world believable. Its Mark Ruffalo that steals the show as the tetchy Bruce Banner. It might be down to the unique fact that we have seen a few incarnations of this particular character over the years and therefore have a solid reference point(s) in which to examine Ruffalo's performance. Its his awkwardness that is the key to this performance, we had always seen Bruce as a gifted but tortured soul. Here Ruffalo plays it smoother, we get a man who is seemingly confident, articulate but broken it seems then, that he is always one step from the Hulk (as he states a one point in the film). The Hulk element isn't portrayed so much as an accident (as in previous incarnations) but as a dangerous personality trait of Banner himself. This is a much more allegorical reading of the character and a much more intelligent one. It is far too easy to write him off as an experiment gone wrong and ditch him as such. Banner learns to control his inner demon and tries to follow the path of the righteous man, well, as much as he can anyway.This film easily represents the most satisfying instalment of the super hero movie genre. That's not to say its the quintessential super hero movie, but its the most watchable and enjoyable movie of its kind. It doesn't have The Dark Knight's brooding intellect nor does it have Watchemens genre critique but what it does have is fun. I couldn't believe leaving the cinema that the film was a whopping 2hrs 20minutes long, this is testament to the scripts strength and the films charm and charisma. Judging by the films opening box office receipts, i don't think i need to urge anybody to go see this movie but if its simple, loud fun you want you absolutely, positively cant go wrong with The Avengers Assemble.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fantastic superhero movie - best from Marvel in years!,"Initially when I first saw the trailer I was a bit reluctant about this flick – I thought it would be another good, but average superhero movie. After watching it, however, I just had to admit: this was one of the best action movies I've seen in years.The story is a simple as that: Locki returns with his obsession of being a 'beloved' king and along with his army decides to dominate Earth. Then, Nick Fury makes a union with Iron Man, Hulk, Thor and Captain America (The Avengers) to save our planet.Reading this synopsis may make you think this is a silly movie, but it is because of this simplicity that 'The Avengers' is so good. The story just gets direct to the point without hesitation and involves the audience since the beginning. There is also some laughing moment between the action scenes – which I felt was great. Just to break the ice – Iron Man with his sardonic jokes.Another aspect I felt while watching it was how it was made to be unpretentious, but fun and entertaining. I have noticed that some recent Hollywood movies have been failing on these points – I mean, sometimes they try to make action films so 'complex' and serious – but why complicate it? We are just looking forward a nice film to relax and enjoy the time and 'The Avengers' provides it easily – at least for me it did.Then, mix all these aspects with a lot of explosions – yes, they destroyed Manhattan again! – astounding visual effects and a great cast (this time we have the best Hulk ever with Mark Ruffalo). The result: fantastic superhero movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very Typical,"I wouldn't recommend it to a friend but I wouldn't try to persuade them not to see it either. I usually find IMDb ratings fairly accurate. The Current rating of 8.9 suggests this movie will be something special. Unfortunately all I saw was something very typical, very Hollywood and very predictable. As more people vote and the hype dies down this movies rating will fall below 8.Don't get me wrong, you will be entertained if you watch it.. The special effects are ... well.. Special. There are even several instances where you will laugh out loud. There are some genuinely funny parts that I wasn't expecting.The problem is the story line is very unoriginal and you're never gripped by what is unfolding. Think transformers. There are just too many clichés, and many instances where things are simply not plausible, even for superheroes. I know it's not meant to be realistic but you will be muttering under your breath ""yeah bull ___ "" at some of the outrageously unlikely feats. Ironman's mid-air ship repair is one particularly bad scene you should watch out for.The acting was acceptable given the script they were working with. It's hard to deliver a line well when it's a god awful cliché. It's the kind of thing where the actor just about looks at the camera and says ""Let's get these guys!"" or ""you're going to pay for that!""It sounds like an overly negative review but that has a lot to do with my expectations given the IMDb rating. See it if you want some thoughtless entertainment. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Avengers (2012),"It's finally here. OH MY GOD. As a big comic fan it's amazing to see how far the genre has come in the last decade. We finally get star studded spin-off featuring a large cast of some of the greatest characters. If you've been living under a rock, then you may not have noticed that over the last five years, Marvel have been churning out their big hitters and building up to The Avengers. Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and Hulk join forces to stop Thor's brother, Loki and his alien army. Sure, the plot is simple, but that's what we want for a big smackdown. For any team we need a great leader and Marvel have found the best in Joss Whedon. With his familiarity with large ensembles he effortlessly gives every hero their due. He also manages to flesh out characters in very short scenes. We get a sense of Stark and Potts relationship, some back story for Black Widow and Hawkeye, the confusion of Rogers and so forth. He does his best work with Hulk. I've loved every incarnation of the Hulk so far, so I was wary of Ruffalo's performance. He captures it perfectly, going for a more nervous and geeky Banner. When the Hulk is unleashed, Whedon makes sure to not take it too seriously. Hulk gets the biggest laughs in this surprisingly comic film. The action is fantastic, with a number of exciting set pieces. The final battle has so many wonderful character moments immersed in the action, and they really do work as a team. There are a couple of shortcomings. The alien race is just pathetic, and never really feels like a threat. Add to that the whole mother ship destroyed and every alien dies plot convenience. The film lacks any real threat. We hear about the many people Loki kills, but we never see anything that relates to this. Without seeing the sacrifices made it's hard to get too involved. There are also a few moments where characters just happen to show up. These are things that are minor nitpicks. After all, the only way to do a perfect Avengers movie would be to have an unlimited budget and unlimited running time. What it does achieve is simply amazing and very exciting for the future of superhero films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A great ending of phase 1!,"#MCUrewatch. Back in 2012 this was a big thing: after their individual films Iron Man, Hulk, Thor and Captain America (together with two top assassins) team up to battle Loki and an entire army of aliens. Now we know this was just the beginning of the MCU. It is still one of the stronger films of the franchise out there. The chemistry between those characters/actors works magic. And it is the fun in seeing them both verbally and physically fighting with each other that is the Ace of the MCU and it pretty much started here. It still misses the gravitas some of the later films have (the Coulson drama doesn't really hit off that well). The action is solid and still fresh (back in '12 it was still unique when an entire city was destroyed through superhero fighting). Oh it also features the best turn of Hiddlestone as Loki. All in all still one of the best entrances in the MCU.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A fantastic Marvel adventure,"I've always watched Marvel films but I've never been the greatest fan of them. I find them entertaining but they are often similar and rarely deliver quite such the memorable and action-packed experience that 'Avengers Assemble' offers. Seriously, whether you are a Marvel fan or not, give this film a chance, it may very well surprise you.I can't think of any particularly large faults to this movie that are worth mentioning, the plot isn't exactly unique but that's not what I saw as the purpose of the film. The film's plot tied together the previous Marvel films featuring heroes such as Iron Man and Captain America very well, it then went on to set up and deliver a roller coaster ride of sci-fi action unlike anything I've ever seen before in a Marvel film.'Avengers Assemble' certainly beats the previous films in terms of CGI, action, characters and memorability. From the opinions of friends, I know that the film has even appealed to those that aren't directly a fan of sci-fi action. There is certainly something about the film that simply stuns the viewer and impresses them with up-to-date visuals and a fast-paced storyline.A fact worth mentioning is that, unlike previous films, 'Avengers Assemble' doesn't take itself too seriously. It's not a comedy, or a parody, but it does allow for humorous moments that actually made me smile more than some actual comedies have. This allows you to enjoy the film further I feel, rather than taking away the more serious elements.If you haven't seen the film already, make sure to find the time to watch it, it will entertain you in some way or another and is definitely worth at least one viewing. Truly one of the better movies of the past decade.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"It's sort of entertaining, but dramatically uninteresting and shallow.","These Marvel comics obviously have a lot of fans, and apparently whatever it was that fans (and many non-fans) were looking for in a Marvel film was fulfilled here, explaining the huge internet buzz, the vast amounts of money this has made, and it's current spot in the top 50 films of all time on the Internet Movie Database. This movie does have expensive looking action, and some comedic bits with lots of superheroes, but what it's missing is...pretty much everything else. The plot is uninteresting and quite honestly stupid, and nothing really is driving this story along. At times, to me, it grew boring, because there was nothing to get excited about besides action, big stars and comedy.After Norse god Loki steals the powerful potential super weapon ""Tesseract"" from the peace keeping S.H.I.E.L.D. agency, and mind controls a few people, Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) puts together a team of superheroes known as the Avengers, made up of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and eventually Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Loki is in cahoots with a group of aliens called the Chitauri, and plans to help them take over Earth. The Avengers must stop fighting with each other in order to protect the Earth...can they do it, or will the Earth be destroyed? (Take a guess).Director Joss Wheddon, known for his work on television series, does a fine job with the direction when it comes to action. The big action scenes are appropriately frenetic, and they look big and shiny. I appreciated that the action scenes were spaced apart from each other also, as to not overkill the action like the Transformers films. The fighting scenes between the Avengers was a bit overkill however. Half the movie is them disagreeing with each other, or Tony Stark being snarky with everyone. These scenes don't really have anything to them either. They aren't exciting. They are meant to be funny, but oftentimes comes off as more infantile in the humor department than anything else. They further the plot along, only in that the plot cannot proceed until these guys stop fighting. These scenes are supposed to work as character development, but it's almost unbelievable how stupid these guys are, and how unwilling they are to put their differences aside.The middle of the movie takes place on a ship, with the Avengers angry at each other, and this whole section of the movie just meanders. You could say that this part of the movie gives us the character conflicts and whatnot, which it does, but the Avengers' dislike of each other could have been introduced in something more important to the plot, instead of practically stopping the plot to have these guys get angry at each other. And that's really the movie's biggest problem is the plot. There's never really a feeling of dread, or that something bad could happen, and it's hard to care about anything that's happening. That's not to say watching Tony Stark bantering isn't amusing, or watching Bruce Banner go insane as the Hulk isn't interesting, but nothing ever truly feels at stake. When the film decides to kill off a character to add some level of emotion, and serve as a reason for these heroes to stop their childishness, it doesn't work on an emotional level. It comes off as a cheap way to further along the plot.The Avengers has some good elements to it. It's got a lot of charisma in the cast, and each character is given enough screen time I suppose. The action scenes are satisfying mostly, and some of the comedy isn't bad (while some does come off as a bit corny and pandering to the audience). The problem is the plot, where the villains never really come off as menacing, despite possessing a super weapon, and a main villain is Loki who is about as threatening as a teddy bear. There's nothing to the film, and nothing to really love about it, unless you are a big fan of these actors, the comics, or explosions. There's very little below the surface of the film, and without a good plot to move this along, we've essentially got one long Avengers origin story. Apparently many have fallen in love with this though, so if you like your movies big, dumb and full of buff dudes, you'll probably like this one quite a bit.My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 140 mins. PG-13 for action violence.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Ultimate SuperHero Film,"It took Iron Man, Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, and Captain America to build up to this, and was it worth the wait, Yes in deed.Nick Fury(Samual L. Jackson) brings together Captain America(Chris Evans), Iron Man(Robert Doney Jr), Thor(Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk(Mark Rufalo), Black Widow(Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye(Jeremy Renner) in hopes of stopping Loki(Tom Hiddleston) from world domination.It was worth it all the way through. Samual L. Jackson this time is front and center, and really shines in the role of Nick Fury. So does everybody else, Mark Rufalo really brings his own to Bruce Banner, although I do miss Edward Norton in the role, Rufalo does quite well. And Tom Hiddleston is quite menacing as Loki, more so then he was in Thor(2011), he was the best villain, almost tops The Joker. The rest of the cast are pretty good also.

Action-scenes are good, dialog can be fun sometimes and the acting is nice. It just brings nothing new to the table and it is one of those movies, that you will watch and then remember a couple of scenes/lines from it and later on, you'll just remember a warm fuzzy feeling that it left in you.

Greatest action film I've seen,"There are not many films that are good enough (In my opinion) to make me go and see it five times at the cinemas, HOWEVER from start to finish The Avengers was an excellent example of how to develop a reasonably detailed plot-line whilst maintaining an unrelenting series of action sequences.The chemistry between each of the already well established characters was fantastic. Getting a good balance of all personalities with wholesome and righteous from Captain America, sarcastic and nonchalant from Iron Man, zen and rage from Bruce Banner. They really managed to cover all the sides of human emotion and hero stereotypes.At the end of the day if you want the most unexpected, ground shattering storyline with serious real-life connections tho may not be the best movie for you. However if you want a brilliantly laid out series of action sequence, funny one liner, small plot development, action sequence, action sequence and bigger action sequence.

No Fun for a Non-Fan,"As someone who has not read Marvel comics, has not seen the films ""Captain America,"" ""The Hulk,"" ""Thor,"" or ""Iron Man II,"" this film failed to pull me in. As a standalone movie, ""The Avengers"" feels like a mishmash of rapid surface-level character introduction and way too much action. Little attention is given to character development, as it seems viewers are expected to come into the film with a degree of knowledge.However, this is not to say that I think the film would be great if I did have some knowledge of the backstory. There's little in the way of a moral here or a deeper meaning, as this is just a good-GUY-saves-world plot. It's one that (like many superhero movies before) makes me ask if character development or THOUGHT, for that matter, really are being extinguished by money-driven action. I wouldn't even call this a ""popcorn movie,"" as I found few laughs and absolutely no connection to the characters in my experience.I like action movies, but I need to be drawn in to the characters in order to CARE about the action. ""The Avengers"" didn't even try to draw me in, it just said ""here are the heroes, now watch them fight!"" If the first hour had established some human element for the heroes, I might have liked the action. As it stands, the audience is thrown into the arena with the invincible combatants, and expected to immediately feel for them despite their inherent invincibility. I must ask - why should I care about action when one side can't lose and I haven't been told otherwise? Why should I root for the Yankees? (The only reason I can see is because the ""bad guy"" Loki wears a ridiculous looking costume).I keep attempting to find redemption in society's reception of this movie. Maybe that's why I hope that I'm just missing a big part of the backstory. I'm a big Whedon fan, and came into ""The Avengers"" hoping to see some more of his magic. I was rewarded with a two-and-a-half hour snooze fest of CG action. My only sincere hope is that the millions he makes off of this movie funds ""real"" projects of his in the future.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Everything that's happening, the things that are about to come to light, people might just need a little old fashioned.","The Avengers (AKA: Avengers Assemble) is written and directed by Joss Whedon, with Zak Penn co-writing the story. It stars Robert Downey Junior, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddlestone, Clark Gregg, Samuel L. Jackson, Cobie Smulders and Stellan Skarsgard. Music is scored by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Seamus McGarvey.Asgardian outcast Loki (Hiddlestone) has struck a deal with the Chitauri to exchange the Tesseract for an army with which he can attack Earth and thus control it. With the Earth in mortal danger, S.H.I.E.L.D director Nick Fury (Jackson) activates the Avengers Initiative; a collection of super heroes and deadly assassins who, if they can actually come together as one united force, hold the fate of the Earth in their hands.I have no real frame of reference with The Avengers comic book world, when I was young I read a bit of Spidey, Batman and was kind of partial to The Fantastic Four, but I really don't remember story lines and gave up reading that sort of stuff once sport and exams came into my life. I love movies and as I enter the later stages of my forties I'm pleased to say I have a wide range of film genre interests. I have very much enjoyed The Avengers solo films so far, with the exception of Iron Man 2 which quite frankly is average at best, but the reality is that if The Avengers failed as a movie, that Whedon got it so wrong, then I wouldn't be foaming at the mouth or proclaiming that the director be stripped naked and whipped around the streets of Hollywood! As it is, with one or two minor irks aside, The Avengers is about as much fun as I have had with a movie in quite a few years.I wouldn't know if the makers got the essence right, or if the story is at one in the Marvel Avengers Universe, I just know that it is a right old blast and made a colossal amount of money at the box office, even trumping The Dark Knight Rises in that department. It's a film full of derring-do heroics, ripe witticisms, wonderfully staged action, simmering sexual tensions, ego collisions, charm, heart and splendid human interactions. It looks fabulous on Blu-ray, the art design, the colour photography and Silvestri's score rumbles like thunder and crackles like lightning, just as a super hero movie score should do. The cast performances are hugely enjoyable as they bounce off of one and other, feeding off the respective thespian energy with a knowing of the right tone to make this colourful comic book world be all that it can be. While Whedon, with a weight of expectation akin to Atlas holding the World on his shoulders, comes through with flying colours with astute pacing and an impressive marshaling of an acting army.Flaws? Jackson's Nick Fury could have done with more screen time and Cobie Smulders is sadly short changed as well. The Chitauri are only really a threat because of their sheer numbers, not because of any great alien design, and, well, The Hulk CGI hasn't really advanced much from the 2008 version, but really these are small itches rather than big ones. Is The Avengers the best film of 2012? It will be seen as such for many fans of the source(s) who have waited with baited breath for this coming together of their heroes, and that notion really shouldn't irk the more highbrow film fans out there. Me? No it isn't the best film of 2012, but as I found my self perched on the edge of my seat as the finale unfurls in a wave of explosive heroic energy, and I caressed my ribs from laughing out loud, I knew then that undoubtedly The Avengers is the most fun film of 2012. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Joss Whedon as Director put tingles down my spine as I am a major Buffy and Angel fan in addition to him writing the greatest X Men Story of all time (Astonishing X Men) I knew we was in excellent hands!If there are 2 minor criticms of this movie it would be these: 1: Maria Hill by Cobie Smulders... Im a major fan of HIMYM and her character Robin Schebatsky and miss smulders is a major crush of mine however they made Maria Hill into your carbon copy standard issue agent!

On the nail,"What can I say- I grew up with these guys in the 70's - being an English boy it was not so common to be reading these comics at 10 rather than Whizzer and Chips; et al, but I always loved Marvel for being more ""real"" (yeh I Know - these are Superheroes were talking about, I did stop collecting them by the time I was an adult - but yeh - I still got them all!).It was a childhood dream to imagine seeing these characters in a film, but film attempts were always so lame until CGI took hold.The X-Men (1 & 2 & 1st Class,) Spiderman (1,2 and, yes 3) Iron Man & Thor films finally met my childhood expectations. The Avengers has been the icing on the cake. The only disappointment for me is: Where are Janet, Hank, Wanda, Pietro & The Vision... patience!

Avengers...3 out of 4 Skittles,"You can sum up Avengers in one wordFUN. Some of the world's greatest comic book characters all together in one movie, kicking ass to save us puny humanswho wouldn't want to see that? And as great as it is to see the Avengers come together to save the world, some of the most fun is had when they butt heads and pound on each other just like in the comics. Iron Man vs. Thor, Thor vs. Hulk, Iron Man vs. Captain America.great stuff.Director Joss Whedon does a solid job showcasing all the Avengers without forcing too much story into one movie. Rounding out the individual superhero movies that have been leading up to this was no easy challenge. From Jon Favereau's good Iron Man movies, to the marginal Captain America, and the abysmal Thor pic. Whedon molds the good and bad that he had to work with from the past stories and made an entertaining film.I'm not so sure I would crown The Avengers as the top comic book movie of all time (which is currently still The Dark Knight in my mind), but it was a blast seeing all the Marvel characters finally uniting in the same movie. I can only hope that all the movies this blockbuster season are this much fun.For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"I'm a satisfied Avengers fan, although find it hard to overlook the flaws.","I'm writing this review from the perspective of an avid comic book collector, and Avengers fan.I absolutely loved the action in this film, from every one of the main characters. They fought like they do in the comic books, especially Captain America. It seems as if he had plenty of time to practice with that shield of his, the choreography of his fight scenes were better, and he showed the agility and super strength this time out. Chris Evans was very solid in portraying him, and acted like a true captain. Very authoritative.Even Thor used his hammer to its full capacity, making the most out of it. He used it to absorb and block kinetic energy, dish out energy in return, and he just felt more powerful than he did in his introductory film. He was a bit too serious in the film, gone was that positive attitude though.Iron man was his usual self, mostly there for comedic elements. Sometimes, it took away from the solemn tone of the action scenes, there were just too many jokes in the heat of battle and found it hard to laugh at times during his jokes. One thing I loved about his fighting scenes was how he used Captain America's shield to deflect his beams. So, so cool. Well choreographed! Now, the Hulk. In a nutshell, well, he stole the show! That's all I'm going to say. He looked so much better then he did in his film just several years ago, my how technology progresses in such short time! Now, the supporting cast did OK, Black Widow got more screen time then I expected. She is fun to watch, a great tough actress Johansson is. As is Renner, too bad he was limited in his action. I won't mention the other performances by Paltrow, Jackson and Skaarsgards...they were all just solid and short.Plotwise, well, nothing that complicated. It was a sublime story, but simple when looked above the surface. Aliens invade through a Stargate/Wormhole. Dark and evil energy is brought forth by the main Protagonist, who was fantastic as usual. Hiddlestone was just as menacing as he was in Thor, a fine actor indeed. Acting wise, he stole the show, and threatened mentally more than physically. That is rare in a Marvel film.Now, if a Marvel film would only have a top name directing it. I mean, DC movies get the best directors, Donner, Burton, Snyder, and Nolan. Am I missing one? The Avengers felt too confusing at times, a comedy for the most part, yet, having the violence and action of a war film. I didn't like that. And as for the 8.8 score and fantastic reviews, well, I can't rate a movie above an 7 if its missing a good soundtrack. Perhaps less CGI and a good composer would add more emotion to the film. I found that The Avengers lacked in emotive substance.Go see it though, it's a hell of a roller coaster ride and one of the best comic book adaptations ever.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Loud, Long, 110% Special Effects","Has the global situation grown so bleak that the populace has regressed to comic books for escapism entertainment? Judging by the enormous popularity of everything cinematic based on superheroes and sci-fi extravaganzas I suppose the answer is 'Yes!' To sit in one place for an excess of 2 ½ hours and witness the destruction derby that is the apocalyptic bad guys (in the form of a light spear carrying Loki (Tom Hiddleston) against Samuel L. Jackson's SHIELD cast of make-believe folks - Robert Downey, Jr in armor, Chris Evans in his Captain America Halloween costume, Mark Ruffalo unconvincingly transforming into the Hulk, Chris Hemsworth as hammer wielding Thor, Scarlett Johansson as a pretty Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye all out to make life sustainable for the leasers like Stellan Skarsgård, Clark Gregg, and Colbie Smulders - is a feat in itself.For movies of this type this one has more color and imaginative loco devices that most and therefore I suppose it remains at the top of the heap. When will these characters run out of tales? The answer likely is 'When the movie public stops ling up for these epics.'Grady Harp",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Definitely A Masterpiece by Joss Whedon,"This is one of the most awaited movies of all time - and for the legions of fans in Asia, the wait is going to be over soon. For those who have not yet booked their tickets, I suggest that they do so, preferably at the IMAX cineplex where the action in 3D can be overwhelming.I must say I was a bit skeptical that writer-director Joss Whedon (creator of TV's ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel"") can pull off this six-in-one superhero flick. Will it be like assembling six major egos in a small room - and cramming their style? With the plot of 'six against one (Loki)', wouldn't that be overkill and unfair advantage? Will the storyline/plot measure up to the CGI and effects that take up a major part of its US$220 million budget? Will this Disney effort follow in the heels of John Carter and go downhill? All these doubts are dashed after 20 minutes into the movie - when we find Earth being threatened by demi-god Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the head of S.H.I.E.L.D (for Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division) starts The Avenger Initiative. From here on, it is pure, Marvelous fanboy entertainment of the supreme order! You can bet this one is going to put Whedon among the ranks of top directors like Spielberg and Cameron.Those who have seen Captain America last year may remember the Tesseract, the all-powerful energy cube found at the bottom of the ocean. Loki, the megalomaniacal brother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) manages to get his hands on it and plans to use it to summon his army of outer space warriors to take over the world.To stop him, Fury and his assistant Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) assemble the various 'superheroes' on his massive 'helicarrier' in preparation for war against Loki's forces. These include Steve Rogers' Captain America (Chris Evans), Tony Stark's Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Dr Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Thor. Special agent Clint Barton, or Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) makes up the sixth member a bit later when Manhattan is being bombarded by outer space monsters.The climactic battle takes up almost all of the final half-hour but the whole movie is absorbing enough, thanks to a cleverly written script that incorporates a fine balance of sincerity and self-effacing wit. Indeed, before the Avengers battle the alien invaders, they fight one another, both physically and verbally. Like, Iron Man's quips when he first meets Thor: ""What's this, Shakespeare in the park?"" and ""Does your mother know you're wearing her drapes?"" Indeed, the punchlines are more powerful - and memorable - than the real punches.Whedon does not waste time re-introducing his characters. We are already familiar with Iron Man, Captain America and Thor. The physical talents of Scar-Jo's Black Widow are 'introduced' in an interrogation scene where she later beats the brains out of her interrogators while she puts her boss Agent Coulson on hold.I have always wondered how Mark Ruffalo will fare as the Hulk - and I am surprised he almost ran away with the show. His Dr Banner is a mellow guy hiding out in India before being 'persuaded' by Natasha to join The Avengers. On board Fury's helicarrier, we can see him doing his utmost to keep his temper in check - ""you must have been doing a lot of yoga"" someone jokes. And yes, when The Hulk emerges, it is really Incredible. Also watch out for Marvel Comics' Stan Lee who gets a self-effacing one-liner during the action scenes.One of the 'misses' of this film is that Natalie Portman's Jane is left out of Thor's story - except for a picture. This is in contrast to Stark's relationship with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) which takes up quite a few scenes. And even though he has to face-off against six superheroes, Hiddleston's Loki is formidable and menacing enough as the arch villain. Of course, Jackson finally has a proper role here after cameos in the previous Iron Man and Captain America films.It really isn't about whether you're going to catch ""The Avengers""; it's how many times you will want to see it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An amazing symphony of perfectly intertwined moving parts.,"I'm not the biggest fan of the setup movies for The Avengers. I think they're tremendously hit and miss, and not through some comic book fan need for accuracy but as stand alone films on their own merits. See, I like the odd comic book, but I'm certainly not a comic book fan. What I am a fan of is good, solid storytelling. You know - characters that evolve, logically sound motivations and tensions, good pacing, an antagonist defeated through skill rather than luck - that sort of thing. From this perspective, the setup movies fell mostly flat for me. Iron Man was fabulous fun but it's sequel was poor. The Hulk was meh. Captain America spent far too long without any actual Captain America in it, and Thor - hmmm was just a bit of an all round mess and lacked even eye candy set pieces to elevate it.So back a few years ago when it first became whispered in nerd circles that The Avengers was going to surface to tie all these movies together, I didn't really get much of a sense of excitement. A few years later, as the end credits rolled on Thor, I pretty much made up my mind that The Avengers movie was going to screw up badly. If the industry couldn't pull off a good movie with just one hero in it, how could they ever pull off one with six?Then I heard that Joss Whedon was writing and directing and my interest rekindled. After all, I've seen him handle symphonies of characters before - with the Scooby Gang and the Serenity crew. If anyone could do it, Whedon could.But still I was wary. Just didn't want to let my expectations get too high - superhero movies are notoriously difficult to get right after all. Maybe even Whedon would screw it up.Boy was I wrong.I don't think I've had this much fun at the cinema in years. Since the first Matrix movie in fact which was, what? Twelve years ago? (God I'm old). The Avengers had everything a good popcorn flick needs - major action setpieces, beautiful sfx, some neat and effective humor, yada yada yada. But none of that is what left my jaw on the floor. What really blew me away - and what compelled me to come here and write the first review I've done on IMDb in quite some time (years probably) - was just how perfectly done the script was. Every character is given their moment to shine, every interaction is perfectly in tune, this whole movie was the audiovisual equivalent of listening to a perfectly wrought symphony. Every moving part clicked into place so well that you couldn't have taken out one single character - not even the arguably 'second tier' characters of Hawkeye and the Black Widow - without the whole thing coming apart.This is no Batman or Pirates of the Caribbean, or Spider Man movie; because while those multi-protagonist movies were all quite adequate and entertaining, the characters and plots were often an out of focus mess. Not so in The Avengers. Everything clicks so perfectly I can't even find the words to describe it. You'll just have to go see it for yourself to see what I mean.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Must see!,"I am a fan of the recent Marvel superhero movies. Spiderman, Iron Man, The Hulk, Thor, and especially Captain America. The Avengers is better than all of those. All of the heroes in The Avengers get a moment to shine on screen, even Nick Fury. Going into the movie I was a little disappointed to know that Loki was going to be the main protagonist, but after seeing the film I can see why this was the case. The Avengers ties a lot of the previous movies together, and having Thor's brother as the bad guy made that more efficient. It's a long movie, but when it was over I didn't feel beat up and ready for the story to be over the way I do when trying to watch an entire Harry Potter movie. Even the Lord of the Rings movies seems too long to me, but thanks to a great story and even better dialog I never became impatient during The Avengers.The standout from The Avengers is clearly The Hulk. You spend most of the movie waiting for him to appear and it's amazing when he finally goes on a rampage. At two points during the movie The Hulk actually got applause from the audience.Highly recommended, I can't wait to see it again. Let's hope The Avengers 2 is half as good!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Entertainment to the highest degree!,"I had never been heavily anticipating The Avengers. I'm not a huge fan of any of these superheroes, and haven't been up to date on most of these. I only saw the first Iron Man and the two Hulk films, but honestly nothing Marvel released since then. The Avengers surprised me. It turned out to be a fairly slow-paced film with subtle character dynamics and nuanced performances.Okay, really, it's just a BLAST! Nothing more has to be said. It has a tone that giddily encourages you to get on board. It's pretty much everything you expect, but it doesn't insult your intelligence. In fact, the characters and dialogue are all pretty well-written. A film like this could have had just as amazing action sequences, but with lesser writing and development, wouldn't be nearly as satisfying. Truly, there's something to enjoy in all of these characters, particularly Banner (perfectly portrayed by Ruffalo) and the always charming Tony Stark (Downey Jr.). Having not seen Thor, I enjoyed him a lot too and thought Hemsworth was pretty excellent.Technially, it's excellent. The editing is fantastic, and there is not a single flaw within the editing achievement. Editing action films, especially in their big moments, can be very hard to accomplish, but these filmmakers did an impeccable job. The action sequences are amazing, and big, huge. Overall, there's so much excitement to be had here. I don't have a problem calling The Avengers THE ""perfect summer blockbuster"". It truly is, and boy what a ride it is. Strongly recommended to everyone.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good but also bad,"This was one of those movies I did not feel an urge to watch. I waited until it was shown in the television. I think one will find the movie more enjoyable if one has read some of the comics or know more about the Marvel universe than I. I frankly thought it a bit boring, very nicely made and worth watching, but I have seen better, and the only reason it deserves to be on the top 250 is because of the effects. but even if the effects are very well made, I suppose it also helps make the movie less interesting. just a lot of fighting and flying. it is also as if this movie is not allowed to be serious, always the serious scenes are broken by comedy, sometimes bad humour. That said, it is still worth watching, and it has good scenes and is pretty to watch. But not one I am eager to watch anytime soon again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It is a great movie...,"This many reviews can't be wrong and now I'm part of that group. I won't spoil it with much details but the script is good, the directing is great and the action is just amazing. The biggest surprise for me was Mark Ruffalo's part. I was highly skeptical because of his look and the Hulk's but after seeing the entire movie I have to agree that he is the best Hulk version thus far. I am simply amaze at both Weldon and Mark's work. Just wow.The are two disappointing things for me though. First is Hawkeye. He's only smiles once in the movie and I bet you'll have a hard time finding that part. This is because I've grew up knowing Hawkeye more as a comedic/serious character and not just a pure serious character. That doesn't mean his part in the movie wasn't great. Second is Banner just showing up and agreeing to fight alongside the team. Sure one can make guesses but I much prefer that one was provided; either as Hulk wanting to protect others as he usually does, or as Banner and Hulk agreeing that he needs to help out so that others see him differently and accept him. But even this is overshadowed immediately by the next 10s after he arrives. That was just jaw dropping for me and the Avenger teammates LOL I have to suggest to those that haven't already watched the movie to pay close attention to the dialog's. Many of the lower reviews, especially from film critics, is because they really don't pay attention to the dialog's and rate it down. Plus, you'll see why I enjoyed the Hulk immensely in this movie.Many people are turned off on the fact that it is an alien invasion scene even the so-called hardcore comic fans. I will have to remind everyone here that for most comic superheroes the big, world killer scenarios are from outer space, from aliens. It doesn't matter if it's DC or Marvel, it's exact SAME situation. It's not a copy of Transformers 3 since Michael Bay made up the story in the first place and did a poor job at it. Transformers 3 is a copy of what comic books have been using for ages.Don't be surprise but eventually Superman will have Doomsday and his portals. Green Lantern is guardian of the UNIVERSE, don't see how one gets upset at an Alien force coming in to destroy Earth or any other planet that is in their area of protection. Batman and the Justice League will have their Aliens and so forth. Really, what are you complaining about then? That there are too much Aliens? How are you going to introduce them then and still remain true to the story? That's what I thought. Mindless comic book fans that ""think"" they know better...pffft.If you're happy with just the superhero fighting human villains on and from Earth fine. Stay that way. But don't go bitching because eventually the story of ALL superheroes will involve aliens. You're precious Batman will involve aliens, it's just not there in the form of movies YET. Joker has a big part in aliens and Earth's destruction. Get with it people.As for people complaining about the lack of character development well the answer is simple. Go and watch the respective movies about the super hero you are disappointed about. There are two Iron movies, 2 Hulks, One captain America, One Thor. And while Black Window and Hawkeye don't have their own movie yet they did have a little history in the movie about them. They are the less popular heroes of the team that's why. So again, why are people even complaining about this issue in the first place?Seriously though I sometimes think people are just too anal to think clearly, even hardcore fans.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Went in with very high expectations, and was pleasantly surprised!","Only one man in Hollywood that I could think of could take six superheroes and knit them together so seamlessly, giving them each a feeling of value to the team, have such a clever script and get the action sequences to such an exciting level. Whedon, after decades of hard work in television, has finally ascended from cult status and entered the big time with the highest grossing film of all time and an easy contender for one of the best movies in the genre of all time, if not certainly the most entertaining.I went in with very high expectations, expecting to enjoy it, but fearing that the film would be a bit beyond Joss's ability to make great. An ensemble cast of 8 main characters and it being the most anticipated film of the last 5 years with the studio breathing down the filmmakers' necks? That's a tough job description. I figured, it couldn't get better than 7/10, but I should've known not to doubt Whedon.Many will say that this film seems slow paced, but those are people who just want a popcorn flick with minimal character development and dialog. That said, if you pay attention to the dialog, this film manages to draw emotions from the audience, which is rare for a blockbuster type film. The film also manages to keep those scenes succinct enough to keep the audience from lulling. This film was made for the big screen, and was easily the most fun I've had at the theaters in my 28 years.If you are a fan of the comics, you will love how the characters all have their complex attributes displayed, and how all their strengths combine to form a team. You think, ""How will Captain America, Hawkeye or Black Widow be of any use when Iron Man, Hulk and Thor are out wrecking sh*t?"", but there they are adding a dynamic to the team that would sorely needed in their absence. Captain is a born leader, Black Widow is manipulative and cunning, Hawkeye is incredibly reliable support, Iron Man and Thor wreck sh*t, Fury is the soul of the team, and Hulk smashes.The movie spends a lot of time setting things up, but does it so efficiently that you never really find yourself getting tired of all the exposition. As the story moves along, the humor in the script shines. The acting is solid across the board, with exceptional work by Downey who provides much needed lightness and Ruffalo who absolutely nailed Bruce Banner in a way that wasn't whiny and pathetic like Bana's or Norton's. The ending is as somber as it is victorious, and Whedon sets things up for what I hope is a much darker and more introspective sequel.While certainly not the greatest film of all time, for the genre, it couldn't get any better in my opinion. A movie like this is why big theaters exist, and if you wait until it comes out on DVD, you'll be missing out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Kids Avengers,"This was a highly anticipated title for me and may be for everyone else as well. But when I actually saw this Movie, I don't think this movie deserves this type of rating. Its so much over rated.I don't mean this move is bad, the movie is good but so over rated and you will only find kid's stuff in there. I think this one is really made for little kids. Don't watch this movie expecting something like Iron Man 2 or Thor. It is not very well written and the plot is not very strong, not a serious movie. I think having this type of budged and all the great actors is such a waste. And I believe only the kids have rated it so high.If you want to enjoy this movie then do not expect anything like iron man or Thor, you will be disappointed if you will have those expectations.The major issue with this movie is its script and weak plot, the antagonist is incredibly cheap and stupid as well. They could have used some better ideas. Although there are a lot of special effects and a lot of actions which is good. But it just do not fits it to an 8+ it is an average movie which deserves something 6/10. So don't believe the hype.Thank you, Khurram Saeed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Disappointing Waste of Talent,"Immediately after watching The Avengers, I was confused. All of my friends seemed to love it, the theater roared its approval as the credits rolled, and most of the reviews I've read are overwhelmingly positive. For these reasons, I'm not entirely sure I watched the same movie as everybody else, but I'm perfectly willing to comment on what I saw.The film opens with Loki stealing the Tesseract, an all powerful energy device that poses a significant threat to Earth's security. Thankfully, Nick Fury assembles the ""Avengers"", the group of superheroes who are the focus of the film. Robert Downey Jr, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, and Mark Ruffalo all reprise their roles of Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and the Incredible Hulk, while Scarlet Johansson and Jeremy Renner portray the Black Widow and Hawkeye. Every single one of these characters (Loki included) is entirely one-dimensional and frankly, boring to watch. With the possible exception of the Hulk, they are straight-forward, flawless superheroes, who have absolutely no trouble dispatching anyone who crosses them. This makes the prolonged action sequences particularly difficult to watch; you never doubt who is going to prevail.As for the central story of the film, it is a complete mess. It's an action movie in the truest sense of the word; every aspect of the plot is twisted to encourage more fighting sequences, which really prevents the film from moving forward at all. The story doesn't provoke further thought in any way, and really just serves to provide mindless action and downright terrible dialogue. In particular, Downey Jr. relentlessly delivers sarcastic insults every few minutes, which just aren't that funny (in my opinion). Once or twice, I found it amusing, but by the end of the movie I was sick of it. The other characters aren't much better, with the exception of Thor, who had a few funny moments.Despite everything I have said, there's no criticizing how the film looks. The CGI sequences are stunning, and the various locations in the film are visually pleasing. It doesn't break any new ground, but it's still entertaining.Overall, this is not a good movie. The characters are flat, static, uninteresting people portrayed by uninspired actors. The story is atrocious and riddled with holes. The action sequences are painfully long and predictable. And perhaps worst of all, when it was trying so hard to be funny, it simply wasn't.Looking at all the names that contributed to this movie, I am frankly shocked at the finished product. Joss Whedon is a brilliant director and writer (I loved Firefly), and most of the actors (particularly Downey Jr., Renner, and Ruffalo) are usually enjoyable. So I'm not quite sure where everything went wrong, but hopefully they can produce a more thoughtful sequel with their next efforts.RATING: 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Almost as good as the Dark Knight,"I admit it's been a while since I have seen this film but I have yet to give a proper review. Hopefully, this review can trigger the awesome feelings you had when watching The Avengers.This is what the Marvel movies have been leading up to, that is, every Marvel movie excluding the Spider-Man trilogy. The amount of hype behind this movie was tremendous; while waiting in line for The Avengers, the usher at the theater tells us that ""this is the best movie I have seen in 5 years"". That being said, it's extremely hard to go into this film without any expectations.So the question then is, was The Avengers good? If I can, I would call it Marvel-ous.Let's start with what I really enjoyed.The two strongest parts of The Avengers are the beginning and the end. When the film opens, we get to see the heros in their respective environments. And the opening scene with Black Widow stands out as one of the best. After Loki threatens Earth, the Avengers team has to assemble. Watching the team finally come together after waiting so many years, is a special moment. Now, the end was good because we finally get to see The Avengers work together as a team. While it took the entire movie for the Marvel heros to figure out that they are stronger as a unit than as individuals, it's worth the wait. How the camera panned across each hero who was doing something that effected the next person was stunning. To me, this felt the most like an actual comic book of video game.The humor and writing really stand out as good. I found myself laughing a lot more than I thought at this movie (and that works for this film). The Marvel movies have always been bright and very light hearted at times, and the script really made that aspect shine through.The two sides of the Hulk.The hulk was one of the best parts of this movie along with the relationship between Captain America and Iron man (I hope they set up the Civil War story). However, if I had one flaw with The Avengers, it would be Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner . Honestly, I thought both previous actors (Bana and Norton) played the part better.I know there is a ton more content to this film, but I should save that for when I get the film again on Blu Ray and have a fresh viewing.Overall, The Avengers is a superhero film done right. Everything just seemed to mesh and fall right into place. However, I am not giving it a 10 just yet, because The Dark Knight Rises is coming out soon and I believe that it will be better than The Avengers.9.0out of 10""Better clench up, Legolas""",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The characters, the action, and the special effects are what made The Avengers put a smile on my face.I have to say my favorite characters were Black Widow, and Hawkeye.

Believe the Hype!!,"I'm pretty sure I had a grin on my face the whole 2 hours and 20 minutes, including the 20 minutes I waited after the film to check that there wasn't a sneak peek after the credits. It's got a great great story, which is relatively true to the comics. Stan Lee MUST have had a lot of creative input into it. Really makes a difference. Shows why his comics have been around for almost 80 years.Considering how many 'big' characters there are, the character development is fantastic. you really buy in to each of their personal agendas and feelings. The guy who plays the Hulk, is just incredible. Never seen him before, I don't think. He gives you the impression that he is a loaded gun that can crack at any point, fly of the handle and turn into this massive green smashing machine (which obviously he does). The tension is incredible. It's got laugh out loud moments liberally scattered throughout, that was making the whole cinema laugh. Most of them coming from either Robert Downy Jr, or weirdly enough, the Hulk.I have to say I felt really comic book geeky as there was one line that only comic geeks would have got. I laughed and about 4 other people behind me laughed. Ironicially enough we were also the people that stayed until after the credits.The last act has some of the best action sequences that have ever been put on film, period. The CGI, which there is a lot of, didn't feel like CGI. You are so engrossed and it is done so well, that you forget that it actually is CGI.It certainly helps to have a grounding in the Marvel films that preceded it, but it's definitely not necessary. I have seen them all, so I can't be completely certain, but I think you'd do OK even if you haven't. There are some quick flashbacks and some expository dialogue about what's happened in the other films, enough to bring you up to a good enough level to get it, I think. Obviously it's better if you've seen them, though, so if you haven't yet, I highly recommend filling in the gaps. I would say that, in descending order of usefulness, you should see: Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, Iron Man 2, Iron Man, and The Incredible Hulk.. Adding to that, my girlfriend hasn't seen any of them, I thought she would just think it was a geeky film, but she LOVED it, I was shocked. So much so that we'll be watching Iron Man 1 and 2 at her suggestion.I read loads of reviews saying that it is not worth watching in 3-D. I have to say, I completely disagree. There is a lot more they could have done with the 3-D element. For example, Hawkeye, with his arrows would be amazing, you know firing arrows at your face etc, but I prefer the subtle bits of 3-D when you do not even realise. When it doesn't distract you from the film. There are bits at the end of the last act, where there are bits of ash just floating about, in 3-D. Very subtle. Very Good.There is a bit after the initial credits, so stay for a bit, not a lot of people will get the character they show, as it is not a familiar villain, but it does set up for a sequel, which will struggle to top this movie.It is very rare that a movie lives up to the hype, especially for me, but this will be the movie of the year. Spiderman, Batman, will struggle to replicate the success, if they can, they will be amazing too.It's the best superhero film ever made, that's not hyperbole.Oh also Scarlett Johanson is in it and she is my favourite!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the Greatest Blockbusters of All Time. A Perfect Popcorn Entertainer.,"One of the most entertaining & expertly curated films of all time, The Avengers is an ambitious adventure for the masses that contains all the right ingredients of a genuine blockbuster material and is a highly entertaining, fun-filled, roller-coaster ride whose significant emphasis on perfect balance of humour & action throughout its runtime turns it into an ideal popcorn entertainer for all ages.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Avengers - Your character defines your point of view.,"Living in a world of more than 7 billion people, one must consider this as a critical fact, without trying to counter-argue for any reason whatsoever: the diversity in opinions can be unimaginably huge.And what is the reason for this? What are the main variables that are to be held responsible for someone's opinions? Well, there is the environment we grow up & live in, for two big ones, with all their subcategories, like the people that surround us and their beliefs of any kind. If you grow up, for example, in a family that values honesty, they'll probably push you into becoming an honest being. If you grow up in a family that enjoys watching comedies in their free time, you'll probably grow a ""thing"" for comedies later on in your life - no matter how attracted you may become to other genres of movies, a comedy will always be something you enjoy for various reasons, the remembrance of your happy family moments for one.Let's say you're a fan of Sci-Fi movies. You most likely grew up watching such and you've definitely been taken your breath away by certain ""classics"", as we call them nowadays, that left you with some kind of a mental mark about how awesome they were. Alien, for instance. A totally breath-taking Horror film, a masterpiece for it's kind, it's era.So, to my point: It is wrong to compare any new film to the one that let you breathless. I mean, feel free to judge that what you just watched is better or worse, but you can't direct a whole review to why a movie ""rocked your world"" or ""totaly sucked"" based on your mental mark about your favorite movie and it's perfect, to you, characteristics, specifications & moments. Of course, there are reasons and places to do so, if for example there is an award to be given between two or more, but nothing more or less.I did enjoy The Avengers. I did enjoy the cast. I believe that Robert Downey Jr. acts in a very stylish, awesome for me way, that I might have enjoyed the movie only because I like him as Iron Man. Mark Ruffalo and Christ Hemsworth are very amusing to watch as well, their impersonations of The Hulk and Thor being incredibly amazing. Overally the cast fit their roles well-enough to create an enjoyable, rocking atmosphere that will hold you tight in place until the very end.There were plenty of moments where I was slightly disappointed, like the extreme damage and conditions that Iron Man's suit could sustain - the movie could have been better at certain points like these, but the overall experience compensated. Hey!, it's based on hardcore comic books after all, and director's Joss Whedon great attention to it's making is clearly noticeable, if you've read the comics.The movie was worth my time, and I give it a seven out of ten. I've seen a couple of better Action Sci-Fi movies, matter of personal preference, and there always must be place for even better ones, since human capabilities can't be imagined. Thus, a seven from me to The Avengers, makes this Action Sci-Fi a must-see to those that agree with me. An outstanding production.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Even with some flaws, excellent and one of the best movies of Marvel Heroes","I'll make it simple:Best points: Action scenes, Scarlett Johansson, Iron Man, HulkLow points: Captain AmericaI went to see this movie in 2D because i don't like the 3D, but after awhile i was regretting it because the scenes are awesome and must be really great in 3D, even in 2D the Heroes and creatures seem to come inside the cinema.Captain America is so wrongly portrayed here, it's a mix of the old one of the comics in the 60's with the new one of Civil War, when the best comics of Captain America were in the 80's and 90's, he's supposed to be a man, not a kid, he's supposed to have a strong voice, not a sweet women lovable voice, he's supposed to be a bulk, not a normal gym guy, he's supposed to have an armor that shows respect and represents dignity, not a plastic suit that looks a carnival suit for kids, he's supposed to throw his shield like it was easy and light for him, and not heavy or with much effort, the shield it's supposed to be an extension of his arm and not his shoulder, He's supposed to be a leader and not someone who tells jokes, he never makes anyone laugh, he's the moral standards of every group, something that no Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, or other hero can do as him, because apart from his serum and special abilities he represents humanity at his best, not a playboy business man, or a God, or a monster, he's representing the best of mankind and human spirit, he's more then a soldier, and last but not least, he never takes a gun and starts shooting! Apart from that(because Captain America is one of my heroes) i can't give a 9 to this movie, all the scenes are great, Loki isn't that good as everyone says here, a god doesn't spit to a glass while talking, you don't even know if gods have saliva, it's not cool, but anyway i think it deserves a 9.5. Because i can't give that, and, although it doesn't respect Captain America spirit right, it's an awesome movie, 10 stars!Best part of the movie is the scene when Hulk starts fighting the bad guys, you won't get better excitement and thrill then this, not even on the Hulk movies, what a shame for those two...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Junkiest movie ever,"If you know the story, the only things that will matter will be the special effects. If you don't know the story, the only things that will matter will be the special effects. Why? Well... there is no story, just special effects - lots of them. There is no plot. Nothing makes sense, unless you know the characters' backgrounds ...and if you do, you will think this movie should be at least an hour longer, so the screenwriter could squeeze some actual dialogues in between all the action. If you take away all the eye-candy, this movie would be less than 15 minutes long - major flunk, imo. This is a movie to forget about. After you leave the theater, and talk about some of the scenes people might have enjoyed, it goes into utter oblivion - I'm sure I won't be looking forward to buying this for my DVD/BR collection.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the best comic book movies i've ever seen.,"What can I say about the Avengers that everyone else hasn't already said? Well, believe the hype! it's great! why? well numerous reasons. One of them is the director they chose for the job of bringing one of the most iconic super teams in comics to life.Joss Whedon has showed time and time again that he knows about both the Marvel Universe (see his run on Astonishing X-men) and Team dynamics(See Firefly or any of his other works)and he works his magic to the max here. another reason is the great cast. while all good, two performances really stand out to me. The first one is Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk and the second one is Tom Hiddleston as Loki. While I enjoyed Ed Norton's Banner, I felt something was missing from him, Likability. Mark Ruffalo had Likability. Tom Hiddleston's Loki was a great villain that really had that sinister aura about him and he's better here than he was in Thor. Another Reason is the action. Not only does the final scene have An epic battle that rivals Robots trashing Chicago in Transformers 3 (This is way cooler) But other great action scenes come throughout the movie. one of my favorites is the scene at the beginning where Loki steals the Tesseract/Cosmic Cube and takes down a whole bunch of S.H.I.E.L.D agents including Nick Fury and Hawkeye. Also, The plot is fairly simplistic but what really makes this movie shone is the character dynamics. So final verdict: possibly the best movie of the summer of 2012. Assemble and go see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Avengers Assemble Most Adroitly,"Unless you are the sort of cinematic snob who can only appreciate avant-garde short subjects in tiny projection rooms, then chances are pretty good that you'll have a rollicking good time watching this 2012 megawatt adventure epic. I certainly did, and I wouldn't consider myself a die-hard Marvel comic book fan. I enjoyed the derring-do and ironic humor that infused the comic book films preceding this one, but director/screenwriter Joss Whedon really whips together all the formula elements that made ""Iron Man"" (1 & 2), ""The Incredible Hulk"" (the 2008 version), ""Thor"" and ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" purely entertaining into something that miraculously makes the larger-than-life dimensions of the superheroes more instantly relatable. A top-notch cast certainly helps as does the armada of technicians who pull off the effects in all their 3-D, eye-popping glory, of course, but much of the credit really needs to go to Whedon for making this film as much fun as a comic book.Running a surprisingly fleet 143 minutes, the potentially convoluted plot allows Nick Fury, a character heretofore limited to tantalizing post-credits scenes in the previous movies, to take center stage. He's the surly one-eyed leader of S.H.I.E.L.D., the peacekeeping agency who must quickly recruit a team of superheroes to do battle with Loki, the deceitful half-brother of Thor, the Norse deity of thunder. Loki has brainwashed archer supreme Hawkeye and brilliant physicist Dr. Erik Selvig (already seen in ""Thor"") while stealing a cosmic cube called the Tesseract, a powerful energy source of seemingly limitless potential, from a remote research facility. Fury recruits Black Widow, a former Russian spy last seen in action in ""Iron Man 2"", to gather the troops including a highly reticent Bruce Banner a.k.a. the Hulk. Meanwhile, Iron Man, Captain America and Thor have to learn to get along before facing the enemy.Loki turns out to be the least of their problems as the Tesseract unleashes a powerful alien race known as the Chitauri, which leads to the inevitable battle royale on the devastated streets of Manhattan. While the state-of-the-art action scenes are everything you want them to be, it's really the film's unexpected sense of humor that consistently buoys the story. Realizing the escalating level of implausibility, Whedon smartly provides clever lines and scenes to everyone (and not just Robert Downey, Jr.) For instance, after Thor proclaims Loki solemnly as his Asgardian brother, Black Widow points out that he killed eighty people in two days to which Thor points out Loki was adopted. Later, in the most crowd-pleasing scene, the Hulk grabs a character by his leg and whip-slams him into the floor like he's beating a dust rag. The defiance of logic and physics is par for the course here, and Whedon's kid-like attitude and deft hand make it all the more exhilarating.The physically fit cast work surprisingly well together as an ensemble. While Downey's scene-stealing as Iron Man is a given, Chris Evans' Captain America, Chris Hemsworth's Thor, Mark Ruffalo's digitally altered Hulk, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye all get their moments to shine. As Loki, Tom Hiddleston effectively conveys the inferiority complex that drives his villain with slithery cunning, while Samuel L. Jackson and Clark Gregg take full advantage of expanded roles as Fury and Agent Coulson respectively. The mistake most filmmakers make in showing an Armageddon situation is applying too much soul-baring gravitas to the proceedings. That's definitely not Whedon's take as he never lets us forget that we are watching a comic book come to life. It's gratifying to watch a popcorn movie that actually lives up to the hype in all its commercial glory.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Avengers is Mighty Comic Book Fun,"Between a massive advertising blitz and some none-too-subtle hints that Marvel has been dropping in their films for the last four years, Joss Whedon's Avengers adaptation is one of the most eagerly anticipated blockbusters in recent memory. With most of Marvel's flagship characters- played by some of Hollywood's biggest stars- assembled together in a big budget production co-written and directed by the man responsible for Buffy and Firefly, the premise alone is enough to make fanboys swoon. This is a project with some very high expectations to meet. And having seen it, I for one would say that it has met them.It would not be much of a stretch to say that the Avengers is what every summer blockbuster wants to be. Given a few hundred million dollars and near total creative control, what director wouldn't want to make a film like this. In its two and a half hour running time, it delivers a coherent storyline, several likable, well developed protagonists, and enough action and explosions to show up Michal Bay.I mention this notorious director because his Transformers films, particularly the latter entries, have made millions on the idea that brainless fight scenes, gratuitous pyrotechnics, and more than a little T&A are all it takes to make an action movie; no acting, writing, wit, or originality needed. But Avengers shows that that's not true. Like a certain other superhero franchise due to release its final installment later this summer, Avengers works as much because of its human drama as its action and special effects.One of the main reasons the Fantastic Four movies didn't work, aside from weak screenplays and wooden acting, was that we never bought the idea that the actors on screen were a team. In the first film, they utterly lacked the kind of chemistry that would be expected of friends and co-workers. In the second entry, the chemistry was so forced that they seemed like a sitcom family. Avengers suffers from neither of these problems. Chris Evens, Chris Hemsworth, Robert Downy Junior, Scarlett Johansen, Samuel L Jackson, and Mark Ruffalo not only shine on their own, but also work seamlessly together as part of a team, playing of each other's strengths and personalities.Between Stark's cynicism, casual arrogance, and roguish charm, Cap's loyalty and earnestness, Banner's demur, unobtrusive nerdiness, and Thor's zeal and new found humility, all of the leads get the chance to establish themselves as well rounded characters, and to remind us why we liked them in the first place. And like a real team, the characters don't always get along from the moment they first meet. They keep secrets. They question each others' motivations and commitments. They get on each others' nerves. And they certainly let their egos clash. In fact, some of the best fight scenes are between the heroes. But like real people, they put aside their differences and their egos. They learn to trust each other and work together, in a way not nearly as sappy or clichéd as it suddenly sounds when I'm writing it.The casting of Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury continues to seem like a better and better idea all the time. He might not be able to go all out, what with this being a PG-13 production, but there were moments that, for me at least, very much invoked fond memories of Pulp Fiction. Tom Hiddleston also does very good work as the villainous Loki. His air of condescension and supreme self confidence makes him instantly loathable, and the hint of jealousy and subtle desperation in his voice, together with his piercing, wide eyed stare gives the unmistakable impression that something is definitely not right inside his head. Watching the heroes give him the beating he deserves is a supremely satisfying experience.And like I said, the action is great too. The numerous fights and shootouts are excellently choreographed and filmed, and the climactic alien invasion is stunning in its size and complexity. It's like a non-sucky Battlefield LA, and the cost must have been astronomical. I'm also highly impressed at how long the film was able to keep the action and sense of excitement going. From start to finish, the final battle lasted roughly half an hour, without getting bogged down or becoming overly repetitive.Add in some typically Whedon-esque humor and a fair number of insider references to the comics, Avengers is mighty entertainment, and everything that fans could have hoped for. I look forward to Marvel's inevitable follow-up, and to the director's next project. I don't know why it's taken so long, but Joss Whedon has finally arrived in Hollywood, and I expect to see much more of him in the near future.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Decent, but Generic","It's a fun movie, but the plot is very generic and shallow. The villains in this movie are extremely weak. Without giving away the plot, at no point does the viewer actually feel the superheroes are in danger.I have an irrational hatred of Captain America so I am rounding down from the 6.5 score that I feel it deserves. (His quote about Hitler directly contradicts his role in the film, he's a filthy hypocrite that gives the AMERICUH!! vibe.) It's a fun watch, but this is evidence of the dumbing down of cinema for a worldwide audience.Overseas markets are big money, but because cultures are so diverse, to appeal to the world the movie is forced into a least common denominator.

A star-studded cast assemble to create the greatest superhero movie of all time...,"Superman: The Movie, The Dark Knight and The Avengers. Yes ""The Avengers"" does indeed stand tall amongst the greatest superhero movies of all time.A stellar cast assemble to create a marvel of a film, pun definitely intended. The special effects are top notch and never look out of place like superhero movies of the past. However it is truly the story that is most appreciated since it is the final act of an intricate tightly woven plot that has been building through the current generation of Marvel films (Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger) and ends with the best superhero finale ever conceived for the big screen. Yes its that good. The only factor that could have been reduced was the amount of humour and sarcasm following certain kick-ass scenes which could have benefited with a touch of cool. In retrospect the humour mostly gets it right and compliments the ""comic book"" feel of the movie, which is what we have all desperately wanted for so long: A comic book movie that truly sets your mind free like the comic books and cartoons we all read and watched growing up thinking anything was possible.I applaud you Marvel as ""The Avengers"" now stands as one of the greatest, if not the greatest superhero movie of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nothing but a Disappointment,"I was really looking forward to seeing this film after hearing so much good feedback, however when I finally saw it I was disappointed by the lack of conflict and sense of the entire film.

Most of the main characters weren't needed like Black Widow, Hawkeye, Thor, and Captain America. The same results could have been achieved if the Hulk and Iron Man were the only heroes. The ease that the Avengers had in defeating Loki made the film boring and regrettable to watch. I found myself on the verge of falling asleep during this entire film.

If you are interested at all you will like it,"I went into this movie with an assumption. I figured that the action scenes would be awesome. Marvel had shown that they were very capable of great action sequences and this would be no exception.However, action alone doesn't make a good movie (matrix sequels). This was the part that I was worried about. Would the story and characters be good enough to match the explosive action? The answer is a resounding YES! Great character interactions, hilarious dialog, a true comic book story (not deep like Dark Knight but fun like Iron Man). All of the characters have roles that feel natural and the dialog flows. Robert Downey Jr getting Joss Whedon lines is as good as it sounds and I never realized how hilariously awesome the hulk could be.There are a few problems I had with the movie such as Captain America's back story, no wait I really just hated the Captain America movie.

A movie that assembles and conquers.,"Wow, it has finally arrived. Marvel has had one hell of a project, coming up with movies exploring the origin stories of some of the most iconic superheroes of all time while adding small but subtle connections to each other as a way to show fans what is coming over the horizon. The result is an all-out marvel mash as Earth's mightiest heroes have come together to face a threat no one hero could possibly face alone. They are the Avengers.Loki, the god of mischief, has come to conquer the Earth with an unspeakable alien force to back him up. To make matters worse, he has obtained an ancient artifact with virtually limitless power as his disposal. In desperation, Nick Fury, director of the peace-keeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D., assembles together the greatest heroes the world has ever seen: Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and the Incredible Hulk. If these extraordinary independent individuals can learn to work together, their combined might be enough to conquer this global threat.This is every comic book geeks dream team and dream movie. The faces we have all grown up with and come to love finally together in one film. Normally, such a task is highly risky because not only do the filmmakers have to be faithful to the comics, but also appeal to what the fans would want to see in The Avengers, not to mention avoid any plot holes. Thankfully, this movie does it all plus more. It is, dare I say it, incredible!The action scenes are some of the best in the superhero genre, lots of shooting, punching, and, of course, smashing. Things get really insane and everything in sight gets totally destroyed as the forces of good and evil duke it out. All the characters have practically equal back story, interactions, and amount of fighting, even characters like Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Nick Fury. With this, not one seems left out or doesn't get enough of these elements. Dialog is written very well and there's a surprising amount of comedy throughout the film (and it's hard not to laugh with it). There's lots of great moments and none of it seems the least bit corny.In conclusion, this will satisfy anyone, especially the fans. Everything people hope to see is brought to life and it kicks serious butt. With fantastic action scenes, excellent special effects, well-written script, cool music, and surprisingly great comedy, The Avengers is sure to satisfy in every way. On a scale of one to ten, I would give this movie a twenty (it's a shame I can't physically give such a rating)! Go check out this awesome flick and enjoy!

Great Superhero movie for Kids but nowhere near what I expected!,"OK glad to start doing reviews on IMDb.The Avengers 'WHAT A MOVIE' seems to be the line on everybody's lips. Well I am going to say after seeing it both 3D and 2D that I can make an honest objective opinion.The special effects which whether you like it or not is one of the movie's highlights. YES they are GOOD and nicely done BUT why the 3D? Why did I pay for a 3D movie where the 3D was never used in his pure awesomeness? Yes it's cheesy and cheap to see boulders, pieces of buildings tires, arrows explosions and all sort of stuff flying towards you but it's ALSO FUN & that's why you go to see it in 3D. Well let me tell you this movie HAS NONE of that. No Sir it's just simple digital 3D shots of New York and other stuff! NOTHING SPECIAL...sad to see that after 3-4 years AVATAR still holds the CROWN it should give you an idea about this.Acting is good all the way to great. AND YES Tony Stark (Robert Downey JR. steals the show) which can be good if your a fan like me but can also be bad for the rest of the crew. He is great the others are OK. HULK is amazing but then again he is CGI!The story and here is where it starts to get annoying. Guys some of these characters did not have they're own movie so it's hard to relate to them get to care for them especially when you won't have enough time to do so...So why so much Black Widow? Then again why no drama no connections between them. I honestly expected to see Captain America fall for Black Widow as the comic books say. Still it's the 1st part so there is time but make's you feel like you haven't been treated with the whole cake but a cookie.Going to the action scene is where I get disappointed! Alien Invasion??? Where in the middle of New York with no real damage to the city. What happened to the BIG BOOMS and explosions. Where the hell was the ARMY? Where were all those special weapons STARK created for so long. Where the hell was WAR MACHINE as the Air Force Commander. No Sir here you will only see a bunch of cops (fat ones also) fighting alongside our 6 fellas to protect the city. And the only idea the government has is to NUKE the city 10 minutes after the invasion. Very ORIGINAL it was one of those sad moments in my life as a movie enthusiast where I actually did MISSED Michael Bay and his explosions and action scenes. Again you can make an idea about the War Scene.Ending this review with my last disappointment! I know I know it'a a PG movie but PLEASE stop making it so if you going to loose every bit of drama left in the movie. Yes you won't see swearing in the movie or blood or naked women or at least people dying. NO NO this is a kids movie with superheroes that is no where near as good as IMDb score is now.

Also, you don't have time to think about what's going to happen next in the story and that's because movie sucks you in so much, you have enough time to just be focused on what's going on right in front of you, and what's in front of you is moments you don't want to miss. On top of that, you have awesome effects and very good acting (you can't not to love Tony Stark!). This movie managed to make me feel like a little kid again and it was awesome!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Quite possibly the best comic adaptation I have ever seen.,"I am a HUGE Marvel fan. While I haven't read most of the comics in years I still enjoy the characters. Stan lee is a genius and it is wonderful to see his creations coming to the big screen and NOT be a poor, bad acted, cheesy, knock off. This movie, says it all. It shows everyone exactly why they love these comics. And that is simply that we can all be more than the sum of what we are, or perceive ourselves to be.The prior movies are also very close to my heart. Iron man sold me on Robert Downing Jr. again as an actor and someone who can rise above. RDJ personifies Iron Man perfectly, there is no other actor that could ever come close. The turmoil he has in this movie, the battle between his ego and doing what is right despite personal loss is, well, it's a work of pure art.Chris Hemsworth once again shows the world that a man can play a god. He does it with grace and strength, and with my humble opinion; a human element, knowing that while he is stronger than all of his counterparts physically (except Hulk) he is also weak. He gives a character that could have easily have been a ""I am better than you because I am a god"" a sense of humanity and humility. Thor is a protector of earth, and he protects her with a fierce resolve.Mark Ruffalo, while I was a bit disappointed that Ed Norton would not be playing Hulk, I was happy and thrilled with the choice. Mr. Ruffalo shows all aspects of the Hulk with smooth, fluid motion. The anger he has to contain, the control he has, he should teach a class on anger management. He shows what I believe to be a true Hulk. The human that fights the beast within. Who among us can say we don't have a little of that in us?Chris Evans, he was the Torch, a cocky, show off that loved the lime light. I was worried about him being a soldier, THE soldier. When I saw Captain America I was blown away by his scope. Something he continues to bring to this movie. He portrays The Captain as a soldier, a soldier out of time. And yet he is quick to adapt, and lead a group of people that you wouldn't imagine could be a team. He honors Captain America with his portrayal of him.Jeremy Renner, I haven't seen many of his movies, but the ones I have I have enjoyed immensely. He took a character that could have easily been just a side note and made him shine. Showing the elements you would expect to see in an assassin. I truly hope that we get to see a solo act for him, I think it would be worth it.Scarlett Johansson continues to portray The Black Widow with skill and grace. She is beautiful and deadly, the perfect Black Widow. Maybe a movie with her and Jeremy Renner? Something to think about.Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury was inspired. And in this film you actually get to see more than just Nick Fury popping in for some advice giving and then popping back out. He shows that Nick Fury is a bad ass to be reckoned with. Even standing up to those in charge when he knows their decision is wrong.Clark Gregg, aka Agent Coulson, I will tell you the truth here, I thought he was nothing more than a filler, but he nearly stole the show for me. He did an incredible job, and has in all of these films. He shows an agent that is direct and very much a ""man in black"", but then you find that he, well, he has the biggest heart. And he delivers it with a fantastic dry wit. The entire movie was bound together effortlessly with poise, and that sense that we as lowly humans will not back down in the face of impending death, but will fight it until there is no more of us.The last person I want to mention is Joss Whedon. I LOVE this genius, this man who can seamlessly put danger, action, and humor together. He did it with Buffy, Angel, and Firefly. I admire his work to the point that I will watch anything, and everything of his. He was the perfect choice for this, and I can' wait to see what he comes up with next.The overview of this movie is simply, words can no do it justice. It was not just a movie, it was truly an experience. You are sucked into the story, shown by so many different aspects. I have been disappointed with some of the comic movies, X-men:Final Stand, comes to mind (someone please tell me, WHERE in the X-men comics did Charles die? Last I checked he didn't). And with those disappointments comes that lingering feeling of doubt that the movie will not live up to it's hype. I was thrilled that not only did The Avengers, live up to its hype. It surpassed it.I have only one humble request, that the next one have Spider-man, and Wolverine.I recommend this movie to everyone, as it is the personification of why we go to movies, and why this business is a multi-billion dollar one. That we all need to escape our tired lives for a little while and be swept away to a world where, just for two hours, everything makes sense. The bad guys always lose, and the good guys win, with style. :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Amazing mix of heroes, nothing short of sublime","Here is the movie they were preparing us for. 'Iron Man'. 'Captain America'. 'Thor'. This was where they would eventually go. And brother, it didn't disappoint.Joss Whedon's magnum opus boasts more stars than the paramount logo and more capable direction and a more taut script than most of the so-called 'superhero' movies made. The movie featured an interesting mix of Marvel heroes coming together as a team when the Earth is in crisis, to save the world. From a spectacular intro where Loki arrives unexpectedly at SHIELD hq to the brilliant final showdown, 'Avengers' is a thrill ride, never letting go. This is *the* summer blockbuster that people should be lining up to see. Lots of action, lots of thrills, superheroes and and a badass villain. Every scene of the film is dripping with homages to superhero fiction. The one liners are numerous and never seem forced. Iron man's quips are just as well timed as always.Enhancing the action and thrills is the soul of the film which lies in its subtle use of emotions. Joss Whedon has done a remarkable job in adding a huge wave of emotion that runs over the film. Iron man is the machine with a heart, who never shows it. the Hulk is the definition of all heart and no mind to control it. And most surprising of all, Black Widow comes with a beautifully nuanced performance. All hints of fear, love and hatred evident in her subtle reactions. Scarlett Johansson is a casting choice to be applauded, as is Mark Ruffalo since I now cannot imagine anyone doing better justice to the role.The only flaw I could think up was the Marvel universe as such. I don't understand why the X-men weren't considered for the Avengers program (legal rights to the characters issues). But the movie is a wonderful viewing experience and by all means, a treasure. Must see for the summer of 2012.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A great overall film.,"I just got back from the film on the 27th of April watching Avengers, it's totally worth watching I would not hold back from suggesting anyone to watch it.Through out the whole film there was continuous laughter through out the cinema during the film.It was worth every penny even although it was rather expensive to watch costing £9.85 for a 3d showing at our local cinema in Wigan.I do really hope this short review not giving anything away will help you to decide to whether you want to watch it or not and if you do I hope you will enjoy it like I did when I went watching it.ALso I would like there to be a second film on this because I think that could be even better!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Consistently enjoyable effects and noise with the right amount of fun mixed in,"You could be forgiven for approaching this film with trepidation for many reasons. The most obvious is that it is a big superhero summer blockbuster film – a type of film that is popular but all too often disappointing (indeed an accusation that could be levelled at films featuring characters in this film). Secondly though, a common problem with all the various character films leading up to this joint effort is that they generally struggled to make all the characters fit and you had the constant feeling that all the positioning and introductions were hurting the individual tales just for the sake of this joint one; so I did wonder how it was going to cope with all these characters running around in one place.Ironically enough though, the character balancing turns out to not be a massive problem in this case and I think it is partly because they do all exist as equals within the same plot lines, rather than being forced onto others. The plot is suitably overblown and involves an intergalactic threat rather than a man-made one; again this concerned me at first because I didn't particularly care for Thor and I did get the feeling that this would be more of the same, with gods and mythical creatures running around. To a point this was the case here because to the casual viewer (which I am), these aliens aren't really known or understood but the film does make it work because it allows it to be just about serious enough to avoid spoof but at the same time generating sufficient fun so that you go along with it. In some ways it is the polar opposite of the other big superhero franchise out this summer (Batman) because where one aims for darkness and introspection, Avengers really has no interest and instead focuses on delivering fun and action in an easily accessible and enjoyable package.And this it does. Across all the characters we have good humour and banter which never undermines the action but rather adds to it, giving it a sense of fun that engages and helpfully prevents you questioning the detail too much or having things like specific comic banter stand out against the serious nature of the action. There are lots of nice comic touches and lines but for me Hulk randomly punching Thor was the high point (with the ""puny god"" moment being a very close second). The cast go with it and I liked that everyone did work together without any one specific character hogging too much of the screen. Downey Jr is fun as normal and he works well with Evans, who I thought was better here than he was in his own film. Likewise Hemsworth benefits from a bit of decent humour and fun (two things lacking in his own film) and Ruffalo makes for a good Hulk, again though he is helped by the lack of having to carry a whole film. Johansson and Renner are good in support and the rest of the cast features good turns from many familiar faces, none of whom get in the way but all contribute to the fun.It is easy to turn your nose up at Avengers because it is basically an effects-driven summer blockbuster about superheroes, nothing something that always delivers, but to do so would be to ignore the fact that there are good and bad examples of this and that The Avengers is one of the good ones. Colourful, busy, fun and generally very entertaining – it delivers everything it sets out to do and I found it very enjoyable for this.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The Mark of A New Generation of ""Good Films""","The Avengers falls nowhere short of delivering a fiery and action packed roller coaster ride of explosions. The movie spends its time passing on the spotlight to each avenger, showing off his or her unique ways of dominating enemies and overcoming hazardous obstacles. Seeing all of our favorite superheroes unite under one common enemy is an exciting thought and was inevitable from one day working its way into a movie. Having an army of superheroes to save the world from utter destruction isn't always a bad thing, but for a film, sometimes less is more.While The Avengers offers many good fighting scenes, special effects, and cool futuristic gadgets that make your head spin, the fundamentals of a good film are simply lacking. The main problem with this movie is it's plethoric cast of superheroes. There are way too many to center on at once. As hinted earlier, the movie focuses too much on showing off each character one at a time, constantly switching the audience's support from one to another. Throughout the movie, there is a constant struggle for dominance between each avenger that involves boasting, smack talk, bouts, and interferences. Pretty soon the audience is divided up rooting for their favorite hero, and the whole idea of the main villain is dropped completely!The story is simple and clear: kill Loki. Scene after scene however, that mission is forgotten by two or more of the avengers trying to display their macho-ness to one another. Unlike many great movies, this plot line is drastically linear and bare to the bones in meaning. In the midst of the film, I thought I was watching an intense WWA match from the future. Six superheroes is just too many for one movie. The filmmakers did a good job focusing on each hero, but that is all they had time for. I can't help but think, if they only had two, maybe three main heroes, they would have had enough time to develop a more interesting and meaningful plot.Decades ago, we saw for the first time great and innovative movies like Star Wars, Terminator 1 and 2, Platoon, Alien, and (just last decade) The Dark Knight. All of these films were able to focus on several main characters, villains, and a storyline that were all intricately tied together and saturated with meaningful and thought-provoking ideas. In light of The Avengers' wide and warmly welcomed reception, it seems that the standards and expectations for ""good films"" has switched to a more dry and corny interpretation. All The Avengers truly has to offer is wild action scenes, interpersonal conflict, and imaginative applications of special effects. These assets however are known for never having the capability of elongating a films success and keeping it in the fond memories of its viewers. Movies like Star Wars, which originated in the 70's, lacked horribly in intense action, and animation, but the qualities of a good story and its creativity keeps it so popular to this day. Other examples of movies that only glimmered for their achievements in animation are ones like Avatar, which was quickly forgotten because it lacked a fundamentally solid story to remember.The Avengers is merely eye-candy that satisfies Marvel fans and audiences seeking captivating fight scenes. It is more appropriate to label this work a collection battle animated scenes rather than an actual movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent.,"This IS a well made summer blockbuster.The characters are interesting, the acting is great and the script is able to be fun, but also deep and well written, it has everything you may ask for an action movie and even more.Joss Whedon does an amazing work with the script; the acting, specially from Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo and Tom Hiddleston is Top Notch. The film builds tension during the first two act to culminate in an amazing climax, were the visuals are incredible.It's basically a role model. Like Star Trek in 2009, it can probably inspire a new wave of blockbusters which can be smart without being pretentious, powerful without being dark.It's an amazing film and I would recommend anyone to watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Disney Marvels at Whedon Assembly,"If you have been a fan of the core Marvel Studios' films since 2008's IRON MAN, where the beginnings of the ""Avengers Initiative"" were first teased and carried through into the 2010 sequel as well as THE INCREDIBLE HULK, THOR and CAPTAIN America: THE FIRST AVENGER, then the AVENGERS will not disappoint. In fact, it very well might make you question why the other franchise films weren't as good as this fast- paced, funny, superhero showdown.Marvel has been very focused and dedicated with the development of its properties under the Disney banner – and they no doubt wish that the Spider-Man and X-Men franchises could return to their fold, as it was the success of these earlier films that brought Marvel Comics out of bankruptcy – and has been providing solid entertainment from its creators and stars alike; by Odin's beard, Sir Kenneth Branagh directed THOR. Enter Joss Whedon, who created a weekly TV show in BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER that was a near-perfect example of a live-action comic book, to deliver a heavily-anticipated yet so-easy-to-fail production of getting such a diverse character set in a movie that worked. And worked it did.The film gets off to a slow and even somewhat murky start as Loki, Thor's mischievous half-brother, played with a Anthony Hopkins-worthy sneer by Tom Hiddleston, appears, escapes from and is responsible for the destruction of a SHIELD HQ as well as the spiriting away of a few supporting characters including Stellan Skarsgard's Dr. Selvig, also of THOR, and Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye, getting the full movie treatment here, all under the semi-impotent glare of Samuel L. Jackson's one-eyed spy Nick Fury. Obiously Loki never saw Samuel L's wallet from another film.The movie picks up with the re-introduction of Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow as Whedon has some fun showing what moves he could have presented in BUFFY if he had an Avengers-sized budget backing him up, but it truly gets bright when the three protagonists, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, finally appear and, of course, get into a wrestling match to prove who has the biggest repulsor/shield/hammer. Once the team finally assembles, insanity, and the hilarity that often follows, ensues. Oh, and Mark Ruffalo proves that the Hulk can indeed smash.Joss Whedon's adept skills, he also writes the screenplay, prove to be the other superhero powerhouse as he successfully created a production that pleases the hardcore fanboy who is aware of Thanos, the mainstream movie audience who thinks that Tony and Pepper are destined for each other, and his own loyal, core fan base of Browncoats. Each hero gets their own time to shine in situations worthy of a comicbook splash page. The rough-up dust-up of a third act that entirely deals with the assembled team involved in a street-level brawl in NYC against, what else, an invading alien army, could very well have became tedious, as admittedly, the obligatory interstellar menace is faceless, forgettable and seemingly invented for the sales of action figures, but the action, humor and allure of these powerful heroes is truly something unique and that magic is perfectly captured on the screen.2008 saw the release of both IRON MAN and Warner Bros.' DARK KNIGHT. The result was that both films set the bar that future genre films would have to follow. In 2012 that bar was set yet again. What remains to be seen is if the upcoming DARK KNIGHT RISES film, as well as the sequels for IRON MAN, THOR and CAPTAIN America, will continue to raise that bar, or if they will all just... assemble.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Avengers Assemble!,"So much build up and it all leads to this: And it's awesome! I know I'm late in reviewing this and everything has been said in all kinds of praise and this movie deserves it. Just see it. Even if you don't like comic book movies: See it.What I find amusing is that Ironman was never really the top billing of The Avengers. It was always Captain America... until now. Robert Downey Jr. steals every scene that his name is first on the credits. Seriously, he's that awesome. I was also surprised with Mark Ruffalo's performance as The Hulk. He was great! His scenes with Robert Downey Jr. are some of the most memorable. I also haven't seen the Thor flick but the guy who played them was really good and really seemed into character. Hawkeye was cool and Scarlett Johanssen is hot.Okay, the plot? Bad guy named Loki wants to take over the world and does a really good General Zod impression (Kneel before me!) and Avengers try to stop him. What's funny is that he looks tough in the beginning but then turns into a rag doll at the end. Just ask The Hulk. And whatever injustice the previous movies had done to The Hulk certainly makes up for it here.Just see it! It's a lot of fun and it's what summer movies are supposed to be.

"Joss Whedon is a human tank, like Thor.","The Avengers was the first movie I saw in theaters three times, and for darn good reason. It sets the bar so high for comic book movies. DC is (was) seriously in a lot of trouble after The Avengers came out. If you have seen each of our hero's individual films, you will easily enjoy The Avengers ten times more. You will be also ten times more excited to see everything played out.I also feel like I need to say that I was very, very nervous when I heard The Avengers was announced. In film, we like to focus on one character, and we like to see that one person change over the course of the movie. It's hard to keep track of multiple characters, which is why the single-hero format works so well. Otherwise we end up with meathead city, like The Expendables. Gross. Luckily, we have The Avengers instead.So our unlikely heroes team up together to defeat Thor's brother, Loki. Luckily, all of these overpowered world savers are used to having each other as company, PSYCHNOTREALLY. They all have pretty big egos, let's be honest, but we don't see just how big their egos are until they all share one movie together. Jump ahead, they have to learn how to cope with one another, and just barely tolerate each other in order to stop the world-destroying threat.There is some absolutely wonderful cinematography, put together by Seamus McGarvey. Did I mention how clever the script is? Joss Whedon poured his fricking essence into the pages of writing, and it pays off so very nicely. I don't feel like The Avengers was missing anything that ticked me off. I also have never been so excited for a sequel before in my life.

Another Action Movie,"When this movie first came out I was somewhat excited. I hadn't seen ratings like that very often (8.8 right off the bat), and I was fairly new to IMDb at the time too. Unfortunately, it really wasn't anything special.The plot itself is pretty lackluster. It's just an average action movie in terms of story. Sure, there's nothing really wrong with that, but nevertheless it wasn't very well-done.The characters are just the same as the plot: nothing special. Sure, we get lots of looks at how well they fight, as well as a little bit of arguing, but that's about it. The character development wasn't amazing in this movie. Sure, they had the other Marvel movies to develop the characters separately, but that's hardly an excuse not to put effort into this movie.The action, which is the only thing The Avengers contains, is all just fine. Everyone's just extremely overpowered, human or not, to an unrealistic level. Overdone fights aren't really my thing, considering how commonly we see them.Overall The Avengers is nothing special. Sure, it was risky for Joss Whedon to put all the Marvel characters into one universe, and he actually pulled it off, but giving points to this movie for that is like giving it points for it's creation. The character and plot were very average, and the action was rather un-amusing.

Exceeds Expectations,"In the days leading up to The Avengers release I was so excited that I could barely contain myself.

With fantastic visuals, incredible fight scenes and even some witty humor thrown in (some may think this weird but it fits in beautifully). The plot itself is not complex but is interesting and does ""The Avengers"" name justice.Still I think what made this movie so great is the movies that came before it. As soon as the movie starts you already have these characters you know, deep characters each with their own story-line.

Literally a block-buster,"It's yet another glossy Marvel fantasy which seems to divide opinion – so I think it's one of best average films I've ever seen. It's entertaining, noisy, violent, and you just know who's going to win; mind you, New York was left in ruins yet again. The Marvel plot should run that New Yorker's should just leave everything as it is to save time for the next alien foul-up. Can the producers re-use any of the cgi cartoon conflagration scenes to pad out the next movie?Bad god Loki forcibly gathers a force around him in order to take over Earth and get one over his brother the good god Thor. Meanwhile in the growing chaos Samuel L. Jackson is responsible for assembling a force of superheroes to save the planet: Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk, Black Widow, Thor and eventually Hawkeye. It's a shame Capt. America didn't get his moments readjusting to life in the 21st century, I. Man's slappable whimsicality was reduced, Hulk sure had some fun in his far too brief meeting with Loki, Johansson looked just as serious and good with her kit on. Personally there could have been more room for character interpolations and plot and less building-crunching battle at the end, but I suppose that's what appeals more to the kids. But I must admit that in the thick of it I was wondering where was Popeye and could he have polished the baddies all off a little quicker than this lot. And fancy a future US government signing off the building of a mammoth flying aircraft carrier – with teleportation maybe just around the corner the whole concept of travel – and battle – will be altered. I came away almost impressed at the style over substance brazenness of the film itself but very impressed with Tom Hiddleston's smooth performance as Loki; maybe an Eton education helps perfect acting with a cold heartless demeanour.I loved the after-credit ending section tying back in to the plot, and although if stripped of the cgi it's pretty simple fare I enjoyed it. Not a bad nor a great film - even if compared to Battleship; but it's barmy and just lively and fast enough to suspend belief for two hours.

A blast from Joss Whedon.,"So here it is. After nearly fifty years, The Avengers have finally made the transition from page to screen, and best of all, it does not manage to disappoint. Much of this is down to Joss Whedon and the pitch-perfect casting.At first, the choice of Whedon as director surprised me somewhat. I really like Whedon, don't get me wrong, but with a background in television and his most notable cinematic efforts being the screenplay for the first 'Toy Story' and the unfortunately overlooked 'Serenity', he struck me as an odd choice. But make no mistake, that even with millions more dollars at hand, Whedon fortunately remains true to himself; keeping humour in sight, with plenty of instantly quotable quips and wisecracks throughout. He is confident and assured with these treasured characters, managing to juggle all these superheroes (and one super ego).We're all used to (most of ) the cast members by now; Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Chris Evans as Captain America, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson, Tom Hiddleston as Loki; but we also have some new players in the form of Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye and Mark Ruffalo as Hulk. What is most brilliant is that all the actors impress. I was eagerly anticipating seeing Evans as Rogers again, after falling in love with his solo effort, but it was in fact Ruffalo who struck me the most. His portrayal as the tortured Bruce Banner was nuanced, believable and very human, applying emotion to a difficult role. Hiddleston was true pleasure as the villainous Loki, giving a fantastic performance and wonderfully delivering many great lines.One quibble I had was Hawkeye's lack of screen-time, but that can be ignored as I suspect he will either get a spin-off or have a larger role in the sequel.This is the very opposite to say Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy; instead of being dark, realistic and multi-layered, this is the very synthesis of a big, bright summer movie, a blast from start to finish with humour and large action sequences. While Loki's army were a bit too Transformers-esque for my liking, I still thoroughly enjoyed the film, and exited the cinema with a satisfied smile on my face. Overall, an excellent blockbuster which deserves the praise it's getting. All I want is for Whedon to the sequel.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

That forces these goofs to join forces and get serious.Loki escapes, opens the portal, aliens attack NY, the avengers respond and have to find a way to close the portal. But Fury wasn't entirely honest with them. He's up to something.Everything goes pretty much by the numbers. Loki is the star here by far. Of the heroes, Downey's character is the only somewhat memorable one. He manages to be a bit funny, cocky, but not too arrogant. Renner is pretty intense and interesting. Thor is likable. The other's don't do a whole lot. Jackson as always plays himself, or rather a caricature of himself. Why does he still get hired? The Avengers isn't as awesome as Thor nor as awful as Captain America. It's somewhere in between. Your standard summer blockbuster with serious CGI carnage a bit too reminiscent of some Transformers movie. We clearly don't need to see another movie with giant alien worms destroying skyscrapers, please. Whedon did his work and saved this from becoming some crappy Michael Bay clone. The script and dialog are alright. The whole idea just doesn't work all too well for me. All these ridiculous heroes-some human, others superhuman, others CGI, together. At least when it's all and said and done it's somewhat exhilarating but about 40 minutes too long. Intros are fine but we don't need that much of an intro let alone the obnoxious bickering amongst the main characters.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Marvel Does it Again,"I Watched ""Marvel's Avengers"" at the Cinema in 2D, I was amazed & excited.The cast, special effects, plot, action sequence are way beyond my expectations.""The Hulk"" played by Mark Raffalow is fantastic the looks very realistic comparing with the other previous Hulk movies. Of course I don't have anything wrong to say about this movie.All other characters have done a very good job. Loki's appearance is very well done by showing his cunning attitudes, villain looking face, my god I love him acting like that. Better than the appearance in the movie ""THOR"". Some reviews say the the movie has to experience in 2D, but I am not going to take a change, I will watch this in 3D too. But I hope that 2D is better than 3D though.All I have to say is ""WOW"".

Amazing effects and fun fight but don't know why all this fuss,Avengers is a movie that is must watch for everyone but still i don't get one thing.......why was all the plot so artificial.The fight sequence is beautiful and there are lot of awesome moments. I just wonder if such a technology was used properly. Until the end the whole system and everyone seems to be just acting to support some story which was terribly boring. none of the intelligent mind can grasp it positively. Everything was so much made up that it feels as if it was made just to maintain a length until the fight scenes can be filmed. Its terrible that the producer even invested in such a weak project. The effect with hulk are the main attraction. most of the characters in my opinion degraded their image as a superhero during UN-REQUIRED fight shots.For me this was a super enjoyable movie but i would love to see it using forward button. I declare it as a 'forward button' movie. its is watchable and interesting but it is like why why why all this that is you are doing...specially that man with one eye..limit of a grown up actor to do some insane artificial acting and bring disrespect.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Awesome and Entertaining,"Just got back from watching this movie. This was a very entertaining movie. There are a lot of spots in the movie that refer to other superhero movies before the hero even comes into play. I love the fact that if you were able to watch all these movies, the movie ties it all together. People, I highly recommend that you watch both Iron Man movies, Captain America, and Thor before you watch this. It makes it much more enjoyable. You can still watch it without watching them, it will just make much more enjoyable. Also, I feel this movie was well balanced and engaging. HULK and Stark had me laughing.

THIS is how you spent 200 million on a movie,"I am a huge Marvel geek, so if you are not 100% into Marvel or superhero movies, you should take the following with a grain of salt: Avengers is everything I ever dreamed of and lived for. It is like I was a child again, watching in awe with my mouth wide open.Whedon nailed nearly every single scene. He made every superhero movie which is already out look very outdated. This movie is 140 minutes maybe and 130 minutes are money shots. I have to find new superlatives and words are still not enough if I wanted to describe my feelings. And after seeing the trailer and the pictures, I already had high expectations.The charisma of Captain America, the wild brutality of the Hulk, the majesty of Thor, it was all there.

Avengers Assemble - Review,"There are several reasons why this film fails as something a person should ever watch more than once. Firstly, there is a major lack of plot twists or changes to the story that might keep you on the edge of your seat; everything about the plot is insultingly linear and predictable and follows the most basic structure of 'goods versus evil' with a predictable injection of basic virtue and morals - in this case 'unity' and 'teamwork.' are clearly highlighted.Secondly, the film manages to insult your most basic intelligence by showcasing unnecessary antics that are nothing more than fantastical nonsense. Think of an action scene and describe it in words; this is a way to bypass the lush graphics and realize that: a) while Iron Man is in space and is flying away from the portal, he somehow changes direction in the vacuum of space and returns through the portal. The Hulk, who cannot fly, jumps a few hundred feet in the air and catches Iron Man before bouncing off to safety. b) Nick Fury is violently gunned down, dusts himself down in time to evacuate the base. c) Captain America is shot down, dusts himself down and carries on. d) Black Widow, who also is incapable of flight, gives Captain America psychic eyeballing to communicate she wants to jump ten times her height into the air by bouncing off your shield so I can hijack a space-orcs flying motorcycle which is speeding towards us from a distance.One could argue that it is not meant to be realistic and is mere entertainment. What becomes salient about Avengers Assemble is that there are no rules. The heroes never get stuck, never get challenged, they're never in any recognizable danger, there are no puzzles, any challenge is overcome easily and characters do as they please. No rules means no mystery, no interest and nothing to keep you on the edge of your seat.Finally, the antagonist was hardly foreboding to ever present a sense of danger or worry against so many heroes, all equal protagonists, all dreadfully dull - especially Bruce Banner.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Avengers = EPIC!,"The mere idea of bringing all the Super-heroes together made this movie a hit, it was epic indeed. It totally lives up to your expectations. Some scenes in this movie are unexpectedly hilarious. Everyone in the cast did a great job. Mark Ruffalo was a excellent replacement for Edward Norton, everyone was disappointed by Hulk's character not being played by Edward (including me), But I'd say Mark was up to the mark. If you're looking for a break from your daily-routine stressed life, go to the theaters and watch this movie. The Avengers has all the ingredients needed for a Hit movie.

"Good, but why is Cobie Smulders in this?","One of the best super hero movies I have seen, but it is only that. It isn't supposed to have any deeper meaning or advanced plot. This is a movie mainly for comic fans. I'm not much of a comic reader, but I still enjoyed it.There was a couple of things I couldn't quite ignore though. I thought the invasion was pretty terrible. The aliens sent in only a couple of worm things that contained a few alien CGI soldiers and bumped into a couple of buildings. It was not exactly an effective way to take earth. The second thing that kind of annoyed me was the aliens. Just to keep it PG-13, there is no gore, and the aliens are nothing but CGI bad guys.I was worried there wouldn't be enough screen time for each of the super heroes, considering there were so many, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that they all had their roles and input. What really annoyed me though, was Cobie Smulders. What an unnecessary character to throw into the movie! She did nothing of importance AT ALL! I don't know if Cobie's character is in the comics, but it's still just annoying to see her on screen. It's just a cheap business trick to have more stars in the movie and of course adding a fine movie to her resume. Every time she was on screen, it just reminded me that the film industry is just a business like everything else.I'd give it 8.0",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A decent movie assembled,"Avengers is a movie I have been waiting to see for 30 years. With the style of the Xmen & Spiderman films, in addition to the Hulk, Iron Man, Thor and Captain American films; it was pretty clear what type of movie this was going to be. Big, loud, slick, exciting, and light on story. Joss Whedon's influence has made for a much better movie, his witty and sometimes intelligent screenplay lifts this from a middle of the road Marvel movie to something that is a great popcorn movie. All the performances are spot-on, and the photography and cgi beautiful. This is very much a movie for the fans, but anyone can enjoy it. Don't expect a complex interwoven plot, but a classic good guys v bad guys movie. Loads of fun, so leave your brain at the door and dive in!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
the avengers gave me my very first nerdgasm,"Please if you haven't watched it yet, don't read my review or any other review, just go and see it!if you are not into marvel movies, if you haven't watched every other previous installment of the avengers, you won't find this movie very appealing to you. But, if you have watched every previous movie, if you like the characters, then prepare yourself, because Joss Whedon has put together one of the best movies ever made by man!!thats the thing about this movie, its not really a movie on its own, i mean, it expects you to know the characters, and thats just what it has to be. This is not really a movie but a cinematic experience. If the other marvel movies are as getting to know somebody, flirting with that somebody, foreplay, the avengers is sex. Thats the best way i can put it.You can really fell that Whedon knows and loves this characters, because he takes the core elements of each of the avengers personalities and uses them for building the problems, the humor, the companionship. I have to say this is the best team assembly i have seen. This movie has the best humor, the best action, the best acting, the best characterization, the best everything.For the first time, i felt a nerdgasm, I'm not lying or exaggerating, i felt it.Any person who criticizes this movie did not get it at all, did not get the point of it, because the avengers will change cinema forever, i mean it.I love good movies, i do, i know a lot of movies and I'm not a person that watches only Hollywood movies, but i can say this. The avengers is one of the best experiences i have ever had in my whole life. i will see it at least 3 times more",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What's wrong with Americans?,"Okay, I'm expecting a full-packed action film but instead I get a more drama than action film. I'm not saying it's bad, it's just not as I expected in an 'ultimate' superheroes movie. Ultimate as more superheroes = more awesomeness.However, most of this film is more about battle of ego than saving the world, actually their ego are the real threats to this world. Except Hulk which seems there purely for action, the others need some push and a good person must die, like saving the world is not enough cause and a retaliation/revenge gives better reason. So some reel time is waste for this 'superhero drama' instead for action. I kind of disappointed with these 'selfish' superheroes. Luckily, Hulk gives several comic relief and save the movie.The action is slowly build up towards the end (too slow for me) but it pays off in the final battle. Not as spectacular as I expected but in the end it provides just enough reason why there must be a team like Avengers in this Marvel Universe.The thing that disturbed me the most is those Americans, those people who happen to be in the wrong time at the wrong place - well, not only in this film but also others like the Transformers series, etc. The city streets has become the battle ground and those mortal, ordinary people still there in the streets, watching very closely like it's just a parade or a flash mob and deliberately provide themselves as collateral damages. What's wrong with these people? Is every Americans so stupid or have suicidal tendencies? Audience can except the collateral damages, the panicked citizens, people runs for their life in the 1st 3 minutes of the battle, but after that the filmmaker should simply have a scene of these people watching from afar, behind road blocks with police guard, peeking from a secure hide-out etc.The execution is good but the script could be improved. We already know they are superheroes and there are already prequels for each character so instead of taking lots of time talking out of their differences, let these characters solve their differences in battle over battle before the final one. Lots of battle, lots of action's awesomeness. Therefore, my grin could last for days. They also failed to explain why Hulk can transform from an uncontrollable destroyer into a cooperative teammate in no time which feels like I miss some important scenes.The use of CGI - after several 'heavy CGI' films - is starting to become dull. It's like the film maker has no other choice to awe audience than using bigger explosion, more fatal destructions. Film like ""chronicles"" provide better use of CGI for enhancing the story while not as grande as this. So overall, I give it 6.5/10. Sorry for my English.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Unequivocally the GREATEST Comic-Hero/Action movie to date!,"First of all....WOW! I saw it in IMAX 3D and it was just amazing. The story, the acting, the tension, the character relationships, comic relief. Flawless. Just a work of art. I personally think that all of the Marvel movies in the last decade have been great. Movies directed by true comic fans. All leading up to this one moment in cinema history. And they did not let us down:) It's so ironic that most of the ""modern"" action movies are so far fetched. Fake. Pop hype served with sex and a big dose of ""let's come up with a really crazy story to top last years block-buster"". It get's old. This movie, somehow, has a sense of honesty and realism. No doubt, ""super-hero"" magic. But the story and connection with the previous individual hero films just made it all come together in a way that makes you feel like you're watching a great flashback of ancient mythos unfold.

"Kinda boring, no, yaaaawwwwn, very boring! Zzzzzzzzzzzz","How I would love to have championed Joss Whedon for this. But alas, no.The Avengers is not a great movie. Avengers is a boring movie.OK, I saw it in 3D. The only other film I've seen in 3D was Avatar and - this may also indicate to you I'm not a movie snoot - I rather thought Avatar was OK, unlike many who say it's awful. You would be right therefore, to infer that the novelty of 3D hasn't exactly had a chance to wear thin on me yet.Let's just get the 3D out of the way: for me, it was like watching a holographic projection, very unreal. Often there were only 2, maybe just 3 planes of focus and sometimes this made the focus too oddly focused!, e.g. a wobbling briefcase in the foreground that looked like something out of Toy Story. Also, some of the action with Johanssen is frantic CGI cartoony acrobatics, and in 3D this just looks even more of a mess, anything but exciting! I was cautioned not to see in 3D - that person was right. The print isn't compensated for by the darkening effect of the glasses. I think it affected me too. Eye-fatigue, plus the combination of how those glasses make the film so dark, plus a major major flaw in the film, caused me to give up on consciousness and spare my eyeballs more than once.Yes, in 3D at least, this film is too dark to see what's going on. Detail becomes elusive and the 3D focus only allows you to see one or two parts of the screen - everything else is often deliberately way out-of-focus. This makes the film visually uninteresting (especially for us 'autistic' background viewers ;-).And the major major flaw.. Oh, I might have already let that slip: this movie is boring! Surely I can't be so bored that easily by a film I've never seen before! It's impossible! Avengers: yes, there's some showy effects that may impress those that can get off on over 2 hours of blam blam blam but me: yaaaawwn! Honestly, I was expecting to enjoy The Avengers, especially since I kinda liked the Thor movie (nothing to do with Portman, who does very little for me). And also, my total non-appreciation for The Avengers goes against what I'd hoped... that I could say something great about this film, and be able to champion Joss Whedon for a new era of Sci-Fi movies. Serenity was good, very good - albeit with forgivably TV-movie quality. Unfortunately, it seems, budget wasn't the limiting factor and I've now lost interest.Duncan Jones, do you hear?",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Avengers Assemble! *Spoiler*,"I have to say this film was brilliant from start to finish, the characters were awesome and the action was mind blowing.

A great mix of action from the air battles to the streets below. It was great seeing Thor and Hulk battle it out again being the last time we saw them together was in TIHR TV movie from 1988!I think it was faithful to the comics and brought the comic strip to life and I can only applaud the efforts of the film crew for bringing together the characters that I grew up and became so fond of.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My expectations were incredibly high and THE AVENGERS went above and beyond what I was expecting,"I should start this review by saying that I am a massive comic book fan and have been for as long as I can remember. Whenever a new comic book movie comes out I get very excited and am either satisfied, more than satisfied, disappointed or mildly annoyed when I actually see the damn thing. The Marvel Cinematic Universe (Earth-199999) has been building steadily since ""Iron Man"" (more than satisfied) and has been coming along nicely brick by brick with ""The Incredible Hulk"" (yet to see), ""Iron Man 2"" (satisfied), ""Thor"" (satisfied), ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" (more than satisfied) adding more and more detail and continuity to the mountain. We have now reached ""The Avengers"" (more than satisfied) which climbs to the peak of the mountain to take it's place as the epitome of an awesome movie. I went into ""The Avengers"" excited, disbelieving that this was actually happening and very, very scared about how much I would enjoy it due to the MASSIVE hype surrounding the film. I came out in a state of great pleasure and I thank the stars that Marvel Studios chose cult television genius Joss Whedon to direct and write it. Why did I love this movie so much?1. Joss Whedon brought the spirit, skill, humour and knowledge that this film needed. His previous works that I have seen, ""Dr. Horrible's Sing- A-Long Blog"" and ""Firefly"" prove that he can create great drama and many memorable lines both meaningful and hilarious. His twenty-five issue run on ""Astonishing X-Men"" proves that he knows Marvel characters very well and can write great superheroes with very human flaws.2. The actors were downright perfect for their roles and each one got an equal role to play. Robert Downey Jr.(Iron Man/Tony Stark),Chris Evans(Captain America/Steve Rogers), Chris Hemsworth (Thor, God of Thunder) and Samuel L. Jackson (Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.) have already proved in previous films that they are great choices for Marvel's movies. Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow/Natasha Romanov) got just enough screen time in ""Iron Man 2"" to show she was a GOOD choice for the character, but in this she proves to be the best we could possibly ask for. Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye/Clint Barton) appeared for five seconds in ""Thor"" to shoot an arrow or two so he obviously proved nothing in that movie, but in this one he proves to be a superb choice for one of my long-time favourite Marvel characters. Mark Ruffalo (The Hulk/Bruce Banner) is the only main newcomer in this film due to Edward Norton and Marvel disagreeing with each other after ""The Incredible Hulk"" and proves to be a perfect choice for Bruce Banner, certainly better than Eric Bana in the horrible outing ""The Hulk"". Tom Hiddleston (Loki, God of Mischief) proved excellent in ""Thor"" and continues his excellence in this. Clark Gregg (Agent Phil Coulson) plays the only character created specifically for these films and has become a fan favourite through his brief appearances in previous Marvel pictures. Agent Coulson really gets his chance to shine in this film and shine he does.3. It set things up very nicely for future entries in the series.4. The character interactions were incredible and all of the heroes and villains were smartly developed, something you can be guaranteed in a Joss Whedon production.5. It looked great, the costumes, the fight scenes e.t.c were all very well designed.6. It had heart, something you don't get in most blockbusters.7. Stan Lee's cameo.8. Post credits sequence.9. Harry Dean Stanton's cameo.10. The hilarious lines, such as ""Puny God""These are just a few of the many reasons ""The Avengers"" worked so well for me and all in all I have to say that my expectations were incredibly high and ""The Avengers"" went above and beyond what I was expecting.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Finally, a Film  that Lives Up to Its Hype and High Expectations!","The anticipation for this film has been building up so many months since the showing of the solo movies about each of the heroes that comprise this superstar group -- Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, and finally, Captain America. These individual films were all very good on their own, so very expectations are foisted on this special film that would unite all of them in one big adventure. Even though I am out of town now, that did not stop me from catching this film with some Marvel comics geeks. And for once, a film has come that fulfills it's advanced hype, and then some!The film follows how these heroes were called together and assembled by Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. to retrieve a blue high-energy cube called the Tesseract stolen by the Asgard god Loki. It was fun how the film depicted the clash of their individual big egos of the heroes, and they did not really get along with each other right away, as would be expected. There is humor along with the high-intensity action. I felt though that some ""funny"" scenes involving Tony Stark were too self- indulgent for comfort in a ""team"" film like this.It was great to see all of these heroes get their fair share of screen time, even the lesser known ones, like the super-archer Hawkeye (the very busy Jeremy Renner) and the amazing fighter Black Widow (stunningly portrayed by the beautiful Scarlett Johansson). The others played their characters as they did in their solo movies, and amazingly, they all worked so well together here: the imperious Thor by Chris Hemsworth, the patriotic Captain America by Chris Evans and the haughty Tony Stark / Iron Man by Robert Downey Jr. People doubted if Marc Ruffalo could take Ed Norton's place as Dr. Bruce Banner and the Hulk, but Ruffalo actually imbued this character with a unique charm previously unseen in other incarnations. The Hulk received the loudest cheers from the crowd! Even the ever-loyal Agent Coulsen (Clark Gregg) gets his moment to shine.This film is a definite must-see not only for all fans of Marvel comics, but for fans of action/fantasy films in general. This is real triumph for director Josh Whedon.  Don't miss the extra scene included in the middle of the final credits for it will surely get you excited.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Record Setting Movie for the Power of Marketing,"If ever there were an example of everything wrong with major movie review sites and Hollywood movies today, this film takes the cake over all others.To start, this film was monstrously, overbearingly advertised to every single medium containing pixels or paper in the world for months leading up to it's release; including the premise of the multiple years of collective Marvel movies leading up to this single ""epic"" superhero mash-up that would ""blow all other superhero movies away"" known as The Avengers. There was so much hype surrounding this movie, it became almost impossible not to see some kind of advertised praise of how epic it would be. Then came the IMDb movie reviews...Within the weeks leading up to the release, as well as multiple weeks beyond the premiere, you would be hard pressed to find any review that wasn't at or near a perfect 10/10. It quickly became apparent that these were paid reviewers, as all the reviews seemed to have subtle words, structure, and nuances in common, along with an extremely strange hyper-in-depth biographical portfolio of personal knowledge for the historical work of every writer, producer, director, musician, camera operator and even extras in the movie. All extremely uncommon knowledge to be so readily described in every person's review to support this movie. Last, was the extreme repetition of descriptions such as ""spellbinding"", ""breath- taking"", ""edge-of-your-seat"", etc.However...Once biting the bullet and paying money to finally see it, I almost laughed out loud! How in the world a movie with: horribly stiff acting, nearly no plot beyond ""bad guy wants to destroy the world, we must put aside our differences and unite"" cliché, oddly outdated CGI, terrible 'Batman & Robin (1997)' style punch-lines and puns, surprisingly really low-budget looking costumes and props, and uneven main character screen-time (aka The Avengers is 85% ""The Ironman Show"", 10% ""The Thor Show"", 5% everyone else) ever, ever received any Review Score over 5/10 absolutely blows my mind.Don't let the advertising, infallible Marvel die-hards, or paid reviews fool you; this movie is the 2012 version of all those 90's Superhero Sequel attempted cash-grab franchise movies we grew to hate until their demise (Batman Forever/Batman & Robin, The Phantom, etc). Ironman (1) and especially Batman Begins restored faith in the whole, ""Revamp the modern Superhero movie the way it should have been"" genre... and now it's spiraling right back to bland, dull, blatant cash grabs; with this movie the king of them all.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Hulk Smash, Iron Man Fly, Thor Grimace, Humans Run!","RATING: See it in theaters (Rating System: ""See it in theaters,"" ""Wait for the instant download,"" ""Don't waste your time"")Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the half-brother of Thor has returned to Earth to pave the way for a wave of destruction at the hands of evil aliens. But secret agency S.H.E.I.L.D has been preparing by analyzing the mysterious Tesseract – an blue-glowing cube of unharnessed infinite power. Loki steals the Tesseract and it is up to Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), leader of S.H.I.E.L.D to pull together a team of the world's first super heroes to defeat Loki and return the Tesseract from whence it came. The heroes are known as The Avengers and they are Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner).The Avengers is a recipe for disaster. It is an ensemble cast of players, each of whom is a third magnitude star in his (or her) own right. Whenever you get this many egos in the room at one time, there is bound to be in-fighting. And in fact, this is what happens in the movie. The heroes can't get along. They jockey for alpha-male status, only to find that they are equals, each with his own unique strength. And yet, both on the screen and in reality, they find a balance. Each actor brings his own ingredients to the mix. And each actor plays his (or her) character to perfection; as if it were their own film.Another problem is backstory – there is a lot of it. Some of these characters have been brought to the collective consciousness in their own debut films of the last couple of years (Iron Man, The Hulk, Thor, and Captain America). If you've seen their films then you have an idea of who they are already. The other two needed a bit more introduction and it was skillfully interlaced with the action.And then there's the problem of interaction – 6 main players plus Fury and Loki implies 28 different relationships. And that's a hard act to pull off in just 142 minutes.Still, writer/director Joss Whedon (""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" ""Serenity"") pulls it all off with apparent ease. The story is relentless in its pace and still fills us in on who the characters are and what they contribute. There's an amazing scene when the characters are at their lowest point (close friends are dead, the team is dispersed) and they expose each other's weaknesses. The souls of our heroes are left bare. This gives us nowhere to go but up.And indeed, up we go. To beat their combined foe, the team must pull together: each member using their special gifts to turn back an invading force.But as amazing as the film is, there are problems. The last climactic scenes are a series of improbable battles in the heart of New York City. Mind you, these battles are carried out with much more precision than the garbage whirlwind of the Transformers films. But, due to the PG-13 nature of the film, we find little bloodshed and a lot of tumbling skyscrapers.Which brings me to the biggest problem I have with the film: just how strong are these super heroes? Hulk, besides being hulking, is apparently impervious to direct bullet and missile fire. Captain America can apparently withstand the full force of alien hand grenades. Iron Man takes a licking and keeps on ticking. And Thor, with his mighty hammer seems to be able to stop anything, but still goes flying when monsters whip their tails. And for the other two (who remind me of the Professor and Marianne from Gilligan's Island – ""and the rest""), when there is a battle they are sent off to do reconnaissance or direct traffic lest they be trampled or crushed. They may be more of a liability than they are worth.Finally, I want to talk about the unsung hero of the Marvel universe: Stan Lee. Lee has a cameo appearance in every Marvel action movie. He is held as sort of the progenitor of modern hero lore. As such, he is a special icon in the comic book (and now movie) realm. All legends spring from his fount.

Not sure why anyone would come here and read some reviews about it, i mean let us face it, you already made your decisions to go and see it, you just want to make sure !!a hugely marketed movie like this will always attract people to go and see it, it is very hard to ignore all the big fuss and all those giant billboards and adds of it everywhere !!I went in with huge expectations, and it had to be said that the movie did not let me down,however, i believe it is way too overrated and over hyped ! the movie starts out very slowly, and for the first hour or so, i felt some boredom creeping in, or was it my exuberant mood and impatience for the action to starts ? there was just too much stretch of boring speech and slow scenes of the gathering of the Avengers in the first hour or so.I was expecting a roller coaster of action / adventure scenes from start to finish and i guess i was slammed in the face by the slow built up in the beginning. my two younger daughters "" 5 and 6 "" certainly got bored and fidgety, which added to my frustration.Having said that, the movie is a success in what its trying to do, which is gathering all those super heroes together in one film, it was entertaining and enjoyable over the whole run. I just thought that the plot was nothing special, just your average cartoonish plot of an evil villain who wants to rule the world, the serious dialog involving the main plot was boring and empty with no interest in it, however, when the funny scenes and dialog jump in, its really enjoyable and pure fun.Each of the characters had an almost equal screen time, although, the roles seems uneven with the highest importance going to Iron man, and a lot of time went into trying to explore the Black Widow and Hawkeye relationship but failing in adding any strong background about those two characters, did not feel or care much about them.the Hulk was also sort of put on the side, not clear what his involvement was into the team, supposedly he knows much about the Gama radiation, but i was puzzled with him, at times he was completely out of control and not distinguishing between the heroes and Villains, and other times, he was completely submissive to his fellow super heroes.It was clear that iron man was running the show, maybe the leader some how, which i liked since he is among my favorites, his quarrels with Captain America were fun and there seemed liked a power struggle between the two !!Thor was another character put on the side, did not have a big impact other than his brother being the villain !! Sameul L Jackson's character Nick Fury was the most annoying as the leader of the Avengers, his speeches and his overall role were useless and annoying, very frustrating and if i were a super hero, i wouldn't join a team that he leads. just an empty character.certain parts of the plot were lame and silly, like when a certain character in the movie was killed, and his death was the ultimate reason for the Avengers to finally join together was a bit too corny.Now the good parts !! because once the action starts, it really is brilliant !! some very impressive visuals and solid action scenes with the involvement of the Avengers, especially the final fight in the end, it was superb, although not entirely original "" some similarities to the last Transformers movie "", still very enjoyable and the kids certainly were impressed and glued to the big screen with excitement.So in Summary, the Avengers is not the best movie ever made, and not in anyway a masterpiece, however, it is entertaining and is original as the first film with multiple superheroes in it. the first half gets a 6.5 out of 10, but then the 2nd half of the movie gets a solid 9 !! my 8 year old son says its a 10 !! :)Moebardi.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Another over-the-top cartoon for Hollywood to pander to...,"I didn't like The Hulk movies, they were awful, both in story and execution. Ironman was excellent but Ironman 2 dropped off. Captain America was entertaining if a bit far fetched. Thor was ludicrous. I didn't hold up much hope for Avengers Assemble but i still saw, and enjoyed it, even if Scarlett Johansen shouldn't be within 1000feet of these movies ever. Jeremy Renner and Robert Downing Jr saved this film. Renner is a top notch action star in the making. That aside, the Avengers is beautiful to watch, great effects, decent story but the ending was lame compared to the build-up and, having watched how Christopher Nolan realistically and magnificently does his Batman movies, this isn't even a close second to them for me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A movie made by geek community for geeks,"Anyone gave 5 to 10 stars for this absurdity who is past 18th birthday , not a comic book publisher Marvel Fanboy and does have a girlfriend please raise your hand.No one ? Thought so. The movie is atrocious. There is a plot a plus compared Transformers movies but it is so simplistic and full of tropes , deux-ex-machinas ( I lost count how many times Loki's magic staff was used to explain everything and advance story from brain washing to destroy portal opening device ) , stereotypes , predictability and cheap juvenile PG-13 jokes it becomes a parody. I wonder that was the intention. Self mocking with movie concept , characters , genre etc. Because there is no way this movie goes unpredictable or might surprise you. Ending credits might have said ""From producers of Scary Movie"" or ""Meet the Spartans"" Final CGI explosion filled fight scene (another parallel to Transformers movies ) against alien invaders where no one was harmed due to rating was so messy with headache inducing 3D scenery you either had to get out of theater for fresh air or close your eyes and ears ( I did former ) The result is box office inflated animation due to marketing hype. Except CGI special effects overuse it has little cinematic quality. Actors try to make something out of their characters but child like character material gives them little chance on that.Comic book fan boys. Please stop comparing your live action stuff with Oscar winning material. You display your ignorance and make yourselves ridiculous. Cinema does not revolve around you. I am glad that you got your live action clip but for the rest %99 of us living on this planet who do not know know or familiar with resource material The Avengers was badly edited , predictable (and sometimes cringe worthy) movie.

The Avengers Initiative is a successful one,"The Avengers is what we all dream about on reading those superhero comics and watching the movies. We always would love the concept of having all superheroes assembled and fighting for justice and that if such a thing happens, nothing ever could happen to our planet Earth. However, rational thinking would suggest putting them all in one basket would make movie making quite difficult since the logistics of bringing an all conquering villain along with the bonding of the superheroes would change the dynamic of the superhero movie concept and can be a double edged sword if not handled properly. Certainly they cannot make a movie where the heroes are summoned to fight evil and they come and finish the job and they leave. It has to be more complicated than that for the movie to succeed and it is.Hats off to the director and writers of this movie since they not only have a villain who is manipulative, evil and quite powerful with his own army who can provide quite a challenge to the heroes but also have handled well the tricky scenarios of putting all the heroes in the same room. Hulk, Iron Man and Thor are all used to fighting outside of the law as vigilantes in their own movies. These three would normally have no problem working together. The bonding between Ironman and Hulk was depicted aptly since they are both scientists and vigilantes. However, the presence of Captain America, black widow and hawk-eye, who are all used to following orders and work for the law, within this mix creates a lot of tension in the air when they start interacting. The blame games and one-liners are ON and believe me, the one liners from RDJ are really cracking. All this makes for a compelling first half.Obviously, the second half is all about how they work together to destroy the enemy. Its predictable, but its fun and visually awesome as well. Visually its a spectacle and must be watched in 3D. The movie is not without its cons though. For one, I really thought, with Loki as the villain, Thor should have had a better role to play. Unfortunately he was severely under utilized. Scarlett is given an expansive role (I should say her body in that tight fighting outfit is awesome. She is hot) which sometimes even outshines Captain America and the rest.Watch it. Even if its not awesome or amazing or whatever, you will certainly enjoy the ride.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Now THIS Is How To Make an Ensemble Film,"Marvel studios took a leap of faith in handing this project to the brilliant Joss Whedon. After all, his only other film that got a cinema release (Serenity) failed to even recoup its budget at the box office. They must have seen something in him, though, because this film is, in every sense of the word, Epic!It could so easily have just been Iron Man And His Sidekicks, but Whedon's fine grasp of characters gives everyone involved their fair share of screen time without the film dragging for a second. Tony Stark / Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) is all cock-sure and swagger. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is every inch the demi-god that has Earth ""under his protection"". Steve Rogers / Captain America (Chris Evans) is a man so far out of his own time he feels alien to the world he now lives in. Most enigmatic of the group is Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow (Scarlett Johansen), who is a master manipulator and reveals only as much as she wants you to know, and Cliff Barton / Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) who is both mentor and partner to her. Their history is one that needs its own film!The real joy of the piece, though, is Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / The Hulk. Banner lives an isolated life, barely keeping ""the other guy"" in check, when Nick Fury sends Black Widow to recruit him. In a nice twist, it is Banner who is needed, not Hulk. Ruffalo is, by far and with all due respect to Eric Bana and Ed Norton, the best Banner AND Hulk to date and is given 2 of the films most memorable moments.Tom Middleston chews up the scenery as Loki, every bit as evil as Thor is good, with a plan for each of The Avengers in turn.Samuel L Jackson is given more to do as Nick Fury than ever before. He is the master control of The Avengers Initiative, so confident in each of his heroes he is willing to defy orders from his superiors.Visually stunning with great character developments, awesome special effects and a breathtaking pace, you never feel the 2 hr 10 minute running time. Popcorn will be left behind as you laugh and cheer through this ride.With the obligatory Stan Lee Cameo (although he is not the best cameo in the film) and Joss Whedon's trademark sucker-punch both in place, Avengers Assemble (as it is known in the UK) is by far the best superhero film to date.And the sequel? Will someone please put Joss Whedon on retainer? Now!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I was expecting more,"Based on the hype, I expected The Avengers to be one of those classic comic book movies that leave you breathless and amazed. Helmed by Joss Whedon, lead up to by several other comic book movies, I really thought this would be amazing.But it's not amazing, it's good. It's about Iron Man good, which puts it a notch above Thor, a notch below Captain America, and several notches above Iron Man II and the Incredible Hulk.There's just not a lot to it. Captain America was a good movie because it delved into the character, but here the movie rarely goes deeper than the occasional witticism. The only character theme is some squabbling, but this comes across as kids on a playground (although it is entertaining to see the movie play the ""what superhero could beat what superhero game""), and resolves itself perfunctorily. This is not what I expect from Joss Whedon; it's what I would have expected from Whedon directly after he made the original Buffy the Vampire Slayer movie.This is not to say that the movie is not enjoyable. It does have some cool special effects here and there and it moves along at a quick pace. The performances are generally good; I particularly liked Mark Ruffalo's laid-back Hulk. It's got some very cute moments sprinkled in, although they feel a little lost among the endless battles.It's a good movie, and if you want a fun popcorn flick this would be a good choice, but it's not a classic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A simple, fun, well-made summer movie","Here's a simple, fun, well-made summer movie. It's not great by any measure, nor does it ever try to be. What it does have is a director who understands that the source material is essentially comic book fluff. None of these characters have the depth that Batman or the X-Men do, but they do have cool powers and cool personalities that make for a decent story and some great action set pieces.The most epic of these sequences takes place in – you'll never guess, never, not in a milllion years – New York City! While the scene lacks originality in location, it does make up for it in sheer excitement. Iron Man goes rocketing around town in spectacular aerial battles with the Chitauri, who are as disposable as the Foot Soldiers from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Hawkeye sits on a perch on top of a building and casually snipes more Chitauri out of the air with his bow and arrow. The Hulk, well, he smashes. His chaotic leaping and random crushing of the puny aliens is spectacular to watch.

"Great movie for Marvel! One of my favorite Marvel movies of all-time! Thank you, Marvel and Joss Whedon for making such an awesome Marvel superhero flick!","The Avengers is a great movie and I think it's because of what they wanted to do with this film in Phase One of Marvel's cinematic universe and this movie pays off quickly.The action is just amazing and the final fight at the end is just top-notch. You already know what the plot is about so I don't have to go over it, but I will say that the story was light hearted and dark at the same time and you had some humor. The ending fight was the longest fight scene ever shown in this film.Robert Downey Jr is great as Iron Man and he does get a lot of screen time. Chris Evans plays Captain America and he does an amazing job, Chris Hemsworth and Jeremy Renner were both good as Thor and Hawkeye and they have done a very interesting job with their characters. Mark Ruffalo was cool as Bruce Banner / The Hulk and he does motion capture for the Hulk and it was really great to see him as a superhero. Scarlett Johannson plays Black Widow / Natasha Romanoff and she could not done better in this film, but the one person who really was great is Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Thor's brother and he makes a good villain. James Spader is gonna do better as the title character, Ultron in the upcoming sequel in the 2015 Marvel Studios film, ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"", which will be released this Friday on May 1st, 2015 and it is really cool to hear and see him as Ultron.Aaron Taylor-Johnson is going to rock as Quicksilver, but I think Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen's sister, Elizabeth, is hot as Scarlet Witch and she's gonna do great in that part, but Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury is good in the screen time he has in this film, but he only has a cameo or small part in the new Avengers movie, which I will review on Friday May 1st, 2015 and I think it's going to be a good film to start off the summer 2015 movie season.The visual effects are really impressive and really cool in this movie, especially The Hulk in this film. The music by Alan Silvestri is fantastic and amazing. I could not believe the music that I heard in this film and it was amazing to hear it. The film's running time feels like it's three hours long, but it is only 2 hours and 42 minutes long, so the movie moves on very quickly.Overall, I love THE AVENGERS and I am giving it an 8 / 10. Marvel has outdone themselves with this film and they will continue to outdo themselves with other future Marvel movies and it's not like every day that a four-year plan pays off with such praise and hype, but this paid off wonderfully.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"A very solid action/superhero flick, at best","Now I'm always getting a ton of hate for my opinion on The Avengers, so I'm prepared for many people to disagree with me. To start off, I am a huge Marvel fan, have been since I was young, so I'm not someone going in without a clue.Avengers is a solid superhero movie, with superb acting from much of the cast (it's fairly unanimous Ruffalo and Downey Jr. stole the show), great visuals, and terrific action choreography. But I still believe it to be overrated, and that is when people jump out at me. I'm not saying it's a bad film, I definitely enjoyed the viewing, especially in theatre. I couldn't really see myself caring to see it again though, not to say I would never; I just don't have a strong urge to. I am still excited for the sequel, there's no doubt about that, it will most likely be more of the same, and enjoyable.The thing about Avengers, and all of the other Marvel Studios productions (Thor, Captain America, Iron Man series) is that I don't feel they do what Christopher Nolan's Batman series has accomplished - and that is transcend the superhero genre. There is so much emotion and depth to both Batman Begins and even more so The Dark Knight, that Avengers could not even hold a candle to them. I suppose you could argue that would be due to the fact that the source material might be better for the Batman films, but I still feel the overall atmosphere of the Marvel Studios movies are less character development, more poppy in your face action sequences and quirky one liners. Again, that is not to say that is a terrible thing, it just doesn't bring Avengers, or any of the others up past 'good' for me, they do not reach great. Some people argue that the character development is great, and although I will agree that it's much better in The Avengers than any of the other Marvel films - because it had to be - it still doesn't reach compelling to me, just entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I did not want to watch this movie when i saw the trailer. Unfortunately i read Reviews and got misled by this high rating on IMDb. I expected much but i got an average action movie. The movie was not entertaining by profoundness. It was an 2 1/2 hour orgy of visual fireworks. This may be awesome for under aged persons but this definitely is not satisfying an audience that wants a story, good character description and most important a movie which is not completely foreseeable.IMDb should consider that their rating system lacks crucial information about the age of the Reviewers.

Another mediocre superhero movie,"I couldn't wait to see th Avengers. I thought that it would be on the same level as the Iron Man movies, Thor and Captain America. Sadly its more on par with the two Hulk movies instead. I have to admit that I am a fan of superheroes but I really wasn't into the Avengers as the cartoons contains too many whiny characters, well the movie is no different. There is too much preaching by Nick Fury, Captain America is too angry (angrier than the Hulk in fact), way too much Tony Stark and too much exposition about science that we really don't care about. The only characters that really shine on screen are Black Widow (wonderful kick ass fight screens, woman with power without superpowers), Hawkeye, Thor, Loki (until he starts getting boring) and Agent Colson. Joss Whedon usually knows how to temper his characters better but in this movie he really put together some awful dialog. Yes some of the jokes were funny but in between there were long periods of just boring stuff. It's too bad I know this will make a lot of money but it could have been so much better. It could have been a real classic but instead its not worth viewing more than once.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The plot of the story was hard to understand of whats going on. I really don't get it way this movie has high rating i mean 8.4 thats just rotten its should be around 4.5 around there. This movie is sooooooo boring that the action was so cheap and yea the acting was not bad but what killed it was hardly action and superheros as well as the plot. This to me is like transformers at the end when they fight the wired vilans or evil robots and robot fish lol. what a joke this is so mad boring. no offense but this movie is horrible its soo blahhh just rent it and don't buy unless u are a har core marvel fan.

One of the best Superhero films to date,"""The Avengers"" is the first 'team up' movie for the MCU combining Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor. Alongside with Black Widow, Hawkeye, Nick Fury, and of course, The Hulk. To fight the maniacal and oddly comical in all the best ways, Loki, Brother of Thor and part Frost Giant. And this movie is everything you could ever think you would want in a super hero collaboration film.Joss Whedon wrote and directed this film to perfection. With the team up of everyone being seamless and interesting with various conflicts throughout and the almost certain that they could never work together ever until the end. Each character feels used amazingly with comedy being brought in perfectly, drama at the perfect times, and a whole hell of a lot of action in this 143 minute film. With expanding on a lot of the small quirks of each character and the nail biting tension throughout the film done by the fantastic direction and great feel of this film. Joss Whedon put in all he could ever do in this film and executed it perfectly.The writing by Whedon is also flawless. When I first saw this film in 2012, I honestly thought these actors were real with how fluent and smooth their dialogue was combined with the A+ acting done too by each and every cast member, even the 'one scene' actors shown throughout. Not a single actor had any opinion in the writing of the film and with solely Whedon writing it, you can see how well of a writer he is and how smooth he can make the conversations in this film. Especially my favorite parts of the dialogue are the small on going jokes throughout the film with each character, it brings the light out of some of the darkest scenes and can make each and everyone as memorable as possible. I remember quoting this film like it was a religious text or something with how well written it is.The acting is once again perfect. Robert Downey Jr. plays once again a flawless Tony Stark with either his smooth and slick execution of every line, to him hiding snacks throughout the sets to add to his quirky character that the audience has grown to love and appreciate in the film. New Comer Mark Ruffalo in the MCU also kills it as Bruce Banner/Hulk with his uneasy performance and social awkwardness too. Everyone else, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Samuel L. Jackson also do amazingly with their roles with a smooth balance of comedy and seriousness in each of their scenes. The casting in this series is still flawless and I don't want to change a single cast member with their respective roles.The Avengers is a fantastic movie that will be put down in history as one of the best superhero movies to ever exist and should deserve its popularity and praise for its technical accomplishment and storytelling milestone.The Avengers gets a 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
is the MCU really that great?,"First I rated this movie a 10 back in 2017 as during that time I was still brainwashed under the MCU. I thought they were prefect movies. I'll keep Avengers 1 as 10/10 instead of giving it a 6/10.
It's great for being a movie on this scale it's just not near the best movies or superhero movies in terms of story and development.Back in 2012 I was MCU hyped and practically worshiped the MCU and praised movies like Avengers 1. At the time in 2012 Avengers 1 I felt was the greatest thing ever.Now in 2019 my views on Avengers 1 and the MCU has changed completely. MCU does not deserve the hype it gets from the general audience and media.
Avengers 1 even for a first take was pretty generic where it still has unanswered plot holes.Avengers 1 is a good movie on its own comparison. Its overrated generally speaking. It has brainwashed fans/kids/fanboys (like I was). I was ignorant to the flaws and worshipped an ugly looking movie like Avengers 1. I once worshipped the MCU like a damn fool.MCU and the Avengers 1 ruins its self with lack of character/story development, under used villains, weak heroes and pointless jokes.Other than Loki, hela and Thanos all villains are jobbers. All the heroes are treated as highly durable in terms of plot device and plot armour.Recommendation: Watch this movie for fun while drinking a beer or some food with a lot of sugar otherwise you may get brainwashed like I was. In addition, if your will power is weak don't watch this movie or any MCU movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good, not great","The Avengers is a dream combination of some major super heroes. It is what you can expect out of a Marvel comics movie. It has some good action(largely thanks to The Hulk), and a few moments that will make you smile (Few involving Stark/ Iron Man). However more emphasis seemed to be on these 2 characters and the other characters sort of fell behind. The movie had the potential with so many superhero characters. It could have done much more and could have been even better. Having said all this, it is a one-time watch at least.Not enough to deserve an 8.5 though.Good but not that great.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Very good, but not the greatest.","Hey guys. I've written a HUGE review of this. Here is the first few paragraphs. Head over to www.thecrat.com to read my full review.Disclaimer: if you're anything like me, you want to go into The Avengers as blind as possible. I will try to avoid addressing the majority of the plot, but when I have to clearly address plot points I will mark them as spoilers.2012 is gearing up to be the biggest year in film ever. With new entries into some of the most beloved franchises of all time (Lord of the Rings, Alien, James Bond and Batman) it is a good year to be a film geek. The first of the year's massive releases arrives in the form of The Avengers (sorry, Hunger Games, you have the box office, but not the scope to join the heavy hitters). The question everyone (or just geeks) is asking: is this the best comic book film ever? I would have to answer with an emphatic no. This film is big, huge in fact, and it gets a lot of things right. But I also think, considering the pedigree and lead-up to this film, The Avengers should have been a game-changer. Unfortunately, it is not.The Avengers is the culmination of the 'Marvel Studios' Cinematic Universe'. Marvel has created a series of films starring their heroes (Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and The Incredible Hulk) that all coincide in the same reality (just like the comic books). This connectivity has been planned from the start so that when Marvel was ready, they could join these characters into a single film. That moment has arrived with The Avengers. The Avengers is primarily made for fans of these films: if you have skipped the previous films and missed the back-story, you may find that your enjoyment of this new entry is limited.The plot of The Avengers sees the demigod Loki (the great, snarling Tom Hiddleston) planning to enslave the entirety of the human race. Minor spoilers: after his exile in Thor, Loki finds himself in a strange portion of the universe, one controlled by an alien race known as the Chitauri (the identity of this race is inconsequential, and it is revealed within the first few moments of The Avengers). Loki plans to use the Chitauri's numbers to achieve his goal of world domination. Once Loki makes his presence known on earth, it is up to Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) to unite earth's mightiest heroes into a force capable of combating Loki and the Chitauri.The man primarily responsible for this cinematic interpretation of the comic is Joss Whedon. Whedon acts as the writer and director of The Avengers and it is far and away his biggest undertaking yet. Mainly known for his television work (Buffy and Firefly), Whedon has only ever directed one other film: the low-scale (compared to The Avengers) Serenity. Marvel Studios has a reputation of hiring risky or untested (in big budget films) actors and directors to make their films (the recovering addict Robert Downey Jnr as Iron Man, the relatively unknown Chris Hemsworth as Thor) and the majority of these decisions have paid off gloriously. Unfortunately, Whedon isn't exactly one of them. Despite being an authority on geek culture, Whedon's pacing, plot and cinematic eye are good, but they still leave a lot to be desired. This is a quantum leap in terms of his career and Whedon (mostly) steps up to the plate. The Avengers would be a daunting prospect for any director, let alone one with a single film under their belt. Whedon is largely regarded for his writing and in The Avengers it is very much hit and miss. He nails the characters' voices and his dialogue is mostly fantastic (except for a few Downey Jnr quips – but knowing him, I'd imagine they are improvised).However, his basic plot framework is quite muddled. A film of this calibre should function like a well-oiled machine, not feel like it is made out of spare parts. To read the rest head to www.thecrat.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Avengers save not just the world, but super hero movies as well!","I deliberately avoided seeing any trailers or pictures or anything that might have reduced the impact of The Avengers, but I don't think it would have made any difference.Simply put Joss Whedon has succeeded where so many others have failed in the past, most notably DC Comics,to bring comic book characters to the real world and the big screen,without alienating the fans or confusing the newbies, and seemingly the hardest task, to make it a good movie. An indication of how he has succeeded is my poor 11 year old daughter, who gets dragged to all the Iron Man, Green Lantern, etc, movies with me and her brothers and she suffers through them quietly (mostly). However after leaving The Avengers she declared it her favourite movie ever.I can't comment on how you would enjoy this movie without the back story contained in the previous Marvel/Avengers Characters movies, but I think that pretty much everyone alive today has some knowledge of who Iron Man, The Hulk and Captain America are, you should be able to work the rest out from there.I saw it in 3D and it was good, but I wouldn't say the 3D is a must. But I would say see it on the big screen, and see it as soon as you can!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A great summer film. Is it more than that, sorry Joss, no it's not.","The Avengers is not as good as The Dark Knight, I'm just going to say that from the off, the storyline is escapism and it has some genuinely funny moments in it, but it doesn't have the deep characters or visual spectacle. Joss Whedon's script keeps the film going, and lets be honest, this film could have been a train wreck. What makes The Avengers tick is the relationships that each of the characters have with one another. This is where the film really takes flight, when all the characters are in a pressure cooker together, it gives the film weight and suspense especially with Mark Ruffalo's Hulk. Joss Whedon should be given a lot of credit for crafting such a cohesive and well thought out script.The Dialogue is what keeps it above board, visuals have never been Joss Whedon's strong suit, but I did notice a wink to his first feature film Serenity in zoom shots in the action sequences (see Serenity's finale as the ship falls from the sky). The film doesn't look bad by any means it just has the same sheen that the other Marvel films seem to support, but it didn't really have a choice following suit from its predecessors. But lack of visual flair is sometimes what makes me dislike these movies, they look too clean and have a sheen that makes it look too much like a cartoon for my personal taste. Other Superhero film don't seem to have this ""sheen"", making them more visually pleasing to me - the Nolan and Burton Batman's spring to mind as well as the Marvel Xmen films.The film works equally as well in 2D as it does in 3D, the ""third"" dimension is not needed here, the visual storytelling (though nothing groundbreaking) stands on its own two feet, making the 3D gimmick unnecessary.Its very difficult to score this film as it is by and large a fantastic superhero film, thats enjoyable from beginning to end. But enjoyment isn't all I mark it on, was the story original, well no not at all, it was an accumulation of its heroes solo films. Were the visuals good, yes, but they weren't anything you haven't seen in other similar films. The Avengers is fun and Joss's ingenious and humorous dialogue will make you come back for another sitting, but by and large this isn't a anything more than a summer popcorn film, not that it tries to be more either. But what do I know I gave Salt a 9.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A family friendly summer blockbuster,"This would be a good movie to take the family to for a movie night, it has everything you would expect from a big summer blockbuster - lots of eye candy with fancy special effects, a simple and understandable straight forward plot, the good guys and bad guys are well defined and in stark black and white so its easy to know who to root for and against.The best part of the movie is the humor, it has a tongue in cheek type style and there are some good laughs in the movie. Its definitely a light-hearted movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.It loses some points for basically being too oriented for a kids audience, it was not really my kind of movie because its almost like a Disney theme park ride, and simple minded in a sense. It's over-rated for sure at IMDb, but not surprising, many of the comic book movies are over-rated at this site because of their wide spread popular appeal.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Takes itself a bit too seriously,This is worth at watch but just once. The I wouldn't watch this again. Sure they spent a lot on effects and a grand battle scene at the end but throwing money at a movie doesn't help a weak story.This screenplay is weak - it is a overlong with has some rather strained dialog between the leads. The weakest thing about the story is why the evil guy wanted to wreak so much havoc without much reason. It just felt a bit contrived and isn't very involving. Don't feel for any of the characters.There is some wit and humor from Scarlett's deadpan Black Widow and Robert Downey's rather lame one liners.What happened to the charm of the old action hero movies?,4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The biggest superhero spectacle yet, without losing focus on the characters","It has finally been assembled. Marvel's decision to make ""The Avengers"" might seem like the superhero equivalent of the ensemble movie ""Valentine's Day,"" or the theory that stuffing multiple popular actors into one movie is an adequate substitute for storytelling and makes it so marketable that no one could pass it up.While that's not necessarily not true of Marvel's super plan five years in the making, ""The Avengers"" means something more to comic and superhero fans; it is a culmination of a lifetime of anticipation that does in fact have a historical precedent set by Marvel Comics. Essentially, this movie is a collective nerd-gasm, but whether you're part of it or not, there's plenty to love about how geek godfather Joss Whedon tackles this gargantuan task.Still, it's pretty amazing what bundling seven or so of the most beloved comic characters of all time into one package can do when it comes to creating an entertaining diversion. Many folks will nitpick at ""The Avengers"" script from now until eternity, but something needs to be said for the experience of being so awe-stricken that you couldn't care about those things if you tried. There's no shame in covering up ""flaws"" with entertainment, especially when you deliver that entertainment with a level of quality rivaled by few blockbusters of this scale.""The Avengers"" is a near-perfect execution of giving the people what they want. If you had to make a list of what you wanted from an ""Avengers"" movie, Whedon and Marvel would appear to have read your mind. The action sequences blow every previous superhero film out of the air, land and sea, the wit and humor come from more than just a series of punchlines or catch phrases, and all the characters get a chance to shine from an action and development perspective.Story is secondary to achieving those goals. Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) power-obsessed brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has made a deal with an alien race known as the Chitauri to destroy Earth so he can rule it. He breaks into a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility and steals the Tesseract, an object at the center of ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" that has the power to open a gateway through which the Chitauri can invade. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), realizing Earth is about to be at war with an unstoppable force, summons Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), a displaced Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Thor in hopes they can place nice and band together to stop Loki.So you have high stakes (global destruction), and a force powerful enough to justifiably bring all these heroes together. That's all you really need. The script properly gives each hero reasons to fight and a personal journey, something to overcome. All this for seven characters in a 140-minute runtime. Even though we're building up to yet another movie climax that involves the destruction of a major American city by hostile alien forces, it's still this unique grouping of characters that changes the whole game.As someone who seems to specialize in creating projects that develop cult followings, Whedon was really a perfect choice to write and direct. Despite what one would assume to be a lot of pressure, you never get the sense that ""The Avengers"" is trying too hard. The balancing act of all these characters might have seemed too tall an order for any one man, yet with actors really dedicated to the souls of their characters, Whedon and the cast pack in so much into even the smallest of exchanges.One character the movie excels at in particular is The Hulk. Ruffalo commands the role of Banner as if he was the one who played him in the first two ""Hulk"" features. The script paints him as the team's secret weapon, but also as the most volatile link in the chain. Some fear the green monster, others (Tony Stark) try to provoke him. Either way, despite sharing screen time, this Hulk is both more brutal and emotionally accessible than ever before. More than any other character, you'll end up most curious about what Marvel might do with him next.In general, the lack of time needing to be spent on plot development gets rationed off to all the characters, allowing the third-act action to pay off in more terms than simply eye candy. Each hero has a personal story arc or obstacle to overcome, whether its Tony Stark proving he can set aside his ego or Captain American understanding that he can be relevant in the 21st Century.With so many heroes in one film, Hiddleston had to bear a ton of weight as Loki, creating a presence that could balance out all these good guys. Although not much of a physical threat, his The Joker-like move to allow himself to be imprisoned gives him the fuel to be cunning and unpredictable in performance and in actuality.From a pure entertainment perspective, ""The Avengers"" should be considered king of all superhero movies. What it lacks in thematic and character depth it makes up for with action and humor. Whedon writes so expertly around clichés and identifies ways to make the film naturally funny, and the way the action scenes are edited together, there's no confusion in regard to what's going on despite the chaos of the Chitauri invasion scene.Marvel deserves all the credit in the world for building to this point and delivering precisely what fans wanted. Although anyone can enjoy this romp, not just those who saw both ""Iron Man"" films, ""Thor"" and ""Captain America,"" there's no doubt the legwork in those films makes it so much easier to enjoy the entire dynamic of ""The Avengers."" What a momentous achievement from a business, filmmaking and audience perspective.~Steven CThanks for reading! Check out moviemusereviews.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Really Spectacular Movie,"I actually was not expecting to be that good but I really got to say that was one of the best movies I have ever seen. A really good plot, the biggest and most amazing scenes of battle ever, spectacular performances by our heroes and all the cast, awesome visuals effects and another amazing soundtrack.One of the things that really impressed me was the fact the each hero received the right amount of time on the screen and for that was possible to see how much work did everyone do.Of course, once more we have the amazing performance of Robert Downey, Jr as Iron Man that gives us the humor and bravery that we wanted to see by this character. But he is not the only good actor in the movie, we also have Chris Evans as Captain America that delivers the leadership needed, Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow that show us how amazing a woman can be in a situation of danger, Chris Hemsworth as Thor that gives us that bravery, strenght and performance we wanted to see from him, Tom Hiddleston as Loki that delivers the big villain with no compassion that this movie needed, Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson funny and brave as always, Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill the new woman with a lot of potential, Stellan Skarsgård as Dr. Erik Selvig also great performance, Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye a actor that show us archery like no one and spectacular performance, our Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury funny and amazing as always and another new entrance in the film, Mark Ruffalo as Dr. Bruce Banner / Hulk that delivers the incredible Hulk we all wanted to see. Everyone that was a part of the cast, direction, production... have my congratulations for the amazing work to give us the Avengers movie we all wished for.Really spectacular movie. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Reviews for Avengers,"The movie engages the viewer from a very strong opening sequence through the two bonus scenes included in the closing credits. The nearly two and a half hour running time passes by swiftly and leaves you eagerly awaiting a follow-up sequel.While Whedon smartly recognizes how key Downey Jr.'s Stark is to the story, he also allows most all of his cast, heroes and villain, ample opportunities to shine, both in dialogue and action.

bravo bravo!!!!!,"The Avengers is a smash! This movie was very well written and was action packed the entire movie (no kidding)!!!! It had very little profanity and no blood except for the part where Loki, Thor's brother takes somebody's eye out with his staff. It does not show up close view but anyway I would tell all my friends about this film! Don't take kids under 7 to see it just for the action part of it! I will make this promise, if you see it you will love it!!! If you do not love it, sorry movies are not your thing! Also a shout out to Robert Downey, Jr.( aka. Iron man) he did great!

"""The Avengers""'s New Clothes","It so happened that ""The Avengers"" has quite naturally and comfortably occupied the box office throne. It almost effortlessly managed to get to the very top and join the selected company of such distinguished titans as ""Avatar"", ""Titanic"", ""Harry Potter"", ""The Lord of the Rings"", and ""Pirates of the Caribbean"".In addition to the dazzling box office glory, ""The Avengers"" is enjoying an unprecedented public love of epic, almost unhealthy, flirting with obsession proportions.Currently ""The Avengers"" confidently occupies the 39th position among the best movies of all time on IMDb – higher on the list than ""Citizen Kane"", ""Alien"", ""American Beauty"", ""Vertigo"", ""The Green Mile"", ""Once Upon A Time in America"",""Amadeus"",""Some Like It Hot"", or ""Gone With The Wind"".The reviewers on Netflix are ecstatic and gush with admiration: ""This was the best super hero movie ever! It had a great plot, and I enjoyed it incredibly!"" ""It has heart! It has humor"" ""Not a dull moment. The cast did an amazing job"" ""I loved this movie. It was fantastic"" ""This movie was amazing! All of the heroes were excellent"" ""The truth is that you can't scream enough praise for this movie""And in the middle of all this euphoric madness, in the midst of all this frenzied rage, in the epicenter of all this outrageous triumph of the mediocrity produced by the never staying idle, overworked Hollywood assembly lines, we can barely hear a few sane, sober voices saying in a childlike amazement ""Wait a minuteThe Emperor is naked!""Yes, despite its colorful, glaring clothes mostly made of special effects, ""The Avengers"" is almost completely naked: there is no story, no good scenes or dialogs, no acting (because there is no substance), no core, no depth, no intrigue, no tension, no mystery, no heart, and, yes – no humor.What is called humor in ""The Avengers"" does indeed have one positive component in it: there is no bathroom jokes so common in the modern comedies. No one is burping, vomiting, breaking winds, showing naked buttocks, doing any other indecencies or saying any other obscenities. Unfortunately, the humor in ""The Avengers"" has also a negative side: it is very primitive and quite unfunny.The special effects in ""The Avengers"" are impressive, but chaotically purposeless, and not breathtaking or intelligent or deeply symbolic as in ""Avatar"" or ""The Lord of the Rings"".The amounts of an exciting action in ""The Avengers"" are vast, and the density of the movie stars would make any blockbuster jealous. Nevertheless, those looking for anything more than a liberally seasoned with primitive humor collection of sloppily connected action sequences and special effects will be utterly disappointed.However, judging by the box office success of ""The Avengers"", nothing else is at all needed... A bunch of the familiar from childhood pathetic cartoonish super heroes cheerfully kicking butts of a little less cartoonish, but still pathetic villains and almost effortlessly but incredibly heroically saving the world in their spare time is just enough to make most movie goers extremely happy.There is nothing mysterious about this - after all, the most popular restaurant in the world is not a restaurant with the best food, or the most famous and skillful chef, or the nicest location, or the most elegant atmosphere, or the most exquisite wine list.The Emperor of restaurants is McDonalds – a familiar from childhood good bargain with standard, very basic, not very healthy, but at the same time very addictive menu.Those highly praising the story, the acting, and all the other non- existent components of ""The Avengers"" become like a patron, who after visiting a local McDonalds would suddenly blurt out something like ""What an elegant atmosphere we enjoyed when we visited McDonalds last time! The waiters were so attentive! The menu was so intriguing! The food was of finest quality and don't forget about the location – the nicest in town!""The hard truth is that whereas in my hypothetical example with McDonalds everyone understands that the patron talks nonsense, most of the moviegoers will not notice a striking discrepancy between the cheap, unimaginative fast food action they see on the screen and all the high praises that ""The Avengers"" receiveIndeed, Wisdom is found on the lips of the discerning, but a rod is for the back of one who has no sense.knowyourmovie.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I'm sure many people can think of 250 movies that're far superior to this one.The acting itself was fine, although it did seem a little awkward at times. The dialogue did get extremely cheesy, although it was good cheesy.

A rollicking good ride.,"Four years ago Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury appeared in Iron Man's end credit scene and whipped the comic book geek-world into a frenzy; it was a hint at larger things to come within the Marvel universe and the fans knew it. Since then we've witnessed a franchise (including The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America) that has excelled in self-referential plugs, character cameos and plot crossovers, all building a giddy excitement towards the main show: The Avengers. It was worth the wait.Writer-director Joss Whedon has concocted a perfect blend of mouth-watering action, laugh-out-loud humour and eye-blistering CGI. Whether it's the excellent Thor vs Iron Man vs Captain America rumble in the forest, the mind-boggingly spectacular 30 minute finale in downtown Manhattan, or any scene with the Hulk, the bruising action is choreographed and executed with a flair not seen in any of the aforementioned standalone movies and, along with the series' best CGI, is likely to have your jaw on the ground. Similarly, the script and dialogue is crafted with such a high level of intelligence and wittiness that every joke hits the mark – the Hulk's reaction to Loki belittling him had me in tears – and the story roars along at a cracking pace, allowing you to glide over the minor gaps in plot. However, perhaps Whedon's most amazing feat is how he balances the screen time among the mammoth cast (who continue their great work from the franchise's previous instalments); he has kept every character in focus, yet never over-shadowing the others, resulting in an ensemble piece that clicks from the get go. The opening act may be a tad slow, but this superhero adventure is a rollicking good ride with genuine awe-inspiring moments. Bring on the sequel.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Okay Movie Great Comic,"The movie gets high marks for not being hokey. In fact great effort was put in the movie to make it a movie. It gets a well done from me. You have to suspend any logic or common sense to be entertained. If you can, this movie will keep you occupied for over 2 hours. Don't be tempted to make sense out of the story because it leads to questions that invite logic and common sense. The comics can get away with so much because in that world, it comes across as that is what happens in that world. Trying to transfer comics to the screen becomes challenging because trying to bring a super hero to reality is not easy. So we settle for the next best thing which is to make it entertaining. The director pulls that off quite well. In the end, you want to ask your self if you got your monies or tickets worth. The answer is yes. This is not a movie that invites you to come back and see it again. There are no memorable scenes which is its only flaw all things considered. Go see it in the theater and then wait until it comes out on cable. Pass on the DVD purchase. Good popcorn movie, candy, tasty drink and snack....",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Tom Hiddlestone does justice to this character in a way that truly signifies a real god of mischief. Scheming and plotting with thoughts and plans coming at split second intervals, Tom Hiddlestone still gives his character that dynamism of a brainiac with deep inner pain that you'd think could boil over at any moment.Mind blowing movie for a super hero generation.

Marvel's The Avengers is truly marvelous,"Marvel's The Avengers directed by Joss Whdeon is one of the best movies belonging to superhero genre ever.The Iron Man,Thor,The Black Widow,The Captain America,The Hulk,The Hawkeye.Phew!Watching the superheroes on the big screen,with the three-dimensional(3D) effect sounds great but the viewing is exceptionally awesome.Although the movie has had its release in Bahrain quite late(4th May) whereas in most parts of the world the movie was scheduled to release on April 11th.This is one of those rare movies which may have been sounding great on paper but is exceptionally awesome even when viewed on the celluloid.Story:- Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) is director of S.H.I.E.L.D, an international peace keeping agency. The agency is a who's who of Marvel Super Heroes, with Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). When global security is threatened by Loki and his cohorts, Nick Fury and his team will need all their powers to save the world from disaster.The only draw-back of the movie is its length.Lasting up to 143 minutes,one would have got exhausted but thanks to Joss Whedon who provides enough of entertainment in those 143 minutes!The direction by Joss Whedon is marvelous.He does a great job!The action scenes has been shot very well and the use of 3D effects makes the action sequences look more stylish.Performances:- Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man is excellent.Mark Ruffalo though has a shorter screen space still manages to register an impact.Chris Hemsworth is good.Chris Evans is excellent.Scarlett Johansson is fine.Jeremy Renner is subtle.Samuel Jackson does a good job.All in all,The Avengers is a must-watch for all the super-hero fans.I am going to give it a nine on ten.Two Thumbs Up!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Overrated, Cliché Marvel Film","Never saw it in the movie theater, but I had heard that it was great, and awesome. After some time it finally hit DVD, so I rented it, and I was completely disappointed. There was nothing amazing about it. The acting was okay, the story was meh, and the villain (which in my opinion is a big part of a super hero film) was just awful. People don't know about movies now a days, the fact that the quote ""Best Super hero move of all time"" is printed on the DVD cover, really makes me doubt the film industry today. If this mess of a movie can make over a billion dollars at the box office, and Masterpieces can't even get 100 millions is disheartening. Hands down the most over rated movie of all time.

Marvel Masterpiece,"Since that final clip with Nick Fury and Tony Stark in Iron Man, there was hope that maybe Marvel could really be doing an Avengers movie. 4 years later and 4 movies later (Iron Man 2, Hulk, Thor, Captain America) and we have Joss Wheddon's Avengers.What makes The Avengers so Engaging and Intriguing is the dialogue between the superheroes. Joss Wheddon should be awarded with an Oscar for the writing and directing of The Avengers. Everyone blended in so naturally and their back and fourth banter made for some good comedy. Everyone felt equal from Hawkeye to Hulk. It is so difficult to balance these personalities on screen and I don't think any other director besides Joss would've been able to pull it off the way he did.The Action scenes in the Avengers is as Epic as it gets. The last hour is like a marathon of awesomeness. Every action sequence in this movie was perfectly executed and each character had their significant moments.The cast was phenomenal as usual, but the show-stealer is definitely Mark Ruffalo. His portrayal of the incredible hulk was spot on. He was wildly entertaining and I couldn't help but cheer him on when he smashed sh!t. I think what made the Hulk work was because he was used sparingly.Lo-Ki as the villain was great. I felt he was developed a lot better here than in Thor. He was witty and had an evil aura about him especially when he was interacting with the ""mortals"".Never have I enjoyed a movie so much as the Avengers. The 2 hour plus runtime flew by easily and I was left wanting more once it ended. Once in a while a masterpiece of a film comes along, and after the hilarious closing scene after the credits, it was clear that this was Marvel's Masterpiece.

True, they may save the Earth, but I bet the property damages in doing so run into the billions. Any insurance guy watching this would have five simultaneous cardiac arrests, so if you fall into that category best to stay home and plan some more obnoxious ads for daytime. But that's another story...There are laughs a-plenty too, with Tony Stark's (AKA Iron Man) flippant comments, Steve Rogers's (AKA Captain America) fish-out-of-water situation, The Hulk's (AKA Bruce Banner) efforts not to GET MAD and Thor's (AKA er... Thor) utterly straight-laced persona. The clash of personalities and their different methods of dealing with the opposition just add to the fun, and Samuel L Jackson has his best role in ages as the eyepatched hard-as-nails leader who puts them together. There is also another member played by Scarlet Johansson called the Black Widow, but I apologise for saying that her part felt like tokenism to pacify all you feminists out there. Sorry, girls. Now make a peanut butter sandwich and finish the washing up. *Slaps her bottom*.There's never a dull moment, and ALL the money is there on the screen. Or in the Cayman Islands accounts of the stars. Bit of advice though: turn the sound down, unless you want your neighbours to complain. Be a good citizen. And get used to LOADS more superhero movies coming out in the near future.

Why?,"Does so many voters (as I write this 430) give only 1/10. They can't be serious about voting. No one can honestly be true about voting like that. This really is the best Marvel superhero movie, ever. What are they afraid of? and the so called top 1000 voters - shame on them! Really often we see top 1000 voters who presses a movie down - by giving bad votes. Once in a while, some of the old movies are ready to get out of the top 250 list. They have to accept that. The project to get the Avengers together, has been done in an excellent way - bravo. I was not sure, what to get - because so many heroes should work together. Would someone steal the limelight? And would it be 80% Iron Man, and 20% Avengers? No, its is pure 100% Avengers. Thank you.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Despite a Cast of A-List Stars, ""The Avengers"" is Just Another Superhero Movie","I will start out by saying that overall, I did enjoy this film. I feel like the rating system here on IMDb is used so incorrectly by the majority of folks who use it. For example, if someone loved this movie, they give it a 10. If they didn't like it, they give it a 1, where the truth actually lies somewhere in the middle. Everything is NOT black and white in movies, and I feel like this movie is an unfortunate byproduct of that misconception. With a star studded cast and some pretty incredible visuals, ""The Avengers"" does many things well that a superhero movie should. What this movie doesn't do well is deliver a unique ""gosh that's the best superhero movie i've ever seen!"" experience, despite what the inflated rating would tell you.The plot of ""The Avengers"" features a pretty basic premise; The US government, naive to their own research on a mysterious object called the Tesseract, accidentally opens a rift to another world allowing the Norse god Loki to enter Earth and essentially wreak havoc. This of course leads to the formation of ""The Avengers"", which is a collection of Marvel superheroes that many of you will recognize, either from the comic books or previous Marvel films. Together, under ""The Avengers initiative"", these superheroes go to battle with Loki over the sacred Tesseract which, when wielded by Loki, can open a rift to another dimension and potentially end the world as we know it. Sound familiar? It should, as this general pretense has been used many times over in the past. While the plot doesn't feature any large holes, it also doesn't bring anything new or exciting to the table, either. You can expect many ""mini"" battles between Loki and the heroes along the way, ultimately leading to the ""final showdown"" of the film. This is superhero movie 101, and while it works for all intensive purposes, ""The Avengers"" hardly innovates the genre in any way. Based on it's high rating, I had expected a somewhat unique experience for a superhero movie, but I was unfortunately let down in this regard. The movie does pace itself quite well, however, which kept me interested throughout. If there is one thing ""The Avengers"" does very well, it's keeping the viewer interested without any serious lulls in the action.Next up is the acting/casting. This movie is literally jam packed with famous actors/actresses, from Robert Downey Jr. as the always recognizable Iron Man(my personal favorite from not just these films but all in the Marvel collection), Chris Evans as Captain America, Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk, and Chris Hemsworth returning as Thor(my second favorite of these characters). There are many others, from Scarlett Johansson, to Samuel L. Jackson, to Jeremy Renner, etc etc. You get the idea. There are lots of famous people in this movie. The acting from these heavyweights of the industry is generally very good, despite a pretty generic script. You can expect a lot of cheesy one-liners, petty arguments, and general ""i'm a better superhero than you"" moments throughout the script. With a lack of clever writing and, in my honest opinion, a truly despicable villain(Loki just doesn't do it for me, sorry. He looks like a 15 year old boy with a deer helmet), ""The Avengers"" has a hard time distinguishing itself from the pack, despite all the talented actors involved with this film. One could really make the argument that the talented actors casted for this film ARE what makes the movie above average, because they really have to make the most out of what they are given in the script.Overall, ""The Avengers"" offers an exciting, albeit predictable, superhero experience. The actors bring their A-game for this film and the electricity between them definitely makes this movie better. I do have to say I felt a bit of nostalgia watching some of my favorite heroes from childhood band together on the big screen to battle evil. Despite it's fairly long runtime, ""The Avengers"" kept me interested from start to finish even if I cringed at some of the writing from time to time. Overall though, I think it was the villain, Loki, who brought the viewing experience down for me. He just isn't believable as a true villain, and the ""twist"" at the end will leave you feeling pretty underwhelmed. Despite these fall backs, though, this is still an enjoyable film to watch. If you expect something more than a 2 hour superhero romp coming into this, you may find yourself a bit disappointed like I was. If you come into this thinking that you will see some cool superhero action and some great actors, you will be much better off. ""The Avengers"" is a cool superhero movie, but in my opinion, nothing more. This film isn't American Beauty or even the Dark Knight(best superhero movie ever IMO), so as long as you temper your expectations, you will more than likely enjoy ""The Avengers"".For an exciting, if somewhat underwhelming, superhero experience, I give ""The Avengers"" a solid 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Action packed & Unlimited Fun,"Avengers had one of the longest marketing technique used in the movie industry.Its marketing started way back in 2008 with the release of Iron-Man.After 4 years and 5 movies later, that movie is finally released.The Avengers fulfills all the expectations that were raised in this 4 year duration.All the main actors have returned (except Edward Norton ,replaced by Mark Ruffalo for The Hulk) ,and the story is fun ,witty and action packed.The biggest drawbacks most star-studded movies encounter is giving the comparatively more famous actor the biggest chunk of role.Thankfully this was not the deal for Avengers.All the main heroes (IronMan,Captain America ,Thor & Hulk) got equally big as well as important part in the story.The secondary actors (Nick Fury & Black Widow) were not brushed off ,and even with all the superheroes getting the good parts ,these 2 still had major roles.The only character felt unused and a bit expendable was Hawkeye. This speaks volumes of how the story has been handled.Juggling 6-7 heroes and giving each ample screen time is no easy task.In the acting department ,Robert Downey stole the show as he usually does.He was born to play IronMan.In every scene he appears he is in total style and gives IronMan his soul. Both Chris Evans(Captain America) & Chris Hemsworth (Thor) were not bad.Both did equal justice to their roles.Tom Hiddleston (Loki) delivered yet another excellent villainous role ,similar to the one he did in Thor.Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow) had a surprisingly longer and major role and she too gives her best.Jeremy Renner (HawkEye) was too rigid ,this may be due to his role not being fully fledged.Samuel J(Nick Fury) was good. But the true show stealer was Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk.The Hulk will indeed be EVERYONE's favourite character once they have seen Avengers.Every scene & action scene by Hulk is just Pure Awesomeness.Story as i previously said is truly noteworthy because of the huge juggling acting of giving each Hero their own connection with the movie.But in terms of story telling ,it falters just a bit.The story makes way for the action and takes the backseat.While the first half concentrates on the story ,the second is completely action based.Action scenes are superb.The numerous fight scenes,hero vs hero,hero vs hoardes ,heroes vs the villain ,ALL are properly choreographed and exciting.Direction was great.The way Joss Whedon managed to direct this movie with these many superheroes and mixing them and giving one solid movie is truly remarkable.On the downside the first half was riddled with pacing issues.Some dragging scenes in the first half drained the excitement after some great fights.But once the Hulk appears ,the movie just blasts off to high levels of awesomeness never to go down again.The real Avengers movie starts with The Hulk and ends with him too. The dialogues were witty and funny ,and Robert Downey's style of delivery & Hulk's grunts of words steal many scenes away.Overall Avengers is a colourful,funny,action packed movie that delivers its promise of a United Super Heroes movie.The movie might not be legendary ,but The Hulk & Robert Downey will not be forgotten.

Special effects for special people.,"Where to start. Me and my wife watched this movie yesterday, to forget about the drama called 'battleship' (don't get me started.) But it's hard to choose the most retarded movie between the two. This one had some okay jokes in it, but like many people said: you don't feel any threat, you don't feel any story, you just see special effects and ""UHMERICA F* YAA"" 2hrs straight. The effects were good, and the Hulk smashed like he never smashed before, but every movie starts sucking as soon as you realize nobody of the good guys can actually die. (Lord Of the rings anyone?) and when legions of 10x more bad-ass alien monsters are killed throwing a chair at them or blind-aimed headshotting them with a bow on a spaceship going 300mph, you know you're just wasting your time. Anybody with the very least amount of self-respect, stay away from this movie, How this garbage achieved to get 8.6 on IMDb is more entertaining for me than watching that movie.

The Hulk (and Others) Smash Expectations,"This is what we have been waiting for. The culmination of years of planning, years of filming and years of cross-pollination of characters throughout the Marvel movie universe. The bar was set unbelievably high and I did my best to temper my expectations as I walked into the theater along with the millions upon millions of moviegoers this opening weekend. When the lights dropped, I mentally wiped the slate clean and hoped beyond hope that it was good (at least better than Iron Man 2). As so many other people have said by now, I was more than pleased.The Avengers follows the beginning of one of Marvel comics most powerful supergroups, as the world finds itself woefully unprepared for an alien onslaught led by the scorned demi-god, Loki. While the various heroes don't play nicely together at first, they come together when the time comes and prove they are much more powerful together than apart. Together, they are unstoppable.Many of the reviews have been focusing on Mark Ruffalo and his charismatic portrayal of Bruce Banner, aka The Hulk. Originally much of the focus was on him because he is now the third actor in as many films to play the legendary green behemoth. Yet after the release, the buzz stayed on him because he brought something to Hulk that was sorely lacking before, humanity. Arguably Ruffalo wasn't on screen a ton and it's hard to say whether we have been so amazed with his performance if it was ninety minutes or more, but since Marvel and company immediately signed him to a six-picture deal to continue being big, green and angry, we will all get our chance to test the theory out. I've always loved Ruffalo as an actor and I have all the faith in the world he can make this rage monster a dynamic character to watch, but the real gamble will come in the script. We've seen full movies with Eric Bana and Edward Norton already, so this next one (or two, or three) need to bring something different, not just a rehash of those before. Luckily, the Avengers phenomenon also allows the next Hulk picture to skip over the origin story, since it's fairly unnecessary now.While Ruffalo can rightly bask in the glow of a job exceedingly well done, the rest of the cast deserves praise as well. Everyone up and down the line brought their A-game and they played off each other incredibly well. Robert Downey Jr. can sometimes overshadow people on screen, just due to his charisma, but he did exactly what he said his character of Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, couldn't doplay nicely with others. However, the pressure was really more on Jeremy Renner (as Hawkeye) and Scarlett Johansson (as Black Widow) since they were only side jobs in some of the previous Marvel chapters. Each did a great job, with extra credit given to Johannson (and possibly her fight double if she had one) for her intro sequence with the Russian mobsters.I can't close this review out without bringing up one of the real-life superheros of the story, writer/director Joss Whedon. The man is a living legend in the geek community and this film proves the accolades and unending praise are well-founded. He achieved a perfect balance of action, pace, and story all while managing to encompass the overabundance of characters. Jokes were well-timed and well-delivered and he allowed for possibly risky moments to go all out, resulting in one of the most hilarious and enjoyable scenes in Marvel movie history (you'll know it when you see it).Sure, there are some nit-picky moments that you can dig up if you're so inclined. Feel free to send me what you think those might be and I'll gladly drop in some of mine. Yet, in the end, the experience is what counts and I couldn't wipe the smile off my face as I left (and not just because the final extra scene at the end of the final credits was pure genius). This movie captured absolutely every bit of the tone and energy of a comic book summer blockbuster and if Whedon was a professor, this would be his Master Class.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I liked it. I've seen it like three times,"I just keep renting it. And I watch my favorite scenes over and over again each time I do. It's delightfully funny. I like these people. I like this story. I love with that Romanoff girl. Mark Ruffalo is great. He is just great. It's balanced. It cannot be easy to portray superheroes but they pull it off. You know they must be up against green screens but I believed it. The writing is fantastic. I can quote lines. My friends can quote lines. Everyone has a favorite scene. I have second third and fourth favorites. It's fast paced but you get to know the characters. I want Hollywood to know if I don't care about the characters I don't care what happens to them. I have almost no memory of ""The Grifters"", because yuck. I like movies with nice characters. And it's colorful. Did you see ""The Ledge"" it is so drab they could have saved money and filmed it in black and white. You're stuck in Baton Rouge, dude just jump, gees. Did you see ""Cloud Atlas"" visually spectacular. That's all it's got and still I'd give it about a six.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
There Was The Anticipation! There Were The Expectations! There Was The Hype! And.....Boy Did It Deliver!!!,"Movie Review: The Avengers (2012) by DareDevilKid.DDKMy Rating: 8.5/10Yes! Oh, boy did this movie deliver! Its like all the cogs fitted perfectly in a well oiled mechanism. Director Joss Whedon has made a brilliant transition from the small to the big screen. The Director has delivered a classic Action/Adventure film of epic proportions. And this was no little achievement, considering all the legendary characters of folklore mostly possessing their individual blockbusters - some really good and some plain mediocre -, which were amalgamated into one huge vista.All the superheroes & even the super-villain merge into the plot beautifully and appear exactly at the opportune moments. Even a somewhat throwaway hero like Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) feels vital. Her fight scenes are Buffy cool. Hemsworth and Evans are more relaxed, more comfortable in their spandex skin. If there's an underused super it's Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) but in the last act he impresses, too.But The true standout is The Hulk. Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner pulls off the trick of allowing his inner rage to simmer just below the surface the whole time. And when the green dude shows up, stand back and just enjoy. He's the first version of Hulk to make his burst of power feel so gratifying. His destructive nature is infectious. Also an honorable mentions have to bestowed upon Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man & Chris Hemsworth's - he's really growing with each passing film - Thor, who adequately support Mark Ruffalo and his alter-ego throughout the movie.The Avengers looks great. The reportedly $250 million budget is on the screen. Many scenes have a great deal of variety. Not just well- choreographed action, there's a cleverness to the very idea to many of the scenes. Whedon pushes his heroes to their limits. When your script can put demigod Thor in peril that's incredible.The plot is simple yet effective - Thor's evil brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston - a slimy megalomaniac) has taken a cube called the Tesseract that harnesses limitless energy and aliens from another dimension intend to invade Earth to get it. Its easy to follow and merges well into the narration to let the film deliver what audiences really want to see - these ultimate superheroes becoming a team and kicking much butt.The action is magnanimous, the CGI effects are dazzling but ushered only when required, great and witty one-liners are interspersed intermittently, the humor is enthralling, the set-pieces are brilliant, each character is painstakingly developed, the narration is crisp and finally but most importantly, the action makes sense - a rarity for action adventure movies nowadays - in a way that you follow each minutest detail even while its bursting on screen at the rate of knots. The action occurs only after enough plot and character detailing and even when it occurs, it smoothly takes the plot forward. This rare feat elevates Whedon as the real superhero of this film.'The Avengers' reminds us of the reason we love movies ant buy tickets for admittance in a cinema hall. It will keep drawing you back for more, as viewing it just once is insulting and will leave you just plain unsatisfied. The euphoria you experience after completing this exalting visual odyssey will settle only after many long hours and then the realization will ultimately dawn - that you have been privileged to witness an classic that will be indelibly etched in cinematic archives.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Schweeeeeeeeeeeeet !!,"I had absolutely no hope of this one making it big. The second I took my seat, boy was I proved wrong by many a mile! There's a reason this is only the second super hero movie in the top 250. Coz its worth it. Period.I was absolutely glued right from the first minute. It was an awesome mixture of high-end action, drama, suspense, thrill, humor and love! OK maybe not love. Who would want that in a super hero movie anyway?Iron Man was at his brutal best whether it was tactics, word play, narcissism or just plain old explosive action. He just did not disappoint! If you thought Iron Man only did solo, you are in for a surprise.I thought Hawkeye and the Black Widow were going to be just another pair of dummies. NOT! They are as much a part of the story as the rest of them. Be prepared for some of their cool moves. Man, does Scarlett look stunning when she is beating the hell out of the bad guys. Hawkeye might have done way better with a gun, but what the hell. To each his own!Thor and Cap. America, the demigod and the strategist, with the awessssome weapon and shield combo, totally kicked butt(ask Loki's horde)! Perhaps, there was little the captain could do with just his shield.And the best for the last. For those who had lost all hopes of Hulk ever entertaining them, this one changes it all. He is now my favorite today! What raw madness (ask Loki)!! This time Hulk gives it all with a pinch of humor that we have missed in the previous two movies.The first half was built around bringing all the super-heroes together and setting up the story line without deviating from the end plot. The second half just blows you away. Joss Whedon seems to have become a master artist when it comes to super cool dudes. He's given each of the good guys an equal say in the movie with none in particular ruling the show.In the end the 2 and a half hours of non-stop fun seemed to be way less and I was left craving for more :( .

It will not do a lot of good for viewers who expect quality in acting, serious plot and dramatic ending w/ special after-effect.

"How to Play It Safe, by Joss Whedon","Walking into the movie theatre, I didn't expect very much. I'm glad I didn't, or I would've been disappointed. The movie starts off slowly, and from the get go, everything about it seems... for lack of a better word, dull. With the success of DC Comic's The Dark Knight, the shoes for superhero flicks were large to fill. Marvel's counterpart failed to deliver the same grandiose style, riveting story, and memorable performances.To start off with, the story felt like a patchwork of scenes put together simply to bring earth's mightiest heroes together for what would turn out to be a forty-five minute, Transformers-esque brawl. Some people may say, ""That sounds awesome! Why are you complaining?"" If you said that, this movie is for you. If you want a little more than ""HULK SMASH!"", look somewhere else.To Joss Whedon's credit, he saw that he had a potential home run and did everything possible not to screw it up. If his goal was to make as much money as possible, he was extremely successful. However, because of this ""playing it safe"" philosophy, the movie relies far too heavily on unexplained coincidences in the plot, character backgrounds found in previous Marvel flicks and also, without giving away any spoilers, blatantly ripping off the ending to a certain Star Wars movie that was panned by critics. The Avengers is a decent popcorn flick that killed at the box office; however, it does not transcend the superhero genre to become a truly great film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The action was good and not overpowering, it only added to rather than being the main part of the movie. The comic level was perfect. Not too much goofy stuff said just to try and get laughs. Every line, imo, was perfectly placed (although I'll have to see it again in order to hear some funny lines that I missed due to the laughter in the theater!). By the way, morning matinée was SOLD OUT full.

Best Superhero Movie!,"It pains me to say that because I was a Spiderman fan growing up and Spiderman started off this Superhero crazed movie run with what was the best movie. What made Spiderman stand apart was that it was a great movie and a great Superhero movie. Well, move over because Avengers did most everything right enough to at least have a discussion of whether Spiderman 1 or Avengers 1 was the better movie. It might have helped that I do not know the Avenger lore as well as I knew others, but everyone else is in agreement. I am reluctant about this statement, because you hear something is the best ever and then it never lives up. I read a lot of hype in these pages before I went and saw it. Now I have seen it and must agree with the hype.One thing I was afraid of: Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk, which I am a little still out on, but I do like Mark Ruffalo, but made Bruce Banner a little too weak/effeminate. It comes together nicely though. Another was ScarJo. Yes, she is sexy enough(understatement) but was she athletic enough to carry it out and she did well enough. Another problem, the bravado/""egos"" of the characters, not stars, but characters of such a movie would demand a lot of screen time for each one to make this work. That would be a problem if it was not accomplished. The movie was very good on this point. Cobie, Robin from How I met Your Mother, was a bit of a distraction for me in a secondary role, but did a competent job.The most interesting thing for me was that Joss Whendon was Director and Writer. He created Buffy/ Angel, Firefly/Dollhouse. I wondered how he would do with such mainstream fair and he managed to bring everything together almost perfectly. I say almost because there is one bit that is missing. It is somewhat minor, but who taught Bruce Banner the secret to control his angry green side. That is the only piece missing for me.For those that want specifics: effects were top notch, acting was excellent, story lines were compelling, the comedy was perfect 99.5% of the time and surprise there were a lot of one line typical superhero zingers that worked really well.I think you will enjoy this movie, unless you only enjoy completely realistic movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Marvel Avenged!,"As I settled in for Marvel's The Avengers (to cite its full title) my mind began to drift back a few years, all the way back to another Marvel action team, The X-Men. I complained then that the problem of multiple superheroes on the screen at the same time is a problem of crowd control. How do you give equal screen time to a handful of characters with special abilities and have them be more than just cardboard characters with colorful powers? The X-Men series never straightened out this problem, but with Marvel's The Avengers, this is not an issue.It was a smart plan for Marvel Studios to build the characters one at a time, giving each superhero their own movie in an effort to introduce them in preparation for their assembly here. As a lead-in we got Iron Man (2008), The Incredible Hulk (2008), Iron Man 2 (2010), and last summer's Thor, and Captain America: The First Avenger - next up is Nick Fury. With that, by the time we get to Marvel's The Avengers most of the heavy lifting in the introduction department is already done for us. That frees up the plot to get past the introductions and get on with the action, although the movie does open with the required scenes in which the team members have to be brought into the fold one by one.The Avengers are more interesting to me than The X-Men because they come from different places. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is Norse God from another galaxy; Captain America (Chris Evans) is a genetically-altered Army strongman from the 1940's; Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) is a green muscle mass hiding out in India under the passive alter ego of Bruce Banner; and Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), is the billionaire metallurgist whose headquarters overlook the Chrysler Building in New York. Plus there's an archer called Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and a token female, Russian-born woman named Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) who, I think, is good with martial arts. For whatever reason, these last two didn't get a movie of their own, but stay tuned.The Avengers, like The X-Men, are also led by a secretive bald-headed authority figure with a handicap. He is Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) who runs a shadow organization called S.H.I.E.L.D., whose function is to stop super villains from . . . well, doing super-villainy I suppose. The task here is to get back an object called the Tesseract, an object that – if I understood it correctly – acts as a power source to open a portal to another galaxy. That's bad news for our planet because it means that the Norse god Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Thor's adopted half-brother, can make his way into our realm and rule the world with his powerful super-army. It also means that he can use it to take control of the minds of certain S.H.I.E.L.D personnel. Loki's first stop to announce his intentions to rule the world: Germany. Maybe he hasn't heard, but that's probably not a wise place to start.The Avenger's personalities are known to us, but what is refreshing is that they are not known to one another. In this movie, many are meeting each other for the first time and no one knows who can be trusted. That's especially true with a tense relationship between Iron Man and Thor. Since he has fallen out of the heavens just like the evil Loki, can he be trusted? Another issue of tension comes with the addition of Bruce Banner. Everyone knows that he has a serious anger management problem and the movie deals nicely with everyone's apprehension that Hulk's destructive nature could be a potential problem.The most engaging character in the film, for me, is Bruce Banner, played this time by Mark Ruffalo, who manages to pull off the best performance out of the past three actors who have occupied the role. Ruffalo plays Banner as a mild-mannered soul who is very aware that he has to keep his mood in check. He does something interesting; he quiets his voice to a calm, mellow, deliberate tone that lets you know that he is aware of the destructive power of what he calls ""The Other Guy."" I liked his rendition of Bruce Banner although I think the screenwriter missed a perfect opportunity to show Bruce living a feng shui lifestyle with meditations and aroma therapy candles in an effort to keep his mood in check (maybe with the mantra ""Keep calm and carry on.""). That might have been perfect.I liked the character touches in Marvel's The Avengers. I liked the dialogue, which is written at a smart, snappy level by writer-director Joss Whedon. He has a way with dialogue that makes even the most mundane of action scenes come alive. He is the man behind ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", ""Firefly"", Toy Story and a brilliant horror-comedy The Cabin in the Woods, still in theaters.I just wish that he could have avoided the trash and bash of the third act. He's a smart writer but the movie goes into the same exact scenario of tearing up the streets and trashing buildings that we've seen a million times. It would have been see the same inventive brilliance as the last act of The Cabin in the Woods and created something that would really take the movie into the realm of something special. His Avengers is best in smaller perfect moments and little flashes of smart dialogue. When you stand back and look at the plot as a whole, you see that it really doesn't add up to much more than just a bunch of superheroes trying to keep a meany from taking over the world. His movie, as it stands, exists somewhere between the ho-hum of The X-Men and the brilliant extravaganza of The Dark Knight. It isn't a perfect film, but I enjoyed it probably more than I expected.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The Hulk, Acting as Bruce Banner and Action as Hulk out of my words...marvelous Thor looked great action was good but acting was better than his action Black Widow, unknown but acting,action both good Hawkeye he was real good in action movie but in here he was OK' Loki acting,action in negative role was real good stuff. Agent Phil Coulson charming and act nicely. Nick Fury he is already expert in actingmovie story, script & direction was real hard job but they did absolute perfect first half story building was good but believe me second half action with climax specially with Iron Man & double special with hulk was great. view on 3D was spectacular. so, watch it on theater.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pretty Friggin' Awesome.,"I was lucky enough to score tickets to a prescreening of The Avengers in my city. I'd loved all the other Marvel movies leading up to it, so I was really stoked.The Avengers is the superhero movie we've been waiting for. Don't get me wrong, I love the darkness of other superhero movies, like The Dark Knight, but as Nick Fury aptly puts it: ""maybe we need a little old-fashioned"". And this movie is exactly that. Joss Whedon gives us precisely what superheroes used to be - extraordinary people fighting their flaws to become the saviors of the human race.In all fairness, The Avengers is not a film that requires much thought. It's a beautiful spectacle, but it definitely does not possess Oscar-worthy performances. It's slightly campy and tongue-in-cheek, which is oddly refreshing. The Avengers never takes itself too seriously, which I think a lot of people aren't getting (hence some extremely scathing reviews on here!)With the exception of Mark Ruffalo, every actor has gotten a chance to explore their characters in a previous movie, which adds to the ""easy-breezy feel"" of the movie. That being said, I thought Mark Ruffalo was a wonderful Bruce Banner -- I'd love to see him in his own movie.The action is non-stop and the CGI is phenomenal. However, this is another case of unnecessary 3D. It's didn't add anything to the effects, except muddle them up on occasion when there was a lot going on. This movie could be shown normally and it would almost be better.Believe the hype. This is an awesome movie. Joss Whedon did an fantastic job with the movie. I can't wait for The Avengers 2.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good but probably the most overrated movie of the year,"I remember this being largely anticipated. I watched the Iron Man movies, so I was going to see this. It had lots of action, but the plot was a little weak. I also didn't understand why they took the villain from Thor and couldn't use someone like Thanos (which is rumored to be the villain for the sequel). Yeah, it had lots of jokes but most of them were too cheesy for me. The best jokes come from Iron Man. It gets a bit boring in the middle part. Overall, I don't think this is a bad movie but I don't think it deserves a spot on the top 250. You should also know I almost never give movies a 10/10. Also the fan base for it is a bit annoying but I should leave that out. The plot is basically a bunch of middle-aged superheroes coming together to fight one of the superhero's brother and his army of Skrulls or Chiatauris if you will. Ruffalo's performance as the Hulk was the best out of any of them, unfortunately there is no Hulk sequel planned for MCU: Phase 2. You should also now know that I've watched all the MCU films and own most of them on DVD. Overall, 8/10. You should also know that I don't hate Marvel and I love them over DC except when it comes to movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Yet another high for the comic book genre,"The ultimate superhero mash up from Marvel Studios.Following the huge success of Iron Man (Robert Downey Junior) and the relative healthy returns for the lesser known Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (now Mark Ruffalo) and Captain America (Chris Evans), the obvious monetary synergy of all four characters in the same movie is obvious.Adding to the mix, we have tight leather clad Black Widow (Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremey Renner) along for the ride, following their brief appearances in the previous films. On Bad guy duties we have Loki (Tom Hiddleston), hell bent on creating a portal to earth to allow his army of minions to flow through and capture the world, making him the undisputed leader of, well everything.On paper this should not really work, we have numerous superheroes all with very different powers, origin stories, character arcs and so forth. Somehow writer and director Joss Whedon, of Buffy and Serenity fame, manages to create a cohesive whole. Each character gets to contribute and have their moment or two in the sun, no-one appears sidelined for too long. The ultimate tag team if you will, even Agent Phil gets his chance to shine.Whedon is far to sharp to allow proceedings to get too pretentious, for every hint of comic book mythology a pin is on hand to puncture the balloon, audiences and characters clearly instructed not to take all this too seriously.Complaints, the film does feel long and there are shades of ""Transformers 3"" in the climactic scenes, have we not done organic alien monsters destroying skyscrapers?The story is largely irrelevant, all the crew are called together by Nick Fury (Samuel LJackson) in full, ""hell yeah"" mode, to defend the earth against this ultimate threat.Loki wields his staff with aplomb, initially stealing away Hawkeye and Selvig (Skellan Skarsgard). We know they are working for the wrong side due to their crazy eyes, until of course they experience some cognitive repair surgery, or get bashed on the head, dependent on your medical training.The effects are top notch, production values off the scale and it is obvious the director has a firm grip on the material and belief in his characters. All participants appear to be having a whole lot of fun and it comes across on the screen.Who would have thought a few years ago that cast lists of this quality would be lining up to play Comic Book heroes, how times and story lines have changed.So to the characters.Stark is just Stark, every mans wish fulfillment, rich beyond dreams, able to ignore anyone and everyone, good with the ladies but now settled with the radiant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Thor continues to talk in Nordic God like speak, which never gets old. The trusty hammer Mjolnir gets a good work out here, incidentally Natalie Portman's character is referenced but not shown on screen.Captain America is tried and true, embodying a dependable ""old world"" can do attitude, which is a pleasant antidote to Iron Man's showy pursuits. Evans does well here, actually anchoring the character somewhere firm amongst all the chaos.Strangely the character that should not work at all, just maybe steals the show. The ""Hulk"" whose character development in real life now has morphed through three ""A"" list actors, is the obvious crowd pleaser. He also gets the best two laughs in the film and the least expensive wardrobe, just a torn shirt and some cut off jeans.The Hulk is played rather well by Ruffalo, bringing something to the role that Norton or Bana did not find. The big guy remains under wraps for quite some time but when he gets angry, he sure makes some mess.Clearly the studio are thinking big, stay for the set up as it is clear the ""Avengers"" work is not done yet.SummaryYet another high for the comic book genre, post modern and self knowing in the approach, this works better than anyone might have dared to expect.Big, loud, expensive comic book superhero mashup. Not to be taken seriously, just enjoyed for the spectacle on show and the obvious thought, care and intelligence invested in the series.Recommendedhttp://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A pure instant classic and as epic as it deserves to be.,"I'm glad to see the response to Marvel's The Avengers (Damn that Uma Thurman movie for making me have to print the full title) has been VERY VERY positive. If there was ever a case for expectations being unreasonable then this was it. Also, we always get some anal fans that are too attached to their comic book preconceived notions. Either Avengers stayed very close to its root origins or people are judging it as the fine film it turned out to be. It's both to be honest and it seems most enjoyed it as much as I did. Anyone worried that Joss Whedon would make something this epic look like TV work needs worry no more. Visually it is a sight to behold and as epic as it deserves to be. I don't remember when I enjoyed a film THIS much and I really loved a lot of 2011's offerings. This movie just hits the highest level possible for me. It works on all of its own terms, there's no weighted enjoyment or cinematic slumming involved in enjoying it. It really IS a smart action film and the cast really delivered as expected. With this exceptional cast involved, how could it not? Whedon knew who his aces were and how to play them. Downey and Jackson are CLASSIC. That's not to say every major character didn't shine at one point it's just that when the beats mattered, the big guns when front and center. I also LOVED what Whedon did with Loki and how much of a home run Tom Hiddleston hit. Avengers truly a remarkable movie treat and I'm glad to see that the majority of film fans agree with me. The movie works on so many levels and makes you draw on just about all of your emotions. Best of all, you leave the theater smiling and completely wanting more.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Entertaining. Should not disappoint the masses.,"The Avengers is exactly what I expected. It is action packed, it understandably doesn't have much time for character development (although we do see more of Hawkeye and Black Widow than in previous Marvel installments), and the relentless action is accompanied by some fairly good jokes to ease the tension here and there - especially by Tony Stark and, surprisingly, the Hulk (they actually managed to throw in at least two genuinely funny moments around Hulk's utter brutality).The lack of character development, especially for Thor (who does seem somewhat out of place in this film) but also Bruce Banner, is probably what hurts The Avengers the most. I didn't actually need any character development since I've seen all previous Marvel films at least twice, but it nonetheless does stand as a drawback - it feels wrong even though I was expecting it considering the number of characters already established. I can hardly imagine anyone who hasn't seen the previous films enjoying The Avengers because of that.I usually don't care that much for relentless CGI action films, but some sequences in The Avengers were so blatantly incredible that I had to enjoy them. Notably, a sequence during the huge battle sees the camera pan from one Avenger kicking butt to the other - that was really well done and exciting. Loki was once again a brilliant villain and the perfect choice for the first Avengers film.Overall, a very good action ride bringing our favorite superheros together. The movie doesn't try to be pretentious and goes straight to business - which is what it should do.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Marvel from Marvel,"Absolutely Brilliant!!!!...not a single dull moment in this movie. Great to see Robert Downey Jr. after Sherlock Holmes...right on the button. He is having amazing sense of representing Tony Stark in the Iron Man franchise and now in The Avengers. Captain America, Thor were fabulous in this movie. The action was top notch. Scarlett was OK and I missed Edward Norton as Hulk although Mark has done an excellent job as Hulk especially with some of his interactions with other super heroes. I wish Hawk Eyes character would have been given better treatment. He was lost in the crowd of super heroes. All greats ensemble to form this wonderful movie. Go watch and enjoy all the super heroes of America!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the best films I've ever seen. A MUST SEE!,"Like many people, who have been fast forwarding the credits to see the teasing snippet at the end in the Iron Man films, Thor, Captain America etc, I was ridiculously excited to see this film. I'll hold my hands up now and admit that I am a huge sci-fi nerd and regard Thor and Iron Man 1 as two of my favourite ever films (along with titles such as the recent Star Trek, or the Lord of the Rings trilogy). Needless to say, I was not disappointed. This film was, there's only one way to put this... INCREDIBLE! The special effects were out of the world, literally the best effects I have ever seen, on a larger scale than the most recent Transformers film, but less in your face and over powering. The effects were first rate, completely seamless and is definitely something to watch on the big screen, rather than wait for the DVD.I found that the acting was really good as well, everyone pulling their weight with a big nod towards Tom Hiddleston who i believe was one of the stars of the show. Definitely the best Hulk there has ever been and Chris Hemsworth was utterly fantastic. Needless to say, Robert Downey Jr will deserve all the plaudits he takes from this film as he was brilliant, as always, in his role of Tony Stark. Even Scarlett Johansson, who many assumed would just be ""token bo__"" was really good and her character had surprising depth.This is one of those films where you cant help but smile while watching it as you follow an incredible story line while witnessing faultless special affects. I cannot recommend this film enough, I have seen it once at the cinema and have already booked tickets to go see it again. The phrase ""a must see"" has not been as relevant since Lord of the Rings, People..GO SEE THIS FILM!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What we've all been waiting for,"This movie is what every comic book movie has ever wished it could be. It has everything the audience wanted and more. Not just an exploding good time but a legitimately good film. It's well written, has character and plot development, stunning visual effects, fantastic action sequences, and most importantly, the avengers themselves. My favorite thing about the introduction of the characters is that they don't all appear at once. The avengers come together one at a time planning to accomplish their own goals at first, only discover that they all have a common enemy and the world needs them. It's a smart and good pace that the film follows allowing the audience to breath a little. The cast acts their parts in a way that comic book films almost never succeed in. They have dynamic and rope you in every second. You can even put aside Captain America's dorky costume because everything about this movie is so good. Best part? No romantic crap in this movie. Everything is short, simple, and to the stuff we care about.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
avengers and their team work,"The Avengers Since we can remember, there has always been that one person who we always looked up too. That person we believed was our hero, the one person who would always run to our rescue, whenever we called upon them. It wouldn't matter what the situation was; unfortunately as the years pass our hero's change. We become to know the real definition of a hero and our deception of them changes, a hero, which is a person, typically a man, who is admired for courage or noble qualities. Such as the character or characters in a book, play, or movie who have these noble qualities. Throughout the movie the Avengers, we learn that being a hero is not the easiest thing, it takes a lot of courage, time, hard ships and team work to accomplish the most impossible. As we see, when the heroic team, Iron Man, Hulk, Captain America, and Thor is reunited on the ship for the first time; tensions were high as we expected. They all had a different plan and understanding on how to defend their world and to take down Loki. Their inability to come together and be a team at first is a major factor is their main source of vulnerability and the outcome of Loki being five steps ahead of them. It isn't until one of their own is killed by Loki; that they actually become the Avengers. They put all their differences behind them and finally suit up to stop Loki from taking over their world. The courage each of them has to sacrifice themselves in order to make sure our world is safe is indescribable. The unstoppable force that forms when they all put their special talents and gifts together are unbreakable, their allegiance to one another is their upper hand to taking down Loki. In their finale desperation is stopping Loki and closing the portal, the viewer's get a glance at what a little bit of team work and courage and a passion for something can get you. Their team work got them to close the portal, each Avenger's courage is the reason they saved the world. And finally, their passion and pursuit to stop Loki was their unbreakable bond formed throughout the movie. Overall, the movie The Avengers, was not only made to show the comic story of the heroic team stopping Loki from taking over our world but also to show everyone what team work and courage can get you in life. You don't have to be the smartest or the strongest but if you have a big heart and a strong passion for something, don't let anyone stop you from achieving those goals. Even if it maybe you saving the world from an evil villain.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Just as i expected,"like i thought so...the characters simply cant be in one movie. It degrades each character because each one has its own environment. Iron man in the technological world...Captain America's character i still cant understand..he is only got that freaking shield that is unique about him. I mean seriously what kinda superhero is he. Thor and his gods which belong somewhere in lord of the ring or something. Hulk who exists due to some chemical reactions and interactions or gamma rays. Each character has a different theme and environment. Bringing them together isn't right. The acting of most of the actors was normal, actually at times it felt they were in a play not a movie. the story is abit silly or i should say typical. It felt like this was a Walt Disney movie and ironically enough it turned out to be a Walt Disney movie, But on the other hand ....the special effects were amazing and there were some funny scenes. Anyway, out of 10 i would give it 6. But well...i have my own taste. I wouldn't probably go for the 2nd sequel of it. I would most likely recommend this to 20 year olds and below.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It is a must see film which will give you an urge to go for the second time as well.,"Avengers turned out to be as thrilling and exciting as its first teaser. I was waiting for this movie from the time they announced it and my joy knew no bounds when I saw the movie tonight. In one word – Superb. I don't mind watching it once again. S.H.I.E.L.D director, Nick Fury is threatened by Loki and his armed forces. Loki is sinister brother of Thor who was dethroned from Kingdom of Asgard for his misdeeds. He plans an attack on Earth by opening a portal through which his army can arrive into the Earth from Asgard and wage a war against mankind and turn human into Loki's slave. In order to protect Earth from destruction, Nick Fury assembles a team of superheroes represented by Ironman , Captain America , Thor and Hulk along with Black Widow and HawkEye. Together , they must fight the evil Loki before he captures the people of earth and turns them into his slave It would have been really challenging for Joss Whedon, director of Serenity, to make a film by assembling all the superheroes in one flick but to my surprise he did a fantastic job and turned this comic-story into a must-see film. The movie begins by introducing each superhero character and their personalities. Of course, if you would have followed their original parts then this will be easy to continue. The differences between the characters has been portrayed ecstatically. 1st half is more of story building where as it is the 2nd half which gathers steam and makes it more entertaining. Couple of scenes that easily stands out are the introduction of Hulk , the fight between Thor and Ironman and especially the climax scenes where the main fighting is depicted. Screenplay is effective along with punching dialogues Cinematography is enthralling. The CGI is magnificent with thrilling visual effects. On the flip side , any superhero movie is supported by electrifying background which is clearly missing here. Nevertheless, it is compensated by powerful performances by rest of the starcast. Robert Downey Jr. clearly stands out in his portrayal of Ironman and witty one- liners. He is just getting better with each film. Surprisingly, I liked Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/The Hulk. His puts in so much effort and is complete natural when as Bruce Banner and his change of expression as The Hulk. Overall , an action-packed entertainment with good storyline , lovely performances and superb CGI. It is a must see film which will give you an urge to go for the second time as well. Excellent 4/5",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Avengers is a great popcorn flick.,"I must Marvel the way the movie has been received worldwide, our poor cousins in the US get to see it a week later.. feels good for a change.Coming to the movie, A wonderful ensemble of superheros out to save the world from a maverick God who is on the hunt for a certain cube with infinite energy source to make weapons of mass destruction with which he will provide humans freedom from freedom. Seems quite a mouthful that.A gunfire underwhelming start with Loki the God escaping with the Cube quite callously provides us with the excuse to get the Avenger cast together. And so follows the tryst with good vs evil. As one scene follows the other in mundane logical sequence, The super heroes flaunt their wares with aplomb. Wit and humor coinciding with every innuendo in the action sequences. Robots mechanical serpents and the Incredible Hulk!A fun and thrill spectacle in spectacular 3D. Wow the popcorn felt great too.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Passable time and brain cell killer.,"Loud and overlong with minimal character and plot development and casual banter among the characters that feels more like a run through. Likewise, the conflict and plot don't really seem to matter, and there is no tension, suspense or pacing. Each scene is on same level as the one before; you could watch this film with the scenes arranged in virtually any order. This thing totally lacks momentum. The expensive cast does well enough, but the film's length and one-dimensional plot grows tiresome and the noisy soundtrack seems designed to prevent dozing. The Avengers is not particularly recommendable, nothing about it is memorable or original and it's not a film I feel any need to revisit. It's a passable time killer; nothing more.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's no Dark Knight but it sits comfortably at the number 2 spot.,"There isn't really much plot going on here but what there is plenty of is character depth, Joss Whedon does a fantastic job of giving these characters so many levels that we never knew they had. This added depth to the characters really causes us too feel for them in their moment of hardships. The character I ended up empathising for the most was actually Black Widow which actually surprised me a great deal. But that's thing that Whedon does really well, he is used to developing characters and yet again his fantastic writing does it again here. Now if you had your doubts about Joss Whedon's directing ability then let me reassure you that you can put those fears to bed. Some of the shots he creates are absolutely stunning making for what will be some very iconic scenes from the movie. Not only did Joss Whedon direct this action filled roller coaster he also put pen to paper and wrote it, as I said the plot isn't exceptional but the dialogue is utter brilliance. Every word out of Tony Stark's mouth is absolutely hilarious making this funnier than a lot of comedies I have seen.Everyone knows the standard of the acting that is typically found in these Marvel movies, it's pretty good but nothing really amazing. Robert Downey Jr. obviously returns as the obnoxious and downright funny billionaire, Tony Stark. Everyone has seen this role before so you don't really see anything new here but you know what, that doesn't mean it hasn't gotten old. As usual Robert Downey Jr. performs brilliantly, displaying one of the best performances of the movie adding some comedy to an otherwise action filed adventure.Downey Jr. isn't the only one that shines here, Mark Ruffalo – who I am a huge fan of – plays Bruce Banner/ the Hulk brilliantly making for my personal favourite Hulk's we have seen to date and there is nothing I wish more than for him to get his own movie after this, but we all know that isn't going to happen. Ruffalo also supplies us with many laughs throughout the movie and he also gives us a collection of the best action sequences in the whole movie with his ""Hulk smash!""We see the return of Tom Hiddleston as the menacing Loki and he plays the role absolutely beautifully. The first shot we get of Loki is harrowing which is mastered by the combination of Hiddleston's devilish performance and Whedon's gorgeous directing. Loki not only makes for a horrifying villain but his chemistry between Downey Jr. as Iron Man is priceless. If you weren't fond of Loki in Thor – like I wasn't – your mind will be changed here he truly is an evil person making for an iconic villain.Chris Evans and Hemsworth show us the performance you expect from seeing them in their individual Marvel movies, they aren't show stopping but are good enough for this movie. I feel as though the best moments of acting are when all of the Avengers are together, the chemistry between them is perfect, they all have their own different relationship between each other that can swap from hatred to best friends in a matter of minutes.Now the one thing that you don't have to worry about in this movie is any of the main characters being pushed aside. When I first saw the trailer I thought that this will end up being Iron Man & Co. but trust me it isn't, all of the characters you want to get all the screen time they deserve. Maria Hill played by the brilliant Cobie Smulders is one of the very few characters that gets pushed to the side, but she was never really regarded as one of the main characters although I would have liked it if she had a bit more ass kicking to do. Pepper Potts played by Gwyneth Paltrow makes a brief appearance which literally lasts a minute but you don't really care about that as this movie really isn't about her.The Avengers isn't exactly perfect, there was one thing I wasn't too fond of and that is that these movies are starting to feel far too familiar. Apart from the stature of this movie in comparison with others it doesn't really vary it's self from the other Marvel movies – Paramount Pictures – the direction has the same old comic book action style which you can spot in all the other movies. This isn't necessarily a bad thing but I can see many people starting to tire of it.I feel as though it is usually useless and extremely overpriced, the same can be said here. I didn't feel as though the 3D was necessary, if it was it would have been filmed in 3D and not post converted like most films are these day. The 3D wasn't used like Avatar to fully engross me in the world, it just felt like it was there and there was nothing really too it, I know I would have enjoyed the film just as much in 2D.The thing The Avengers does best is what it set out to do. It isn't trying to be a dark superhero movie with a serious tone – like The Dark Knight – and that's good because trying to compete with that is a ridiculous thing to do. The Avengers tries to be a comic book action-filled, Hollywood blockbuster and you know what it does that perfectly.Trust me, if you are a fan of superhero movies then you will fall in love with this movie, it is the movie we all wanted and expected, Joss Whedon has done us all proud and for that I would like to him, thank you very much. This is the perfect start to a Summer filled with brilliant movies.If you enjoyed you can check out many more at: http://moviesoclock.wordpress.com/",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Most Awaited Movie Turns Out to be The Most Epic,"I don't care about what some people say on how this movie just had action and no story and cheesy humor because those people obviously have no taste. Anyways, I just got a chance to see the most awaited film of 2012 and honestly, I wasn't disappointed. The movie was actually the most epic movie I have seen so far. Yes, I might change this decision after I see The Dark Knight Rises or MIB 3 but this movie has certainly impressed me. The movie has major plus points and one of them is the dialogs. The mix of action and humorous dialogs entertain and provide good moments to appease the audiences. I am sure, several people loved the dialogs but I just admired them. The action scenes, were not overdone and were certainly better than G.I Joe series which was not really anything impressive for me. But, there is a lot more to this film that gave me that feeling that this is the epic movie and It wasn't a waste to wait for so long. The action scenes are good, though there was a lot of explosions, they impress. The best part is the acting, our superheroes and even our villain say funny dialogs and perform good action. Plus, the story is effective for a 2 hour movie as many movies longer than 1 hour 30 mins are usually lagging in parts and fail to present a good story. But, this movie doesn't drag and doesn't make you fall asleep. Acting is top notch, Robert Downy Jr. is the best, Thor is good, Captain America, the rest are awesome. In general, this movie was damn good. I wasn't bored, and I enjoyed every freaking moment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Eye candy, and eye candy only","The Avengers has been the trend for the past few days. Everybody had only good things to say about the movie, and so I decided to watch it. Well, it was not that good, not for me at least.The film is a visual extravaganza, competing on the number of villains and visual graphics scene by scene. If that is what you want from a movie, then don't read the rest, just go and watch the movie, you won't be disappointed.But what the movie really lacks is a good solid storyline. It is as if the director wanted the movie to feature this much of characters and they should all get the same amount of screen time, let it be at the expense of the story! That is the main issue with the movie.Upto the interval, the movie just drags on, the usual stuff with the villain trying to steal an energy source and the superhero team assembling to get it back. There is another interesting thing here. The villain actually tries to manipulate the team and let them fight each other, and this goes on and on and on in the first half. Really, absolutely boring with clichés all over. No creativity of any sort.In a superhero movie, one thing we expect is the introduction of the superheroes. Well, introduction???? There was no such thing, they just walked on to the scene saying, ""Hi, there"". No thrill, no excitement , no sheer blood rushing through the veins scene.And some people were there for no reason at all. I do not know what Black Widow and Captain America did. They just felt like minnows compared to the Hulk and Thor and co.The cast was good anyway. Well they are not doing their roles for the first time, are they? so no credit there to the Avengers Team. Jeremie Renner, Scarlet Johansson and Robert Downey Jr were superb.After the interval, the movie gains some pace and it is all action. This is where the movie becomes watchable. Actually I liked the second half of the movie. Action does not need story or dialogues, does it? May be that is why. And last but not the least, is that guy Loki really a villain or a joker?? Is that what a villain is? never terrifying, not even for a 2-year-old. and in the end """"""Spoiler alert"""""""""""" Hulk thrashes him and says ""puny god"". some villain, ha???!!!I am a big fan of superhero movies. In my opinion the best superhero movie released recently was X-Men First Class. Compared to that this is absolute crap, I would say. These guys made a movie which is to be their masterpiece, to which they put their money and effort limitlessly and it came out disfigured like this?, wow!!!!!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Avengers Dissassembled,"By now it's probably all been said before, so I'm really just adding weight to the views on both sides of the nerd-gasm that was The Avengers.Entertainment is the name of the game here, and Whedon doesn't hold back for a minute, throwing brawling superheroes, invading aliens, and wide-scale destruction at the screen throughout its running time.Some of the character interplay, particularly between Tony Stark (Iron Man) and Bruce Banner (Hulk) are a joy to watch, with the former's acerbic put-downs (Thor is dubbed 'Point Break', and Captain America is renamed 'Rock of Ages') injecting fun into what could have otherwise been a joyless jaunt between explosions.The acting is credible overall, with Mark Ruffalo perfectly characterising Bruce Banner as the embodiment of all that the Hulk is not (awkward, reserved, quiet), Robert Downey Jnr channelling Stark's usual suave arrogance, and Tom Hiddleson's Loki permeating charm and menace in equal measure (Banner comments ""you can smell crazy on him"" at one point).These are all positives I'd been expecting from the man who wowed me with Firefly and Serenity, and my wife with Buffy.Unfortunately, there are quite a few problems as well, even for a comic book fan such as myself.Firstly, there's some seriously lumpen exposition, particularly the juvenile intro scene where the alien 'plan to invade' is bullet-pointed for the audience, in case we can't follow the basic premise. I fully expected a white board and felt markers to be used at any second. The end-credit scene is in a similar vein, and is equally cringe-worthy.A pet-hate of mine (and my wife's) is a lack of logic, and The Avengers excels in this area, with 1. The base explosion near the intro, completely unexplained, just to be accepted, 2. Loki brainwashing/controlling his 'minions' by tapping their hearts (rather than their heads, where their 'minds' are (doh!)) with his staff, and 3. Why there are numerous scenes in which the invading aliens don't open fire at the clearly exposed cops, civilians and heroes they are flying over (are they saving ammo?).Another point to consider is the absence of the National Guard. Were they off on holiday that day?By some margin, though, the greatest gripe I have with The Avengers, is the lack of genuine threat that Loki and his army poses to, not just the Avengers themselves, but to any modern army.While Loki is more than capable of taking care of Captain America (then again, who isn't?), he is quite clearly no match for Hulk, Thor or Iron Man, who each take turns in highlighting this fact. In my experience of superheroes, it's paramount to play the 'heroes' as the underdogs, who must face and overcome a challenge that, at first, seems beyond them. This is what makes for exciting (and unpredictable) entertainment.In The Avengers, there's no point at which we're under any illusion that Loki and his horde will fail, nor is there any need for concern over our heroes, since they are the overwhelming favourites to rise triumphant.All that said, I didn't feel short-changed when I left the cinema, and this is coming from someone who generally avoids Hollowood movies. Maybe some of the more abrasive critics of the movie are right - some of us are just nerdy and want to see characters with incredible powers knock the crap out of each other.Although I can understand where a rating of 8.8 has come from (over-enthusiastic fan-boys fresh from the cinema, typing up their reviews BEFORE changing their trousers), I can't add to it. The Avengers isn't Pan's Labyrinth, or Amelie, and in this context, it can't reach top spot or anywhere near it. If you're giving a movie with this numerous faults a full score, you're clearly in need of watching some genuinely well-crafted movies.It's not clever, but it is BIG!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
3D effects were great but plot was lacking,"The 3D effects in the movie were second to none but the ""story"" consisted of mainly just conflict after conflict. There was nothing truly intelligent about the plot or any of the twists. It is worth watching to see the effects, especially Iron Man flying around. They did a great job of making you feel like you were in the action.I'm disappointed with the IMDb rating and feel that the studios are now finding ways to game the ratings system by adding a bunch of paid propaganda.

#Movie Review,"The past movies Iron Man 1 & 2, Hulk, Captain America, Thor have built up the hype for this big movie and Marvel definitely DELIVERED!This movie is AMAZING! The visuals are astonishing, Marvel mastered the art of implementing clever funny high quality jokes in their films and this movie is no exception, also they made good use of the 2h so that even though there are plenty of heroes in this movie they still managed to give them enough screen time so that they all feel relevant to the movie. Every action scene in this movie is important, Marvel makes sure to establish that stakes are high with a beautifully crafted smart and complex plot especially with the scene on the plane. Also the movie is full of suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat!One thing to note is that I actually enjoyed Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner I feel like he is the right man for the job.Conclusion : 10/10 !",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A phenomenal movie that handles its characters well,"This movie perfectly deals with the past 6 avengers that have either made cameos in movies or had movies developing there backstory, personality and morals. This movies takes those characters and creates a huge conflict between themselves and makes the characters flaws and later skills much much more clearer. The movie gives each character a good amount of screen time and makes you care for them and be interested to watch them grow and succeed. The villain is also amazing as he is extremely funny and very clever by using each avengers weakness against them and the team making the team fight each other causing good action and good story telling. The movie is a relatively simple story in the long run but it is still perfectly made, funny and has great characters that are all given some form of development.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A great start for the Avengers,"The Avengers is a movie that has been in the making for the years that have come and gone. After finally making its worldwide debut, it paid off in a big way and helped make not only cinematic history for itself, but for the MCU itself for what was to come. After Loki comes to Earth to steal the Tesseract to open a portal from space that will release a alien army, Nick Fury has no options than to finally launched the long awaited avengers initiative to save humanity as we know it. Robert Downey Jr returns once again as Iron Man to help put the avengers initiative into full motion. Chris Evans returns as well as Captain America after being frozen in ice for decades who is still trying to adjust to the new and improved world to also help recover the Tesseract. Chris Hemsworth returns as Thor to help bring a end to Loki's terror on Earth and bring him home. Mark Ruffalo takes over from Edward Norton's Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk and I much like his portrayal a bit better than Edward Norton's just, because I feel like he captures Banners/Hulks likeness a little bit better like it should be. Scarlett Johansson returns as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow to save Clint Barton/Hawkeye played by Jeremy Renner who is under a type of hypnosis by Loki's control and bring him back to fight on the avengers side. Tom Hiddleston is more menacing and terrifying than ever as Loki, making his performance in this one of my favorite villains in the MCU. This film is full of action, thrills, comedy, and sci-fi that will keep you the edge of your seat all the way until the end. Rating 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
8.6? What  for?,"I like super hero movies; if well made they are lots of fun. If they are done by a Master-they are very good (The Latest Batman, the first X-men,the 1st Spider Man). I watched all of the characters in this movie in their previous solo's: enjoyed Iron Man the most (Robert Downy Jr. is one of the best actors ever); thought that Thor was very entertaining and funny (and definitely a pleasure to look at...);I enjoyed the last Hulk with E.Norton, and watched Cpt.America @ home (saved on the ticket...)and thought it was OK.We went to watch it after seeing the rating. SO: This movie is entertaining, if you like lots of CGIs and action; there is NO Original/Surprising story. The acting is good (they brought GOOD Actors, you wouldn't expect less). We laughed twice (The Hulk character provided the much needed relief). You will enjoy it on a big screen. BUT THAT'S IT. 8.6? Really? How many times you can watch Manhattan destroyed?! Time and time again in every other CGI movie.Grow up and get more original.(And Yes,AVATAR was better). I gave it a 5 to lower the expectations of people who go to watch a movie on the big screen,instead of watching it @ home.If you like CGIs and a predicted plot it deserves between 6-7. If you expect a masterpiece like THE DARK KNIGHT,-this is NOT. It's not even IRON MAN the 1st. It was very disappointing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Modern Blockbuster,"Probably the most important blockbuster of the 21st century so far. This generation's Star Wars (1977). A cultural landmark that proved individual stories serving a unifying purpose can be told within a cinematic universe, a feat that many studios have tried to replicate but failed, and something that the MCU struggles with today.The biggest challenge that The Avengers (2012) would face is having to balance the immense stardom that comes with the previous five films, which all lead up to this moment. A moment that would make or break the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the moment when six individual and leading multi-layered superhero characters would share the silver screen together for the first time.What makes this film work so well is Joss Whedon's screenplay, a highlight of the film that respects and values each character, their motivations, and their overall arcs. Even all the jokes, iconic lines, and quips feel organic and true to each persona. The lab scene where all the main characters present argue and clash over different things beautifully captures the perfect synergy between the different characters. It's my favourite scene in the film and probably the most well-written one in the MCU, which establishes so much in so little time.From a technical aspect, the visual effects are still as remarkable as they were ten years ago when I first saw the film. Hulk's design is drastically improved from his stand-alone feature and is my favourite incarnation of the character in the MCU. Stark's suits always look incredible and it's a shame that in Infinity War and Endgame, they are less practical and just worse. Captain America's suit is goofy as hell, and overall, the other visuals or designs do not stand out, but the film does choose to take a safe, bright, well-light approach to its cinematography and aesthetic, instead of a specific look.There's nothing I don't like about the film, and there's undoubtedly a lot of nostalgia packed into it at this point, but it always feels fresh and exciting whenever I see any scene. The one shot during the battle of New York is one of the most glorious comic book film moments ever. You just can't not have fun with this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"great fights, good jokes, but bad story / idea","I watched this movie after reading the reviews.

After only fighting for less than an hour, and they suddenly launch a Nuclear Missile?How come the Avengers were very easy to gather each other in the battlefield in a large city? (alrite, ironman can fly)And they should add ""Independence Day"" fighting to create a great massive fight against the alien.And all of the aliens are dead after the host were blown up? that was too easy..The Dark Knight were ten times better than thisBut I give this 7 out of 10 for the jokes and the acting",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Action only film about comic book superheroes uniting,"All I can say is I am stunned that this terrible movie has been given a rating above 2 or 3 by anyone. And to read this film grossed over $600MM makes me lack faith in the movie public. The Avengers has virtually no character development or plot. It basically is non stop chase scenes and things exploding, with an extreme amount of loud noise. I don't think there were more than several quiet, dialog times the entire movie. I kept thinking that the movie would settle down and get to a meaningful story, but it did not happen. I even was watching it in 3D but that did not help. If one wants to go see continual actions stunts and things exploding, then this is the movie for you.

Best Superhero team up movie to date,"And that is all mostly due to all the previous ground work laid out by Marvel Studios. Pay attention, Warner Bros!!. This is how it's done!! . In order for this to work, some character development has to be put into place in the form of stand-alone movies giving the chance to each and every one of the team's member characters to shine and for us, the audience, to get to know them. Whether all these stand-alone movies have been up to snuff or not, is irrelevant. What it is relevant, is that the audience has had a chance to know them and therefore, care about what happens to them. And in that, this movie excells. Not only are all the characters given a chance to shine, but it also shows what a talented group of crew members and director can achieve when all the stars align. Very well written story, strong performances, an epic score by Alan Silvestri, state-of-the-art special and visual effects and a very fast, but not one bit rushed, pace, make this the best Avengers movie to date.

Amazing,"The Avengers, a superhero symphony that had me fist-pumping like a Marvel fanatic. The ensemble cast, from Robert Downey Jr.'s snarky Tony Stark to Scarlett Johansson's kick-ass Black Widow, is a powerhouse of charisma and chemistry, each hero shining in their own right. The film editing is a whirlwind of action, seamlessly interweaving larger-than-life battles with character-driven moments that give the narrative heart. Strengths? The seamless blending of individual hero stories into a cohesive team dynamic, a superhero jigsaw puzzle that fits together flawlessly. Weaknesses? Occasionally, the plot might hover on the edge of over-the-top, but hey, it's a superhero extravaganza, and we love it that way. The music, Alan Silvestri's score, is the pulse of heroism, swelling with each iconic entrance and saving the world crescendo. Cinematography captures the grandeur of the Marvel universe, from the soaring heights of Stark Tower to the depths of Loki's mischief. The message? A celebration of teamwork, diversity, and the idea that even the most disparate heroes can come together for the greater good. 8/10 is a superhero salute to its exhilarating entertainment, a film that not only assembles Earth's mightiest heroes but also assembles a solid spot in the pantheon of superhero epics.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not as good/bad as they say,"Let me start by saying that I did in fact enjoy this movie. However, 8.whatever is FARRRRRRRRRR from accurate. You're meaning to tell me this ranks up there with films like The Godfather and Shawshank Redemption? Come on now.There were some really good parts. There were some almost unbelievably bad parts.(First 10-20 min. was like watching another flick entirely) Acting was up and down, but overall it wasn't bad by any means. dialogue was spotty, but had some good lines and few laughs. LOADS of CGI but the action was intense AF. So at the end of the day, it's entertaining. I couldn't watch it 5-6 times, but none the less entertaining.Now for those who can't seem to understand how ratings work. Was it the best movie you have EVER saw? No? OK, don't rate it 10/10. Was it the worst movie you have EVER saw? No? OK, don't rate it 1/10. Simple. And for those expecting some original, new, fresh plot and amazingly moving dialogue. Seriously?

Time to assemble one into many,"It has finally happened! Marvel has done what has never been done before. It has taken numerous franchises of its comics and brought them all together on the big screen, and it was magnificent. Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk, SHIELD, and Captain America have come together to form the Avengers.There was doubt about the Hulk in this movie considering the two disappointments in the previous Hulk movies. But this was the greatest Hulk in comparison to all previous Hulks. Mark Ruffalo, who plays the role of Dr. Bruce Banner, is a perfect match. He really redefined the not only Dr. Banner, but also the Hulk. Well done Marvel.The drama between the heroes as the Avengers was forming was super, but it was short lived. The fight between Iron Man and Thor was cool, but it leaves a person wanting more. Later on, the Hulk and Thor fought, and it was awesome to see it on the big screen. It was also a little short, but it may have taken from the Avengers story if it were any longer.The battle in New York was incredible. The Hulk was funny with his smashing tactics.

Assembled awesomeness,"Since the dawn of men, we aspired to be heroes. We told each other stories of strong and smart men who fought in legendary battles, stood against fearsome beasts and saved beautiful damsels in distress. Since the 20s of the last century, some people have been writing such stories down in the form of comic books and graphic novels. Two of the people who did this were Stan Lee and Jack Kirby at Marvel Comics. The created among others the rich genius in a flying suit called Iron Man, the super soldier called Captain America, a new version of thunder god Thor, two spies under the names Black Widow and Hawkeye and of course the man that turns into a big, green, angry monster which calls itself Hulk. Comics like this were made into movies, but nearly all of them had some flaws. They weren't like the comics, took themselves to serious, made to much jokes or had some other flaws. Now a pretty unknown director takes a few famous heroes of Marvel (see above) and makes a movie with them with does no mistakes the other movies made.

Though enhanced human in some way, shape or form, they just aren't in the same class of ""super"" hero as the previously mentioned three. In fact, they aren't ""super"" at all. I would think that each of them, in succession, would have been squashed by something thrown at them by one of the warriors from another planet. 2) The ""suiting-up"" process for Ironman is starting to become a little silly and I didn't like the shape change of the power plant in the middle of his chest from a circle to a triangle. 3) The Hulk goes from a mindless...well...HULK, to a character who then helps ""the team""...pick pick pick......After you see it I'm sure you'll agree that this movie is definitely NOT an 8.8 as movies go...but the ratings system at this venue has ALWAYS been flawed. If you don't read too much into it, it's pretty solid entertainment especially if you're an action fan, Marvel fan, or a fan of any of the actors involved and worth seeing on the big screen ....especially because the sound systems seem to have been upgraded in recent times...........but I wouldn't pay more than matinée price.P.S.....there is an additional ""snippet"" of movie inserted into the credit roll so don't exit too quickly......The only thing that really ticked me off was the $7. price tag for a MEDIUM popcorn !?....get real, people........... .I rate it 7",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Action scenes are therefore boring because you know the outcome 99/100 times. I laugh at why they even bother shooting guns at these guys. Do they really expect us to be on the edge of our seats? Yes, the visuals are decent but that's not what makes a movie. When comparing this film to Guardians of the Galaxy, it's no contest.

Avengers Assemble!!,"""The Avengers"" is a 2012 adventure/action film directed by Joss Whedon and starring an ensemble cast that includes Robert Downey Jr. As Iron Man, Chris Evans as Captain America, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk, and Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye. The movie follows these superheroes as they come together to save the world from an alien invasion led by the villainous Loki (Tom Hiddleston).One of the strongest aspects of the movie is the chemistry between the cast. Each actor brings their own unique take on their character, and their interactions with one another are both humorous and engaging. The film's action scenes are also impressive, with a mix of practical and digital effects used to create thrilling set pieces.The plot is well-crafted and engaging, with a good balance between action, character development, and humor. The movie does a great job of juggling its large ensemble cast, giving each character their own moment to shine while also moving the overall plot forward.The direction by Whedon is confident and assured, with a strong visual style and a keen sense of pacing. The cinematography by Seamus McGarvey is also impressive, with a mix of handheld shots and steady compositions that give the film a sense of energy and momentum.The musical score by Alan Silvestri is a standout, with a memorable main theme and well-placed motifs that help to elevate the film's emotional moments.However, the film's villain, Loki, can feel somewhat underdeveloped at times. While Tom Hiddleston brings a sense of charisma and wit to the role, the character's motivations and backstory are not always clear, making him a somewhat one-dimensional antagonist.Overall, ""The Avengers"" is an entertaining adventure/action movie that succeeds in bringing together some of Marvel's most beloved characters on the big screen. With strong performances, impressive action scenes, and a well-crafted plot, it is a highlight of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a must-see for fans of the franchise.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"AVENGERS, Time to Suit Up.","This Marvel Studios film, is the best superhero film we've been waiting for, so long for everyone to watch and have a whole lots of fun with Superheroes.

"Inadvertently Hilarious, Entertaining Movie","It is quite unfortunate that after Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk, the Marvel films switched from being serious films to complete jokes. I was expecting ""The Avengers"" to be a really bad film. However, instead of being painful to watch like Iron Man 2, Captain America, and Thor, ""The Avengers"" is really entertaining as a whole.It is certainly an interesting film. It is sort of like the movie Machete, except much better. It has a B-movie feel to it, but is extremely entertaining. The villain is so cliché, it is hysterical. Part of what really makes this movie shine is the horrible acting and dialogue by several of the actors and actresses. The three worst actors in the movie are Loki (the villain played by Tom Hiddleston), Nick Fury (played by Samuel Jackson), and Agent Maria Hill (played by Colbie Smulders).While the idea of watching a movie with horrible dialogue may not be appealing to some, there is another side to the movie that works well in an admirable fashion. And that is the super heroes, particularly Iron Man, The Hulk, and Captain America. These actors really add some emotion and movie star pizazz to the movie in the same way that Liam Neeson did for The Phantom Menace (which is probably the worst movie of all time).The effects and action scenes are all top notch. Though some of the action scenes with the Black Cat and Hawkeye are a little unconvincing considering they are just normal humans with no super powers or technology.Nonetheless, it is fun to also see Robert Downey Jr. make fun of the campiness and unbelievable other Avengers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The spectacular crossover that started the Marvel universe franchise,"The great gathering of the heroes that started the Marvel Cinematographic Universe. Iron Man, Hulk, Captain America, Thor and Loki united in one single film. This movie has a very good premise that begins the franchise of the Marvel universe. With a great cast that perfectly interprets their characters, they bring to life these incredible characters that have long lived in comics or cartoons.

"It's a Bird, It's a Plane, It's an Iron Man, It's a Hulk....","Every fan geek's ultimate wet dream has been realized in this action movie that brings together all of the Marvel superheros that have appeared separately in their own films. It's not a big shocker that the film is loud, bombastic and only marginally coherent. It also happens to be exciting, funny and self aware enough to know just how seriously to treat the material. The result may not be one of the best action films ever made, but it's probably one of the better ones to be released in recent years.The boys in this movie -- Robert Downey, Jr., Chris Evans, Liam Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner -- are clearly meant to own the show, but it's Scarlett Johannsson who steals it.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Waste of Time,"This movie is just another one of Marvel's ploys to get money. After pushing out a mess of films forced to tie in with this once, you get a 2 hour, generic plot with characters who have generic back stories and abilities and are forced to work together and undoubtedly come together as one. It is NOT an original plot or even creative. I fail to see how long scenes of fighting, with the camera cutting back and forth is entertaining. If you actually truly LIKE this movie, please go see a doctor.I can't wait to see how the second film turns out. Marvel makes money purely being MARVEL, not because their films are outstanding and groundbreaking. They all have a generic plot and generic heroes.

Game changing (at least for about 10 years),"Even if the movie, the story, wasn't that great, this movie changed cinema (for better or worse), creating a path to serialized ""event"" movies, all ""important"" to have the whole picture of the insane 23 movies arc of the Avengers. Without this movie being this fun, well paced and put together, we wouldn't have the MCU.And it pretty much delivered on what it promised. Without the need to introduce the main characters, the movie ditched the typical structure and started with a bang to never slow down, really. With action from the start, connecting every single character already presented (the six heroes, their recruiter, the villain). The movie assumed we all knew the characters because we saw the other movies (making them literally a ""must watch"" to savior all the details and enhance the experience), which was the best decision ever. They didn't follow the rules (they created their own, which will be become stalled later) and made the best possible ensemble movie.But it wasn't just pure action, because with Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, they started (and would continue in the next movies) their philosophical (lightly philosophical, but still) exploration of war against an exterior threat. And they still managed to give the others moments to shine (if not really arcs of their own). Thor and Hulk with their powers; Black Widow's smart spy mind; Fury's uniting the team, etc.The action is insane and the CGI ridiculously perfect. Loki is perfect for a first villain and the dialogue is funny with the needed exposition done well.Having said all that, the second act could be better and parts a bit too childish or just stupid (Loki vs. Hulk; Hulk ""I'm always angry""; Hulk vs. Thor). But ultra minor things. Amazing movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

THE MUST SEE MARVEL MOVIE!,"No other movie has done a better job combining different main characters with different ongoing storylines. The Justice League got nowhere close (even the overrated but better than original Snyder Cut), not Jurassic World Dominion, not Star Wars (the sequels which are also very bad). The only piece of fiction that I would argue that did as good of a job combining characters is Game of Thrones. This movie also set the standard for invasions and cgi fights. I kept you invested and was pure fun to watch. When Hulk stops the giant alien worm and the 6 unit in a pan around shot complimented by the legendary music every audience member goes nuts and you are left with goosebumps. This same music is played during the Thor Wakanda entrance and portal scene from Endgame. Point being that this theme is used only for the most epic music. This is a top 20 scene in fiction and one that would shape history in film. Before this, comic superhero movies weren't all that popular. This is when, as a young kid, I became hooked and am still now with the MCU. Very disgusted to see how bad Phase 4 is turning out to be. Iron Man and Hulk carry this movie with Samuel Jackson's Nick Fury and Black Widow adding strong support. I will say this was a weaker movie for Thor and Captain American and his awful costume. Nick Fury and Black Widow do a great job of tying all the main characters together and introduce the audience to SHIELD. Every scene on the Helli carrier was worth watching. I loved how randomly Tony pointed out the Galaga player and the team's argument. Hulk is terrifying, which he should be, and we get see him on both sides. His fight with Thor was short but epic. Loki is an amazing villain to go up against everyone. Hiddleston gives a great performance with little. It makes sense why they didn't kill him off in this one. The death in the movie was sad but necessary to provide some stakes. The end invasion was kept simple enough to show off every character. And it ended in a unique way. Captain America vs Iron man is a great concept and started in this movie. They make for great allies and rivals. Black Widow, Bruce, Iron Man, and Captain America's opening scenes were all good. This is the only movie in which I have liked Ruffalo as Bruce. I will say he did great in this one. I don't care about the comedian in the other movies. End credit with Thanos set up everything and kept the audience wanting more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Don't believe the hype,"This film is entertaining. It is fun and has some amusing lines but at the end of the day is nothing more than the culmination of a marketing scheme started in 2008 with the Iron Man film. I didn't like that film then, felt like Spiderman with a different coat of paint and this one feels like X-men. Yes there's stunts and action but lets be honest Scarlett Johansen looks like she's working out what to buy with her fee throughout the entire thing, the 3-D effects were awful bar the flying arrow at the end and Samuel L Jackson is there to merely spout expositionary dialogue more at home in a Saturday morning kids cartoon.

Buffy with stubble,"This was far from a bad film but it also wasn't quite a great film. It has spectacular CGI, is funny and each of the characters are well developed (especially The Hulk). There's even a sad emotional moment at one point. Scar Jo is actually quite cool and Loki is a bad guy who you can both sympathise and despise at the same time. I can't actually say anything is particularly bad except maybe The Hawk, I've nothing against the actor but his skills with the arrow seemed a bit out of place with the others. He was like Legolas without the blonde wig. Speaking of blonde's, you could tell the film was done by Joss Whedon as the dialogue was interspersed with quick one liners and the banter between the team was funny (the best bit though was probably when no words were used at all between Hulk and Thor). It must have been difficult to mesh all the characters together and give each of the stars enough screen time to keep them happy. Overall, it's not as good as the Dark Knight but its not meant to be as dark and serious as that, the Dark Knight is a cartoon/comic book character pretending to be a proper film star, the Avengers has film stars pretending to be cartoon/comic book characters and it never takes itself too seriously so is fun to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What a load of Chitauri.,"Having already starred in their own standalone movies, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo, taking over the role from Edward Norton), Captain America (Chris Evans), and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) team up with Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) to form The Avengers, a team of superheroes-operating under the command of Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Samuel L. Jackson)-who are called upon to battle evil Asgardian Loki (Tom Hiddleston) when he threatens to invade the planet with his Chitauri army.The Avengers made an absolute mint at the box-office, proving to me that a large percentage of cinema-goers aren't all that fussed about an innovative or intelligible script just so long as they get plenty of bang for their buck. Written and directed by Joss Whedon, The Avengers Assemble (as it is known in the UK) is an unnecessarily convoluted superhero blockbuster wrapped around the most tired of premises: an evil being seeking a mystical energy source that will give him the power to rule the world. This trite set-up allows for countless effects filled battles during which no-one suffers anything more than a bruised ego.An impressive line-up of Hollywood A-listers and the most spectacular state-of-the-art CGI effects money can buy do not alter the fact that this is predictable, clichéd nonsense told with little style, coherence or originality.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""We have a Hulk""","This film has everything you want in a team up super hero film from grear action to great characters.The fight choreography was great not because of john wick level action sequences but just really fun and enjoyable action scemes that really embrace comic book fun.The villain loki is perfect as although he may have a generic motavation, the way clashes with the heroes ideologies and has huge amounts of personality made him unforgettable.One of my favourite things about this movie is the sense of urgency and dread, it really does feel like anything could happen and some thing could go wrong and this is due to some great writing and acting. Another thing i love is that the characters work so well with each oher and are handled so well, the best avengers (not in power but in character complexity) are all focused on more than the more boring characters which is awesome as it feels no potential was lost in the characters and it shows they actually put thought into there characters.Overall this movie still holds up as one of the best and most unforgettable mcu experiences but was still dissapionting in someAvengers was a huge moment for superhero films when it released back in 2012. A culmination of 4 years worth of individual superhero films featuring Iron Man (twice), Thor, Captain America and Hulk. I remember the hype surrounding it, there was no way this film could live up to fan expectations I thought...but I was wrong. In some ways it's a love letter to Marvel fans filled with easter eggs, humourous observations and more displays of super powers than you can shake a mjolnir at! But it's also simple yet effective in plot, a continuation of every individual Marvel film to date as of 2012 and it works. It's easy to follow but not only that, you can sort of start watching at any point and still be able to enjoy it. There are a number of great scenes and first time character interactions and I loved the strained dynamics. When the actual battle of New York starts the action ramps up further and it still contains some of the most fun moments of the entire MCU. Even though the world is at stake it never really feels like it because it's localised in New York but it's also not an emotionally heavy film, it's just a lot of fun for the majority from beginning to end. With so much going on at once though the action can get repetitive and therefore drag, creating occasional boring bits. The film does a great job of showcasing each heroes individual abilities by putting them in various situations in which they excell but it also does a great job of not making one hero appear drastically stronger than the rest. Captain America may not physically be able to compete with the bigger boys of the team, even with his super soldier enhancements, but he has excellent fighting skills, is a great strategist and has a shield that can't be broken which also happens to be a symbol of hope for many. Iron Man has arguably the largest arsenal of offensive weaponry but only when wearing his suit. The Hulk is arguably the strongest and most durable but also unpredictable and lacks intelligence. Thor is naturally the strongest of all and has the ability to control lightening through his magical hammer but he's also arrogant, ignorant and rash in his decision making, not to mention he can also be easy to trick. Hawkeye is a good fighter but not on the same level as Cap or Black Widow, he also doesn't have any physical advantages but he is deadly accurate with his bow and various arrows and can cause a lot of havoc from a distance. Black Widow has no physical enhancements either but her fighting skills are arguably the best in the team, even compared to Captain America, she's extremely proficient with hand guns and a brilliant actor enabling her to be the perfect undercover agent.I love this film as a lazy afternoon watch. It has humour, plenty of action, great special effects, a fitting score and easy to follow. It has some slow spots but it's the most ""fun"" feeling of all the Avengers films, it doesn't have this dark overtone the others contain. It's also an easy watch because you don't need to pay too much attention to everything. Highly reccomended!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Action Satisfaction,"Overall, this film delivers and this compliment comes from a Marvel fan. Though each individual hero remains true to character from their singular franchise, the film is nearly a live action cartoon. There is a humanism that live action brings to screen that animation lacks; It's called emotion, and Marvel's ""Avengers"" noticeably void of it.Regardless of that critique, no one goes for these types of films for ultra realism, but more so for the production value. Great action choreography, Johanssen is terribly hot in black leather, plenty of explosions and the Hulk does what he does best: ""SMASH"". The idea of some of my favorite hero's banding together, overcoming inter personal differences during a time of dire need and ultimately saving the day left me satisfied. This one is a must see and I recommend paying the extra to watch it in 3D. BTW, don't forget to hang around until the FULL EXTENT of the credits have passed. There are two additional scenes, one of which gives clues to a sequel and if you're a Marvel Fan, you'll be giddy as a school girl with a bag of lolly pops when you see it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"That's my secret, Captain... I am always angry","Marvel's first big event!!! The first 20 minutes of this movie are so good; the reintroduction of the characters was a really cool and creative choice. Marvel has become something that I really don't care about, but every time I rewatch this movie, I instantly get retransported into the golden days.The avenegrs follow a simple plot, unlike movies like etenals, where you need to have seen 20 movies to understand one character. The movie seamlessly integrates each story into a single, massive blockbuster. The Avengers was my most highly anticipated movie for phases 1 and 2.My only problem with this film was the screen time felt very split, so there wasn't really a main character. I mean, the film feels like a chefs kiss when it comes to comic book cinema. Each hero brings something unique to the table: Iron Man is the comedic relay character, and Thor is this godlike being. Hawkeye is a hero turned villain; Hulk smashes; however, Banner brings emotion to the table, Cap brings bravery and hope, and Black Widow brings style to the film. I think this film is very fairly rated; however, there are some reviews that I dont understand the ratings for. Seeing all the heroes fight together in NYC was just an utimant MCU moment.Loki is a great villain and is very threating. Tom is great as Loki, and he plays this chilidish character who seeks one thing...power. I will give Thor credit for giving a good entrance to Loki, and I think I like how this movie reintroduces him.Nick Fury is played by the amazing Samuel L. Jackson, and he is the thread that ties the Avengers together. In all of these Avenegrs films, there is a threat, the heroes are recreated, and the final hour is dedicated to a fight scene. I dont like how they just brush off the attack of NYC post-avengers; if this actually happened, it would be a good 40 years before the world decided to move on.The battle of NCY is by far the best scene in this movie, and I love the lizard designs as well. I am a nerd, so of course I am going to love this movie, just because of how simplistic it is. This might just be the only good movie Joss Whedon has directed. If your looking for an action-packed, fun watch, then The Avengers delivers.Overall: 8.6/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best Film Of 2012,"I am a huge fan of the previous Marvel films such as Thor, Captain America and my favourite of all Iron Man, but this film took it to a whole new level. There is nothing wrong about this film, the casting is perfect, the script is perfect, the film is just perfection. I went to see the film with my family and my mum isn't a huge fan of superhero film's but after watching this film she wanted to re-watch the other Marvel films as she loved this film so much, which goes to show the brilliant cast, director and writers have gone above and beyond to produce the perfect superhero films that even gets people who don't usual enjoy them into becoming a lover of the films. One of my favourite things about the film is the tension between the heroes at first and the bonds they end up having at the end of the film Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) develops a great bro-romance with The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). Hands down the best film I have seen in 2012, and best superhero film EVER, I'd love to see how they top this film as the expectations are running high. This film is lacking nothing, if you haven't seen it then you need to watch this film ASAP.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Epic finale makes it worth watching, but disappointing overall.","There are many movies that are hotly anticipated and there's a huge buzz on Twitter for months before they are released. Usually, I go to watch them with some trepidation—like in the case of 'Inception'—because I don't expect them to live up to the hype. That wasn't the case with 'The Avengers'. I went in fully expecting to love the movie. I didn't, for the most part.THE PLOTThere's perhaps no better way to describe my disappointment with it than to say that even though the whole movie revolved around an object called the Tasseract, by the time it was done, I had no idea what it was. It's surprising how a movie with so many characters and so little time for character and plot development still managed to squander the minutes.Any book or movie has a basic plot, which has only a handful of major variations, and you go in expecting to see a particular writer's take on that basic premise. You expect them to build on it and give it an elaborate new shape.In 'The Avengers', however, the basic plot is all you get—a team of heroes are initially uncooperative with each other, they fail against the villain, regroup and then beat him in a final showdown. What little attempts 'The Avengers' makes to dress that plot are so utterly reliant on other movies that have come before that to someone who hasn't seen them, it makes no sense whatsoever.'The Avengers' assumes that you have watched the Iron Man movies, 'Thor', 'Captain America' and 'The Incredible Hulk' before you set foot in the theater and does not feel the need to explain so many of the incomprehensible things that happen on the screen. A lot of people disagree with me on this point but I think it is nonsensical to expect me to watch five movies before I sit down to watch one. It's the responsibility of the scriptwriter to make sure that the movie stands on its own.THE HEROESMark Ruffalo in the role of Bruce Banner was fantastic in this movie and I think the funniest character overall. Tony Stark had the best punchlines but Banner's humor was more nuanced, in my opinion. But he did not get nearly as much screen time as he deserved. I'd like to see that guy get a Hulk movie of his own.Captain America, on the other hand, who was damn near useless in a war that involved hordes of flying drones, was a constant presence in the movie. The utter Americanness of Captain America makes me very indifferent towards the character and I thought the movie would've been better without him.Same goes for the Black Widow, who had little to do during the final battle. Hawkeye's storyline in the movie made no sense either, and Samuel Jackson just did not work as Nick Fury. He wasn't aggressive enough for the part.My favorite character is Iron Man, but he was a shadow of what he was in his own movies. He's supposed to be the funniest of the bunch but I could not really appreciate the punchline-heavy dialog he spouted. I think he's more genuinely funny in the Iron Man movies and, in fact, I'd love to see Jov Favreau direct 'The Avengers 2'. Still, after the Hulk, Iron Man was pretty much the only Avenger who had a significant role to play in the proceedings.THE VILLAINAs for the villain, Loki, the less said the better. He was an embarrassingly underpowered villain and didn't seem imposing for a second. Take away the drones, which themselves weren't very threatening, and he's almost impotent. He got blasted with a gun-like thing from a man in a suit, for crying out loud. Watching the final battle, it was clear that Iron Man could have taken on him alone—six superheroes was beyond overkill to counter this guy.MISCELLANEOUS COMPLAINTSI also took issue with the fact that ordinary humans had no role to play in this movie. There are only two scenes in which they even have a speaking part and they're both used for comic effect (and one of them is also used to try to justify Captain America's presence in this movie) and are inconsequential. It makes you feel detached from the movie; the action might be happening on Mars, for all anyone cares.The people who liked the movie, which is nearly everyone who saw it, are saying that the action was awesome and that's all anyone really wanted from this movie. Maybe you did, but that doesn't work for me. While the action at the end is of an epic scale that is rarely matched even in Hollywood, the dialog and plot are far more essential for me.THE ACTIONI'll say this about the action though: it was involving. In plenty of movies, epic battle scenes are filmed in such a way that you feel like you are watching the action from the outside. It's a jumbled mess of explosions and flying debris. In 'The Avengers', despite its six heroes and an army of flying drones, you could see the individual participants and feel like you were in the middle of the action. It was very satisfying, particularly in 3D.CONCLUSIONWhen you watch truly horrible movies, you exit the theater hoping that they never make a sequel (or at least resolving that you won't watch it if it were to be made), but that's not the case here. The potential for a great movie is clearly there, and I am glad that there will be a sequel to this movie—I just hope someone does a better job of making it. A story is about more than just its climax.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nice onset where Avengers assemble!,"Tone, Script & Story: Loki gets control of Tisseract. He wants to bring Doom of humanity by opening a portal to chitauri army with the help of Tisseract.

Avengers Who?,"The Avengers was a fantastic movie bringing all the Marvel movies together seamlessly. This is what I may have said if I'd ever seen or read anything Marvel in my life. Now, I realize this isn't the movie or producers fault, I'm just speaking for myself who happens to be utterly ignorant and oblivious to the world of comics in general. To start out the movie, I was happily surprised to think I was following the movie without any background knowledge. Suddenly I came to the realization that I was mistaken, being thrown into some sort of futuristic space ship setting. I was continuously introduced to new characters that didn't have character development as I was expected to be read up on that information before hand. The importance of the characters and their role in the movie tended to be a roller coaster ride. At the beginning, Scarlett Johansson grabbed my attention and stole the movie with everything she had to offer to the action side of the movie. She even took on 3 men without a blink. Somewhere along the line she ends up standing in the shadows without much to offer until the ending scenes. Chris Hemsworth's role in the film seems lost to me as well. The back and forth between helping Loci and wanting to take him down seems almost as if he's lost on which side to take. This was distracting to me. As a whole, the characters were interesting, however didn't exactly connect the story well. By the middle of the movie it dawned on me that it was becoming more and more predictable. From what I've gathered, no super hero movie has ended in the super hero's loss. Loci shows no sign of changing his ways from ""evil"" thus, the outcome become inevitable no matter what Loci throws the Avengers way. From that point on, every conversation of confusion between the characters and talk of what the next step will be to take seems pointless. The wondering and guessing games could have been done without as far as I'm concerned. The ending of the movie seemed to be too far fetched and far too drawn out to be enjoyable. Plausibly, they all should've died before the Hulk came around. The way the creatures were destroying buildings, it was hard to accept the fact that, even with super powers, they were destroying them one by one. The setting of this battle was also a little out of reach. Showing everyone walk away unharmed and guarded by the NYPD is beyond realistic given what the other creatures were capable of. None of the pedestrians seemed to even be worried about the danger in the aftermath, only thankfulness and gratitude for those who saved them. Is that how it would really happen? I surely wouldn't think so. As for the meaning and the plot line revolving around the Tesseract, I couldn't even being to explain that to someone. The power it holds and the large question ""why"" it holds the power it holds still confuses me. The knowledge needed for this movie before going into it seems to outweigh watching the film out of pleasure. While I understood the concept of the movie and could still gather main points, I believe that it reached out to more of the large Marvel fans that have been following for years, or decades. This movie was slightly disappointing, but what do I know, I'm still asking the question, Avenger who?",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Over the top but action-packed,"The previous 'origins' movies were significantly better than this blockbuster. The characters are reduced to one-dimensional caricatures and I am fairly certain some of Iron Man's dialogue is recycled from his own series of films. The script is poorly thought out (why is Jane Foster not recruited for her portal expertise? how come Thanos chooses to send Loki to Earth and why does Loki even want to rule Earth? why does Loki ever let his magical staff go? why are the alien soldiers incredibly weak compared to the hype? how did the astrophysicist somehow resist Loki's mind control but Hawkeye couldn't?), the jokes are groaners (""I am a god!"" *Hulk smashes said God* ""Puny God!""), and the premise is cheesy (ragtag group of superheroes must put aside their egos to work together as a team). That being said, the action sequences are enjoyable enough to sit through to the end of this long, 2.5 hour flick.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Marvel United (part 1),"The youngest of Marvel heroes ""Iron Man"", first appearance in comic format 1968, leads the way into a science fiction spectacle of superlatives.

Very fun and entertaining.,"The Avengers, directed by Joss Whedon, is a superhero blockbuster that brought together some of the most popular Marvel characters, including Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and the Hulk, to save the world from an alien invasion. The movie was a box-office success, grossing over $1.5 billion worldwide, and was widely acclaimed for its impressive visuals, thrilling action scenes, and witty humor.The plot of the movie revolves around the Tesseract, an energy source that is coveted by Thor's evil brother, Loki, who is determined to use it to conquer Earth. To stop him, Nick Fury, the director of S. H. I. E. L. D, assembles a team of superheroes, each with their own unique powers and personalities, to form the Avengers. The movie is packed with action, drama, and humor, as the Avengers must overcome their differences and work together to save the world from total destruction.One of the strengths of The Avengers is its talented ensemble cast, who brought their characters to life with impressive performances. Robert Downey Jr. As Iron Man is a standout, delivering hilarious one-liners and perfectly capturing the arrogance and charm of Tony Stark. Chris Evans as Captain America and Chris Hemsworth as Thor also shine, bringing gravitas and humanity to their roles. Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk is a surprising highlight, delivering a nuanced and emotional performance as the scientist struggling to control his monstrous alter-ego.The cinematography and visual effects in The Avengers are also top-notch, with stunning set-pieces and thrilling action sequences that are a feast for the eyes. The climactic battle in New York City, where the Avengers face off against the invading alien army, is particularly impressive, with Whedon expertly balancing the various characters and their powers.However, the movie is not without its flaws. Some critics have criticized the plot for being formulaic and predictable, and the character development is somewhat lacking, with most of the Avengers already having been introduced in previous movies. Additionally, the female characters, such as Black Widow and Maria Hill, are somewhat sidelined and do not have as much agency as their male counterparts.Despite these criticisms, The Avengers remains a highly entertaining and enjoyable movie that successfully combines humor, action, and drama. Its witty humor, impressive visuals, and talented cast make it a must-see for any Marvel fan, and its success paved the way for the even more ambitious Avengers movies that followed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

2012 Action Movie Blockbuster,"Amazing, revolutionary and exuberantly humorous are just 3 statements that describe this action packed but surprisingly complex plotted blockbuster movie. This film brings together the characters from the marvel comic book series ""the Avengers"" and gives you the action and effects of a big time movie but still gives you a comic book feel. When this movie came out I was swamped with work and did not have enough time for a movie. I worked hard and finally got a small window on a Friday night to see a single film. Luckily for me my friends were planning a fun night that included seeing ""the Avengers."" When they invited me I felt extremely lucky that this coincidently corresponded with my free time. When we got there I knew it was going to be a fantastic movie. Even though ""the Avengers"" had been out for weeks the movie theater was packed. Me and my friends got front row seats and experienced the full gripping action this movie had to offer.This is definitely a movie to see with friends because of the humor. As people would expect (if they have seen the previous movies) Tony Stark a.k.a. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) tells the most jokes. Many of these jokes are based off of rivalries such as the one that develops between Captain America and Tony Stark during the course of the movie. Captain America feels order is needed in the Avengers and that there should be a more established chain of commands. This conflicts directly with Tony Stark's spontaneous and freedom loving attitude. The clash results in humorous jiving comments from both heroes. There was also overall humor between all the character s making the movie wonderfully diverse.Like all super hero movies there was an abundance of action. The difference that made this movie stand out however is the twisting storyline. In the beginning, you discover that Thor's brother, Loki, has received an ancient power from an alien race that is after the Tesseract, a cube of unlimited power that is in the United States possession. The strange otherworldly powers these creatures have and their forms give Marvel studios a chance to put their graphic arts to the test. Also producers had to use imagination and skill to fashion the battle scenes throughout the movie. Marvel made these scenes so that they feel like you are reading a moving comic book. The action scenes throughout the movie never disappoint.While the action and humor of this film are good many people have complained that the beginning drags on a bit. Many super hero movies get right to the action while this one links all the Avengers stories. Before you see this movie I suggest to see the other origin Avenger hero movies. This will make the beginning more interesting.Lastly, the deep plot is like the icing on top of the cake. This movie brings the attitudes of all the characters together and shows how they fit together. The main part of the story is about the characters finding out how they work together. You can even sympathize for the villain, Loki, who is always in his brothers shadow.In the end, this is the best action movie I have ever seen. Even the second, third and fourth time I watched ""the Avengers"" I found some joke, underlying plot or important turning point that I hadn't seen. This multi-layered plot is the foundation of great movies. On the other hand many action movies have amazing structures or great affects and battles. It is very rare that you find one with both foundation and and a structure together in one move but one without the other is useless. ""The Avengers"" is a sturdy building that will survive a long time in the neighborhood of movies.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Disposable entertainment that does its job,"When a 13 year old boy is supposed to be the world's most frequent cinema attendant, it makes sense that Hollywood's summer blockbusters cater for immature audiences.For an assembled cast to work, each has to have a moment in the spotlight, and after being subjected to an hour of banter that maybe a 13 year old would find ""witty"", The Avengers fight one another because Loki's not a bad-arse enough villain to last a 2 hour film, before they finally turn on him and his army of space aliens.Were I 13 again, perhaps I'd think that this film did belong in the IMDb top 250... but then again, perhaps not. I'd like to think not.Don't get me wrong: for something to watch with a couple of mates if you'd rather stay in for the evening, The Avengers does what it set out to achieve: entertain (and make money); but it's the epitome of what has been dubbed the ""popcorn flick"", and once you've had your fill, into the bin it goes.But then, nobody ever expected a film about comic-based super heroes to be The Godfather.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The Avengers,"I guess The Avengers was the movie many Marvel comics fans were expecting. Finally, after a series of solo movies, a group of the fan favourite heroes were united under the Avengers tag: Ironman, Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow and that guy with a bow.The would be hero team bickers a bit in the beginning, as they are reluctantly put together to fight Loki, Thor's brother, who is again trying to take on the world. This time with a help of cube thingie called Tesseract, that opens a portal through which a some sort of biomechanoid warrior race runs through to do the actual conquering.In order to get the full impact of the movie it would probably be the best to know a lot about the Marvel universe, either from the comics or from the movies, as the Avengers doesn't even pretend to be a movie friendly for new viewers. It's not muddled piece of fan service, but it is filled with things, that are left relatively obscure without prior knowledge of what has happened in the Marvel universe. The Avengers is fully watchable, even if you don't know that much about Marvel's world, but it does feel a bit hollow experience none the less. It just can't escape from its roots, which have been made during many other movies.As said, The Avengers is not a bad movie. It's filled with great actors from Samuel L. Jackson to Robert Downy JR, almost all of which are familiar from the previous Marvel movies. Thay all do serviceable roles. They make the movie work, but none of them gets huge amounts of time as people, as the movie expects the viewers to be already familiar with them, be it Tony Starks arrogance or Bruce Banners life in shambles caused by his alter ego.All in all, while the Avengeres is not a perfect movie, it is a nice start for a probably a lot more of them.

Without these awesome characters this film would be nothing. They honestly shape this film and their banter and chemistry with one another is awesome! There are a lot of humorous as well as heartfelt moments which all lend to an awesome film! 2. The villain; Loki in my opinion is the best villain of the MCU. He has motivation you understand and his rivalry with Thor is mesmerizing! Tom Hiddleston once again does a fantastic job as this character and he was the perfect villain for this movie. 3. The action; all of the action is done well! There is quite a lot of CGI, but it doesn't get in the way of the film, and because of these awesome characters all the action and explosions have weight to them.

However, I felt the first half of 'The Avengers' as slow. What also didn't help is that the villain, carried over from a preceding MCU film, isn't super interesting - we also don't see the antagonist's earlier film counterpart for a fair few scenes, which felt too delayed.The last half is much better, which allowed me to enjoy myself properly. Robert Downey Jr., while not as entertaining as he is on his own, brings goodness, as do the likes of Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth.I'm not a big fan of recasts, though Mark Ruffalo as Hulk is a positive one; even if that took a bit away from the novelty of all the superheroes joining, given we hadn't seen Ruffalo himself before. Added to Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, at least in terms of the film franchise, getting major screen time out of nowhere - having been a bit part character in her debut MCU appearance.The music is noteworthy, while everything looks brilliant.

An Ensemble Act That Falls Short of the Hype,"Among 2012 summer blockbusters, no other titles have garnered as much attention and praise as Avengers. Directed by Joss Whedon, this superhero ensemble film marked a groundbreaking moment in the MCU, bringing together iconic characters for a spectacle of action and mayhem. While undeniably entertaining, it's hard to ignore the lingering feeling that the film's reputation might have overstated its impact.The premise is simple yet enticing: Earth's mightiest heroes-Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye-join forces to thwart an alien invasion orchestrated by Loki. The film's success, however, leans heavily on its presentation of the heroes' collective camaraderie and, of course, the action-packed set pieces.From a technical standpoint, Avengers hits all the right notes. The special effects and choreographed battles are a visual spectacle, catering to fans of explosive action and superhuman feats. Joss Whedon's direction seamlessly juggles the ensemble cast, allowing each hero to showcase their signature powers and personality quirks. Yet, this triumph often overshadows a more pressing question: Is there more substance beneath the surface?The film's narrative ambition doesn't quite match its technical prowess. Avengers leans heavily on its tried-and-true formula, where heroes initially clash due to differing viewpoints, only to unite against a common threat. This formulaic structure, while a staple of superhero storytelling, fails to provide the depth and nuance that could elevate the film beyond mere popcorn entertainment.One of the key criticisms directed at Avengers is its lack of profound themes or underlying messages. Unlike some of its MCU counterparts, which delve into complex moral dilemmas and societal reflections, Avengers predominantly rests on the laurels of spectacle and the thrill of seeing beloved characters share the screen. The film's humor, while often enjoyable, occasionally undercuts moments that could have carried more weight.Character development, too, takes a backseat to the film's action-oriented focus. While each hero brings their own charisma to the table, their arcs largely remain within the confines of their established personas. Moments of introspection or growth tend to be fleeting, leaving audiences hungry for more substantial evolution.In conclusion, Avengers is by no means a bad movie. Its status as a cornerstone of the MCU is well-deserved, considering its pioneering feat of assembling beloved characters on such a grand scale. However, the film's reputation as a game-changer might overshadow its shortcomings. It's an entertaining watch that delivers on its promise of action and hero camaraderie, but its lack of deeper thematic exploration and character depth prevents it from ascending to the echelons of true cinematic greatness.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

She is very sexy and played her role of Maria Hill very and very sexy) I'd very much like to have such a girlfriend in me life))So) The task was to make many episodes like video clips)) where each of the characters have single and impressive dialogue and acting. Then - to unite them all into a movie. Personally, after watching it three times.. I'm a big fan of Scarlett so first time I was all into her.. Second time I watched it I liked the performance of Tom Hiddleston, well.. this is a movie where all actors are just perfect))Tom .. there is something ideal for him to take the role of Loki.. you will never see him as a villain)) You will understand him and have compassion - this is what Marvel is all about))But today.. as I watched it the third time.. it was all about the connection. about understanding, about to be together. Strange but this third time, I noticed the trust Captain America tried to have to this team, strange and unknown to him.. Sacrifice Iron Man made.. their mutual partnership.. you know.. Marvel's movies are not about fun comics blockbuster they have a meaning) This movie was about understanding and to be together despite all odds) A dialogue between so different people and about not to be alone but to be together)) This is why I love Marvel movies so much) They have this humanity in it)) Beauty of humanity in all of the rage of a blockbuster))So today.. it is about Thor still loving his half brother, Widow saving Arrow, Iron man and Captain working together.. Hulk.. trying so much to be a good man he always is..

I'm going to start by telling you I should have liked this. I like a good leave brain-at-the-door, popcorn stuffing uber romp as much as the next person. Having grown up reading Marvel comics I have a bit of a soft spot for The Avengers. I should have liked this... a lot. But... but... but.....For the uninitiated here's the plot: one-eyed Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. (don't ask it gets sillier) assembles a team of disparate superheroes to save the planet from the pan-dimensional pantomime baddie Loki and his army of marauding alien invaders. Yes! Together at last! Mister Blonde, Mister Angry, Mister Smug, Mister Boring, Mister Forgettable and Little Miss Lycra gang up to punch CGI aliens repeatedly in the face whilst Tom Hiddlestone does his best Shere Khan impersonation. Flying battleships? Collapsing buildings? Alien invasion? Rock 'em sock 'em punch ups? Snappy dialogue? Scarlett Johansson in Lycra? Sounds good doesn't it? Well....Robert Downey Junior does his smart-talking smug thing again. Chris Hemsworth does his blonde bombshell anachronistic demi-God thing again. That dull bloke is that dull Captain America again. The Hulk bounces around in unconvincing CGI destructo mode again. Scarlett Johansson does her pouty, spandexy ass kicking thing again. Again and again and again. You get my point. It's all more of the same. Except multiplied. A running, jumping, punching, flying, exploding, CGI extravaganza. All sound and (Nick) fury but signifying nothing other than an, admittedly, smart director helming some famous faces in front of green screen while a legion of CGI artists beaver away at the rendering. Is this movie making or games design? There are plus points. There is at least an attempt at some character development. Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner has a good line of banter with Tony Stark/ Iron Man. There are some decent gags. Tom Hiddleston is enjoying himself being archly camp as the baddie. But, it's just not enough. As once again the whole thing collapses under the weight of more CGI aliens. Let's be honest I went in with the biggest bag of pop-corn. Brain checked in at the door. Expecting to be entertained. I guess I was but to be honest I don't really remember much as I my primary register was... deep breath... boredom.Now before I get kicked to death by hordes of Marvel fan-people (look how PC am I?) None of this is the fault of the film. The 13 year old me (whilst being grumpy with the portrayal of Hawkeye) would probably have thought all his Christmases had come at once. Yet, Avengers Assemble has left me teetering on the edge of an existential crisis: I'm just too old for this s**t.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A lot of deluded fans out there...,"While this is a perfectly decent movie, it certainly is not the 10 out of 10 some people seem to think it is worthy of, a victim of the over hyped build up by the studio maybe. To be frank, I found all the Avengers themselves lived up to expectations, but the overall storyline and plot was not worthy of the super heroes so many have come to love and adore. The truth is that with so many central characters their opportunity to shine is limited, no matter how well they play their roles. The Dark Knight is, in my opinion, the pinnacle of the super hero genre(so far) and the Avengers doesn't come close. Sorry guys I know I will have offended a few Marvel Maniacs with that comment but it really is true if you look deep enough within yourselves, The Dark Knight is one of the best films of all time, the Avangers is not, plain and simple. Worth watching but not worth the wait. Iron Man/Captain America are at least equally as good in their own right.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Seven years later, this is still one of the best films in my collection","This is one of the best films I've ever seen, not just because it's a fun action film, filled with characters that I've grown to love, but because it was the first of its kind, setting the bar for other multiple-character franchises. It's a first, and because of this it absolutely has its flaws, but it's definitely a game changer.Despite having seven lead characters (counting all Avengers plus Loki), everyone got at least a few moments of screen time devoted to their development. With seven leads, that's pretty amazing. We have the quiet moments, the little gestures and phrases that have been picked apart time and again by the fans that have granted a depth to the film that wouldn't have been possible if this were the first time we met any of these characters, and that's the real beauty of Avengers. It's a team-up flick, but it's a team-up of characters we've all been introduced to before. (Even if you hadn't seen any of the previous films, there was a sort of pop culture awareness around most of them by the time it was released that you'd be hard pressed to go in blind about anyone except the characters who didn't have their own film yet and were, however regrettably, less important because of it.)Combine that with a well-loved director who isn't afraid to sucker punch his audience, and you've got a perfect mix for a film that doesn't just thrill audiences with fight scenes that are larger-than-life, but gets people to invest emotionally in a fictional world. Avengers was released more than two years ago, but the film is still being picked apart and very much alive in the hearts and minds of the fans because of Marvel's expert world-building. In every show, every film, you see threads that lead back (or forward) to other events in the Universe, and it's this sort of continuity that the fans love. They pick up on every little reference, read into every word of dialogue, every prop placement, every choice that the creative team makes, and this is what has made Avengers so successful. It stands up to that test, and even with ten films under Marvel's belt, there's still very few inconsistencies. (Especially when you compare it to the next largest Marvel franchise, X-Men, which has some major timeline problems around Wolverine.)All in all, this is a film that should be in every collection because it's not just great, it's revolutionary.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent Team Up Movie,"This movies is overall an absolute blast from the dynamic fight scene that make use of different characters powers to banter and tension that exists between the characters. The teams chemistry as they worked together is an excellent pairing to go against the main antagonist.Honestly this movie does a very good job of balancing cross overs cohesively while not losing track of the plot.The only ""flaw"" of this movie is how generic it can seem at moments, specifically other enemies besides Loki, while fun to fight aren't really interesting considering the are what makes up the climax of the movie.Overall a near perfect Superhero movie that executes exactly what it says it is.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nearly Perfect Superhero Movie,"How is that this movie is so good even after masterpieces of phase three? I re-watched it two times in a row (which makes it a total of 6) and still loved every moment of it. If I have to guess it's the amazing chemistry between the actors and a great writing (unlike awful Game of Thrones,season 8), which makes it tick. There are no grade A actors in it , aside perhaps Robert Downy Jr. and Sam L Jackson, yet in this one, every one is a star. Both Evans and Hemsworth embrace their role to perfection and aren't just a pretty face. They are captain America and Thor respectively, and I cant' imagine anyone else in that role. A typical acting of Mark Ruffalo, actually works perfectly and one might say that he did his difficult role of Hulk even better than Ed Norton, whom I personally consider to be one of the best, though notoriously known difficult to work with, actors. Scarlet Johanson Gave a superb performance and for me this is one of her best movies ever. Not to forget everyone else, who gave an outstanding performance. This movie is not without its flaws, yet the sheer enjoyment and inspiration it provides, makes up for it. I will give it a 10/10 rating, as this is a movie that started an Avengers craze for me, so all the other movies, even the bad ones, fall into their place in this epic movie series.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Will never be lower than a 10!,"The culmination of the first 5 movies. Here we have all the heroes we've seen so far come together for an epic battle against a returning and likable villain. If you're watching the MCU for the first time then this is truly the most epic story and will be the most epic in the MCU for a while. It's incredibly attracting mainly because of the character interactions with the theme of teamwork. The acting is incredible and everyone does their part at keeping the movie going with the team's chemistry. The dialogue is awesome keeping the movie in a lighter tone until the movie starts to pick up. So the movie is never boring. The cinematography is amazing and has the 2012 feel to it without being to cheesy. The pacing of the movie is great and no scene is longer or shorter than it should be. The effects still hold up. The sound is good and the music and score is insanely awesome! While not being a fan of Joss Whedon, I'll still give him my applause for making a perfect crossover.

I'm Thunderstruck by this Film's Immense Popularity,"""The Avengers"" is an okay superhero movie; that's it. A great deal of the problem is that there are too many characters at once. The viewer doesn't get any time to understand most of the characters' backstories or motivations. They are suddenly called up for duty to defend the earth against the scrawny and mysterious alien supervillain based off of a Norse god. Most of the superheroes were not interesting, as their personalities were not that well-developed. The exception to this is Iron Man, who is wonderfully played by Robert Downey, Jr. Iron Man is depicted as a wealthy sarcastic playboy who isn't necessarily a hero for altruistic reasons. The smarminess and smugness of Iron Man's character may turn a lot of people off; but hey, at least it's a ""character"". There are a few scenes where the Hulk is really funny, but that is only as the Hulk persona, rather than as Bruce Banner. The rest of the superheroes are bland and undeveloped as characters. The film is also confused as to its tone. It tries to take its superhero world seriously, like the Tim Burton's ""Batman"" but also adds in tongue-in-cheek humor and makes attempts to be self-referential and campy, like the Joel Schumaker ""Batmans"". The balance is uneven at best.The film's characters, with the exception of the Incredible Hulk, do not have enough fame or notoriety, like that of Superman, Batman or Spiderman, to be familiar to a general audience. This film is catered to an audience intimately familiar with the Marvel Comics universe and all of its characters, which will leave an uninitiated viewer utterly clueless about who's who. Who the heck is Black Widow? Nick Fury? Why do Thor and Loki speak in a bizarre, overly-proper form of English? Is it because they're aliens? Why should we care?It is merely a personal matter of taste, but CGI has not evolved to the point where the special effects look entirely real; the closest computer animation has gotten to being realistic is James Cameron's ""Avatar"", where the aliens have genuinely human expressions and movements. The CGI in ""The Avengers"" is ugly to look at, particularly the ship the Avengers use as a home base, as well as the alien invaders towards the end. It is not worth it to pay extra for 3-D glasses to watch grey, ugly aliens riding grey, ugly spiny snakes while emerging from grey, ugly, bland modernistic monstrosities that pass for alien spaceships. The ultimate irony is the cheap gorilla and diving suit from ""Robot Monster"" (haven't seen the movies, just stills) looks more creative and inspired than the effects in this movie. The point is that there is little color and beauty in the CGI, and it always looks more fake and lifeless than rubber puppets or furry Ewok costumes ever could. I would go so far to say that the greyness and blandness of the alien and Avengers' flying fortress design totally detracted from the power of the action sequences. Notwithstanding the distracting CGI, the action scenes, as stand- alone pieces, are engaging and entertaining to watch.In short, ""The Avengers"" lacks interesting characters and, while not entirely the fault of the filmmakers (technology still has a long way to go in 2012 before anything approaching realism can be fully realized, so my criticism in unfair in that respect), the CGI wasn't pleasant to look at. Watch ""The Avengers"" for the action scenes and for Hulk and Iron Man, who are funny and interesting. It's a fair effort, but nothing that approaches a timeless action classic. At least the Christopher Reeve ""Superman"" movies were infused with tongue-in-cheek humor and had an undeniable camp value; ""The Avengers"" takes itself too seriously to become a nostalgic classic like ""Superman"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Masterpiece / The Avengers,"The Avengers is one of these rare movies where it lives up to all the tons of hype it has gotten! It has made over 1.5 billion dollars, and it has received high praise from both fans and critics. And the success of this movie is very well deserved! The really great thing about this movie doesn't come from all the action, humor or visual effects... It is to see all these characters interact with each other in one room! Joss Whedon truly was the man for the job, and he impresses once again with his ability to portray each character as meaningful as the other. Everybody counts! There isn't one hero, but six of them! And they are all relevant and meaningful, plus all their character development is superb... All of them! Whedon has my full respect!The visual effects in this movie are out of this world! It really is spectacular and a joy to watch! The cinematography is likewise beautiful in this movie! But in the technical department all my praise and full respect goes to Alan Silvestri! His score for this movie blew me away! Especially, the ""Avengers Assemble"" tune! No gripes from me in the technical department!As for the cast they are all terrific! Robert Downey Jr. is easily my favorite and probably the funniest in this movie! Mark Ruffalo makes the best Bruce Banner aka ""The Hulk"" to date, with a serious and human, yet comedic performance! Chris Evans is still quite good as Captain America. As far as performances go, this guy is probably the weakest. But he's still an awesome actor! Chris Hemsworth isn't a remarkable actor either, but he has nice charisma and fits the role as Thor! Scarlett Johansson is smoking hot and sexy, and much more relevant than she was in Iron Man 2! Jeremy Renner was Agent Clint Barton aka Hawkeye! Samuel L. Jackson was epic in the role of Nick Fury! Tom Hiddleston is really strong and serious villain!. Stellan Skarsgård and Cobie Smulders is also good in their supporting roles!I've chosen to judge this movie with what it is: a fantastic superhero-movie!

I was fooled by the rating,"The movie was shouting so loud to catch attention and it certainly did. Too bad it was so disappointing and shallow afterwards... 3D did not entertain or maybe dragged the whole movie down even more than the sad plot.From the beginning it was clear to me that the movie won't jump high enough and come up to my expectations, all I had to do was watch the trailer and it told me how the whole movie will be - explosions, dorky costumes, pointless dialogs and lame jokes that recently have flooded Hollywood.Surely when the Avengers came out and I saw the rating (8.8 ?!), I assumed that I was wrong. Such great score! I just had to see this magnificent, most brilliant movie ever.Time in the theater passed and my little sparkle died rather quickly. Not only did some parts could have been cut out to shorten the torture, but they could have added a little bit of originality too. No matter how I look at it, some scenes and ideas resemble Transformers 3.This was not brilliant at all.

"Great fun, but let's not exaggerate","I have been a comic fan since the mid 90's. After a gap of almost 15 years a recently picked up my old hobby. Much has changed since I last read Spider-man, Wolverine and The Punisher. I never have been a fan of Fantastic Four or The Avengers. And after this movie, I won't change my mind about it.Not that The Avengers is a bad film, it's really not. But it's not all that the hype pretends it is. Whedon makes a very enjoyable popcorn-movie that's true to it's comic book roots. You get a lot of bang for your buck: 6 superheroes in a 2+ hour movie. Whedon keeps all his movies light and with humor. I finally see what he intended with Alien Resurrection. Although I still think it would not have worked. Alien doesn't lend itself for humor. But this material does. And Whedon does it well. The story isn't too complicated. I'm glad all these movies use elements from the golden or silver age of the original comics. The story is a old-school kinda story. Not complicated and with little back story (because all of them had an individual one. Some even two!).The effects are well done, although I think on a TV screen (even by today's standards), it's just too chaotic to really follow. I had the same feeling with the horrendous Transformer-films. Although the action in this film isn't half as confusing as those three turds.All and all: it's a nice blockbuster with steady performances, good action and an old fashioned, humorous story. I could write half a page about it being a little too patriotic and militaristic, but hey, I'm European. I really don't get all the fascination with guns and jets and stuff.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Wow,"The Avengers was awesome. It should not have been. There were so many characters that writing a coherent screenplay and doing each character justice should have been impossible. But nevertheless, Joss Whedon managed to write an awesome screenplay.
My only flaw, because let's get it out of the way, was that the first act was slightly slow. But it needed to be slow to give the characters motivations, and bring them together convincingly. I was also surprised at how funny the movie actually was.
All the character, be it Iron Man or Black Widow, we're given sufficient screen time. Nobody look out of their depth. Everyone was in the movie for a reason, and in the final battle, all the characters proved to be useful.
Also, this movie gave us the best version of the Hulk. Technically, the movie was flawless.
Marvel has always suffered with it's villains. I am happy to say that Loki is one of the best villains ever. He was manipulative, cunning and charming at the same time.
Before this movie, so many superheroes coming together seemed like a dream. Marvel was betting everything on this movie. And this movie succeeded. It has changed Hollywood forever. Whether it's a good thing or a bad thing is a debate for a different time. But this movie succeeded in everything it set out to accomplish.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Avengers Finally Assembled!,"I have seen ""The Avengers"" twice now. I really wanted to like the movie and after seeing it for the first time, I didn't quite like it, so I gave the movie a second chance to absorb myself more and found out that my first Judgement about the movie was quite right.The Avengers has some awesome special effects (just like every other movie these days Transformers, Battleship, Darkshadows etc). There are a few scenes in particular that I liked in the movie :- + Black Widow's introduction was quite amazing + The Fight scene in the S.H.I.E.L.D Carrier was intense and amazing + The Final Fight Scene is truly breathtaking and heartwarming too (psstt you know what the Iron Man does) Almost the rest of it was quite Formulic, bad guy tries to take over the world, brings the army, Avengers are assembled and huge intense action scenes.I really wanted the characters to interact with each other more and get to know about each others strength and weaknesses. I also would have loved an intense plot with maybe a twist to surprise us in some way. I am really hoping that they take the criticism of the movie made by the fans at heart and improve on everything what they did here.I still have high hopes for The Avengers in there next movie and I am really hoping that I would get to give it at least an 8 or a 9 the next time around.P.S I saw the deleted scenes of the movie, they all fitted quite well and added more to the story, don't know why they decided to take it out.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
nothing to spoil,"After reading many very positive reviews about this movie I thought I had to watch it. After watching, most surprising to me was that the movie didn't surprise a single moment! It wasn't interesting at all, fell asleep at least 3 times while watching it. In fact these moments of sleep/ half sleep are the moments I will remember best when thinking back of The Avengers. I like looking at movies a lot and can enjoy very different genres and qualities, but falling asleep while watching is something I usually don't or cannot do. So this movie -especially in its genre- must be a complete failure.What do I remember after a few days? A bad guy that really wasn't scary, some super heroes that had to fight together to stop that bad guy (and some more I guess), some images of them being on a space ship, and that's it! That's all!What about the end? I'm sure I was awake at that moment of time but I simply can't remember. It could have only been the heroes winning the battle but how and where? I think they saved the earth and have been trying hard to do so, but at least it happened without any unexpected or original idea. So for this movie, there is even no chance of writing a review that contains spoilers! What could possibly be there to spoil?

Why do I feel like Shawarma!?!?!?!?!. A must watch for comic book fans,"'The Avengers' was directed by Joss Whedon and stars Roberty Downey Jr, Chris Evans and Tom Hiddlesticks(Hiddleston if it actually bothers you). It's the end result of 5 previous movies, combined into one awesome spectacular entry to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. When a charming, likable British villain tries to attack Earth with his giant disposable CGI space army forcing some mentor like figure to form a super team, consisting of the protagonists from 5 completely separate movies rolled into one. And thus we have a Cinematic Universe. Thanks Feige. Your brilliance had doomed us all.The Avengers is one of the most likable, enjoyable, fun action/superhero movies that's ever been released and redefined a genre. Without this movie, all the cinematic universes we have today wouldn't exist(the debate on whether that's good or not is still open) and a superhero movie on this scale would have been attempted. Don't watch this movie expecting 'The Dark Knight' or 'X-Men' because this movie centres fun as its #1 goal and excels at it. All the cast is likable, the action is fun and it is overall just a great, big fun way to spend 2 hours of you life.As much as I praise this movie, it does have some flaws. The main flaw is the dull, generic and cliché ridden story which is just really poorly written. It follows the tropes way too closely and began the trend to have NO stakes in Marvel movies. I will also say the 'ending' should have had more of an impact and felt more important than it was so I would definitely say it should have been handled better. The end credits sequences are gold, though.Robert Downey Jr is excellent as Iron Man and is easily the best part of the MCU. On the flip side of this, I will say that I was very disappointed in Chris Evan's Captain America and I think his blatant lack of emotion and all times is unsettling and boring to watch. I understand the need of a straight man to keep the group in check but he was more like a robot than a human. Hiddlesticks was phenomenal as Loki and remains as easily the best MCU villain. He's smart, he's charming and, most importantly, he's British. That must be a requirement on entry to the 'Super villain Squad' because every villain in the universe is British(or at least the good ones are). Scarlett Johanson was good as Black Widow and you can see genuine emotion between her and Hawkeye. She may not be a critical member of the team but she's a female and yay for diversity. Mark Ruffallo was great as Bruce Banner and I adore how he refers to his alter ego as 'the other guy'. Jeremy Renner was fine as Hawkeye and remains the most useful Avenger with his SICK Archery Skills. Seriously though, he doesn't need to exist. Chris Hemsworth was good as Thor but not particularly memorable. Samuel Jackson is great as Nick Fury and a 15 rated movie of him would be comedy gold.The cinematography for this movie is great and I adore the tracking shots Whedon uses in the action and I think it benefits the action so much. Whedon CAN do action supremely well. The effects are amazing and are a delight to look at. The costume design was great and the set design was also really good.This movie needed to provide some fun action sequences, be funny and bring one of the most iconic superhero teams to the big screen without getting crucified by die hard Marvel fans. I can speak for two of them factors and say it achieved them. As for the third one, I can't comment but I will assume they were happy.In conclusion, this is undoubtedly one of the best comic book movies of all time and is just great fun to watch. If you haven't seen this movie, I highly recommend you do because it is pure, adrenaline filled enjoyment.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"What can be said that hasn't already?  This is a big, big movie that veers uncomfortably throughout froom awesome to average.","Right. It's too long for a start. Way too long. Partly because director Joss Whedon has chosen to write 6back stories before the actual story begins. But when it does the effects are so off the scale as to mesmerise.It's funny in parts. Ruffalo as The Hulk has all the comedy gasp out loud adventure moments but Thomas Downie Junior continues to build a body of light comedy work that's slowly making him ""best in class"". Scarlett Johansonn has an admirable ass but adds little other than that. Cobie Smulders is hot. And so is Gweyneth Paltrow.The CGI and SFX as the ""Aliens"" invade New York in the final reel are the best I have ever seen. By a long way. The destruction of Manhattan is actually quite scary reminding us, as it does, of 9/11.Cinematography by Seamus McGarvey, surely one of Edinburgh's great film exports (despite being an Ulsterman) is a career high of many highs.Without the back stories this would have been little short of perfection.

Nothing truly outstanding but among the better superhero movies,"I will try to analyze this movie from a different point of view than most of the critics do. I went to see this movie without any expectations because of many favourable critics but I haven't seen movies such as Captain America, Hulk, Iron Man, Thor and so on. Usually, superhero movies are not my cup of tea and I find them rather childish and only focused on special effects and the same old redundant stories.This movie is among the better superhero movies but it's definitely not the big thing many people claim it to be.On the positive side, we have the great 3D effects that are really worth watching this movie in the cinema in comparison to many movies in 3D that are not quite spectacular and only try to raise the gross. The graphics and special effects of this movie are flawless and of the highest modern standards thanks to an exaggeratedly high budget of course.But there are other positive things to find. Robert Downey Jr. does once again an incredible job and becomes a better actor in my estimation each time I see him in a new movie. He is some kind of a slightly crazy but charming dreamer with a sense for romance and cool humour and incarnates the Iron Man in a perfect way. Mark Ruffallo plays a rather calm and intellectual gentleman that becomes the Hulk as soon as he doesn't control his anger. His acting is also very authentic and grounded in this over the top movie. These two actors really impressed me the most but Tom Hiddlestone as the egoistic avenger and half god Loki and the great Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury are also quite convincing while the other actors can't catch up with these four talented actors.On the other side, the story kicks off way too fast and if you don't know much about the Marvel characters, you will feel a little bit lost in the beginning. It's not quite clear who is attacking whom and why in the first couple of minutes but after that, the pace of the movie slows down and introduces the different characters in a solid way. In the case of the Hulk or Natasha Romanov (as she seems to be of Russian origin, her actual name should be ""Romanova"" - it's a pity that such a famous movie with such a big budget has this kind of stupid error), the introduction's scenes are amusing and entertaining while the presentations of Captain America or the Iron Man are not very well thought out in my opinion.On the other side, the story of this movie is pretty generic and also predictable. The movie also has some important length in the middle of the film as the superheroes are discussing on the giant airship. The battle scenes in the end of the movie also get rather boring after a while and lack of diversity. The ending is also too much of a common standard to truly impress.In the end, there are almost as many negative as there are positive things to mention but as the quality of the positive facts is quite elevated and a more important factor than the pure quantity and as this movie was almost very well entertaining me over a quite long running time with two little exceptions, I may give a shyly positive seven points to this flick. After all, I might now try out the movies about Hulk and the Iron Man who are my favourite characters in this movie and can't deny that this movie awoke some interest in me to dig a little bit further into the Marvel world I have missed out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"AWESOME, ENTERTAINING, BAD-ASS, UNIQUE","I think the title says it all. I enjoyed every second of the movie! Worth watch and all other Marvel movies. I'm not a fan but when the movie is great, it's great!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Far too much going on to pay close attention,"You will be dazzled and ultimately somewhat exhausted by all the characters and story lines. I love each one of these heroes individually, but I have to admit it was all too much for me. And then, for sentiment, they add a gratuitous scene (which is real sad) when a minor character dies to give context to it all. It was dashed together, crammed together, and bashed up all together. I am glad I went to see it but I was a bit bewildered and my butt hurt. I was overwhelmed and underwhelmed. I think that is really all I have to say but this site wants me to write much more and I think I have said enough. I don't want to dissuade anyone from seeing it especially if you are a fan, but this is really how me and my friends felt. It made a billion dollars on its opening weekend so there is no slowing this movie down. I could have skipped it and felt all the better for it had I trusted someones opinion, but everyone is rushing around trying to laud this monster hit so my voice is not going to be heard in this din.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Incredibly incredibly good. Great action, lines and characters, this is where it all started!!!","Not having watched this film in a while I had forgotten how good it was, especially at its time. A superhero team formed and brought together in the right way (legendary superheroes too).Nearly everything about this film works, the action, the one liners, the characters and their various plots (Fury, Loki). It's just damn fun. And without any agendas pushed down our throat all the better for it!!!All the characters are great here, the evil Loki, grand Thor, proper Captain America, and even hawkeye, hulk and black widow are better than I remembered. But as always the incomparable Robert Downey junior owns every scene as iron Man.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Marvel-ous Masterpiece,"""There was an idea, called the Avengers Initiative. The idea was to bring together a group of of remarkable people to see if they could become something more. To see if they could work together when we needed them to, to fight the battles that we never could"". - Nick Fury. And producer Kevin Feige brought that idea to life 10 years ago. I remember being excited to watch the movie with my family and everything still holds up. The jokes, the fight scenes, the cast's chemistry and the incredible musical score from Alan Silvestri. It was all crafted beautifully thanks to Joss Whedon's amazing direction and killer script. Even Thanos' cameo still holds up until his scene-stealing performance in ""Infinity War"" and ""Endgame"". It still remains one of the greatest superhero movies of all time and one of the greatest movies ever made period. Just like ""The Dark Knight"" became an influential movie in the superhero genre, ""The Avengers"" is a influential movie on how to make crossovers and team-up stories the right way. Growing up in the 2000's, Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" trilogy, X-Men and The Dark Knight were the superhero movies that had a impact on my childhood but didn't create a lot of buzz because of ""Harry Potter"", ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and ""Twilight"". The 2010's became the gold standard for superhero movies as ""The Avengers"" and later ""Endgame"" broke box office records and the MCU became the new ""Star Wars"". Marvel continues to excite, thrill and bring something new that I can't wait for the next groundbreaking hit. Happy 10th Anniversary to Earth's mightiest heroes and its legacy will continue for years to come. Excelsior! - Stan Lee.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Start of something beautiful,"This movie is so rewatchable, even to this day. Watching all of the Avengers talk and interact with each other is so much fun. Loki was a very memorable and compelling villain. He posed a serious threat and he implemented some sort of urgency. The recasting of the Hulk wasn't annoying at all. The core of the relationship and argument between Tony and Steve has its foundation in this very film, and only for that.. it deserves a lot of recognition. The only complains possible, are the aging visual effects. At the time, they were almost revolutionary, but now.. it aged a little.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
