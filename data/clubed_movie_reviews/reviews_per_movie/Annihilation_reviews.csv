Atmospheric,"After watching this film I read the reviews voted ""most helpful,"" which all were long lists of plot holes and logical inconsistencies. They are absolutely right. I didn't think about it while watching the film, but when it's pointed out, yeah, nothing in this movie makes much sense.But I still really liked it. It's creepy and atmospheric and more concerned with the psychology of people on a suicide mission than on the nuts and bolts of scientific investigation. It's often intense , usually beautiful, well acted, and had some really weird and mesmerizing moments.I won't argue that you should forgive it for its plot holes, or that it has any deep meaning, or anything like that. In fact, it's probably easier to make a convincing argument against the movie than for it. I'm just saying, I really liked it.ADDENDUM: I looked at the user reviews recently (2024) and the top reviews are no longer lists of plot holes. The people who enjoyed the movie, like me, have since my review pushed the naysayers down. Which I fully support.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Strange, abstract, mesmeric","I've thought about this film for days after seeing it. I don't even know what specifically I've been thinking about, all I can say is it left a big impression on me. I disagree with those who say it's intellectual. I don't think it is nor was it intended to be. It's visceral, primal, just like the world inside The Shimmer.For me, films work on three hierarchical levels: at the very basic, they should be entertaining. All films should succeed here (but not all do, which is why we should rightly slam those that don't!). Then, there are films that are not only entertaining but also elicit an emotional response; they move us in some way. Finally, there are entertaining films that are moving but also have meaning; they resonate on a deeper, often metaphysical level. To my mind, Annihilation achieves all three.Forget the plot holes. They exist in every film, otherwise they wouldn't be stories. Some of my favourite films have canyon-sized plot holes and inconsistencies. If you analyse any film you'll find them, and often you don't have to look very hard, e.g. Back to the Future. Do the plot holes and gaps in logic stop BTTF from being a great film? Not to my mind, because I'm invested in the movie. Plot holes only matter to me when they draw me away from the film; if it fails to entertain me.Does the plot in Annihilation even really matter? The film is about the experience, the visuals and audio, the curiosity, the suspense. A world that could only be accessible to us in our imaginations is here brought to life on the screen. It asks a lot of questions but isn't interested in the answers. It's bold, brave, challenging. Some of it is spectacular, some of it less so. Naturally, that will split opinion, but we've become too accustomed to the ready-packaged ""Happy Meal Movies"" that the studios churn out for us. We're addicted to them like we're addicted to sugary fast food. We should welcome any film that attempts to wean us off that and broaden our palates.This is a proper cinematic film, so what a shame it is that here in the UK (and many other countries) we were denied the pleasure of seeing it on the big screen. I can only imagine how even more beguiling and entrancing the experience would've been.Turn off the lights, switch off your phones, and sit back and feed your imagination and sense of wonder. I know that's why I watch and love films. 8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not quite shimmering inside fear,"Saw 'Annihilation' because it was recommended by a friend, and also the idea was absolutely brilliant and one of the most unique for any film seen recently and the trailer showed a lot of promise. Also have a lot of appreciation for sci-fi/horror, Alex Garland's previous work is very interesting and Natalie Portman has given some great prior performances.Can definitely see why 'Annihilation' has proven to be so polarising with audiences and IMDb reviewers. Had problems with it myself and it didn't quite match up to the brilliance of the idea, but had also a lot of admiration for its brave if imperfect execution and bold ambition. It almost does live up to its idea, but doesn't quite. As somebody who has seen her fair share of films with potentially good concepts marred by underwhelming, and in a lot of cases terrible, execution, that was refreshing.'Annihilation' is uneven and has problems. Most of the characters, apart from Lena and to a lesser extent Ventress (there was a little with Cass but only for two or so lines in one short scene), are underwritten archetypes, Josie was not very memorable and there was absolutely no point to the man in the stuff with the affair.Lena's back-story was mixed. It is very nuanced and affecting in the scenes between her and Kane, but is far from successful in the stuff with the affair, which felt out of place, pointless, came out of nowhere when introduced, was ended very quickly and never heard from again. The dialogue is very clunky at times, particularly with Anya and some of the back-story, while there are some less than logical character behaviours and some bogus science, especially the explanation for the mutated insides (beyond moronic and nearly ruined one of the film's most stay-with-the-viewer scenes).Not entirely sure what my stance on the final half an hour is. It is choreographed cleverly in movement, is visually stunning, is an atmosphere whirlwind and does probe though and discussion. It is also one of the strangest last 30 minutes of any film seen in a while and it takes a lot for me to be confused, this portion of the film was a head-scratcher for me and the aftermath discussion with my sister didn't really clear things up. If it was meant to be ambiguous or open-ended, it for my tastes was taken too far, don't mind being challenged but being confused is a no-no (in no way intended to be snobbish).However, 'Annihilation' looks wonderful, one of the best-looking films seen by me recently. Some of the landscapes are pretty spectacular, as is the look of the shimmer. The creatures are very well done, especially the bear creature, and evoke a great deal of creepiness. It's beautifully and atmospherically shot and stylishly edited.The music is haunting and ominous, doing a great providing slow-building suspense and mystery without making it too obvious prematurely. Some clever use of sound too. Some of the dialogue is thought-provoking, like with the interrogations.Regardless of any reservations with some of the storytelling, 'Annihilation' is a triumph in terms of atmosphere and as an experience film. There is a slow-building tension that doesn't become dull, enough of it is thought-provoking, tense and emotional and there is a subtle tension. Two scenes stand out, and are two of the most disturbing scenes of any film in a long time. One was with the mutated insides, word of warning- don't watch this while eating, being someone who made that mistake. The other was the second bear attack, a creepy build up then crescendoing in a way that was unnerving and truly frightening. The film is also thematically interesting, familiar themes in both the genre and in Garland's previous work but built on a grander level.Most of the acting was good, especially the astonishing Natalie Portman giving one of her better performances since 'Black Swan'. Oscar Isaac and Jennifer Jason Leigh are the best in support and Gina Rodriguez fares quite well. Tessa Thompson is too underused to make an impression and her character too bland. Garland directs with great skill.Overall, not quite brilliant and sometimes frustrating but ambitious, admirable and interesting. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good sci-fi with refreshing touch. Enjoy it, don't intellectualise it.","It's hard to find novel sci-fi these days, but this movie explored a few new directions that I found entertaining. The story is good and the execution carried and developed the suspense well. Sometimes a movie needs to be rated as how engaging it is, how it kept your attention and how it made you feel, not how many ""plot holes"" there are, how ""logical"" it was and such intellectual drivel. Enjoying a movie is like drinking a beer - you like it or you don't, but please don't give me a diatribe on the size of the bubbles and whether the colour is golden amber or light gold. Who cares? I enjoyed the movie and the acting and was engaged to the end. Which means in entertainment value: Goal achieved.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Very dark and bizarrely beautiful sci-fi masterpiece, but I can also see why some don't like it.","'ANNIHILATION': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The new science fiction horror flick from writer/director Alex Garland (who also performed both duties on 2014's 'EX MACHINA'). It's about a biologist who volunteers to lead an expedition into a dangerous environmental zone, after her husband comes out of the zone seriously injured, and the sole survivor of his expedition. It's based on the novel, of the same name, by Jeff VanderMeer. The film stars Natalie Portman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson, Tuva Novotny and Oscar Isaac. It's gotten nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics, but it also performed really poorly at a test screening (which prompted a Netflix release overseas, instead of a theatrical one). I think the film is a very dark and bizarrely beautiful sci-fi masterpiece, and I can also see why a lot of people won't like it.A year has passed since a team of soldiers entered an environmental disaster zone, and never returned. One soldier, named Kane (Isaac), suddenly reappears, much to the desperate relief of his biologist wife Lena (Portman), but he doesn't remember where he's been or how he got home. Then he has a sudden medical emergency, and is rushed to a hospital. In an attempt to help him, Lena decides to join a team of all female scientists, on an expedition back into the environmental zone. Things of course don't go as planned.The movie is very hauntingly beautiful, and it's especially highlighted by an awesomely haunting score, and some breathtaking visuals. The story is interesting, but it's definitely slow-paced, and the climax is much more of an intellectual payoff than a spectacular action scene (which many viewers might be hoping for). So I can definitely see why some people would hate this film, but I loved it. It's one I definitely won't forget anytime soon too, and it's great to see Natalie Portman (my old favorite actress) back in top form!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Do you need all the answers and a nice tight ending? If so, don't watch.","Do you need all the answers and a nice tight ending? If so, don't watch. I say that not because I look down on anyone who needs that. Sometimes I need that. This is one of those more ethereal thinkers that some like and some don't though there is some pretty good action too. There are several scenes that honestly just scared the crap outta me. The acting is good. The effects are good. The premise is interesting. From the reviews, I was expecting much more glaring plot holes and fewer questions which were actually answered. I am trying to avoid spoilers so let me just say that I thought that while there were not a lot of concrete answers, we got some good theories proposed.In slamming the movie, I saw one reviewer compare it to Sunshine, which he also hated. That review was what actually flipped the switch and got me to watch it, but I'd say that is a good test. If you don't like movies like Sunshine (also written by Alex Garland), you probably won't like this.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Visual excellence!,I thought that this would end up in the 'impossible to film' pile but I feel they have truly captured the mystery and dread of the environment that is portrayed on screen.

A brilliant movie hidden in a mediocre movie,"The only advice I can give to anybody going to see Annihilation is: stick with it. I definitely was close to checking out around the middle point, but quickly my interest was piqued and in the blink of an eye the movie turned into a profound, 2001 meets Under The Skin meets Predator surreal science fiction near- masterpiece.The first half is so patiently mediocre that the second half almost feels like a completely different movie, making the movie a mixed bag but one that's totally worth it. Some of the performances are great, some are okay, and at least one is noticeably bad. Natalie Portman turns in a great performance (she carries the entire film) and Jennifer Jason Leigh gives a reserved and underplayed angle to a well worn out archetype. The side characters however, like Gina Rodriguez and Tessa Thompson, are mostly annoying and sometimes border on being simply bad. Oscar Isaac is very good.Most of the technical choices are good. The cinematography isn't particularly flashy but it captures the world behind the shimmer in all of it's messed up glory (the last twenty minutes are truly a thing to behold). The music choices are also a mixed bag. Soft strum guitar comes in at random intervals and doesn't really work, but the dark, brooding thump of a certain synth track really gives you a sense of cosmic horror.I don't want to spoil anything, so I'm going to leave it at that. Go support this movie, even if it isn't perfect. There are so many great things about it that they way outweigh the flaws.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"No gloves, no flashlights","It is just disappointing that movies like this don't cover the basics. Touching clearly contaminated organisms with bare hands as a biologist is completely ludricous. Or step into water with a mutated body, and then put your hand in it.And of course, running after an unknown beast, in the dark and having no flashlights..... of course...When did moviemakers become so lazy and inept. The same was with movies like alien promethius. Exploring an alien planet without any protective gear....I lost interest halfway due to sheer irritation. The bad reception is quite earned. It was lazy and boring and totally unrealistic.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wanted to like this more than I did,"Been wanting to watch this one for some time now. It was actually not as good as I expected it to be from the hype I'd been hearing, but it was still a trippy experience none-the-less. Reminded me a bit of Event Horizon and Color Out of Space. It was slow and dragged early. The first 2/3 of the movie I'm wondering where it's going, and once we get there I'm constantly questioning if it will ever end. The cinematography was great as was the score. I probably would have enjoyed it more if I saw it much sooner, and I probably won't enjoy it as much if I revisit it. I really just wanted to like this one more.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Good cinematics and concept, but that's all","Story wise I just couldn't get a connection with any of the characters. I wasn't intrigued and there were multiple moments in the movie where I even cringed a little by the simple writing, a little let down by Alex Garland this time.. but.. CGI was on point and at least the concept itself was original enough to make it worth a watch",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Beautiful Mess,"This movie is incredibly frustrating.It reminds me a lot of Prometheus in that it's beautiful and occasionally thought-provoking, but more often than not its worldbuilding is undercut by poor character dialog, vague plot devices, and foolishly bad decisions. And it doesn't have the same cheeky self-awareness as Prometheus.Annihilation also suffers from a lack of genre definition. It dabbles in many sub-genres of sci-fi, but does very few of them well.It really is a shame too. This one had the potential to be a true fantasy/sci-fi classic with its strong worldbuilding, fascinating visuals, and attention to style that is usually reserved for genre-titans.Instead, it becomes a slightly-above-mediocre slog with wooden characters and poor pacing. It does come together a bit in the third act, but it's too little too late by that point.6.2/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A fungus among us,"This was disappointing. Just was. It turned into a CGI-fest, the psychedelia of which was supposed to substitute for a plot.

Best Sci-Fi in a long time,I found this flick a great watch especially if you watch at night in the dark with you favorite significant other. I'm sure the high paced super action type of film favored by the teen plus group will find this movie not worth the watch.

I wanted to know more and an explanation that was clearer than what I could figure. It's worth a watch.,8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Visual Masterpiece,"The film was quite interesting. It was never boring, except maybe for the first fifteen minutes. Visually, it was immaculate. From the colours to the scenery, it was most definitely a feast for the eyes. The plot gets you invested, and it certainly wasn't uninteresting. Even the ambiguity of the film isn't off-putting, but rather satisfying. The only problem I had with it was the many plot points that went nowhere and the ""scientific explanations"". Without spoiling anything, all I can say is that they could have gotten away with anything they wanted by simply not attempting to explain anything at all. Instead, they came up with scientific explanations that make no sense at all.
All in all, it was a very well made, incredible looking, interesting -and unfortunately annoying- movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Promising Premise Undone by Weak Execution,"""Annihilation"" begins with a captivating premise and a commendable lead cast, setting high expectations with its intriguing foundational idea. However, the film ultimately fails to deliver, hampered by a combination of lackluster supporting performances, tedious plot progression, and poorly executed dialogue.The main cast, led with a certain gravitas, tries valiantly to bring depth to their roles, which are unfortunately penned with little sense and surrounded by weak character development. Their strong efforts starkly contrast with the uninspiring performances from the side cast, creating a jarring imbalance that disrupts the overall harmony of the film.Dialogue throughout ""Annihilation"" feels forced and unnatural, often serving as clumsy exposition rather than meaningful character interaction. This issue is compounded by a soundtrack that, while fitting the film's theme, cannot compensate for the narrative deficiencies.Perhaps the most glaring issue is the film's conclusion, which is riddled with logic flaws and does not make sense within the established context of the story. This not only leaves the viewer unsatisfied but also questions the coherence of the entire narrative.In sum, ""Annihilation"" is a film that might attract viewers with its interesting premise and notable lead performances, but it quickly reveals itself as a frustrating experience, lacking in engaging storytelling and logical consistency. A classic case of a great idea that required much better execution to truly shine. This movie is only for die hard fans of paraterrestial films. Others better look into ""Arrival"".",,Anonymous,Horror
Beautiful pretentious crap,"If you've watched the movie ""Ex Machina"", you may notice that ""Annihilation"" is the work of the same author. Although thematically they have nothing in common, the style of Alex Garland is quite recognizable. The movie has quite an original premise, or at least I've never encountered anything like this, and it is visually beautiful, therefore in the theater, it is probably breathtaking and diverts attention from the fact that it has nothing else to offer. Characterization, which in the previous film was Garland's main asset, here is almost non-existent, so the characters are unimpressive and do not provoke sympathy. ""Annihilation"" is an SF drama-adventure with a touch of horror, but it is neither particularly dramatic, nor exciting, nor scary, yet it is full of holes and illogicality. I can not say I was bored, but with characters whose fate I did not care about and a story that did not keep me at the edge of my seat or woke up any emotions, it left me quite indifferent. There is a possibility that I did not understand the film, but it somehow seems to me that the problem is that the author himself did not have a concrete idea of what he wanted to achieve with this film, so he just let his imagination run wild without any particular goal, blurring the lack of essence, and even a common sense, by excellent cinematography.6,5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Interesting concept, flawed execution","While watching the movie, I was both engrossed by the events playing out onscreen while at the same time thinking ""this could be done better"". To me, the writing felt like it was done by a smart Middle-Schooler: smart enough to understand some science concepts and have a few interesting ideas, but too naive in the world to create realistic or logical human behavior.There are just too many times that things occur that have no sense or logic. I'm not talking about the ""alien"" aspect, which is supposed to be somewhat mysterious and incomprehensible, but about the way that the humans in the story act or react to what's going on. The way that the government is handling the phenomenon seems strangely hands-off for what should be the most important event in the history of humanity, and the individuals involved make lots of odd decisions just to drive the story forward.On top of that, there is a framing device where a survivor is being interrogated about the events of what is shown throughout the movie, and it not only doesn't provide any additional illumination to bother with the clunkiness, it tends to deflate a lot of the tension by giving away certain plot points before you see them on screen. The ending is more just vague for the sense of being mysterious rather than making you really ask questions afterward. I suspect that if you asked the Director how the ending related to the rest of the movie, he would't be able to give more of an answer than he wanted things to be left open-ended.Finally, the characters are all fairly morose and sedated. There's a (weak) explanation in the movie for this, but the overall low energy makes you not care too much about any of the characters.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dazzling sci-fi puzzle with no easy answers,"Annihilation is based on a novel of the same name by Jeff Vandermeer, a writer specialized in a literary sub-genre known as ""weird fiction"". This book is the first from a 
trilogy; however, director-screenwriter Alex Garland (""Ex Machina"") wrote this adaptation before the next two books were even published. 
It follows the story of a Lena, a biologist with military background, whose life has been shattered by the disappearance of her soldier husband who had gone on a secret 
mission into an ecological disaster area presumably harboring an alien presence. Lena will be recruited as part of a scientific expedition into the unknown that will try 
to find some answers. As someone who have read the books, I appreciate the way the director has made this story his own, taking enough from the book to make the story 
recognizable, but at the same time making his own interpretations and connections, expanding on its themes and characters. There is much wonder, weirdness and visual poetry 
to be found in the beautiful and exceptionally well crafted film, and to my surprise there is also plenty body horror and sudden outbursts of gnaly monster action.
The movie weaves different timelines in a very seamless way, with a combination of economy and elegance that is both eloquent and easy to follow; this makes it possible to introduce 
different layers of meaning within the narrative (psychological, scientific, philosophical), and to tackle big themes without becoming pretentious or obtuse. The film contains 
memorable dialogue not included in the original novel and the characters are much more fleshed out (the conversation between the biologist and the psychologist about the 
nature of self destruction is a highlight, and a pivotal moment).
This is a project where you can clearly appreciate the simbiotic relationship between two highly imaginative thinkers (perhaps the best collaboration since Kubrick and Arthur
C. Clarke in ""2001: An Space Odyssey""). ""Annihilation"" represents the type of reflexive science fiction that ponders about our place in the cosmos, our intrinsic mutability,
and the horrors this conjures; it amounts to a surreal, sciency phantasmagoria about desintegrating identity, deeply rooted in cosmic horror. And I have no words to describe that climax apart from saying it left me in complete awe. This is 
for sure a new sci-fi classic that consolidates Garland as one of the major sci-fi visionaries of our time.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A mixed bag bolstered by a fantastic finale, striking visuals, and challenging themes","Annihilation is another solid entry in the dark, cerebral sci-fi genre for director Alex Garland, though compared to his debut (Ex Machina) it is decidedly less consistent. The film's somber atmosphere and otherworldly visuals are its major strengths. There are some truly striking and memorable images in this film that manage to be alien, haunting, and disarmingly beautiful, often all at the same time. The final act of the film is certainly its centerpiece and is where its most powerful and piercing images reside. These final 20 minutes are where the film reaches its full potential, offering up a nearly wordless denouement that is hypnotic, visually spectacular, and unsettlingly bizarre. It's certainly worth seeing just for this sequence.What comes before the finale is more of a mixed bag. I get the sense that the core goal for this film was to capture that warped, uncanny quality of like-minded classic sci-fi films like Tarkovsky's Stalker while exploring the nature of identity and other philosophical and psychological themes. It is at its best in its most uncompromising and avant-garde moments that dive head-first into achieving that goal. However, there are a considerable number of sequences in the film that feel more traditional and comparatively uninspired, more along the lines of what you would see in a less heady and ambitious sci-fi thriller. Given that Garland was picked up by a major studio (Paramount) for this release based on the success of Ex Machina, which was a much smaller and more independent production, I have to wonder if these were concessions made to the studio to make the film more accessible to a wide audience.On further investigation, there is some evidence to support this idea as Paramount reportedly nearly forced Garland to significantly alter the finale due to poor test screenings, fearing the film was ""too intellectual"" and would not play well to a wide audience. Ultimately, Garland fought and won the battle to keep the film unaltered, though the result was that Paramount backed out on giving it an international theatrical release, shifting the rights to Netflix instead for regions outside of the U.S., Canada, and China. This kind of pressure from major studios is so often what suffocates the artistic integrity of directors and, although Garland succeeded in keeping the film unaltered for a hefty price, it's possible that this pressure influenced the film and contributed to the clash between the more uncompromising elements and the somewhat mundane, typical thriller sequences.Still, the film at large succeeds as a worthy addition to the genre even if it doesn't quite reach the artistry of a film like Under the Skin (a much more uncompromising modern sci-fi classic that I highly recommend if you enjoyed this). Although I didn't love the whole film, I wholeheartedly recommend it to fans of the genre based on the strength of its visuals and its fantastic final act. It certainly further establishes Garland as a talent to watch and I'm excited for his future output, especially if he's able to work with a studio that is willing to trust him with full creative control.Strong 3.5/5",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Visuals and Sound will Take Your Breath Away,"Alex Garland loudly and impressively announced his presence in the directing world in 2015 with his debut film, Ex Machina. His follow up doesn't disappoint, as he once again showcases a talent for boldly bringing sci-fi to the big screen in a thoughtful and visually awing way.With that said... this movie isn't as clean as Ex Machina. It's clunky in its delivery of the film's message, which is foggy. I'm still not certain what this movie is about.Is it about the different ways that we self-destruct? What we do to hurt ourselves without even necessarily being aware of it? Or is it about life and change? What at first seems like destruction or annihilation is actually just an alteration or even an evolution.Again, the answer is unclear. But the good news is that didn't bother me. I enjoyed the heck out of this movie!Does every scene work? No. Are certain plot lines about main characters' relationship issues necessary? No. But none of the flaws mattered much to me because I found the rest of the movie to be so magnetic. The visuals and music attached to this magical, dreamlike place-the shimmer-sucked me in and left me in awe for extended sequences.Certain scenes, especially moments in the movie's second half, are so captivating that the flaws and underdeveloped aspects that make up the rest of the movie seem irrelevant.The movie takes your breath away in different ways. Sometimes it's terrifying. Other times it's spectacularly beautifully original. Other times it's befuddling. I enjoyed it all.That's why I look past the story's weaknesses. I've opted to focus on the mesmerizing depiction of the area/the shimmer. Bringing that to the big screen feels like a spectacular feat of filmmaking.The performances from the actors are all fine. Nothing wowing, which is a bit disappointing considering how the loaded the cast is. Tessa Thompson is an absolute comet. Natalie Portman is well-respected for good reason. Oscar Isaac crushes every movie he's in. He does an admirable job in Annihilation. All the actors do.I certainly prefer charismatic, sparkling eyes Isaac, but he flexes his versatility here by playing a spacey, confused dude. An odd moment worth mentioning: Oscar Isaac vacillates in and out of a southern accent in one scene. It's jarring and inexplicable.But most viewers probably won't notice that. There's a chance that I imagined the whole thing. This movie can mess with your mind (in a fun way). I consider this a must-see for sci-fi fans and anyone in the mood for an otherworldly experience but doesn't want to use hallucinogenic drugs.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
intriguing but flawed,"A meteor strikes a lighthouse. A shimmer descends and slowly expands. It's three years later. While a cover story is maintained, the military has been unsuccessfully investigating the phenomenon. Lena (Natalie Portman) is a biology professor and former army soldier. Her military husband Kane (Oscar Isaac) is damaged after returning from the Shimmer. He is the sole survivor of his expedition. At the military base, psychologist Dr. Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is leading the next expedition which is all female. Lena decides to join them.This is Alex Garland's next film after Ex Machina. It is fascinating sci-fi but also flawed. There is no denying the visual imagination and moody atmosphere. At times, it is great horror and quite frankly, I want more body horrors. There are ideas and images never seen before. The bear cry is incredible. The flower people and the glass trees are beautiful. It is all to Garland's credit that this has his signature vibe. This is a great unique vision but the flaws do hold it back.First, the flashforward wrap-around gives away too much of the ending. The movie does insert a little uncertainty with the climax but it would be so much more compelling to leave the finish without any clues. The flashforward gives no additional tension and only acts to drag down the pacing without being useful. Second, three years is too long. It's hard to believe that the secret could be kept for three years. What about birds and sea life that migrate away from the Shimmer? It seems logical that some birds would mutate. By squeezing the time span to something like three days, it would increase the logic and the intensity. It gives the crisis immediacy. One would also expect the military would figure out some basic stuff. They should at least have a menagerie of mutant creatures. Third, the lighthouse is right next to the ocean. One would think it's easier to travel there by boat. I assume flying would be too dangerous but the movie should deal with a fast boat idea. Finally, this has a nice horror vibe but it could have been truly disturbing. Garland has a better eye for beauty than horror. He is more concerned with visual rather than plot logistics. The movie is beautiful and moody but the writing is sloppy and the pacing is halting.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Three reasons you may not like this film,"I found this film tense, thrilling, beautiful, imaginative and intriguing. I'm bemused by the number of highly negative reviews here, but have three possible explanations. The first is that the main protagonists are all women, which seems to bother some viewers. I found this aspect a breath of fresh air, with interesting and strong female characters that develop and are revealed over the course of the film. The second that may not appeal to lovers of standard Hollywood fare is that the pace is somewhat slow and thoughtful. However, this adds a wonderful air of mystery and suspense. I'm pleased to see another reviewer below also saw a comparison with Tarkovsky's Stalker in this sense (though of course nothing can compare to his cinematography). Here, the tranquil or tense atmosphere is punctuated by some scenes of exceptional horror that really shake you. And the third is that there is no nicely packaged ""answer"". There are several possible explanations for the ""shimmer"" as we go on, but I don't think there is any clear right one. The characters actually discuss this ambiguity themselves, so I do believe it is completely intentional. Finally I would add that the music is amazing - some amazing atmospheric industrial sounding tracks by Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury. One of the rare films I would watch again.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Visually lovely but structurally a mess,"I honestly got bored and started looking for the next film to watch before it had ended.

A Mind-Bending Sci-Fi Masterpiece,"Sometimes you see a good movie, sometimes you see a great movie, and sometimes you see a movie that has such sheer ambition and grandiosity that you can't help but marvel at what the medium of film is able to accomplish. Annihilation generates so much wonder in a two-hour runtime that the it feels like its bursting at its seams. It makes every other movie that has come out in last several years feel diminutive in comparison. Natalie Portman yet again delivers a staggering performance, and one that manages to stand out against the engulfing nature of her environment. To give away anything deeper would rob you of some of the unbounded awe the film will give rise to, so I will stop there.The world built in Annihilation is so rich, terrifying, and mystifying. In the middle of the film, I couldn't help but think how I could spend another ten hours in that chair just exploring what else it had to share. I'm more than thankful I was able to even spend two hours there.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Very Unique Film - Enjoyed It Thoroughly,"Though many will see the beginning as slow, but boys is continuing watching worth, I found this to be a very unique and refreshing film in the wake of super hero trash and remakes/sequels. You know the story already, if you don't watch the trailer, and even the trailer doesn't even scratch the surface of the mind being descent into the unknown. I found the pacing and structures of the film to be well made, as well as the direction, the soundtrack only enhanced the unique visuals ans scenes of intensity. While the story seems vague and predictable, but the film takes a hard right turn, blowing your mind. I can't tell you how much I wanted to clap at the final twist.I have a feeling many people won't fully understand, as the film is highly sophisticated when it comes to scientific explanations about whats supposedly going on. You will have so many question while you watch the film. Te only real things a disliked was the opening and some of the sub-plots. I found the opening an odd choice by the director and expended different, and there were several sub-plots I found to be unnecessary. But these were just minor inconveniences and didn't really take me out of the film experience.I would highly recommend this.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

OMG. That was painful,"This film is all over the place, but at its core, it is supposed to be telling us how ""STRONG"" a group of female scientists can be while carrying automatic weapons. Yawn. They looked like a bunch of freaking female scientists carrying automatic weapons & that is NOT a compliment.
I suppose the ""Shimmer"" is supposed to be some kind of intergalactic cancer. All the women are ""damaged"" (in plenty of ways). They spray paint most of the stuff bright greens, pinks & yellows to alert you that it is not ""natural"" but some form of mutation.
How long did it take any of them to realize that if this thing causes mutations, it is causing same inside them ASAP?
Why didn't they send the exploratory group in by BOAT? Wouldn't that be a faster & safer way to reach a freaking coastal lighthouse, which seems to be Ground Zero for the problem?
If not for the extensive use of ""diversity symbols"", this would have never been made. It simply stinks. ""SciFi"" means laughable ""science fiction"" & this thing gives ""SciFi"" a lousy name.",,Anonymous,Horror
"It has issues, but we should support this type of film making","I completely disagree with the 1 star reviews, it certainly is not a 1 star film. This film is by no means perfect but I quite enjoyed it. It has good acting from Portman and Leigh an intriguing concept and stunning visuals.I largely agree that the decision to send this team in as they were was unrealistic, I think some exposition would have been good to understand what had been tried so far because you do wonder why an armoured unit or missiles wouldn't have been successful and I don't believe that any country wouldn't resort to that after months of failure. This slight detachment from what I consider to be realistic is what sets this film apart from a 10/10 film like Arrival for me.Having said that, I wish people would be a bit more forgiving. Hollywood pumps out a large amount of rubbish and the fact that the film studios were too scared to release this to cinema world wide just emphasises my concern. We should support the endeavour to make something a bit more intellectual and thought provoking even if it doesn't hit the highs we want.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Must See,"Alex Garland's second directorial outing after the excellent Ex Machina, this brainy, metaphysical sci-fi is even more ambitious and more amazing. But its challenging conclusion could be a hard sell. Based on Jeff VanderMeer's novel, Annihilation slightly resembles Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker (1979), a highly artistic masterpiece from a much braver time, when audiences were less likely to balk at ambiguity. Like Ridley Scott did in Blade Runner 2049, Garland combines unusual, imaginative visuals, ideas, and sounds with more traditional audience-aimed thrills -- but he does so far more seamlessly than Scott. The film is less focused on climactic battles, instead heading toward a far more poetic, surreal ending.
The shape of Annihilation is nothing short of brilliant, with a linear, minimalist starting point that consists of simple, straightforward images (like a lighthouse). It then opens up like a strange, exotic flower, following different offshoots to new, unexpected points in its unpredictable world. The movie is admirable for featuring five women (and no men) as the characters who embark on the journey; Portman's performance especially makes it an emotional one. But given that the movie is sometimes creepy and perhaps even unsettling, it sets itself up as being more of a cult favorite -- it's closer to 2001: A Space Odyssey than to Star Wars -- than a mainstream hit. Still, if you prefer your sci-fi deep, then you're in for a treat.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horrifically disappointing,"The intriguing trailer with ""The Alien"" melody sold me on watching Annihilation in theaters instead of waiting for it to appear on Netflix. The synthesized notes promised an eerie, captivating, and horrific journey into Alex Garland's adaptation of the first book of the ""Southern Reach"" trilogy. And horrific is right. Horrifically disappointing.
 
The film follows Lena (Natalie Portman) and fellow scientist/volunteers into a mysterious ""Shimmer"" that changes the land it encroaches upon. All of the previous military volunteers that have entered are never heard from again, except for Lena's husband (Oscar Issac). In order to save her husband from mysterious health problems, Lena joins a group of scientists to study the ""Shimmer"" and reach its core at the lighthouse. Interestingly enough, the group is all female, which reflects our current climate of the all female dream team (Ghostbusters, Ocean's). The film has a great cast with amazing performances, blah blah blah. Okay, now that we got that out of the way, let's get to the negatives.
 
In the ""Shimmer,"" the group makes groundbreaking discoveries, while attempting to survive. But the film digs its own grave when it comes to caring about the characters and building suspense due to its opening, which shows Lena post journey out of the ""Shimmer"" being interviewed by scientists. She mentions who dies, who goes missing, and the very fact that she's there in a lab room confirms that she survives as well. So scenes later where danger is imminent, we already have a good idea as to what will happen. Talk about fun.
 
When we compare Annihilation with Alex Garland's previous sci-fi film, Ex Machina, the flaws become obvious. Unlike Ex Machina, Annihilation is not focused. It's an adventure, drama, fantasy, horror, mystery, and thriller. There's the aches of love, the influence of psychology, the beauty of evolution, the creation of monsters, the existence of aliens, and the crisis of existence. The film spreads itself too thin, with more ambitious topics than there are baddies in Spider-Man 3. I would rather watch a story that delves into one or two of these ideas, than try to tackle many parts of a different whole.
 
Like Arrival (which is a much better alien mystery), Annihilation relies on several twists of its own. But compared to the weight that they're given, the twists don't hold enough impact or surprise. You could even say that the final twist is a failed attempt at an Inception like ending. With Inception, viewers are so engrossed with the dream world and its implications that the twist of whether Leo's character is still in a dream or not comes naturally. In Annihilation, a question is asked in the end which falls flat on itself like a teenager trying to sound deeper than s/he actually is. The question shouldn't have been asked. It easily takes away the buildup of the final scene and makes the whole ending laughable.
 
David Ellison, financier at Paramount, was concerned that the film was ""too intellectual"" and ""too complicated"" and wanted changes to be made to appeal to a broader audience (in order words, dumb it down). I couldn't disagree more, not for the same reasons as the director, but because there's nothing complicated about the film. Intellectual? Sure, it deals with science. But the actual science within the ""Shimmer"" is completely fictional and relies on the entertainment value to make any of it believable. Complicated? Now that's just an insult to moviegoers. Although don't be surprised if you run across several people who bought into the film as though-provoking. On the surface, it's shrouded with stupendous fantasy. But at its very core, like the one in the ""Shimmer,"" it is as purposeless as the alien that lives there.

"Amazing, thought provoking film","Annihilation will be one of those love it or hate it movies. There is nothing spoon fed to you in this and for some that means being confused, lost, or turned off. For others like me it means considering possibilities, what's next, and what does it mean. The story is slow but magical in building up the tension through the films visuals and in the light ""terror"". I wasn't completely able to put myself in the shoes of these women but I could image my reaction to some of what the characters were experiencing and then wondering why there wasn't more panic, only to balance that with their scientific curiosity and awe. These weren't teenagers overcome by zombies or slashers. These are trained professional scientists in the field study something beyond our science and understanding. I think the film comes together great with only a few holes here or there. And the ending is one that leaves you going....hmmm.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cryptic and ultimately unsatisfying,"A diverse group of women investigate a mysterious phenomenon, ""the shimmer"", a growing zone of scintillating opaqueness which seems to have swallowed up the special-ops teams sent in previously. Within, they discover strange hybrid organisms as they try to get to the focal point, the lighthouse where the phenomenon began. Although perhaps some kind of cancer metaphor, the film doesn't really make a lot of sense and there is little exposition. Despite tossing off technical cell biology terms such as 'Hayflick limit', the 'science' in the film ('refracting DNA'??) might as well be magic (even if the basic premise was sound, the developmental time course makes no sense). There are some outstanding visuals, notably the crystal trees toward the end, which reminded me of J.G. Ballard's book ""The Crystal World"". Overall, the movie seems to have stemmed from special effects in need of a story rather than vice versa - which, unfortunately, is not uncommon these days.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The so-called center piece, ""Shimmering"" was nothing but a foolish computerized graphic effect. Five women, after several special force teams disappeared behind the ""Shimmering veil"" , carrying guns(what for?) into the unknown, was just as ridiculous as you may imagine. The screenplay just felt like a half baked pie, most part of it still not baked through yet. If this film was adapted from a novel, then this novel definitely not good enough either. Since this film at the end proved to be just a pointless nonsense without proper answer and reasonable ending, it only showed that the whole project was going nowhere and when a usual length of a movie time was fulfilled, it just ended with a WTF?! a clueless final scene. I don't know how to define this film's genre, a horror film, a sci-fi film, or a mixture of sci-fi horror or, whatever.

Annihilation (2018),"No relation to Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, fortunately. Alex Garland really blew me away with his directional debut with Ex Machina. Was an absolutely enthralling, smart sci-fi film that worked on so many levels. Naturally, I was very excited for Annihilation when I first saw the trailer. Natalie Portman is also one of my favorite actresses and one of the top performers working today so this was something I couldn't wait to see. Having seen it, I have to say I'm still processing the film but its very good.Lena (Portman) is a biologist who goes to explore a mysterious area called ""The Shimmer"" with four other women. Her husband recently came back after a year of being in the Shimmer and he has been acting and reacting oddly. Lena soon realizes that the world within the Shimmer is odd; plants and animals mutate unnaturally and the landscapes are ever changing. There's much more to talk about plot wise in this film bt I'd rather not spoil anything at all.First of all, visually this film looks great. As Garland says, its made for the big screen. I'm not that crazy about films premiering on Netflix and stuff so it sucks this film won't get an international release. Second, the film is slow but brooding and thriving in its complexities. It sort of reminded me of Arrival at certain stages. The film takes you on a visual and conceptual journey, whether you are coherently following along or not. Portman and Jennifer Jason Leigh shine, as usual.I can tell a lot of people are going to write this film off as bad. I can already see that the right people are praising it and giving the film the due it deserves. Garland delivers an unflinching smart sci-fi thriller that stays with you. Its well acted and has interesting concepts that don't always make perfect sense, yet are mind bendingly entertaining. Ex Machina is a better film but Garland follows up with something close in quality. I'm certain that after a re-watch this film will get an 8 from me.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A film suffering from an identity crisis,"The screenplay by writer and director Alex Garland was seriously flawed in his noble attempt of a sci-fi film. For starters, it's been listed as a ""Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"" on IMDb and added ""Action, Horror"" on other sites, when it's entirely a sci-fi film... or really tried hard to be one.Another obvious identity issue of this film was the score - one minute a suspenseful tone, the next a Western themed acoustic guitar, then some great sci-fi undertones. This film was all over the place trying to be an intellectual art piece, then a mind-expanding mystery, then a lethargically paced pretentious plot mess, then a cinematic masterpiece, then a Hollywood big-screen sci-fi.No wonder the executive producers where bickering throughout the production and final cut including where/how to distribute this film.The slowly paced almost 2 hour length really needed to be cut down to 90 mins max and much faster paced.The lead actors were also rather bland, but I blame the director for failing to direct them properly and his slowly paced screenplay.My initial rating from the start of this film was only a 4/10. I added 2 stars for some incredible visuals, and another 1 star for the last 20 mins of the film that actually felt like I was watching a great sci-fi.Thus my final rating is a 7/10 which is a shame, as this film had the potential to easily be a 9 or 10/10, but instead flopped at the box office by suffering its identity crisis.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Thought-Provoking and Demanding a Re-Watch,"After Alex Garland's first film, Ex Machina showed me that true science fiction in cinema is not dead, I was looking forward to yet another sci-fi film by him. Whether you like both of his films or not, you can't say that they are worthless and poorly-crafted. Whether or not you liked this film, you should be able to appreciate this on a technical/visual level. If Ex Machina proved anything, Annihilation further reinforces the idea that cinema is true art if it makes viewers contemplate it or look for meaning in it themselves.There are enough plot summaries here, so I will not be adding to that list. Instead, I will tell you that the story is excellently-paced and moves quickly after being gripped instantly by one of the opening shots. The set-up to the film perfectly balances the mystery surrounding this bubble-like layer called ""The Shimmer"" (*cue overwhelming, disorienting synth sound*) and the confusion of what happened to lead to a specific scene. We are told just enough to not lose interest in what's happening, but not enough to be able to predict what will happen next. This allows Garland to brilliantly keep viewers on the edge of their seats during scenes that would have been too comfortable and enjoyable had the suspense and intrigue not been built up so effectively.The only flaws that I have with this film are with the characters and their development. During the first half, the characters develop at a great pace and I felt that I would truly get to know each main character emotionally and psychologically by the end of the film. However, after three important characters are given good backstories and emotional attachment is built to them, no more characters are elaborated on for the rest of the film, which caused me to not become as invested as I could have been in the rest of the characters' fates. Alex Garland is very skilled at developing the characters that he does. Part of the reason that Ex Machina worked so well was that there were so few characters, so you really got into all of their psyches and personalities by the end. Annihilation develops certain major characters flawlessly, but forgets other major characters that could have helped the story feel more emotional.The visuals in this film are absolutely incredible and stand out almost as much as the thought-provoking ending. If you weren't engaged in the story, the visuals will keep your eyes glued to the screen. The cinematography and lighting of scenes that take place in The Shimmer are well-composed and beautiful. The effects are made to look more unbelievable and crazy as opposed to Ex Machina, where the visual effects make a real person look like an unrealistic, real person. Even though February is barely over, I would strongly consider this a contender for the Best Visual Effects award at the 2019 Oscars.This film will keep me thinking about it and pondering its meaning until another film with an intellectual meaning as strong as this one replaces it, which isn't very common. Would you rather forget an enjoyable, simple movie or remember a challenging, memorable film? If you answer to the latter, this film is certainly for you.8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Ultimately disappointing,"Annihilation is written and directed by Alex Garland who made a movie I loved, Ex Machina. Ex Machina has smart visual effects and the budget doesn't get in the way of the premise. It's a perfect match. It also has a good performance by Vikander. Obviously it gave me some expectations for this movie, but I think I can give it a fair review.First let's start with the good, I think Portman is convincing, so are a few of the other actors in her crew. The story is in broad terms an expedition checking out an anamoly in a forest, it's interesting and it's rooted in science. There are some nice visuals and overall I would say the movie makes you think a bit like Ex Machina. But it's maybe more of an ""experience"" in a way it approaches thinking compared to Ex Machina.In my opinion there are nice details to look at in this movie and the standard of effects are ok, but the visuals are cheesy, and look like overdone HDR photographs or games in many parts. The details of some of the plot is pretty bad, including a former soldier thinking a guard post on the ground as a good idea when they have a tall inaccessible guard tower to sit guard in. We know it needs to be ""scary"" and you need to set up events, but that is just so bad I won't even consider it a spoiler.I think the bigger scope of the movie, with the bigger set and the bigger set of characters is it's biggest problem. It honestly feels like a B movie you'll see in the middle of the night in your countries 5th most popular TV channel for large parts of the movie. I think the smaller scope of Ex Machina maybe concealed some of the weaknesses and maybe inexperience of the director/writer.In the end I would still recommend giving it a view, but my ultimate verdict is that it's a movie that would have needed a few more rounds in writing and planning. I honestly don't think it would have ended up on Netflix for the rest of the world if it did.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Abstract AF,"How do you describe this movie? Personally, start by ignoring the idiots that relentlessly roast this film for not spelling everything out for you. There used to be a trope in cinema where you had some ability to determine the ending of the film, thus allowing you to make your summations. But alas, everything has to be spelled out.Anyway, Annihilation is not an easy story to dissect. Basically an entity has taken over a spot of land known as The Shimmer, and despite the best efforts of many researchers, nothing has been found. It's only discovered that an all-female team might find some better results and thus a small unit is sent in to check out the abject oddity within the shimmer. Oversized animals, sentient plants, zombified animals and even crystalline trees make the world seem alien and horrifying, covered up perfectly under the sheen of sparkling lights and bright colors.Now the story is not supposed to make a whole lot of sense. Sorry to the anti-SJW Nerds who hate fap all over this film (and yes, those are the ones leading the charge) who just can't get that idea into their closed mind. I won't go on a limb and say it's the best sci-fi of all time, but for those that liked 2001, Stalker, THX-1138 and other relatively bizarre science fiction films, then you will feel at home. We never truly receive an answer as to why The Shimmer is here, for the ending really gives us few answers. Like I said earlier, it's meant to allow you to come up with your own conclusions.Is this a perfect film? No. Is it watchable? Yes. Is it good to watch with your sci-fi loving girlfriend...most certainly. I will say the only thing I did not like was the fact they somewhat vilified Portman's character, having her engage in an affair just kind of made her less sympathetic and turned a story looking for answers more into a story that was trying to seek redemption for being a cheater.

"A true sci-fi masterpiece of chaos, death and self-destruction","Alex Garland has gone into alien territory with his loose adaptation of the novel Annihilation. With his last film Ex Machina feeling like it was grounded in our reality with how the technology was presented, here Garland transported me as an audience out of the plausible and into a chaotic hybrid of a dream and nightmare.Told through very sketchy interviews by Natalie Portman's Lena, Annihilation starts out in familiar sci-fi event territory (similar to 2016's Arrival) with the reveal of a translucent unearthly wall called the Shimmer. It continues to slowly grow like an infection consuming the land with anything or anyone that enters it never returning. Enter our core group of all-woman scientists who enter the Shimmer to get answers that past expeditions have failed at. Once inside the Shimmer, the story begins shifting more into a post-apocalyptic visual style that blends Apocalypse Now with Alien and The Thing. But by the end you will feel like you experienced a dream that will make question what you saw in the Shimmer.Annihilation itself is the true theme of the story in not just about an alien force threatening our way of life through mutation and ecological destruction. Like Ex Machina in a spiritual way, Garland is really focusing on how human beings harm themselves by their own self-destructive behaviour whether it is suicidal tendencies, paranoia, pride, addiction, guilt or lying to pretend life is just perfect. Following Lena's perspective into the Shimmer, we meet the supporting cast of characters who from the start appear to be perfectly sane people from the cold-hearted psychiatrist Ventris (Jennifer Jason Leigh), the calm and shy physicist Radek (Tessa Thompson), the tough, confident medic Thorensen (Gina Rodriguez) to the kind-hearted Shephard (Tuva Novotuny). But in reality they are broken human beings made from personal loss and their own insecurities. And these faults are displayed by their reactions to the alien threats and the psychological and biological effects the Shimmer has on them. Lena as the protagonist starts as someone you automatically sympathize with but through the course of flashbacks and events you see how her questionable choices in the past may have inflicted too much damage on others within her personal relationship. By the third act, her journey through the Shimmer becomes one less of proving how good she is as a person but more about confronting her own problematic nature.The world within the Shimmer is a place that feels haunting, alien but beautiful thanks to Garland's film crew including production designer Mark Rigby, cinematographer Rob Hardy and a creepy, alien-sounding score by Geoff Barrow and Ben Salibury. The way the sunlight reflects from the Shimmer's rainbow surface and the overgrowth of colourful hybrid fungus and plant life makes the Shimmer-affected area feel like you stepped out of Kansas and entered the realm from The Wizard of Oz. And there it is filled with mutated wildlife that ranged from looking fantastical to nightmarish with their death-like appearances. Thanks to some amazing visual and practical effects, the creatures never feel like they are too exaggerated or spectacular. Yet you can't help to but to believe there is a not-of-this-world element in a fearful awe-inspiring way.In the final act, the story, much like the landscape and creatures, evolves or mutates. It becomes a surreal and cerebral visual event that left me in awe and shock with questions. After some time to think I see it perfectly reflects the question surrounding Annihilation of whether death by our own genetic and psychological devices is an end or a new start for something that can be improved.I don't personally agree with Paramount selling the international rights to Netflix, especially with the disappointing Cloverfield Paradox, but I can understand why this isn't a movie for everyone. It can be frustrating depending how you interpret the ending. The movie doesn't give you an explanation of everything as it says we don't generally always have rationale explanations for our own chaotic tendencies. For me I enjoy that kind of approach because this movie felt like true science fiction right down to its cerebral core. If you want the full out-this-world kind of experience that I got with this movie, see it in a theatre, if possible, as soon as you can before you can only watch it only in Netflix on your tv or laptop.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Thought provoking,"I'm sure after reading a couple of user reviews you'll see that there is very little mid-ground on this movie. No gray, if you will.
It seems you ether LOVE this movie or you undoubtedly HATE it. If I am being perfectly honest, I nether love nor hate this movie.
I gave Annihilation a 7 out of 10; firstly, because the visuals of this film are phenomenal! Second to none, this movie takes you to another world. A world where everything is beautiful or terrifying! 
I'd have to say Annihilation was much scarier then I thought it would be so if you're not looking for scary stay clear. 
This movie is also extremely physiological so stay clear if you don't like movies messing with your head. I personally love thought provoking movies that's why I saw this.
Natalie Portman and Oscar Issac are flawless in this film, convincing me that this is real and giving me a connection to their characters on an emotional level. However, where Portman and Issac are amazing I am truly let down by Jennifer Jason Leigh as her part seems uninteresting and useless to the plot but her acting is quiet, shy, and not convincing in any way. 7 out of 10, 2 of those lost stars belong to her and the poor script. 
The last fallen star belongs to some of the slowness of the film. There are 2 scenes that seem like they're lasting forever and nothing is happening. 
All in all, a pretty great ride with few complaints.
I would not recommend this movie to anyone who is not physiologically sound as it tries hard to play with your mind. 
Also, there is some very disturbing images that make this film have the R rating.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"As Natalie Portman replies during her interrogation scenes in Annihilation, 'I don't know'.","I don't know what writer/director Alex Garland was thinking. I don't know what the point of the film was. I don't know how so many silly plot holes could have made it into the final script. I don't know whether I ever want to see another Garland film again. I don't know what Jennifer Jason Leigh has done to her face.Natalie Portman plays biologist Lena, who volunteers to join a dangerous mission into the 'shimmer', a mysterious, expanding zone caused by an alien force. Inside the zone, Lena and her all-female cohorts encounter strange mutated creatures and fear that their own DNA is being slowly assimilated.A boring build-up to the mission; some brief excitement involving the mutated animals; a smattering of gore; lots of introspection and ponderous pretentiousness; plenty of scenes that take an awful lot of swallowing; and an ending that makes very little sense: Annihilation is the perfect companion piece to Danny Boyle's even more disappointing and even more perplexing sci-fi Sunshine, which was also penned by Garland.One thing I do know: I won't be giving this one a second watch anytime soon.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Um, it's definitely not a movie for everyone","First of all, when I first watched the official teaser of the movie I liked it and I had high expectations about it. Eventually, it was just an average movie and I have to say, it wasn't exactly what I had imagined. The movie synopsis was very interesting, mysterious and kinda innovative. Regarding the storyline, it was kinda complicated sometimes and that's the reason why I couldn't understand the point of the movie. The main characters were very interesting, kinda well-developed and likeable. The casting choices were nice and their performances were descent. I have to admit, it was a very intense movie, atmospheric and there were too many mind-blowing moments. I wouldn't consider it a scary movie, because there weren't any jumpscares. However, the bear scene was probably the creepiest part of the movie. Unfortunately, there weren't any action-filled moments during the movie. In my opinion, the cinematography and the score were both the highlights of the movie, because they were both beautiful. The opening scene was kinda predictable, but it was very mysterious and promising. The 2nd act was great, very suspenseful and I enjoyed it, a lot. Regarding the 3rd act, I have to admit I have mixed feelings about it, because it was really weird and I still don't know if I have completely understand the ending of the movie.

"In Nature's Eyes, We're the Aberration","Annihilation speaks, and I would only muddle the crystalline clarity in a retelling. Brilliant performances and gorgeous effects coalesce a fluid, telling, terrifying conclusion. In many ways, this film is a test of heart, demanding we orient ourselves against the universe, certain to be devoured. Deliberate, economic, and visionary, the volatile alien world excites and terrifies on the surface. That's just the beginning.I went to post the picture for this review, and I realized that this movie left me so speechless that I almost forgot to mention: the characters are all women scientists. Furthermore, this film takes leave from the typical plot tropes that you would expect to emerge from its premise: people, leaders, the government are all innocent. The dystopia in this film isn't human-made - it's all-natural, and this leads to the film's finest philosophical point: in nature's eyes, we're the aberration.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Very bad science fiction,This movie is so boring. I couldn't believe how boring it was. It is hard to enjoy a movie where none of the characters are likable. Natalie Portman has one expression from start to finish. I couldn't care less if she lived or died. There is one character who is a lesbian. Why that information is given to us? I don't know because it adds nothing to the storyline. Natalie Portman used to cheat on her husband before he goes missing. Again why is this information relevant to the story? No idea! It kept annoying me how little the team that goes into the Shimmer is prepared- they don't have any protective gear. They don't have any vehicle.. they have to walk...they don't seem to even have any training on how to handle dangerous situations and wild animals. Why were they chosen?

Ambitious Disappointment,"Remember when alien movies were just about little green men or robot humanoids coming to conquer Earth? Annihilation is another in a long line of modern sci-fi films to be more interested in the philosophy than the practicality of extra-terrestrials. But unlike Under the Skin or Europa Report, its ponderous nature never quite reaches its point. It's definitely a metaphor for something, but what? Aging? Marriage? Dementia? Time? Death? Perhaps a second-viewing would clear some of this up, but then I'd have to slog through this movie again.
An unknown object has crashed onto earth, causing a slowly growing ""shimmer"" wall that seems to make anyone who enters it disappear. In so many ways, it's just a lesser version of classic films. Like Tarkovsky's Stalker, it's comfortable with saying ""I don't know"", but more out of confusion than intrigue. Like Villeneuve's Arrival, it uses alien beings to talk about humanity, but with little emotional impact. Like Carpenters' The Thing, its unexpectedly and brutally gory, though not as technically impressive.
However, it's a hard movie to write-off or be complacent about, given its strangeness and ambition. The bursts of horror are fun and unique, with cool creatures and a steady directing hand. Most of all, it's visually striking cinematography and often quite beautiful production design are undeniable. Most of its issues seem to stem from the writing, which isn't just thematically unfocused, but also just full of cliched dialogue. 
With Ex Machina, Alex Garland made a strong impression with that debut. And even with all of Annihilation's script problems, his camera's eye and brainy tendencies keep him as a filmmaker worth watching.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

better than Avatar,"It's been a while since an SF movie appealed to me as Annihilation did. If I recall well, the last has been Europa Report (2013), although not to the same extent. Therefore the number of reviews disparaging Annihilation surprised me somewhat.This movie is better than Avatar, the current gold standard for all SF outside Star Wars and Star Trek franchises. Admittedly, I streamed Annihilation and saw Avatar in 3D at a movie theater. Therefore I'm even ready to concede that Avatar had better special effects. Yet it's generic and predictable Hollywood blockbuster plot pales in comparison to Annihilation.The main protagonists, in particular Natalie Portman and Jennifer Jason Leigh, outperformed what's expected of the genre. The rest of the cast did a very good job. Even Oscar Isaac with his trademark poor performance wasn't able to ruin the things.The story is suspenseful until the very end, which is, in turn, as close as it gets to a happy ending. What amazed me is that although some things in the movie were left abstract, everything was explained, as much as abstract thing may be explained in two hours of a movie.If you want to compare, Arrival (2016) which shares some motifs with Annihilation, did a much poorer job and, for that matter, left a weak impression. And if you really want to see what it means to leave abstract things unexplained, check Upstream Color (2013) by Shane Carruth.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"A beautiful science fiction, a meaningless couple drama","I don't like how they juxtapose truly good science fiction concepts with incompatible human dramas. Instead of focusing on the coherence and significance of the story, it feels like they prioritize the interpretations that will come afterwards. The first time I consciously felt this was with the series 'Nightflyers,' which came out the same year. Even though I watched the film years later, it evoked the same feeling in me.I think it's a good film in terms of exploring how alien the alien concept can be to us. It's quite refreshing to see aliens approached differently from the usual clichés, like invading our planet with a spaceship. Exploring how different they could be, the impossibility of understanding and communicating with them, and the fact that we may not share the same perception of reality is fascinating.I found it unnecessary to try to tie it into a troubled marriage. Initially, I thought it was trying to add meaning by offering a perspective on why they risked their lives and their motivations. But as the film progressed and it began to spread a depressive tone that made me think all the characters were more of a reflection of the author's mindset rather than actual individuals, my opinion changed. I felt that scenes and plot points were added solely to garner more praise for the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Carpenter's ""The Thing"" meets Tarkovski's ""Stalker""","This is Carpenter's ""The Thing"" meets Tarkovski's ""Stalker"".

I should hate this movie but I can't help but like it.,"Normally, I would scoff at films this ""silly"". However, despite the non-stop nonsense, Annihilation delivers something conceptual, almost dreamlike, which gives me the ability to accept it for what it is and actually like it. At no point do any of the so-called scientists do anything remotely scientific (other than make a few speculative remarks and observations while carelessly taking some test tube samples from mutated plants and potentially infectious dead creatures). The idea of caution simply does not exist. No tether line into the Shimmer, no back-up plan discussed, no vehicles used (quads would have been smart), complete disregard for personal safety (no masks, bunny suits, test kits, gloves, etc) -just some chicks with guns entering the unknown for basically no REAL reason. If this situation actually happened, I would think the military would probably nuke the site first, before sending a haphazard crew of military scientists in to investigate and likely die yet again. So as you watch this film, you know the story is complete rubbish, but yet your can't help but be captured by the weirdness of it all. The score, the visuals, the acting, the creature effects, are all top-notch. The pacing of the film is somewhat slow also, which I really enjoy. You have to watch it with an open mind, and just enjoy it for what it is...seeing this film makes me want to read the book, which I would hope includes a little more logic and substance.

"Beautiful, intriguing, terrifying and weird!","This is a movie that I thought I would really like, or maybe even love, after seeing the trailer. Having watched it I do like it a lot, but I also found it to be so much more weird than I could have imagined it to be. It was beautiful, intriguing, exciting and with great acting. But it was, especially towards the end, so very weird. I wanted to understand what was going on and get all the answers, but as it just got weirder I lost some of the interest for a while, just to at the very end get some of it back again. You might say it was almost like being on a rollercoaster of weirdness, with a lot of that weirdness being of the good and beautiful kind. It's like being thrown into this mysterious and beautiful, yet dangerous and terrifying, world wanting to know and understand all about it but not really getting there. I would say that the end made up for some of that, at the same time as it blew your mind to pieces. A part of me still isn't exactly sure of what to think, but still can't help but to like it.The movie being based on a novel I looked it up, wondering if perhaps I wanted to read it, and found that it is the first novel of a trilogy.

An okay Sci-fi thriller that you might say was pretty good,If you liked The Thing (2011) and Solaris (2002) you should like Annihilation.What made this movie different than most are the strong female roles.

More of the screen time was devoted to exploring the characters and the zone inside the shimmer rather than guns blazing. I felt this was also a plus.All around it was a good movie except for some decisions made while exploring inside the shimmer. Many american movies have characters do dumb things so someone can die.

"Pretty, boring.","The visuals in this movie are absolutely incredible. The set design is beautiful, the cinematography is well executed, and practical effects are reminiscent of a long past generation of sci-fi movies that didn't rely on CGI for everything. It's been a while since I've seen a movie and audibly said 'whoa' as I took in the scenery.Unfortunately the writing, particularly the dialogue, is pretty bad. It doesn't help that the delivery by some of the main cast is just weak at times when its supposed to be compelling.The *SCIENCE* aspect of this SCI-fi movie is, bafflingly, perhaps the worst aspect of the film. Everything going on is explained in long-cut exposition scenes, which would be the points of the movie where I would take a minute to rest my eyes. It's not particularly interesting or challenging unless you didn't do biology in high school, and I think these scenes could've been cut completely and the movie would even benefit.There are some scenes where the movie finally starts to build tension, but then something absurd will happen and any tension is instantly killed. I can't go into detail without spoiling the movie, but if you end up watching this for yourself, you'll definitely recognize the scenes I'm talking about.I didn't know that this movie was based off a book before watching it, but I did guess halfway through, since the whole time the movie came off as a bad book adaptation. I haven't read the book so I couldn't tell you how closely it follows the source material, but given that the only part about this movie I really enjoyed was the cinematography, I wouldn't be surprised if it was the source material that's holding this movie back.If you do decide to watch this movie, I recommend muting it. Your experience will be much better.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A great true Sci-Fi,"Don't you hate reviews where they just kind of write down a trailer?! what's the point of these pontless reviews and 7 of 10 are like it!? 
About the movie. It is the old school sci-fi. No star wars mumbo with hollywood heroes leaping from 5 storey building down into the enemies. None of that!!
This is a thought provoking master peace that requires you to carefully watch, think and then finish the thinking on your own. It's a remarkably deep movie and I can see how most people just don't get it. Deep thinking movies require a bit more... Let's face it, a lot of people are not fans of thinking and this is why this review will receive a lot of negatives - all from people who did not understand the movie and then I offended them by criticizing their intelligence. Oh well...If you liked this movie, chances are you also liked: Arrival (2016). Which also got a number of negative reviews from people who expected hollywood kungfu,but received something much deeper.Visuals: 9/10

Notable Score & Sound Design!,"The score & sound design push Annihilation from a mediocre telling of a really great script to a worthwhile watch. If you don't know of Ben Salisbury & Geoff Barrow then get to know their unique scoring work pushing newer sound design techniques into the score of everything they touch!Overall the concept is great but the execution is spotty at best, there are 3 absolutely solid scenes in this film that just have to be respected... The rest... not so much. I do like the early subtle hints in the script at what is to come, with a few not so subtle hints throughout. Other than that it's just the soundtrack that kept me watching.Solid 7.5/10 - Or a 5 without the brilliant sound design.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Still excellent years later,"I think this movie is way too intelligent for most people, hence the low rating. But I remember leaving the theater - after seeing it when it first came out - in sci-fi nerd nirvana. I just rewatched it and came away feeling just as impressed by the incredible concept and production value. It's not perfect, but it's definitely worthy of an A in my opinion. It is, however, definitely a movie that requires attention and more than a few brain cells, which is why I'm totally going to watch it again tomorrow to see what else I can find. It's also almost entirely centered on a female cast, with men appearing in the occasional scene, which might be another factor in its rating. If you're in the mood for cerebral sci-fi and don't require a male protagonist to keep your interest, you should DEFINITELY watch this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Plot holes aside, this is a very thought provoking movie","After watching Ex Machina, I immediately saw Alex Garland's next feature Annihilation and it was one of the most interesting films I've seen.Annihilation is about five scientists that sign on a dangerous mission into The Shimmer, a mysterious zone that's unlike anything on Earth.When the movie finished, I couldn't help but think about it for a long time. Yeah there are a few plot holes which I couldn't ignore but there is also so much that this film offers that makes you want to talk about and that's one of the best parts of Annihilation. This is a sci-fi that will really stick in your head. Like Ex Machina, Alex Garland implements many themes and ideas that will get fans of the film to analyse in immense detail.The movie also looks incredible. The look of The Shimmer is gorgeous and once we actually go inside it, the experience is further enhanced by the fantastic cinematography. There are some really suspenseful moments especially one including a bear that increased my heart rate and kept me on the edge of my seat. The execution of tension is done really well. The music towards the end is great and adds a great amount of intensity and atmosphere to what's taking place.The performances weren't amazing but they weren't terrible by any means. I enjoyed watching Natalie Portman and Jennifer Jason Leigh as I thought they did a good job. Gina Rodriguez and Tessa Thompson were fine. I thought they could have been a bit better. Oscar Isaac was also really good.Despite its thought provoking story, this film is nowhere near perfect. There were a couple times where I questioned characters' decisions but thankfully it didn't ruin the experience as a whole. The pacing could have definitely been better. All the events that happened before they entered The Shimmer felt a bit dull due to how slow everything progressed.Annihilation had caught my attention without a doubt. It certainly has its flaws with its pacing and some plot holes which are hard to dismiss but I love what Alex Garland is doing with the sci-fi genre. Both his movies aren't perfect but they do raise interesting questions whether it's related to AI or nature.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Annoying nonsense,"This is not a science fiction film. It is a vaguely pretty puff piece, that goes absolutely nowhere, says absolutely nothing and constantly irritates while doing so, with its lack of narrative, vagueness and utterly boring finale.It isn't true to say there are flaws in this film, because the entire thing is so fundamentally flawed and devoid of logic as to render the term meaningless.

Tragic forecast to life as we know it.,"I watched this at home on DVD. My wife looked at the trailer and decided she did not want to see it.Brought to us by the same man who brought us the excellent ""Ex Machina"" I looked forward to seeing it, and I like many of the actors. It features something brought to Earth by alien life, and it is manifest as a ""shimmer"" effect in and surrounding a lighthouse. In time it grows in the area it covers.The theme of the story plays on the fact that on Earth animal and plant life have their own DNA and own ways of cell division that results in, for example, an apple tree making apples and a human making humans. But what of that got jumbled such that different species were instead able to pool and share their characteristics? That is what this new force enables.Natalie Portman is Lena, her husband has been gone for a time, she doesn't know where, until he magically turns up. But he doesn't seem like the same person she knew. To try to solve the mystery of missing persons and to learn what exactly this ""shimmer"" is all about she joins a group of four other ladies, mostly different types of scientists, to explore the ""shimmer"" and see what they can find.Well they find all sorts of things and few of them are good. And in the end it seems that maybe in time this will trigger the annihilation of the species as we know them on Earth and eventually result in something completely different. Not necessarily bad or good, but different.Interesting concepts, I am glad I saw it, makes one think but in the end it is all science fiction. I still will sleep well tonight.",,Anonymous,Horror
Annihilation review,"Intriguing and intelligent, but also confusing, Annihilation is the kind of film that deserves a sequel or two in order to expand on ideas that sometimes feel only half-formed. Alec Garland's movie features a different kind of alien invasion - one that alters the environment it enters rather than killing those it encounters. Some do die, and in horribly imaginative ways, but it's to the film's credit that its cerebral and physical aspects complement one another so well within a relentlessly ominous atmosphere.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

6.5 would be about right,"Based on both professional and individual reviews I was interested in this film. From the beginning there's enough story to get you interested and enough mystery to keep you engaged in where it's going.I read warnings that suspension of disbelief would be needed so I came in with that mindset but this film needed a lot of suspension since some of the actions of the characters seemed just plain stupid. The characters Are written as intelligent people and given they established that, the characters should have been responding to their environment differently. After a while their behavior became almost farcical.The performances for the most part were good but I was left at the end wanting more from the story. Maybe there was more and they cut it so the film could fit the time they wanted?I'm not sorry I watched this film but I don't think I would watch it again, which for me is the test of great sci fi.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Mystical and Entertaining Watch.,"I came to watch Annihilation shortly after reading the book, and was left slightly disappointed as it follows its own trajectory, just for the book-lovers out there.
The film does leave a lot unanswered, which is why I think some people disliked it.As any good thriller film should go, everything is a mystery from the beginning, this elusive plot can either make or break your love for the film, all I'll say is go with it and don't try and pick holes in everything you see. The underlying tone of the film, in my opinion, is that there are things out there beyond our comprehension and comparing them to things we know on earth is illogical. The suspense never dissipates, and you're constantly craving to find out what will happen next, all the while slightly frightened at the prospect. 
Natalie Portman plays a brilliantly conflicted biologist who's main reason for joining the mission is to understand what happened to her husband in the same mission, but what she finds is unexpected. Having to depict a range of emotions, mainly confusion and sadness in a bewildering environment shows the steps people go through, trying to rationalise that which is impossible.At the end of the film, your questioning your sanity whilst trying to appreciate the alluring atmosphere the film provides.A thoroughly good watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Within First 30min You Will Be Clued Up To How Bad This Is,"Maybe like me you were fooled into watching this because you thought ""how bad can a move by director of Ex Machina can be?"" I am now learning that producers put this line on the cover when a movie is especially BAD.US movie makers have been going through a lot of forced changes since early 2016. A breed of reviewers calling themselves pop-critics wanted more women in movies just for sake of being a woman, not talent or skills. You know who they voted in 2016 US elections.This lack of good acting and talent cannot be more apparent from watching Natalie Portman's from very beginning of the movie. Why would anyone hire this bad actress beggars belief. Then she meets the director of the exploration team - a woman. And before the mission, she meets another 3 other female biologists (in a scene where I counted 7 women and 3 men). You cannot make this type of blatant discrimination up. Somehow you the viewer are being brainwashed to believe that these women will succeed where trained military and male scientists have failed! I now understand what was meant by ""where laws of nature don't apply anymore."" This movie is in same category as all-female Ghostbusters and latest Star Wars by JJ Abrams. It is about pushing an ideological agenda rather than a story.But let me go back to the beginning. The first few scenes of this movie is a right rip off of the great movie ""The Signal,"" a movie I thoroughly recommend you to watch to come out of the depression and coma that Annihilation will induce you into. I am giving this dull movie 1 out of 10 as it lacks all manner of credibility, passion, action and good acting. Get your money back.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

2018
Dir: Alex GarlandSynopsis: Basically you have a biologist (Natalie Portman) goes into a force field known as the shimmer. No one knows what it is or where it came from. A crew of scientists (all female) journey into the shimmer to see the cause and do research.Okay so this one was extreme. I'm not sure if I would consider this a perfect film (in my standards) but this is def one of the better ones I've seen so far this year. And I really really enjoyed it even though it's a bit of a slow burning flick. If I had to classify this one I would say somewhat of a cross between a horror/sci-fi and an art film. Sci-fi films like this you can't really tell from the trailer what it is based around but right from the rip you get a look at what is starting the conflict in he film. As the film progresses it uses the flashback point of interest theme, so as an example you'll get a scene where the characters will start a convo about something and the main character will have a flash back explaining the convo or subject. There are scenes and themes that are a bit disturbing so those with a weak stomach beware but then there are scenes that are elegant and beautiful. The added themes of horror and creature/monster give the thrill and suspense a nice touch. You think you know the ending until you get a quick twist in the last scene. Something to keep in mind is that it is a MIND BENDING film so even if you watch it twice you probably won't completely understand it. There are parts of the film that are essential and if you don't pay close attention or if your not a biologist you won't understand what is going on. Re watch? Definitely would. If your a fan of sci-fi or mind bending films it's really worth the watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Anni-bore-ation: A Tediously Unnatural Expedition,"Annihilation is one of the most underwhelming films I have ever encountered.It was recommended by Netflix for having a well-crafted script mixed with acclaimed shows like Breaking Bad, Ozark, and Dark; I approached Annihilation with high hopes. However, my expectations were shattered as the film unfolded, descending further into a pit of boredom with each passing minute.One aspect that became immediately apparent was the low-budget nature of the production. While I can appreciate a film's creativity and resourcefulness even with limited funds, Annihilation's special effects fell disappointingly short. The CGI was lackluster, akin to the quality found in low-budget productions from the '90s. I assume it was low-budget, if not, that's even worse.Annihilation suffers from an agonisingly slow pace and an inadequately constructed plot. Very little actually transpires throughout the film, and what little does occur is poorly woven together. As a result, the characters lack depth, making it impossible to gauge the talents of the leading female actresses. Even the most skilled performers would struggle to salvage the film's lifeless script and subpar cinematography. This deficiency is further exacerbated by the woefully unconvincing CGI, creating a disheartening backdrop that fails to immerse viewers.In short, Annihilation is a sluggish, uninteresting, and poorly executed film. Its flaws become increasingly pronounced as the story unfolds, reminiscent of a car struggling to shift into a lower gear. The initially promising storyline deteriorates, leaving audiences yearning for any semblance of excitement or substance, which never materializes.I cannot, in good conscience, recommend Annihilation. It falls woefully short of its initial potential, leaving viewers with a profound sense of disappointment. I can't even rate it as one of those low-budget sci-fis that are so bad they are funny, it's just bad.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Low Reviews here exposes the extent of pseudo sci fi aficionados,"The low-star reviews shows how many people either have no imagination, no basic science intelligence, and/or just too damn dense to understand a good, rudimentary sci fi movie like this one.If you really ""get"" sci fi, you will enjoy this one.
Panspermia is the plot drive, and although slower paced than an eye candy movie like Star Wars, it still captivates.My only criticism is the title. ""Annihilation"" implies everything gets destroyed, when it doesn't - ""morphing"" is what happens.",,Anonymous,Horror
Masterpiece in cinematography held back by flawed dialogue and pacing,"Annihilation is a mixed bag when it comes to its execution of a tricky plot crammed into 2h 20m with lots of fluff and awkward pacing that leaves much to be desired. It struggles to find its tone and direction - being both a sci-fi adventure with an existential lens and a cosmic horror that loses its way towards the rushed and patchwork ending.The visual approach, framing and direction is all exceptional. The use of setting, composition and lighting is masterful and the consistency of the cinematography is fantastic. The sound design is also fantastic - especially towards the climax, it is a truly unique sound that enhances the films. This is why it is so disappointing to see it constantly broken by clunky dialogue that is unnecessary and uses up much needed time to fit the broad story into a film-sized runtime. The subplot of lena's relationship is left unexplored and empty - it is confusing for the audience and much more time could be spent on it if so much wasn't dedicated to awkward exchanges between characters that fails to build the tension expected of horror film dialogue.Finally, the films mediocrity is summed up in its climax, inconsistent CGI harms a visually fantastic ending and Natalie Portman's performance really punches above its weight to carry this sequence. The climax lacks the emotional weight it deserves because the pacing throughout is so stop-start and jumps from moment to moment losing all tension and becoming confusing, the film also loses all notions of horror it struggled to maintain.Ultimately, annihilation is at its best as a visual treat and horror experience and struggles to keep up in other areas.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Annihilates your brain,"This review of Annihilation is spoiler free***** (5/5)IF YOU EVER need a well-drawn, super-smart and thought provoking sci-fi (and in this world of identikit sequels, remakes and films we've seen done before we definitely do) a film that will take you on a ride of mystery, the paranormal and take you to a whole new world, then writer-director Alex Garland is your man. Though this isn't the first time he's taken you down this road, his brilliant Oscar-winning debut Ex Machina did pretty much the same thing, which had him take us on a winding road through super-smart thrills involving robots basically it was his vision of A.I. Now, we get his visitation of an alien world. Annihilation is Garland's version of Avatar, and in it he makes true to the different sci-fi tropes while still making it feel solidly original.First off it sets itself as a women-on-a-mission story - a five strong team of scientists each of them with very different skill sets (there's a biologist, a physicist, a geologist, a paramedic and a psychologist) they are sent on a secret, potentially dangerous mission to a crashed meteor site causing different changes in an area of Florida. But that's just the throwaway plotting, as throughout Garland (loosely adapting the best selling novel by Jeff VanderMeer) in it he tackles routes of grief, depression, loneliness and insanity. And with it he's created a story that could change the routes of typical sci-fi. Natalie Portman is Lena - a cellular biologist who suffers from grief after the mysterious disappearance of her husband (Isaac), she also suffers from solidarity and she always feels that her world is not going to be the same again. Normally it would be difficult to find an actress who can portray this kind of personality with such strength, such sadness and such feeling that can make you feel for her, and it looks like Garland has found his true calling in Portman. Of course you have to praise her co-stars too, who each take their roles (with Garland's magnificent guidance) and they each play them beautifully. There's Jennifer Jason Leigh as a sort of general type in charge of their mission, secondly there's Tessa Thompson who's another world beyond the strong warrioress in Thor: Ragnarok etc. And each of them bring the story to the ground. 
 
With that it helps that Garland and his visionary creative team make this world feel as authentic as possible, once through the shimmering purple shield like material it's almost as if Garland has placed our heroines on another planet, a world where evolution has escalated to 11, the animals have changed their features, tree like vines grow on buildings, there are different colours of flowers in the same batch. In short it's a world where nature has no rules, a place where time and space are irrelevant. At the same time Garland gives the audience the big questions; what happens in this place? Is it dangerous? What happens to people in the world? etc. The mysteries are relentlessly unfolded. Here Garland has conjured a world that's beautiful and will have you in constant awe. To be fair, it's best if you just go with it as the film drags you in.Garland was late coming to the director's route; Annihilation is only his second film yet it feels he's been directing for his entire life, but he hasn't been, he started out as a novelist (he wrote the novel to The Beach), later he turned screenwriter going on to write film's such as 28 Days Later and Sunshine to name a couple - this was all years before he took the plunge to write and direct his exceptional debut which was only three years ago. Whatever made him take his time to make these two films it's all been worth it, this is worthy follow-up to Garland's directing career essentially proving that his debut was no joyous accident one that soon saw him become a recognizable figure. And we can't wait to see what he does next.
 
VERDICT Asks questions of mystery but then unravels into something deeper, a film that have you stunned with awe. This is sci-fi at its best.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Promising start, frantic middle and muddled ending","Annihilation was always going to be an ambitious task, adapting Jeff VanderMeer's defining novel into a suitable cinematic experience. On initial viewing, you think this has been accomplished: swathes of exotic environments, bright colours and curious organisms fill the scenes, providing a surreal but ominous backdrop for Lena (Natalie Portman) and her expedition. Some of the graphic effects are amazing, fully conveying their intended dread. However, as the story progresses, this magic begins to be lost - only so much CGI can be used before becoming oversaturated, a gamble which this film decides to risk.In terms of acting, the all-star cast (Portman, Oscar Isaac, Tessa Thompson) all lend their own devices to building suspense and mystery, with Portman being given the bulk of the difficult material. This becomes difficult to appreciate, however, after the plot begins to give way to gratuitous violence and fight scenes. Soon after, the story seems to fall apart completely, culminating an an ending that is as dissatisfying as it is nonsensical. Annihilation is worth watching purely to give credit to the visual effects on show, not to mention if you are partial to a sci-fi flick. Beyond this, however, a shallow plot prevents this film from really separating itself from mediocrity.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""Many theories, few facts""... another sci-fi from Alex Garmand","""Annihilation"" (2018 release; 115 min.) brings the story of Lena. As the movie opens, Lena is being debriefed upon her return of a trip, the sole survivor of an expedition to figure out what is going on in ""Area X"". We then go back in time: we witness something from outer space hitting a lighthouse (but we don't know what exactly), and then Lena's husband Kane returns home after having been away for 12 months on a covert mission and Lena thinking he had died. Kane is clearly very sick, and when Lena takes him to the hospital, government forces intercept the ambulance and the are both taken to a compound called the Southern Reach... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer-director Alex Garland, who previously brought us the excellent sci-fi ""Ex Machina"". Here Garland does another sci-fi project (working from Jeff VanderMeer's novel of the same name). It's quite mysterious as to what exactly is happening. When Lena tries to extract some basic facts from the doctor-psychologist, she simply tells Lena ""Many theories, few facts"", and that will have to do it. The first half of the movie muddles along, and it isn't until we reach the second half that things really take off, as we start to understand what is really unfolding. There are some terrific (and terrifying) scenes in that second half that will have you holding on to your seat... (I shan't say more). Natalie Portman is wonderful as Lena. Oscar Isaac seems bewildered as her husband Kane. Jennifer Jason Leigh is almost unrecognizable as the doctor-psychologist. The movie's photography is a bit heavy on CGI special effects. Last but certainly not least, there is a spectacular original score, courtesy of composers Portishead's Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury (they also scored ""Ex Machina"") that I plan on seeking out.""Annihilation"" opened this weekend, and I was looking forward to catching it. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was not attended well (less than 10 people in huge theater), and I can't say that it surprised me as it seems the movie is struggling to create an identity while also trying to escape the attention-grabbing blockbuster ""Black Panther"". Nevertheless, while it is not quite as exquisite as ""Ex Machina"", I found it worthwhile, and I'd recommend you seek it out, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Jumping on the bandwagon of contemporary intellectual science-fiction cinema,"Annihilation is a calm, intellectual and surreal science-fiction film in the key of recent successes such as Arrival, Ex Machina or even Blade Runner 2049 to a certain degree. Based upon a recent novel by Jeff VanderMeer, it tells the story of a mysterious and expanding extraterrestrial entity known as The Shimmer that seems to transform, mutate and copy its natural environment. Several groups have gone inside The Shimmer to investigate the phenomenon but none of them have come back as all of them were apparently killed, killed one another or went crazy and got lost. One year after his disappearance, a soldier named Kane suddenly comes back home to his wife Lena. Kane doesn't seem to be himself however. He is emotionally distant, seems to suffer from dementia and suddenly starts to feel very sick. On his way to the hospital, a government security force intercepts the ambulance and brings Kane and Lena to a secret area near The Shimmer. The security force wishes to interrogate Kane but he is in a coma. The security force then decides to send one last group into The Shimmer, consisting of a worried Lena who is a biologist and has been working for the military for seven years, an obsessed and strict psychologist named Doctor Ventress, a physicist with borderline personality disorder named Josie, an alcoholic paramedic called Anya who has anger management issues and surveyor and geologist Cass who mourns the death of her daughter who died of leukemia. The five women set out on a suicide mission as they soon lose track of time and realize how the mysterious entity not only transforms their environment but also themselves mentally and physically. In a last ditch effort, the group attempts to find out the secret of the entity and annihilate it before it annihilates them.There are several elements that make Annihilation a worthwhile experience. First of all, the film has a constant gloomy and mysterious atmosphere from start to finish. Secondly, the movie has an intellectual plot that makes the viewers speculate until the very end and beyond. Thirdly, the five female lead characters are very interesting in their own ways and their inner demons only add to the menacing tone of the movie. Fourthly, the overall calm film is occasionally shook up by a few sudden battles and gory scenes that never feel forced because they tell us more about the strange entity and the fate of the lost groups. Fifthly and maybe most importantly, the film is visually stunning. The animations, colors and light techniques make the extraterrestrial entity very spectacular and especially the film's climax is an unforgettable dream-like experience. Finally, the film's ending is quite controversial as some people might praise it while others could despise it. It's definitely something worth discussing. You should watch this film if you have an open mind for an intellectual experience. If you are just seeking passive entertainment, this movie is definitely not for you.Annihilation also has a few negative elements of course. In my opinion, it's much too close to movies such as Arrival and seems to jump on the bandwagon. This might also be the reason why I happened to find the movie's twist quite predictable which lowered its intensity quite a bit. Even though I'm aware that this is fiction, I disliked the fact that five characters that would never be chosen for this type of mission in real life got teamed up together. Some of them, like the extremely selfish psychologist that would clearly need a psychologist herself or the overtly aggressive paramedic who is a danger to herself and anyone around her, feel sketchily exaggerated, even given the circumstances that the extraterrestrial entity has an impact on the characters' psyches. Some more subtleness regarding the characters would have suited the movie's tone better.In the end, you might appreciate Annihilation even more if you haven't watched movies such as Arrival and Ex Machina before because it would be your first impressive contact with this type of intellectual science-fiction movie. If you have watched those two movies and others of its kind before, you will probably realize that Annihilation is inferior to those films and simply a good intellectual science-fiction movie. The visual components and the intellectual story are still good enough to watch this movie at your local cinema but the film's impact isn't as big as I would have expected beforehand.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not a great movie,"I was aware of this movie and declined viewing it upon my impression of it but I watched it upon the emphatic recommendation of a friend. After viewing I wish I had stuck with my initial impression. I guess the thing that stood out to me most considering the positive attention paid to it was the cheap, almost low budget shot-on-video look. Like soap opera quality. And in my opinion the excessive and constant computer-generated effects only exacerbate the problem. It makes it hard to become immersed in or really care about the characters or what's going on. The writing doesn't help in this regard. Some of the acting is good though and the premise is interesting. However the plot progresses in a melodramatic fashion and the writing is fairly poor. Not a total loss but hard to recommend. Just kind of a dumb movie overall.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Weird fiction, indeed","I read the book, first in a trilogy, before I watched the film and in that review I bet that the movie will be better than the book, which I found pretentious and opaque. Well, I can't say if I won or lost that bet. The movie is certainly different, with many ingredients added and a lot of them removed. I thought that the acting was OK and that the visuals were very good. The only issue I had was with the story, which only ponders on things, without actually explaining or expanding on any of them. That is not a bad thing, pondering, but I guess I had to be in the mood to understand the intent of the writer/director in adapting a book that I equally didn't understand. Perhaps my knowledge of programming and AI made me like Ex Machina a lot because I understood both people and non-people in it. In Annihilation I didn't get either.To paraphrase the character in the film, Alex Garland didn't intend to destroy the story with this film, he just wanted to change it. I don't know into what and I don't feel he even knew I was there. Of course, that may be all me.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
It melted my brain in the best way possible,"I dont think its possible to describe the final 30 minutes of Annihilation and do it justice, which is the best compliment i can give it. As a piece of visual storytelling, Annihilation blows it out of the water. Garland's latest work pushes the boundaries of mainstream cinema by offering a film that is so unapologetic in its vision, you cant help but applaud. Not since Arrival (2016) has a film captured my attention so completely and left me so consistently in awe.I mean what else can i say without spoiling it. The performances are great. The female representation is fantastic. The visual effects and design should get nominated if not outright win. If you love sci fi, then you need to watch this immediately on the largest screen you can find. This is a wholly original piece of work, that will likely draw wildly different opinions and interpretations.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

I absolutely loved it and was pleasantly surprised to find that this was about the creepiest, (and the trippiest) get under your skin movie I have ever seen.

it's not going to be for everyone,"Be honest, everybody is talking about this weird sci-fi flick. And once it came out it was available on Netflix so the whole world could watch this. And so I did and was it worth the hype.Welll, those who can dig arty flicks it's one for them. It's slow-paced and it doesn't have some action to make it an action flick. On the other hand, being a sci-fi even that is so weird because the shimmer is in fact the rare thing that is on earth. What it does is explained all over the flick and for some the explanation can be to hard to understand. But it's also filed under horror.On that part I can agree on so many ways. It's never scary and you can see it coming when the creepy parts are there but the effects used for the horror are really top-notch gore. Being a rather gory flick makes it not watcghable for the squeamish.If you can stand a slow-paced flick with a weird story and nice effects overruled sometimes by pure gore it's surely is one to stream on youtr Netflix account.The gore did it for me and the effects but being so slow is what takes it a bit down on my rating.Gore 3/5

Annihilation of a Decent Idea,"A meteorite strikes a lighthouse on the southeastern US coast and a mysterious 'Shimmer Zone' begins expanding from the impact point. The government keeps the event a secret and sends military units into the area, but none of these personnel ever return. One of them, the special forces husband of an ex-Army biologist called Lena, suddenly shows up at their home after a year's absence, about which he has little recollection and immediately falls seriously ill.After this 15 minute prologue, Lena joins the next all-female expedition. The five women enter the zone, discover their communications devices no longer work and witness some disturbing events. Rather than return to base and report these discoveries, they push on, arguing among themselves and making foolish decisions like a bunch of dim-witted teenagers in a slasher pic. The military and scientific background becomes increasingly unbelievable as action sequences and some uninspired CGI overwhelm the film's grown-up possibilities.Many sci-fi fans will recall JG Ballard conceived the original idea of an expanding zone where the laws of nature are transformed and human psychology reconstructed. Compared to Ballard's 1966 novel 'The Crystal World', Garland's movie version of Jeff VanderMeer's copycat concept is an ordinary adventure yarn spiced up with some mumbo-jumbo. 'Annihilation' ends up as inconsequential as Garland's 2007 'Sunshine' screenplay - and after 'Ex Machina', it's a major disappointment.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Good attempt, but ultimately trying to be too smart","Annihilation is quite a fine sci-fi flick. The pacing is good, the atmosphere is there and the storyline is interesting. The performances are pretty spot on. Jennifer Jason Leigh and Natalie Portman are good and Gina Rodriguez great.
But as many sci-fi flicks it tries to be too smart. It tries to be like ""The Matrix"" (1999) but it just isn't. It leaves more questions than answers them. Ultimately this and the horrible special effects are what lets the movie down.Some interesting stuff, but overall pretty forgettable: 6/10",,Anonymous,Horror

"Creative and Mesmerizing, but Flawed","After first watching it, I didn't quite know what to think of Annihilation, Alex Garland's follow-up to Ex Machina. On one hand, the combination of hypnotic visuals, original science fiction concepts, and effective horror sequences, as well as the refreshingly weird and unconventional story drew me in. On the other hand, the bland exposition scenes, forced dialogue, unconvincing CG and inconsistent performances prevented me from loving this movie. The first act definitely drags but I absolutely loved the ending. The last 20 minutes or so were definitely the highlight of the film for me. Overall, I would definitely recommend Annihilation. Despite its flaws, it's still one of the more unique science fiction films in recent years and I'm glad it's developed a following in the time since its release.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Annihilates The Mundane, but Still Needs Some Editing","The Science Fiction genre, a group of films that often get wrapped up in other genres that they stray far from the roots established long ago. A true science fiction, is often a thriller that tests the limits of reality, dives deep into the psyche of the characters, and often brings a fictitious world that we can only dream of to life. And this weekend, another movie looks to fall into this category and actually belong into it. Annihilation starring Natalie Portman looks to be a movie that contains many strange elements, wonders, and thrills to warrant a venture into the movie theater again. What lies in store? Well Robbie K would be happy to share his thoughts with another review. Let's get started!LIKES:The World Building: Within Annihilation, lies the anomaly called the Shimmer and within it a world that has been mutated by some unknown force. As our ""heroes"" for lack of a better word venture into the gasoline mixed with water looking border, the world contained within is a wonder in itself. Our world's natural flora and fauna are bizarrely twisted into these contorted visuals that look natural, beautiful, and a true representation of the genetic crossing that we all studied in school. The world's scientific art continued to grow only deeper and darker as they traveled further into the void, the animation and creativity being unleashed into the chaotic skew with no limitations. Some of these creations are stunning in terms of color, while other times they are the things of nightmares, whose movements and designs will leave you huddled in your chair.Science Fiction Thrills: In addition to the world itself, Annihilation is all about the true Sci-Fi adventure. An unending suspense hovers over the air, the tension always mounting at what lies within the glades of this weird dimension. The mystery of what is causing this continues to build across the course of the movie, as well as if our heroes will make it to find the answer. Annihilation's threats do exist outside, but even more dire is the psychological warfare the Shimmer plays on our girls. Disturbing imagery is only one assault to their psyches, as they are pushed from all fronts to confront whatever it is eating them inside. And in addition to bringing suspense, the characters get some major development, shelling out their background information and helping them adapt to the ever-changing world around them. This culmination is very entertaining and truly worthy of the sci-fi mantle in terms of plot.Deep: A good science fiction movie makes you think, and Annihilation has got you covered in this element as well. As you try to solve the mystery of the movie and the fantastic twists that get thrown in, you'll find deeper meanings behind the actions of the movie. Many of these are head scratchers, trying to figure out just what the Shimmer is doing. While not as complex as Arrival or Matrix, Annihilation still has plenty of tricks up its sleeve to bend your mind and get you trying to process all the weird information it throws at you. As you process this, you may uncover deeper, morale dilemmas, horror filled thoughts of the future, and even the fragility of order are all up for questions. This artistic flare is certainly a score booster, though fair warning that these deeper meanings are also disturbing at times too.DISLIKES:Savage/Disturbing: With a title like Annihilation, one needs to be ready for darker undertones and source material. However, this movie goes down a very graphic path that was able to penetrate my desensitized shell. Found footage reveals some rather violent outcomes for previous teams, with little to no censorship of details that are capable of causing some to lose their lunch. The savage nature of the beasts and the violence held within just about everything in this film throws no punches, again choosing to display the gory details that fail to dampen.Flashbacks: The flashbacks are certainly for character development and some of them set the story up nicely for the bombs to be dropped. Others however, are unnecessary details that did little other than show the suffering we already knew she held and expand the run time. Complete as it was, I didn't quite pick up on the significance of some of these wasted scenes and could have held better storytelling elements to help build the suspense. Not all of these have to be eliminated, but editing could have used some tightening up to make everything more relevant.Deeper supporting characters: The movie is primarily about Natalie Portman, shocker there, and at the start it showed some promise that the other members of her team would be more integral to the mission. Yet, things decrease fairly fast to where the other characters soon become rushed plot lines, trinkets to tax Leah (Portman)'s conscience and further push the psyche limitations of everyone. Had they given some better relationships, a little more teamwork, and integration of all characters, perhaps then we would have had even stronger development and thrills to enjoy.The Weird Ending: You know that feeling you get when after the big wait the ending turns out to be something you didn't/or maybe never wanted to expect? Well Annihilation was kind of like that for me. The twist at the end was great, bringing relevance to some of the flashbacks, and really blowing your mind. However, the entity itself is not quite as awe-inspiring or terrifying to say the least. The source of the trouble is abstract, creepy, and very hard on the ears as it tries to communicate in sounds you have heard in the trailers. This final scene is super prolonged, and quite uncomfortable at times to watch as this dance of perverted awkwardness commences. Is it unique? Yes, but it still didn't quite match what I wanted. And for those who don't like abstract thinking and deciphering the conclusion yourself, hate to break it to you, but you won't get all the explanations you might be looking for. Yeah, it's weird.The VERDICT:Annihilation may have looked weird, and it's true it is an odd spectacle to behold to the general audience. However, it is a true sci fi thriller in meaning, thought provoking, stunts, and world building, to the level that fans of the genre will be pleased with what the studio brought out to you. It's weaknesses for me come in it went a little too far down the weird pathway, going too savage and abstract to provide a clear picture at times. The use of flashbacks was stylish at times but overdone as it sacrificed the chances for other characters to get some more time on the screen. Still, if you are looking for that dark, story that makes you scratch your head, then Annihilation is the movie for you to check out. For those who qualify, this movie is worth a trip to the theater, but for others kip this as long as you can to avoid disturbing those with sensitive constitutions.My scores are:

I got a few things to say.,"Watch this movie. Yeah, just watch it. I've seen it a bunch of times. Could I tell you what it meant? Probably not. Have I thought about it more than any other movie, really? Probably.I think this movie has something to do with life, and cancer, self harm, maybe love. It doesn't really overtly tell you it means any of these things. But I think the interpretation aspect makes it memorable, and consequently, thoughtful.The end does, in my opinion, stretch the limits of the movie's focus. Maybe it blurs the lines that might've been helpful to walk away with something tangible, or structured in thought.

An intensely-beautiful film.,"... it's a Sci-Fi movie, and a Love Story and an Existential Drama and probably several other genres.It's quite horrifying in parts and has one of the most horrific ideas ever committed to film (yes, I'm looking at you, ScreamBear). Despite that, it's also frequently-beautiful and at times it's even meditative.Like a lot of classic films, it can't be pinned down and placed in any one category. It stands up to multiple viewings and reveals something new each time. As to what it's ""about"" - that depends on what you see each time you watch it.It's visually-stunning, shot through with intrigue and tension, and features a heart-breaking story of the most human regret in the midst of a pitiless, amoral scientific phenomenon.It leaves you with a lot to think about. So you watch it again to figure it out and that leaves you with even more to think about.

delicious Lovecraftian sci-fi horror,"Love love LOVE, one of my absolute favorite horror movies of all time (all very subjective of course).""Annihilation"" is a sci-fi horror film with an almost entirely all-female main cast (the absolute girlbossery of it all), that delivers on its premise and goes above and beyond. I personally like to categorize it as cosmic horror, and there is certainly something Lovecraftian about the Shimmer and its sinister touch. The visuals are as stunning as they are creative, and doudbly haunting. There aren't that many jumpscares in the movie and frankly it may not be the most terrifying piece of media you've ever consumed, but it doesn't really matter since its main appeal lies elsewhere - namely, the absolute irrational, animal fear of the incomprehensible power of the cosmos that it instills in its viewers. The movie is chock full of symbolism that gets absolutely unreadable without a PhD in quantum physics by the end, but frankly I don't care, objectivism has never been my strong suit anyway.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

When i think about it this movie will be the imagination of a 10 years old child if you asked them to write a scary story. Even the acting was terrible. In the first segment of the movie it's as if the actors were doing everything slowly in an attempt to mimic suspense.

Twin Peaks light,"The film has a very high Twin Peaks feel in vagueness, although it's less mysterious and quicker into the action, the mystique and the whole story.

A modern Stalker,"Who wants to see a down to earth Sci Fi movie in a traditional sense is wrong here.This movie is a reminiscent of the movie ""Stalker"" where a group of men goes into a mysterious forbidden zone to find a room where wishes get granted.Here we have a group of women who venture into a mysterious zone, and they are looking for a lighthouse, and every one has their own individual wishes, problems and motives. But the journey here is also more a test of the mind then anything else. So in conclusion the movie deals more with psychological issues about identity, changes, and self destruction tendencies than with action scenes and survival.On the surface it may look like a traditional Sci Fi movie, but like Stalker or Odyssee 2001 it has a lot of layers that are open to the interpreation of the viewer.For Example: You could see it as a metaphor of the relationship of Lena and Kane that was tested by a an affair. And while Kane (in a psychological way) was broken and changed and turned into a differnet person after this affair, Lena stayed in her identity but had a hard fight with herself. But this is just one possible interpreation of one layer of the movie and it may be totally far-fetched. But I believe this movie wants to be open for different views and interpreations, without tellling you what is right or wrong.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Annihilation,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerAfter seeing the trailer, I was thoroughly intrigued and had to see this film. After watching the movie, I was utterly confused at what I had just seen. When I got home I looked up an explanation video on YouTube and it helped clear things us immensely.The story is very complex and detailed orientated which makes it hard to follow. The sci-fi and mystery part of the film is great. The horror aspect of the movie is nonexistent because it is not very scary. The build up to the ending is the best part of the film. The ending is weird and very strange to say the least. I personally believe that this film has a lot of personal interpretation to it. The ending can mean what you want it to mean. The science aspect of the film is also a high point of the film.The acting is very good. Natalie Portman delivers a stunning performance as a woman in search of redemption, answers, and finding her true love. Oscar Isaac, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Tuva Novotny, Tessa Thompson, and Benedict Wong all perform very well. Gina Rodriguez performs the worst. She is a cliché female side character who thinks she is badass and tough. She is painfully annoying and I was happy when she died.The pacing is great. The film slowly builds up the tense and the story. The runtime is a little overlong.Pros: Complex and interesting story, good combination of sci-fi and mystery, the building up for the ending was great, Natalie Portman's performance, good overall acting, and good pacingCons: A somewhat too complex story, weird ending, Gina Rodriguez and her terrible performance, and an overlong runtimeOverall Rating: 7.8P.S.

Ponderous sci-fi,"Annihilation is another existential sci-fi asking big (largely unanswered) questions about humanity's destiny on this planet. Unlike Arrival and BladeRunner however Garland mixes in more typical blockbuster action and traditional thrills and jumps along the way. That said Annihilation doesn't build tension as you'd expect, despite similar set-plays to Jurassic Park, Predator etc. Whilst the premise is interesting enough, as with Ex-Machina Garland is too preoccupied with the film's ""big message"" delivering under-involving characters and a vague marginally dissatisfying pay off. I couldn't escape the feeling annihilation was too much like a longer, very well produced (and expensive) episode of Black Mirror.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Ambitions & Disappointments,"Just to clarify: This movie isn't pseudo-philosophical. It has actually a deeper meaning and subtext. Still, it's not really fleshed out that well. But let's get the positive stuff out of the way: The art-design (especially for certain creatures) is great. As well as MOST of the effects. Yeah, the CGI was pretty noticable in some scenes, and the texturierung gets out of hand, on some of the environment. Still, for the most part they look really convincing. The ""score"" of the movie, and the sound design in general are handled very expertially. Towards the end, some of the sound-effects really freaked me out. In a positive way. The story, or more so the concept of the movie remains it's strongest point. It deals with theoretical depictions of life from outer space and simultaneously describes a relationship between our protagonist, Lena, and her husband. Certain plotpoints of both narratives cross over in a very clever way. And also it contains the character arc for Lena, so the story doesn't lose itself in its science ""mumbo jumbo"", like one other review here claimed. The ending of the movie was absolutely great and very ambitious. Personally, i liked it very much. So, now to the negative stuff: The story has an uneven structure. The main plotline gets constantly disrupted by flash-forwards to the aftermath-interrogation of our main protagonist. Also the whole narrative has a weak beginning. They could have started the movie, when the main characters are already in ""the shimmer"", and THEN incorporated some flashbacks. Also there are various plot holes and inconsistencies sprinkled throughout the movie. Still, i will defend that point: All characters have a reason to be in this film. Their actions and fates have a metaphorical meaning. Also this flick creates great atmosphere! Almost like a well-made horror movie, especially in the end. Kind of Ex machina. All in all, it was a interesting movie-going experience for me and i recommend Annihilation to everyone. Those high-concept Sci Fi-movies should get made more often. Just stay open minded and do not expect a scientifically accurate story.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Misunderstood. Beautiful. Intimate.,"This film has created an awful lot of confusion here. There is no arguing that the film is a masterpiece. I think where the confusion lies is in the nature of the film. It is not strictly a sci-fi despite having been sold as such. The film uses sci-fi and horror to tell an intimate, human story of change and growth through allegory. If you do not like films that explore metaphysics or philosophical questions through allegory (the fountain, black swan, 2001) then you may very well dislike or misinterpret this film. The people here identifying 'logical' holes in the film have completely missed what the film is doing. Any focus on realism here is moot. The practicalities are irrelevant. This is a classical use of tropes to test and examine motivations along the lines of Samuel Beckett etc. This is not classical sci-fi and if you are not prepared to let go of your relationship with typical films and probe the human questions being presented then you'll at the very least miss the intention of the film. Even if you don't want to examine the film's message, just let go of your preconceptions and rules and enjoy what is a beautiful film.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
WHATCH THIS! (its not as complicated as you think),"I read the reviews for this movie and.. i dont get the fuss. I was half expecting some wierd, incomprehensible indie movie, but no. Really no. Its a fairly straightforward scifi, mystery thriller, it makes me think of Sphere (1998). Also its influenced by Lovecrafts novel ""colour from out of space"" quite a lot it seems.So watch it. You probably enjoy it. Dont get frightend by the reviews. Not the bad ones from people claiming to have fallen asleep, nor the good ones celebrating this movie as some kind of epic, complex masterpiece. Its solid entertainment, and the bigger the screen you watch it on, the better, visuals are damn good.Sidenote; all five of the female lead characters have quite solid, intresting personalities whitch grow and develops during the movie.

Processing Grief,"To begin with, Annihilation is a visually stunning film with vibrant colors and glistening lights, which lends itself to the eeriness of this sci-fi/horror/thriller movie. After all, how could a movie this bright and beautiful be scary?But the real horror of Annihilation, its central thesis, is the pervasiveness and destructiveness of grief, a feeling that permeates through every other aspect of your life, replacing the normal parts with something that looks similar, but is fundamentally different. Left unchecked, grief then consumes you, replacing the life you once had with an echo of its former vibrance.How then are you able to fight back, to stem the tide of grief's advancing aura? You investigate its root cause, its origin. You venture into the swamp of lingering memory and regret, and it either destroys you or you destroy it.Each character approaches their grief differently, but all attempting to reach the same center. Much like the root cause of her grief (the loss of her daughter to leukemia), Cass represents the uncontrollability of your circumstances, the futility of fighting against fate or destiny or nature. As she says of her attempts to study the Shimmer, it's like ""using confetti to test a hurricane.""Anya represents rage, an unbridled anger targeting the lack of trust that can come from grief, the inability to distinguish what is true from what is fiction. As a former addict, there is an element of an inner world calmed by external substances or forces. But when that calmness fades, when her perception of the world deteriorates, she lashes out with violence.On the other hand, Josie represents a certain kind of understanding and acceptance of grief. As it begins to consume her, she recognizes the changes. But unlike Ventress (who wants to reach the center), Josie's reaction is to follow her path to its inevitable conclusion. As she tells Lena, ""Ventress wants to face it. You want to fight. But I don't think I want either of those things."" It's a fatalism that doesn't necessarily mean she truly understands her situation, but she's made peace with its ending regardless.Ventress's way of making peace is to face grief head on. She embraces the inevitability of her situation, but she wants to explore its cause, to understand the how and the why, even if those answers don't make a difference. And that focus and determination helps her reach her goal in the end-an answer without a change.Lastly, the movie starts and ends with Lena, who is dealing with grief directly. For the other characters, grief is offscreen, mentioned only to add color to their personal histories. But for Lena, we see it in the opening scenes. It is her drive-as she mentions, she's the only one with a reason to come back from their expedition. And like a true scientist, she observes and learns from the other characters, accepting at times futility, rage, acceptance, and peace. It allows her to discover the center, the source of the annihilation, understand it, and overcome it.As an allegory for grief, Annihilation is more a modern retelling of Orpheus and Eurydice than it is an alien invasion movie. And much like Orpheus, Lena doesn't return with her husband, Kane. Instead, she returns with something else entirely, a recreation of her past that is a processed and anthropomorphized form grief. It's no longer Kane, but rather an echo of Kane, an echo that Lena can both understand and live with as she herself has been changed in the grieving process.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Inspired, beautiful, unintelligible","From a conceptual standpoint, Annihilation is a near masterpiece. Even if the story is vague and extremely hard to actually understand, the conceptual elements and the well thought-out pacing create a highly immersive cinematic experience.Its visual appearance also helps convey the appropriate atmosphere. The defocused overgrown worlds, the refractions subtly placed everywhere in the frame, the blown out highlights and the meticulous composition all create a both unique and appealing look.The visual effects work is out of the ordinary as well. The attention is clearly not in photorealism, but the environments are stylized to fit the concept. And yet, when necessary, the teams did their best to bring to life some of the most freaky and appalling hyperreal creatures in cinema.The only problem here is the production. A low budget and bad advertising, combined with the elusive script, resulted in an apparently serious flop. It's great to see that at least the filmmakers' vision wasn't interrupted and the concept was brought to life intact, but the hard truth is that if good movies are to keep getting created, they need to bring the producers the necessary monetary profit.Overall - a great movie, worthy of a rewatch.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Disappointing,"The ideas presented in this movie are interesting, which probably led to my strong feeling of disappointment in how they were presented - it could have been SO good! The first half of the movie was compelling and I was feeling / hoping that it would leave me feeling how I did when I left the theatre after Arrival - questioning, marvelling, wanting to see and absorb it again. The second half of Annihilation sadly fell completely apart. There were too many distracting plot holes, too much grazing over important details, and way too much pretentiousness. Cue the loud, weird soundtrack at the end, and we'll have a smart, artsy movie! Meh. It was a mediocore flick pretending to be a smart masterpiece. 
Is it worth seeing? A renter for sure, but save yourself the money and avoid it in the theatre.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Appropriately Tense and Scary but Not the Complete Package for Me,"The thing that caught my attention with the Annihilation trailers was the unique visual design the movie had. Dark and moody sci-fi set on Earth rarely has such a vibrant colour scheme. One of the best parts of Annihilation is that it does do something unique with the visual effects and the environments. The creatures within the Shimmer are frightening combinations like if you got to do a Build-a-Bear with monstrous, human-killing animals. You have this alien life that populates the screen with bright colours, but they manage to make it look sickly and scary even. This was an element I needed, with the slow pace of the movie it kept me engaged.So Lena is our protagonist who ventures into the Shimmer with her team to discover the origin and the threat level of what lies within. Lena (Natalie Portman), Kane (Oscar Isaac) and the team are all given compelling backstories, but I think I ended up liking the actors and actresses more than the characters. Lena isn't particularly interesting or easy to care about. She's very detached (that's by design) and her lack of emotion wasn't endearing, especially when we find out more about her. Its the same with the other characters, the actors and actresses have to do the work to get you invested instead of the writing. The only one who gets continued development other than Lena or Kane is Dr. Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and she's also deliberately cold. The rest of the team gets the initial character motivation description and the movie just moves on.The other reason I wanted to see Annihilation (other than Garland's name being attached and the good reviews) was that the movie featured a lot of people I like in the cast. I think Natalie Portman did about as good of a job as she could have, I liked her just not her character. Oscar Isaac did a fine job, I wondered why he signed on to this, he gets some solid screen time, but he isn't given a chance to do much. It was nice to see Gina Rodriguez again, she's the most emotional of the team but her reactions help sell the horror of the situation. I was a little disappointed Tessa Thompson wasn't given more to do. She's been really stepping out lately in stuff like: Thor Ragnarok and Westworld and while she does her job, I wish she also had more to work with. Jennifer Jason Leigh does well as Dr. Ventress and Tuva Novotny might have been my favourite doing an even-keeled job as Cass Shepherd.A lot of great science fiction isn't concerned about moving at a brisk pace. That's not a bad thing always, there's a lot of buildup in this movie and there were some quick moments that showed how horrible the Shimmer was. So, waiting for the payoff at the end didn't bother me. The problem I had with Annihilation was the ending doesn't have the punch I wanted. There's so much tension and when we finally get there... I thought it just fizzled out. I think the intention was for you to be a little more attached to the relationship between Lena and Kane but the flashbacks showing them was the weakest part of the movie. I haven't read the book, but I wouldn't have minded if the parts going back to Lena explaining the fallout and the bits of her marriage were just cut in at the end. Considering some of Garland's past work (Ex-Machina was great, and it ended on a surprisingly satisfying twist), it was a little disappointing. In a more minor complaint, I thought the score was overbearing. The song they decide to use in those flashbacks works but the rest of it blares and it was more of a distraction instead of helping things along.Despite my negative reaction to some of Annihilation, I did like this movie. I never turned on it or found my interest waning. I just got a little caught up in the hype around it and the final product was decent to me, instead of amazing. Garland is still one of the better directors working in this genre and I'm eager to see what he does next. Most of my problems I think come from the source material instead of his script or his directing anyway. If you loved this movie, I don't have a problem with that. A lot of people were calling this the next Arrival and I don't think it reached that level. I'll just be waiting for the Blu-ray or its release on Netflix instead of going to the theatre for my next viewing of Annihilation.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Rating of 7.7 on March 13, 2018 is way too high...","Sadly IMDB ratings don't say too much about movies anymore. - I gave it a three, up's mostly for production quality, not for the story or acting performances which were extremely poor.It was the plan to release Annihilation in cinema's worldwide, I mean if you cast 'Natalie Portman', who somehow gets mis-casted quite often . I mean she is neither a ballerina (Black Swan, having the right weight is not nearly enough to look like a ballerina) nor a scientist (Annihilation, The idea alone, a woman does not become a cancer research professor in her early 40's after 7-years of combat experience in the Army. It does not work like that.) - Annihilation became a straight to Netflix movie. Annihilation is like so many of those B-SciFi movies. The only difference in this case is that it is based on a novel and has some A-listers in the cast.The movie is boring. I bet you fall asleep watching, or quit watching long before the movie ends.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Ok sci fi horror, but expected better...","Following on from his excellent film Ex Machina, Alex Garland brings us Annihilation - a horror (ish) tale about a group of scientists who investigate 'the shimmer' - an ever expanding zone of bizarre biological activity that is eminating from a crashed meteor and altering everything it engulfs at the genetic level. Loosely based on a novel, I like the concept of this film (questionable science aside) - it has some interesting characters, beautiful sets and suitably disturbing abominations of nature... but as it goes on it doesn't really raise the stakes, and the ending is... a bit contrived and unsatisfying. Overall I liked it, but will probably never watch it again.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Kind of watchable but doesn't do anything new,"'Annihilation' is what should happen when a hapless director tries to play pulp. It's been called 'weird fiction' but the most weird thing about it is the attempt to straddle contemplation and shoot-'em-ups; this film is essentially a remake/cross between Tarkovsky's Stalker and King Kong, and without the integrity of either. It sounds like an interesting experiment to combine such disparate film styles, (and as everyone knows a talented director like Nolan can pull it off), but Garland struggles to measure up to either end. The monster action seems out of place, arbitrary, even pandering, while the more meditative elements simply pale in comparison to what Tarkovsky already did. Nothing really meshes or creates any new insights.It's at least more ambitious and watchable than Garland's ugly, joyless, pointlessly violent Dredd remake, with rare moments of beauty and some interesting effects, like a person who explodes and becomes a floating pulsing blob thing. At any rate those who would find Stalker too boring may find a 'cooler' alternative here, with more gore and hipster musing. Now this director has fallen back into the loving arms of equally anti-human studio A24, and I can't say I'm looking forward to whatever the result will be of such a collaboration.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Self-important B-movie,"Annihilation riffs on Stalker, Predator and The Thing and manages to be worse than all of them, even Stalker, and that was really boring.The problem is that Garland's script is more interested in the science fiction of 'The Shimmer' rather than the characters, so we end up with Lena (Portman), the bland protagonist; Dr. Ventress (Leigh), the insufferable team leader with a smugly nonchalant demeanour; Anya (Rodriguez), an aggressive, thuggish stock character; and Josie (Thompson), a bookish non-entity. There was one other, I think, but when the characters are this disposable, who cares?There is little to make up for this dearth of character and chemistry; we get some sense of adventure and a few thrills and scares but in each case they are fleeting and mediocre. Instead, we get a bit of jumped-up B-movie science fiction that's presented in a miserably glum, portentous manner. Also, the CGI has a distinct lack of tangibility and is thoroughly overused.",,Anonymous,Horror
"If the movies Arrival and Ex-Machina had a baby, this would be it.","When Annihilation came out last year on Netflix of all places, it has been on my list to go and watch but aside from starring Natalie Portman, there was little buzz around it so I put it under the ""Watch Later"" category. Read that the reason it was released directly to Netflix was due to creative differences between the producer and distributor. Back then direct to Netflix sounded like a death sentence and for this movie it was, only getting a theatrical release in the US, Canada, and China since the director did not want to change the movie because the distributor found it too intellectual and therefore not accessible. The movie bombed and even failed to breakeven but is it a testament to how bad the movie is? Not necessarily.We follow Lea (Portman) who takes over the mission his husband (Isaac) ""survived"" from, unable to give her answers after being gone for a year and suddenly comes back like an empty shell of his former self. Lea along with a team of women, damaged in their own ways, set out to find anything they can from this mysterious glow that started engulfing a certain area in the US. Portman, as expected, delivers while Isaac was shooting this and the Last Jedi back-to-back like literally, he would walk from one studio to the next if he had to shoot scenes for both movies on the same day. Tessa Thompson has been everywhere (Thor, Westworld) but she brings in something new to each character. Gina Rodriguez did okay but I thought Michelle Rodriguez would've been more imposing.So, the final verdict? The distributor wasn't wrong that Annihilation may come off as too intellectual and therefore the audience might distance themselves from it. But the producer and director were also right to keep it the way it was. The movie moved slowly but it was engaging enough that it will keep you wanting to find out what's going on even if you know it will possibly lead to your demise. Which is the theme of the movie really, the propensity of humans for self-destruction. We see it in our eating habits, on how we disregard nature and the propagation of fake news. No matter what we do we are going to die, it's just a question of whether you will run towards it, or have readied yourself to face it when it's your time, or if you will fight it. My only regret is not watching this on a bigger screen. The visuals will have your mouth watering.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Takes a bit to wrap you head around the ending but it's good. Uses flashbacks throughout and those also take a bit to wrap your head around but it all makes sense once you do.

The most unoriginal aspect of this film is the characters, some of a little cookie cutter. But im not sure theres such a thing as original characterization in film anymore. Its all been done before. But stories? There are still original stories to be told. And Annihilation is proof of that.

"Its a knock knock, but nobody is home kind of movie.","This thing stretched credulity a little too much as to how the authorities would react to the main event in this piece. Too many things are left unexplained, and are left to the imagination. It started that trend when one of the characters somehow gets from point A to point B without explanation. It's an okay sci fi piece, but we do want our sci fi to be understood on some level. It starts to explain the phenomenon as the movie proceeds. Then it goes off on a senseless horror imagery tangent. Finally it ends on some kind of existential take on the question of who and what we are. And though we sometimes like movies that make you think, the movie itself failed to be entertaining enough to provoke such thought. The acting was superb and Portman, was well, Portman.

The biggest flaw to me is the acting of Natalie and Oscar, both of them we know are not weak performers, i think the vision of the director is just what it is, that's something i noticed watching DEVS (that main character, not the best). Another thing i think may make or break the movie for you.PD: If you are into Lovecraft or Lovecraftian stuff, this is a must watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A slow burn but worth the trip,"This is one of those quiet horror sci-fi films á la Sunshine, Silent House, As Above So Below. Much more action and tension than the book, but no cliché chases or alien motivation/society descriptions. Portman's character carries the script and she plays the equally tortured and bewildered soul simultaneously pretty well. The animosity among the main characters is apparent, which is a little weird since they should be on the same page but their personalities arent. The most interesting is Jennifer Jason Leigh's persona as a cold bitch who doesnt seem to care about anyone. She plays it with a monotone deadpan delivery that stands out well in these circumstances. A few out-of-place sequences and a predictable conclusion have reduced my rating but still worth a look if you stay focused and let it draw you in.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Spell-Binding Sci-Fi Film!,"Based on the novel of the same name by Jeff VanderMeer, 'Annihilation' written and directed by Alex Garland, is a film so deep in its truest sense, that it demands to be felt, as well as experienced. This is A Spell-Binding Sci-Fi Film, that brings its mysterious world with a thought-provoking twist.'Annihilation' Synopsis: A biologist (A Terrific Natalie Portman) signs up for a dangerous, secret expedition where the laws of nature don't apply.'Annihilation' has too many themes & yet Garland, a well-deserved Oscar-Nominee for the unforgettable Ex Machina, brings a sense of doom & humanity to the intense & at times, scary proceedings. 'Annihilation' is not merely a Sci-Fi flick with a horror element, this is a deeply poetic & heartbreaking story, that deals with life, death, self-destruction & the consequences of life. I won't give away all any spoilers here, as this is a film, that needs to be viewed with all its might. Also, considering the amount of themes & ideas 'Annihilation' has to offer, everyone viewing this film, just like me, will have his/her own ideology of the film. And that's the beauty of Garland, who creates a scary & beautiful world, where violence, grief & realization play a big part. I was hooked all through.Garland is master. 'Annihilation' isn't an easy film to write or direct, but Garland takes the challenge & delivers one of the strongest Sci-Fi Films of recent memory. This is spell-binding stuff, that challenges its viewer to think beyond the general. Garland's Writing & Direction, both, are top-notch. Rob Hardy's Cinematography captures the unsettling mood, with brilliance. Barney Pilling's Editing is bang-on. Art & Costume Design are fabulous. Visual Effects are sharp. 
Ben Salisbury & Geoff Barrow's Score is haunting.Performance-Wise: Natalie Portman's portrayal of a troubled protagonist looking out for answers, is one for the ages. Its a magnificent performance, that shows the Oscar-Winner at her brightest. The superb Jennifer Jason Leigh brings depth to her part, proving once again how underrated she is. Gina Rodriguez is in top-form. The actress commands the screen. Tessa Thompson & Tuva Novotny lend remarkable support.

An Opinion After A 2nd Viewing .,"It was a bizarre experience to start from the 1st time but now...
I wouldn't say it was worth it. Most of the films I tend to go back to either get better or worse for me. I had the same viewing experience after watching this as the 1st time.So if you're looking for a plot description you're not gonna get it from me, but I can tell you two or three things on why my view of the film hasn't change all that much.First it's a solid film but not fully commited to the ideas it's presenting. And a big letdown and what keeps me from loving it. Alex Garland of course is not stranger to sci-fi (watch the excellent Ex-Machina) has found creative ways to visualize the pages which this movie is adapted from but fails to keep a coherent structure.My conclusion is that it's a solid flick with good performances, goood ideas, here and there, not fully expanded to their potential. It's not commited to giving us either a crazy and abstarct film (2001) nor a intelligent and enviromental thriller with less confusing turns. It tries to explain some things, all within two or three lines of dialogue and puts you into visual trance and aberration only towards the finale.

More like a drama that has some sprinkling of horror and action,"There were things I really liked about this movie, like how it strived to be slightly different and beautiful in some ways. The visuals were well done, the music score set a tone of unease and wonder at the same time. The acting was fairly ok. The idea behind it was intriguing and makes me want to read the book it was based on. However....There were some pretty big plot holes that were hard to forgive, I kept thinking, well if this was real the military would do things this way. There was a made for tv vibe when it came to the ""horror"" aspects and I think it's because there was so little of it and spread so far apart that it felt slow, hence why this feels more like a drama.There are a lot of unexplained things in this movie that don't really resolve to a statisfying point and at one point I thought well I guess that is kind of the point of this movie. It's a bit of a philosophical noggin scratcher so if you are not in the mood to question the meaning of your own existence and how life as we know it is a construct of our own psyche then skip this one and watch Predator (a straight up shoot em up sci fi action. slightly horror movie).All in all I was entertained by this movie but I can see why people don't like it.

Different and yet a little predictable.,"Without giving any of the suspense or essences of the storyline away, I think the innovative concepts about Alien invasion which are proposed in the movie are outstanding. However, the human angle, the cover story to forward the theme, wasn't completely exploited. Somehow, narrative felt somewhat incomplete, like, the director could have spared another 30 minutes and added something more to the plot to connect all the dots!Natalie Portman was outstanding as always, the supporting characters were predictable, you will find them in all alien movies which was one of the let downs.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Incredible in its ability to create awe-inspiring moments.,"So this isn't a perfect film by any means. It has some rough dialogue at times, some unnecessary exposition at times (were the interrogation scenes really needed?), and some much-too-often-used-stereotypes (studying psychology myself, I can't tell you how irksome it is to see films label characters as ""psychologists"" and make various assumptions about them). The film also explains many characters by tragic pasts that are too clichéd. But those are all flaws that, in the grand scheme of things, don't amount to negatively impacting the experience of watching this film, because this is a wildly ambitious, fascinating project. It's rare for me to watch a sci-fi film and experience awe while doing so, but this film does that. Technically it's very well-made. Although some of the visual effects are clunky, the cinematography, editing, and (especially) film score give the entire thing an incredibly mysterious, genuinely interesting atmosphere, one that many films could only dream of creating (perhaps only Arrival's is similar). It also includes some of the most visually memorable moments of this entire decade. The last 15 minutes are awe-inspiring in every sense of the word. They say originality is dead, but I don't think I have ever seen some of the things this film does. For that it should be congratulated. It may be more flawed than Ex Machina, but Garland may have created a film that, not only rivals it, but perhaps exceeds it in its greatness, definitely in ambition and scope.",,Anonymous,Horror

Intriguing setting and atmosphere capped by poor characters,"Alex Garland has slowly built up a cult following in the last fifteen years. He started out as a writer doing appreciated independent films such as 28 Days Later and Sunshine. He went more mainstream by writing and allegedly directing (according to Karl Urban) Dredd in 2012. The film surprised both critics and fans with its great writing and atmosphere. Garland now had the freedom to create his own projects, which is exactly what he did in 2014 when he released his biggest hit as a writer and director, Ex Machina. He's back in 2018 with another well made and ambitious sci-fi film, Annihilation.The film starts out introducing us to Lena (Natalie Portman), an ex-marine who is now a biology professor. One day, her presumed dead husband Kane (Oscar Isaac) returns from his secret mission, but he's not the same as before. He quickly becomes deathly ill and is forcibly transferred to a military hospital. It's revealed there that Kane's secret mission was a recon assignment within a mysterious place known as ""The Shimmer"".The Shimmer doesn't come from Earth and it doesn't follow the rules of our planet. Unfortunately for humans, The Shimmer is expanding and is seemingly inhospitable to us. Lena and a crew of fellow women must venture into The Shimmer to understand and stop our extinction.The film can be described as action and sci-fi oriented. There's an aura of mystery carried throughout that keeps us hooked as we beg for new information to be revealed. The women all receive the same information we get and none of them know more than us. This immediately connects us to their fate as we watch them embark on an expedition that could only be classified as suicidal.The Shimmer itself is the best part of the film as it is treated as a central character. Within it, reality bends through spins on the laws of science. Animals are crossed between species, time is diluted, and cells react differently than what was thought possible. Everything is interesting to watch and think about, and it is all grounded enough to be believable.Garland gives the film a philosophical theme about human nature and how we deal with the unknown. The whole way through we watch as Lena and the crew react to the unknown world around them. All the character react differently and some react more. It's a careful examination of what about us makes us human and what separates ourselves from everyone else.Garland has written a great premise with amazing atmosphere and setting, but he didn't really write good characters for us to follow along with. Lena as the main protagonist is pretty good, but her supporting cast pales and is barely tolerable. Each of the supporting women in the group is all one dimensional and have little to no with original traits. I couldn't tell you their names immediately after hearing them.The characters also didn't have good chemistry and always felt too distant. I know the women didn't know each other before the mission, but their relationship never felt developed.Just like the characters, Natalie Portman is the only person here to give a good performance. She's fully invested in the role and quickly adapts her performance with the circumstance. Her facial expressions are key to us for understanding the complex material.Jennifer Jason Leigh gives one of her worst performances as Ventress, the leader of the expedition. She's extremely onenote as the commanding officer and becomes frustratingly annoying by the midpoint.Tessa Thompson, Gina Rodriguez, and Tuva Novotny have all done better work than this as each feels way out of their element.Alex Garland has created his most ambitious and interesting film yet, packed to the wall with sci-fi elements that constantly make you think and wonder. While he didn't fill his world with interesting characters, Annihilation still ends up being a smart film that delivers on its puzzling promises.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ahead of its Time,"There is so much good here, but first, let's start with the visuals; shall we? The third act of this film will draw many comparisons to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", and that is totally fair. This film, much like Kubrick's masterpiece, slips from a sci-fi adventure film towards a psychedelic, quasi-existential, super-metaphysical meditation in the end. The result is magical, bizarre, and, in a way, terrifying. Throughout the film (before we loose our minds completely to the world of Area X), the visuals are utterly compelling; the film is unlike anything else I've seen. In a way, it's indescribable until you see it for yourself.
In the book, Lena's character is known primarily as The Biologist (likewise, the other characters are also known primarily by their occupations); the biologist has a hard time connecting to anyone; in fact there's a scene when the biologist is asked what she would do if she were infected by Area X, and she responds saying she'd take a sample of herself. She is cold, calculated. She has a hard time caring for anything other than what she's working on. There's a scene in this film when Lena is speaking with Daniel, he says that it's not him she hates; it's herself. She responds by saying, ""No, Daniel, I hate you too."" That line captures the essence of the novel perfectly. Portman's distant portrayal of Lena matches exactly how the Biologist would react. I believe it's brilliantly executed. But, for those looking for warmth within characters, don't come here.
Garland's direction, too, is pretty impressive. For those unfamiliar with his other work, check out his directorial debut, ""Ex Machina"" (2014), for which he received a Best Original Screenplay nomination. Garland's career is already quite impressive; he's penned a few very notable scifi films including ""Sunshine"" (2007), ""28 Days Later"" (2002), and ""Dredd"" (2012). He was also, reportedly, paid a million dollars for writing the Halo movie, which never seemed to get off the ground. The stylistic choices Garland made in ""Ex Machina"" are elaborated upon in this film; there's plenty of subtle symbolism (and some not so subtle). His ability to create an atmosphere much like Vandermeer's books was what really blew me away. Upon reading the Southern Reach Trilogy, I thought the books were essentially unfilmable, but Garland has proven me wrong, and I'm very happy he did.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"A shiny turd, is still a turd.","This movie is bad. I'll out right say it. It's really bad. Like I'd rather watch Attack of Clones and the Cat in the Hat bad. This movie has some stunning visuals....sometimes. The CGI is terribly inconsistent. Some of the plants and wildlife look pretty good, but the entirety of the sky and sun look bad. I know when inside the Shimmer some colors will be different but the lighting is very poor in this film.I will say this Natalie Portman's performance was great. And sadly it was the best part of the movie. Her performance is the only reason why this movie isn't a 1/10. The rest of the cast fails to do anything memorable. I don't believe it is the actors faults, they all seemed talented, I blame the lousey writing. The pacing is all over the place and it leaves you feeling not confused, but rather cheated. The violence in this movie is very over the top. I don't mind blood and guts, but it was like Doom or Duke Nukem style of violence, where it is overly ridiculous and nonsensical; it clashes heavily with the melodramatic and ""realistic"" tone of the rest of the movie.This film comes across as very arrogant and self important. As if it has some huge greater meaning. It doesn't. This movie was more mind numbing than Transformers: The last Knight, because at least I can laugh or enjoy myself while munching on some popcorn watching Transformers.

"engaging, scary, creative and thought-provoking","""Annihilation"" (R, 1:55) sounds like it should be a sci-fi - horror - action movie. As the musical prophet (Meat Loaf) has taught us: two out of three ain't bad. This movie is firmly in the sci-fi / horror camp. There is some action, but the focus is more on the characters - a female cast, atypical for the genre.Oscar winner Natalie Portman stars as Lena, a medical school biology instructor and former U.S. Army soldier, whose active-duty special forces husband (Golden Globe winner Oscar Isaac) goes missing on a top-top secret mission - for a whole year. When Kane suddenly shows up in the hallway outside his old bedroom, he's... not himself. After an emotional embrace, Lena demands answers from the practically catatonic Kane, but he doesn't have many. Then, he experiences a severe medical episode which lands him - and Lena - in a top-top-top secret government facility just outside a gradually expanding land and shoreline area called ""The Shimmer"", hidden behind a colorful curtain of light through which drones, animals and people have been sent, never to be seen or heard from again, well, except for Kane, that is.Rather than sitting on her hands while Kane may be dying in that building, Lena talks the facility's psychologist (Oscar nominee Jennifer Jason Leigh), into letting her come on the expedition she's about to lead into the Shimmer, along with three fellow scientists, played by Gina Rodriguez, Josie Radek and Tuva Novotny. Since the male military teams haven't been able to survive the Shimmer, maybe, just maybe, female scientists (or, simply, scientists, as one of them points out to Lena) will be able to have more success. They each have their own reasons for volunteering for what may well turn out to be a suicide mission, and they each have their own struggles surviving an environment in which strange, new plants and animals exist - and rapidly... mutate - as do the bodies and minds of those in this expedition.With ""Annihilation"", ""Ex Machina"" writer/director Alex Garland adapts the novel of the same name (the first in the ""Southern Reach"" trilogy) by Jeff VanderMeer and helms the film as well. As in Garland's previous work, the character development is excellent, the acting is great and the optics (the visual effects and the creatures) are stunning. This film is engaging, scary, creative and thought-provoking - Alex Garland at his finest. Framing the story in the context of a post-expedition interview does little to enhance the story and it actually reveals more of the story (told in flashbacks) than necessary - and the pace of much of the film is a bit slow - but ""Annihilation"" is solid, inventive and entertaining enough to make up for those minor flaws.

Interesting idea amateurishly executed,"When a 'dirrctor' is more interested in how cool/unusual/etc his shot will look, there's series problems (the one I'm referring to comes early on - it's a conversation between 2 people. When Hollywood got Cinerama/CinemaScope, they looked for interesting ways to fill the expense. Then - when these films were broadcast on (analogue) TV, they were 'panned and scanned', since these wide shots couldn't be seen in the squarish sets. This... auteur (Alex Garland) has a conversation with 2 people - actors a table. What does this genus do? He films it from DOWN A HALLWAY. As is that's not enough, he has the 2 people so far in the background the only part of them seem is their legs. Actually, only one of their legs are seen. The other's nothing more than a monotone voice).'Long ago' - in pre-history as m-ll-n--ls refer to any time before them - in the early 80s, there was much comment about the influx of people who'd made their initial Mark in advertising - filming TV adverts.Such prior as Ridley Scott were discusses as being more interested in the image - bit the story.While I'm a fan of (several of) Mr Scott's work, his work is Vincente Minelli compared to the airless, self-absorbed nonsense seem in films sick as this.The casting is bizarre - or more accurately as dry as this entire endeavour. A woman who's supposed to be a 'psychiatrist' is played by Jennifer Jason Leigh. Though I do like me Leigh, every single thing I've ever seen her in, she plays someone who's usually emotionally fragile, and/or depressed. It's not unusual too discuss Ms Leigh and 'cuckoo' in the same sentences. It's NOT smart/clever to put Ms Leigh as a
someone who's supposed to help with psychological problems. She's as reassuring as nails on a blackboard. Here, she's blank, and miscast as anything I've seen in a while (hint; even in film, such a character should be able to engage other characters. That's their job. Having someone - working with either mentally ill people (for real), or in film would be as open an e receptive to speaking to this bobblr-head as one would want to speak to a cop who's just written you a ticket.Sadly, in Hollywood, 'failure' is upwards.

Think, invasion of the body snatchers, if it mutated with Aliens, but not really as good as either one of those.The cast did an admiral job for what they were given to do. Of the group though, I'd say the lead actor (Portman), gave the most ""going through the motions"" performance, but I was at least happy to see that they found an actor (Oscar Isaac) whose height best match that of her.I think I expected more thrills or surprises from this movie, but none of that happened.

"Engaging, entrancing, but the pace needs tightening, and there is not as much there as the tone suggests","Opening on Netflix in the UK, I heard about this film because it was unusual that such a high-profile film would come direct to a streaming service rather than the 'traditional' route. I also read a tense interview with Garland where he was clearly frustrated that the film wouldn't show on a big screen, probably feeling a lot would be lost in the front room TV. Despite not doing well in the US, the reviews were good so I gave it a go.The film opens slowly, which I suppose is an early indication of how most it will go. The introductory 'chapter' structure is nothing new, but works well here, and the film has a solid tension to it as it journeys into the core of the mystery zone. As it goes, the film gets more interesting as we see more impact of the DNA changes to everything within the zone, as well as the horror and danger than comes with it. This aspect is well done but perhaps could have used more fear and urgency - when it gets it, it is good but too often it seems a bit disconnected. The pace and tone of the film suggest that it wants to be more about ideas and sci-fi themes than about horror or tension, even if it tries to do both. In terms of the former, the tone makes it feel really smart and reflective, but really there is not as much there as it suggests; at the end you'll have enjoyed the creation of this place and the things within it, but will not be left pondering the ideas or characters for long.The characters are interesting, albeit a little underserved. The all-female cast may have contributed to the film not doing as well, but probably not that much since word of the tone/pace probably kept the masses away on the basis that it was 'cerebral' rather than a 'proper' sci-fi with action and wit. Ironically, within the film the cast help it a lot. Portman is great throughout. Thompson is nicely subdued and I wanted her to have more time. Jason Leigh is solid, and Rodriguez does okay but jars a little at times in terms of not convincing in her role in the team. Supporting players such as Wong, Isaac, and a few others add quality. The design and delivery of the film is just as much of a star though; it looks great throughout, and the use of sound and music is mostly very good - I share Garland's feeling that probably the cinema would have been a much better way to have seen this.Annihilation will be a nice find on Netflix, and it is a quality film in the most part, even if there is not as much to it as it would like to think, and has issues with pacing and tone.",,Anonymous,Horror

As many others have already said, this is a mess, full of pretty visuals, philosophy and psychology, yet devoid of real substance. I am not sure that even the crew, director and actors knew what they were aiming for. Is is a thriller? A horror? A drama? Sci-fi? I can only tell you what it wasn't-deep and existentialist, as they most probably wanted it to be. Too many plot holes, some phenomenal in its scope lazy writing. People already mentioned why there is almost no logic and common sense to be found in the scientific team's actions and motives, I am not gonna repeat it. Oh, the idea behind the movie was more than promising. But instead of making a decent Sci-Fi action movie with some thriller and horror elements, or to fully go for a deeper, more philosophic film, something like Arrival or Solaris, they went for a mix of all these, failing completely to present a finished and polished end product. Plus, the pace at time was unbearably slow, further killing any joy from the movie.

"Thoughtful and Interesting, But Far From Perfect","A joint scientific/military probe explores an unseen alien force that's taken up residence in the Florida swamplands and begun altering the wildlife. As you can probably surmise from the trailers, this is more of a slow, melancholy wander through the unknown than a guns-blazing action thriller, though there are some moments of noisy chaos.Natalie Portman gets the close-ups, in a downplayed, nigh-emotionless role, but the unseen, undefined foreign creature has the heaviest presence. Fundamentally unfamiliar with our flora and fauna, it's been inspecting local life at a biological level, toying with genetic code and producing circus-mirror amalgamations that are just as confused about their own existence as we are. In many cases, the results are a beautiful sight to behold, but there's always a lingering sense of unease, something off and disturbing about what's unfolding before us. The worst of these experiments manifests when the human invaders are at their most over-stressed, an unsettling evening showdown with a lumbering, wailing behemoth. Not to give anything away, but it's the first time in years I've felt legitimately terrified by a monster on film.There's a lot to unpack here, some tricky territory to navigate, and for the first hour it feels like we're walking in mud. Hurry isn't a word in Annihilation's vocabulary, even when it's being chased, and I think many viewers will find that off-putting. I'll confess that it does ultimately bear fruit, though the quality depends upon your interpretation. I enjoyed it more than the book, which gradually lost track of what made the concept so interesting in the first place, but it endures different troubles. If anything, I felt numb by the end. Slowly beaten down by the slog, the bland, frank, matter-of-fact leads and the lack of real answers.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Annihilate this moronic film,"A bit of medical mumbo jumbo mixed in with a nebulous sci-fi theme and...a bunch of semi-militarized women wandering through some kind of radioactive jungle. We're treated to numerous flashbacks of supposedly meaningful bedroom talk which is probably interesting if you're a Lifetime fan but does absolutely nothing for the rest of us.The little action that occurs is absolutely not worth the wait.I should've known, of course, when I saw Portman's name in it, that a mainstream film with a ""popular"" actress is bound to be vanilla.

Unfair Criticism: This film deserves more than one viewing,"I have never seen anything like Alex Garland's Annihilation. I think this film is beautiful science fiction perfection. I had the same feelings flood over me viewing it at the cinema that I get whenever I watch Alien or Blade Runner. I see most reviews here rate the film a 5 or a 6, and I feel like these reviewers did not see the same film I have. The story is intriguing and unique, and I for one value originality greatly in this current culture of endless sequels, reboots, and remakes.Don't pay attention to the negativity. Give this film your full attention. The characters are developed, performances are strong, cinematography grand, and it is filled with fantastic visuals. There are some horror elements too. This movie is about a transformational experience. If you want to take a psychedelic sci-fi trip, then this movie is for you.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Another Beautiful and Thought-Provoking Film From Alex Garland,"The film follows a team of individuals as they progress through a mysterious alien dimension known as the Shimmer; all the while increasingly noticing the affects the area has on them and the environment. The acting on every character's part was great, especially the lead: Natalie Portman. As someone who is unfortunately super critical of unconvincing roles, Portman's character really stood out to me and felt real. Additionally, the amazing visuals seen before in ""Ex Machina"" definitely translate over to this work as well. The cinematography and images in ""Annihilation"" are hauntingly beautiful. I really enjoyed the way the film used aspects like genetic mutation and alteration to convey the theme of metamorphosis. The director, Alex Garland, is adept in producing suspenseful, intriguing stories, while still being able to work in powerful philosophical concepts that make audiences think.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

This is NOT a Sci-fi action movie!!!,"I saw this movie in theaters when it first came out. My ex and I left the theater scratching our heads wondering what the hell we had just watched. The marketing had led me to believe I was going to see a sci-fi/fantasy action movie. It is...not that. To say the least, at the time I was miffed that I'd paid to see a confusing and convoluted film that was more of a horror movie than anything, and I LOVE horror movies. But it wasn't clicking for me yet.Yesterday I was watching videos on YouTube reviewing the best cosmic horror films and this movie kept coming up on the lists, always ranking near the top. So I rewatched it today and lo and behold, when viewing this as a cosmic horror film it is fantastic. I find Natalie Portman to be a fairly wooden actress at best, but she's not a bad actress. So her less than stellar performance is completely forgivable. If you're not into cosmic horror then you probably won't enjoy this film. That's why other sites have such high critic ratings; they saw the movie what it actually is and not what it was marketed as.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Unique cerebral sci-fi, left me feeling tepid afterwards despite mindblowing ending","When Ex Machina came out in theaters, my mind was blown. I loved every aspect of it and it was one of the few movies that really got to me. It was a slow and cerebral sci-fi movie with a fantastic set, amazing performances, and really cool atmosphere.So I was excited to see that Alex Garland was making his second directorial movie.Annihilation is definitely a polarizing movie to most. Like Ex Machina it is a slow, plodding movie, it's meant to be a slow burn kind of sci-fi. The team takes their time moving through the shimmer world trying to figure out what this extraterrestrial thing is. For the most part it works, but there are stretches of it that really lack intrigue.That's where this one really lacks in comparison to Ex Machina. Besides Portman's character, the rest of the team are just throwaway characters that you really just don't care about at all. Each of the three leads in Ex Machina were so well developed that you really did start to care for Eve and wanted Caleb to help her get away from her abusive creator. Though I get not ever character has to be developed as fully as a protagonist, but they need just a little bit for me to care as stuff starts happening to them in the shimmer.The ending is still something awe inspiring and left me staring at the screen in a state of wonder until the credits rolled through and then some. Very few movies make be feel that honestly Ex Machina was probably the last one.It's probably one that I need to see again without my preconceived notions of Ex Machina's greatness. It's just good to see that there are some studios willing to give people like Alex Garland a budget to make something experimental like this. They need to realized that not everyone always wants to see an Avengers type movie, that we do need to see stuff like Ex Machina, Arrival, Blade Runner and this movie too.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Annihilation: What a peculiar film,"Annihilation reminds me of The Sound of Thunder (2005), not entirely sure why. I did however enjoy SoT, I didn't so much this.Starring Natalie Portman, Jennifer Jason-Leugh and Tessa Thompson it has a very unusual plot I wouldn't even dream of summarizing here. Rest assured however nobody could accuse this of of being your standard Hollywood affair.Visually it's a treat with some startling beautiful visuals and plenty of nice ideas to go with them. It would be hard to dispute that Annihilation doesn't have its merits.It does however also have its flaws and plenty of them. For me it was poorly paced, it didn't exactly flow and the nice ideas don't feel entirely followed through. It plays the role of a smart movie that dives deep into the pseudo-scientific realms but alike many other similar movies just doesn't come across all that clever.More an experience than a movie I'd consider this very niche stuff.The Good:Some real beautiful imageryA few good ideasThe Bad:Doesn't all come together very wellThings I Learnt From This Movie:Natalie Portman and Keira Knightly are the same person. Have they been in a movie together? Exactly, got you thinking right?I'm still waiting to understand the Oscar Isaac appeal",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Complex but satisfying.,"""It's destroying everything."" The Psychologist, Dr. Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh)
""It's not destroying... It's making something new."" The Biologist, Lena (Natalie Portman)
And so it goes in science fiction, no firm answers, even divergent opinions, but a whimsy about the future that catches my imagination every time. Annihilation's complexity could put off those who want answers the text is reluctant to offer. For those who go with the flow, this enjoyable if a bit obtuse sci-fi thriller poses questions about who we are and what an alien force could possibly want with such a flawed species.The Shimmer is a new sci-fi concept monster about aliens or maybe our own nature conspiring to take over our lives, or duplicate them, Whatever, in the increasingly invasive world of the Shimmer, Lena has signed on with an all-woman patrol to enter the North Florida Area X (really shot in Great Britain forests) to find out the source of the invasion at a remote lighthouse and secretly find out why her husband, now returned from a similar patrol, is so strange.Although I'm not sure all this weirdness is in Lena's mind, let's assume for the moment it is. I favor the theory that a misguided affair with a colleague caused deep uncertainty about her identity and the fear that her husband, Kane (Oscar Isaac), found out about the affair. Suffering and losing identity would be a puritanical punishment for a foolish dalliance.On a sociological sci-fi basis, Annihilation may be about losing our flawed identities to an alien force that means to assimilate and forge new, benign identities for us. Not a bad idea given the toxic political world we live in.While debriefing Lena after her return from Shimmer land, a scientist asserts to Lena, ""You really have no idea what it was."" Nor do I.",,Anonymous,Horror
I Came In Expecting the Unexpected and I Got....Sorta What I Expected?,"I became interested in Alex Garland's work after watching Ex Machina a year or so ago. I was absolutely mesmerized by the writing and pacing, as well as the philosophical depth, of such an intense and unsettling film. When I began seeing the trailers and marketing for Annihilation, I had this feeling that this film was going to be beyond the horror sci-fi it was advertised to be. In a sense, I knew that the film was going to be as philosophically pleasing as Ex Machina, and beyond the scope of the typical horror sci-fi genre.Fast forward to me finishing Annihilation. I walked out of the theater with a mixed response. On one hand, it's a thought-provoking science fiction horror film; on the other hand, it's an incomplete story told with masterful direction. So here are my thoughts:The cinematography and design of this film are fantastic, that's without question. The film goes to great lengths to describe the world underneath the Shimmer, a world where biological rules are ignored and blur into hauntingly beautiful mutations of life. The design of the film is artwork in itself, the results of an expansive imagination that blends the genres of nature and horror. Much of the imagery in this film is beyond the likes I've ever seen in a sci-fi film. It's incredibly creative yet wholly familiar.The pacing and direction of this film as a horror film is gripping; I found myself holding my breath during several key climactic moments (that more or less involved excruciating and toe-curling gore). It's so incredible that the very design of the film and the way it's directed makes just looking at the mutated imagery of the Shimmer's effect on nature stomach-churning; Garland takes great care in establishing suspense and letting it pay off with the unimaginable.The story was unsatisfactory and riddled with plot holes. Maybe I was expecting too much, but I felt the film the was trying to portray a philosophical and abstract message with the film but failed to do so. The subplot of the film (involving Natalie Portman's character's personal life) doesn't seem to tie to the main plot and its devices, and feels incomplete. The supporting characters' backstories are explored but doesn't seem to have much relevance in terms of symbolism with the main plot. Anywhere where I can find an interpretation/abstract meaning of the film, I'll find it, especially for an Alex Garland film, but this one was tough to interpret, and thus felt incomplete for me. Too much attention was brought to the subplots and not enough was given to connecting them to the main plot.That said, the film manages to maintain interest in the story; it plays off as a mystery, slowly peeling the intricacies of its world and story layer by layer, keeping its audience invested as they try to unravel the fantastic elements of the story. I overall was happy with how intense and horrific this piece of art is, but felt the story was lacking and too ambiguous to develop any meaning from it, whether it be on a plot level or a philosophical one.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Underrated masterpiece,"I suppose this is a bit too much of a slow and bizarre movie for most, but as someone who studied storytelling, I can't help but obsess over this amazing picture. Everything is so well put together. And the music just gives me goosebumps every time! The movie slowly turns more dreamlike and the ending really captures that alien feeling so well. I love the concept of an alien 'invading' this world, but doesn't particularly want anything from us. It's so hard to imagine something that doesn't want. It's so opposite of how we are built. I think this movie captured that concept perfectly and the slow pacing only contributes to it. Definitely not a movie for everyone, though. And again, the music is just stunning. Absolutely love this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

You might be annihilated from boredom...,"I found this movie by random luck on Netflix. I decided to give it a watch solely from what the synopsis read.I didn't even know who was in the movie, so it was a nice surprise to see that they actually had some interesting choices of actors and actresses in the movie. However the cast could only do so much for the movie, because it was horribly mauled by an abysmal script and ludicrous storyline that the movie was just fast sinking without any chance of rescue.The visuals in the movie were phenomenal though. Lots of nice details and that undead bear was especially amazing to watch. But special effects only carry a movie so far.The characters in the movie were one-dimensional and the lack of proper storyline just cut the movie down short and sent it spiraling downwards fast.I even dozed off twice along the way, because the story was so pointless and ridiculous. I did manage to stick with it to the end, but even the ending didn't even make any attempt to correct all the wrongs throughout the entire movie.This is definitely not a movie that I will be watching a second time around.

Brilliant or just kind of decent?,"I like to keep my reviews brief and in list form, so I will assume the reader has a basic understanding of the movie's plot and and an awareness of the main cast.PROS:Interesting concept, and has at least a good sense of mystery at the beginning. I like the general idea of a phenomenon causing rapid mutations / evolution in a contained area.Solid cast (if not entirely accurate, ahem). Although Gina Rodriguez was weirdly channeling Michelle Rodriguez for some reason. Still, it's Jane, so it's fine.There was a moment with a certain mutant bear that was genuinely creepy AF. Also, slithering intestines.CONS:The backstory of Lena (Portman) is slow and nuanced to the point of being boring. She and her husband (Isaac) don't really have strong enough chemistry in the beginning to make us care about their relationship and what happens to them -- or at least I didn't.The visual look of the ""Shimmer"" was not effectively alien to me. It just seemed like a soapy, rainbow-hued veneer, like something you would see in a music video.Portman's ragtag team were not interesting or developed (even as supporting characters), and there was very little interplay between them to provide a reason to care what happened to them.The ending, while visually interesting, was entirely unsatisfying and inexplicable.

New concepts but pretty thoughtless and laidback,"I was compelled to finish watching the film only after I was in the second half; till that point things seemed half-baked, witless, and barely interesting.When I first saw the poster, I saw Natalie Portman, with gun and a crew, against a misty forest backdrop. I immediately thought of survival, war, and Predator-esque alien encounter. Needless to add, I was sold.But, turns out, nothing much was like it. And honestly, it didn't matter.Visuals are good, and certain concepts (and scares) one-of-a-kind. My inquisitiveness throughout, much like some characters in the film, was intact, till the end.What I didn't like was that there were liberties being taken, that there were actions being rationalized-for example, Portman's character suddenly knows how to use a gun, and that too adroitly; only later we are told she had had a military background.Even tactically, things seemed a bit off: If I were to empathize and become one with the crew, I as a lay person, would have thought of doing a lot of things differently for my survival and the mission. And these people, who are scientists and with military intelligence, didn't know even the basics.Annihilation makes for an interesting watch only if you keep your thinking aside for a bit and indulge in the novelties the film has on offer. In any case, the film won't bore you.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Beautiful boredom,"This is rather beautiful boredom. The core story, production design and the cinematography are excellent. The film is so slow that even at 1.25x it is so slow and so boring that it is more pretentious than entertaining. It is very well acted but their characters are a bit forgettable although nothing too much to complain about. Sometimes, even before the main story kicks off, the film looked fake. As in, actual physical things like houses and rooms looked like they were CGI when there really was no reason for it. When the story really kicks off it doesn't matter at all that it looks CGI and fantastical. There are some really beautiful moments but not enough to get over how slow it is. Some moments go on so long, so very very long with nothing happening. The visual effects are great and so is the music.

Powerful Existential Horror Based on One of Lovecrafts Less Well Known Stories,"One of my favorite movies, this is a creative and unique take on the Color Out of Space by HP Lovecraft. The story is well crafted, the characters all feel real and have a good personality, and the story really flows well narratively. There are several very haunting moments throughout the story, and the ending is thought provoking and deeply unsettling. The themes of identity and creative destruction produce a fascinating arch that builds up to the very final scene, and leaves you wanting more. There is a good deal of body horror, but it's never grotesque or excessive, and in some cases is almost beautiful in the way its handled.The actors can feel a bit over the top at times, but that goes away as the story progressive and the actresses really step into their roles. The caste is almost entirely female, and despite this the movie never received any major gendered criticism, which is likely due to how well the story makes this choice make sense.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not as original as it seems...,"Annihilation, the most talked about scify of early 2018... and for good and bad reasons. This movies brings visuals and story telling in the same style as Arrival did last year, Kubrick inspired, bit of alien here, bit of 2001 there, like most scify to be honest. Nevertheless, it is interesting and original enough to be among the ones that came before. Not a masterpiece or to be classic, just solid with flaws.So lets talk about the most important aspect first; story. The story of annihilation starts with the ending, which grasps attention. Smart choice for the movie, since at times the situations in the plot seem very desperate and hopeless, which creates interest for the conclusion. 
The movie is at times very mysterious and subtle, but at others bombarding with exposition. Most plot points are explained to the audience through dialog, which feels like a lazy way of telling this somewhat (coming back to that later) interesting story.
The story itself, does not feel entirely satisfying. In some way it does, the main character finds out what she was looking for. But on the scify side of the story it feels a lot like 2001: a space odyssey. And with that I mean the unsatisfying way Kubrick wrote most of his movies (hear me out). Throwing in a lot of alien and mysterious concepts, packed in beautiful cinematography, but feeling very hollow in the conclusion. As an example, the scene in 2001 where they enter the gate or monolith (whatever you want to call it). Its a unique scene, terrifying, but goes on for so long without substance or meaning. The point is, it feels like its put in there to show some skill of the cinematographer or writer without adding to the film in anyway. A lot of scify elements of this movie feels like random bits from other scifies without adding any substance to the movie. 
This movie is not about characters but more so about flashy and freaky scify concepts. The characters feel quite flat, especially the supporting cast. The main character has some depth that is shown in the first act of the movie. We get to know some details about her, but other then that she does not change throughout the story. The supporting cast, apart from some minor traits, isn't developed at all. They have a mission of what only two of them get any motivation for (though very under developed motivation). 
The structure of the plot is quite regular, with the standard three act structure. And the usual 'sequel-hint' at the very end of the movie, although a sequel would be very unlikely.
One thing that bothered me a lot was the 'science' in this scify. As a former biology student and a human being with the capability to think, I thought there were some lazy scify elements that felt more as 'magic'. Talking about the DNA merging of species and transforming of organisms, sounds very fantasy if you ask me. It wouldn't have mattered if the movie did not try to explain the science and was leaning more on the fiction side of scify. But it did put in a lot of science, but in a lazy and almost offending way. Big con of this movie.So, coming to cinematography, where the other half of the shine can be found. Most of the scify bits of the movie look very refreshing and beautiful. The movie uses bright colors to depict alien activity and life forms, which feels very fresh. Some of the wide shots look amazing, with the contrast of bright colors of the nature/alien against darker colors anything human related.
The CGI is okay, it serves the purpose but it is very noticeable. Especially the animals made with CGI. This movie could age very well on any other part of the cinematography, except the CGI would prevent it from doing so.Natalie Portman steals the show; great acting, believeable, gripping. She carries the movie, there isn't much else going on with the acting other then what she delivers. Oscar Isaac was fine, didn't have a lot to do or to show. I thought Jennifer Jason Leigh was a total miscast, I may be baised from The Hateful Eight. Other then that, it is mainly Portman doing what she is great at, and she delivers.The music and sounddesign was fine. Nothing special really. It served the purpose, typical modern scify music really. Only at the end, in the final act, the music became a little too noticable and distracting (talking about electronic sounds).Overal, I thought the movie was fine. Not as good as the hype is trying to make it. The story bothered me at some points because of exposition bombarding and I expected a little more at the end due to all the mysteriousness during the first two acts. CGI was okay and futhermore nothing really stood out. Most of the science elements in this scify were downright lazy and dumb. It felt hollow, with a pretty and shiny outside.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Pretty Good,"I enjoyed it more than I did the book. Surprisingly, it had the skeleton frame of the book but was otherwise very different. Though, I only read the first book and not the entire trilogy, so there could have been some stuff worked in there. I would say you could read and watch the film and get almost two different stories. The film had a nice pace to it while the book ambled along not giving much payoff. It was sort of The Maze Runner for adults, but much more literary and not a rough draft of a book that somehow made it on the shelves.I most enjoyed the performance by Gina Rodriguez, whom I didn't recognize from Jane the Virgin, given her performance was such a departure. Tessa Thompson...I just like her performance from Thor: Ragnorak, so I'm going to like her regardless. The movie mostly centers around the women, the mystery, and the other world, so, the actor's performance is the most vital, as is the look of the film. They all did a great job. I personally hate Poe from Star Wars, so, it will be hard to package Oscar Issac to my liking, but, whatever, yeah, he's in it too.It had good tension, good mystery, looked great, good to great performances, and the overall film is an interesting take on the whole invasion concept which is typically involves lasers or alien possession. More of an interesting thought piece. I don't remember the whole biology angle playing in the book that much, other than she was a biologist...but that could be because I was bored of the book ambling along, but I did think it was interesting in the film, the whole concept of splitting cells. They even weaved it into being a bit poetic, intermingled with the horror-type elements.Not great like the new Blade Runner, but a decent enough film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Breathtaking Art. Philosophical and cerebral.,"""The only way into truth is through one's own annihilation; through dwelling a long time in a state of extreme and total humiliation""-- Simone WeilThe movie is slow at first and isn't without its flaws and somewhat weakly built side characters. However, this movie is deeply profound and philosophically important. Why do we destroy ourselves? Why are we afraid of change? Why are we afraid of the unknown? This movie might not give all of the answers, but it certainly gives all of the questions. It made me feel so deeply. The score is one of the best I've heard since Interstellar and perfectly pairs with that deep thinking I get from it. The effects and cinematography are jaw dropping. The last 30 minutes are the minutes I seek in film the most. It felt like the culmination of seeking destruction of oneself for a cancerous affair that grew and led to death but leaving a brand-new person instead. This film ""lacking action"" or being ""too cerebral"" are lazy and boring criticisms. If you only like your sci fi movies to be like John Wick, that's fine, but don't criticize the ones that try things differently. Ultimately, this stands out in the way that 2001, Stalker, or The Arrival do. They're more than just a movie. I knew Alex Garland was special after having seen Ex Machina, but this seals the deal in that he will go down as one of the kings of sci fi of the 2010s and beyond.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Could have been much better,"I have to say, i had high expectations coming in, all the trailers looked great, the reviews were great and its thrown around as a great cosmic horror movie, but i could only feel more and more underwhelmed as the movie went on. The movie movie wants to tackle an interesting theme: the destruction and rebirth of oneself, which it does fairly competently, but its really handicapped by the surface plot and action.The shimmer is an ever expanding area where everyone and everything that has entered it has never been found, with the exception of one person who is dying and can't remember anything, and yet it feels like the people involved in this mission have no competence to speak of:Dr Ventress is the only person who we ever see in charge of the operation, and she goes inside the Shimmer with only 4 other people out of which only one has military training while the others have zero experience in harsh conditions, none of them have gas masks, gloves, never mind a protective suit, body armors and a helmets, why didn't they at least enter the shimmer in a vehicle? Why didn't they go by boat when the lighthouse is right next to the beach? A helicopter could have reached the lighthouse in a few hours, ( i haven't mentioned but the source of the shimmer is at a lighthouse, the groups mission is to reach it and find out what it is exactly. ), they don't even have a journal or something to make notes, this could be useful in a place where people forget the things they did.And these are questions that come up in the first 15-20 minutes of the movie, and equally as many in the rest, none of which get answered, logic wise, this movie has little.Aesthetically its a mixed bag, cinematography and scenery are really beautiful, that is definitely the highlight of this movie, but anything that moves, creatures, mutations etc. are just...very obviously CGI, and it takes you out of the movie completely.This movie is very confused in what it wants to be, through the movie i had to wonder, what am i watching?Is this trying to be cosmic horror?
Is it trying to be action scfi-fi?
Or a Tarkovsky-esque philosophical drama?Because it has elements of all of these mentioned but it never really succeeds at any of them or commits to one path, and this is perfectly illustrated by the music, one moment its dark choral music ( like the ones from 2001 a Space odyssey ), sometimes its strange synth compositions and there's a guitar song that sounds like its from the Last of Us and its so distracting and out of place you cant help but feel someone edited it in the movie when the director wasn't paying attentionOscar Isaac and Natalie Portman both have great performances, Jennifer Jason and Tuva Novotny do as much as they can with their character, but everyone else is very forgettable, but given how little development their characters got you're not sure who's at fault there.I would still advise people to go watch this movie, if only for the great visuals and the admittedly fascinating ending. Based on the mixed reviews its a love it or hate it movie, i certainly didn't love it but some might. Just don't go in with high expectations like i did.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not what it could have been,"This film is not what it could have been or was trying to be, that much is clear. Fortunately some awe-inspiring effects and a wave of energy towards the end keeps it from being a real stinker, but the problems remain. What problems? You could call it ground-breaking to cast a bunch of actresses in the traditionally male roles of a team of scientists and explorers checking out an unexplainable phenomenon, but in this case you could also call it boring and unbelievable. There is zero chemistry between the romantic leads (Portman and Isaac) and Portman seems pretty detached throughout. She and her team are called on to inspect some sort of anomaly (the shimmer) that appears to rewrite the genes of animals and do other weird things. The movie is clearly influenced by J.G. Ballard's weird phenomena stories, SF horror flicks, and especially by Tarkovsky's ""Stalker.""

A good performance from Natalie Portman helps to keep the story interesting and Jennifer Jason Leigh is impressive - her part as the psychologist was good casting. The strange mind-bending mystery, and the creatures and action along the way keep up the tension quite well but it is the production design and cinematography which sustain the viewer's interest.

This is a movie I've been looking forward to especially since it's directed by Alex Garland , the guy who gave us ex machina. The movie stars Natalie Portman and oscaar Isaac and it's about a small biome causing changes in nature. And getting closer to what's causing it and why ?. makes this slow movie interesting. This movie had some great acting and screenplay. This movie has a couple of monsters prowling around and has very predictable jump scare moments and some scenes gave off the vibe of a b grade horror movie , they should've worked on that. Depsite being creepy , dark and weird. This movie is nothing less than ex machina and a really good mindbender right beside arrival .

This is not going to be a cult classic, there is much more outstanding sci fi out there, this is Hollywood rub ish at its worst.

Gorgeously Terrifying,"Once again, I have to reinforce how much I love original science fiction films. Yes, Alex Garland apparently took some liberties with the source material, but the feeling I had watching Annihilation was unlike anything I have had in quite some time, perhaps since seeing Interstellar in 2014. The wide range of tone and emotion this movie can display is unbelievable. I went from being invested in the intellectual elements of this sci-fi feature, to beyond terrified of the creatures that inhabit ""The Shimmer"", to fascinated by the mind-blowing choices the film makes in the third act. In every sense, Annihilation is a unique piece of art.The main story thread sees Natalie Portman's 'Lena' team with Dr. Ventress (Jennifer Jason leigh), Anya (Gina Rodriguez), Sheppard (Tuva Novotny), and Josie (Tessa Thompson) in an attempt to figure out why no human life form seems to come back after visiting The Shimmer. It's both a science fiction adventure film, as well as a psychological horror/thriller. All genres are equally as compelling to see play out here.While it can be a slow moving film at times, its methodical pace plays into the epicness of the ending in my opinion. You may not be as impressed or as shocked by the events of the third act if you don't get a confusingly plodding first hour and a half. And I say that in the most affectionate way possible. I don't like building up the suspense or anticipation for a film to people who haven't seen it, but it's worth noting that I'm still buzzing after it's been 5 days.There's no sense in trying to explain some of the events of the film or what it means, considering I myself am still trying to figure out beat for beat, and it's better to go into this film completely blind, as I mostly did. However, I can say that the performances (by an all female lead cast) are terrific, the special and practical effects are terrifying and beautiful, and the direction is brave. From a science fiction perspective, you can't really ask for any more than that.9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Neither a masterpiece nor a complete disaster,"Movies like these really frustrate me. In fact they infuriate me. In terms or atmoshpere, tone and the subject matter Annihilation is the kind of movie that is rarely released as studios now generally prefer to play safe with dumbed down Popcorn Sci Fi. Hollywood now typically sticks in some action, explosions and a few comic relief gags, tries to appeal to a broad base of viewers and release yet another crummy cookie cutter 'sci fi' movie.I don't mind slow, moody movies especially if they make you think outside of the box and make you uncomfortable. Annihilation definitely fits that bill.Where everything comes apart at the seams is the continuous stupidity shown by nearly all the major characters. It's difficult to really get into a movie when you're exclaiming ""why on earth are they doing that?"" for the 50th time the first of which being why on earth were the most unhinged people posible being chosen to confront one of the biggest threats the planet has ever faced?Others have listed the string of stupidities in Annihilation so I won't list them yet again..

A cerebral and visually striking thriller,"In order to enjoy this movie, you must enjoy/appreciate movies that do not explain everything, and that leaves the audience to ponder what the heck they just saw. You must also like sci-fi, thrillers, and have at least a small taste for horror. Those who enjoy this movie possibly also enjoyed (or would enjoy) movies like Gone Girl, 10 Cloverfield Lane, Jurassic Park, Arrival, The Thing, Sphere, Interstellar, Prometheus, and of course, Ex Machina.Annihilation is a film based off a novel by Jeff VanderMeer. It's about a woman searching for answers when her husband mysteriously reappears after going missing during a classified military operation. A biologist, she enters with a small team of women into a world created on our own by what appears to be a fallen meteoroid. This world defies logical biology in quite fascinating, and horrifying ways. So many questions need answering, such as: What is it? What is it doing? What are the effects on the environment? On humans? And while some questions are answered, others appear to be unanswered, or at least, answered cryptically. Admittingly, I myself am still confused about a few plot points of the film, but it's exciting to think about it and discuss with others.It is quite bizarre, and the cinematography is quite stunning and beautiful. Acting is nothing special, nor is it bland. The basic ingredients for an effective and entertaining film are met here, with no major complaints. It's quite different, those worried about predictability shouldn't be worried.It can get intense. Those who say it's ""boring"" must be impossible to please. Personally, I've seen so many horror movies I have thought I was too desensitized to be ""scared"" anymore, but I found myself absentmindedly tearing apart my lower lip in trepidation by the events on screen. Sure it may have some slower parts, but let's be honest, what movie DOESN'T have slow parts? In these scenes, situations are discussed, discoveries are made, mysteries are explained, and tension is prepped. There really are no dull moments, and the movie keeps you wondering throughout.It's a fun, exhilarating film. I imagine most who see it would walk away satisfied, but if you hated every movie above that I compared it to, you should probably skip this one. Which is a shame.

An interesting premise told with reasonable imagination and delivered with considerable visual flair. A brave attempt at high-concept and cerebral SF mixed with some strong horror violence; moderately successful. Interesting atmosphere and quite 'trippy' though let down a little by a rather formulaic tale-sting. Certainly far better than 95% of what is passed off as speculative fiction in film.

Beyond a terrible adaptation,"It seems Alex Garland self-admittedly decided to take the concept of an adaptation very loosely, apparently only reading the first book the film is based on (which is part of a trilogy) once, and allegedly, writing the screenplay from his memory, 'like a dream.'Now I don't want this review to be about how the film compares to the book, everyone hates that. It is a given that a film is going to be different from the book, it always will be and that's fine - and that was clearly the intention here. Besides, the book itself is a real challenge to adapt, and Garland probably saw it that way, hence his decision to depart from the source material as much as possible.The problem is that, unfortunately, the result is absolutely awful nonetheless.Let me try to summarize the premise without spoiling too much:
Natalie Portman joins a scientific expedition in an area that has been quarantined for the past three years, from which nobody has ever returned, with the exception of her husband, who seems to have lost all his memories of his time there.
As she begins to explore said area, she quickly discovers that the laws of physics seem to have changed there, and that the environment is hostile to human life.That is a very great premise with a ton of potential for a thrilling movie.
Somehow, it seems Alex Garland thought that he would use his fifty-five million dollar budget to make his own version of 2001, but sadly, he failed at that too.
The first half hour of the film meanders in pointless exposition scenes and excruciating attempts to make us care about any of the characters. Natalie Portman focuses all her attention on looking tough and depressed, which only succeeds at alienating us from her completely.By the time the expedition into Area X begins, we have already completely lost interest in the film. Yet it goes from bad to worse. I expected the story to at least gain some momentum once the expedition would start, but instead, Garland chose to continually slow everything down with pointless flashbacks of more of what already turned the first act into a borefest.But not only is the second act as boring as the first act, which in itself is a significant achievement, it also turns out to abandon any form of logic or character development.
Under the pretext that the members of the expedition are supposed to 'go crazy,' Alex Garland lazily makes them do whatever he wants them to in order to serve his otherwise completely bland and uninspired plot.
The characters go from place to place without any logic or reason in a very Blade Runner 2049 fashion just to fill out the space while no tension is built or additional information really given.
Characters continually spout out exposition based on rough observations they make on the spot - to a degree that is laughable by anyone who has ever opened the most basic science book in their life.The main thread is also continuously interrupted by an interrogation scene that adds absolutely nothing to the movie, except additional overexplanations of what is happening that are already pretty heavy handedly over explained by the characters going through it - I wish I could quote some of the most awful lines, however, without context, they wouldn't make any sense, but let me just state that the film contains some of the most horrible dialogue I have heard in recent years, and there has been plenty of horrible dialogue in recent years.Eventually, we reach a third act that is simply as flat as the previous two, but turns into a pseudo psychedelic 2001 inspired sequence at some point that is supposed to inspire awe and wonder in its audience, but can only generate contempt or at the very least, mockery, whether it is with the pathetic CGI that makes the movie look like an episode of Quantum Leap or Sliders, or the ridiculous concept it is trying to represent which essentially feels like a 3rd grade summary of philosophy for dummies.Fascinatingly, nothing saves this movie in any way. The already terrible cinematography is constantly worsened by awful looking CGI flares that attempt to create an eerie atmosphere and instead constantly remind the audience that, yes, there is CGI everywhere. And then, Natalie Portman really struggles to bring any life to her performance, and one can't really blame her for it either: what could she possibly do when her character is written so superficially, when there is nothing human about who she is supposed to embody? The same goes for the supporting cast, which is as robotic as Ava was in Ex-Machina. Except that, this time, it shouldn't be that way.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Break it up folks. Show's over, nothing left to see here.","It's been said that the only legitimate philosophical question is in the form of ""Why is there something instead of nothing?"" Annihilation reverses the two subjects of that question.I don't mean to dismiss anyone's experience in watching the film, but I found nothing intellectually challenging about either the story or the interpersonal exchanges among and between the characters. The scientific revelations that some of the characters offer are earth-shattering only if you aren't possessed by an imagination that allows for the existence of other forms of life. Even their hypotheses were dull. And you don't need to be a biologist to figure out what's different about what's going on within the alien forest (the writers call it ""the shimmer"") in comparison to everyday, carbon-based existence. I won't give my explanation here since it may be one of a few mundane mysteries in a disappointing script.The narrative is both uninspired and uninspiring, and the writers provide ample opportunity to stop caring about the story and the characters. Unfortunately, this spills over into the ending which steered viewers to ask ourselves a limited set of questions about what may have happened. At least those of us who were still interested enough to care. I also had the dreaded ""embarrassed-for-someone-else"" experience more than once, both for a meandering story that seems satisfied to make halfhearted attempts at being interesting and the portrayal of a land that was too often straining to be different in ways that might move viewers to be left in awe. Never happened.CGI and special effects are bland; nothing new to see here that hasn't already been portrayed (badly) in TV sci-fi series. A walk through a rain forest is more visually compelling, even if taken on National Geographic. The alien world that's presented evokes images of a darker though ultimately lackluster Walt Disney World in a sometimes cartoonish way rather than shuttling back and forth through the multiple levels of Being in Interstellar. It represents a different reality as a blunt object in a world that cries out in desperation for a finer, simpler touch. What's supposed to be frightening is too often unwittingly comical; the gravity of the mission and the vulnerability of the characters lose their narrative force as a result. (If you haven't seen it, check out The Forbidden Planet -- a film released more than sixty years ago -- for its compelling narrative and limited but, within the context of the story, realistic special effects.)Annihilation is not worth seeing, even if you have MoviePass. Not a single ""ooh"" or ""aah"" throughout though there was some intermittent and well-earned laughter along the way. I doubt that Annihilation will show up on a ""One Hundred Underrated Sci-Fi Movies from Twenty Years Ago"" list. There just isn't very much to it.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

If you look at the past reviews of all the people that are trashing this for being ""illogical"", ""pretentious"", ""nonsensical"", and various petty picking apart at irrelevant technical details of this movie that they seem to be subjecting to documentary standards for some reason, some of their highest rated sci-f/fantasy movies are as follows: Guardians of the Galaxy, Mute, Star Wars, Bright, and so on (One of them has even reviewed THE EMOJI MOVIE twice as high).You kids can ignore the completely made up science in Star Wars because there's a bunch of shiny space battles distracting you, and even delude yourself into thinking that objectively poorly constructed messes like Mute and Bright are ok, but you take personal offense at silly garbage like the contents of the character's backpacks and the lack of plausibility and realistic physics in a completely fictional phenomenon here? Wow, the stench of cognitive dissonance is overpowering.Gee, but maybe if you fill your reviews up with overused smart-sounding buzzwords like ""pretentious"" then we'll all think it's the movies fault and not that you just have short attention spans and a severe lack of imagination, and maybe no one will notice your histories of giving free passes to other movies that have much more serious issues because they had SPLOSIONS!",,Anonymous,Horror

"Not as good as promised, or should have been. Blame Portman.","I have to admit the trailer had gotton me quite curious to see this one but now having seen it... well sad to say it didn't quite meet expectations. And despite it's beauty, and relatively original plot idea it's basic problem is Natalie Portman and her character.I'm sure having a girl who's been in the military for 8 years and then studied to become a PHD professor in Biology looks good on the writers desk but it's a long stretch to believe when Portman (who still looks about 25) is cast to play the role. But more to the point, Portman, endowed with her Chanel cheekbones and 8 stone frame, looks and is hopelessly out of place in the role, struggling to carry the weight of her M16 and rucksack around the jungle.Sections of genuinely interesting script and moviemaking are interrupted by inane girly shouting matches and screaming which seem only placed to satisfy studio bosses' idea of ""horror"" but the quieter, more thoughtful sections as they unravel the bio-monstrosity of the shimmer were actually really great.Similarly Jennifer Jason Leigh, a tremendous actress who usually lifts any movie, just grunts and whispers all the way through with a fairly hollow character with not much to really with or do. She's supposed to be the leader of the team, but the director sadly devotes all available screentime to the expensive Portman.On balance, not a bad film (at least no capes for a change) but an opportunity not fully grabbed. Portman needs to stick to playing pretty girls, as ex-military tough lasses just ain't her, either physically or emotionally. The film, whilst pretty, feels like a cross between the Hunger Games and Apocalypse Now, but without the drama or tension of either of those movies. But keep it up Alex Garland, your next one will hopefully be better.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's not trying to be anything,"I don't usually do movie reviews, but I watch Ralph Sepie, so I'm an expert now. I'll go for as spoil free as I can though hints might accidentally be passed thru.From the production standpoint, I think they wanted a movie half-realism, half-Avatar. It probably looked incredible in a iMax/3D theater. You don't get that full experience unless you have a proper theater set up.From the acting standpoint, everyone worked around Natalie Portman. She was the centerpiece. The actors around her have proved themselves in other projects so I think they were good. Oscar Isaac is simply one of the best talents and it's really good he was in it. If not, the movie may have suffered quite a bit. Portman did great with having to deal with both facial acting and funny body movements.I was afraid 1/3 of the way thru this may end up like Contact. It didn't. The source material was better, the pacing, Portman is better than Foster, etc...I've seen some reviewers wanted this to be Aliens or The Terminator for some reason. Have guns a blazing! That's not this film (though there is action).The best part of the film: the suspense. By leaving the audience uneasy about not knowing what's going on plays into what the director wanted. This can be construed as ""pretentious."" I try avoiding that label for the truly pretentious. I'm looking at you Requiem for a Dream. The uneasiness of the film was similar to 2001: A Space Odyssey. Obviously this wasn't directed by Kubrick, but definitely Kurbrick inspired.The worst part: the dialogues. Many lines didn't feel natural to what a normal person would say. Sometimes less is more. They could have learned from The Larry Sanders Show of minimalism. If dialogue can be replaced with body language, then omit the lines.The themes of the movie is why you have the love it or hate it phenomenon. I think the director wanted a 2001 feel, so the themes are murky. I don't think the film was trying to be known as the thought provoking movie of the year. But it could have done better. The first lines of the movie was explaining how abiogenesis is one of the big unknowns. If pondering abiogenesis and possibly natural selection is thought provoking, then this film might be for you. Outside of that, possibe themes of destroying things humans don't understand, the purpose of life of either fighting/fear/acceptance, and questioning what it means to be sentient are present. How much in depth is up to the viewer.In summation: Annihilation is an ambitious film. It has a star studded cast and amazing visuals. The film wasn't trying to be inventing the wheel, but it far from being a hack job. For those wanting a non military SciFi film, then give this a chance. Sometimes, a movie isn't trying to be something more than a movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Astonishing sci-fi movie!,"I would recommend this movie to everyone else. The movie contains complex story line and gives a hint about the creation of the life.

The visuals are absolutely breathtaking, however, and those final 20 minutes or so are pretty mind-blowing, owing its inspiration to sci-fi classics like2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)andAlien (1979).

An interesting but ultimately unsatisfying (or maybe astoundingly satisfying) spectacle,"""Almost makes sense"". The movie has the almost-making-sense feel of Russian sci-fi movies like 'Stalker' and 'Solaris'. If you even remotely like this movie, you will truly love the 1979 Russian sci-fi movie 'Stalker' which attempts the same things as 'Annulation', but actually succeeds. 
 
""Soggy Middle"". The first act is the best. Its intriguing and really gets you engaged with the story and the main character. The third act is mediocre (or maybe great), if somewhat ambiguous. Where this movie really drags is the second act. There are some really weird and beautiful effects; as well as many suspenseful horror-like sequences. However, this exploration of the mysterious Area X and the motivations of the characters is too slow and drawn out. I found I had way too much time to speculate about why the people in-charge of the Southern Reach were so incredibly inept at exploring this strange region. As the act was playing out, I came up with about two dozen strategies for accomplishing the same goals without sending people on a crazy suicide mission.The most interesting part was the exploration of the main character's reasons for undertaking such a risky mission. As the act progresses, we gradually learn the truth and the secrets which underlie her part of the story. All of this is given far too little attention and is not properly woven into the 'exploration' theme of the rest of the movie.""An ambiguous third act"". The conclusion of the movie is either rather mundane and unsatisfying or truly great and interesting. It all depends upon what actually happens. This is the one part of the movie I would watch again if it didn't involve sitting through the middle. I won't spoil the ending by writing any more except to suggest you watch very very closely. Does what 'appears' to happen actually happen or does its opposite?If the movie ends the way it appears at first glance, then the result is rather unsatisfying. If the opposite happened, then the ending has a whole different interpretation which completely changes who can be considered 'the winners' and 'the losers' in this exchange. Maybe a detailed dissection will reveal the answer once the movie comes out on digital. It would have been better, though, had the filmmaker made things clear on the first viewing. Ideally you want to get the central meaning on the first go and additional layers from subsequent passes.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"This is Sci-Fi to love, especially on the big screen","Rarely do I run into a film that transports me to pondering the universe in ways that both fascinate and terrorize me in equal measures. ""Annihilation"" manages to create a threat to Earth that is both beautiful and intoxicating to watch and yet frightening as hell at the same time, and I loved every moment of it. I'm a huge ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" fan from way back, and ""Annihilation"" managed to hit the same buttons of pleasurable universe-pondering and just plain popcorn-flick big-screen movie theater entertainment joy without being a copy of ""2001."" (This is definitely a film to see on the biggest screen with the best sound system you can find, by the way). I thought the cast here was perfect, the story, tone and pacing perfect, the special effects perfect, and the sheer audacity of the ending section literally mesmerizing (I was attracted and repelled in equal amounts, and couldn't take my eyes off the screen even though at times I wanted to because it was so effectively freaking me out). Likely for sci-fi fans only, and even then it will have those fans arguing its merits--which I think makes it even better!

It is all there, but somehow does not mix to something greater.One may wonder if this is because finally the experience of the ""smart phone"", to live most things through little screen with bad sound, determines the aesthetics of media creation.

"Alex Garland conjures up yet another strangely beautiful sci-fi epic. Though, I must say, I enjoyed 'Ex-Machina' more! [+71%]","As is the case with most Alex Garland films (when I say films, I'm referring to the films he has written - 'Ex-machina' is the only other movie he has directed so far) such as '28 Days Later', 'Sunshine', ' and 'Dredd', his latest directorial venture 'Annihilation' also treads the 'sci-fi-with-a-message' path. He narrates stories in which visibly strong (but intrinsically weak) characters try to deal with the existence of alternate realities. While Garland follows the same skeletal structure in 'Annihilation' as well, the film still manages to maintain its singularity.The film is told from the point-of-view of Lena (played by a nuanced Natalie Portman), a biologist (with a militaristic past) who signs up for a covert expedition into an otherworldly zone (known as 'The Shimmer' where laws of nature are seemingly twisted. Lena has her own reasons to partake in this quest, which ultimately leads to bizarre findings that blur the lines between real and surreal.What the viewers are in store for, isn't a straightforward sci-fi flick where answers are served on a silver platter. A lot is left to the judgment of the viewers - they can comprehend the proceedings however they feel like. This brain-teaser of a movie barely resorts to compromises in storytelling and leaves viewers to determine the solutions using their own interpretive thinking skills.The visuals by Rob Hardy are complemented well by the terrifying visual effects by 'Double Negative' a.k.a DNeg. Dangers arrive in the form of mutated alligators and bears and trust me when I say they're not pleasing to look at. The musical score by Ben Salisbury and Geoff Barrow subtly signify the eerie tone of the film. Natalie Portman carries her 'bewildered biologist' character with ease, while J.J Leigh as Dr. Ventress (the leader of the expedition) puts up a convincing show. Oscar Isaac shines (as always!), in a sort-of extended cameo.Verdict: Give 'Annihilation' a watch if you relish ambiguity in films!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
An Extremely Loose Adaptation of the Book,"As a person who had read (and is a big fan of) the book, I felt torn. If you have not read the book, go ahead and see the movie. The production design is remarkable, the actors are truly great, the scores are harrowing and on point; all in all, as a movie alone, it's an excellent movie.But, if you've read Vandermeer's book, you would probably dislike or even hate the movie (as I do). Alex Garland was one of my favorite directors, and I couldn't wait to see this movie after hearing that he will be making the adaptation of the novel. And now I don't know what to believe anymore.It's basically him saying to VanderMeer ""I love your book and I'm going to make a movie based on it. But let me change this... and this... and this... You know what? Screw the book. I'm going to make my own watered-down version of it. The book is going to be a trilogy? Nah, one is good.""Some movies are loose adaptations of some books. But I've never seen one that is as drastic as this one. Understandably, it's a highly unfilmable book (How? Read it and you'll understand.) But if it's going to be a very loose adaptation, don't use the same title as the book maybe?On top of that, there's the issue with distributing the movie, with all the Paramount and Netflix things making the movie unavailable in theatres outside of the US.I'm not really sure how much the rating should be. I wanted to like it, but I couldn't. Not after knowing that the book is so much more enticing, suspenseful, and poetic.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Refreshing atmospheric sci-fi story.,"After a week of watching nothing else than stinkers I finally got to watch a movie that I liked. I wouldn't put Annihilation in the horror genre but in the science fiction instead because that's where it really belongs. A well filmed story with good visual effects. A story that was for once completely new and refreshing, and not the usual stories we watched over and over again. The soundtrack gave the whole movie a weird atmospheric ambiance, sometimes a bit creepy, and that was a very good move in this movie. The cast was also well chosen, nothing bad to say about anybody. Apparently some reviewers want some logic when they watch a sci-fi, and that's the proof they should just not watch sci-fi's and just stick to drama's. Annihilation might not be everybody's cup of tea but it for sure is mine.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good-looking hull with superb acting but no content.,"After seeing the Teaser Trailer for Annihilation last year I was very intrigued. I like almost everything Sci-Fi and figured it could be a more intellectual and philosophical ride than usual. So I went to buy the book-trilogy by VanderMeer and started reading to prepare for it. I don't regret that part, having never stumbled upon any of Jeff VanderMeer's work before. The books are weird, creepy and also pretty clever and special compared to other Sci-Fi I read. I felt like VanderMeer clearly outsmarts most readers.
Hearing that Alex Garland only read the first novel of the trilogy and then came up with a movie on his own had me not only sceptical but made me not rush the reading aswell. So far I'm done with book two.
Garlands Ex-Machina was great, I loved it despite some story-telling flaws. What he did with Annihilation made me angry after having read the books. I don't know if it's ignorance or arrogance but except for the very core idea of the book, he seemed to not care at all about the material.
There's an area that has a shimmer around it and manages to change physical laws and completely morphs preset dna together with other things. That's pretty much all Garland took from the book. The rest is from his own mind. No dialogue or scene have anything to do with the book from there on. The protagonists actually had to tell the audience they're getting crazy because the scenes didn't picture it well enough to see.
The acting was great, especially from Natalie Portmann and Tessa Thompson (underrated but will get there I hope. I managed to stumble upon most of her work since Veronica Mars). The setting reminded me of the videogame The Last of Us but not of the books from VanderMeer. Still beautiful though. (Heck if Garland made a movie of the game with that setting it could have been awesome).
Watching the movie as standalone without the novels it got adapted from, it still makes for a very murky experience, due to lack of backstory about the travel into Area X and the lack of motivation from the protagonists. Also, the eerie background-sounds were great. The guitar-songs in some scenes felt completely out of place for the setting.
Therefore my rating is 6, because of the cinematography and the very good acting overall.
After seeing the movie on netflix, I can see why Paramount decided to not drop it in cinemas outside the US and China. It was not worth it and I am still sour about that fact. I am not looking forward to Garlands next work like I did after Ex-Machina.
If you like Sci-Fi and haven't read VanderMeer's Southern Reach Trilogy, give it a try. You won't be disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A journey into the mind.,"Annihilation is based on Carl Jung's Depth Psychology - specifically his 'Red Book' which was an experiment of intense introspection into his own psyche. Without an understanding of the themes expressed in Jung's work (e.g. ego, conscious and unconscious mind, collective unconscious, shadow self, archetypes etc), this movie won't make much sense. It certainly makes sense if you understand the psychological framework it operates within.We follow Lena into the depths of her own mind and if you didn't 'get it' - it's because you don't get Jungian Psychology (presumably this is what the studios meant when they said the film was ''too intellectual'').",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
I was expecting more from Garland,"I hoped Alex Garland would have put another gem in his career, but this isn't a movie to remember at all. It's not THAT bad, ok, that's why it's getting a 6/10 from me, and I like the main idea. But when you reach the end, it all falls to pieces. It should have been longer, taking its time to explain something that could have been interesting, increasing the mysterious aura that makes you continue watching it. If you're a sci-fi addict, watch it anyway, maybe focusing on the few good things and closing both eyes on the bad ones :).

"A Slow, Yet Powerful Story","Writer/director Alex Garland has been in the game for quite some time. Writing fantastic movies like 28 Days Later and Sunshine, his knack for filmmaking has always been present but was taken to another level in 2014 when he wrote and directed his first feature film in Ex Machina.Being one of my favorite films of that year, I found myself extremely excited for his next directed project. Annihilation has just hit theatres and if you're not someone who enjoys a slow burn in order to reach a worthy payoff, then this movie may not be for you. If you're up for anything and can embrace any sort of sci-fi story, then here's why I think you'll probably end up loving this movie as much as I did.Going into detail about the plot of this film would truthfully ruin it, so I'm going to explain this premise as simple as I possibly can. After having to deal with a tragic personal incident, Lena tasks herself with a group of women who plan to enter a forcefield area that has been created after a meteor has hit.Learning that they may not all come out alive, they strive forward to find the answers. Yes, that sounds very vague, but it's hard to talk about this movie to someone who hasn't seen it. For a premise like this, you need a few key things to make it work; A great screenplay, a great cast, and a nice through-line of direction to hold the movie together.Annihilation is a film that places its characters first before anything else, and while that definitely works in its favor, if the story surrounding them doesn't work then the overall film will fall pretty flat.Although it takes itself very seriously and many of the scenes are very slow-paced, you can tell that Garland has created a film that will slowly reveal itself as it goes along, providing insight into the backstory of each character as well as providing answers as who what exactly they're trying to uncover. Flashing back and forth between the past and the future, answers are given at the most opportune times in order to benefit the film.Natalie Portman remains a powerhouse when it comes to dramatic performances. I've always been a fan of her in pretty much any dramatic role and this one was no exception. That being said, she's not the only one who shines here.From Gina Rodriguez to Tessa Thompson, each of the supporting members seemed to have their time to shine and certain inciting moments had me on the edge of my seat. There are some truly thrilling moments sprinkled throughout this movie and I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next. I know I'm a sucker for great sci-fi films, but this is just another one to add to the list.In the end, while I can't say everyone will love this movie because I'd be lying if I did, I believe that everyone can at least admire the attempt at being different and unique from most mainstream movies out there today. Annihilation takes risks and doesn't give itself up to a generic conclusion. It chooses to be different from most films and never lets its foot off that peddle. Wonderfully directed, very well-written, and beautiful to look at, I can't really come up with any huge complaints.Yes, some will complain about the pacing and few may even complain about it being too bizarre in its final act, but I found these aspects to be a great addition. Annihilation is a fantastic movie and I wouldn't be surprised if this film ends up in my discussion for best films of 2018 at the end of the year. The year is still very young, but I can't recommend this movie enough. Go in with an open mind and you may just love it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Well-shot and effectively suspenseful,"Lots of chilling scenes helped by great direction and cinematography. It didn't surprise me when I learnt later that the director is also behind Ex Machina. The dialogue is both good and awful at different spots.

Empty and lost,"The vast range of responses to a film like this is fascinating. It must reflect the many different ways we all use film entertainment. For example, I love science fiction, and am always willing to suspend disbelief, but to me 'Westworld' is based on a ludicrous premise, has no real heart, and manifestly rushes round during the last couple of episodes desperately inventing unbelievable fixes and switches to the plot to get it to work.
But the imagery is wonderful, and apparently to many loyal viewers this more than makes up for it's other shortcomings ..
Similarly, 'Annihilation' looks like a significant film, talks like a significant film but in the end is nothing more than a rather tedious exercise in beautiful CGI and pseudo philosophy. But the scary stuff ( weird beasts that have skulls instead of real heads, writhing things in people's stomachs etc,) are randomly plucked from the well established horror movie playbook.

There are a lot of movies like that... it does not mean it is not good.The female characthers are great, the leading actor and actress do a good job, and I believe Natalie Portman portrays some nice depth and intensity to a characther that probably didn't need, but elevated the personal expegrience...I recommend you go watch - the one thing you may end realizing is that this movie is ultimatelly about inner reflection about the oposite of ourselves.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Both unnerving and soothing.,"I almost didn't watch this film but I am glad I did. I am not usually into sci-fi but it appeared under the horror category on Netflix and I've always liked Natalie Portman so I figured I'd give it a go.Within the first ten minutes I suspected it might end with it all being 'just a dream' or all some grand metaphor for Portman's mental state and I'm not sure I was entirely wrong to assume that. I'm also not sure if I am just stupid and don't understand the true artistic depth of the film or if I am thinking way too deeply into it. However, I think it is one of those movies that everyone looks up an explanation for after they leave and are left to come to their own conclusions.I did like how the source of scariness came from the unknown, the beauty of nature and the mundane. I also found it interesting how classic horror tropes such as the 'final girl', 'clones' and 'found footage' are appropriated and reinvented. Similarly, the merging of genres including psych-thriller, sci-fi, fantasy, romance and drama are combined to tear the viewer between a false sense of security and an underlying sense of suspense. I think this also emphasises the importance of paradox and balance throughout the film.This is an enjoyable film with an interesting concept only let down by its ambiguousness and questionable science.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Worst movie I've seen in 10 years.,"I never do reviews, but this movie was so bad I feel obligated to warn people.

The acting, particularly Portman was abysmal. Why she gets these roles is beyond me. She is a terrible actor. What gets annihilated is the desire to see future movies because this kind of refuse drains your will to enjoy films.

It Could Have Been a Masterwork,"Based on the experience watching it, I would have given ""Annihilation"" 8 or even 9 stars. But based on the many things where this movie fails, I can't give more than six stars.
Where it shines:
-Fantastic music and scenery
-Great Digital effects
-Atmosphere, sense of wonder
-Full of Tension, good pacing
Where it fails:
-Lacks any plausibility
-Making no sense at all
-Completely missing character development
For the positive attributes I feel no need to explain them, for the negative the following has to be said.
If you want to make a film that lasts in the audience's memory, you have to minimize the amount of ""suspension of disbelief"". If a movie is entirely constructed to fit the needs of the production and not the needs of the audience, something went wrong.
""Annihilition"", while utterly beautiful, haunting and fascinating, during its best moments, suffers of very unbelievable premises. Remember, there is an event that is unpreceded in history, and even today it would not be possible to hide a growing anomaly that huge for a year. Further, the idea to send a platoon of armed women into the anomaly, without the possibility to report their sightings directly, is completely ridiculous. Even, or just because there were other teams before, which did not return. Who wants to waste people ? You could keep sending teams, until the alien lifeform consumes a continent, with no success.
There should be countless other, much smarter options to get a picture of the situation, but of course we have to follow the dumbest of them for only dramatical purposes.
However, on the inside, there are some completely unnecessary violent encounters, which are only there to create fear and a kind of tense that should not have found its way into this movie. I did not take ""Annihilation"" for an ""Alien"" or ""Predator"" horror-action thriller, but more in a ""Solaris"" or ""Stalker"" direction. 
The idea of an experimenting nature, without any other primary purpose or a mindset like ours, is a great one, and executed properly, but only in fragments and in the end. I wonder if the movie wouldn't have benefitted from another thirty minutes of exploration and transformation. 
So, while everything could have been great with a bit more overthinking, ""Annihiliation"" only partially succeeds in being impressing. On top of it, it gives us only a bit of a definition for the main charcter, the others are only shadowly persons.
In the end, you may feel tricked, as you think you have seen a good movie, that is in truth not such a one.",,Anonymous,Horror

an amalgam marries a sui-generis brainwave with a less ground-breaking template,"The follow-up to his enterprising AI thriller EX MACHINA (2014), novelist-come-filmmaker Alex Garland's second feature arrives sequentially in cinema first, then to the Netflix platform, a unique distribution exigency borne out of the ongoing profit re-shuffling feeding frenzy between old guards and future norm, boisterously in the name of the art of cinema.ANNIHILATION, an adaptation from the first novel of Jeff VanderMeer's awards-reaping SOUTHERN REACH trilogy, structures its narrative in the time-honored trope of an (all-women) expedition team entering a terra incognita shrouded by extraterrestrial might (aka. The Shimmer, a slowly expanding electromagnetic field hitting our planet like a bolt out of blue), coming in for both extrinsic and internecine perils, until the last remaining human contending with the cosmic unknown and metaphysical transformation against all odds, and is furnished with an open-ended coda to mine the seed for a possible sequel (that uroboros tattoo is repeatedly flagged up to elicit piquant fan theories).But conceptually, ANNIHILATION upholds an invigorating idea of random DNA synapsis in its core, catalyzed by the improbable phenomenon of prismatic refraction, and substantially surmises a possibility that the highly intelligent alien life form could be also flexibly amorphous, and it messes up all DNAs within its territory, knocking out animal/plant hybrids through haphazard genetic splicing and mutation, all the way to a physical replication of our doughty heroine, the biologist Lena (Portman, a relentless standard-bearer of true grits), which seemly consummates its nefarious mission of infiltration with a scorched-earth annihilation appearing more baffling than its scientific info-dump in the words from the physicist Josie Radek (a scare-easy Tessa Thompson), prior to her philosophical acceptance of her own botanical transmogrification.As a Sci-Fi food-for-thought, the film wisely refrains from over-applying cheap jump-scares and unsightly shocking images to spook audience, and its SFX team fairly dreams up an unworldly biome with breathtaking futuristic grandeur and presents varicolored, cannibalized flora-and-fauna bricolage to handsome effect, albeit one might cavil that occasionally its hue feels solarized.Heralded by the psychologist Dr. Ventress (a peerlessly detached, unforthcoming Jennifer Jason Leigh), the forlorn-hope also including Anya Thorensen (Rodriguez, fraught with agonized paranoid in a fanatical about-face), a gay paramedic and the geomorphologist Cass Sheppard (Novotny), is composed with a quintet of damaged goods, each is scarred by the disenchantment of their respective lives, which points up a meta-reference of human's self-destructive frailty, that resounds with a tint of hard-earned poignance. Rounding out its female-fronted cast is a terrifically enigmatic Oscar Isaac as Kane, Lena's soldier husband, whose mystical return from the Shimmer after a nearly one-year-long disappearance is the stimulant of Lena's own involvement.On a whole, ANNIHILATION is a welcome expansion of our obsession with the mighty, unknown life force, an amalgam marries a sui-generis brainwave with a less ground-breaking template, moderately vamped up by a state-of-the-art mythical touch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Haunting, Visually Stunning Sci-Fi","There is something dreamlike about this entire movie. And that begins in the real world before the explorers enter 'The Shimmer'. This is Sci-Fi done right. There are more questions than answers and while there is a satisfying ending (with no sequel fishing, thank the Lord), the movie is designed to leave you wondering.I loved Garland's first effort, 'Ex Machina', and 'Annihilation' shows that film was no fluke. There's an underlying sadness to this movie. And I don't mind saying I didn't understand all of it, because we are not meant to understand it. What happens when you deal with an other world presence that doesn't think like a human? Well, probably human observation and analysis is going to be ineffective. We are left to work it out after the final credits role, which gives the movie resonance.The Shimmer is very surreal and the protagonists walking through it are borderline somnambulists trapped in It's dream. There's some stunning images here and luckily they weren't all spoiled in the trailers. Portman is great as the woman on a mission to find out what happened to her husband. The rest of the cast is top rate. The cinematography is dark and moody in it's interior shots and foggy and dreamlike with the exterior. It lends to a hypnotic feeling that really reinforces the fact that these woman are under the sway of forces far more powerful than themselves.I'm really looking forward to getting this movie on DVR. It's the type of film that invites repeated viewings. 'Annihilation' is definitely in the running for the best Sci-Fi film of the new millennium.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gorgeous Sober Sci-Fi Drama,"Alex Garland may not be a household name but film nerds know his name very well. This is the man who has created some excellent genre film in the past few years. He is the writer of such films as 28 Days Later, Dredd and Ex Machina which he also directed. When his name is attached to anything I get excited. When I heard about Annihilation, I did get excited. He was making original sci-fi with an outstanding cast. There's something about original ideas that makes me very stoked. I want more original films, especially sci-fi. It's one of my favorite genres. There are so many places to go with it. Garland is one person who I hope keeps coming up with fully developed original ideas because the film industry needs them. His latest endeavor, Annihilation is a layered movie that hits a lot of high points and a few low points.The film follows a biologist named Lena, played by Natalie Portman. She is grieving with the loss of her husband, Kane, Oscar Issac who went disappeared on a top secret military mission. When Kane shows up one day he's not the same. Lena can't get any answers from him. He has a medical emergency and on the way to the hosptial, the ambulance is stopped by vans in black. Lena wakes up in a military facility and explained that Kane was on a team that went on a mission to the odd zone and has been the only person to come back. Needing answers Lena joins the next mission into the Shimmer, an all-female team that features Jennifer Jason Leigh, Gina Rodriguez, Tuva Novotny, and Tessa Thompson. What they meet in the shimmer is something so expected and life-changing.This film is very much about dealing with loss and demons of all time. Each member of the mission has something they are overcoming or struggling with. Whether it be the loss of a family member, drug addiction, self-harm or guilty of past, each of our characters has something troubling them when they go into the shimmer. It makes for the film to have layers not just layers of the zone they have to go through but layers to their personalities and actions. The entire cast is very good. Portman may get the most screen time but Leigh, Rodriguez, and Thompson all shine. Garland seems to be very good at getting good performances out of his cast while telling a deeper story.This is thought-provoking sci-fi that answers some questions about what's going on in the film. But bigger questions are raised about humanity. That at times can slow the film down. Not in a negative way, but there is a lot to take in about the characters. Not just trying to figure out what the Shimmer is and how it is affecting the environment. Even though we don't spend as much time with each character as Lena, we are told through dialogue backstories and histories. There's a lot going on in this movie and I think it's a film to fully understand requires multiple viewings.Something it seems like Garland is now perfecting is visual in his film. Annihilation is beautifully shot with some vivid color schemes, excellent cinematography, and pretty wild special FX. The creatures in this film are nothing you've seen before. They very much evolve from the Shimmer and the atmosphere is at times its own character. This is a film definitely made for the big screen. No matter how large your TV screen is, I don't think it will do the film justice. For that, I give Garland all the credit because you can stop watching the film when it starts. As soon as the characters get to the Shimmer, we get to see the full extent of this sci-fi adventure mystery.I don't know what I expected the film to turn out to be. It definitely didn't see where it was going. I'm getting use to that with Garland films. Ex Machina is a film I could have predicted anything that was going to happen in that film. Annihilation is the same way. And that's a testament to the script. But there was something that just didn't hit me. I'm not sure if it was the small moments that slowed the film down. It could even be the ending that I expected some kind of big twist or a decent explanation. There was a twist but it's something that on re-watches is easily spotted. As I said earlier we are not given much explanation on the sci-fi elements in the film. The final moments of the film leave a lot to self-interpretation.Annihilation is visually stunning, thought-provoking and well acted. It just for me is missing something I can't explain. And it kind of falls apart for me in the last 10-15 minutes. I really love that Garland is going out and making original sci-fi, we as fans need more of it. I hope that he is given the chance to make more. I know this wasn't a huge hit but it seems like it's already making a cult status run. I suggest anyone who loves smart original sci-fi to check it out. At least that means that maybe the film industry will go out on a limb with original content instead of trying to make money on know IPs.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

I'm nearly annihilated maybe that's why I get it.....,"I think I get it better than those who have not been so close to death (several times).
In 5 years I lost my best friend, my health, two dogs and my husband to cancer...
Annihilation indeed.To me that is what this movie is about. {Yep the title sort of gives that away ;-)}The shimmer and wat it is/does is a huge malignant tumor to this planet.
Bam! Suddenly it is there and it changes everything in the gene-""order"" that we know and like to predict.
A future that can be foreseen is a safe one. One we can be at ease with. One that allows us to make plans and have projects.That is why we call it ""malignant"" because cancer cells do not play along with our game rules.
Our predictable future was nothing more than a mere illusion...The core-message of this film is the fact that it ethically and morally questions whether something is merely evil simply because it does not go according to our wishes?It certainly feels like that to the frustrated victim who's life projects are thwarted.
But that is a very subjective judgement of those who are or will be annihilated.In the greater scheme of things there is no objective parameter that can lead us to the conclusion that one way of cell evolution and growth is ""better"" than another...
It is merely a different way of doing things... Annihilating some and recreating others, always using the same base material, but in different ways. Taking and giving....This is why the movie gives viewers a ""tip"" by pointing out that aging is caused by a ""fault"" in our genes.
The above said is clarified in the discussion between Lina and Kane.
She states God made a mistake, erroring in gene evolution and thus causing us to grow old and die. Kane states God does not make mistakes....
She has a judgement purely based on her values.The movie's point of view is that genes are genes... No better or worse than others, an sich.
We disappear, but instead there are beautiful white dears running in the forest with flowers on their antlers.
""It's not destroying, it's making something new"" -Movie Quote from Lina's scriptTherefore, to me, this is not a horror movie or a sci fi flick but a philosophical movie. It questions our homocentric valuesystem, using our human race and our desires as standards of judgement.Buddhism already pointed out that this is not only an incorrect but also a frustrating and senseless thing to do, because we have no control.
And finding out game play rules that we like and of which we think they should be obeyed does not change a thing about the fact that we do not have control.So this is a movie that in essence questions our value systems, our homocentrism and our pathetic desire to regulate everything.I think that maybe having gone to the experience of enormous loss and having to learn to cope and to let go, made this theme somehow more comprehensible for me.
And in that state of mind I found that this was very beautifully depicted. Not an easy thing to do.I believe that the reason most people don't ""get it"" is due to the fact that we need the illusion of control, the lie of predictability to survive...
If we are not convinced to reach our pension, why buy a house, take a mortgage, have kids, and go to work every day to pay for all this?
We do this because we think only others die (young).
Yet every day there is someone who arranges his hair, paints her nails, puts on perfume, dresses up nicely, steps in a car to go to work, and dies within the next 45 min. for whatever reason imaginable... car crash, brain haemorrhage, 9/11.....People do not want to be confronted with that. It destroys there illusion of a safe, righteous and predictable world. That is why victims are often avoided. And probably why this movie is not appreciated.It apparently takes a nearly dead person to understand.But believe me the world as you know it will cease to exist!
Because of the simple reason that you will die, and thus will no longer be in it.
And this is inevitable.In other words: ""If you want to make God laugh tell him your plans!""

It tries to be more complicated than it actually is.,"I suppose this might just come down to personal preference but I personally find that Annihilation tries too hard to be overly intellectual/complicated, and I find it interesting how this seems to be a trend in cinema in recent times. If you think about how sci-fi movies were made decades ago, they were usually a lot more action oriented with a plot that is fairly obvious. You also had movies like Blade Runner for example which on the one hand is fairly cheesy as you'd expect from an 80s movie, but at the same time it has a deep thought provoking plot. There are even modern examples like Inception in the same way is deep thought provoking, and can even be somewhat complicated, but what I'm trying to explain here is that these movies don't try to be overly complicated. They have a plot which is easy to grasp and understand but at the same time has depth.The problem with movies like Annihilation is that it tries to use an underlying theme with which runs throughout, you're suppose to try and be intellectual and understand these themes and supposed metaphors in order to appreciate the plot and for it to provoke further discussion. Where I find this goes wrong for Annihilation is that I don't feel like the theme is particularly interesting or thought provoking, and whereas it may have worked if used more subtly as a side theme and for the rest of the movie to have a more solid plot, Annihilation commits fully to the theme which results in a bizarre and in my opinion pretty weak ending. In short what I mean is the movie tries to be more complicated than it actually is which in turn weakens the plot.Annihilation does contain some satisfying action sequences, horror, special effects and acting, all of which bring the quality of the movie up a notch. However I'm not particularly impressed with the directing, with too many slow sequences where nothing much happens to the point where it becomes a bit tedious to watch. It works in movies like 2001:A Space Odyssey where the setting and artistry of space welcomes the slow pace, and also Blade Runner does this well with beautiful stylised shots and an amazing soundtrack. Annihilation doesn't have these same qualities and therefore the slow pace just doesn't work. I mean sure some of the CGI looked pretty nice, but that doesn't mean I wanna watch a slow pan of the scene for 10 seconds if it has nothing else going for it.In conclusion, it's safe to say Annihilation isn't going to be a cult classic. It's merely a nod to a particular theme or set of themes running throughout humanity/society. If you fancy watching a bit of horror, and some decent suspense then you may enjoy the ride at least to some extent. However I think that's about all the movie has going for it, and so with a weak plot and poor directing it overall ranks low in my book.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A stunning direction and cast but very slow moving.,"Rating 3 out of 5 stars. (Fair)Annihilation is suppose to be a smart science fiction horror film with a sharp direction and a plot that has themes that the audience can discuss right after it ends. It is a fair film. The direction is sharp and done by Alex Garland, whose previous work was Ex Machina which was a great film that also had a theme in there. Annihilation is at times beautiful with its set pieces on a landscape were laws of nature does not really bide by the rules when it comes to mutation. The cast ensemble was also decent as well. It is not Alex Garland's best film, as this sci fi movie does require a lot of patience with its slow moving story.Lets talk about the pros about this film. Annihilation is definitely one of those films that audiences will either be liking or hating it. Especially with its plot. I do not want to give away much details or spoilers about it. Besides it is about a group of military scientists led by Jennifer Jason Leigh, Natalie Portman, Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson, and Tuva Novotny. They enter a mysterious zone known as Area X, were there is this force field wall called the shimmer. They enter it to locate the source and origin of this quarantined zone which seems to be growing. Once inside, they discover that landscapes and species mutations are beyond their imaginations. There is some creatures or cross breeding's with the animals. The plants are growing on an indifferent cycle as it evolves. But the scientists questions only remains about what happened to the previous several expeditions? Why has only one survivor from the previous expedition made it out? What is the purpose of the shimmer?The plot is mysterious and there is a twist that may throw the audience off course with the film. I like the twist. Sure, when it came to the third act of the movie, the climax was very trippy and visually stunning to look at. It is very unsettling and disturbing at the same time.The cast ensemble was great. Natalie Portman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson, and Tuva Novotny were great. Every one of there characters were not perfect and all had a connection of some kind on why they were chosen to enter the shimmer. Oscar Isaac's only had a short on screen time, mainly seen in flashbacks.The set design of the colorful plantation landscape was stunning. The visual effects were okay. Alex Garland unsettling direction was good too.What I did not like about the film. It is a slow moving film. You might even be asking yourself during it. If anything is going to happen at all. The group enters the shimmer, they are losing their awareness, and are traveling to get to the source of the shimmer. But going from one set piece to another and to stop and observe does go a long way. Nothing happens for most of the film until the climax. It does get boring. Then, there is flashbacks with Natalie Portman's character of her and her husband (Oscar Isaacs). Than the film flashes forward with Portman's character explaining the events in the shimmer. It does mess with the pace of the film and slow things down even more.I also felt like barely anything happened during most of the movie. The group come across a crocodile that has teeth like a shark. They come across mysterious plant life that is forming a shape of a standing person. And they see footage from the last expedition which may be disturbing. And than a giant sized mutated bear looking thing. But there was no suspense or thrills. I am sure the climax was suppose to be unsettling awe moment. But it was trippy and weird. But it missed the opportunity of being exciting.Overall, Annihilation is a fair science fiction film. The cast was good. The visual effects and set pieces were fun to look at. The direction and plot was sharp and driven with themes that may have people talking about. If you have the patience to sit through unnecessary flashbacks and its slow moving pace with nothing happening for a long running time. Than you may enjoy it.I will recommend the film as a rental, unless you're a huge fan of the sci fi genre and enjoy films like Arrival or 2001 Space Odyssey than I say see it in theatres.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

About cultural marxism and todays relativity,"True, when I was watching this it was just another horror sci-fi movie to me with cool effects.

I mean, people are saying that gender is fluid.. it's whatever. The art of our modern day looks like someone just took a dump on a lawn. It makes me think of the triptych painting ""The Garden of Earthly Delights"" by Bosch, painted around 1500. It shows humanity's three stages of birth, bloom and decay. In the decay parts looks just like this movie in a way where humans have morphed into whatever..I'll end this review with a quote (this is the internet after all):

So it has those elements it's not just a bunch of women going around shooting monsters, though you set get a fair amount of that it doesn't over saturates the movie. The design of the shimmer really does stand out for. The film it does really feel otherworldly. Nothing's in order abstract visuals , animals are evolved. During the day everything's bright and green. Lastly the characters overall they all do a good job Natalie character is compelling you can understand to her and the building with her and Oscar Isaac.

But - Jennifer Jadon Leigh couldn't have been made to look much worse, and her acting (directed?) was so flat, & her responsibilities didn't make much sense based on her character. What happened to her in the cave was soooo B movie that I nearly left. I thought no this movie was financed by the art director, special effects, CGI folks, who all did a fantastic job, so they'd have a vehicle for their work.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
as good as the book and that's saying something,"The book is one of the very few that has ever 'creeped me out', it has a famously 'foreboding' style in which nothing is ever explicit and yet you feel your skin crawl.The film would have to be 5 hours long to get close to the same atmosphere... so it has to cut corners and I think it does an extraordinary job by giving us 'foreboding' characters and a truly alien presenceweird, fantastic and grown up",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pardon,"181211: I remember seeing the trailers for this film and they intrigued me. Now, even after watching the move, I'm still intrigued...or perhaps it's just confusion? Perhaps I should just accept what I saw but instead I once again assume the writer(s) of this film had a message to relay and I just missed it? So, research will have to be done...if I get around to it. Unfortunately, Annihilation may not motivate me enough to do so. Some great action and special effects reside within. I don't regret the time so, for what it's worth, enjoy.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
annoying loopholes,"The thing with good Netflix movies is that they start fresh , with a new world ( Where is Monday , Bright ) or in this case , a possibility of one , then they build on the start and then there is the conclusion which doesn't answer much of the plot . so if you wanna watch a sci-fi with above features , go for it",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Hmm...,...is that kindof film that lets you keep it going. To put your imagination to the test. That kind of film that makes you ask yourself a question that leads to another question.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pretentious and plain boring.,"After watching it this film I was left wondering if I saw the same movie as the people praising it like it was already a contender for best film of 2018.This film is nothing but pretentious fake deep drivel, to some people it seems like a artistic achievement but in fact the only thing that is artistic is the visuals. This isn't a gallery it's a film and looking at this film critically you can easily see why it is so terrible.It is fillled with plot holes that puzzled me and my friends alike.
The characters are so bland and boring I didn't care if any of them died whatsoever in fact I was hoping they would so I would see something exciting instead of what was actually on screen.
You can see an attempt of making this film a beautiful deep think piece but in the end it just isn't. Not even close. The movie just falls flat on its boring face and you can see straight through all the artistic nonsense to see the movie for what it really is...GARBAGE.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Less than expected.,"I had fairly high expectations for this movie. The task forces sent into the shimmer were significantly unrealistic and the movie never feels like it reaches a rational conclusion, or even comes to any sense. Essentially the film tried very hard to be deep and mesmerizing, despite falling very short.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent Sci-Fi,"Writer/director Alex Garland has been in the game for quite some time. Writing fantastic movies like 28 Days Later and Sunshine, his knack for filmmaking has always been present but was taken to another level in 2014 when he wrote and directed his first feature film in Ex Machina. Annihilation will amaze you in a two-hour runtime, It is a refreshing cerebral sci fi ride with great visuals, cinematography and performances all around.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Too complicated meanings,"Good visuals, good plot, but the movie cannot show the meanings like the book does. Hard for audiences who don't read the book first to understand all the meanings of the end of the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not another group of Interstellar locusts!,"I had not seen a single trailer,commercial,or even a movie poster before seeing this movie...and I'm glad! Frankly I can't wrap my head around most of the negative reviews. I mean,to each their own I suppose,but it seems like a larger number than usual are reviewing this without having paid attention to it,at all.
 I keep seeing the term ""plot holes"" being thrown around like this is the only time they've come across them. Some reviews here clearly weren't paying any attention. ""Why an all woman team?"" Through conversation we learn that they had already sent Military,Non-Military,Scientists.Drones etc. By land,sea and air! The Dr.(Psychologist) even questions the very nature of it. Is it spiritual,alien?
 What I personally enjoyed about this was that we're talking about an infinite universe,with us humans understanding less than .01% of it...at best! Why is it people think we're so advanced that we will never encounter something we don't understand at all? That's what makes this movie interesting! Is it here to take over? Was it sent,as a sort of ""Terra-forming"" device? Is it even a life form at all?
 A great concept,good directing,good acting,enough budget and imagination to make it look really interesting, Even a good soundtrack. If you liked ""The Arrival"" you'll likely enjoy this,If you didn't,I'd suggest looking elsewhere.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's awful,"For those praising this movie, you are REALLY doing people a disservice by not warning them how dull and dumb the execution was. Frankly speaking it's for the colossally dumb to believe there is anything deeper in this muddy mess of a movie. And it practically dares the viewer to draw comparisons to better made versions of it.
Dull is being kind. There is no mystery and there is no payoff and you better heed what I'm telling you here, you will walk away wanting to put an icepick through your brain, because it also is a droning cesspool to the ears.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
