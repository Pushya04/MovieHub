"Very Entertaining, Funny, Pretty Original Story","This was a movie that, at the end, I thought ""Now that was an enjoyable 2 hours!"" I hate spending around $20 (not including baby-sitting $$) for my husband and myself to have that ""It was OK"" feeling.I think I like Will Smith better as a comedic actor than an action hero. He was well cast in this. His character was very likable, as was Kevin James'.There were several laugh out loud scenes. It's also a romantic movie, so guys, if you want to impress the lady in your life, take her to this. Women will like it as much as any chick-flick, but I wouldn't categorize this as one. There is plenty of guy humor in it for men to enjoy. I think that's one of the reasons why this movie is so perfect as a date movie. It has romance AND slapstick. I don't usually like slapstick that much, but it wasn't overdone and I can't think of any those scenes that didn't deliver laughs.I definitely recommend this movie. The first thing my husband said to me after it was over was ""I want to see it again!""",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very Entertaining,"This film was not about stereotypes, nor dance moves, nor pickup lines, really. This film was about the vulnerability of peoples' hearts. It was hard to believe that Kevin James could play in a convincing role, that Will Smith could satisfy without action, and that such a hackneyed genre of film could succeed in such a way. I don't intend to sound overly endeared with this film - it wasn't ""groundbreaking"" in any sort of way - but it was a film worth seeing. Was it believable? No. New York couldn't be so simple and there has been no human being in the history of mankind that has the ""hutzpah"" of Hitch. Sure, there are bar-studs, but not ones that can get any chick, at any time - excluding those raking in seven figures, of course. The thing that worked best for this film was its true focus on the dramatic side of things, not just on the comedy. It was a funny two hours, no doubt. But it was also two hours that made you sit in your seat, become immersed in the characters, and smile.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Has enough charming moments to make it worth going through the clichéd last third.,"""Hitch"" starts off well, with some genuinely good advice for men and their relationships and introduces to us the interesting characters. Basically the story is about Hitch (Will Smith), a man who knows all of the ropes when it comes to dating women, taking Albert (Kevin James) under his wing. Normally the guy would have as much chance of getting together with the apple of his eye (Amber Valletta as Allegra) as a skyscraper has of surviving a Godzilla attack, but Hitch is a real pro, so love might just be in the air.I never thought I'd say this but Kevin James is actually good in this movie. Will Smith is charming as usual, but the both of them really work together. There's chemistry between the actors and there are ample touching, funny and even romantic moments (well, not between James and Smith). When the two male leads are doing their comedic parts, the film is enjoyable and when it's being truthful, it feels genuine. What really hurts the movie is the last third of the running time. The story was deliberately avoiding the usual tropes that romantic comedies always have to labor through and then it flat-out turns into a generic romance plot. Why was it necessary to include the big misunderstanding, the chase, the earth shattering revelations and the dramatic resolution, all because no one can just sit down, talk and explain themselves to the other people? This is a movie that contains one of my all-time pet peeves because just like in every bad horror movie where the dumb teenagers get themselves killed because either they've never seen a horror movie in their entire lives, or horror movies just don't exist in this film, the people of ""Hitch"" suddenly all lose their brains and make the same dumb mistakes we've seen over and over. For its good parts ""Hitch"" is worth seeing but unfortunately it fumbles the ball right before the end and falls just short of being a truly great, original romantic comedy.

Surprisingly Good,"What - a Will Smith movie with nothing blowing up? I was all prepared to hate this movie. I mean c'mon, a chick flick with Will Smith? It seems Will Smith can only play one character - himself - but in this one he tones that down and comes across as a real human being.I was so surprised by this movie. I ended up laughing through the whole thing and came to care for and relate to all the characters.There was NOTHING about racial stereotypes. It wasn't about a black guy teaching a white guy to dance at all. It was about a bunch of characters who legitimately grow from the first scene to the last.Take you girlfriend and go!",,Anonymous,Romance
Often Very Funny and Worth Watching,"Will Smith is Alex ""Hitch"" Hitchens, a long-time bachelor who has become known as the New York City ""date doctor"" who charges to help men get the women of their dreams. Although he helps all these other men, he somehow is not able to have nearly as much success with Sara (Eva Mendes), the woman he himself loves.Hitch is a safe yet funny and entertaining romantic comedy. The premise sounds pretty good and the execution is also pretty good. Yes, it is very predictable and kind of cheesy. However, that doesn't mean it isn't entertaining. I think Hitch is better than most romantic comedies that have come out in the past year because the characters are likable and Smith & Mendes have enough chemistry together to make the film work. Will Smith is very charming as Hitch. He plays the role well and he never gets annoying. It's also nice to see him in a film that doesn't involve a bunch of things blowing up. Eva Mendes also gives a pretty good performance and she is also very pretty.Surprisingly, the best thing about Hitch is Kevin James. His performance is funny and also pretty realistic. The only problem is that most of his scenes appear in the trailer and this lessens the effect. I never really liked him before but now I hope he makes more movie appearances. Out of the four main actors, Amber Valletta is the weakest. She gives an average performance and she just doesn't fit well with the other three. The rest of the supporting actors are also pretty funny, especially the customers that ask Hitch for help.The only problem I really have with Hitch is that it plays it too safe. If it was a little more edgier than the film could have been really good but it still stands an enjoyable romantic comedy. It's not really surprising that the film is safe since Andy Tennant is the director. He directed It Takes Two and Sweet Home Alabama. He's like the king of harmless, fluff films and Hitch is his best work to date. Another thing that bothered me was the running time. 118 minutes is too long for a predictable story and it does take a toll on the audience. I think it's bad since the story is by-the-numbers and the film takes awhile to reach obvious places. If it was a little shorter, than it would have been fine. In the end, Hitch is an enjoyable romantic comedy and one of the funniest films I have seen this year. Rating 8/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Not ""laugh out loud comedy"", but it's enjoyable. Will Smith, Eva Mendes and Keven James are great in this movie.","Hitch, to some people might be the funniest movie of the season. Some might think it isn't. There were scenes that were kind of hilarious. Kevin James did a great job playing a secondary role. Eva Mendes is gorgeous. Will Smith is always funny in his movies, not matter what. Even if it is action. Will Smith needs to do more movies like this, romantic comedies. I thought he did a good job in ""Hitch"".In romantic comedy, Alex ""Hitch"" Hitchens (Smith) is New York City ""date doctor"" who has helped men to try and get the women of their dreams. While coaching Albert (James), a meek accountant who likes a celebrity (Valletta), Hitch finally meets his match in the person of the gorgeous, whip-smart Sara (Mendes), a gossip columnist who is on to him.Hitch is probably the best romantic comedy of the year. But if your expecting to be laughing you a$$ off, don't expect that. But overall, I enjoyed it. 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Why Not Call It ""The Date Doctor?""","Hitch is an OK title for this flick and lets your mind play around with the word, i.e., ""without a hitch."" Still why not call it ""The Date Doctor."" It makes a lot more sense. Plus ""Hitch"" is the title of at least two other movies made in the past five years. Parts of the film are hilarious. Will Smith and Kevin James work well together. I especially liked their dance routines just before the closing credits appeared. But, alas, the movie also has several boring spots, particularly when Hitch and Sara (Eva Mendes)are attempting to connect without spending the night together. Why modern producers and directors think that all films have to be around two hours long or longer so theater goers won't feel cheated is beyond me. ""Hitch"" cries out for an hour and half time slot. With just a little more effort by those behind the camera this could have been a romantic comedy classic. As is, it's just a fairly clever, funny in spots, well-acted melodrama.Words of wisdom are spoken from time to time by Hitch and others about the true meaning of modern relationships. Putting the pig Vance in his place was one of the high points of the movie. Of special note is the knee to the groin area he receives from Sara and then the long shot by the camera that immediately follows. Talk about divine retribution.Though one reviewer for IMDb found the allergy scene unfunny, the reactions by Hitch such as the weird cough that's almost a burp brought laughs from the group watching the DVD with me. The follow up at the store where Hitch and Sara desperately seek medication that will relieve his suffering also brought a howl from the popcorn crowd.Whereas many movies today end too abruptly before all the loose ends are tied, ""Hitch"" has a protracted ending or endings, for in truth there are three or four stitched together to try to satisfy everyone. Though wanting in several departments, ""Hitch"" is still worth seeing. Will Smith is at the top of his form. And the viewer should have a few good chuckles along the way.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Rewatched this movie after 10 years, it aged pretty good","Romantic comedies are not really my cup of tea, and I simply avoid them. However sometimes, when your girlfriend wants to watch these kind of movies, you need to find something that you can eventually like. So, while I was exploring the Comedies Netflix catalogue, suddenly appears ""Hitch"", movie that I have already watched 10 years ago. Usually I do not expect much from a Rom-Com, but in this case, they managed to tell a nice story, that teach an important lesson about love.Case was nice: Will Smith as usual is very charismatic and he did a good job in portraying this kind of playboy 2.0. He has many good moments during the movie and you can easily bound with his character because he lived many common and relatable situations during the movie. The acting is on point and he is amazing for the whole movie. I want also to praise the job of Kevin James that really made me laugh for the whole movie. Finally Eva Mendes, that in this movie is surprisingly good in her acting. A real shame that she left the acting career in 2014 and she never came back.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Will Smith can do no wrong,"I expected a good movie. What I got was an even better movie. The chemistry between James and Smith is just incredible. Glad to see him in a major motion picture for once!The movie works, because the actors play their parts perfectly. Will Smith is fantastic with his never ending charm; Kevin James is hilarious, and Eva Mendes...well, let's just say she plays that bitch/sweet/annoying role to the best of her ability.What I loved about the movie was the fact that Will Smith didn't even have to try to be lovable. He just was!! The ""date doctor"" had all the right moves, said everything in the most perfect of ways, and never ever went over the top.The funny parts are hilarious...and the cute, romantic parts are unforgettable.I totally recommend this movie. And no, it is not a chick flick.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fresh prince of Manhattan,"Not having seen the film in its commercial debut, we just caught with it via DVD. Expecting the worst, ""Hitch"" proved to be a pleasant experience because of the three principals in it. Thanks to Andy Tenant's direction, the film has an easy pace, and while predictable, the comedy has some winning moments.Hitch is a sort of ""date coordinator"" for losers like Albert, who is not exactly what one would consider a hunk. Yet, Albert is a genuine guy who, without some professional help would go unnoticed by the same women he would like to take out. Enter Hitch, to prepare him to overcome the obstacles that he can't overcome, and even though Albert stays overweight and never gets to master social graces, he conquers us because he is a real, in sharp contrast with all the phonies making the rounds in Manhattan.The basic mistake most production designers make, when preparing locales for Hollywood films, is how out of touch with reality they are. The apartments in which they situate these characters are so rare to find that only by the magic of the movies can these people live in places likes these. Evidently most of the movie people are dealing with fantasy since most city dwellers would kill for spaces so fabulous as the ones they show in the movies, let alone these same people depicted in the film would not be able to afford them.Will Smith is a charismatic actor. He has a disarming way to charm without doing much. The surprise of the movie though, is Kevin James, who as the overweight Albert, not only win us over, but he proves he can hold his own in his scenes with Mr. Smith. Eva Mendez is fine as the main interest of Hitch. In minor roles we see Adam Arkin, Amber Valletta, Michael Rappaport, and Phillip Bosco, among others.""Hitch"" is a fun film to watch thanks to the inspired direction by Andy Tenant.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Unberable Phonyness Of Cuteness,"Will Smith is fabulous. Elegant, handsome, funny, with an irresistible childish maturity. I hope one day he'll get the comedy his talent really deserves. ""Hitch"" is smooth, I hand you that, but the formulaic code by which the implausible proceedings unfold, makes the whole damn thing very irritating. I didn't believe in the melt down of Eva Mendes for a minute. The happy ending made me think and predict a ""Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?"" in their near future. There is an element of hardness and of selfishness that the cuteness couldn't mask. I couldn't help longing for Billy Wilder and I.A.L Diamond, for a moment of truth, no matter how ugly. Real comedies have that from Lubitch farces to Rock Hudson/Doris Day pastiches. None of that is present here. A few moments with Kevin James and the unquestionable charm of Will Smith will see you through, but that, unfortunately, is hardly enough.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Made me laugh out loud,"I just really enjoyed this movie. I don't laugh out loud easily & this one did it. Kevin James was a riot. The humor wasn't silly and most of the characters were as real as people ever get in romcoms. The movie relied on relationship rather than sex, which is a huge plus for me.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's Will Smith,"I don't think that there is much to say except that it is Will Smith. You can never go wrong with Will Smith throw in a little Michael Rapaport(Beautiful Girls), and Kevin James(King of Queens) you know you are in for laughs. I especially liked the movie because being a big Will Smith fan, I liked the fact he ventured out into a different role, from the past few films (nothing against the last few films just thought this one was a good twist). Also if any of you are looking forward to more good Will Smith movies, December 2006 he releases another movie that is also a little bit of a change and that is the ""Pusuit of Happiness"", guaranteed to be an instant hit. Not only does it show a different side of Will but it also stars his son Jaden Smith. There are still plenty more films coming from Will so be prepared for greatness, and also I am waiting for the Bad Boys III.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pleasantly surprised...,"I saw this movie screened last night, and you know what? I liked it. For the most part, it's a by the numbers 'chick flick', but makes no pretensions to be more than that, and in fact, is very good for what it is.The easy thing to do would be to take potshots at this film; throw out things like 'Fresh Prince', 'getting jiggy with it', and even throw around the whole 'black dude making a white dude cool' angle; but that's too easy isn't it? Like shooting fish in a barrel.No, this isn't a Wes Anderson film. The humor is rather broad, though much it very funny. Of course you won't see it up for an Oscar (what a tired joke that is); nor does it contain Quientin Tarantion-esquire dialogue or groundbreaking visuals.But taken for what it is, a romantic comedy, it really is very good. Great chemistry between all the leads. Eve Mendes is gorgeous. And Kevin James steals nearly every scene he's in. It gets a bit sappy towards the end (don't all mainstream romantic comedies though?), but if you're looking for a above average date movie with more than a few belly laughs, this is your film.A solid B+.",,Anonymous,Romance
Will Smith is actually good in rom-com,"Hitch (Will Smith) is the Date Doctor. He fixes up guys to get out their inner beauty for the girls of their dreams. Albert (Kevin James) is a hopeless slob pining for the beautiful socialite Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta). He's her junior tax consultant, and she doesn't even know he's alive. Sara (Eva Mendes) is a mud raking columnist. For some reason, Hitch can't get it together when it comes to her. Then she discovers what he actually does and puts it in the papers.Will Smith is actually loveably charming. The character could have come across as a douche. Kevin James is at his maximum adorableness. Will Smith and Eva Mendes get into too much slapstick. The secondary rom-com with Kevin James is very touching. It's a rom-com with just enough originality and charm.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
'Hitch' follows the formula to love,"Will Smith has been an action hero (""Independence Day""), a cool cop (""Bad Boys"") and a boxing legend (""Ali""). Now it's time for Smith to play something he's been primed for ever since he was the Fresh Prince  a romantic comedy lead.In ""Hitch,"" Smith plays Alex Hitchens, a ""date doctor"" that can transform a guy from an awkward, sweet geek to a suave, sophisticated gentleman. Alex teaches guys what they need to know to get the attention of a girl and how to succeed on three dates. Supposedly after that, they have the girl.However, Alex's world is stirred up when he falls for Sara Melas (the lovely Eva Mendes), a gossip columnist at a New York Post-like newspaper. Following the unwritten rules of a romantic comedy, Sara is cynical toward love and if a guy wants to get close to her, he has to be extraordinarily original.Alex does everything he can to follow his own rules and play it smooth. Yet, through bad luck and timing, he can't be the dream man he teaches others to be. In one scene, he takes Sara jet skiing, only to have his motor die in the middle of the Hudson River.A parallel plot to Alex's attempts to acquire Sara's love tells the story of Albert (Kevin James), who desperately wants to date a particular beautiful, rich heiress. Please keep in mind that this is a story set in movie-land, where almost everyone has good intentions and a chubby, clumsy nerd can woo and win over the nearly unobtainable woman.Alex gives Albert tips on everything, from where to touch a woman for the first time (the middle back) to how to dance. Just watching Smith deliver his lines about ""making all the right moves"" is entertaining. His observations about a women's' perceptions of a man are devilishly clever and I wouldn't be surprised if some guys took notes.Director Andy Tennant doesn't do anything strikingly interesting, but lets his actors mold the film. He also captures an excellent city vibe while shooting on location in New York. It might be the upper-class part of the city, but this is a movie and homeless people are not part of this reality.What makes ""Hitch"" a little bit better than your average romantic comedy is not its plot. Watching ""Hitch"" is like eating your favorite meal at a fast food restaurant  you've eaten it several times before but it still tastes good going down.Surprisingly, the performances of Smith and James are what make the film work. Although the preview of the film ruined some of the best bits, I laughed out loud several times at their antics and unforced comedic bravado.This movie was released just before Valentine's Day and if you didn't see it with your special someone then, be sure to take him or her to see it before it leaves the theatre. ""Hitch"" is a predictable, breezy film that makes for a sweet, enjoyable date.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Rom-Com where the Rom is all a matter of Comm'...,"It was my 37th birthday party, I was leaving the restaurant, my friend saw the girl I used to be in love with from the third grade, I left the place Roadrunner style.
My friend approached her, so I went back, we talked for what was the most magical half-hour since my divorce, and I left the place on a cloud of happiness I never thought I would experience again. I would love to contact her again, but how to? She's been so inaccessible that I feel like I've reached the limit and trying more would spoil that triumphant taste. So I guess what ""Hitch"" got right was that dizziness you feel where you're in love and the devouring desperation that ensues.The film gets more cinematic when the seduction involves the kind of tricks and planning that would have made Paul Newman's Gondorff jealous. Alex Hitchens' methods involve a lot of scheming, programming and digging private data about the target, so that the slogan might be ""do the stalking before the talking"" but in all good spirit as the whole process is wrapped up in the sheer conviction that any man can get any woman once he puts his mind into it, with the only concession to romanticism is that the man must truly love the woman. In other words, Alex Tennant's ""Hitch"" is a splendid example of the kind of movies Hollywood could never make again.The film doesn't insult women but it kind of belittles their involvement in the romantic process, or underlines a certain passiveness status-wise: the man has got to be in love (that's Hitch' creed as he doesn't let a prick get a woman for sex) and the man's got to do the job, to masquerade as someone as smooth as a cat and as cool as ice when in fact, he's at the verge of having a seizure, it's a harrowing journey but it's all worth it. And the girl's job is to notice the man and gets interested enough to accept a date, then she's got to validate the good feelings, and then she's got to be conquered.So, on the surface, ""Hitch"" belongs to the second school of romances when one of the two protagonists must conquer the other and let's admit it, it generally happens to be the guy. The other school involves more mutual attractions such as ""When Harry Met Sally..."" when only one of the two is a small step behind the other, but it's a collaborative job, interestingly we're talking of a movie written by a woman. Guess what? ""Hitch"" is not, but the fact that it is male-centric doesn't invalidate one theory or two it's got about the laws of attraction.Let assume for the sake of argument that it's not a man's job to get the girl, that ever since the dawn of history, the desire of possession has never been a matter of gender, then Hitch only points out that some guys don't have the right packaging to fulfill their goals. They represent the silent majority, they're overweight, bespectacled, sometimes both, they're short, nerdish, dorks, bald, and dream of women who play in total different leagues. That's the angle taken by Hitch, their consultant, a man who knows all the do's and don't of the art of seduction, a street-smart upper-class version of Cupid or the Charming Prince of Bel-Air.And Will Smith is not only the perfect choice for such a role but what he accomplishes is interesting, obviously his competence as a matchmaker can't do without a fair deal of manipulation, but it's never played out at the expenses of women's image. It's more of an end justifying the means, with the means never interfering with the likability Hitch' clients. On that level, Kevin James is always adorable as Alber, the dorky accountant who catches the eye of the beautiful Allegra (Amber Valleta) after one hell of a rant against his boss, and against her own passiveness too when it comes to business.And no matter how Allegra is genuinely in love with Albert, there's no way it could happen if Hitch hadn't paved the road to that realization. But that would be too easy, and the plot threatens his perfect streak with a big challenge, his own. Sara Melas, played by the sensual and smart Eva Mendes, is the tough nut to crack, a gossip columnist who doesn't fall for any man but seems interested in Hitch. Many of their dates turn sour, forcing him to revise his theories, but while he makes loser get the girl by succeeding, it's through the little incidents (some comical and some played from drama) that he touches Sara's heart.Still, we've seen enough rom-com to know it's a matter of time before the schemes must backfire so we get to the rule that every school of romance must respect: there's no true love without the truth. That might be love's dirtiest trick, covering your weaknesses long enough to finally unveil them once the heart is conquered. The irony is that's how the film works as well, it starts as a witty little crossover between ""The Sting"" and ""The Graduate"" but then ventures in the 'idiot' plot when Sara believes Hitch coached the playboy prick. She could at least give him the benefit of the doubt and hear his version before doing such a big thing as spreading it on her columns?The last part was a bit far-fetched but for its overall sensibility, its tendency to make men appear as lovable fools and women as not-so easily fooled individuals, after all, communication can't do without a little pinch of manipulation. But anyway, for a man's film, ""Hitch"" finds a fair balance between the old and new school of romance, it can appeal to any group, any sex and it carris a sweet, tender and almost nostalgic resonance in our ""battle of the sexes"" driven era.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
For a Rom-com this is good! Not too Chick Flick!,"Another romantic comedy. Oh lordy! This is perhaps my least favourite genre with so many trite and formulaic films that all have the identical plot. While Hitch is no exception to the boy meets girl, gets girl, loses girl and regains girl, routine, it is fresh enough to be an entertaining and breezy enough way to pass some time. Also the fact it doesn't star either Sandra Bullock, J-Lo, Kate Hudson, Reece Witherspoon being chased by some middle/upper class white guy is good. It is also good that it doesn't disturbingly star the barely legal Lindsey Lohan, Olsen's, or the barely out of nappies Hilary Duff being chased by a guy clearly nearing his 30's. This star Will Smith, who falls for Eva Mendes and it is this combination that gives the film a refreshing energy. Also starring is the King of Queens himself Kevin James who adds good comedic support as the bumbling white guy to make Smith look even cooler.The film follows all the usual romantic comedy formula but thankfully has enough chemistry and funny moments to keep it watchable and it doesn't seem made purely to market a record or give the women something to watch amongst all the guy action movies. Like for example One Fine Day which I found reasonably entertaining and with a certain charm (mainly because Michelle Pfeiffer is stunningly gorgeous), this works thanks to it's two leads and some engaging side characters. Being a big Willy film and having James in a supporting role it is also a little more comedic than usual. Certainly there are some funny moments.Basically as a guys guy, these films often make me want to gag and I find myself itching to watch something else. Hitch works in the sense that it is enjoyable and likable. Another rom-com this year starring the future Mr Demi Moore, A Lot Like Love, is a film I know would get on my nerves. Overall though Hitch as a good way to pass a few hours. ***",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A great date movie,"Last evening I had the remarkable pleasure of seeing the movie Hitch. I was stunned and amazed. Will Smith did a phenomenal job in a role that he isn't always associated with. He proved once and for all that he does not need to be holding a gun to be a great actor in a movie. Kevin James was also very impressive. I admit that I've always like him on ""The King of Queens"" but this role really brought him into the light more, and i hope to see him on the big screen a lot more in the near future. The movie was funny and adorable and I recommend it to any guy as the best date movie you could ever imagine. The mix of comedy, romance, and drama left me feeling complete. It's nothing like most ""chick flicks"" in the sense of tears and sadness, but holds its own and i think can be equally enjoyed by males as well as females. I encourage all couples especially to see this movie but even if you aren't involved with someone you may pick up some great ideas from Hitch.TWO WAY BIG THUMBS UP!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Momentarily Delightful,"This film was very much so characterized by moments -- moments in which it was quite funny, and other moments where it was very touching in its' message concerning love and relationships. However, other than these isolated moments and scenes, it was not worth watching.I felt as if Will Smith and Kevin James did terrific acting jobs, and played very well off of each other. They were a great comic duo and never did I feel that the comedy was either forced or unnatural, and in this regard, the film was impressive. However, other than many of these scenes, the film left me with much to be desired.Though Will Smith carries the film very well, the dialog was trying on my nerves -- sometimes to the point of being distracting from the movie. A lot of the dialog was so corny I could not believe that somebody could say these things aloud and keep a straight face! Furthermore, the story is a bit unbelievable and over-the-top.However, the main spirit of the film and the moments that Will Smith and Kevin James share were very well done, and overall, it was decent enough of a film to watch. I would recommend this as a good film for anyone who wants to share a romantic evening with a light mood, or to anybody who enjoys fast-paced comedy. However, this is by no means one of the better films I have seen, and I wouldn't recommend anybody to go out of their way to see it.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Kevin James stole the show!,"Will Smith's first full court press into 'Rom-Com' was a disappointment with a few exceptions (mainly in the slap-stick, physical comedy scenes). Will's love interest, Eva Mendes is a Latina beauty to behold but she & Will had little to no on screen chemistry. Eva could take a tip or two from Salma Hayek: remember to act while being while being gorgeous. The script is text book pap with a lot of clichés on male insight into the female psyche (I had no idea women find men paying attention to what they say a Turn-On...who knew?). Kevin James is a force of nature however & out shined the rest of the cast. This guy is too large for the small screen & I don't even watch 'King of Queens'. I thought actress Amber Valletta & James were a far more believable match even though both their parts were largely underwritten.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"clever, but there's a ""hitch""....","After a razor-sharp, if a bit unbelievable, opening sequence, this settles into a slightly humorous tale of a dating specialist. If you have the patience to wait five minutes between laughs, then you may be all for it. But there was something just a little too breezy about the whole thing, that I just didn't fall in love with it.At first you think Smith is pulling a ""Ferris Bueller"" by addressing the camera. But this is suddenly dropped and only referred to again in the final shot. But Smith is given some insightful material on dating, men and women, and the tricks used to acquire such. Some on-target, like a guy offering to buy a tired female jogger an ice-cream. Or implausible, with the opening nonsense involving a dog in a bag(??) and a faked accident.They then set up the James/Smith partnership, which I was surprised was not the core of the film. Because it's Will Smith, I guess the makers felt necessary to give him a romantic sub-plot as well. The James bits, though a bit ham-handed and too reliant on slapstick, had a certain charm because he and Smith click on screen. But the woman James is chasing---a dead ringer for Cameron Diaz---doesn't evoke that ""dreamgirl"" quality that an audience would root for.Later it's time to delve into the Mendes/Smith courtship, which is more sluggish. Mendes, an oddly faced actress (sometimes she's cute, sometimes she looks like a guy), is one of those spit-fires who seems like it'll take a crowbar and some dynamite to get into her heart (punctuated by an incredibly forced ""meet cute"" in a bar, laden with annoying third-person chat).Which leads to another problem with Smith's elaborate dates. Yeah, it would be nice if we all had thousands of dollars to go jet-skiing around the East River, or have a private tour of Ellis Island.

He knows her, but she finds out it's him, and he didn't know she talked to that guy...ugh. Or the fact that Smith is outed as ""The Date Doctor"" and it turns into tabloid fodder all over Manhattan.

Romantic Comedy Fit For Both Men And Women.  Highly Recommended!,"Hitch is about a man who knows what works with women and teaches the guys who do not do well with them some tricks of the trade. Actually, he more or less walks them through it. Hitch guarantees success up until the dreaded 3rd date kiss. After that, they are on their own. Of course, Hitch finds a girl who he falls for and everything that he thinks he knows does not work out for himself, when following the same guidelines. The movie was a well-written romantic comedy which both guys and girls could have a fun time watching. Perfect for Valentine's Day, which I'm sure was no marketing coincidence it was released on Valentine's Day weekend.Will Smith is perfect as Hitch. His performance here reminded me of a more mature, possibly grown up Fresh Prince Of Bel Air. He was the smooth talker and was able to read any situation for himself or his clients to make a memorable impression, then have a memorable date with the women his clients are affectionate towards. Sounds a little sleazy, but Hitch has his own rules. He does not help out the guys who want to ""Hit it and quit it"", so to speak, only those who really seem to like or love the woman they are after. One thing the film never gets into is what Hitch makes for a job like this, as I wonder how much something like that could be worth in monetary value.Eva Mendes plays Sara, Hitch's love interest. She does quite a good job in her role here. Sara is the type of girl who is always on the defense when approached by men, therefore, is leery of any advances. Hitch reads her well and makes his way in, until she discovers what is is he actually does. For some reason, women tend to take offense to his ""job"".Kevin James is also perfect as Albert, a man who is in love with a rich woman named Allegra Cole, but she does not know he exists. His expressions of nervousness and fright are hilarious. Heck, the movie is just a darn good one. Nothing too offensive, a bad word here or there but nothing major. I do not think it warrants it's PG-13 rating, but a plain old PG would be fine for me. Regardless of it's rating, I can honestly recommend Hitch to just about anyone and Will Smith rarely disappoints. 9.5/10",,Anonymous,Romance
"Will Smith in a romantic comedy? It's surprisingly good. No, really!","Hitch is something of a departure from what we're usually used to seeing in a Will Smith acting in. No aliens, no government conspiracies, but that's okay! Smith comes across as charming and good natured in his role as the 'Date Doctor', as does Kevin James, in an inspired comic turn from the actor (in many ways, he actually manages to steal the show).Having said that, Hitch does sag in places, notably the too-drawn-out repartee between Smith and Eva Mendes. However, the comic moments DO make up for this. It's a chick flick in the sense that it follows that basic formula with which we've become so familiar, but it's got comedy too, and it's even got the odd tense moment. Hitch is well worth seeing if you're in the mood for something light, fun, and ultimately optimistic and hopeful, this might well be your film.Well done Will, this is one of the few rom-coms that didn't make me cringe (too much).",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Definitely above average, as romantic comedies go","Will Smith stars quite admirably as Cupid in this romantic comedy about ""the basic principles"" of love (claiming, at the end, that there are none, is just the movie being modest; it really is about showing the broad lines of those principles). It is well-written, keeps your attention and does contain several really good bits. There is also the usual sentimental fluff to keep the hopeless romantics in the audience happy, but this movie is also for guys. The previous comment claims that the movie paints a flawless image of women - this is completely wrong. The very climax of the movie is to criticize women for the way they condemn men for using tricks and tactics in the romantic process, when women are themselves far more guilty of the same thing. Men are usually being looked down upon for planning how to snag a girl because the assumption is that he's only doing it for sex. Will Smith's character in this movie is the other side of the coin, demonstrating a much needed truth to women who think that men are just pigs: some men actually want relationships and not just non-committal sex. And, the movie is also showing that most of the problem about getting a relationship off the ground is the way women needlessly mistrust men - and how this mistrust can get way out of hand and undermine true love. Especially when coupled with the despicable tabloid press, which, while often looking harmless, is the very definition of shallow. I mean, Smith and Mendez' characters really are quite shallow and superficial. The couple we care about is the awkward and overweight accountant and the not-unattainable-after-all heiress, who are the ones not only getting something extraordinary, but fulfilling their most hopeless yearnings, showing that nothing is impossible.All in all a better movie than I was expecting, with both substance and optimistic messages. I should probably rate it an 8 rather than a 7, but... I'm no big fan of romantic movies, and this one *could* have been a lot more poignant than it was. Although, considering today's standards in film writing, I have to say it was pretty good.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
formulaic but held together with some good performances,First off there is nothing new about Hitch. It contains all the clichés of rom-coms and adds nothing new. What it does have is a likable lead performance from Will Smith which carries the movie.Without the right leading man Hitch could have been terrible but Smith is perfect. He makes Hitch cool and likable and is a very good comedy actor. Eva Mendes does her job well as the cynical object of Hitch's affections who is eventually won over but the best supporting role comes from Hitch's hapless client Albert. Albert is almost so pathetic that you want him to get the girl he shouldn't be able to. He also gets the films funniest moment.The New York setting works well and is used to add to the film rather than just be a setting. Overall Hitch is enjoyable formulaic fun which is helped by some good performances. Recommended.,7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Love Cynics hate Hitch but True Romantics believe,"It's about time the multiplex features a romantic comedy with a multi-cultural cast. As a New Jersean, I can honestly say Hitch did for New York what Pretty Woman did for Rodeo Drive. The city is appealing, the premise is intriguing and the acting quite wonderful. Only lovelorn prudes that have no hope of a great sex life could hate this movie.Now I'm not saying the movie is perfect as a matter of fact the last act seemed a bit little rushed. Alex's epiphany about love and his feelings for Sara seems incomplete. Is it me or did the director leave some film pieces on the editing room floor? But even with that said, it's a romantic movie that will have men alert enough to have an intelligent conversation afterward. Don't believe what the sour critics say about this movie  besides are any of them single in the current dating world? I believe most of them are either married or so hopelessly ridged in their solitary life that they wouldn't recognize dating for middle classed professionals people if it was on a screen in front of them.Will Smith enters a wonderful genre as Alex ""Hitch"" Hitchens, a professional dating consultant, and he is properly showcased with great cast mates - Eva Mendes (Sara), Kevin James (Albert), and Amber Valletta (Allegra). If Smith continues to stretch his talents in this arena I'm sure we'll see a great Tom Hanks, Sleepless in Seattle performance in the future.Hitch is a movie that makes single people and new couples alike believe in finding love in this cynical world. It's worth the price of admission.",,Anonymous,Romance

very funny,"This movie really was a laugh-a-minute. Will Smith can deliver any line and have it come out funny.Hitch was a movie with a rather predictable plot/story line. You already know how the journey is going to end up, but still, there is nothing like actually watching the movie unfold and seeing all the situations the characters get themselves into. Eva Mendez's character (Sara) gets a little annoying at times in the movie due to a possible irrational quality she may have had embedded in her. The explanation for this is given before the action that reflects this, and I fear this technique may be lost on some of the movies less perceptive viewers.There were not many special effects to comment on, there were some makeup effects on Smith's character (you may have seen them in the trailer) that looked convincing enough (as well as grotesque). Seeing Will Smith willing to look like that for a movie does make me respect him even more as an actor.Good funny movie, just a little bit of bad language. No sex or violence.My grade: B-",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Welcome to Bland World,"Nothing about this movie stands out as either being great or terrible.In the end, that is what kills it. The blandness is just not good. I can't say I expected better from Will Smith, but I definitely did from Kevin James of ""The King of Queens""-- but, hey, I'm getting used to saying that a lot lately. This film attempts to make its mark as a witty romantic comedy, but it never hits the bull's-eye. In fact, it never hits *anywhere* within the target. The allergy scene is disturbing; the fact that Kevin James can't dance is something that wouldn't exactly catch anybody off-guard, and is therefore (in a movie like this) not funny. This movie constantly tries to win your heart, but always with the wrong ploy at the wrong time. Some parts are okay (but I'm searching my brain for examples), but I really think this movie should be avoided.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
A date movie that's lots of fun,"Will Smith is ""Hitch,"" a love doctor of sorts who counsels men on how to get the woman of their dreams. He's very successful but stays out of relationships himself. Then he meets the beautiful Sara (Eva Mendes), a gossip columnist, and starts to fall in love himself.This is a very well done movie. Smith is utterly charming and likable as a sincere man who creates opportunities for men who otherwise might not meet anyone, let alone a dream girl. One such man is Albert, madly in love with a Paris Hilton type, Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta), who has all of her investments at the accounting firm where he works. After a lot of coaching from Hitch, Albert gets his chance with Allegra. One of the funniest scenes in the film is Hitch showing Albert how to dance - except Albert seems himself as an expert. Another great scene is Hitch teaching Albert the ins and outs of the kiss at the door.Not only did I think Hitch had some great advice, I think it is a fine film with some very good performances, particularly by Smith and a toned-down Kevin James. They are very well directed here. Eva Mendes does a terrific job as a reporter who becomes Hitch's love interest, who herself is trying to track down this love doctor after what she perceives as wrong advice hurt her good friend. A very funny script. Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Cute date movie for Valentine's Day,"In this romantic comedy, Alex 'Hitch' Hitchins (Will Smith) is a  legendary but anonymous date doctor in New York City.

Once Hitch accepts you as a  client, he will coach you on your first three dates; after that, you're  on your own. Hitch's newest client is Albert Brennaman (Kevin James), a  fat tax accountant in love with a celebrity client, Allegra Cole (Amber  Valetta). Allegra doesn't know that Albert exists, so Albert contacts  Hitch to make his dream come true. Hitch decides to make Albert a  client, even though, he knows this is going to be tough. While working  on this job, Hitch meets Sara Melas (Eva Mendes), a gossip reporter for  a daily tabloid, who is following Allegra's every move. Sara has given  up on men, and Hitch wants to cut through that layer, because he is the  master of love, so he thinks. With Valentine's Day around the corner,  this is a good date movie. Women will love it, and men may pick up a  few pointers. The movie is hilarious and filled with verbal and  slapstick comedy from beginning to end.

OK film,"Will Smith and Eva Mendes were very good in this film, but the way it was hyped up made it sound better than it actually is, it's a good romantic film, thats very similar to a lot of others and very predictable, but its not that much of a comedy. It had some funny moments in it but most of the moments that were suppose to be funny weren't done really well and most had been shown already in advertisements on TV.

Catnip for Girls,"Have you ever had a cat? If so, maybe one day you decided to give it a treat. A little catnip perhaps? Well, I did that for our cat. Just a little catnip, mind you. Then I put the bag on a high shelf and forgot about it.Forgot about it until the next day, that is, when I saw that the cat had somehow gotten up to the catnip, tore the bag apart, and spread it all over the surrounding area. I cleaned it up, but the cat still goes there, looking for the catnip. Evidently, he really liked it.Well, the best way I can describe this classic chick flick is that it is catnip for the ladies. I stole a few peeks at some females during our showing, and their faces suggested they were in the throes of rapture. I thought the film was OK, but it clearly was far more than just OK for the women who were viewing it with me.So, in short, Will Smith does his usual competent job of playing the Fresh Prince, this time acting as a date doctor. Eva Mendes is kind of bland, I suppose she does OK without taking much attention away from Will, which probably was the plan all along. Kevin James shines and provides the real foil to Smith's bumbling good guy routine. In smaller roles, Adam Arkin makes an impression. But really, this film is all Will, Will Will. If you like him, you will like this film.Another chick flick that delivers. Recommended as a date movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A good romantic comedy, Kevin James steals every scene!","I never really wanted to see ""Hitch"" to be honest. It looked rather lame to me but since the past few weeks, Hollywood hasn't released anything good, I figured what the heck. Also decent reviews for the film helped.""Hitch"" stars Will Smith as the date doctor named Hitch. Hitch knows everything there is to know about women so he helps people who can't get a date or mess up on dates, to do the opposite get the date and make it the perfect date. One day, Hitch gets a call from Albert (Kevin James) and this is Hitch's biggest project to date. But while helping Albert, the date doctor himself falls in love with a tabloid journalist named Sara (Eva Mendes) and from that point on Hitch can't do anything without messing up on his dates with Sara. Some funny moments ensue I have to say Kevin James's character Albert was the best character in the film. He was funny and very likable. I could relate to his character and enjoyed watching him do his thing as Albert. I think his role was perfectly cast. Will Smith was in the film a little too much if you ask me. I wanted more of Albert and the other people he helped. It was a little too much Will Smith but I have to say he was pretty believable in the film. I also have to add however he didn't do much for the comedy aspect except for the one scene which everyone already seen in the trailer and if you haven't seen the trailer I won't ruin the one really funny scene he has. Eva Mendes was also very good as Hitch's love interest. I actually liked her character more then Will Smith's. Its funny how that works in this film, the main character is the one I liked the least.First time screenwriter Kevin Bisch wrote ""Hitch"", all I can really say is that this guy must have liked ""How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days."" This movie reminded me of that movie at times. I did have the problem with the script as I said because like I said the film had too much about the Hitch character. From the trailer it seemed more about Albert but that wasn't the case for a good 30 minutes or so we don't even see Albert. I mean Will Smith seemed to want the whole film to him. I mean in the end it turned out more about Hitch then anyone else. I guess I was kind of disappointed by that. Also why are Fat People funny because they dance? I mean seriously it was amusing to me to see how flexible someone like Kevin James was but I know in the film it was more as a stupid fat guy joke. I mean not all fat people have to be morons but I did like that the tables did turn later on in the film and Kevin James seemed smart rather then stupid which the script first lead the viewer to believe. The dialogue was clever and smart of the characters. There wasn't much of a difference between Hitch though and many other romantic comedies, it followed a pretty usual formula. In the end, the script was above average.The film's director Andy Tennant in my opinion has never made a good movie before this film. This guy directed ""Sweet Home Alabama"" I wanted to puke when watching that movie. It was one of the worst romantic comedies I have ever seen. This guy also directed the forgettable ""Fools Rush In"", ""Anna and the King"", and the Olsen twins film ""It Takes Two."" So I guess now I can say this film was great compared to the other films he directed. He at least got the chemistry of the characters on film; the New York location was good but as always ideal for romantic movies New York or some other big city. He did a decent job on this one; lets just keep on this track because I never want to see ""Sweet Home Alabama 2."" So in the end, ""Hitch"" is probably the best film in theaters right now if you already seen all the Oscar contenders. All the films released in 2005 so far that I have seen have been pretty bad. I would recommend this film for a few good laughs and to have a good time at the theater. Like I said earlier the film would have been better in my opinion, if Kevin James was in the film longer. I really dug his character and his role was amusing and sweet. There isn't much originality in ""Hitch"" however that doesn't mean it doesn't serve its purpose of entertainment fluff. I would recommend it.MovieManMenzel's Rating for ""Hitch"" is a 7/10.

Disgrace Of A Movie!!!!!,"What is wrong with American movies these days? Hollyweird keeps making movies that have men acting like women and women acting like men. The idiotic male director and writer of this movie need to have their heads examined. The main problem with this film is its extremely feminist portrayal of genders which is fused with almost macabre conceptions of both sexes, and this disastrous combination is meant to be jocular.In the scenes of the bar, Eva Mendez and her friend are swigging from the beer bottles like you may find sailors on an oil tanker doing so at a bar in Reykjavik. Mendez continually touches every girl she sees after that and dresses provocatively in every scene, yet curses like a guy. She also gets very emotional when she fights with Will Smith while 'defending' women from bad guys everywhere.The men are no better in this movie. What we see is a bunch of idiots trying to do anything they can to obtain a relation. They are concerned with obtaining lewd favours or unable to speak clearly when face to face with a woman. Normal men in real life do not behave this way.What we see in this movie is a product of culture gone awry. Everything is flip-flopped. Guys act like girls, girls act like guys. All this is done while keeping the extreme predilections of the sexes very much a part of the story. Men are shown as soft and stupid but only interested in licentiousness most of the time, while women are shown as macho and overbearing but only as a veneer for their emotional insecurities.Some of this movie's ideas would be at the most watchable if they weren't presented obnoxiously to the audience.

"Formulaic but funny, and Eva Mendes is smokin' hot!","Call me a romantic comedy loving sap if you want to, but I enjoyed Hitch. There, I said it. I enjoyed yet ANOTHER romantic comedy. I guess I'm just a sucker for hot babes and some good laughs. It's a powerful combination that helps me overlook a movie's shortcomings, of which Hitch has a few: it gets too sappy at the end, it's predictable, it's formulaic. You've pretty much seen it all before:* Unlikely couple meets. * Unlikely couple dances around a relationship. * Unlikely couple finally gets together. * Unlikely couple experiences a major misunderstanding that splits them up. * Unlikely couple finally realizes the misunderstanding and reconciles.Not once did I find myself teetering on the edge of my seat, wringing my hands in despair because I was fearful of a disastrous outcome. But who cares? What I did find myself doing was laughing out loud quite a bit, while also trying to conceal the drool that would escape on the right side of my mouth whenever Eva Mendes would appear on screen. Woo baby!There are several things that helped me brush aside the familiarity and just enjoy the movie. You've got Eva who is hot and has a great personality. And Amber Valletta is pretty cute herself. Then there's Will Smith who is both charming and funny. He exhibits good chemistry with both Mendes and Kevin James, who is pretty funny in his own right. Come on, fat guy dancing! That's always good for a few laughs. Some people might find the over-the-top dancing a bit silly, but I'm one of those guys who can always find humor in watching white people try to dance like black people but doing a horrible job of it.I laughed pretty consistently throughout the movie until they cued the sappy ""You are the wind beneath my wings""-esquire dialogue near the end. I sincerely suggest that you pop the top on the Maalox or Pepto Bismal, take a good couple of swigs as Will Smith begins his extremely gay speech about love, falling, flying, taking leaps, blah blah blah, and your stomach should settle enough to let you enjoy a little more silly dancing at the end. Eva Mendes. Tight dress. Dancing. Thumbs up.Sure, things got a little too gay at times, but I appreciated the handful of moments where the movie poked fun at what initially looks like a sappy scene. I loved the bit with Eva watching Jerry Maguire and crying during the ""You complete me"" scene, which is one of the most gag-inducing lines of all time. Yeah, and you just completed my digestion cycle, Tom, because my food's coming back up. That's one line that simply can't be made fun of enough.My recommendation is that you grab your sweetie, accept that you're not gonna see any new ground being broken, make sure you have your yellow bucket handy for Will's big speech at the end, and enjoy a funny, cutesy, fairly safe romantic comedy for Valentine's.THE GISTHitch has enough laughs for the guys (and well, enough Eva for the guys) and enough romance for the ladies, for me to recommend it to those of you looking for a cute romantic comedy to help you celebrate Valentine's. There are a few moments that will gag you with sugary sweetness, but strong performances by Will Smith, Eva Mendes, and Kevin James help you overlook it.Rating: 3.5 (out of 5)",,Anonymous,Romance

It is curious how perfect is the style of Hitch, because everything in him, is thought and prepared, but results ideal. Sometimes can seem too much arrogant, but he is Will Smith! OF course he is arrogant!! Maybe it is not a great movie, but is better than the usual.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great Movie  not to take seriously!,"I know it's a little late to review this movie but I can't stand haters giving one star to it.It's smart, doesn't bore you, you will laugh out loud many times.The cast is great. Music fits just fine.Now a tip. Don't take the movie too seriously or judge it until it's over.I read a review about a gesture Eva makes in the movie which the reviewer found offensive. It's a comedy. It's not supposed to be realistic.I won't tell you what the movie is all about. Watch a trailer or read the plot.For its kind it's just the thing.

Cruelty to good guys.,"Hitch is a good movie. Will Smith carries the movie from reel to reel and you cannot picture anyone else to fill this role. Hitch was born solely by Will Smith. I think that explains the producer credit. And I also think that, on a personal level, Eva Mendes was chosen to play a character similar to that of Jada Pinkett-Smith. Throughout the movie, Alex trips himself all over Sara, and she responds, mildly, with amusement, but mostly with cruelty and during the rest of the show, you wonder why Hitch is doing this to himself.Hitch is the go-to guy, the 'date doctor' if you will, for nice guys wanting to get together with the women they fancy. But Hitch has his work cut out for him in Albert Brenaman, a junior tax assistant, who fancies his employer, a supermodel.Thank goodness for Kevin James. His character Albert, is the perfect choice (personally chosen by Smith, again) as a character who needs plenty of Hitch's help. He carries the film along with Smith. In the end, Hitch, is a good romance/comedy and I recommend it to any couple who can't find that perfect rental they can't settle on.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I don't think I've ever been so irritated by a movie before,"I don't know why I didn't turn it off. I didn't have to pay for it. I kept waiting for it to get better. Good. Interesting. Funny. Something. Another case of where all the good parts were in the trailer. I like Will Smith. I want to like his movies. This one was uneven and tried too hard.Parts of it were funny. Other parts were stupid. Other parts were sappy, but without depth. The acting was fine, the cast was fine. The production values were fine. I love NYC, it can't ever go wrong for a setting (in fact, it always makes me want to move back home). But even NYC couldn't make up for the bad script.Blech. I'm irritated and it's not even over. Please end soon. Please. It's like a car crash, I can't stop watching.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Ideal for evenings between girls,"Hitch is a movie that I've already watched many times, alternately with my family and my friends (Ideal for evenings between girls), simply a cult movie. Every time I'm watching it, it's a real pleasure; I can't stop smiling stupidly at the jokes and gags of the characters that are very endearing. Not to mention the remarkable performance from Will Smith, who knows how to play the cute and handsome guy who turns out to be also a sensible person. Regarding Kevin James, he has never been as funny. The quotes from the film don't cease to be amusing. In short, we forget everything during an hour and a half, we get back to reality with a huge smile on our face, a positive attitude, and the will to find (or to go find) the prince charming.In addition, for the fans of good music, the soundtrack is excellent; we go from Earth, Wind and Fire to John Legend, a real pleasure for the ears.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Lost all respect for Eva Mendes and the director,I used to love Eva Mendes until she kicked the guy in the balls for some mildly off-color comment (not about her).Imagine if I man kicked a woman in the ovaries for making some comment he didn't like.Incredible double standard and Eva never should have agreed to do that scene. Flabbergasted that she would agree to it. I guess she's actually not that pretty on the inside.Now you could say that she was just doing the job she was paid to do; but at that point in her career she could definitely question how that scene went. But apparently she sees nothing wrong with kneeing a man in his reproductive organs for saying something she didn't agree with.,1.0,Anonymous,Romance
I loved it!,"I'm a bit of a Will Smith fan, and a fan of all comedies, so I'm a little biased. There was a round of applause at the end of the preview, and a fair amount of laughter all though it. I didn't see the trailer, so I can't comment on it, but the movie was very well done.Will Smith did a great job, and there was a good mix of characters in the movie. The direction was excellent, with very few weird moments. This could be a great date movie - good for loosening up the situation. Guys and girls laughed during the movie.I'm a 46-year-old married male and I love explosions...but if you need explosions in your movies, don't go to this movie. On the other hand, if you live to laugh  give it a try",,Anonymous,Romance
Good-naturedly funny,"While the ""date doctor"" concept is the one thing that saves this film from being an otherwise average romantic comedy with a standard plot for the genre, I found it enjoyable enough to elevate my opinion of it so I ended up liking it a lot more than if it'd had just a mediocre plot without many twists. Will Smith does a great job, as always, acting as Hitch, the man who devotes his life to advising men how and how not to win over women...ever since his failed attempt to keep his college girlfriend. There're plenty of laughs as he tries to help his latest patient, overweight, gawky asthmatic Albert Brennman (Kevin James) successfully court beautiful co-worker Allegra Cole (Amber Valetta). Also, when he decides to rid a woman he meets in a bar of the turkey who just doesn't seem to get she doesn't want him around, he finds himself attracted to Sara (Eva Mendes) - it appears to be a big deal for him, so I guess since college he never actually practiced his own rules on himself. Unfortunately, Sara is a gossip columnist who is interested in ""the date doctor"" who got a seemingly dorky guy like Albert together with Allegra - especially AFTER player/jerk Vance Munson (Jeffrey Donovan) breaks her best friend's (Julie Ann Emery) heart and hints the date doctor he saw disgusted him, when she doesn't realize that he refused to see him. Still, trouble follows and Hitch is stuck left wondering about what to do with his own relationship, while not being any great help to Albert when he tries to figure out what more to do in his. The acting is good, there's a great deal of humor and some other fine points with meaning. Hitch's character is witty and wise, sometimes managing to be both at once. True, the misunderstanding where the woman is affronted at something the man hasn't truly done (why do they always show that?) as common and irritating - guess it wouldn't have been if it was the 1st, not 5th, time I've seen IT - but the rest of them were completely new. I only wish this movie was longer - I remember being able to watch 3/5 of it while it was playing on a restaurant's TV once - but I still approve. It's definitely worth the money to pay for its brevity.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Kick Your Date In The Head And Get Her Anyway,"That is the promise of the trailer I saw and by which I rented Hitch. Exactly, a serious film viewer shall not expect much further from this title but, surprisingly enough, Smith, Mendes, James and Valletta managed to reach a theatrical performance which could be metaphorically summarised on their rap dance-floor routine by the end of the film: their characters formed an effective combo which may prompt more than a good laugh with this Sunday afternoon DVD, providing your date is not an exquisite, french-swedish-directors-of-the-60's movie fan.P.S.: The techniques to score are all TRUE, especially the ""cocktail girl"" routine!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I haven't laughed so hard in ages,"I was expecting this Will Smith movie about a guy who runs a business helping other guys get dates to be mindless and idiotic. Which, it was. But it was also surprisingly very, very funny.Will Smith, who has that ""nice guy"" kind of appeal, is believable and down-to-earth as Alex ""Hitch"" Hitchens, a guy who has all the answers when it comes to other people's romantic problems, but none of them when it comes to his own attraction to his perfect match, Sara (Eva Mendes). In the meantime, he plays cupid for a klutzy, socially awkward accountant and a beautiful heiress. The storyline has that ""yeah, right"" factor - but then, nothing about this movie is supposed to be realistic.I entered the theatre skeptical. But scene after scene induced side-splitting laughter, and gradually I had to admit to myself that this is pretty good comedy. No, the movie doesn't contain any social statements or earth-shattering revelations about humanity. But it made me laugh harder than I had in ages, and for that alone it's worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A very good comedy and one of Will Smith's better movies,"Will Smith has always been a special case in the world of the famous rappers and R&B artists. He seems to be the only one who is still able to make songs in which every woman isn't called a whore, in which you won't hear any swearing every two seconds... But next to being a good musical artist, he's also a good actor. Many have tried it before, but only few have managed to switch from singing to acting and back. Will Smith has and although his movies aren't exactly masterpieces, they are almost always fun to watch.In this movie he is the 'Love Doctor', a man who has made a living out of helping other men to get the girl of their dreams. He has always been very successful and all his clients are happy, but when he meets Sara, a gossip columnist, his own advice doesn't bring him any closer...Of course this movie is based on the same scheme every romantic comedy has been based on: boy meets girl - boy and girl fall in love - they have a big fight and start hating each other - they overcome their problems and live happily ever after. It has been done many times before and I'm sure that it will be done many more times after this one. But I've got to be honest and tell you that I really enjoyed the movie. I enjoyed it because of the humor, but also because of the good acting of the different actors. Next to Will Smith I especially enjoyed Kevin James' performance. I only know him from the sitcom ""The King of Queens"", but he proves to be very capable of doing movie work as well.All in all this is a very decent comedy that will give you a good time. My advice to everybody who wants to hear it: take your date with you when watching it, you'll both like it. I give it a 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Magical...with caveats!,"It is spellbinding. The three leads are so comfortable with one another. Kevin Jamess comedy is very versatile and his physical skill gives the film added depth. I had wanted to see a good romcom for so long, and here it WAS. I am actually laughing at the utterly competent and sublimely confident Smith in every scene and he delivered the slick script with the deftness and verve of a skilled master-boy of comedy. The sub-plots were there to glue up all the seams and they did so very well. Eva Mendes was delicious.Did I say spellbinding though? Oh my! I forgot the last 40 minutes of this movie where I allocate 9/10 to the first part and 4/10 to the last 40 minutes. Why? Because, for the end of the movie the storytellers in their complete boneheadedness decided to strap the characters rigidly to a ""Loses-girl-Situation falls apart-Saves situation-Gets girl back-Live happily ever after"" formula that kills ALL of the humour and for the most part, the characters stone-dead. Simply because it was wrenched from its natural flow.Awful...and the same thing happened in 'How to lose a guy in 10 Days"" too. Pattern emerging and I think it might be 'Studio Management interference'.Anyhow, I have decided to up the combined average score from 6 to 7 because Eva Mendes is gorgeous and Kevin James proved that we should see more of him.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Awful all-round,"This film is severely disappointing and was badly made. I was expecting it to be funny, which it isn't. I was expecting it to give good advice about how to get hot girls - which it doesn't.Will Smith is even more narcissistic in this than he is in most of his films. Kevin James' character is annoying and pathetic, rather than funny. I've never understood Eva Mendes' popularity - she's neither hot nor a good actress.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
So so funny,"I laughed and laughed and laughed! Will Smith is so versatile. He can do Ali, he can do alien butt-kicker, he can do family guy on the run from Big Brother, and he can do Mr. Funny as hell date doctor. Yes, Will Smith has a certain quality that transcends all his movies and identifies his flicks as ""this is a Will Smith movie."" But so does DeNiro and so does Nicholson. Debate the greatness of the former compared to the latters all you want; that's not the point. The point is that Smith's charm is what makes people want to see him. His talent and versatility keeps us coming back (tho that golf movie? Not.).But it's not just Will Smith; it's Kevin James, too. Who knew how great this guy could be! Wasted on that fat-guy-with-cute-wife TV show that looks like all the other fat-guy-with-cute-wife TV shows. The trailers paint him as the stereotypical white boy can't dance guy. Well, ya know what? He's only that guy if his character believes he's that guy -- and he doesn't. He is GREAT in this movie. He positively steals every scene he's in.Eva Mendes also shines. The girl can kick butt and look adorable at the same time. And she wears those sky-high shoes very convincingly (note to men - no one is comfy in those shoes, but we love 'em, anyway).Don't drink too much pop during this movie; you're likely to pee in your pants from the hysterical laughter.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pretty Good - I wasn't a fan of some of the casting,"Kevin James and Will Smith really make this movie shine. The comedic timing and the chemistry between the two of them was almost perfect. I would have given this movie 8 stars if they casted anyone other than Eva Mendes for the romantic lead opposite Will Smith. My goodness the woman never smiles and always looked either disinterested or angry in any scene with Smith. Every time I watch it, I ask myself why is he chasing her with her attitude? Don't get me wrong, she is attractive and is a good actress in other roles. However, she didn't hit it out of the park with this performance. The trivia says Jennifer Lopez was considered for the role which probably would have been a better choice as she can be more bubbly.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hitch came unHitched in the final act.,"I watched all of this movie up to the last 10 minutes when anyone with 4 brain cells could guess what was going to happen next. The movie itself was entertaining and mostly original until the last 15 mins when evidently the screenwriters couldn't figure out where to go, so they just closed their eyes and picked from the ""every predictable Hollywood romcom"" barrel for the final act.I'll get back to that in a minute. First let's talk about the good stuff. Will Smith is, as always, a great asset. He plays a character ""Hitch"" who's a modern day matchmaker but with a soul--that is, he isn't just hooking people up for the conquest but he actually believes in love. Unfortunately he just doesn't believe in it ever happening for himself, so he goes through life jumping from one (implied) random hookup to another whilst he reserves true love for his clients.I know, right? Great premise. And for the most part the film holds up its end of the bargain by developing an interesting tale woven around this theme. Will Hitch finally learn to love? Physician heal thyself?Like I said, I shut it off in the last 10 minutes so I wouldn't know. But when things devolved into some horribly predictable romcom trope with the obligatory stupid misunderstanding and all the other obligatory stupid stuff that comes with it, every promising aspect dissolved.I actually recommend this movie so that you can laugh at how overtly a writer tries to manipulate the audience with a recycled formula. Enjoy the film up to that point (like I said, the presentation itself is entertaining enough to warrant your time). But just be ready with the clicker to shut it off as soon as you've seen enough.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Moderately entertaining comedy--a bit unsatisfying,"This is a classic, very clean American rom-com, full of all the fairytale trappings of the genre, but also missing the anarchic undercurrent that makes for the best films in that tradition. It's a fairly amusing hour and a half, but not much else.Part of the problem stems from Will Smith's status as producer on this film. He seems completely unwilling to get his feet wet. Until the last ten minutes, you'll see none of the zany-sexy energy that made his work in Fresh Prince show compelling. Instead, you get the cloying, metro sexual, sleazy-charming Will Smith.This could have been funny if the film had given more opportunities for the Hitch character to trip in a pile of his own BS. But 90% of the film treats his womanizing posturings with complete sincerity, undermining the comic possibilities. The erotic tension, battles for sexual dominance, and love-hate fireworks that make for the best rom-com pairings are startlingly absent between Smith and Eva Mendes. It's as if Smith the producer tried too hard to reign in Smith the comedian, and undermined countless laughs because of it.Kevin James fares much better in the role of a schlubby accountant trying to win the heart of his heiress client. Surprisingly, his impeccable timing translates even better to the big screen than the small. It's telling that his Smith's chemistry with James is much stronger than with Mendes--he seems to be the only scene partner where Smith wants to let loose.For some reason, all the wackiness that was lacking for almost all of this film seems awkwardly crammed into the last ten minutes. The result is an embarrassingly executed finale. Smith's desperate attempt to win Mendes' heart, which is supposed to be Hitch's most heartfelt moment, feels utterly insincere after the romantic iceberg of the past 90 minutes.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

great comedy,"I really enjoyed this movie. Will Smith, easily lovable, was very funny as Hitch, a ""date doctor"". the other performances were very funny. This movie has great comic timing and a very funny storyline. I loved the fact that it had many new twists on old story lines. There was nothing funnier that seeing Will Smith fumbling his words as a dork in college. You've seen it in Fresh Prince, but this is a whole other level of dorkiness. If you don't like romantic comedies, just see it for that one part. The dance moves were hilarious and unforgettable, and there is a great romantic scene that involves an inhaler(no joke). Sure, this is no Oscar winner, but it's a great feel-good movie. This movie was funny and incredibly sweet. And no, it's not another ""How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days"" don't worry.

so-so romantic comedy,"In ""Hitch,"" Will Smith plays a modern-day Henry Higgins, who, for a tidy fee, will teach lessons of love to a bunch of lovelorn Eliza Doolittles - only, in this case, the Elizas are grown men who desperately need instruction on how to win the hearts and affections of the women of their dreams. Of course, the irony is that Hitch doesn't adhere to his own formula, being a confirmed bachelor with no interest in entering into a serious relationship with anyone himself. Until, that is, he meets the woman of his own dreams, Sara, a New York City gossip columnist who has no idea what it is Hitch does for a living.It occurs to me that, when it comes to certain movie genres - action movies and romantic comedies in particular - it would be helpful if we could inflict some kind of temporary amnesia on ourselves so that we could at least think we were watching something new and fresh and not something we've already seen a hundred times before. Even the best romantic comedies can't entirely avoid paying homage to ""the formula,"" and ""Hitch"" is clearly no exception. As such, the film has some mildly amusing moments, some endearingly sweet scenes, and some cute little plot complications amidst all the sentimental clichés, lowbrow slapstick and tired stereotypes we generally find in these films. (I mean, do we really need yet another romantic comedy in which one of the heroine's co-worker sidekicks is a light-in-the-loafers, preposterously effeminate gay man?). It seems like every time ""Hitch"" is about to win us over, it short circuits itself and loses us by going for the obvious.Smith makes for a smooth romantic lead, but Eva Mendes doesn't always seem up to the challenge of her role, particularly when she is called upon to convey dramatic intensity. Actually, of the performers, it is Kevin James (""King of Queens""), as an overweight klutz who has hired Hitch's services to help him woo a beautiful blond heiress, who walks off with the film. Even though he's only a supporting player, it doesn't take him long to assume center stage in the film, essentially relegating the leads to second banana status.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Everything is being ghetto-fied and being dumbed down and it's true, they definitely will not make good movies like they used to.

Hitch Had Me In Stitches!,"Alex Hitchens (Will Smith) plays what he calls himself, a ""date doctor"", who helps people who are less fortunate with the ladies. After some rather awkward moments as a young man, he learned some things and now passes them on to other men for a living. He must be good at what he does, too, because he has quite the nice bachelor's pad. ""Hitch"", as Alex Hitchens is nicknamed, has a gift for knowing how to romanticize with the women, but eventually stumbles upon Sara (Eva Mendes), who even he has a hard time keeping it cool in front of.In the meantime, Hitch is helping out a fellow named Albert (Kevin James), who is about as unlucky with women as they come. Albert was so bad, that even Hitch almost turned down a chance at helping him, but later takes on the challenge. Kevin James did a great job as the female challenged, awkward male in love. The chemistry between James and Smith was better than the chemistry between Smith and Mendes, which is surprising.Of course, it would not be a story if Hitch's world did not come crashing down around him at some point in the movie, so it does and you can almost guess what happens.

It made me stop and think how I have been prejudging these hardworking down to earth girls all this time, when in fact they're not superficial bulimic junkies but just down to earth people like you and me. Credit also has to go to the screenwriter, for having a character called hitch who helps people get hitched, its not since 'skeletor' in the he-man series that I've seen such a perfect fit.

Yet another fluffy rom-com with a disappointing ending,"For most of its running time, the new film from director Andy Tennant (Sweet Home Alabama) and first time writer Kevin Bisch is hilarious. Unfortunately Hollywood rom-com ennui strikes in the last 15 minutes to collapse the soufflé that is Hitch under the weight of its own sentimentality.New Yorker Alex 'Hitch' Hitchens (Will Smith) is so smooth, he does it for a living. Helping hapless guys date the girls of their dreams, that is. His latest project, his ""Sistine Chapel"" is chubby accountant and dance maniac Albert (Kevin James), who's head-over-heels for socialite Allegra (former supermodel Amber Valletta). But when Hitch meets cynical gossip columnist Sara (Eva Mendes), his panache leaves him. The usual flirtations, misunderstandings, girly chats and last-minute epiphanies ensue, made bearable by quality comedy (in particular, the trip to Ellis Island).Will Smith glides through his first rom-com role, although admittedly not much is asked of him. But what Hitch sees in the irritating snarky Sara is a mystery. Much more interesting are the supporting leads, whose mismatched couple manage to spark real chemistry. As far as fluffy date flicks go, Hitch doesn't miss a beat until the last 15 minutes, which only the most syrupy romantics will enjoy.

When he runs into the women of his dreams(Eva Mendes), however, he has plenty of trouble finding the words to say! I absolutely loved this film and I would recommend it to millions!

Better than the new romantic comedies,"It's a nice movie to watch more than one time to pass time and entertain yourself. All performances in this movie are good and Kevin James is really funny as Albert specially the scene in which he calls Alegra and he asks Hitch if he should tell her that he is not in! And then Hitch goes like: you called to tell her that you are not in!!! That scene is hilariously funny. I liked Kevin James in here more than Mall Cop. Mall Cop, unfortunately, is not a funny movie at all! Besides the funny scenes in Hitch, the movie also has some deep messages like the fact that people only superficially admire the beauty, social status, and never the real under-skin thing! We all keep talking about it and criticize it while in real we are all victims of it and most probably it is the same reason why the majority of us have lost the opportunity of being with someone nice and decent but not good-looking, rich, or well educated! We need more movies like Hitch, Shallow Hal, Truth about cats and dogs and the likes to really start creating the balance in our emotional lives not judging by appearances.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Decent Date Movie,"In terms of storyline, 'Hitch' presents nothing new but there are a few laugh out loud moments and some funny ones. It may not rank among the most memorable romantic comedies but it certainly does not make for a bad watch but a decent one. Andy Tennant sticks to the story and keeps it light, in spite of a few over-the-top moments and he refrains from using racial stereotypes and avoids stressing on cultural racial differences. The two romantic pairs: Smith and Mendes and James and Valletta are well chosen and the lead actors share a good chemistry. Will Smith does well in the title role, even though he makes a complete fool of himself towards the end when he's begging Sara Milas to take him back. Mendes is quite adequate. Kevin James is hilarious and he and Smith form quite the fun buddy duo. Amber Valletta is a beauty and acts decent. The final dance sequences were hilarious along with Hitch's failing attempts to impress Sara and his unsuccessful attempts at fixing up Albert with Allegra. 'Hitch' is funny and romantic enough to make for a good date-movie.",,Anonymous,Romance
Unrealistic but cute.,"I thought it was a funny movie, even if Will Smith did too much monkeying around. That girl, Viagra, Allegra or whatever her name was, she would never marry an old fat man like that. Also, the actress looks a lot like Cameron Diaz. In fact, something tells me that Cameron might have been offered the role but turned it down because she was not offered enough money. As for the sound editing it was awful. They made the music too loud. My friend agreed with me there too. Also, I like movies that make sense. This movie was unrealistic. Not a bad movie to rent, but no way would I have forked over 11 dollars to see it in the movie theatre. My friend told me that he liked the movie because it shows how complicated women are that men have to get a consultant to know what to say to a women and when. Well, I happen to think that men happen to be great scam artists, because they all want 1 thing and that's how to get into someone's pants.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A self-indulgent rom-com rescued by Kevin James,"Hitch is a film about two love stories. One of these stories- between Will Smith and Eva Mendes- is tedious, off-putting and shamelessly unrealistic. Two self-satisfied obnoxious morons with awful careers and awful world views bathing in their own pretentiousness. Every second of interaction between these two vile characters is painful to watch and made worse by the fact that they're probably not even acting very much.The other love story- between Kevin James and Amber Valletta- is much more palatable. It is sweet and sincere and, while it may be a bit far-fetched to imagine these two ever actually getting together, it is a romance you can feel positive about and root for.As a comedy, Hitch has plenty of good moments- largely down to Kevin James' bumbling character and his associated mishaps. The story is reasonably interesting but, like most Hollywood films, it drags on way too long and indulges itself in many unnecessary scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A nice little romantic comedy,"I am one of those non believers of love. In today's society we are either too busy or can't get enough of that lovin'. But in ""Hitch"", I agreed with Will's character. We don't give love much of a chance.I think that's why most people enjoyed this movie, it gave us a little hope for true love. I have to admit, even I had a little faith after this film. The story is very cute and fun to watch. The chemistry within Eva and Will's character was interesting and believable. And I loved Albert's character, I thought he was so sweet. I would recommend this movie, for cold heart romantic's and the hopeless. It was sweet and fun to watch.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
No justice here,"The gossip columnist (Mendes) destroys lives without remorse. She finds love at the end, so my sense of justice was offended. Is this a serious, dark film like ""Arlington Road"" or a romantic comedy? It spoiled the happy ending, at least for me.Smith's role is that of an honorable guy. He only helps ""good guys"" find true love, sometimes with the women who would normally overlook them.Kevin James was well cast, and he handles his role quite well. I was very surprised at his grace and athletic prowess during his dance moves and during a street scene. Kudos for the big guy.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Superb,"Hitch is an unusual person with a very unusual profession. His job is to create opportunities for men to hook up with the girls of their dreams. As a pro, he teaches them step by step, through the smallest detail, for the whole plan to have the most chances to succeed. While helping his latest customer, Albert, a clumsy bloke in love with a celebrity for whom he works, Hitch encounters a lovely gossip journalist who might just be his very own soul mate. But because she's determined to play ""hard to get"", he will need to try something different in order to prove his true love, especially if she's to find his true identity.It's an extraordinary story, truly emotional and dramatic but also extremely hilarious. We follow his professional character as he flawlessly and almost without any effort helps his customers and the dramatic turn his life takes when he meets Sara. It's very well thought but also very well played. Will and Eva do a great job interpreting their roles, creating a great atmosphere for you to enjoy. Simply brilliant!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good Romantic Comedy,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film, and felt endeared to sympathise with the characters throughout. The opening scene in which Will Smith, talks eloquent, yet humorous dialogue on how to deal and remain positive in love is brilliant, I also particularly like the opening soundtracks of 'Wonderful World' by Sam Cooke and 'Love Train' by the O'Jays really capture the essence of a movie that intends to spark the imaginations and cheer an audience of anyone up. Smith really blossomed in this role of the love doctor and his words and phrases on how to allow love to blossom appear understandable and captivating to an audience. After all the movie as shown by the front cover reveals Will Smith, stood up in casual pose, wearing smart clothes that indicate comfort with his identity and appearing seemingly ready to answer any questions.As an audience we also warm to Albert, the bumbling middle-aged corporate man, who at first seems unable to handle himself let alone a potential relationship with a woman. This induces humour in an audience as we are encouraged to support the 'laughed at' character in his quest for love. Allegra Cole the subject of the affable nerd, fits this image of the desirable goddess perfectly.Eva Mendes is portrayed as the glamorous, hard to get, reporter who is overtly critical of men. Her pairing with Alex Hitchins however seems well-matched, as both undergo a challenge to relinquish their occupations and personalities to try to care for one another in a quest to banish their problems in place of real true love. The setting is also brilliant and perfect for this satisfying romantic comedy, in particularly Ellis Island for the date.One critical aspect however would come from the ending scene which is awful. Will Smith's character is too over-eager to get back with a character that is clearly not meant for him. Eva appears effectively done with their relationship and I think for an audience desiring reality, a break up in some form would have been more satisfying and real. The fact that Will goes as far as to jump on her car is nauseatingly far-fetched and from an audience perspective I'm left a little disappointed having enjoyed the film the whole way through. Albert and Allegra in contrast however are rightly together at the end.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Not great but enjoyable, mainly thanks to the charismatic performances from all","Alex Hitchens has a skill with women and he earns his very comfortable living by helping men through the first three dates with the women of their choice  no matter how unattainable they are. He doesn't do it so the men can ""win"" but instead to help the women see the man inside, passed all the dorky mannerisms and social failings they may have. He only works by recommendations and he keeps a low profile. With his latest client, Albert, he is trying to help fix him up with the famous Allegra Cole, while he himself is trying to win over reporter Sara  the former surprisingly going better than the latter. However Alex couldn't see how the two relationships would end up affecting his whole business.When a star really pushes the boat out to try and promote his movie, you do have to wonder how good the film actually is. So when Will Smith turned up on Broad Street in Birmingham as part of 4 UK premiers in one day I did think that perhaps nobody trusted the reviews to be able to sell this film on its own merits. However I finally relented and give it a try and found it to be quite an enjoyable little comedy  nothing special but having just enough wit and charm to fill the time. The plot is very thin and goes to the conclusion that you always knew it would but yet somehow it is still enjoyable. This may be down to the script which as plenty of small laughs along the way and gets good mileage out of introducing us to Hitch's world and working with Albert while also developing the stuff with Sara. It isn't rocket science but it does work.What really helps is that the cast are all into it and have enough charisma to choke a horse. Smith leads the affair with his usual swagger but is still confident enough to have his image punctured at times to the benefit of the film. He seems to mix really well with both his co-stars. Mendes looks sexy and sassy throughout and her energy helps to make more of her character. James may be just another fat man in a comedic role but he works with his basic tools well and is quite funny at turns. Valletta is quite enjoyable in a smaller role while faces like Arkin, Donovan and Rapaport fill out the cast list despite not having a great deal to do. Nobody is brilliant but the lead three do have enough charm to cover up for the fact that the material is just rather ho-hum for the majority.Overall then an enjoyable but unspectacular rom-com that does nothing new but at least has energy and charm. The cast do well to get mileage out of the concept while the writers have done enough to stop it sagging too often. Genre fans will enjoy it of course but its charm and broad humour will make it a nice, if forgettable, experience for the casual viewer.",,Anonymous,Romance
Hitch is a pleasant surprise,"Let me just start off by saying i do not enjoy romance's or drama's really. I find them to not be my forte', and usually do not hold my attention. i wanted to go see hitch because i find kevin james to be a hilarious person, and a talent that is very underused. On that note i am not a will smith fan, and although he has had a few good roles, overall he usually does not float with me. hitch was a solid movie in the aspect that while you may not be a romance fan,it can keep you watching based on the laughs. it has its slapstick moments, and its physical humor, but it also has humor that lies beneath the surface. yes a lot of parts are cheesy and fall into the romance genre, but that is to be expected from this movie. eva is gorgeous as will's love interest, but they do not seem to build an on screen chemistry. Kevin james, as will's protégé, and bumbling accountant albert had me laughing in nearly every seen he was in. he was great in his role, and really helped me to stay enthralled with this movie. I hope to see kevin james in more of his style of movies int he future. I do not believe this movie really fit kevin james but he did a great job in filling his role. This is a good date movie, or a movie to go see on valentines day. While the plot is somewhat shallow at times, there are a few sparkles that make this movie worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Take a date to this very enjoyable romantic comedy, and you could learn a thing or two. (My wife assures me that most of Hitch's advice is right on the money.) But has anyone else noticed that Hitch's high moral stand doesn't really match his behavior in the pool bar? But the script zooms past this inconsistency and you barely notice it, if at all.

If this film were a cheese it would be Feta - a good tangy cheese but nonetheless a cheese,"I've watched this film many times and enjoyed it. However, on my most recent watch I enjoyed it the least. As Rom-Coms go it's up there as a classic, however at points it's a cliché love-fest. The number of insincere inspirational quotes sounds like Smithy is reading from a Pinterest board (if Pinterest had been founded five years prior). On the other hand, I have had many entertaining hours watching and rewatching this film so thank you Andy Tennant.Question: Kevin James - actor or good at falling over?",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Probably the worst movie I have ever seen,"""Give her a puppy and she'll fall madly in love with you."" Thus, the overall theme of the film ""Hitch.""The basic premise and message of this movie was entirely false and superficial. The idea that if you dye your hair a certain color and like a certain TV show, that some girl will finally notice you and fall in love with you is a horrible message to instill in someone's head.Now, before everyone comments a million times, saying ""that's not true! Hitch even says that all his job is, is getting the guys to be noticed by the girls and then they take care of the rest!!"" Well that's fake, too!So what happens when you say you love the same movies as this girl that you've been dying to have ""notice"" you, and a relationship begins, and then she finds out that you lied. They teach us that relationship's are built on honesty, trust, and communication. How can you learn to trust someone, when the first words out of their mouths are lies?My point is that you don't need a fancy trick or some stupid similar interest to get a girl's attention. All you need is your OWN personality and some confidence. And, even if you are yourself, and the girl still rejects you and acts like you're stupid, then you should have half a brain to realize that she's not for you. You should be lucky to find a girl who likes you for you, and not the car you have or the movies you like.P.S. The movie also stole a line from ""The O.C."" and from ""How to lose a guy in 10 days""""what do you want from me?"" ""I just want you!"" From the O.C. episode ""The way we were"" original air-date: 11/11/04 Hitch's debut: 2/11/05""Are you trying to kill yourself?"" ""if that's what it takes, yes!""

"Supposed to be just another romantic comedy, but his story flows perfectly. Time passes and we will increasingly involved with the twists and turns of the plot","Known for her starring in the hit series Mad One Piece between the years 1990 and 1996 action movies (Bad Boys (1995), Independence Day (1996), MIB - Men in Black (1997), Enemy of the State (1998) , I, Robot (2004)), and dramas like (The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000), Ali (2001)), it is time to Will Smith venturing into a new genre: the romantic comedy.Alex ""Hitch"" Hitchens (Will Smith) is a legendary ""love doctor"" who lives in New York and in the past had a broken heart and swore that never again would suffer as he suffered. But he does not accept the job only if the man wants to take advantage, leaving once with women. It helps only those who want a serious relationship, involving true feelings. One of their ""clients"", is the fat, meek and bumbling Albert (Kevin James), an accountant who fell in love with socialite super famous and powerful Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta). Meanwhile, Hitch knows aa journalist Sara Melas (Eva Mendes). Passionate, Hitch decides to win her even at the risk of having their identities unveiled by the newspaper where Sara works.With Smith himself in the production, director Andy Tennant worked with an original screenplay by Kevin Bisch, and both relied on charisma and talent of Will Smith, and did well. It is a delightful romantic comedy. The film breaks new ground in showing the plot by the male viewpoint, showing that he decided to help other men after suffering a major disappointment in the past, and instead of conquering the female audience to see that it only helps those who have true feelings and not guided by ulterior motives that could lead to the woman suffering.Some factors contributing to the success of this plot. The first is light and accurate direction of Andy Tennant, who never force situations. Its direction coupled with the issue of dual Troy Takaki and Tracey Smith Wadmore-especially in the opening scene in which some men are shown aided by Hitch and his relationships being helped by councils. Ali was showing so very creative and interesting hints Hitch a simultaneous editing of three cases and functioned effectively as his work helping their clients to do better in the meetings. Transitions and cuts while Hitch narrated the background is well done and in a few minutes showed the character and the audience.The second key factor in the film work is Will Smith. Few actors have the charisma of the actor. Its partnership with the great Kevin James sitcom Raymond and Company and especially The King of Queens, is one of the best in recent years. Several scenes are in our minds. James provides the best comedy scenes, even with Will in the cast. The scenes in which Albert impulsively quits and then repents, the scene where he shows you how to dance Hitch, the scene where they kiss during one of the tips of the Doctor of Love, are worth the price of admission-rental. How Hitch makes an analogy at one point, as he and Albert as being Michelangelo Sistine Chapel (which Albert would the artwork Hitch) was well thought out, because apparently that would be the biggest challenge so far.The screenplay by Kevin Bisch, which makes everything very fluid and natural and is packed with good balconies, catchphrases that although corny, work (such as the sequence in which Hitch is hit in the final), and different dialogues and intelligent like the first time you see Sara in Hitch bar and ""save"" another person who tried to woo her despite her giving signs of not wanting anything to him.The single displaced in the film is Eva Mendes. If there was another actress, the impression we have is that the result would be the same. The duo's most successful romantic comedy Hitch and Albert, not Hitch and Sara. But not enough to commit in time, Eva Mendes and has not only transformed his character into something more than it could. Julie Ann Emery as Casey, and beautiful, does well. Is also charming and beautiful Amber Valletta as Allegra Cole, who made a great partnership with Kevin James in his scenes.The film was supposed to be just another romantic comedy, but his story flows perfectly. Time passes and we will increasingly involved with the twists and turns of the plot. Everything works and fits here - an attractive picture, an interesting script, charismatic characters and a direction that only helps to drive the plot - turning and giving a greater depth to the genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

A very worthwhile movie for what it is,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The PitsRelationships with members of the opposite sex can be a tricky and frustrating thing. So it's good to have someone like Hitch (Will Smith) around. He dedicates his life to reading and understanding the body language of women and determining how to make a good relationship work. But the nature of his occupation is secret, and it's only a matter of time before it becomes known. Plus, although Hitch is a hit at match-making with others, his own love-life is highly questionable.This is probably not the kind of film I'd usually give a go, but I remember when it premiered in my home city earlier in the year and Smith did a day long trek from Manchester to Birmingham and I went to the Birmingham premiere, purely for research purposes, I'm no Smith fanatic (unlike some of the girls there!), I just wanted to see what that kind of thing would be like in person. But this adverse publicity has finally rubbed off on me and I've given Hitch a go.As I said in my summary, for the kind of film it was it was very worthwhile and a refreshingly different sort of film for me. Smith has a natural presence and charm in the lead role and he is backed up by a very good supporting cast. It's an inspired concept, and the story, though a little incoherent, is funny and perfectly charming when it needs to be. It's basically all pulled off with aplomb and a very satisfying end product has been delivered.It's not a classic and it's not likely to leave a very long-lasting impression, but it's a nice film and a very pleasing way to spend a couple of hours. ***",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Amiable romantic comedy,"Amiable romantic comedy starring Will Smith in one his better roles as the 'Date Doctor' Alex ""Hitch"" Hitchens advising high flying business execs on how to date the girl of their dreams. A subplot follows Hitch battling against the odds to woo gossip columnist Sara (Eva Mendes) who is a career girl 'sworn off men'.I find my attention span for Will Smith's characters is usually pretty limited, but I managed to find him likable for the whole of this (slightly overlong) movie. Although the plot is fairly predictable, and the goons needing makeovers are pretty standard, the movie manages to be consistently amusing and a lot of the dating 'tips' are quite good common sense. Hitch is also a man with his heart in the right place - he wants to 'create opportunities' rather than teach men how to 'score'. He is almost the Dr Jekyll of the Dr Hyde character created by Tom Cruise's memorable performance in Magnolia as the dating guru who teaches men to get laid in the most cynical of fashion.There's also the odd gem under the mishmash of this fairly mindless entertainment such as ""Life is not measured by the breaths we take but by the moments that take our breath away"" ( - not an original line, but quite a beautiful one).

Predictable rom-com,"It was quite strange to watch a film such as Hitch - I usually avoid breezy rom-com's like the plague. It was only because myself and my girlfriend were tired after a train ride on holiday and the place where we were staying had a DVD player and a small selection of titles. Hitch seemed the best option (I wanted to watch Wilde but we both agreed something easier to watch would be for the best). My instincts usually tell me that film like this will be predictable, annoyingly frothy, and sentimental, although able to raise the occasional smirk. Well, my instincts were pretty much right. Hitch (Will Smith) is a date-doctor who takes on his biggest task yet - to teach how overweight corporate idiot Albert (Kevin James) to romance celebrity Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta), whom Albert has become smitten with. He is also dealing with his own love life - romancing hard-nosed columnist Sara (Eva Mendes). That's it in a nutshell really. Although thinking about it, the film isn't much more than that.There were moments of this film I enjoyed. Will Smith makes for a likable actor, breathing sympathy into his rather smug character, and Kevin James, best known as food-loving truck driver Doug in TV's King Of Queens, is amusing as the embarrassing and bumbling Albert. The film is stronger during the scenes when they are together, and only when Hitch begins to delve into his own romance where the film becomes frustrating and rather unconvincing. Eva Mendes' character is just annoying, and I failed to see the attraction that Hitch would have with her, apart from the obvious physical qualities. When the film looks like it's going to stretch it's legs outside of the comfortable rom-com cliché, it sits back in safety and just turns into a bore.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

Three Charming Leads Make Hitch A Winner,"Hitch is the perfect formulatic date movie that brings a charming cast and hilarious situations together into an enjoyable popcorn flick that will not disappoint.Will Smith plays Alex ""Hitch"" Hitchins, a date doctor who helps out hopeless men get the women of their dreams. He sets up situations that get the woman to first notice his client, then consults them on three dates before sending them on their way to a blissful and happy life with the woman they love. His business is by reference only, which is why he is able to keep what he does a secret from the public. This being Smith's first outing in the romantic comedy genre, he handles it like it is the only genre he has ever done. Smith is wonderful since he is playing his charming self, only as a date doctor out to prove to the world that any man can sweep any woman off her feet.His newest project is Albert, a seemingly hopeless case who is madly in love with Alegra Cole, lead owner of a prestigious company who doesn't even know he exists. Kevin James is suitable cast as Albert, playing the clumsy, asthmatic, all around good guy who only wants to love someone. He and Smith play off of each other with good comedic timing and a natural chemistry. The especially funny scenes come when Hitch is consulting Albert n how to act on his first date with Alegra, and hilarity ensues. It proves again the versatility of Smith, who before Hitch had primarily starred in action films.Eva Mendes is perfectly cast as Sara, a gossip columnist who, for some reason, falls for Hitch's charms even after a botched first date. Hitch has an over all comedic tone, but that's not to say that there are a few sentimental parts that could have either been handled differently or left out, such as a scene between Sara and Hitch that takes place in her apartment. The scene was a little too sappy, and broke the rhythm that had been set. It felt very much out of place, but once the scene ends, Hitch picks up momentum and becomes a lot of fun again.Take your date to this movie, and it is a guaranteed good time. Although Hitch is the formulatic boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl, with charming leads and a happy ending. There's no way you can go wrong! MJR",,Anonymous,Romance
Interesting,"I watched this with a bunch of friends during a lull in interesting things to do.Admittedly, the main draw for most of my friends was Will Smith. Not being a huge fan, I entered the cinema as a sceptic. Did I leave as a convert? Not quite, but Smith impressed me suitably enough for me to have enjoyed the film.As far as plot goes, it's predictable. But then, did I really need to tell you that? It has some fairly cringe worthy moments script wise, but somehow the charming cast make it click.The only casting objection that I had was the irritating Eva Mendes. Sorry to all her legions of fans, but the girl can't act, and has a voice that more than grates.If you're going to see this, sure, have fun. Just don't expect anything brilliant or more than mediocre.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Light-hearted & humerous film!,"A good cast with a nice story line that's somewhat unique than most other rom-coms! Nice humour, good script & a good selection of cast - Will Smith's charisma & confidence makes for a good role as a date-doctor. And Eva does a good job in playing a pessimistic, guarded character in approach to romance without being too stereotypical.Overall, a good choice of movie if you're looking for something light-hearted & funny! The only thing is that it probably shouldn't be a 2 hour long film. 1.5 hours would've cut it fine as after this time, the movie almost drags on until the end.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Will Smith is the Date Doctor,"A fairly typical Rom-Com with the usual cliches and story beats one would expect from this sub genre. However, what keeps this film engaging is the on screen chemistry between its 4 lead characters whether it's a romantic moment or a comedic one. Adding to that, the premise itself is really nice and the film as a whole manages to leave you with a good feeling which helps you overlook any tropes or cliches",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Funny and Charming,"""Hitch"" is a great date movie. Yes, it's formulaic and predictable, but Will Smith and Eva Mendes make attractive leads (Mendes is incredibly hot!), and the supporting characters add a wonderful comedic touch. Kevin James steals the show as the lovable and clueless schlemiel who desperately needs help to win the beautiful and famous Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta). James is a master of physical comedy, and portrays a compelling character whom the audience can't help but root for. Will Smith plays the ""love doctor"" with confidence and intelligence. Mendes is a cynical, hard-nosed gossip reporter who has all but given up on love. The scene in which the two main characters meet is well written, with witty dialog and an acute eye for the difficulties men encounter when attempting to attract the attention of a woman they've never met. Those seeking ""cinema"" with its art theater sensibilities will may not find ""Hitch"" particularly engaging, but if you're looking for an entertaining movie that's funny and charming, you won't be disappointed. My date and I enjoyed ""Hitch"" thoroughly and managed to reenact the goodnight kiss scene later that evening!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A very good movie!,"It's a very good movie in my opinion, because it present a new vision about the relationship between a man and a woman, about what chances can have a man who is not very ""cool"" for a high class woman, it's very interesting.In the start Hitch tell us some rules, but in the final after he met his made those rules are no more useful. ""Two can play that game"" can say that it has this king of subject.In both movies are difficult situations created by rules and ideas made by the time. I can say that kind of films are very good because after we see theme, we are absolutely sure ""never say never"" and the love is the most beautiful feeling a human can feel.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not Bad,Hitch has been making millions upon millions of dollars at the box office. And although the film falls into the majorly mediocre category it fares well as a watchable comic valentine. Wil Smith stars in fine comedic form as a the title character a date doctor of sorts who helps Good guys with no talking skills achieve the unattainable. Eva Mendez stars as a man hating gossip columnist whom becomes taken back by him after some laugh inducing situations until finally discovering his profession and questioning of she should expose him or not. The movie boasts some funny moments mostly not associated with the two leads and although the film lacks any type of originality overall or even a shred of believable chemistry it exhibits an energetic flare for keeping you watching. Although far from being a success it far from being a train wreck as well. Hitch lands a 6/10.,6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"great comedy, great cast....",I saw a sneak preview and had little hope for the movie being as good as the trailers since Will Smith has picked some real bombs lately but wow.. what a surprise and it was due to the whole cast being stellar. The movie had some depth to it since the subject matter is rather superficial but it redeems itself and adds some new stars like Kevin James who really steps up the beat to make the 3rd act come alive! And Will Smith is truly splendid in top of his game hitting every part except a few minor corny ones toward the end but this will surely be a film to brighten anyones day and make you laugh for a few hours straight.Big thumbs up and kudos to Sony for finally having a hit!!!,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"great first half, then falls apart","For the first hour, this is a very funny movie, fueled almost entirely by WIll Smith's inexhaustible supplies of charm. And Kevin James is quite amusing as a klutzy guy who seeks his help in winning the girl of his dreams. There are things that could have been better - there's no explanation of why Hitch targets Mendes and works it so hard or anything to indicate James' ""love"" is anything more than an infatuation with a girl because she's pretty, but the movie bounces along with minimal plot and much humor for a good while.The movie dies when the story kicks in as Smith's romance begins to clash with James. The moment I saw that open, I knew exactly the pedestrian path the movie would follow, and I found it painfully to watch it tritely and predictably play out. The complete lack of originality was downright insulting to the audience, as though the writers couldn't be bothered to even try for anything different from a million other mediocre romantic comedies.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hitching a ride to nowhere,"Will he or won't he? Of course he will: perfect fodder for the ever-smarmy Smith, who is played off against the goofy underdogs and losers in a dating game with experts. He's the implicit hung overdog that knows it all already. It's a cartoon film with live people: not a single character in the movie has a backstory. We're five years into the 9/11 aftermath and American myth-making has reached a pitch of hysteria. And again the Cinderella story, amid the ultra-rich Manhattan clans, but with the ""ethnic"" touch.

Cute romantic comedy starring the fresh prince of bell air,"Will Smith is charming and can lift any movie he stars in just by being himself. In Hitch he plays a matchmaker who himself never has luck in finding love. Couples will find this to be a pleasant way to spend an evening. Not only does it follow the expected trajectory of Cupid's arrow by piercing the heart, but it brushes against the funny bone as well.

It was entertaining and Will Smith did a good job in the movie but who really brought out a great and funny performance was Kevin James. His role was great and he had the most laughs. Eva Mendes was looking very fine and had also a good performance. The movie had good laughs and it was a perfect date movie to see. The script and direction was also not bad.

"""Hitch"" a ride away from this movie","** Will SMith, Eva Mendes, Kevin James, Amber Valleta, Julie Ann Emery, Robinne Lee, Nathan Lee Graham, Adam Arkin. Directed by Andy Tennant. A lame summer comedy of sorts that only leaves the dull minded laughing while I get stuck falling asleep in theaters. The movie attempts to make you laugh at the comedy when I am laughing at the idiots that surround me laughing at a joke that isn't even there. Will Smith attempts to play Hitch a date doctor willing to help uncoordinated men get the women of their dreams. His newest case is Albert (James) who's dreaming of dating Allegra Cole (Valletta).

Fantastic ...,"funny, entertaining and well worth watching - its difficult to express the feeling it leaves you with. Will Smith hit a high again. It had the feel good factor that so many films lack. Its a great film and not just for the girl's, plenty for the lads to laugh at, I would definitely recommend it. The whole cinema were in stitches at times, especially the dance scenes, it was so funny. Storeyline was entertaining too, and didn't go dead in places at all, it had the typical disaster scene you get in most films, but you always knew it would have a happy ending.Certainly a film I could watch over again and probably one I will buy when released.Music was excellent too - hopefully the soundtrack will be released ??",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just not funny,"Rating-3/10Hitch, a Romantic Comedy starring Will Smith as a kind of love doctor who basically helps those less ""experienced"" at love and relationships. The movie itself is for me overrated, I have seen what some say about it and I just can't agree. It's a real predictable movie, seen before and really not very funny, it's not without it's heart but still, a fail in my book.Now Smith gives it a good go, he isn't the problem at all here in fact he is one of the shining lights, excellently showing off his acting side in certain and I mean certain scenes. The story is too predictable, it's kind of new I'll give it that but it really doesn't play out any different to most poor Rom-com's. The love side is a little shaky really, I felt the chemistry between those who are involved is not great, can be good but could be a lot lot better.You know I said this is a comedy but in truth, if you laugh at this then I commend you. It just isn't clinical enough and Andy Tennant the director just doesn't get enough from the cast, who could actually make this very funny if directed well. If you like the fun over the love then don't watch this, the romance is better than the humour involved so this is one that does best for the lovers.Kevin James stars alongside Smith, and so does Eva Mendes who for me doesn't do herself any good, the role doesn't work and she just feels too unbelievable in her role. James does nicely in his role, should have been funnier but still manages to be fun to see and some of his scenes(mostly with Will Smith) are some of the better times. If you want a cast who work well together this isn't it, but individually this has moments of good fun to be had by all.Now this film is fairly under-whelming, a kind of predictable cheese ball that has an air of smug(I felt the people behind this think it is much smarter than it actually turns out to be). It's a little too long at near 2 hours, kind of stretches itself and that is another reason this doesn't finish all so well. The move has it's extreme moments of cliché, it has it's moments of fun too and although few laughs, when some like Smith try to be funny, you can still smile if only a little.Overall a movie I wouldn't recommend to many but could work for some, the kind of picture that wouldn't inspire me to see it all again but isn't the worst of the worst either. This is a bit of a blip for me in the career of Will Smith, in general it doesn't look like it with what I can see as the majority of critics and film viewers generally liking it but he doesn't finish this well, on that watch out for the ending scenes, the worst part of the entire movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very Impressed by the production!!,"Last night, my wife and I decided to catch a movie, and after looking at what's playing, we decided to go for Hitch. (Will Smith was on Oprah a few weeks earlier talking about it, and I thought that is potentially a pretty funny movie.Well, I can tell you, I wasn't disappointed, I can honestly say that I don't think I spent more than 1 minute during the movie without, at least a chuckle. that movie was just funny. Yeah I know it's a romantic comedy, and I loved it! Wives, if you want to take your hubbies to a romantic comedy, I'm pretty sure this is one they will enjoy.I think the moral of the movie is really cool too. It gives average looking guys a chance at honest dating. As I'm thinking back now, the movie somewhat reminded me of Shallow Hal. They seem to revolve about the same set of topics... Personally I liked hitch more than Shallow Hal, but they're definitely in the same arena.Eva Mendez was absolutely gorgeous in the movie... if nothing else, guys can go see it for her :) Over all, I think this was definitely worth watching. for those of you who like to watch only big productions on the big screen, hitch isn't one, and I think you can enjoy it just as much on your TV set at home when it comes out. That being said, I think it's a great ""date"" movie...",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hitch hilarious,"Over the past century, there have been many advances in gender equality, but not so much in the world of movies. I'm not talking about what goes on behind the camera, I'm referring to the tastes of the audience. The idea of a ""chick flick"" is alive and well today, while there are still plenty of action and horror films which appeal primarily to males. Sure, there are men and women who enjoy the movies that fall outside of their typical demographic, but there aren't many movies which have appeals across the board. Hitch, the latest Will Smith vehicle attempts to change that trend by being a chick flick which throws in a dose of male perspective.Smith stars in Hitch as the title character, Alex ""Hitch"" Hitchens, a ""date doctor"" who trains men on how to approach a woman and have a successful date. Hitch enjoys his job and loves to see men successfully accomplish their goals of going out with the woman of their dreams, but due to a bad experience in college, Hitch himself is somewhat sullied on the idea of love. As the story unfolds, the film introduces two seemingly separate story lines. Hitch's latest case is Albert Brennaman (Kevin James), an accountant who is very attracted to one of his clients, the beautiful heiress Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta). Hitch has his doubts about Albert's chances, but if his clients desires seem sincere, Hitch supports them.In the mean time, Hitch meets gossip columnist Sara Melas (Eva Mendes) and is instantly attracted to this strong woman. However, the date doctor can't seem to follow his own advice in pursuing Sara. Things get even more complicated when Sara's job leads her to investigate the relationship between the accountant and the heiress. Will Hitch be able to balance his private life and his job? And more importantly, can Hitch believe in love again? If you are a true movie fan, then there's been at least one time in your life when you've complained about the redundancy of the Hollywood movie factory and cried out for something new and original. Well, Hitch ain't that movie. But, most movie fans will also admit that occasionally a formulaic movie can work solely on an entertainment level. Hitch does qualify as that film.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Meh.,"''Meh'' basically sums up this whole film. The acting? Meh. The story? Meh. The plot? Meh. The characters? Meh.In all seriousness though, this is one of the most boring, mainstream ''been there, seen that'' kind of movies I've ever seen. The acting is questionable, Will Smith is a great guy and all, but come on he can do better than this! And don't even get me started on Eva Mendes...The characters themselves aren't much too hooray for either. They are kind of hard to wrap ones head around, and not in a good, complex way but in a ''they didn't really think this through, did they?'' kind of way. The characters all do surprising and out of character moves throughout the film, which is very confusing and distracting. If it wouldn't have been for the very straight forward and foreseeable plot this film would've been even more of a mess, so I guess a lack of twist is a good thing in this case...Are you desperate to kill one and a half hour?

"Unoriginal date movie, some funny moments but it's been done before","In every movie Will Smith is in he plays the same silly over the top character whose vibrant fast talking and silly personality always are the largest presence in most of his movies. Hitch exemplifies the personality unfortunately his presence is the only thing of any value in the movie, an unoriginal idea, and a script that is unfunny keeps him from really being himself. Will Smith plays a man who sets up men with the women of their dreams, for a sizable fee. He is very wealthy, very well-to-do and all around very appealing. He himself falls for a woman, and he is not nearly as confident and appealing as he makes his client out to be.Part of the reason I couldn't get into this movie was not just the unoriginal and uninspired acting, script and direction, but all of these characters are very wealthy, don't struggle for a living like most people, and generally speaking people tat are well off do not make for great entertainment. The movie just drags on and on, I was wondering if there would be any funny lines in the movie, there really wasn't, I was wondering if there was going to be anything in the movie to remember, there really wasn't. This is a movie that was just there, not really good, not really bad. Kevin James provides decent support, but that is about it. Writing about mediocre movies is hard there's nothing good or bad to talk about so you basically summarize the movie. This isn't a horrible movie but it isn't anything to jump for joy about either.",,Anonymous,Romance
"I'm not a huge fan of the date comedy, but this one works","This movie was much better than I expected. After a couple of films by Will Smith that weren't that great like I, Robot, he is back to being likable and fun in this one. Smith plays, Hitch, a date doctor. Most of the film centers around him teaching Albert how to be himself and get a date with Allegra Cole, a rich famous celebrity whom he works with. Albert is a klutz and goof and always tripping on his feet or what-not. All Hitch does is teach him how to act more cool and not be so nervous around Allegra.During all this, Hitch meets Sara, a gossip columnist whom has sworn off men. Hitch charms her, so of course, they go out. But, Hitch may teach other guys how to get the girl to fall for them, he doesn't believe in love himself. He has never really had a girl since he was dumped in college. But, he likes Sara, so keeps going after her. Sara's friend is hurt by guy whom she thinks went to the date doctor. So Sara tracks the doctor down, only to learn its Hitch. So of course, she thinks he's a pig.

A real surprise.,"On the advice of a trusted person, I decided to see Hitch for the first time.
I didn't know about this film and more people were surprised by it. So, without idugi, I looked at it in one breath. Hitch is presented as a classic romantic comedy, an enjoyable film, without too many pretensions. But it doesn't take long to reveal itself, a pleasant surprise. The plot is simple and the characters are nice, even if a little too characterized. The film flows beautifully, and despite its simplicity, it proves to be well articulated and well structured. The scenes are clear and understandable, the jokes funny and the whole thing is very addictive. It is a film where you can immerse yourself and identify with some characters. Too bad for the quality of the photograph, you could do much better.
Obviously I have to make an honorable mention to Will Smith, who leads this fun film as a protagonist.
So, without saying anything else, I recommend you relax, put yourself in bed or on the sofa, wrap yourself in the blankets with your boyfriend or girlfriend and enjoy a cheerful evening. And if you don't have a special person to watch it with, well, take advantage of it, watch it and maybe you could get some advice.
Hope this review is useful, goodbye.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Your girl will love this one, too......","Okay, so this may be the better romantic comedy so far this year. I loved this movie. It was funny and touching and there was some depth to each character that lead you to understand their idiosyncrasies. Will Smith was delightful, Kevin James appropriately nerdy, and Eva Mendes a great workaholic 21st century girl. The premise that men need a little help to get beyond the obvious barriers to asking ""that girl"" out is a good one. I think I finally understand ""what she sees in him."" The plot twists are gentle and not totally unpredictable, but it is endearing that when it comes to his own love life, the date doctor has a boat load of trouble. He can't seem to put any of his own advice into play effectively. The supporting actors are terrific and Will Smith has never been better. I am a great romantic, and even after all these years, still believe in forever love. I bet your girl does too. Take her to this one.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Dating Coach Facing His Biggest Challenge,"This film essentially begins with a man by the name of ""Alex 'Hitch' Hitchens"" (Will Smith) giving advice to several other men during the dating process. His methods work and he makes good money in the process. The film then shifts to one specific incident where an extremely shy accountant named ""Albert Brennaman"" (Kevin James) asks for his help winning over an extremely rich female celebrity by the name of ""Allegra Cole"" (Amber Valletta) who just happens to be a client for the firm where Albert works. Sure enough, using some tips from Hitch, Albert manages to get her attention and begins to work toward a relationship with her. At the same time, Hitch suddenly finds himself attracted to a pretty newspaper journalist named ""Sara Melas"" (Eva Mendes) who poses a significant challenge to his dating expertise because she is so resistant to his advances--and this becomes even more difficult when she hears of an unknown accountant named Albert Brennaman dating Allegra Cole. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say this was an entertaining film for the most part with the scenes between Hitch and Albert being particularly humorous. Conversely, although Will Smith performed quite well overall, I honestly didn't feel much chemistry between him and Eva Mendes due mainly to her cool demeanor overall. But then, maybe that's just me. In any case, all things considered, I enjoyed this film, and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Botched job. Some bright moments with the supporting cast, but 'Hitch' is not funny, not romantic, not believable, even as a fantasy","'Hitch' has some pieces of better movies in it. But those good pieces are hopelessly tangled and mangled in a mean-spirited failure. It seems that writer Kevin Bisch and director Andy Tennant have seen lots of good romantic comedies over the years. The polite thing would be to say that they envisioned an homage to the genre. A more blunt expression would be that they ripped off what they thought were the cute bits from other people's work. There are stretch marks all over this turkey. At the end of the day, they missed the point entirely. 'Hitch' is not at all funny, nor even pleasing, nor is it particularly romantic.Will Smith is a good actor--- likable, strong presence, wholesome demeanor. That was obvious here, although he might have phoned in part of this performance. In a very weird way, the most successful bit of sex and romance with Will Smith came in a comedy bit involving not a chick but the dude, Kevin James' character.The rest of this cast are largely unknown, Michael Rappaport's (Sp?) and Adam Arkin's cameos notwithstanding. The cast of yet-to-be stars appear to have reasonably strong chops, and some of them may well make it as successful and long-career actors. In fact, the surprising bits of the only grace and good vibes (the rare portions that approached romance) came from the two 'secondary' characters, Albert and Allegra, played by Kevin James and Amber Valletta. The sparks and romance between them were believable, and really nice to watch.Will Smith's character was actually believable enough most of the time, but the female lead he was saddled to was a first class ****. I don't know what part of this character, named Sara, seemed funny or endearing to the writer or director. In real life, such a demonic witch would have gotten a prison sentence for aggravated assault, and would be avoided as a poison by all who had even heard of her. Whatever, in this movie's universe she was not in prison, and not shunned---- but what could Smith's character have possibly seen in her? She wasn't beautiful, merely sort of pretty, in a trashy kind of way. She wasn't nice, wasn't funny, wasn't witty, wasn't sexy. Oh well, that is a head-scratcher. She and the odious Vance character were actually the better match for each other.So, lofty aspirations, fellas, but stick to the old adage, and only write what you know. So go out and have some real romance and some real love, laughs, life, etc., before you attempt to make another movie. I gave this a 4 out of 10.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

Great romantic comedy,"Can you say ""Romantic Comedy""? If you look it up in the dictionary, surely this movie would be mentioned, and I can't think of a romantic comedy that I've liked this much in while. Hitch is about Alex 'Hitch' Hitchens (Will Smith) and how he has a job as a dating consultant, but falls in love with a gossip columnist, Sara (Eva Mendes), that threatens his business. His main client at the time is Albert (Kevin James), an accountant, who wants to date one of his company's highest profile clients, Allegra Cole (Amber Valetta). Sara tries to get the scoop on the story and that is where she crosses paths with Hitch. Hitch tries to woo Sara, but all of the smooth dating advice he gives to his clients doesn't seem to help, and he has one dating disaster after another.This movie was not overly sweet and cute, and I really liked the way we had to follow two plots to the film. There was the plot of the accountant trying to date his client, who seemed to be out of his league, and there was the story of Hitch and Sara. I never got bored with the movie, and most of the funny moments were actually funny.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Licence to print money,"Among comedic talents, only Jack Black and Will Smith have the ability to carry a picture solely based on their personalities. Ben Stiller needs a good script. Vince Vaughn needs a sidekick. Even Will Ferrell needs some guidance from a director. But put Black or Smith in front of a camera, get out of the way and you'll have a hit. School of Rock was a short film plus an hour of Black mugging with kids  and it worked. In Hitch, Smith is too perfectly cast as a charismatic date doctor who overcomes his alleged fear of love and some weak editing to rake in close to $175M on a $70M budget. The man has played a gay con man (Six Degrees of Separation), one of the most charismatic figures of the 20th century (Ali), an action hero (Enemy of the State, Independence Day) and now a romantic lead. If he chooses to I have no doubt he could become president. That's how much magnetism he has. But somewhere along the way, one hopes he will make some choices to do some edgier material. I mean, c'mon, he could have played this role high on Benadryl. That said, there are some things to recommend here, especially Smith's underrated value as a straight man. When you have the energy Smith has it must be difficult to play second fiddle to another actor, but that is what Smith does in his scenes with Kevin James. Even though I had seen the ads, trailers and TV clips for this one ad nauseum, I still found the dancing scene hilarious, and while obvious credit goes to James, it is Smith's generosity that allows this scene to work. Also interesting are the observations about modern dating that reminded me of an updated Alfie (but not the actual update). Unfortunately, the director working with a sketchy editor and some convoluted writing, got lost along the way and stopped giving us these moments. I'm still not sure why the talking-straight-to-the-camera approach was abandoned. It seemed to work well with this premise. The biggest problem with the story is that we are supposed to believe Hitch, who caught his college girlfriend kissing another dude, has sworn off love because of the incident. This is fine, although it seemed tacked on, but we never see how this transformed him into a guy who will only help men who truly love their prospective mates. How did he learn all these tricks? And how did he make the transformation from geek to stud? But more importantly, if he's sworn off love for himself, but not for others then why does he try to woo Eva Mendes' character? It's not for a booty call, since he went to all the trouble of an elaborate proposal and an even more elaborate date. When it comes down to it, not enough time is invested in these two seemingly perfect people to understand what their problems are. Thus their relationship never seems to be in doubt, a requisite for creating drama. The real story here is James' characters wooing of Allegra. It is sweet, makes a lovely point about being yourself and would have been paid off nicely had the editors not been in such a hurry to rush their moments to get back to Smith and Mendes. All the pieces were here to write a movie on the level of Jerry Maguire, the film they reference here, but they didn't all fit together. But don't worry, the dance sequence at the end will make it worth it and show why Will Smith will someday rule us all.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Have no girlfriend and want a morale booster?,"The only movie I can really compare this to is Rodger Dodger, which was also a 'how to succeed with women' type of movie based in New York City. Why are all these movies in New York? Guess there must be allot of women in that city.In all, this movie was in good-taste and geared towards yonge adults/ or adults, while Rodger Doger was more of an adolescent movie that focused on loose women or taking advantage of drunk women at parties. For those who do not know Rodger Doger - it is a movie about a boy who gets advise from his uncle on hitting on girls - so it is a similar theme. Hitch, on the other hand, the women are rich business women at least or are otherwise at least worth consideration as the type a normal guy should want to marry and not some loose brood or tramp a player would bag and dump, and it is based on winning hearts romantically through props as opposed to bagging as Rodger Dodger was.Is this movie mainly entertainment - or does it have something actually useful to the guys who have no luck with chicks? I think its content - such as a 'seduction date' - where you researched a chick out, find out what her buttons are, and build a date that is full of progressive 'surprises' - is in essence what other seduction text books talk about such as 'how to succeed with women'. Certainly, this is a must see movie for a guy that is having a hard time getting girls - look at this move and you may be encouraged to go out and start hitting on girls again - and learn the word 'perserverance' - that means NEVER GIVE UP - or make your quest to hit a chick dependent on her response. Even the most difficult girls can cave in to you.If you do not understand the word 'perserverance' after viewing this movie - and how it relates to hitting on chicks - you wasted your money - or you need to view it again until you understand it. Now go out there - and find the right girl!!! If you fall flat on your face and feel like giving up - view this movie again and have a laugh and try again. 'nuff said.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Basic Principles--Nothing!!,I remember exactly the day me and couple of my friends saw Hitch in one of my friend's place.We enjoyed throughly.Will Smith was amazing but Eva Mendes was irritating at some scenes.A perfect date movie and a good popcorn stuff.There was no dull moment in the movie.Its surprising to see Will Smith handle his role with a touch of perfection.I never thought he could do such kind of uncharacteristic roles.Kevin James also deserve special mention because almost all the laughs revolve around him.The ending was commendable.What else you expect me say? Go for Hitch and don't forget to see with your girlfriend.7/10 for Hitch--definitely watchable,7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Fast, enjoyable comedy that will leave you feeling happy!","We've seen this plot before many times, but seldom this creatively. The dialog in this film is well above average, as are the set-ups for the ""geeks"" that Hitch (Smith) consuls with meeting the girls of their dreams. How come no women in the film seem need his services? Maybe because they're all fashion models? This film would have been just another ""chick flick"" if not for the wonderful physical comedy of Kevin James as Albert Brenneman, a smart but gawky lawyer who is smitten with an Uma Thurman look alike. If they ever do a feature film about Abbott & Costello, Kevin James really should be cast as Lou Costello.The major attraction of this film is the chemistry between Smith and James, not Smith and Mendes. That interaction is pretty ho-hum and almost incidental to the story. One of the most memorable scenes is the initial meeting between Hitch and Brenneman, when Hitch is ""observing"" him eating lunch. Very funny. Fortunately, the director must have realized this, so there are numerous others.I laughed frequently during this light hearted romantic comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously. Lots of story flaws and some sloppy character development of course, but I left the theater feeling good. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen very often.If you would like to watch another movie that will leave you feeling good about life, try to find a copy of the movie ""DAVE"" at you local video rental store.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly Entertaining,"Dragged to this movie I was feeling hopeless, but this (somewhat predictable) story works. Will Smith is Alex, a matchmaker whose consulting business is based on helping desperate / in-love men create opportunities for seducing the loves of their lives. However, his skills at relationships comes from a sense of revenge and protection rather than his own heart. Alex meets Sara, an equally protective woman who's beautiful and guarded (played very well by Eva Mendes). As you might expect, as Alex helps his main client Albert (played a bit too silly by Kevin James) meet the wealthy and untouchable Allegra (Amber Vallenta does a surprisingly good job for a model), Alex discovers his own heart opening to Sara.Of course there's confusion, a mix-up, some tragedy, and of course resolution all in a neat package. While the final 10 minutes wrap the movie up nice and tidy, the movie is enjoyable as a clichéd dating film, with beautiful scenes of the streets of New York (NYPL, Pastis, Central Park, SoHo, Helmut Lang store, etc.).The soundtrack could have been better, though it wasn't distracting either. There is a Guy Pearce lookalike who plays a sleazebag, and Michael Rappaport (Mr. Superfly from Cop Land) is in briefly as Alex's friend.All the pieces come together and the film, as I said, is surprisingly entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hello Willie!,"Basically a rehash of Gene Kelly's ""Hello, Dolly!"" with a hip 2000s, multi-cultural twist. Will Smith is the intrepid matchmaker who is good at setting up desperate men, but is alone and lonely himself. He falls in love with a cynical gossip page writer (Eva Mendes) who also appears to know much about relationships, but is alone as well. Good moments off and on are overshadowed by an interminable running time and a screenplay that basically chases down its own tail. Sitcom star Kevin James steals the show as a white-collar worker who falls hard for the very wealthy Amber Valletta and does anything and everything to prove his true affections for her. As romantic comedies go, this is pretty mundane. In fact it is pretty mundane as movies in general go. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Romance
"funny but forgettable, over all, not that thats a bad thing , though","i really like will smith, & i will pretty much go see any movie he does, so if you're like me, you'll like this movie, & if you're not, well this movie will definitely not change your mind.its funny, but not hysterical, pretty good, but no where near great, you see where I'm going, right? smith is cool & charming, kevin james is a clutzy spazz, but I'm sure thats what he was going for. this is a pretty good date movie, nothing more, nothing less.its in the same old predictable tired formula of thousands of other similar date / chick flick type movies, but its lack of originality is really no surprise...how many of these type of movies are ever really very original? it doesn't make them bad , but they'll never be great either.i really have nothing bad to say about this movie, but i cant really think of any praises either.its just a middle of the road diversion, i guess.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Smith without a gun - 'bout time!,"I can't tell you how refreshed I felt when I first saw the ad for the new comedy, Hitch. I have long ranted until blue in the face that I was sick of seeing Will Smith with a gun. I, Robot, Bad Boys (I and II), Wild Wild West, Men in Black and Independence Day all were highly successful films (West notwithstanding) that tried to take Smith's charisma and couple it with a holster.But, Will Smith has always been better than most of his filmography would suggest and you don't have to look much further than his Academy Award nominated turn in Ali or his overlooked breakout performance in Six Degrees of Separation to bear witness to the awesome potential of this leading man.So maybe sick of never going more than two scenes without shooting an alien or a drug smuggler or maybe just looking to reintroduce us to the boy that brought the Fresh Prince of Bel Air to our small screens on a weekly basis back in the early 1990's, Smith has elected to star in his first lead comedy of what is still a young career.The result is Hitch, a movie that doesn't strive to be anything better than the ridiculous elements of its premise, but does a good job in delivering the expected goods.Smith plays title character Alex 'Hitch' Hitchens who is a date doctor for the bumbling idiots like myself who need that bit of encouragement, advice or idea to help woo the women of our dreams. Hitch brings to the table what seems to be a wealth of knowledge about the opposite sex and he is all to happy (for a price) to assist in areas of communication, socializing and romancing of the opposite sex.Albert (Kevin James) is one of his prized clients. A large set man that works at a financial firm, Albert was the guy we picked on in dodgeball back in Grade 5. He wears a suit with white socks, he can't seem to eat without spilling sauce on himself and he is love with a rich client that ranks about a nine on the hottie meter. A call to the date doctor was exactly his necessary prescription. In no time, Albert has stood up to his bosses and made an impression with the quasi-celebrity Allegra Cole that was the apple in his eye.But as Albert is basking in the success of his tutelage, Hitch is having difficulty in his personal attempts to impress gossip columnist Sara (Eva Mendes). Their first three dates resulted in the revelation of Sara's murdering great grandfather, an allergic reaction to food that causes Hitch's face to swell and a dinner that ends up in a food fight. An auspicious start to a relationship if there ever was one.So in the confines of the 2-hour running time, Hitch will continue to aide and assist fellow gents in their pursuit of love without revealing his successful revenue generating profession to Sara. And in a conclusion that is just a level above a Three's Company episode, Hitch will become exposed as New York's great relationship sawbones and have to learn a new bag of tricks in an effort to gain the respect and admiration of his new love interest.It will come to no surprise that Hitch is predictable. But the charm is that director, Andy Tennant never tries to raise this film above the obvious. Possibly taking a page from Mel Gibson's What Women Want, the movie plays out like a better than average sitcom with an ending that although seen from a mile away, is enjoyable in its journey.All kudos have to go to the two leads of Smith and James for keeping us interested in a film of characters that must have spent their whole lives bumping into walls only to discover themselves in their middle age. Where Smith is completely believable in his expelling of philosophy and knowledge, James steals the scenes where they are together by introducing us to a vulnerable everyday man who gets a shot at the big time.Hitch is a date movie about dating that will without doubt be another feather in the cap for Mr. July (Smith was branded this title thanks to his 4th of July blockbusters). Coming off of the Oscar nominated Shark Tale, Smith has uncocked his magnum and hopefully put it in the nightstand for at least a few films.And for that, I am thankful.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Subplot,"The main plot evolves around Will Smith and Eva Mendes, but the subplot is where the money is. And it's the only reason that makes the running time look reasonable. The subplot of course involving the ""King of Queens"" actor (Kevin James). His scenes are by far the funniest in the movie!Although you might've seen most of them in the trailer, so they won't seem that funny, when you watch them in the movie. If you're a sucker for romantic comedies or a big Kevin James fan though, you won't mind the running time or the fact that most of the best jokes are in the trailer.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Aims high and hits low....but Will Smith entertains,"This isn't really my kind of flick, but for a silly, savvy date movie - Hitch isn't all that bad. It's obvious that if it wasn't for Will Smith, this movie would never have been made - but he is clearly cut out for roles like this, and even while sleepwalking; Smith proves that he can still entertain. The film tries to leap over it's obvious layer of 'entertainment' and deliver a message that has far more substance than the film does - namely, that love is blind, anyone can fall in love with anyone, love knows no boundaries blah blah blah. To incorporate this message into the plot, the film has had to smother itself in sentiment, and this is what ultimately brings it down. When will filmmakers learn that to make people care, you have to stay away from sentimentality? The scenes that see the characters open up their hearts are largely painful, and this takes away from the film. Hitch does have a surprisingly large amount of things going for it, mostly springing from the performances, but this all falls flat when it starts trying to deliver it's message...with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer in the face.The plotting can, at times, make Hitch hard to enjoy. Some plot points are either left out or not explained very well initially, and this means that the viewer has to try and piece the story together themselves as the film moves on, which can be very annoying. The film is also a good twenty minutes too long. Writer Kevin Bisch obviously wanted this film to be more than it is, and that is shown through the aforementioned 'message' and far too many scenes that go on too long. Still, the writing is actually quite good - and scenes in particular that see Will Smith and Eva Mendes bound dialogue back and forth are good and will please the film's target audience. This film is clearly aimed at the casual movie going public, so it's probably a little unfair to criticise this against it's more serious counterparts, so I wont bother. Will Smith may not be one of the best actors of all time; but he's quite clearly a star. Even from his early days in The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, Smith has stolen scenes and enforced himself throughout, and really; if it weren't for him; this film would have failed.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great date movie,"Hitch is a very funny and entertaining film. Will Smith and Kevin James provide excellent performances and play well off each other.The setting (NYC singles dating scene) rings true, I lived there many years ago. Guess people are still as shallow and vapid as they were then.This movie also avoids gratuitous sex scenes, which is welcome. Families could take their teens.Of course it has a ""message,"" but its a worthwhile one, and not overly syrupy.This film is definitely worth seeing, and you'll leave the theater smiling.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Cure for the Dispirited,"Hitch works well for both genders, as it encompasses movie elements that appeal to either sex.For the women, we have a heady romantic-comedy-sweep-you-off-your-feet formula, designed to get the fairer gender wondering why their current boyfriends/husbands didn't deliver sappy monologues about love and commitment when they first met, and for the men, the rock-solid method of injecting plenty of curves in the way of the female cast, wrapped up in some often-hilarious slapstick and topped with good one-liners. Additionally, Hitch deals with the awkwardness men deal with when meeting women, as gives your average shy-guy the warm fuzzy feeling that any woman is a possible candidate for dating.A good movie to watch with a date (although, not a new or first date: chances are that comparisons will be made with the on-screen romance vs. current romance).",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Ehhhhhhh . . . . Pretty Average Stuff.,"I saw this movie because I promised a friend I would. It was exactly what I expected -- Hollywood is at it again!! Filling a void that doesn't exist, we are confronted with yet another 'romantic comedy.' The unique appeal I guess is supposed to be Will Smith's charisma, but is that really worth $9.50 (in Manhattan theaters)? I guess the answer is - it depends. There is no need to get too involved in the plot. It isn't novel, it isn't even a unique approach to an old idea. The perfect match-maker who is unable to relate to the person of their dreams has been done before(Emma). Is anyone actually naive enough to sit there for two hours biting their nails out of fear that Will Smith WON'T land the babe? Please.Since the plot is entirely inconsequential, what we have is just a vehicle for Smith to exercise his on-screen charm. He is OK, I suppose, but it takes more than one solid performance to make a movie worth watching. I really don't understand American audiences. Alfie was 1000000 times more thought provoking and engaging than this light-weight fare, yet no one went to see it. Maybe people just don't want to be forced to think anymore at the movies?Eva Mendes is nice to look at I suppose and can exhibit warmth that catches you off guard in a positive way. The fat guy from 'the king of queens' isn't bad, but he isn't great either.In the end, if you like Smith and are able to sit back and zone out for a while, you will probably like this movie. If you are a serious fan of cinema, then this movie is like an average slice of pizza. It gets the job done, but you don't really give it too much consideration.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Such crappy dialogue and ridiculous slapstick ending.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
over all junk,"i got to see this movie late last night, the theatre i work at shows new movies for the staff. I had heard that it got good reviews but i was poorly mistaken.Will Smith's role as a match-maker by any means nessecary is basically his worst role since Independence Day. While he tries to help Kevin James with getting his girl, Smith has women troubles of his own, leading to what i believe were supposed to be ""humorous moments"". The only funny things he did was hi-jack a dog and kick a girl in the face.Now, i'm a bit of a fan of Kevin James and i feel disgraced that he would take this role. I'm not sure how anyone could've read the script and thought is was worth making. However, i'm not a total jerk. James's performance was just about the only thing that kept me in the theatre. We got to see a bit of his trademark ""flipping out"" as seen in most of his stand-up, so that was a bit of fun.All in all, the plot wasn't really believable in that James would never be able to get the girl he was chasing. It has it's moments but not many. I suppose it's an OK date movie since it has ""chick flick"" written all over it, and the ladies'll laugh a bit. But if you're by yourself, you're better off seeing Pooh's Heffalump, at least the pain doesn't last as long.",,Anonymous,Romance
A very enjoyable rom-com with fun comedy performances,"I've seen this film quite a few times, and really enjoy it. It's a gentle, fun, funny film, where you don't have to think too much, and you feel good watching it. Perfect for a quiet night in with a cup of tea or a glass of wine (or whatever your poison).It's an ensemble cast film, although Will Smith (Hitch) is undoubtedly the star as he just always seems to carry himself that way. It's therefore a star-vehicle type film reminiscent of old films as there's nothing offensive, and it's light and fluffy - a real romantic comedy. And the comedy is real, and fairly original. The comedy timing between Smith and (Kevin) James has most of the best laughs, particularly where Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta) first comes to Albert Brenaman's Office door... the film, whilst a simple premise, is actually quite clever and an interesting look at dating psychology. A lot of the points made in it are true and it's nice to see a ""chick flick"" dating movie from the man's point of view for a change. Usually it is the girls getting together saying ""why hasn't he called? doesn't he like me?"" etc etc.Eva Mendes plays the female lead, a hard-nosed gossip columnist who has lost faith in love, I guess. I like watching her in films, she's a good actress and of course is very lovely to look at. Her and Smith seem to have good chemistry, especially in the comic moments. I am glad that Jennifer Lopez didn't get the role of Sara Milas as I don't think it would have been as funny, and the chemistry wouldn't have been - perhaps - as entertaining. Valletta's character is fun and not at all stuffy despite who she is supposed to be (also, I just noticed an interesting point in the trivia section about her character name) and how rich etc.There is a lot to laugh at in Hitch, and also admire. The look of the film is attractive, and a great advert for NYC, there's some great picturesque shots and the soundtrack - which is really good - adds to that. It's rather Hollywood in that sense, everything is bright and pretty and idealised, again like the old star vehicle romcom movies. Enjoyable, multi-watchable, laugh out loud funny and possibly educational if you pay attention. It looked like the actors had fun with the film, and that always adds to my enjoyment.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fairly good entry,"When one watches romantic comedies, one knows what to expect; we've seen enough of them over many, many years to know how they go. There's a formula, one which almost always begets movies that become popular with the genre's audience... not always in relation to their actual quality. How to play around with that, and create something more interesting? This movie has a suggestion... and it works relatively well. Instead of simply following a lead, we follow him skillfully helping the unfortunate men, those who lack the attractive facade that would allow them to reveal the unseen good qualities that they possess to the women they are in love with. The plot follows Smith as he works on his self-proclaimed most difficult such case; Kevin James. Alongside his aid of James, we also follow Mendes, who is fed up with men who lie to get what they want(one particular scene that inspires great respect of Smith's character is him meeting one such jerk, and putting him in his place). After seeing Smith helping the disaster that is James, we see him with Mendes... and in spite of his talent for helping others, he messes up... badly... with her. Making a marvelous point about love, and how falling in love affects us. For a romantic comedy, this mostly avoids the pitfalls of such(at times almost bordering on feeling like a spoof of the genre), though the last few scenes has the sweetness and the emotions of this type of films. Whether or not they follow the formula will not be revealed in this review. The pace is quite good, it never really slows down, and seldom moves too fast. The acting is great, as far as pretty much everyone goes. The characters are nicely developed, and come off as real people. The humor doesn't always work... there are occasional gags that are less than fortunately executed, and one or two jokes that seem forced. However, for the most part, the film was funny. I recommend this to anyone who likes romantic comedies and anyone who is or have been in love. Those who do not believe in love will have a difficult time with the last few scenes. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Fanciful without ever feeling too distant or with a distinct, mean-spirited streak; thanks largely to Tennant's good work with the material early on.","Had it been made any worse than what it is, Hitch may well have been a wry; sly; misguided; totally unredeemable; sexist piece of garbage with no redeeming value, whereas had it been produced a little better than what we get, the film may have been a much more nourishing, much more satisfying comedy about relationships and confronting one's fears. As it is, Hitch falls between two stalls, two rather extreme stalls; it isn't by any means a bad film but is one far more underwhelming that it really ought to have been. It's also a lot longer than it has any right to be, Andy Tennant's direction feeding off of a Kevin Bisch screenplay sees Tennant prove fairly quickly that he can negate most of the early stuff to do with set up; quick-fire dialogue and humorous character exchanges. Problem is, by the time everything's slipped off into more serious territory and these people's lives threaten to fall apart as friendships; trust and links break down, the film thinks its carrying more dramatic energy than it actually is and thus, falls a little flat. Regardless, and for the best part, we've come to both care for as well as become a tad fond of the characters on show enough to stick it out.Will Smith plays the titular Hitch, a fast piece of casting in that Smith is an easy guy to get behind and the character of Hitch is somebody we need to observe the good in from the very beginning. Hitch's life effectively sees him stalk women for somewhat of a living; the taking of notes and the careful forming of plans in a calculated manner so as to have them hook up with the poor men whom come to him, so desperately seeking said women, Hitch's line of work. An early sequence renders such a situation one that relies on comic timing and physical comedy more than anything else, when a man's preordained meeting with a woman whose dog goes missing via an elevator mix up in the lobby of a building sees one of Hitch's many plans of action put into motion and successfully working. One day, the man Hitch himself refers to as a project that'll come to resemble his ""Sistine Chapel"", a certain Albert Brennaman played by Kevin James , lands in his lap. His goal: to woo wealthy woman and celebrity Allegra Cole (Valletta) with whom he works at a large company.On another strand, Eva Mendes' Sara Melas is a high powered journalist whom we have to go along with believing that she cannot get a man; something that eerily appears to bother her co-workers more than it does her. Throughout the duration of the film, which is probably a good half an hour too long, their lives and stories will come to entwine with a few harsh truths learnt along the way. The film is one of those to unfold in a New York City that appears to only exist within both the movies and the minds of fanciful would-be tourists whom are yet to venture out to said city, and its something that's grated a lot more in the past with other films than it does here. Additionally, a lot of Smith's to-camera bantering echoes that of Woody Allen during years of old. Tennant and his crew take little time to inform us on where everybody stands regarding Hitch, the notion of such a character existing and doing what he does is addressed very early on. Any ideas of the man being a cold-blooded misogynist, whom despises women because of a prior tragedy at college during which one of them showed him up before coming to uses this lease of life to artfully teach men how to seduce the women they'd usually never get anywhere near, are addressed and banished very quickly: an interaction with one of your more stereotypical New York yuppies at a diner raising the item before having Hitch essentially reject it.We like Albert, principally because he's a little chubby and comes across as a kind of likable enough guy whom wears glasses and has a name like Albert. James and Smith build up quite a rapport, their scenes with each other are far funnier than they have any right to be; his tale to do with the trying to have Allegra notice him sweet and good natured with both the fact we only really realise how much we were enjoying it and how effective it actually was becoming apparent by the time Smith and Mendes' story has overridden it, itself somewhat underwhelming. Like Hitch, Melas is high flying in her chosen career and like Hitch, she sticks to a strict procession of rules that govern her life and job – barely, like Hitch, finding time for a love life. Their coming together and consequent falling apart is entertaining enough; the energy and punch that infuses that first conversation they have at a local night spot at a table sadly only as good as it gets there and then. Later on, a long stretch during which Melas accuses him of being something the film has already gone to extreme lengths to point out he isn't tires us; the physical comedy embedded within the film by this point as equally prominent as it is merely unwelcome. Despite its flaws and pacing problems and the fact a lot of what happens later on might be cured with a simple ""No, it didn't actually happen"", Hitch successfully in a minute manner hooks us up and we enjoy our time with it overall.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Will and Kevin a great match.,"Is Will Smith capable of making bad movies. This is one of his great movies. This is the first time he has ever starred as the lead of a romantic comedy.Kevin James is hilarious in this movie after seeing the movie I must admit I started watching his T.V. show ""King of Queens"" more.This is a very well done plot. Actually being able to have a date doctor is something all men can appreciate it. I think learning the process of what drove Will Smith's character to that profession was great itself.This movie does not take the paths you expect a romantic comedy to take. I love the fact that they take a lot of risks in the plot and in the timing of some of the jokes. This is a great movie.I will forever be a Will Smith fan I guess. Well at least until he makes 2 or 3 bad movie in a row. But right now he still remains king of the summer box office and he's not doing so bad in the Winter either.

Wonderful Movie,"So I decide to watch this movie on TV and I guess I liked this. Will Smith does not do anything slow. It is always right on target with the greatest scripts and comedy that keeps you laughing, and involved in the plot. You are watching a skilled comedian, who plays all his parts well. One fully believes he is who he is playing. The start of this movie is real funny with great jokes. Will Smith and Kevin James have great chemistry in this and it works out nicely. Although Eva Mendes character was really rude and snotty, but she was looking great (plus side. I didn't understand why she was getting so mad at Hitch towards the end, something real weird and confusing.Will Smith seems to have honed his comedy routine well. He was funny. I loved the part where he had an allergic reaction to something he ate, and his face swelled up, and he looked more like some kind of gargle. Then seeing him sipping on the benadryl bottle trying to bring his head back down to the right size. I laughed so hard. He knows how to make us all laugh. Also laughed at Kevin James scenes, he really stole the show (in a good way you f**king dumbases) Id recommend this movie, its great to see.

As a rewatch 08/06/18' over 8 years, Hitch remains a very solid and great stepping stone for Will Smith to show his acting skills. As a result, Hitch was Will Smith at top form, which is a shame considering how his career has went slightly down hill these last few years.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

He's dressed to kill in Hitch (some of us 30 something brothers ought to take notes), and has a great supporting cast that keeps you laughing.Kevin James is hilarious!! He really flexes his acting chops here, and let's the craziness all hang out.Eva Mendez is believable in her role: strong, yet needing male attention.

Hitch's Guide to Love,"The movie ""Hitch"" starts off well, offering genuinely good advice for men on relationships and introducing us to interesting characters. The story follows Hitch (Will Smith), a man who is an expert in dating women, as he takes Albert (Kevin James) under his wing. Normally, Albert would have no chance with the woman he desires (Amber Valletta as Allegra), but with Hitch's guidance, love might just be in the air.Surprisingly, Kevin James delivers a good performance in this movie. Will Smith is his usual charming self, but the chemistry between the two actors really shines. The film has its share of touching, funny, and even romantic moments (just not between James and Smith). When the male leads are doing their comedic parts, the movie is enjoyable, and when it's being truthful, it feels genuine. However, the last third of the film hurts it the most. The story had been avoiding the usual tropes of romantic comedies, but then it turns into a generic romance plot. The inclusion of the big misunderstanding, the chase, the earth-shattering revelations, and the dramatic resolution, all because no one can communicate properly, is frustrating. This movie contains one of my all-time pet peeves, where characters suddenly lose their brains and make the same mistakes we've seen over and over. Despite its good parts, ""Hitch"" falls short of being a truly great, original romantic comedy. (On DVD, October 30, 2012)",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
An outstanding movie!,"Hitch honestly deserves 5 stars. Everything was awesome. Literally flawless.The casting director did the best job. Smith, James and Mendes were spectacular! Nobody overdid their part, and it was all awesome. Everyone had such chemistry with each other.

Will Smith's allergy,"In the movie Hitch, when Will Smith got the allergic reaction to the food, in the drugstore as he was looking in the mirror and the girl was getting medication the infection was on the right side of his face, but in the next scene when he was outside with the lady sipping the medication, it appears the infection was on the left side of his face. I could not tell if the infection was clearing up or not and could not clearly distinguish if the medical problem was in the process of healing. It could have been on the right side of the face but due to the lighting I could not tell. I realize my picture may not have been clear enough. Could you clarify this for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Much Better Rom-Com Than Anticipated,"I came into the movie expecting too much drama and a giggle here and there, but that was not the case. Every man should watch this film just based on the concept. Hitch is the first and only man in history to figure out women, and he passes down his knowledge to those who need his wisdom. Naturally, Will Smith was the perfect casting choice. And Hitch was very funny. The timing was impeccable, and Hitch turned the (actual) dating world on top of its head by revealing the secrets to get a girlfriend that actually made sense and seemed plausible. If you're single and struggling to get a girl, then you will actually feel yourself become a player while watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Much better than I thought it'd be,"I guess I need to stop reading reviews of rom-coms before I decide whether to see them. They are usually my favorite genre of movies, especially when I've had a tough week and I just want to relax and ""escape"" for a couple of hours. Most critics panned this or gave it lukewarm reviews, but several friends of mine had seen it and told me they liked it, so I gave it a try. I am not a huge fan of Will Smith, but I think he did a great job in this movie. He was charming and funny, and he had good chemistry with Eva Mendes. However, the Kevin James/Amber Valletta couple absolutely stole the show. Kevin James has the best moments in the film and he always lit up the screen when he was on. I was also afraid that since I'd seen the trailer for this movie, I'd seen all the best jokes and there was no point (don't you hate when that happens?) but I was wrong. The laughs were evenly spaced with the dramatic moments, and I think men who usually run quickly in the other direction from chick flicks will enjoy this movie. Andy Tennant (director) did a marvelous job on this one. I recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mature Fresh Prince!,"I'm extremely happy that Will has decided to a skip the action parts to return to what he does best, comedy! It would be easy to talk about a return to his Fresh Prince acting style, but that would be unfair since he is a much better actor now. Only one complaint though: this guy has such good self confidence that when he tries to play insecure we just don't believe him. However, he has loads of star quality and really lifts this film to new heights.Even without Will this had probably been a successful romcom, good support from Eva Mendes & especially Kevin James certainly contributed. I laughed out loud several times during this film and left the cinema with a huge smile on my face. That's why this one got a 10 from me!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Hmm, love will find a way?.","Alex Hitchens is a Date Doctor, he helps men to get dates with the women they are too scared to date. His three step rule has a %100 success rate and he is highly sought after by the lonely hearted guys. However when Alex is attracted to gossip columnist Sarah Melas, he finds that his methods and emotions are completely off kilter.It's the inevitability of it all that hurts Hitch, of course going into a film of this type one reasonably should be prepared for what is about to unfold. The trouble here is that the first half of the picture is great great fun, Alex's interplay with the hapless Albert Brennaman is at times hilarious, so much so that when the picture shifts to its inevitable romantic being, it's something of a disappointment. Will Smith {Alex} has a mass of star appeal, and here this is a perfect vehicle for his charming and witty persona, sadly Eva Mendes {Sarah} may look pretty enough but her conviction as a tough female lead here is woefully shy of helping the picture succeed. Hitch holds very few surprises, but one such surprise is the turn from Kevin James as Albert Brennaman, full of comedy vigour he easily steals the honour of best performance in the piece.It's nice enough and one to watch whilst having a glass of wine with your partner, too bad that the syrup eventually glosses over the humour laden beginnings. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Good Rom-Com,"I thoroughly enjoyed Hitch even though most movies that are similar to it I would usually dislike. Hitch stars Will Smith as Alex ""Hitch"" Hichens, a man that people call the ""Date Doctor"" because his job is to help men get a woman to like them in three dates.

Hitch helps him learn the tricks to help him get in with Allegra. Meanwhile, Hitch is having his own dating problems with Sarah Melas (Eva Mendes), a work-a-holic who is obsessed with trying to find out who the ""Date Doctor"" really is.Hitch is a sweet, heart warming movie with good acting and hilarious moments.

Where oh Where was the Script Doctor for the Date Doctor?,"Now and then movies with big name stars and expensive production budgets and PR hype that convince audiences that the Rapture is at hand hit the mat with a thud - and this HITCH is floored in the first half hour (of an overly long two hour movie!). Using a script that uses every cliché from the myriad other films that tell this same story gimmick using females in the Smith role of date doctor, this movie limps along with silly dialogue and pratfall type of comedy, all of which could be forgiven if there was a magical chemistry between the two top stars to make it click.For all the talent Will Smith has demonstrated in the past (despite his recent over the top laffapaloozas like 'I, Robot', 'Men in Black I & II', 'Bad Boys I & II') such as 'Ali', 'Six Degrees of Separation', 'The Legend of Bagger Vance', he seems bent on accepting roles that are beneath him. In this bit of fluff he wastes time talking directly to the audience about the fine art of capturing a girl and then demonstrates his techniques ad infinitum on some blundering characters, ultimately trying to apply his own wisdom in courting Eva Mendes. At this point there should be romantic magic to make this dud work, but the chemistry between the two is so polar that we are forced to wait out a dating game that is less interesting than a Home Depot commercial.The direction is sluggish when it begs to be slick and the acting is rudimentary at best. NOT for fans of the gifts of Will Smith, but if you're in need of a popcorn summer flick to fan away the heat, you might try this lump of ice. Grady Harp",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Sorry, I didn't fall for it.","Will Smith is the world's most popular film star. No, seriously. He is. Statistically, he draws the most customers for Hollywood. It's rumored that every time a Will Smith movie bombs and the statistics drop, so do the film executives  from their skyscrapers. (Just kidding, I made that one up.)They say it's because he's a ""white black."" I don't know what that's supposed to mean, or maybe I do and I just don't want to upset anyone. Hollywood is still a very race-targeted business and Smith himself claimed in an interview that they wouldn't cast an African-American lead opposite him in the film for fear of alienating those stuffy middle-class redneck conservatives. (I am, of course, saying this with tongue planted firmly in cheek.) Instead they opted for Eva Mendes. Bravo, Hollywood.Mendes is very pretty and all, but she shares absolutely zero chemistry with Will Smith. In fact I found most of the film's sequences involving ""Hitch"" (Smith), a successful ""love doctor,"" forced. The funnier moments involved Hitch teaching his protégés how to seduce women  the clownish parts of ""Hitch"" reference a sort of physical, silly comedy in the vein of Chaplin and Keaton (such as when Hitch tries to teach a man how to dance, or more appropriately how not to dance.). That's when ""Hitch"" is at its best.It's at its worst when it's layering on the sugarcoated romantic schlock, and if this flick were a cake, it'd be the fattiest piece of calorie-packed gooey nonnutritive substance ever.""Hitch"" had potential to be different from the other romantic comedies  the ads made it look like it was to be about two sparring love experts (a hook-up doctor and a gossip columnist) battling each other with witty verbal attacks and, in the process, falling helplessly in love. Instead, we get the standard routine:1. Guy gets Girl 2. Girl can't believe how perfect Guy is 3. Guy hides a secret from Girl 4. Girl misunderstands Guy's secret 5. Girl breaks up with Guy 6. Guy reveals Girl was wrong 7. Girl feels bad about her misunderstanding 8. Guy and Girl make upAll you've got to know about ""Hitch"" is the following:1) If you've seen at least one romantic comedy in your lifetime, you will know this inside-out  before you even walk into the theater.2) If you like Will Smith, you might like this.3) If you think Eva Mendes is hot, rent ""Training Day.""Personally, I found this all rather dry. It's not a horrible film, it's not offensive and it doesn't leave a bad taste. Yep, it's nice, gentle and sweet and a good date movie, I suppose.

Original,It's rare to find an original 'romcom' but this is one. It's even more rare to find one that is good but this is one. Originality is very important here and most 'romcoms' today are embarrassingly cliché. But this one is different.The script is good. It took a lot of research and was written meticulously.The secondary characters are actually the main characters. James and Valletta steal the show and they're supposed to.The ending is a bit long and one wishes they'd found a way to speed it up - or rather not have it so unnecessarily drawn out - but there's a punch line at the end and so it's 'almost' worth waiting for.Does Will Smith ever make a bad movie? He can now claim he's made a refreshingly original romantic comedy and that certainly doesn't happen every day. Digging away at the IMDb yields earlier original 'romcoms' like Harry/Sally and Sleepless which are at least fifteen years old - between then and now about all that's happened is Matthew McConaughey. Enough said.This one works and it's been a while. Hats off to everyone on the project.,,Anonymous,Romance

A mediocre romantic comedy with many tedious passages,"This is a corporate Will Smith vehicle. It is a mediocre romantic comedy with many tedious, trite passages. On the positive side, it is inoffensive; devoid of the toilet humor, violence, profanity, nudity, sex and misogyny that infest most modern movies. That means wide variety of people could see this, but if they have any taste, they will be bored and restless. I was having a hard time keeping my eyes open. I was yawning. I was disgusted by the many recycled plot devices and bits of dialog. At times the movie seemed to be made from discarded pieces of ""Jerry McGuire"" and a bad Albert Brooks movie. There was actually a ""poignant disclosure"" scene where the Eva Mendes character tells how her sister ""almost died"" as a child when she fell into an icy river. (These scenes always involve bodies of water.) It's just that witless. I'm guessing that Will Smith ad libbed some of the dialog and had creative input. If so, he's the living embodiment of the Peter Principle. We need to keep a rein on out of control actors. Just because you look good and can stand up in front of a group of people doesn't mean that everything that comes out of your mouth is gold. To be fair, the writer and director of this movie really messed up too.At this point I have to say that the opinion poll here was obviously rigged. There's no possible way that the largest number of viewers chose to give ""Hitch"" a ten. This movie isn't a ten, even to people that liked it. For them, it's a six, maybe a seven. I'm not buying those votes. Somebody at the studio rigged this poll.We have to be thankful for one thing. Luckily Kate Hudson isn't working now, because if she was, this feeble romantic comedy would undoubtedly have starred her and we'd be seeing her modest gifts and plain face once again, as well as hearing about and viewing her each day of our lives, whether we liked it or not.Remember, you can get your money back if you leave a movie in the first part of the movie. Some chains give you fifteen minutes and some half an hour (into the movie itself.) If you're wondering if the movie gets better after that; it doesn't.",,Anonymous,Romance

"Charming Smith, Yummy Mendes and Funny James cannot save this half-baked rom com","HITCH (2005) ** Will Smith, Eva Mendes, Kevin James, Amber Valletta, Adam Arkin, Michael Rapaport, Philip Bosco. So-so romantic comedy  Smith's first by the way (!)  with Big Willie as a matchmaker of sorts in NYC whose latest client (James, arguably the best thing in the film stealing scenes with masterful slapstick and surprising heartfelt emotion), a lovesick mess after the unobtainable gorgeous socialite (Valletta) serves as a parallel to his own sudden infatuation with a feisty gossip columnist (the always yummy Mendes) who proves to be his biggest challenge to date (pun intended). Despite Smith's undeniable charisma coasting through this arbitrary by design screenplay by novice Kevin Bisch (and it shows with some dreadfully leaden sequences that deflate most of the air out of the otherwise occasionally entertaining flick particularly in its final act) and able support (even Valletta is surprisingly good) that alone cannot save the oddly hostility percolating just beneath the surface for a star vehicle. (Dir: Andy Tennant)",,Anonymous,Romance
A Generally Uninspired Love Story,"There is no cure for heartache like love, or maybe just a one-night stand, in ""Hitch,"" a gauzy and serviceable drag directed by romantic comedy connoisseur Andy Tennant (""Sweet Home Alabama""). That at least is the prognosis of Alex Hitchens a k a Hitch a k a Will Smith, a suave New York bachelor who struts his stuff and thankless talents about Lower Manhattan, instructing desperate loner guys how to woo pretty girls. There is no love but narcissism and certainly no satisfaction (or salary), but Mr. Smith seems to be having a grand old time, wearing and owning that familiar lovable goofy smile.Written by newcomer Kevin Bisch, ""Hitch"" makes the most of that lovable goofiness, if not an especially interesting story out of it. As yummy as cotton candy and just as vaporous, the programmatic screenplay more or less follows Albert (Kevin James), a hapless meathead who invokes the help of Hitch to snag the girl he lusts after, a bosomy babe named Allegra (Amber Valletta).Stuff happens — backs are waxed, dance moves are taught, and a gay encounter is hastily averted, along with, effectively, the homosexual tendencies of the main characters. (Whew!) That may make ""Hitch"" no more exciting than the average marshmallow that tends to float in and out of cineplexes these days, but part of the appeal of movies like this one comes from its lack of unfamiliar surprises, its willingness to remain in the warmth and safety of formulaic inspiration while other, more ambitious projects reap the benefits – and sometimes the drawbacks – of venturing out into the unknown.That reluctance grips the film like a vise, holding fast even when Hitch unexpectedly falls for Sara (Eva Mendes), a gossip columnist who at first seems impervious to Hitch's smooth- talking tricks. As it happens, not even this turn of events – the love doctor? infected? – can gather enough momentum to keep the story afloat, but it at least helps prove that Hitch, much like the actor behind him, is one step above your average lady-killer (which I'm sure is the whole point). Affable and charming rather than smarmy and manipulative, Hitch never takes cruel or callous advantage; he'll always choose the tenderness of a real relationship over the meaningless lust of a one-night stand. That good-natured vibe serves Mr. Smith nicely, even when Mr. Bisch's chivalric tendencies border on the saccharine: ""'Hit it and quit it' is not my thing,"" Hitch explains, a twinkle in his eye and a lump of gold in his heart.But there's always a hitch, and one of the problems with ""Hitch"" is that it tediously, systematically goes off without one; it doesn't tease you, enchant you, make you guess and wring your hands, much less dab your eyes or tickle your funny bone. At no point does it run off the tracks, but neither does it go anyplace interesting or new. Instead, it just putt, putt, putts along, riding on the lonely highway of Mr. Tennant's smooth and capable direction. It's competent, or at least competent enough to make the better of its lackadaisical screenplay. It just isn't very good.Neither subtle nor revelatory enough, ""Hitch"" instead emerges as an exemplar of a familiar kind of Hollywood cookie-cutting, thanks largely to Mr. Bisch's reductive screenplay, which lacks both the confidence and creative nerve this sort of chestnut needs to get off the ground. It's a generically banal if wholly high-minded romance flick. It's dumb, it's flat, and the scenes lack snap or wit, which no amount of talent can provide. And unlike ""Sweet Home Alabama,"" Mr. Tennant's last submission to the genre, it also lacks Reese Witherspoon. That's turns out to be especially calamitous, because with the exception of Ms. Mendes, an amiable and underused comic actress, the supporting performances are surprisingly bland. Ms. Mendes, for her part, does her best to charm her audience and pick through the muck with grace, even as the filmmakers reduce her character to assorted platitudes and pratfalls.Throughout much of ""Hitch"" Mr. Bisch dabbles periodically in the stormy and delicate emotions of love, its pleasures, its romps and roiling passions and, most of all, in its heartbreaks, but he tends to avoid tapping into deep wells of emotion. That's to be expected, since Mr. Bisch has yet to learn the true crafts of his trade — namely that true love is not concocted, facilitated, or, worse, prescribed — though here he at least manages to keep his efforts modest and the audience's tender heart unscathed, if unmoved at all.But the heart has its needs, and although Mr. Smith willingly provides the goods — narcotics, mostly — he rarely extends his character beyond the traditional assortment of platitudinous set pieces, teary revelations and cloying matchmaking aperçus. ""Any man has a chance to sweep any woman off her feet; he just needs the right broom,"" he recites graciously near the movie's opening, at which point we're supposed smile at his chivalry and reach for our tissues, not just retch.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Will Smith trying to be Meg Ryan?,"'Hitch' is a silly romantic comedy in which a smart guy (Smith)give expert advise to some shy and naive men to find the better way to gain love affection of his beloved girls. The movie has a weary premise and its development is unfunny and with no bright moments all the way. In fact, this entry seems to be just a tiresome exercise for Will Smith to prove that he has the charisma to play a romantic cardboard character following the path of Meg Ryan. But the outcome is just a boring comedy and a completely dispensable movie. Above all, Will Smith and Eva Mendes has no chemistry between them and the movie is just saved - only sometimes, I must say - by the plot line concerning the love story between the rich Aletta Cole and the funny Albert Brenamann, one of the Hitch's clients.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Hitch"" - It worked for me, but will it work for you?","""Hitch,"" the new romantic comedy directed by Andy Tennant and starring Will Smith, is a delightful film if not completely original, and this is coming from someone who usually hates movies like this and didn't have the slightest hopes of liking it. For one, Smith is one of the most likable personalities in current popular entertainment, and I found him to be quite appealing as the lead character of the film's title.To collect my thoughts, I had to watch ""Hitch"" twice before I felt that I could accurately relay its effect on me into this comment. ""Hitch"" worked for me because, I myself, fall more or less into the category of men that date doctor Alex ""Hitch"" Hitchens (Smith) helps with their dating woes and who desperately need to meet a special woman at the office, next door, or just saw walking down the street.But as stated earlier, I usually detest Hollywood romantic comedies, especially one as by-the-numbers as ""Hitch,"" but damn it, it worked both times I viewed the movie. My highly critical and skeptical expectations of no-joy were proved wrong on both occasions and now I feel that ""Hitch"" could be required viewing for any one guy that desperate for a gal.To quote Hitch, ""If there was ever a man born without game, it was Albert Brennaman (Kevin James),"" and this leads into part of the film's main plot. Albert is the screen epitome of the Lonely Guy (almost too convincing, if you ask me) and the film takes great liberty in showcasing his comedic social ineptitude and clumsiness around beautiful women.He's Hitch's latest client, and he wants to hook up with the lovely celebrity heiress Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta) a la Paris Hilton. Albert works as one of Allegra's many yes-men account consultants and he desperately wants a date with her since she just ended a relationship and the tabloids are all over her every movement like a broom.Albert's attempts with Allegra are paralleled by Hitch's own dating insecurities, in which his current romantic entanglement is with a pretty but man-cynical gossip columnist named Sara Milas (Eva Mendes). The budding romance that develops between the two is sweet and touching but as with all Hollywood love stories, is destined to run into trouble. And trouble comes along when the plot reveals that Sara is determined to expose the notorious New York date doctor, who of course unknown to her, is tall, dark & handsome Hitch. The results of the encounter, as the plot would require, are not pretty.""Hitch"" works largely because of the likability of its screen stars (Smith, who I've already mentioned), Eva Mendes as his love interest, and the hapless Kevin James as Albert. All three do wonders for their respective roles and the film is the better for that. But the success lie in its timing: the movie was released the weekend before Valentine's Day! So ""Hitch"" WOULD make for a great date movie and I'm sure that's what it's going to go down in cinematic history as.Any complaints? Yeah, why not. The biggest misstep ""Hitch"" suffers from is its story, which ironic as it seems, is very fun and sharp, but ultimately uneven. The romance between the two leads is good, fun and wholesome, but the subplot with Albert and Allegra, to me, is far more interesting. I wanted to see their relationship become a lot more developed, but more time seemed devoted to Hitch and his relationship with Sara. The film seems to focus more on Hitch and Sara than it does Albert and Allegra, who I'd been led beforehand to believe the story was really about.But with that aside, ""Hitch"" is still fun to watch. Then there is the lingering question of the validity of Hitch's information. Will it work for Lonely Guy? Maybe, but a woman who watches this movie might be warm to his intentions. So it might be wise for him to steer clear of Hitch's advice, if he knows what's good for him.But still, if only more guys like Hitch existed in real life too and were able to give credible dating advice...8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

good but predictable,"has anyone else noticed that in American romantic comedies the plot has always been the same. boy meets girl at first they spar, then start falling in love and by act three every time either one or sometimes both of them does something to the other one usually out of ignorance or a misunderstanding, they fight one tries to make up the other rejects the advance only to realise a little later that he/she was wrong and that this is it, to the inevitable happy ending. now i do not know of any romance that withing its first few days/weeks/months where the couple fall out, this starts happening after the honeymoon period be it six months or over a year. but Hollywood has used the plot development in every romantic comedy for the last ten years at least. when eva mendes publishes the cruel and untrue story about albert and hitch, it is totally out of character has no basis in fact, in fact her assumptions about hitch are not based on anything, so why should she do it. up to then i really enjoyed the film, even though i knew they were going to play the last reel in the way that they did. shame really that we no have all these set formulas for each respective genre. this is marketing not movie making. but the punters lap it up and keep lapping it up.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Another formulaic Rom-Com.,"I must say before anything else that Will Smith is a true movie star. If this was made w/any other actor in his role, it would have done less than 1/10 of the business. This is another film that supposedly comes up w/a new idea yet when all is said and done it's just a rehash of a plain ol' romantic comedy. What this had going for it was all of the leads are good including Smith, Eva Mendes, Kevin James, & the highly underrated it's only a matter of time before she is a star Amber Valetta. This is a quite straightforward film w/no real surprises & nothing to take with you either. This is definition of fluff, nothing deep (not that it's supposed to be) you won't think about it, & will forget it as soon as you see it. I like Rom-Com's if they can offer something new or at least new-ISH. This is not it. I love ya Will, but here's hoping he will do something good again. ""I am Legend"" weak, ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" terribly overrated & worst of all as of late ""Hancock,"" considering the obscene amount of money it made $624 million WORLDWIDE considering it's extremely bizarro 90 minute plot. This is another giant hit he's had over the past half dozen years, but none of them really have any substance. Here's hoping he doesn't play it safe much longer although you got to give him props for trying something different in the incomprehensible ""7 Pounds.""",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Poor Film,I see and understand what the crew were thinking and trying to do when they were creating this film but it was too basic and simple and straightforward and weak. The storyline of this film was confusing and did not have any real direction at all. The cast selection could have been a lot better and stronger. They did not exactly fully commit nor connect to the storyline nor to their respective characters. There was not any sign of real chemistry displayed throughout this entire poor film between the cast members. This is a poor film that should never have been created.

A good Will Smith comedy,"This film attracted a lot of positive reviews at the time of its release, and quite rightly so, it is a good comedy with an original premise, as well as boasting a good performance from Will Smith.It's a unique take on the romantic comedy, and allows Smith to use the comedy skills that he honed on his TV show 'The Fresh Prince of Bel Air'.One of the joys of this film is that Smith is paired up with the equally funny Kevin James (of 'King of Queens' fame) and their dynamic produces some strong moments.It's perhaps a little overlong, but on the whole this was a good comedy.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very cute and a perfect Valentine's Day movie,"I saw an advanced screening of Hitch Monday night because I am reviewing it for my college paper. Its a very cute romantic comedy. The script is a little corny but all of the cast knows what they're there to do and they pull it off very well. Its also got a lot of hysterical physical comedy from Kevin James and Will Smith seems like the Fresh Prince again, making funny faces, letting loose and being silly. All of the cast have great chemistry and this feels like a truly modern romantic comedy; its fresh and in the time period, yet familiar. I'd say go to enjoy yourself and to have fun. The movie feels a little long by the end, but after the final scene, its all worth it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Smith Rules,"Will Smith can carry a movie all by himself, even this one that had few funny moments. It is billed as a comedy after all. The selection of Kevin James remains a mystery to me. The man is not funny, telegraphs everything he does, and he essentially tries too hard to be funny and fails miserably. I can only offer this advice to him: go back and watch the masters, Chaplin, Gleason, Blue, etc and learn timing from them. And, yes, watching reruns of the Friends TV show may help too. Failing that go to drama or sell cars.The only funny thing I found in this ""romantic comedy"" was when Hitch eats some food and discovers that he is allergic to whatever it was he ate. His reaction and facial changes were actually laugh out loud funny. I guess this catches us by surprise. Also, Hitch gives some very good lines (advice to the men he is helping) and there may be some truth to some of them.OK, aside from the movie not being funny except for the food allergy scene, this is a fairly good story. Hitch and tabloid reporter (Mendes, who is very beautiful, by the way) try to get it on with the usual girl-boy point and counter point sparring. The sparring part of it is good, but the love angle doesn't work here. No one is focused enough for that. This is the part that is most ironical too. Hitch always professes to the guy he is helping to be ""focused"" (toward the girl) and here (as actor Smith) playing the part he is not focused enough for the audience to see he has feelings for Mendes. Oh, he goes through the usual love-pain gyrations, but it just didn't seem real for me. Sorry. Maybe he knows Jada (his real wife) will be watching.The supporting cast aside from James all did a very good job. Will Smith is very talented and I truly believe he would make an excellent James Bond. This has nothing to do with this movie. I just needed to say it. Smith rules.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

By the way, it's incredible, but a fact - most of the tips from this film regarding the conquest of women's hearts work in real life. This film can be safely put 10/10 and despite the fact that the 2005 film, i.e. 17 years have passed since the release of the film, the picture still looks good. Will Smith, as always, looks great in the frame. Feel free to put this movie 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Get ""Hitch-ed!!!!!!""","Based upon what I saw in the trailers, my assumptions about the movie was that it would be yet another example of Hollywood's predilection with formulaic scriptwriting and lame comedies.Boy, was I wrong, and glad of it, too! Most of the syndicated movie critics (and IMDb reviewers here) have tended to focus primarily on the performances of Smith and Eva Mendez. Since Will Smith is one of my favorite actors, comedic or otherwise, I felt that his presence could do nothing but help any film, no matter how bad. Yet, I really loved this film, and it is due mostly to the break-out performance turned in by Kevin James.I have never watched the TV show, ""King of Queens,"" because I think of it as a ""Raymond"" rip-off. Consequently, I knew virtually nothing about the comedic talents of Kevin James. He can do the kind of physical shtick that made Chris Farley famous, but unlike that one-dimensional SNL player, James can also turn in a whole range of emotional and psychological performances.James is a comedic genius and steals every scene he is in, but does so in a way that endears himself to the audience. He does so by always turning the focus back to Smith. In both the fictional world of the movie’s story, and the reality of working in a movie with an A-list star, James knows how to defer to the lead of his partner and mentor.“Hitch” is first and foremost, a buddy movie, and the comedic timing and chemistry between Smith and James is the best I have seen in many years. Unfortunately, there is not enough of Smith and James on screen to satisfy this movie-goer.Smith plays Alex Hitchens (known only as “Hitch” by his clients and friends), a date counselor whose job it is to help romantically-challenged, and socially inept guys get the girl of their dreams. In the film’s beginning, Hitch meets a new client named Albert Brennerman (Kevin James) who turns out to be Hitch’s his greatest challenge to date The problem for Brennerman, and for his counselor, Hitch, is that he is head-over-heels in love with a beautiful, and filthy rich celebrity named Allegra – a woman who could get any man she wants. Brennerman has the good fortune to work for an accounting firm that has taken on Allegra as its new client.Initially, Hitch has gave doubts that Albert could land any member of the opposite sex, let alone superstar Allegra. Yet, Hitch seems to relate to hopeless situations, and takes Albert on as his client. What follows is one of the funniest guy-to-guy relationships to ever be seen on screen.Both Smith and James are likable individuals in their own right, and their characters reflect those likable traits as well. They play off each other in a way rarely seen on screen since the Lethal Weapon duo of Gibson and Glover.The other subplot in the movie concerns a budding love relationship between Smith and a gossip column reporter who works for a local tabloid similar to the Enquirer. Although there are also lots of laughs to be found in this part of the film, and although the chemistry between actors Smith and Mendez seems genuine, their appearances on screen break up the overall continuity, and relies too much on Hollywood formulaic scriptwriting to get through it. Plus, their on-screen time takes away the time that would be spent between Smith and James.I whole heartily recommend this film. It is the most delightful film I have seen all year. Although one might classify this as a “date-film,” I see no need to take a partner with you when you go.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Another Wil Smith film,"""Hitch"" is a romantic comedy vehicle for Wil Smith. It has some interesting ideas and does a wonderful job of capturing the magical New York as it's back drop. Smith is very good as a leading man and comic relief and he is both in this film. Playing a ""romance"" consultant for guys who are hopeless, he is a Guru who knows of what he preaches. We find that his near scientific knowledge of wooing the fairer sex comes from a particularly devastating experience he had when he was younger and that it is his mission to help others who are truly looking for romance(he draws the line at helping those with less savory intentions). Smith finds his suaveness and his own savvy becoming useless when he comes across a gossip reporter who is tracking down an heiress who is dating one of his clients played by the always hilarious Kevin James. The problem with the film is that it resorts to goofy, slapstick humor when all else fails(the shellfish allergy scene is an example of this). Also, the chemistry between Smith and Eva Mendes is not convincing. This is no reflection on either actor but there was no convincing conflict between the two. All in all, this is yet another vehicle but Kevin James did steal every scene he was in and brought the funny to a movie that is merely standard, assembly line, multi-plex fare.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

An important lesson in romance education,"Hitch tells the story of a man who helps other men to get a chance to do the right thing when it comes to getting the right women. When he himself finds the right women, who is a journalist, his business falls apart.This film has the same fun education in life as Sex and the City. It's light, hilarious, sweet and interesting. The performances from the actors are neither over the top or underacted. The film runs smoothly, turns to dramatic sides on occasions and is filmed in the Big Apple as many other films are.Will Smith's first attempt at a romantic comedy is a pleasant surprise and a success. He has a magnetic charm that makes the audience feel comfortable. Eva Mendes plays a tough realist journalist who also has a few vulnerabilities of her own as Hitch does.Hitch also shows that a small little nobody like Albert Brenneman (Kevin Smith) can get a chance with a celebrity such as Alegra Cole. It shows that anybody anywhere can get a chance to find the perfect partner.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Here's the 'Hitch' - we don't need this whole thing...,"... Watching this reminded me of those old Doris Day confections that this film desperately wants to be like; you know, the kind of thing where the dapper columnist wines and dines their target in search of the perfect 'expose', only to wind up falling for them in the process... Then I thought back to previous modern-day interpretations. Guess what? I couldn't come up with any. The closest I got was ""Down with Love""; which technically doesn't count, since it's more of a sly tribute than a fresh look...Now there's Hitch, though; and it demonstrates perfectly why this type of tale isn't really attempted, anymore. In this day and age, we have all sorts of conveniences to help the romantically inept - not least of which is the Internet; and the film never managed to convince me why people in need of help would turn to Hitch over more anonymous - and less expensive - alternatives...I guess the answer that's closest to the truth, if not actually overtly spelt out, is ""because he's Will Smith"". There again, the producers (included Will himself) have sensed a soft target of ladies who usually swoon, and guys who normally laugh, at the 'Fresh Prince' himself; 'cept that wasn't how it went down - at least not for me.It must have seemed like an all-too-safe bet to attach Will Smith to a romantic comedy and let him breeze through scenes with his easy charm and flair for drawing a chuckle. So much so that the end result is HORRENDOUSLY 'pre-packaged'; with his role not being so much a character as a marketing man's idea of how best to sell 'Will the Romantic'. I was left feeling short-changed because I wanted some real personal insight; instead the effort was to sell me the same superficial patter as his desperate potential clients - only I wasn't buying...That's the predictable romance covered; and because it's a different genre, the script doesn't make an effort to give us a whole lot of laughs, either. The attitude seems to be: ""Well, we've written the romance, and we've got Will to make people laugh... "", but in truth; there's not much for him to work with.This is apparently an indicator of things to come; a preview of what will happen when Mr. Smith hangs up his 'cape', and stops trying to save the world. He supposedly made the switch on the advice of his son. Well maybe when the lad gets older he'll realise that this is NOT the best way for affairs of the heart to resolve themselves; being as it is commercial and insincere, when what the real softies amongst us would like to see more of are great big helpings of emotional truth...",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Good story, good acting, good information!!","Hitch is like no comedy you'll have ever seen before. Its a comedy, yet it is also sweet and sometimes sad. Hitch stars Will Smith in his typical role, funny guy with slapstick as an extra and a very good feature debut from Kevin James, a surprisingly good convincing actor. In the ladies section is supermodel Amber Valletta and Eva Mendes both delivering memorable performances in their own separate ways.The film is about New York City's greatest date doctor Alex Hitchins (Will Smith) aka ""Hitch"" fixing up guys that don't seem to have a chance with gorgeous women but give them hope and advice to pursue their dreams. Hitch's newest client is Albert Brennaman (Kevin James) a not so fit guy who falls madly in love with a gorgeous, rich society heiress Allegra Cole (Valletta). But simultaneously Hitch finds himself a nice lady who happens to be a tabloid gossip reporter, called Sara Melas (Eva Mendes). Obviously a date doctor is a great story and she decides to uncover more about this renowned data doctor. And thus starts all the drama and trouble for our little Hitch, who just doesn't lose hope for her.Combined with good actors and dialogue Hitch brings you the ""cure for the common man"" with good advice I think and a good atmosphere to the hole film which is a very pleasant experience indeed.

The perfect romantic comedy,"Hitch is an amazing, light romantic comedy. I was suspicious at first, but Smith's character Alex Hitchen charmed me right away. He works with actually nice men who want a relationship instead of a- holes, which is the key element that makes the character lovable. Mostly this movie works because of the characters. Hitchen is sweet, clever and honestly seems like the perfect man. Sara is clever, and while she has some typical romantic comedy tropes, she's still quite well written. All relevant characters grow significantly during the film. And it's amazing to see a romantic comedy about a black guy and a Latina woman without any annoying racial stereotypes - though of course I am no expert on this, so feel free to correct me.Hitch just is an excellent movie. It's the perfect romantic comedy. It's sometimes ridiculous, but also genuinely funny. And it's so sweet and I enjoyed almost every second of it. apart from the typical plot structure, and those few moments that almost frightened me that the film wouldn't go the way I'd want it to - because when you're watching romantic comedies, it's important the films don't just knock you to the ground. They are for fun, and the audience doesn't necessarily need some huge plot twist that the writers came up with just so they could change the whole genre and be fake artsy.In short this is a really nice movie, something I genuinely liked, even if I sometimes am a bit cynical towards romantic comedies. This movie made me smile and feel all warm inside. I definitely recommend this.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
No Pitch for Stitch,"You know the old story. So and so can help anyone except himself. We find it again in Hitch, a silly movie about basically silly characters.The best scene of this poor film is probably at Ellis Island.Will Smith is certainly no Dear Abby. His help almost backfires on him.The character Allegra, to me, was deadpan. With that name, she would be more needed to clear up my allergic reaction to this film.I love the way that characters, who supposedly can't dance, can dance up a storm, especially when they're playing fat nerdy type individuals. Even the psychiatrist character in the film needs help. I still can't figure out her brief over-the-top hysterical outburst. Maybe, the film would have better been served with a Barbra Streisand like rendition of ""People needing people."" This film, for sure, needs a complete makeover. *.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Best movie I've seen in the theaters for a while!,"This is definitely the best movie I've seen in the theaters for quite some time now, probably the best since Spiderman 2, The Stepford Wides, and Harry Potter: Prisoner of Azkaban.It was definitely a chick flick but I'm the kind of guy who enjoys a good romantic comedy. Will Smith was able to play someone who wasn't a complete cocky ""hardass"" agent in some worldwide anti-alien conspiracy for once which surprised me. It was a very funny movie and I have to say the Albert character was best. I wish there was more of him and less of Will Smith's character, Alex Hitchens. Perhaps that's because I, like Albert, have a penchant for spilling food on myself.I'd recommend this movie to almost anyone, except hardcore angsty teenage cynics with pierced brains who hate anything happy.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Amazing movie considering its a chick flick,"I was amazed at how much I really enjoyed this movie, not only was it a funny movie but I felt I could relate to some of the guys who Hitch coaches in the sense of being a hopeless romantic but being to nervous to go up to a woman and ask her out or even offer to buy her a drink. Personally I can't think of anyone better than Will Smith to play the lead role because you look at movies like Bad Boys 1 & 2 and you can see his natural talent for being smooth with women in those films and you can tell its not just acting. as far as leading lady goes Eva Mendes was a good choice because she is so hot and yet she has an everyday look unlike some of the other actresses around today who could of played her role, I mean come on guy admit it you would feel intimidated walking up to a woman with her looks and asking her if she has a lighter you could use to light a cig let alone ask her for a date. I would suggest any guys reading this before taking a partner or date out to taking her to see this movie its a total chick flick but its easy for a guy to like as well.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Adds nothing new to the genre,"In ""Hitch,"" a predictable script and some surprisingly uninspired acting bog down an interesting concept.For starters, this film runs way too long for a romantic comedy. It overstays its welcome around the 95-minute mark, but then continues on for another 20 minutes or so. And those 20 minutes aren't anything spectacular; in fact, they're rather mundane.Romantic comedies, by their very nature, are utterly predictable. Occasionally, you find one that goes against the norm, that tosses in unexpected twists and ends unconventionally. But those tend to be independent films; Hollywood surely won't risk making something as daring as an original idea.This is another film that attempts to get by on its stars' charisma. And Will Smith and Eva Mendes have enough screen presence to pique our interest. But together, they fall flat. Smith's trying way too hard to be funny and you know this film's in trouble when Kevin James' overacting gives us the funniest moments.Of course, I didn't watch this movie expecting Hepburn and Tracy or even Allen and Keaton. But apparently everything that's even mildly amusing already was in the trailer. The rest of the film just sort of ambles along at a leisurely pace, occasionally making us smile. There aren't any huge laughs, any unexpected moments, anything even remotely original.Smith and Mendes surely deserve better material than this.Hollywood keeps lamenting that box-office receipts are down this year. There's a reason for that. The movies Hollywood studios are churning out don't make me want to rush out and seem them. If studios put out better product, maybe we will be keener on seeing those movies.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

A good movie that flowed without a hitch,"OK, OK, I must say I was impressed. It's hard to say what I'm more impressed with: my ability to choose the right romantic comedy to watch so that I don't gouge my eyes out, or the movie itself. Either way, ""Hitch"" was pretty darn good. Hey, it was good enough for me to watch twice. Will Smith was funny and good. Kevin James was just hilarious, and absolutely essential for the movie. As much as this movie centered around Hitch (Will Smith), without Kevin James it's just not the same.The story is: Hitch is a match maker that helps the guy woo the girl. His job is to create the chance for the girl to notice the guy when she otherwise wouldn't. After the encounter, the rest is all up to the guy to make or break the relationship. He works on referral only and stays largely unnoticed during the process. Albert (Kevin James) is Hitch's project this time around, and Albert has eyes on Allegra Cole (Amber Valleta) a Paris Hilton type figure. While that plot unfolds, Hitch himself has eyes on Sara (Eva Mendes), a sharp, independent, fanged gossip columnist that wants nothing to do with a relationship.The two stories make for some funny moments and they tie together for a bit of a quagmire. Of course no love story is complete without the obligatory miscommunication, misunderstanding, or mishap to send the guy chasing after the girl. Fortunately, they make it brief and unsappy. Hitch was a fun and funny movie that flowed very well and rolled along without a hitch.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bad,"It's really bad. Funny a few rare times, hence the 3 and not a 1.Overplaying is an understatement here. The worst of all being Kevin James. And no, his character is not adorable. He's just obsessed, goofy and creepy.Amber Valletta and Eva Mendes are very beautiful but that does not save the script. The former avoids the overplaying that mars the film. The latter does not.And Will Smith is Will Smith, the package we've seen in each of his movies.The cringe factor is a solid 9; the humor is a 3 (if forgetting the awful Kevin James' version of slapstick comedy); the romance is too awkward to be more than a 3.Crazy, Stupid, Love was much better.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly exceptional !!!!,"This movie is , in its genre, extremely well conceived. Not boring for a moment. Even the ""clichés"" of the genre are used relevantly. Will Smith is extremely convincing as usual. He plays incredibly well and he will, without the slightest doubt entertain everyone. And Kevin James perfectly fit in his role. Eva Mendes is terribly seducing. The story is never too far fetched and totally respond to what every film of this type should be. Entertaining, funny, catching from beginning to end. I have to admit that Hitch is the better comedy I've seen for a long time.Definitely a refreshing comedy!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Overdone,"It's trite, it's simple, it's clichéd, it's predictable ... just like the Jennifer (Alias) Garner vehicle 13 GOING ON 30. I don't know how much Mark Ruffalo was paid for that movie, but it's a bummer that Kevin James would get caught up in this mess and so would Michael Rapaport of Copland (Superfly!) fame.Oh well ... I got dragged into this tongue-in-cheek ""ha-ha"" flick and unfortunately enjoyed it despite the so-so acting. Everything was so polished, somehow the studios managed to sneak one by us.The editing was fairly good, as was the soundtrack. The abundance of ""hot women"" never hurts, but Will Smith does just enough to get by (and get paid).",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
A good night out.,"Is there such a thing as a Guy ""Chick flick"" - Good humoured movie with great ending for a pleasant night at the movies. My wife usually avoids Will Smith, but the story line and overall composition was pleasant enough for her to enjoy as well. Kevin James' performance as the funny guy to Will's straight guy, was a great balance. Some quite reasonable acting from some good looking on-screen ladies help balance the film out to be middle of the road. Extremist fans (of any genre), those looking for brain stretching dialogue, cinematic excellence or Cannes Award winning drama will be disappointed. But I think there should be more of these gentle pro-relationship films.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mediocre film-making and a very clichéd plot.,"But was it funny? A few bits here and there were okay. Is it worth seeing? I'd say not really. It was generally watchable but then it was also unnecessarily long (it drags towards the end) and the potential of the story's idea is crushed by the movie's onslaught of clichés. The actors are likable enough (especially Kevin James) although Will Smith isn't at his best and Eva Mendes' character didn't quite convince me (probably the script's fault).I think Hitch is a good example in some ways of how over ambitious film-making can ruin a perfectly good idea. I don't think there's anything wrong with wanting to put as many good ideas as you can into a movie but you also have to be able to recognise whether they work or not; you have to be aware of your own limitations and work to your strengths. For me, much of the ""clever"" dialogue came across as forced and a bit lacking in subtlety (perhaps some better acting could have made this less noticeable). I also thought the cinematography was quite boring and unimaginative. Of course, one could argue that's not at all important in a comedy movie like Hitch but it can make the difference between an effortlessly engaging film and one that has the audience fidgeting and checking their watch half the time.One of the primary ways in which I found Hitch to be typical and predictable was in its score. There seems to be a trend as of late with comedy in TV shows and movies where the music consists mainly of pizzicato strings playing a kind of waltz that constantly stops and starts and is intentionally ""quirky"". Desperate Housewives is probably the undisputed leader in this field (from my experience). The scene in the boardroom with Kevin James' outburst has this kind of insidious music that I'm referring to. It's obvious and lazy and terribly clichéd. On the contrary, some of the songs used were really good (""(What a) Wonderful World"" and ""You Can Get it if You Really Want"" right near the start) but I still felt as though there was this disconnection between the music and the movie (which makes it all the more difficult for the audience to get into it).One other complaint would simply be the lack of comedic ideas in the movie. The central idea could make for any number of hilarious situations but the script is frustratingly tame and cheesy. Had Hitch been more content with being an entertaining and silly comedy, the director's style not gotten in the way of the characters and the script been a bit more adventurous (and funny!), it could have been a good movie. But other than a couple of fairly enjoyable little parts, as it is I felt like it was a complete waste of time.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beyond my expectation,"Having read the mixed reviews for the movie by the critics, I thought that watching this movie will waste my money and time.

He's so cool and groovy, I just want to be like him... Anyways, going back to my point, this movie is very original and the script is refreshing. It is a date movie, yes, but it is still a comedy.I just don't know why it received mixed reviews... I think probably because of its predictability?

Will Smith and Kevin James are the Best combo in a long time!,I would never imagined these two being in a movie together. It was like the two of them had been acting together for years. I was laughing so hard I was in tears. Very good movie and I hope they team up again in the future. I have been a Will Smith fan ever since Independence Day. I love Kevin James on his TV show and the duo was one of the best I have ever seen. I though the punch lines thru the entire file were very good. I can honestly say that there never was a dull moment. From start to finish this film ranks up there with all the other comedy's in the last 10 years. The rest of the cast including a very pretty Eva M. was very good too. She had more than a supporting role and she did a wonderful job. 10 Stars,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Any Guy Can Sweep Any Girl Off Her Feet,"The film follows the artist formally known as the Fresh Prince (sadly D.J. Jazzy Jeff is nowhere to be found) around as the mystical Date Doctor as he helps the hapless men of New York land the girl of their dreams because as Hitch says, ""Any guy can sweep any girl off her feet, he just needs the right broom."" His latest client also stands to be his biggest triumph as a goofy account Albert, played by Kevin James hires Hitch to help catch the eye of the socialite, Allegra Cole, who is a client at his firm. But with about ten other accountants on her case, it's hard for Albert to stick out. Granted whenever Allegra's name was brought up I couldn't help wondering how much the filmmakers were getting paid from pharmaceutical industry.But Hitch's greatest success could be in trouble when he meets a jaded woman that he tries to woo who just so happens to have a gossip column that regularly focuses on Allegra's dating life. But since this is a romantic comedy, hilarity ensues instead, or at least tries too. The movie tries a little too hard at the physical which is fine when James is on screen, but when it's left up to the Fresh Prince and Eva Mendez as the gossip maven, it sometimes fall flat.Overall it was a decent movie with a couple good laughs even though most of the movie, much like every romantic comedy, was extremely predictable. There were also a few scenes that didn't really need to be in the movie like Hitch's flashback to his dorkier college days or the scene with movie killer Michael Rapaport. As for the extras on the DVD, there were a couple of run of the mil featurettes and boring deleted scenes that were rightfully left on the cutting room floor along with your typical gag reel. Also there was a video for 2005's summer anthem, Amerie's 1 Thing.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Rom-Com you cannot miss,"If ""Hitch"" has been one of those movies which has sitting in your Watchlist for a while or if you're just one of those who has no idea what's good on Netflix, well then there's no need to give it a second thought. Hitch is the definition of how funny and enjoyable Rom-Com should look like-- without regarding your age or gender. The script is funny, original and plus it goes smoothly with the flow of the entire film. As for the plot, it can definitely be labeled as something engaging for that it places you in the shoes of most of the characters with their different perspectives in life. In short it takes you through an interesting part of both cupid's and the target's life showing you how several humane mistakes can play to your advantage and disadvantage as well.

Great Will Smith Movie Since Men in Black,"Wow, I was really surprised that this movie was enjoyable.

Turns out he's really good in this, not too stuffy or mechanic (like in the Spielberg robot movie) and the girls does a good job. Solid chemistry between the two characters and the fat guy from the TV show is funny as well. Predictable plot but worth seeing, for 7 bucks! Bring your own popcorn else wait for the DVD.

Best romantic movie ever made period,The best romantic movie ever. Hitch is everything you would look for in a comedy and in a romantic movie this is definitely a surprise. I did not know Will Smith could do a romantic movie but he proved me way wrong and now it is one of my favorite movies ever no doubt my favorite romantic movie. But anyway this is a movie that every guy would like to see and believe me those tips that Hitch gives you in that movie really works. Hitch is a must see movie of the year and is in my mind Oscar material. Eva Mendas did a great job of playing a mean bitch/loving girlfriend and Alan Breneman was hilarious and combined with hitch it's an awesome combo. This movie shows you that whatever you put your mind to you can achieve. This movie is a great couple film but not really a children's film.9/10 stars,8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Funny, cute romantic comedy","Will Smith's 2005 romantic comedy Hitch is cute and at times pretty funny. I enjoyed smith's performance, he is perfect for the lead role, funny when he needs to be and charming when it calls for it. Eva Mendes is great here too, I loved the way she approached the role, you can tell she is pretty resistant to love and a potential relationship, she has become very bitter and closed off to the notion of a long term relationship. But of course that all changes when she meets hitch (will smith). Kevin James is funny as always, love his dancing here, that was a really cute/funny thing because yes it's amusing but it also ended up a thing that Allegra was attracted to, and that among other things makes their relationship work. Amber Valletta plays her role nicely and I think that her and James's on screen chemistry works very well, they just have a natural likability to them as a couple. The same thing goes for Mendes and Smith. So yes some parts are predictable and some of it is just run of the mill romantic comedy style content that you've seen before, but I think that even though it has some predictability, it is still a very funny and entertaining film that deserves a watch, especially if you're a fan of the cast or a big rom com fan. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly funny!,"I avoided this movie when it hit the theaters because the critics panned it. I shouldn't have listened to them. Okay, maybe the story line was a bit of a stereotype--the love doctor helps others fall in love but he doesn't take his own advice. But overlook that, and you'll enjoy a great romantic comedy. It wasn't Will Smith that was so hilarious--although he had a few moments--it was his co-stars who who were so funny. Especially his ""large"" client/friend (I didn't get his name) nearly stole the movie in every scene he was in! It's worth renting just to watch him!

"As usual, another great performance by Smith!","Will Smith has outdone himself in this refreshing portrayal as an ubercool 'love doctor' who fails to take his own advice when trying to woo the sexy Eva Mendes. I recommend this film highly, not just for the unmistakably funny and outstanding performance by Will Smith but also for the input of the sexy and sultry Eva Mendes. This is a rom-com but unlike other movies of this genre it doesn't come across as pretentious because it never tries to be anything other than this, instead it builds upon it's strengths which include Smith's ability to create humour out of nothing but also his ability to get the best out of his co-stars such as Eva Mendes. As well as the tremendously funny scenes with Smith and Kevin James, there is also unbelievable chemistry between Mendes and Smith which makes this film a way above average romantic comedy.

Best romantic comedy for years,"Well, if you watch a movie, what do you expect? What do you want? What makes a good movie a good movie? Well, I tell some of my thoughts about it: It like stories that make you laugh and smile and eat popcorn, but in addition give you the chance to think and philosophy if you like to do so. Story plots with several layers for different moods and different people. I am into good actors, well actually everybody is and everybody might have a different opinion about who is a good actor and what makes a good actor. For me Will Smith is one of the best. And if you still think the Fresh Prince will ever stay the Frech Prince, this movie should change your view! And another chance for a change of viewpoint is, when the IPS driver Kevin James mutates to the clumsy tax adviser in love.Well, Hitch is the Healing for everybody out there who thought a romantic comedy is infested with Bridget Jones or H. Grant by force. It's the fresh and joyful proof that a romantic comedy can can be a very good movie indeed. Actually it's Hollywood.

Will Smith is one of my favorite actors anything with him in i watch! Hitch is one of his best characters for me he's just so charming and cute and i love his ears!(a strange fetish of mine!!) I love the way he works with Albert who is so funny in this film too!!. I love a happy ending in a film and this film delivers that with ease the dance at the wedding cracks me up every time as does the practise dancing before Alberts 1st date with Allegra!!. All in all this is a great film!!.,8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wonderful Chick Flick,"A chick flick that Guys still like - Yes! Wonderful. Now I can have fun, enjoy the company of my girl, and not feel like I can't wait until the movie ends! Light - but funny. Great stuff. What ever you do don't miss the DVD extras. This a great ""blind date"" file too. Will Smith does well in this - even though in is light acting - he pulls trough it all well. The movie is a little slow in pacing - don't expect too much action - the laughs are there - and so is the message - but the timing is a little slow. Use the low moments to whisper or kiss - it will pick up. The ending makes the feel good moments worth it. Most of all expect fun light hearted fare - and watch for some great upstaging by the supporting actors - they make the film. The plot twists are predictable - but it IS a date move, so get the refills of popcorn from the kitchen - and don't make her pause it. Count on more dates after this movie - she'll want o see what is next in line. Remember Hitch's advice!!!Enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"As a young guy I thought chivalry was dead. ""Nice guys finish last"" But this movie proves otherwise.","Will Smith is a excellent character as a relationship advisory. As a guy you have such pressure on your shoulder to make the first move whatever the circumstance. of relationship and is very cheesy, I know it's suppose to be rough at times, but this gives direction for the beginning of a relationship which for a guy who's wants to start dating is always great.Will helps Albert become confident and relaxed around the women of his dreams and end up marrying her. It shows that you just need to give it a chance, whats the worst that can happen.Will also goes through his relationship showing pointers on have to be a gentlemen.Overall very funny, great advice and pleasure to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hilarious,"Personally when me an my mate were in town an he suggested we watched Hitch i laughed at him. But it was the only option available, because of time constraints. This film came as a huge surprise to me, its hilarious, will smith is a legend, and Eva Mendes is stunning throughout. The Film is a great Comedy and just as funny as the Prince of Bell Air. The narrative in some points quite predictable, which is understandable, but the characters presence bring the plot alive with humour.It may seem sad but i was in tears of laughter throughout, which was unexpected and totally worth the ticket price. I'd suggest this film to all audiences.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Better than i thought it would be. Eva Mendes -- wow!,"I have to admit that I liked this film much more than I expected to. Will Smith has that clean-cut charm that you just can't help but like. The plot was a minor twist on basic romantic comedy stuff, somewhat reminiscent of Jane Austen's ""Emma"". This guy Kevin James has a real flair for comic timing and physical comedy. I have never seen his TV show, but he was cast very well in this film. Amber Valletta was good enough. I can't remember why she was a rich celebrity in this film, but if she was supposed to be an actress or model, then the casting might have left something to be desired. I enjoyed Julie Ann Emery, and wish she'd had a larger part. But, saving the best for last, Eva Mendes more or less stole the show. Her beauty, and charm, and just the right amount of standoffishness had me glued to the screen whenever she was there. I hope to see more of her in the future. This film is definitely worth checking out.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
I cannot believe I am doing this!!!,"Okay, let me say it right off the bat, 'I do not like romantic comedies!!'. But, once in a while (actually only once before) a RC comes along that breaks the barriers of my manhood; Jerry McGuire being the other. Let me break it down for you.My wife drug me to this movie kicking and screaming all the way, just knowing it would be the typical: Guy meets girl-guy loses girl-guy gets girl back, type of movie. Don't get me wrong this movie does fit this profile, but with much greater depth. The acting is GREAT; I think I will now allow Will Smith back in my 'Circle of Trust' (he was soundly booted after his performance in 'I, Robot'). The story is somewhat unique, but the addition of Kevin James made all the difference. I have been in these situations before and couldn't wait to get out of the seat and back home to watch ESPN, but there is something special about this film.I gave this movie a 9, only because my male pride will not allow me to give a Romantic Comedy any higher of a rating.

boy meets girl,"Hitch is a light-hearted comedy that will entertain you with some fine performances. Will Smith turns in a believable performance as a cloak and dagger Date Doctor who must remain invisible to protect his clients and his profession. Smith was excellent, never schmaltzing it up too much.The best piece of acting goes to the actor (don't know name) playing this accountant who has fallen for this woman who is out of his league. This actor did an excellent job of character development as he listens to Smith's directions, but in the end, just can't help being who he really is.And in the end, that's the main message of this film. Be who you are in love, and you'll be OK.At the same time, Will Smith meets this attractive lady and the Date Doctor gets a taste of his own medicine as he slowly falls for this woman. Don't know her name, but she was pretty good too.Overall, this was a delightful, light movie that is definitely worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love for the Date Doctor,"""No guile, no game... No girl"". Alex ""Hitch"" Hitchens (Will Smith) is the Love Guru. He can get any guy a real chance with the girl of their dreams. Hitch works in secret for he wants the guys to seem genuine in their courtship of their women. The film is a romantic comedy that flows very well from beginning to end. The theme of the story is very predictable, but with the way it's presented, it works. Hitch appears to be the guy with all the moves to get the ladies. He's faced with his biggest challenge as a Love Guru when Albert (Kevin James), a chubby accountant, is in love with Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta), a rich heiress. Once Hitch gets plans in motion to help Albert gain the attention of Allegra, he finds a love interest of his own, Sara (Eva Mendes). Sara is a columnist for a gossip newspaper. These story lines essentially carry on to the end of the movie. This movie had a star-studded cast in my opinion. Will Smith was excellent with keeping it light and being funny, but also being serious or romantic when the moment called for it. Kevin James was absolutely amazing. He did a great job of being the awkward guy; he really did it at the perfect level. And I think everyone has to appreciate the inhaler scene. Eva Mendes does a good job of being the closed girl who shows no interest in ever having a significant other. Lastly, Amber Valletta does a good job of revealing her character slowly throughout the movie. At first, many would think there is no shot Allegra and Albert could end up together, but as the movie goes on the viewer realizes how similar they really are. All of their little quirks line up perfectly with each other. Director Andy Tennant may have tried to squeeze too much into this movie. It seems like he tried to squeeze too many story lines into one movie. First you have Allegra/Albert, and then it's Hitch/Sara, which leads to Sara's job as a celebrity columnist, and finally a sleezeball who hooked up with Sara's best friend. With so many subplots going on, it was hard to wrap up all of them fully, and Tennant obviously struggled with this. Kevin Bisch scripted the movie extremely well. Balancing plenty of witty remarks and sappy, romantic quotes used by Hitch. A prime example being, ""Life is not the amount of breaths you take, it's the moments that take your breath away"". Some certainly will get sick of the deep, profound quotes that seem so obviously scripted, but others will appreciate how they play into the movie. The movie is a classic romantic comedy, but it also has enough of it's own individuality to set it apart from other average movies of the genre. Hitch was a typical romantic comedy movie, but it brought just enough extra material to make it a step above the romantic comedies we've become used to. I'm sure there are some who don't appreciate how fun the movie is, and see it just as another run of the mill movie. I really liked the movie and didn't see it as a typical 'chick flick', and believe this is a movie for all, not just couples or women.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Had a bad day?  Rent Hitch and laugh your way out of it!,"Somebody nominate Kevin James for an Oscar for this one. His performance is endearing, hysterical, and truly astounding. He takes on emotional scenes with the skill of Olivier, and physical comedy that makes Chevy Chase and Dick Van Dyke look like amateurs. (And just wait til you see his dance moves!)The movie is light-hearted, humorous, and endearing.

"At first, I didn't want to see the movie, but after seeing it, was glad I did.","First, I stopped thinking of Will Smith as a comedic actor because of his action movies (okay, some of his action movies has comedy in it). Then I remembered his Fresh Prince of Bel Air sitcom days. Smith is very believable as Alex Hitchins even though I've never heard of someone making big bucks as a ""date consultant.""Second, the movie was hilarious. I was laughing out loud and would have even if I was alone it the theater. And I'm not a comedy movie fan either.Hitch is worth checking out whether you're single, together or married.

Funny,"This was a romantic, simple funny movie. I really enjoyed it and would definitely say to watch it and enjoy it, Will Smith was funny, fumbly, nervous, sweet and just a simple guy who got hit by Love. It was cute to see him fall for someone and be so nervous and lost as to what to do or say. It was great. He was great, funny as usual. Eva Mendes was better than i expected her to be as well, i thought there were moments in the movie where Will got the shaft, he was doing everything he could being a good guy and still getting treated bad. The ending was romantic and happy and it was great. I have seen it several times, and would watch it again. A funny, movie, something you don't see a lot of anymore. It had the old time feel with a fresh new look.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very Well Done,"I went into this movie not expecting what i was about to receive. Usually Will Smith stars in average to good films but this one blew me away. He did not play a cop, agent or some action hero trying to save a pretty girl from the cltuches of evil. The entire cast fits their roles perfectly. Hitch has some of the best casting I have seen in a while, which is something to be said for the lack of big names. The New York City backdrop and real life clumsiness in the dating world is nicely portrayed. Their are some fairytale moments, however this can be expected seeing as how it is a big production. The role is a nice change for smith and can serve as a confidence booster to those in the dating world, although they should not use some of the fancy dialog used in the film. Not only is the role very well suited for Smith, but it is something he plays to the finest detail. The story is truly original, which is becoming a larger factor in the quality of the movie industry today.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
I was richly entertained!!,"I think that the basic idea of any movie is to entertain or to inform. If you want information you are looking at true life movies and historical movies. Sometimes these are one of the same. The other side of the coin is to entertain. Did Hitch entertain me? Yes it did. Okay the formula is standard. Boy meets girl or in this case boys met girls. They get together have a falling out then get back together. However the way it happened in this movie was refreshing. I particularly liked the bar scene with Hitch and Sara. The Allegra Albert romance was a delight to watch unfold, most REAL men are shy when it comes to wooing the woman of their dreams and had I had Hitch's advice I would probably have got my wife up the altar in half the time.I read the first comment on this film that appeared to suggest that this movie was played safely and good have had a few more laughs. I tend to disagree there are so many laughs you can pack into a romantic comedy without turning it into a farce. Besides relationships have there serious moments. All in all I found Hitch quite entertaining, the actors did a good job (I will be looking out for them in other movies) and Hitch is a film that I am very happy to have in my DVD collection.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Better than I expected!,"Judging by the preview for this movie, I assumed it would follow the same pattern of every make-over movie out there. I was pretty surprised to see it only held that pattern very loosely throughout.It wasn't like a teen movie where the makeover instructor discovers they've been wrong all along right at the end... this movie is really about the instructor and how he can talk the talk, but he can't walk the walk.It made me laugh pretty hard a lot of times. I didn't expect it to be funny beyond what the preview gave up. It also had a few touching moments.. and then crafty ways of coming out of them right back into comedy. (like an episode of Friends) I was also impressed by the length of the movie. Fast-paced from beginning to end, and never lets up once. Most movies can't do this in less than 90 minutes... but Hitch keeps it going all the way.Thank you to the makers of this film for coming out with something purely entertaining, and not more repeated crap. Good job avoiding the norm. (whats original these days, anyway?)",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Will Smith has found his element...,"I know this won't get me a lot of ""helpful"" votes, but I have to say it. I am not a big Will Smith fan. I don't like Science Fiction. Hated ""Prince of Bel Aire."" Thought Men in Black was slack! But I LOVE THIS MOVIE! It really is fantastic! I have to say first of all, major kudos to the Music arranger and music writers. I really loved the soundtrack selection, as well as the original sound recordings for this movie. From the first hit song, playing during the opening arrangement, Hitche's intro, to the final notes, every song is dead on, and perfect. Michael Rappaport. Can somebody explain to me why this guy isn't a bigger star getting bigger roles? Is he somebody's buddy? He plays every part he's in perfectly, and I wish we could see more of him. He's in one short bar scene playing pool with Will Smith's character, as we get to know who Hitch really is. I also like Eva Mendes, and the other smaller roles throughout. And of couse, Kevin James steals every scene he is in. He really is a great physical comedian. Every scene he is in made me scream with laugher. I'm exaggerating a bit, but you know what I mean. I originally watched this on the UMD on my PSP, but I also rented it on DVD, and enjoyed the extras very much. Commentary is great, and enjoyable. I liked learning about the decisions about soundtrack, especially since I enjoyed it so much. Great twin story lines between Hitch and the Kevin James character.

It pains me to say this...,"As I've said in the title of this review, It pains me to say this, but ""hitch"" reaches the zenith of what Hollywood Romantic Comedies can ever hope to aspire to. I've been a critic of both the Genre and it's namesake for as long as I can remember myself, but on an almost tragic note, ""Hitch"" has caused me to spend somewhere in the neighborhood of two hours of my life with a ridiculous smile plastered across my face.This movie may be misogynistic and presumptuous at times but it nonetheless possesses a certain humor about it whose subtlety may only be described as British. This is a wonderful attempt by Hollywood to make (Or remake as the case may be...) a film which appeals to all of our wishes for a Romantic Comedy which can make us both think and laugh simultaneously. I grudgingly and most evasively give this movie a 9 out of 10... Something you shall hardly see me do for a Romantic Comedy in the near future, or so at least, I hope.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

And Kevin James gets some serious mileage on his supporting role in this comedy.My wife said that what she liked even more than the movie was watching me laugh so hard. Come on, if you don't die laughing at the Benadryl scene then you must not have a pulse! This movie could have very easily gone raunchy (Date Dr helps men pick up women for sex), but instead it takes a moral high ground with Hitch rejecting one jerk who only wants to ""bag"" a broad. Hitch just helps his loser clients get beautiful women to give them a chance (so he thinks).He has everything it takes to be the next James Bond if he wants to do it.This is a firm 9+ out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Nothing is ever impossible,"He might be the most insightful dating coach to ever exist, but Will Smith might of forgot about himself as he was so good at his job coaching others. Smith shows throughout the film Hitch produced by Andy Tennant, that no one is ever out of a person's league. Smith's determination to help his clients succeed is his whole life and these men depend on him to make every right move in the hope of capturing their dream girl who is way out of their league. Along with Smith's role in Hitch he also stars in the movie ""The Pursuit of Happiness"". Smith's role in The Pursuit of Happiness is a father figure that his son idols and looks up to the most.
In the romantic comedy Hitch, Will Smith plays the lifesaving role of a dating coach named Hitch that many men depend on for the relationship advice they are going to use to capture their dream girls even if they might be uncomprehending out of their league. Hitch is a unique kind of dating coach, he only takes clients from referrals from past clients that have found success. He keeps his job very quiet and secretive so he can be the best dating coach possible and only takes people who are genuinely willing to put in the effort to find true love. While Hitches clients look up to him as the most important person in their life Hitch himself is easy to forget about his own love life.
The uplifting punchline of ""Hitch"" is that anything is possible if you are your own true self and put in the special effort that will blow that person away because that's what the person really wants to know is who you actually are, not the person you are pretending to be because what's the point of pretending to be someone else if that's not who you really are? Hitch is an amazing coach to others what is his relationship life like? Does he have a love of his own? Or is his job more important than taking the time for himself to do what he does best for others?
With Hitch being the master of dating and everything that falls into that category does he know firsthand himself how to talk to the lady of his dreams? In the film Hitch realizes that he too should go for the girl of his dreams, Sara Melas. Being the intelligent man he is, he gains little background information on Sara from the bartender at the club where he first saw Sara. He asked what kind of drink she was having so he could start a conversation with her on the right note. As he was in route to make a move with Sara the women he had been looking for his whole life another man had already taken his spot and he thinks quick to get this other guy away from her. He approached Sara along with this other man that was hitting on her and Hitch took the approach of pretending to already know her so the other man would leave them alone. Hitch worked his magic and lured Sara in for the long run.
While Hitch was a very exceptional film, I wish that smith was able to focus more on himself and his dreams rather than working on making the dreams of others come true but in the end he makes the best of both worlds.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Pleasant Surprise!,"For whatever odd reason, I never thought Hitch would be a good movie but as usual, I was proved wrong. This is a sweet romantic comedy that is led by the star power of Will Smith.

But his secret methods become known to the public after the investigation of a tabloid journalist.The acting is very good and charming. Will Smith is a bankable star, but he also knows how to act. His persona is exactly perfect for this film. Kevin James is really funny and he adds more to his clumsy fat guy role. Eva Mendes is okay but she seems a bit like a jerk.Overall, this is a good romantic comedy that's perfect for date night. I was hooked into the story and I was kind of sad when this film ended.

Keep your expectations in check and you will be somewhat surprised.,"An enjoyable watch indeed, Hitch combines the Hollywood glamour of Will Smith and Eva Mendes against the comparatively lesser-known acting talent of Kevin James and Amber Valletta to amusing effect.Granted, the film does maintain an air of predictability throughout however one hardly sits through 118 minutes of what is essentially a romantic comedy without expecting a heart warming and happy ending (at least in theory!)I particularly enjoyed the 'sophisticated' flirting that takes place between the two protagonists especially when they first meet in that upmarket bar and of course, the ever bumbling yet virtuous persona that is Albert Brennaman.In conclusion, an 'easy' watch that, if approached with a suitable mindset (i.e. do not expect to have your mind blown!), may well turn out to be a two hours well spent.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

This movie had two such scenes -- the don't dance lesson (seen in all the trailers but better in its entirety) and the food allergy scene. But the entire movie had its charm from beginning to end. For me there was an added benefit in the underlying message of the movie. Men are jerks, but we are lovable because of it. None of us really know what can attract a woman. The harder we try, the more we fail -- unless of course, we are just sleazy (those guys seem to succeed at getting what they want all the time, although there is no joy in that kind of relationship for most people).

Kevin James is also very funny in his first movie role. We enjoyed it, you will enjoy it. It is plain and simple a fun night out for the entire family. That's right you can even take the kids. No sex, no cursing, just plain ole fun. Kudos to Will Smith who is a very talented young man and stats say he is the most bankable Hollywood star as to the money aspect.

Sprezzatura!!!,"The Italian concept of ""sprezzatura"" was the grace and nonchalance in social manners that led to success in love, as described in the 16th century manual ""The Courtier."" The film ""Hitch"" is worth watching for the embodiment of the ""sprezzzatura"" concept in the dynamic performance of Will Smith.Smith plays the character of Alex ""Hitch"" Hitchens, who is a professional dating consultant to those short on luck and confidence. The best scenes are when Hitch coaches the painfully shy and maladroit Albert in his quest to win the heart of a New York socialite and in Hitch's own attraction to Sara and a surprise for her when visiting Ellis Island. In these scenes, Smith is supported with good work from Kevin James and Eva Mendes. But this film is driven by the charm and winsome personality of Smith.From start to finish, Smith rises above the average comic script to make ""Hitch"" an eminently watchable and entertaining film. I do not believe there is another actor working today who is capable of delivering the charisma and the perfect timing with the comic moments like Will Smith in this film. And his secret is in the ""sprezzatura""!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Thoroughly enjoyable,"As romantic comedies go, Hitch is as fun as it gets. Will Smith seems incapable of NOT being entertaining, no matter what he is doing. Some critics have panned this film for being predictable and/or clichéd, but why does one go to see a romantic comedy? To have one's mind blown, or to have a laugh at the awkwardness of humans in romantic situations? Hitch may not be exactly groundbreaking, but neither is it boring. Smith is a comic genius--I can't remember seeing an actor so at ease in front of the camera, so ready so mock himself, or so spontaneous in every situation. Eva Mendes is the perfect foil to Smith's overpowering personality--she holds up her end of the duo with pizazz. Chalk Hitch up with The Wedding Singer on the list of recent must-see romantic comedies.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Absolutely love this,"This movie is not a comedy designed to make you laugh out loud, but rather one that makes you giggle and relate to the characters. I feel like the chemistry between James and Will Smith works perfectly, and I personally prefer Will in these kinds of movies rather than action films. Hitch really sticks with you and leaves a lasting impression after watching it, which is why I rated it a solid 8-the whole thing just works for me.I would have liked to see more of the character's dating coach persona, as I feel it isn't explored sufficiently. However, the story as it is still feels satisfying. Great watch I highly reccomend this.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
If you like romantic comedy -- it doesn't get any better,"If you like romantic comedy -- and there are plenty of us -- it doesn't get any better than this. In spite of the cynics and the critics, many of us still love your basic Hollywood romance. Well this is it, great story, very likable characters, fabulous ending.Will Smith, Eva Mendes, and Kevin James were all great and suited their role perfectly. Will Smith makes a perfect romantic lead, as far as I'm concerned, and he's very funny. Eva Mendes has wonderful attitude although she's perhaps a bit short on the soft side. And Kevin James steals the show -- he's hysterical.I loved his Baryshnikov moment -- I thought it took great courage on the part of the director and it was an amazing moment.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hitch — A solid modern slick romantic comedy,"Hitch is a slick romantic movie with two slick main characters. They are hot, beautiful, perfect, and the best at what they do. The only problem? They both have baggage that keeps them from love. Nothing new there.The whole movie is extremely slick. The music, the camera shots, the editing, the script... it's grandiose, and beautiful. It's most interesting feature, though, is the endearing nature of the secondary characters, and the business they're involved in.It makes for a very interesting story, something you want to be part of.The only real hiccup, is the way that she repeatedly snubs him at the end. Had I been in his shoes, she would have had a piece of my mind for being manipulated that way. However, it does fit in the movie, and I'll just lump it with all the Hollywood over exaggeration I'm always whining about.You want to see a good romantic comedy that anyone, even a man, can enjoy? That's it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Perfect Example of its Genre,"Hitch is a romantic comedy. Of all movie genres romantic comedies are the most formula bound. Just as we know Perry Mason will win the case and Jason will kill a bunch of teenagers, we know that the handsome man will get the beautiful girl after around ninety minutes of painfully contrived obstacles. Why? Because that is what the audience wants. We don't go to these movies looking for innovation. We want the boy to get the girl and woe betides the director who messes with us in the name of Art. The danger of formula is it encourages sloppy productions. Cast some pretty leads, lay the jokes in with a trowel and stack the corn at the end and your golden, right? The nation's cinemas are littered with the wreckage of this sort of thinking. What the smart producer knows is while audiences may want the familiar ride they are also looking for a good story well told. The makers of Hitch were very smart. The movie conforms in every way to formula but distinguishes itself from the pack by its writing, some genuinely funny gags and its amiable tone.Will Smith plays Hitch, a modern matchmaker dedicated to helping the average Joe land the girl of his dreams. His clients must be sincerely in love and he insists on working in secrecy, being more of a Cyrano de Bergerac than a Dolly Levi. His advice is sound and he genuinely cares for the schlubs that form his clientele. His current case involves a chubby, disaster prone accountant crazy for a beautiful heiress. As Hitch sets to work he meets an improbably sweet gossip columnist and finds himself falling in love. Of course Hitch is deathly afraid of commitment and the gossip is stubbornly cynical about romance in general. All of this folderol is as insubstantial as it sounds. Hitch does not incline the viewer to trot out weighty French critical terminology.Romantic comedies rise and fall on the charm of their leads. Those fluffy Rock Hudson/Doris Day comedies of the '60s would not be so fondly remembered if they starred, say, John Cassavetes and Gena Rowlands. Will Smith and Eva Mendes have charm to spare. Importantly Smith as Hitch doesn't come across as insincere. He's a nice articulate guy who genuinely likes the opposite sex and does his best by them. Mendes matches Smith's intelligence and gives Hitch reasons beyond her beauty for his growing infatuation. The supporting cast is no less involving. Kevin James is a hopeless, clumsy mess as the lovelorn accountant and his struggle to implement Hitch's smooth moves are as hilarious as they are endearing. Julie Ann Emery as Mendes' eternally hopeful best friend and Adam Arkin as Mendes' level headed boss are excellent. The only possible quibble is Amber Valletta as the heiress lacks the oomph in either looks or personality to so captivate the poor accountant.Hitch is a determinedly sunny movie. With the exception of one loathsome yuppie all the characters are decent and likable, even those who work for the NY Post style tabloid. Manhattan is a beautiful and happy place where everyone is at least moderately well to do and there is no racial or ethnic tension. It's a world where love carries the stacked deck and Cupid is all mighty. Yes, this is a fantasy as broad as anything you'd see Gollum in, but man does not live by angst alone. Sometimes charm and laughs are important and Hitch fills the bill brilliantly.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

One of my favorite romantic comedies,"""Hitch"" is a unique romantic comedy that I found completely enjoyable. It was one of the rare ones that is equally funny and romantic, and it wasn't overly predictable. A good feel-good movie like this puts the main characters in situations many of us would love to find ourselves in, such as Kevin James' (who you may recognize from the recent ""Paul Blart: Mall Cop"") scene with the girl he loves in the meeting room. The plot revolves around Will Smith as ""Hitch,"" the ""date doctor"" who tries to place other guys in situations where they will find it easier to get a date with a girl they are in love with. However, as his own romance with Eva Mendes takes off, he finds love to be a difficult thing for him personally. What I loved about this film was that there are really two different love stories the film is following, yet we are inclined to care equally about both of them. Smith and Mendes have good chemistry, and the supporting cast works very well too. Kevin James is an easily likable character that many of us are can relate to and easily feel for. I could have done without a few sequences, such as Will Smith's allergy to fish and some of the stories of his previous romances at the beginning, but the movie doesn't give me too much room to complain. Entertaining and romantic, and this film combines those two very well.***1/2 out of ****",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A decent romantic comedy, a must-see for Will Smith fans","Andy Tennant's ""hitch"" is possibly his best effort so far (better than fools rush in... ). Will Smitch stars as Hitch, a ""date doctor"", a man helping other men who need help winning the ladies. Eva Mendes is a reporter he befriends who works for a tabloid paper. Will Smith was decent in the lead role, not his best performance, but better than average. Eva mendes was not so great, i did not feel much chemistry between her and Smith, plus her scenes seemed a bit over the top at times and not realistic. Kevin James, however, was hilarious, best part about the film. Amber Valletta and Adam Arkin were also really good, as was Rapaport in his only scene (waste of a good talent). The screenplay was decent, not as funny as it should have been, but not bad. All in all, this was entertaining and a bit better than the average romantic comedies these days, but still. The direction kept it interesting and it was never boring although never brilliant. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Will Smith always so darn funny!,"I liked this comedy so much. Will Smith does not do anything slow. It is always right on target with the greatest scripts and comedy that keeps you laughing, and involved in the plot. You are watching a skilled comedian, who plays all his parts well. One fully believes he is who he is playing. I loved him and Tommy Lee Jones in the Men in Black. This comedy rates right up with that movie. The humor is fast moving, and Will Smith is as sure of himself as he was in Men in Black. Quick witted, and well skilled in the art of making others score each time, but doing it in a tasteful manner, and with finesse.Will Smith seems to have honed his comedy routine well. He was so darn funny. I loved the part where he had an allergic reaction to something he ate, and his face swelled up, and he looked more like Cassius Clay after a fight then he did himself. Then seeing him sipping on the benadryl bottle trying to bring his head back down to the right size. I laughed so hard. He knows how to make us all laugh.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

great date movie!,"Will Smith has disappointed me in the past (read: I, Robot; Men in Black 2). However, I think he was perfect for the role of Alex Hitchens. He's suave, yet clumsy.

My boyfriend and I went to see it after my friend told me it was a perfect date movie. We both loved it. It wasn't one of those cry-my-eyes-out movies (ie The Notebook), but much more suited for a fun date. I would definitely recommend this movie to my friends, regardless if they are dating or not.

a smart and funny look at meetings between guys and girls,"Will Smith (Independence Day) stars as Hitch, a date doctor who helps guys create opportunities to gain courage with women. When Sara and Albert come along, his principles are tested to the extreme.With an excellent first hour, with slick comedy and likable characters, Hitch tails off into the cliché side of relationships towards the end but still generates a feel good motive to make an enjoyable funny romantic comedy.The lovable Will Smith is again so likable in his own unique way as the sophisticated date doctor, smart and easily the funniest gut throughout, though Kevin James (The King of Queens) is just as funny, none more so than the dancing sequences and his general clumsiness.The whole cast is great, and form good on screen chemistry, and do their best with some clumsy dialogue. The last half an hour or so made me feel sicker than Hitch in the fish scene, a complete dramatic insanity with the whole small world and misunderstandings and coincidental meetings used, which is a shame as it had the potential to be a full length slick and sophisticated romantic comedy but was ruined by the everyday use of clichés.The first hour is excellent though, with a sharp and precise look at the meeting between the sexes, a true look at how guys and girls hit it off, or find it difficult to talk to each other. Packed with humour but an accurate ideology gets the film started in the right way, exciting and realistic and also very funny. The whole concept of the film will make you smile and chuckle along and you will feel slightly let down come the end.The film is a rare type of successful romantic comedies by having physical and scripted humour which are genuinely funny, which is very rare in modern films which overuse one or the other.Hitch is a smart natured romantic comedy with a good look at the interaction between guys and girls with a good natured approach, containing a good use of humour which is let down by cheesy dialogue and scenarios in the last half an hour.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A very likable movie.,"Will smith is definitely improving as an actor. I thoroughly enjoyed I,Robot, where i thought he was excellent, and Will Smith hits one out of the park with Hitch.Unlike Shark Tale, where Smith laid on the humour thick and liberally, the humour was more controlled and not so Smith-centric (adding Kevin James to the casting helped here). I guess some of the credit has to go to the writers on that score.Smith excelled in the rom-com genre film Hitch (also his nickname in the film) as the silky smooth love doctor who seems to have all the right lines. Even Mendes (I say ""even"" as though she is stunningly gorgeous, I'm not a fan of Eva's) was good as the smart gossip columnist Sara. The side plot, starring James (Albert) and Amber Valletta (Allegra) was as amusing and thoroughly complimentary.Teaming Smith with Monyahan in I, Robot worked well for me. Smith and Mendes were just as good here too. My only criticism of the film (which I would recommend to watch or buy on DVD- I don't work for the film, honest!) is the lack of the cold-hearted ending. I will say no more about the ending, but what i will say is, though there are slight twists, i could have guessed it would have ended something like that. But I loved it, and it works for the ladies or the fellas. Like to see if Smith can nail another big hit.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Average Date Flick,"Hitch is a romantic comedy starring charismatic Will Smith. He plays Hitch, a dating counselor who coaches men in the art of getting a woman. Unfortunately, Smith is without any love in his life. Enter Eva Mendes and what an entrance. She is probably one of the only reasons to see this film. She's an absolute knockout. From that point on the story is the standard boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl plot.Will Smith has enough screen presence to make his rather weak part seem better than it really is.Kevin James seems lost and out of place in the film and seems to be more of a actor who should remain on TV. He just doesn't quite translate to the big screen.Hitch is an enjoyable but lightweight film. The background music is terrible though.",,Anonymous,Romance
Hitch is the formula romantic comedies should use,"The great thing about Hitch is that it is not your standard, run of the mill romantic comedy; it actually has some substance and thought. Will Smith is an extremely handsome man and Kevin James is not bad looking either, however, admittedly, he isn't the archetype of something that all women lust over, he's a regular guy, overweight, goofy, and doesn't know what to do. Romantic comedies have knack for making guys only looking to get into women's pants and women being the helpless 'victims;' Hitch turned that idea on it's ear and made the men 'helpless' and the women more of the strong, unapproachable beings which is a great switch for guys who feel like they just don't have what it takes to be the man that all the women want or even just one woman wants; they feel like losers. Hitch is a romantic comedy for nice guys who are having difficulty in romance; I'm not saying it's a 'How to Guide' but it's certainly the only film I've seen that empathizes with the man's struggle in the world of relationships and that's what makes it so wonderful and unique. I'm surprised Hitch has such little fanfare or appreciation, to me it seems completely revolutionary but perhaps that is the problem; people weren't ready to see this they still wanted to see women fawning over muscular, chiseled men and men being sexual jerks who only want sex. Hitch is the movie I look to in my own film work as I try to expose the struggle of the 'nice guy' who just doesn't know what to do.",,Anonymous,Romance
Hitch the movie,I saw this movie yesterday Sunday 6th march 2005 and was disappointed i thought it would have been more funny as it had Will smith and he is a wonderful actor but at times the film was silly and more should have been done and said.Will smith can be very hilarious but in this movie it seemed as though he should have not been in the film . Most times you would see will smith being very cool and slick but it needed some sort of push. I would say it was OK but it would not be in my DVD collection.it is more of a over long romantic comedy and some of the scenes that were funny should have been for longer as they seemed to short which was a shame .

"Same concept we have seen before,but here is the comical timing of Will Smith that makes the film standout","Who says that this was Will Smith's first foray into comedy? You are gladly mistaken. ""Hitch"" is not the first time that Will Smith has done a comical role,but lets say that his first was in a 1989 movie in which he starred opposite Ted Danson and Whoopi Goldberg and a teenage looking Nia Long,but I forgot what the title of that movie is,but I get back to that later. However,he is known for his comical hijinks and hilarious antics on both movies and television,and for those who forgot his stint on television for his classic series from the 1990's ""The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air"",which ran for six years on NBC-TV,is a must see for those who wondered where Will Smith homed in onto his craft,and this was way before he came ""Mister Hollywood"",and to put it bluntly,""Major Hollywood Box office Star"". But these days he still holds the title of such a accomplish feat,and still puts out a very good hip-hop album every once in a while. But his newest venture is just that:nothing but an amusing mixed bag of hijinks that Will Smith always has been doing with a element of every romantic storyline that everyone has seen before,and so forth. Smith's character is just like any character we have seen before in romantic comedies,where the main character charms the chicks,but helps out a hopeless character,who couldn't score with the women get his play on,but in the long run his A-Game is out and he needs to get back into the swing of things before his loses his ""mackness"",and so on. Here,Will Smith plays a ""date doctor"",who helps out an accountant(played by Kevin James of the TV-series King Of Queens)into shape so that he can get the woman of his dreams,in this case a millionaire heirless(Amber Valletta).Our character falls for a gossip columnist(Eva Mendes)where he not only loses his chemistry but his game into getting the ladies. Actually we have heard this story before,but in some aspects it is two distinct movies in one,but for the most part of it is very funny in some aspects especially within some of the scenes and not to mention the romantic chemistry that sparkles between Will Smith and Eva Mendes is very charming indeed,but the main part of the film is nothing but Will Smith at his comical best. But as far as the story is concern,since Smith is not only the star,but is also the co-writer and executive producer. But the real problem is the script,where the first half is excellent,but comes apart where it grinds to a halt during the film's tedious second and final acts of the movie. But for those huge fans that love Will Smith,this will be a change for his usual work and to me it is not bad at what everyone else thinks of this film. For the most part,just see this for the love of ""Big Willie"".",,Anonymous,Romance

As a African American woman, I would like to see more movies with African American couples but I know that the movie industry doesn't see any money in showing African American couples in a romantic comedy or serious drama.

"""Hitch"" is a funny movie driven by its well-defined, empathetic characters.","Will Smith only has one character that he plays in every movie. You know him. The cool guy who always has a comeback, even in dangerous situations. The guy that can be wrong or act stupid and somehow you still want to be like him. The lead role in this movie was written for that character and the result is a physically and emotionally funny movie.The plot of the movie did not take a genius to conjure it out of thin air; everyone knows about date doctors. In that same vein, the movie is predictable in many ways, the most prominent being foreshadowing through the characters' past experiences. But the secret of this movie, of all successful comedies, nay movies, nay fiction in general; are round characters.In case it's been awhile since high school English, let me define a round character: it is a well-defined character that changes from the story's beginning to its end. This character has problems and opinions and anecdotes like real people. Because of these features, we can identify with him/her and cheer them on in their quest for whatever.Every main character in ""Hitch"" fits this description. They also all manage to be funny in their own ways- Kevin James is the ""born loser"" who practices great physical comedy and could not dance to save his life, Eva Mendes is the vivacious gossip columnist with all the right answers to all of Hitch's classic lines, and I bet you can guess what kind of humor Will Smith practices through his character.All of these different types of humor play off of each other well, merging into a movie where the audience will find themselves exchanging glances with their neighbors, nodding their heads in agreement with the dialogue, and laughing out loud on a number of occasions.This movie narrowly escaped the pitfalls that usually coax comedies into the upsettingly abundant world of drivel. Luckily for us, ""Hitch"" avoids sexually explicit scenes or suggestive dialogue for the most part, which allows us to stay focused on the more important aspects of comedy at the beginning and the resolution of the plot at the end.In short, ""Hitch"" is a movie that is worth your time and money. It is perfect for a Friday night date.",,Anonymous,Romance

Will Smith should do more romantic comedies!,"'Hitch' is a romantic comedy based around the life of a 'love doctor' called Alex 'Hitch' Hitchens and his clients; many different men who all suffer from the same problem, of being unable to capture the hearts of their chosen lady. Hitch, played by Will Smith, is a charismatic character and was perfectly cast for the role. He uses lessons learnt in his own private life in order to help his customers achieve their desired goal  basically educating men in what women really want and how to go about fulfilling those needs, while opening their eyes up to the many ways in which they could mess things up. I can imagine that Will Smith has portrayed the character in such a way that he is admired and respected by men, adored and chased by women. Although you cannot help but cringe where things go disastrously wrong concerning his own love life with Sara, a gossip columnist he falls for while out in a bar one night. In particular, his second date with her when he suffers an allergic reaction was one of horror and I felt so sorry for both parties at the time, although it was as a result of this freak accident that the barrier between them was finally taken down and they admitted their feelings towards each other.It must be difficult to make a good romantic comedy without cheesiness, as there are many soppy movies around but very few that pull off the classic story of girl meets guy and after a struggle they end up together. However, Hitch masters the basic theme wonderfully. It inspired genuine reactions from me, and I found myself squirming in my seat at times, curious about how the characters would react, laughing out loud at original comic scenes, and finally leaving the cinema with a warm feeling inside me. I think that is the key to a good rom-com  being able to entertain people while providing them with a believable romantic tale, so that they go away either feeling grateful for their own relationships, or if single are left optimistic with the belief that no matter how bad things may seem to be in the past or present there is always a chance that true love could be just around the corner.The sub-plot which centres around Hitch's most challenging project, an overweight accountant called Albert who fancies a celebrity, is just as compelling to watch as the main relationship between Hitch and Sara. I loved how events were fabricated in a way that was both realistic considering the characters which they involved and the manner in which obstacles were overcome. The best part though had to be when this client's life began taking a toll on Hitch's personal relations, yet he realised his responsibility to Albert as a professional consultant meant that his priority was to fix that problem first.This was an excellent movie, which banishes the preconceived idea of romantic comedies being 'chick flicks', as both men and will enjoy it. The characters, acting and situations are top-notch and hope that more movies of this standard are made.",,Anonymous,Romance
Ehhh,"This was another Chick flick hidden behind a comedy trailer. Yes there were 1 or 2 other funny parts that weren't in the trailer. But the basis of this movie contains the same drab formula that every other predictable ""feel good"" chick flick has, with the exception of this one was much longer and dragged on and on. The movie was OK, but the plot has been done over and over.This movie reminded me a lot of the plot in ""Never been kissed"" except with the rolls reversed. Guy/Girl writes story about other guy/girl with the wrong information and guy/girl gets hurt but in the end everyone falls back in love and lives happily after after. I just wish there was some more character development, especially with the two main characters.",,Anonymous,Romance
Funny & charming!,This is a perfect movie to watch/re-watch in the time when we are all home far more and needing a laugh or two!Characters are pretty interesting and funny and plot of the movie is quite good with quite a few funny moments!,,Anonymous,Romance
What a great Movie- See Hitch for Sure!!,"Rarely is a movie made as clever as Hitch is. This is the best romantic comedy I have seen since ""Love Actually"". I laughed a lot and shed some tears as well. ""Hitch"" is a movie that everyone should see and realize that dating can be really difficult just like the movie but if you truly believe in love and give yourself time, you can really find the person that can change your life. New York City was a great place to film this. Perfect setting. Great cast. Will Smith was wonderful as Eve Mendes was. Kevin James was a hoot. I love his stand up and his role on ""King of Queens"". ""Hitch"" was a great role for him as a CPA. Very dynamic. Eva Mendes was great in this comedic role and of course Will is always good in comedies. Bravo to the screenwriter for doing great research on what dating these days is really like.I am going to see it many more times and purchase it when it comes out on DVD....!",,Anonymous,Romance
"Great, funny movie for everybody.","Hitch shows Will Smith at his best - funny, original and at times sophisticated. As Alex Hitchinson (short Hitch), he is the date doctor who shows poor souls how to impress women and treat them well. While helping other men as a 'private consultant', Hitch has to take some of his own medicine when he finds Sara (Eva Mendes). The visually appealing couple hits it off after some smart but sincere moves on the part of Hitch. Without wanting to spoil any of the essential parts of this movie, it's a hilarious flick for guys, girls, couples and just everybody interested in a quick LAUGH that lasts the whole two hours :))The dance scene at the end is hilarious. New York looks beautiful in many scenes.",,Anonymous,Romance
Great Feel Good Movie,"This movie is funny, slick and well put together.Will Smith proves what a good actor he is. He is capable of laughing at himself in the movie. He is as capable of doing action(I, Robot), drama(Ali) as he is capable of doing comedy(Men in Black 1 & 2, Hitch). He single handedly holds this film together and I think that the other characters revolve around him.However, when needed he is still capable of giving the other characters screen time to make their presence felt.The dialogue and music in this movie is witty and just plain entertaining. This is a romantic comedy that successfully takes a snapshot of todays males who run around in the dating game trying to locate the one - this movie shows what lengths people are willing to go to in their search for the perfect partner. Yet all we need to do is to be ourselves. This movie just shows that again. Despite all his charms and slick moves, things get screwed up and Hitch has to learn from life.Great Movie - I loved it!!",,Anonymous,Romance
Hitch is very good,"This flick was interesting - firstly because of the many mistakes guys do when trying to get a ""date"" & the outrageous things that can & often do happen.Will Smith again shows his diversity as the debonair - ""Date Doctor"" - Hilarity is the theme of this film - right down to the dancing at the end to the music of Heavy D.Andy Tennants direction seems to have been to give the cast ""room"" to develop the characters & its not pushed.......the film flows beautifully & is genuinely very very funny......without trying to be.Performances by Kevin James (Albert) , Amber Valetta (Allegra) - OUTSTANDING. brilliant choice on both. Refreshing & new, Loved this one, take the girls to this one guys - you'll both love this refreshing comedy.4 thumbs up for this story of ""true love"" comedy romance.",,Anonymous,Romance
hitch a great movie for romantic people...,"hi to everyone, i've seen the movie and i can say its a blast! it contains romance as well as comedy into one. the characters have portrayed their roles very well. each characters shows what they really feel about each other and does crazy things so that their love ones will be with them. many people can relate to their situation for it does happen in reality.it shows how one person either be it a boy or girl finds true love and succeeds whatever his/her status in life. no two people who shares the same passion be bored with this one. true love has its own mysterious ways of finding two people from both ends of the world. i would say its a ten! a great movie!",,Anonymous,Romance
Even Will Can't Save It,"Even an incredibly likable Will Smith can't save this romantic comedy that has too much sappy romance and not enough comedy.In Hitch, Will Smith has taken a break from his high-action movies to give a romantic comedy his talent. He plays a Manhattan date doctor who helps men with their romantic issues, but the real test comes when he also becomes interested in a newspaper reporter that is unaware of his line of work. Although the premise sounds original, when the movie gets moving it seems that we've heard it all before.It's also important that the romantic comedy has comedy. Without it a movie becomes a drama that's extremely cheesy, this is what Hitch is essentially. Comedy will break up the cheesiness and make the movie endearing. It also helps the audience see though the implausibility. I mean, at least add a funny best friend or something.Lastly, it should be a rule that romantic comedies should only be allowed to be less than 1 and a half hours. This movie pushes two hours. That's way too long, even for a good romantic comedy.",,Anonymous,Romance
I loved it... 5 stars,"This was a Great film...... I miss Big Will doing comedies, he cracks me up. I laughed pretty hard and really enjoyed this film. Now Kevin James, how can you not like him? He is one funny man. Now my hat goes off to Eva Mendes, nicely done. Now Michael Rapaport was a good surprise, I am never disappointed with anything he does. I also couldn't leave out the rest of the supporting cast who did an excellent job. This film was very entertaining and had the theater laughing consistently. If you are looking for a good Comedy with Romance, It is the perfect date film. The boy's can enjoy it and so can the girls. I give this film 5 stars on a scale of 1-5 stars. I highly recommend it. Paul J. Alessi",,Anonymous,Romance
Cute movie,Hitch is a great date movie. It is lively and upbeat. I would have personally waited and rented the movie instead. It was cute but not sensational. I could have waited for the DVD. Will Smith is great for the role. The co star was a new face and I can't think of her name but she did great also. Also the other actors did a great job. It was almost like two stories in one. I think it really showed a guys perception to dating. It is really hard for guys to make a good first impression. It really opened your eyes to the effort given to a first impression. My husband really enjoyed it also. The scenery was great and their was also some surprises. The movie is just as good as the previews.,,Anonymous,Romance
A Nutshell Review: Hitch,"Hitch's a date doctor. Got a problem with initiating contact with the woman of your dreams? Then Hitch's your consultant for hire - he'll teach you the ropes, and by 3 dates, you'll know if it can or cannot work out, if you follow his advice that is. But he draws the lines with jerks. In the first meeting with you, he'll size you up in minutes, to see if you're someone worth working with/for, or to walk away from.For the guys, this movie shares with you many good date tips, so much so that you'll sometimes be at a lost with the barrage of tips, or at times go ""that's common sense!"", or even, ""hey, I know/can do that!"" For the girls, I guess it's good fun to know the extent and fear each guy go through just to ask you out - sometimes things go fine, sometimes they just go awry, and it happens even to a smooth operator like Hitch!The film opens with Will Smith talking to the camera, kinda like Alfie, but Smith can do no wrong. From action (Bad Boys, Independence Day) to drama (Ali) to Sci-fi (I, Robot), and now romantic comedy, he has anchored himself as a leading man, whose name on the marquee can open any movie. Kevin James is comedy fodder as Albert, the man whom Hitch coaches - those dance moves you saw in the trailer, well, there's more! Eva Mendes star as Hitch's opposite number, a cynical gossip columnist who's after the dirt between Albert and babe Amber Valletta.There are many memorable scenes in this movie, but my personal favourite is when Hitch and Sara first interact in a pub. I laugh at lame pick up lines/attempts, but this one - the banter's really smart and witty, and best of all, the lush sounds of Everything But The Girl's Five Fathoms is playing in the background. Tracey Thorn rocks, and the scene, perfect. Peppered throughout the movie are contemporary pop songs that you surely can identify.But as with most romantic comedies, the plot's formulaic - boy meets girl, boy loses girl, and the endings are usually cop-outs and happily-ever-afters. But I'm not finding fault - this film addresses timeless, current and real-life dating issues, and it redeemed itself with a hilarious ending scene to what is an enjoyable flick.",,Anonymous,Romance
"""Hitch"" has a great premise, but is weak in the follow-though.","Will Smith played a great leading man, doing what he could with the weak dialogue. Kevin James is absolutely hilarious as the fumbling supporting role, showing his best physical comedy. I really thought that Eva Mendes was weak, and not able to match Smith's performance. Overall, it's a cute movie that has hilarious moments, but is still the typical Romantic Comedy (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). The movie does do a good job of telling the story, interweaving the characters together, although it took a while to wrap up. It's a great date movie, or if you're a Romantic Comedy or Will Smith fan, I'd suggest seeing it, other than that, wait until it comes out on video...",,Anonymous,Romance
One of Smith's best roles,"Hitch (2005) Will Smith, Eva Mendez, Kevin James, Amber Valletta, Julie Ann Emery, D: Andy Tennant. Smith shows off his movie star magnetism and slickster charisma playing Hitch the Date Doctor, a New York City professional dating consultant who offers tips and coaching to hapless bachelors. His latest client is a shy and tubby accountant (James) who wants to win over a rich and beautiful socialite, but Hitch has his own problems when he starts to fall for smart gossip columnist Mendez, who has the power to see right through him. Even if it's a bit too long given the forgone conclusion, this entertaining romantic-comedy is both smart and funny (a rarity for today) without relying all on slapstick, and TV's sitcom King of Queens star James is hilarious. 115 min., rated PG-13. ***",,Anonymous,Romance
Dating by numbers but a good score,"This is an ideal date movie because, if you're just starting a relationship, you're bound to be able to identify with some features of at least one of the four central characters.First up, there's the date doctor, Alex 'Hitch' Hitchens (the cute Will Smith), who has lots of sound advice on how a man should woo a woman, but manages to strike some wrong notes when he himself attempts to romance cynical newspaper columnist Sara (Eva Mendes). Then there's gauche but kind-hearted accountant Albert (weighty Kevin James) who is advised by Hitch on his seemingly-impossible quest to make it with poor little rich girl Allegra Cole (model Amber Valletta).Does it work out for our two couples? Heh, this is a rom-com from Hollywood, so all bets are safe, but a better than average script from Kevin Bisch provides lots of verbal and visual gags that made even this long-married romantic smile.",,Anonymous,Romance
good movie,"i really enjoyed this movie!! one of the few which i would probably want to see again and spend my money spending another like 10 dollars.i thought the movie was really cute and funny. i would recommend it. i basically like any movie with will smith in it. i love him!! but i would tell anyone to go see this movie.i really enjoyed it and some of the events in the movie actually happen in real life so its funny to see the comparison from in the movie and then in actuality. i would definitely use my money to see this movie again in theaters. me and my friends really liked and thought it was a goodmovie. so, if you are ever wondering if u should see this movie, go and see it because it is worth it and I'm sure you'll enjoy it.",,Anonymous,Romance
a familiar formula used effectively,"Alex Hitchens is the cure for the common man, a New York City ""date doctor"" who makes a living by dispensing invaluable relationship advice to his comrades which they in turn use to woo the women of their dreams. He has his work cut out for him when he meets Albert Brennaman (James), a financial consultant and chronic doofus who's head over heels in love with a rich and powerful heiress. Hitch also finds his own personal challenge when he meets the jaded Sara (Mendes), a gorgeous gossip columnist and careerist whose dedication to her work and firm guard against the opposite sex throws him for a loop. Formulaic at times, especially as it nears its conclusion, but charming and laugh-out loud funny thanks to a very appealing cast, not to mention an engaging script that would be particularly insightful for those who are socially challenged. An enjoyable, old-fashioned date movie. ***",,Anonymous,Romance
Eva Mendes' can't act,"This movie would've been so much better if Eva Mendes had not been casted. Sure she is very pretty, but she just couldn't act. Even the supermodel did a good acting job. Watching her stand next to Will Smith, who is an amazing actor, really hurt the movie. Everything was really cute and funny and sweet except for her. I also felt that the portrayal of Asian women was quite negative. Why did she have to be the one lying in bed? I was pleasantly surprised though, at the lack of sexual scenes. That was a definite plus! I also felt that it would've been nice to see someone as handsome as Will Smith chasing after a dark skinned black woman. These days dark skinned black women aren't given leading roles as the beauty that men chase after. Is this because all dark skinned black women are ugly? No way! I would like to see a dark skinned black woman be able to be the star in a movie that a man, black, white, Asian, Hispanic, a man of any race, is chasing after.",,Anonymous,Romance
There is a logic error in the plot,"Hi,I've watched the movie and I consider it a good funny romance. However, I was rather disappointed when I spotted a mistake in the logic of events. Remember the scene in the Park, when Sara and her colleague journalist are waiting to meet the ""nasty guy"" Vance had worked with in his efforts to conquer Sara's friend? And Sara's colleague is asked by Hitch where did he get the reference from? Sara's colleague says: ""From Albert Brennaman"" Why did he say this? How did he connect Albert Brennaman with the consultant Vance had used? They didn't know that Hitch knows Vance in any way!!! They knew only that Hitch connects with Albert and that Vance connects with a ""bad guy""!!!",,Anonymous,Romance
"Question, please answer asap.","My step son would like to see this movie, and my husband and I were questioning whether or not it is appropriate for him to see. So my question is (obviously) Is this movie appropriate for a 12 year old boy? How much sexual content is there? Is there any nudity? Is there too much adult humor that he would not get, or is it stuff he would be able to get? He is a normal 12 year old. If you can call any 12 year old normal =) Is it really worth paying the money to take him to it? I know that it started out with a low rating and I want to make sure that it is not just a waste of my money. We are hoping to take him sometime soon. Within this next week. So responses as soon as possible are very much appreciated.",,Anonymous,Romance
Liked it and I'm in the same business,"I tend to be a big fan of Will Smith. He has been in movies such as Men in Black, Ali, Independence Day, Enemy of The State , Bad Boys, The Legend of Baggar Vance , Six Degrees of Separation as well as his role in television as the Fresh Prince of Bel Air.So when I saw Will Smith was going to star in a movie called ""Hitch"" where he was a date doctor I was more than intrigued. Alex Hitch helps shy men get with women they desire in 3 dates or less. This is very similar to what my firm does with men and our workshops.While Smith and his charm were certainly up to the task of playing an advice-dispensing date doctor who has trouble following his own rules. Hitch falls for Sara but has a lot of trouble dealing with her as he has trouble dealing with love itself due to a heart brake in college.Alex hooks up numerous client's with dates throughout the movie, but the major hook up is with his client Albert who wishes to get together with the celebrity known as Alegra Cole who is a super-rich and famous heiress. Hitch loves the challenge. He says if he was Michelangelo, he'd consider Albert his ""Sistine Chapel"".If you like Will Smith and Kevin James than you'll more than likely like this movie. I found it light hearted, humorous with some actually decent advice.I could find one big argument Alex Hitch was doing was that he was helping guys get confidence with women through only one girl. This is the part that just doesn't ring true to me.I found it entertaining to watch Alex Hitch pick up Sara Melas. He played the hero, got relaxed and had fun with her words as he twisted what she was going to say. Their date was rather creative as well as following dates.Albert's dates with Allegra Cole were just as entertaining. I have to admit I laughed a few times. Albert's charm , and zest for winning over Allegra Cole were heartwarming.This is a GREAT date movie. Every girl I've talked to has loved it. So if you're looking for something fun to do with a girl on a date, take her to see Hitch. I'll be adding this movie to my personal movie collection when it comes out on DVD.The Sparks between Sara Melas and Alex Hitch could have been a little bit stronger.Overall I'd give it 4.5 stars out of 5.Robert Torrey",,Anonymous,Romance
Question about a Line in the Movie,"I saw ""Hitch"" last night and let me tell you i LOVED it!! It was amazingly funny and sweet there were so many parts and lines in the movies i loved!! I plan to see it many more times!!! It doesn't surprise me, though, that i liked it so much i don't think there is a Will Smith movie i have seen that i didn't love and enjoy watching. there is, however, a part in the movie when Hitch and Sara were about to have dinner and Hitch made a toast. His toast was an amazing quote that i would like to add to my quote book i have. The problem: i cant remember the full quote. It started like this: ""Never lie, steal, cheat or drink.."" could anyone possible finish the quote for me?",,Anonymous,Romance
Need to know a quote,Does anyone know the quote were Kevin James (Albert Brennamen) talks about how a person wants someone they love to be happy even if it isn't with them. Its the line he says to Hitch when they first meet. I cant find it. Believe it or not this is a great quote. Kevin James is awesome. So is will smith but i think this was Kevins breakout performance. Ill give Eva Mendez credit..she was good but she was a total pain in the butt. Alegra on the other hand...she had he moments but for the most part i didn't really think she was all that. The best part of the whole movie though was deff. the end at the marriage. When the whole group did the should train dance line...that was great. Yeah but seriously i need to know what that line was.,,Anonymous,Romance
Romantic comedy with substance,"This movie dealt with the hopes and fears of finding true love in a person's life. It's romantic comedic format allowed a humorous exploration of the sometimes painful vulnerabilities and emotions experienced by men and women in finding romance in their lives.It begins with basic principles that anyone who has played the game of dating will recognize all too well, and as the plot develops through the interaction of Hitch and Albert in their seeking ""the moments that take their breath away"", that all romantic comedies afford, one begins to see these basic principles in a whole new light.It was a refreshing change of pace to see the dating game from a man's point of view. Issues of inadequacy and lack of confidence were addressed with stock comedic situations in the comparison of Hitch's budding relationship with Sara and Albert's budding relationship with Allegra, and done in such a way that the reality of it gave this romantic comedy a depth of drama that everyone can relate to in their lives. It's a keeper. It is one I will watch again and again.",,Anonymous,Romance
