This town deserves a better class of criminal!,"This movie is a work of art. The finest sequel ever made. I don't think we will see another movie like this for a long time. Heath Ledger's Joker is the best movie charachter I have ever seen by far. Avengers Endgame is great, but The Dark Knight is much better. The best Batman ever! The best Joker ever!

MASTERPIECE,"It is just what you want for the best movie. Great story great acting, thrilling twist.

The Dark Knight,"Confidently directed, dark, brooding, and packed with impressive action sequences and a complex story, The Dark Knight includes a career-defining turn from Heath Ledger as well as other Oscar worthy performances, TDK remains not only the best Batman movie, but comic book movie ever created.",,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Film surpasses the hype,"We've been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.Bale's Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling.As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.This isn't an action movie. It's a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because it's all in there.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Heath Ledger's Dark and Brilliant Swan Song,"I couldn't believe ""The Dark knight"" could live up to the hype. That's perhaps the biggest surprise. The secret, I believe, is a stunning, mature, intelligent script. That makes it the best superhero movie ever made. As if that wasn't enough, Heath Ledger. He, the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something we'll never see. A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately, Christian Bale's Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. ""The Dark Knight"" is visually stunning, powerful and moving. What else could anyone want.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"
A Batman Of Shakesperean Proportions,"Dark, yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. ""The Dark Knight"" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!",9.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9979,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Fantastic!,"Im just gonna start off by saying I LOVE this movie.Its one of my favorites of all time. I honestly cant think of too much wrong with this movie other than its a little long and Batmans by now infamous voice. But everything else is top notch. The acting,story,atmosphere,and actions scenes are all amazing. If you haven't seen this movie see it right now! I went into this not expecting to much but I came out blown away, I cant imagine any movie being much better. I'll just have to wait for The Dark Knight Rises to release to see if anything can be better. Until then, this stands as the best movie I've ever seen",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9979,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Watch the IMAX version if you can,"I had the pleasure to watch this movie in an IMAX theatre in London (it advertises itself, with the slogan ""Biggest screen in the UK""), which was one of the greatest movie experiences I had in my life. And it was my first movie in an IMAX theatre. I can only recommend it for anyone who has the chance to watch it, even if not the entire movie is shot for an IMAX theatre, this still is able to blow someone away! Great visuals combined with a great story and superb acting.The movie could also have been called ""The Joker"", but even with Heath Ledgers great performance, this still is a Batman movie. And ""The Dark Knight"" is clear enough, even without the Batman in the title. I simply loved the movie, but I heard some complaints from some friends. It seems that some might have a problem with the depiction of the characters (I loved Heath Ledger, but there are a few out there who would have wanted to see him even crazier) or the plot threads (especially what is done with the character of Aaron Eckhart). Although I can see why that might be a problem for fans of the comic books, I still stand by my vote. This is the best Batman movie ever (until hopefully Nolan and Bale make the next one)!",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9979,"Action, Crime, Drama"
"Surpasses ""Begins"" in every aspect!!!","Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy ""The Dark Knight"" EXCEEDED all  of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman  franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it,  amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more  gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times  throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to  fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if  his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his  fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the  help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael  Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But  the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly  enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack  Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker.  He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY  disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime  and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original  cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal  and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a  much better performance and is a far cry from the ""damsel-in-distress""  stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in  films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around  more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly  improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than ""Begins""  in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal.  Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the  film an added frosting to an already delicious cake.  Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than ""Begins."" The  action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud  Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who  sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing  in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may  feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I  will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor  him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a  human being and father to his daughter Matilda  Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his  daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this  role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented  actor.  Rest in peace.

One of the Best Superhero movies EVER!!!!!!!,"I saw the dark knight about three years ago when I was in the 8th grade. And I was blown away at how beautifully done it was, the camera work, the acting, the story, it all took me by surprise. It is to this day one of the best movies I have ever seen or will see. No other movie can impact you in such an intense way than The Dark Knight. It is a movie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time and effort into this one film and they did not want to waste money putting up garbage. So Christopher Nolan, thank you for not wasting our time, instead earning our time with this film. To this day I still am anxious to see the movie at home. I recommend it to anyone who likes action movies in general. To anyone who doesn't, don't waste your time write bad reviews about this film.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9979,"Action, Crime, Drama"
The sequel we deserved to the Batman we wanted,"I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel ""Star Wars"" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for ""Dark Knight"".Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, ""Dark Knight"" ably stands on its own with or without ""Batman Begins"". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the ""Batman"" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in ""Batman Forever"", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.""The Dark Knight"" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"

"Oh, come on, people, this is not one of the 250 great movies of all time","I will say up front that I have never seen a movie based on a comic book that I really liked, except the animated ones, or the quasi-animated, like _Sin City_. You would think the graphic novel and film would have a lot in common, but in the end they're trading in different kinds of images.This is basically just another Batman movie. Same silly premise, that a super-rich hero battles --- over the shrinking remnants of Gotham city --- villains with seemingly unlimited resources in personnel and explosives.I will agree that Heath Ledger's performance is amazing. Can this be the same guy who played the gay cowboy in that other movie? It is a real pity that he died. I can't help but thinking that if he were still alive, and we were wondering what he would do next with his great talent, this movie would not have an average rating of 9.0 (as of this writing).There are a lot of other fine actors (Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, for crying out loud) who are basically wasted pretending to take their characters seriously.I did like the heist sequence at the beginning, including the Joker's first few lines and the bit with the bus. Really very droll; gets your hopes up. But, from then on, it's just a lot of people being blown up while the survivors emote angst --- dark, brooding, comic-book angst.",6.0,Anonymous,0.0005,0.9995,-0.999,"Action, Crime, Drama"

This isn't just the best Batman movie ever made, this is one of the best movie ever made. Everything in this film is excellent, not one piece of annoyance.Bale marvels as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Ledger has made The Joker in to an iconic movie villain. His performance belongs there at the top with Hopkins Lecter. The Joker has finally been portrait properly on film, he has earned his place between the big boys in movie villandom. This is the true Joker every Batman fan knows, loves and fears. Ledger deserves any and every movie award known to man for this brilliant display.Nolan has made his ""I will always be remembered"" movie, this is the crownjewel in his portfolio.

Heath Ledger is a ledgend!,"Well here it is, one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. How was it? It was excellent. By far the best Batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while.Everyone was waiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heath's other films like '10 Things I Hate About You' and even 'Brokeback Mountain' proves that this man could actually act, doesn't matter what character, he could do it.The film's storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each scene, making you wonder what's next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion.During the film on the scene with Batman against the Joker, Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No, it kept going which was awesome, the story kept getting darker and darker, I guess that's why they called it the 'Dark' Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself.The cast was great. With Christopher Nolan playing Batman, good performance, Heath Ledger played extremely well, Maggie was annoying at times, but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. Aaron Eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch.Great directing made the movie enjoyable, they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful, lighting was done well especially showing Harvey/ Two Face's face in the many moods he displayed.Great explosions made it entertaining. Made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time.This movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor Heath Ledger's life. (May he R.I.P) His performance made what this film is right now.I recommend this film for any action fan, especially a Batman fan. Or if your even a Heath Ledger fan.

In the film, he is portrayed as an ultra-intelligent person with a psychopathic ""brain"". Honestly, I was very surprised that someone known for their niche productions would play such a good role as one of the most important characters in the Batman series. Unfortunately, we will probably never see the joker so well again, because Heath Ledger, from unknown circumstances, died. This is sad news. However, back to the movie. The main character, Batman, played by Christian Bale, also shows the character very well. Therefore, my rating for this movie is 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"

There is no doubt about it.But i see some people who don't mind to compare this movie with some old masterpieces and say the dark knight is the best movie so far.Haha, this is completely unacceptable.Let me clear this: If a movie can bring freshness to creativity, If a movie happens to change your insights, If a movie starts a new genre, gives away new techniques and styles, If a movie makes you understand your heart better; then I call that movie a masterpiece.

Heath Ledger makes this great,"Batman takes on the crime lords with the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent.

In the end, this is Heath Ledger's movie. He overpowers everybody. His early death may have immortalized him, but my opinion isn't inflated. His presence is electric. It helps that his character is so ridiculously crazy. His motivation has nothing to do with power or money which is so mundane. He wants chaos and that is so much more fascinating.

Amazing non-stop action and eye-popping skyscraper scenes!,"I first need to point out that I generally hate action films--they just aren't a genre I generally would go to see. However, my teenage daughter saw the film and DEMANDED that we immediately go to an IMAX-equipped theater and see it as soon as possible. Had I not agreed, I think she would have threatened force or threaten to leave home, so I reluctantly agreed. I'm pointing all this out up front so you'll understand that if I didn't give this movie a 10 and found a few minor problems with the plot, it's probably because of my bias. However, for me to give an action film a 9 is very, very unusual--it was a terrific film and almost earns a 10.As far as action goes, it was nearly non-stop and there were more eye-popping stunts in it than nearly any film you could see. Plus, I truly recommend that if you do have an IMAX theater nearby that is showing it you go there and not to a regular theater. The sounds, the sights and the action are just amazing on this huge screen--and in hindsight I probably should have taken my hearing aids out before the film began--I DIDN'T need them! For many, this will make the film a must-see, though I admit that it was was a bit tiring after a while--for an old fogy like myself, maybe there was a bit too much action--though teens and action fans will adore it.The characters were excellent--with the possible exception of Batman. He was fine, but I wish he'd have stopped mumbling in his deep voice. This made him a lot less interesting and perhaps less likable than the villains!! As for the villains, the Joker was great and very, very sadistic and I liked Harvey Dent as well (especially after his cool makeup job late in the film). Oddly, perhaps my favorite character was a guy who was only a bit character--Tommy 'Tiny' Lister who played one of the scariest prisoners I have ever seen in film. His bit part on the ferry boat was really exceptional.Overall, this film is better than any superhero film I have ever seen and much better than the earlier Batman films. My only serious problem was the ending--what Gordon and Batman agree to do made no sense at all and wasn't necessary. Still, with such amazing eye-candy, who am I to complain? A wonderful ride and a must-see movie for action and superhero fans. HOWEVER, it is a very violent film intended for adults--I would not take kids or even some teens to the film--it's THAT dark and intense.As of today (7/26/08), this is by far the highest rated film on IMDb. If these numbers can be believed, this film is better than THE GODFATHER, CASABLANCA, GONE WITH THE WIND and 12 ANGRY MEN!

"""The Dark Knight"" finally realizes the full potential of the Batman mythology","Cards (hardy har har) on the table: Going into ""The Dark Knight"" in IMAX I did not think Christopher Nolan was a great director, I was not too taken by ""Batman Begins"" (although it was refreshing after Burton and Schumacher reminded me of the lesser Batman comics I have read, and, bizarrely for non-comedies, of the 60's television series and the film version of that, except less fun), I did not think Heath Ledger was among the great actors of his generation, I did not think Christian Bale was the best actor alive, and I was not expecting anything more than an entertaining Batman movie, despite being reassured by everyone I trust about movies that it was much more.Having seen it, as intended with the scenes filmed specifically for IMAX intact and covering the entire IMAX screen vertically, I can safely say that ""The Dark Knight"" is without question the first time the Batman character and the many great comics based in Gotham City have been done justice on film. Nolan's version of Batman is not meant to be realistic, it is meant to be plausible, and everything here including Two-Face feels plausible. Still, the film has not forsaken its comic book roots. This is not the watered-down Batman of the 50's, this is the Batman conceived in the 30's and re-born in the 80's. Moments here, thanks to Ledger's astonishingly creepy and believable performance as the Joker (this is the original Joker. Bank robber with no motive, mass-murderer with not a hint of mercy, not the ludicrous clown Jack Nicholson horribly portrayed in Burton's 1989 effort), recall the great Batman book ""Arkham Asylum"". Others recall ""The Killing Joke"". As anyone who has read those books will testify, that is just about the highest praise I can give the portrayal of the Joker here.I do think that seeing this in IMAX enhances the experience, although it is a little annoying when the picture clarity goes from as clear as possible to clearly blown-up when the scene switches from those shot on IMAX cameras to those shot on regular film. One can really appreciate the sound design here as well, which is absolutely remarkable all the way through.This is, as far as I'm concerned, easily Nolan's best work as director. His handling of the film's pacing is absolutely stunning, and the action here is both filmed and edited much better than in ""Begins"". It is Nolan's work with actors that particularly impresses, with just about every moment of acting being superb here. Of course, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are phoning it in but they don't exactly need to be brilliant here. Bale, as well, displays little depth as Wayne, but embodies all his charm and makes for an excellent Batman (unless your perception of Batman is a wisecracking fool, then you might be disappointed). No, the acting I refer to here is the extraordinary performances by Ledger, Oldman, and Eckhart. Although Ledger will surely get all the attention (and he's certainly great here), I think that both Oldman and Eckhart stole the show a bit. Eckhart is better as Dent than Two-Face but the transformation is certainly not an easy task for any actor. Maggie Gyllenhaal is unquestionably better as Rachel Dawes than Katie Holmes was, and Nestor Carbonell, not an actor with much range, is really very good as the Mayor of Gotham City.Over and over again film versions of Batman have disappointed. Has ""The Dark Knight"" finally got it right? No doubt some will moan and complain about it not being distinctive or stylized enough, not capturing the spirit of the comics. Guess what? You have been reading the WRONG comics. The best Batman comics may not always strive for plausibility, but they are certainly far from the 'silly fun' some might expect from ""The Dark Knight"". What you will get here is a tense, dramatic crime thriller with some breathtaking action set-pieces, remarkable characterization. The Joker being given such a complex psychological profile is a stunning achievement, and Ledger is terrifying in the role. You really believe that he is dangerous and his sick social experiments are nerve-wracking to witness.I have one or two misgivings about ""The Dark Knight"". I don't know if I would have handled Rachel Dawes and Harvey Dent/Two-Face the way the Nolan brothers do in this screenplay, but virtually the rest of the film is pitch-perfect. The pace is astonishing (I could hardly believe the film was as long as it actually was), the acting is phenomenal, the visual look of the film is right, especially given the subtext Nolan is going for here (which you'll see when you've seen the film), the characters are rich, the drama is real, the action is spectacular, and finally- The Joker is given a definitive portrayal.Tim Burton once said, ""Anyone who knows me knows I would never read a comic book"". For shame, Mr. Burton. Maybe if you had you could have made something this good. ""The Dark Knight"" does the character of Batman justice, it does The Joker justice, and it does the great Batman comics justice. In two and a half hours ""The Dark Knight"" makes up for all the silly, offensive garbage adapted from comic books and graphic novels, and reveals just how much can be done with the characters and ideas in those books. This is finally a film that does justice to the Batman universe.",,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Love this movie,"This Is probably the second best sequel of all time, second only to the return of the king. I've seen this movie twice in cinema this year, that's just how good it is. I could name very few flaws in this movie. This movie has some of the best preformances of all time. Heath ledgers preformance is nothing short of phenomenal and arguably the best preformance we've ever been given in a superhero film. However I believe Aaron eckhart plays his role as two-face to perfection which is severely overshadowed by Heath ledgers. Definitely one of those movies you can watch numerous times. Christopher nolan is a brilliant director 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"
R.I.P. Heath Ledger. This portray of Joker will never be forgotten.,"Lets begin by stating that this movie should only be watched in IMAX. If you are a big Batman fanatic, spend a couple extra dollars and you'll get your money's worth.This is the best movie of 2008, no other film will come close.Christopher Nolan has made his masterpiece, with the help of his brother Jonathan creating the script. The perfect balance between superhero action and drama can be found here in The Dark Knight.The acting is top-notch. Not a single actor in this movie comes up short. Christian Bale portrays Batman better than he did in its predecessor. Aaron Eckhart impresses with his take of Harvey Dent. Maggie does a fantastic job playing the role of Rachel Dawes. Heath Ledger is Oscar worthy in his attempt at the infamous Batman rival, The Joker. Ledger's performance is just absolutely stunning. No words can describe how much he attracts the viewer and shines on the big screen.There is no reason why anyone should say this movie was bad. Those who gave this movie a poor rating should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of intelligence. Yes I said. LACK OF INTELLIGENGE! Even if your not a Batman fanatic, this film has a meaning and purpose. It will give you excitement and also something to ponder about for the rest of the day, night, morning, etc.No spoilers but its lengthy running time of 152 minutes beats the hell out of any other superhero comic book adaptation previously made and for years to come. Ledger's stunning acting portrayal of the Joker is good enough for you to spend the money. Do not wait for it to come out on DVD, WATCH IT IN IMAX!",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Really good but not as 4th best movie of all time. That's just clear.,"In my opinion, this movie a bit over-hyped and a bit over-rated actually. Is this movie better than 12 Angry Men or Schindler's List or The Return Of The King? Absoulutely not. Amazing acting and amazing cinematography and a very good screenplay but not good as the movies that I counted. This is a Nolan movie this can't be bad for real, this is very good actually. But I'm saying it is just not good as Godfather Part II. It's common Comic movies are over-rated sometimes but this is over-rated more with death of Heath Ledger. I think it could be highest rated super-hero movie, I'm truly okey with it, I'm just saying this should be on Top 30~ not in Top 5.",8.0,Anonymous,0.9986,0.0014,0.9973,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Bat-A-Man!,"There is just one thing that differentiates a legend from ordinary man. It's his fight with inner demons to over come all his fear. That defines a legend. And this is what Batman stands for. Batman is not just another comic character but it's a complete saga of how you stand tall in spite of losing everything, walk fearlessly even when you are lonely and how you fight back against all odds and over shadow your own fear. Fear- the most dominated emotion, mankind has ever witnessed. Batman is no exception, he still has fear, he still gets scared of losing those who are close to him and he is still in doubts when it comes to decision. But what is interesting and inspirational about Batman is that he has the ability to use wisely the biggest and most dangerous weapons of all time perfectly- BRAIN! That's why he is my favourite comic character and this time, Batman is putting everything on the line to save the world from out of control freak- the Joker.A spell bounded performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker. Though, he is no more with us but his immortal act as joker is an Oscar winning performance and will always be remembered. Your heart comes out to mouth to see the horror Joker creates. In start, I was bit confused as his performance reminded me of Jack Nicholson from the first Batman movie but later, I realised that this is for real. He did not imitate Jack but showcased the true and horrible side of a real joker. The best part about Heath is that he displayed the flip side of a joker- FEARLESS. There are many times when we feel that some one could have done better with certain roles but not here. Here, Heath is perfect as a joker and from now on, I will call him Heath 'Joker' Ledger!The story is about a terror that has shaken the underworld of Gotham. The fear of Batman is getting in to criminal minds and all of them are now thinking where their money can be saved from Batman's reach. And that's where the Joker comes with a plan to these criminals- kill Batman. Now with his perverted mind, the Joker is behind Batman's life and what follows is a scary hell of a ride of hide n seek game of faith vs. courage. At one end, Joker has no fear and on the other, Batman has a responsibility of saving Gotham. Now the important question is that who will win and more than that at what cost?Apart from breaking box office records, this movie is also able to break the pattern of film making. Batman series is an action series. When you make an action movie you give the required pace in a movie by focusing on elaborating the action scenes but here, the director builds the movie with a mix of action as well as other emotional scenes. Step by step movie gives its audience action and emotion at the time when it's required but with an unexpected style. Dark, intense and a complete Batman style.The Batman movies are famous for its back ground music and The Dark Knight is no exception. Specially, when there is sound of a whistle in background of some intense scenes in the movie. I felt a rush in to my blood and boiling my brain. My eyes popped out while watching those scenes. To mention, Batman's grilling session with the Joker is a masterpiece. The scene was simply awesome mainly coz of background music.Harvey Dent's character could have been better post he becomes 2-faced. I was expecting his character to be more involved and longer in the series. Rachel Dawes is also a very strong influencing character in the movie. Her involvement in the movie is much focused than Katie Holmes in Batman Begins but the point I'm making here is the glam factor in this movie. She was not given that much footage in a glamorous way. Nevertheless, the plot did not allow audience to think that way either. Action scenes in this movie are well thought of and will chill the audiences' spinal chords. My favourite is the chase scene where Joker is trying best to catch Harvey Dent and how Batman comes in between. This is where Batman says 'asta la vista' and welcomes his new girl friend- his damn new bike! It's called Batpod! I can imagine how excited you will be when you know that Batman is now going to catch the Joker and Joker is happy that Batman has missed his shot. This is sheer delight to watch the creative involvement of special effects blended with brilliant cinematography.Unlike other Hollywood flicks, The Dark Knight is a lengthy movie of more than 2 ½ hrs of non-stop adrenaline but you won't mind spending that much time watching it. Many times we feel that some movies could've been shorter and some lengthier but with 'The Dark Knight' that's not the case. It's mainly because the movie ends up at the time when it is required to scroll the curtains down. I was so satisfied while coming out from the movie hall. Perfect ending!Well, The Dark Knight is just a beginning. Now I'm expecting the Penguin and the Riddler to come in to the picture and take this battle ahead.As I said earlier, I'm a big fan of Batman and after this movie, I'm mad about not just Batman, but each and every part of his movies, music and, The Joker!. Now, while I'm rushing straight to the nearest movie store to buy all original movies and soundtracks of Batman series, you go ahead and enjoy a fearless life just like the Joker or Batman- choice is yours!",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"

One did not need to watch Batman Begins to understand The Dark Knight, despite these movies being in a series.

Aren't we a little overblown about Dark Night movie?,"The Dark Knight actually got lucky. Movies over the last six years have been crap. Scripts poorly written, over budgeted for the visual effect - yet not transferring well to the big screen, bad story ideas, copy cats of other films,lack of creativity, films that hold vulgarity and violence as a high standard of film making. That's what we've had over the years. Now comes Batman - Dark Knight. Which is written well enough but whose aim isn't good story telling. It's written to move about from pointless spot to pointless spot until you reach the end. Why another Batman Joker movie? It's been done already.It has a mindless assembly-line quality to it as each scene is repeated over and over during the 2 1/2 hours of this film. The scenes are different only by location and a few faces. Something bad happens, the joker appears, Batman appears. Then the joker disappears and Batman disappears. Over and over and over again.The other big comment people had made about this movie is that it is very dark. Like that's a good thing. I don't get it. Maybe because I've had too many real life experiences that were truly dark. Motion pictures trying to have this quality and then for others to celebrate this seems ignorant and not very entertaining.

The Best Comic Book Movie Ever.!!,"When Batman Begins was released in the year 2005, I watched it and wondered seeing the ending scene where the joker was revealed to be the villain in the next installment of the series, that well how Christopher Nolan is gonna incorporate the funny, playful and completely insane character of the Joker in to his dark and serious version of Batman..So when I went to watch this movie, I was ready to see the Heath Ledger's Joker cracking some jokes, blowing up lots of places, killing tons of people, going way beyond insane and of course laughing a lot.. But the joker I saw was rather just the opposite. He did blow up buildings, he did kill people, he did go insane and laugh, but he did all of this with a motive and a touch of control and calmness to it..Its been a while since I have seen a movie where the villain shines more than the hero and in this movie Heath Ledger's Joker completely stole the show. Everything he does seems reasonable and the things that he says feels honest and true. The movie grips you throughout its 152min runtime. Christopher Nolan nailed it and showed how comic book characters can be taken out of their colorful world, put in a dark and serious movie and make it work..Other actors also played their part well, Christian Bale was good as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Aaron Eckhart was brilliant as Harvey Dent, Gary Oldman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman played their roles beautifully.This movie is one of my favorite movies of all time, For those of you who haven't watched it yet, I recommend you watch it as soon as possible because this kind of gems come rarely..",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9979,"Action, Crime, Drama"

A Personal Odyssey Through Shadows and Resolve,"Watching The Dark Knight felt like stepping into a gritty, pulsating underworld where every shadow whispered its own story. I was immediately drawn into Gotham's turbulent energy, feeling as though I were standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Batman in his relentless crusade against chaos. Heath Ledger's Joker wasn't merely a villain; he was an unpredictable force-a storm of anarchic brilliance that challenged everything I thought I knew about morality. The film's gritty realism, meticulously choreographed action sequences, and deeply nuanced performances resonated with me on a profoundly personal level. As I navigated through Gotham's maze of despair and determination, I found reflections of my own internal battles between idealism and pragmatism. In every scene, the film laid bare the complexities of heroism and the haunting cost of sacrifice, leaving me to ponder how the darkest parts of ourselves can sometimes illuminate our greatest strengths. The Dark Knight isn't just a superhero movie-it's a raw, unforgettable exploration of the duality of human nature, reminding us that sometimes the most heroic act is simply to confront the chaos within.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9979,"Action, Crime, Drama"
The Dark Knight is a rarity in Hollywood,"The phenomenal The Dark Knight reigns as the greatest superhero film of all time. From its exhilarating first frame to it's bittersweet last, among the great strengths of The Dark Knight is the way it combines hardboiled naturalism with the kind of stunts, mysterious and pulsating almost from start to finish and the most thematically sophisticated, most philosophically profound, most narratively complex, unsettling reflection on the increasingly blurry boundaries between good and evil.
Nolan's constantly keeps us off-balance and fills us with breathless anticipation for the next stunning turn-of-events so What you finally receive from The Dark Knight, then, isn't a message but a sensation, which comes from the deliberately twisted form, you learn how it feels to be in a vortex that just keeps sucking you down.
To talk of Heath Ledger's performance is difficult, merely because, as gigantic as it is, it is only one important feature of an intricately wrought canvas.
It's not just the best Batman film ever. It's not just the best superhero movie ever. It's more than a money-spinner, a franchise, a comic-book cash-in.

Not as good as most people would have you believe,"The Dark Knight is an intensely powerful, dramatic and compelling film, but despite that I'm not sure I really enjoyed it a great deal. I saw it on the huge IMAX screen in London, which has an ability to almost suck you into the action and make you feel a part of the film, but at the same time various aspects of the film meant that I felt alienated from the characters and the plot.Who is Batman, and what do we really know about him? After having watched the whole film (all 2.5 hours of it), I'm not sure I could say. What are his motives? Does he really love Rachel - indeed does he have the capacity to love at all? Again, hints are given, but the central character is so poorly developed that it makes it hard to really care about what happens to him or those around him.My inability to empathise with the characters wasn't helped by the ridiculous number of sub-plots, most of which are rushed or incomplete, and the relentless pace at which the film moves from one to the other. The film would have been so much better if it had stuck to a simpler storyline, and developed the characters and themes within that.The frenzied sequence of largely unrelated action set-pieces, whilst initially breathtaking, ended up feeling dull and predictable. What was lacking in between the explosions was anything resembling meaningful dialogue. A few mumbled words from Batman and some inane musings from the Joker weren't enough to keep the film going.As such, I left the film feeling somewhat exhausted at the bleak, joyless, violent world I had witnessed, and disappointed that this much-hyped film just hadn't been as good as I was hoping it would be.",6.0,Anonymous,0.0005,0.9995,-0.999,"Action, Crime, Drama"

"The best epic Science Fiction/Action film, The Dark Knight is Nolan's masterpiece.","The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed, produced, and co-written by Christopher Nolan. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the second part of Nolan's Batman film series and a sequel to 2005's Batman Begins, starring Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gylenhaal and Morgan Freeman.The dark Knight (2008) is the best epic Science Fiction/Action Batman film today. A truly great Christopher Nolan's masterpiece, straight from the comic books.The film lives up to Batman and Batman Forever.Capturing scarecrow was awesome. The Fight sequences were so much better than in Batman Begins. This film has a Heart and everything that stands for this film. The Dark Knight is actually a symbol for hope. Batman doesn't kill people in here, that isn't for what Batman stands for. He only scares people that is it.When you watch The Dark Knight you have to put your brain in to it, to understand the movie and that is what I did.I love The Dark Knight in the Tomb bat mobile when blow something he wrote only scare so he does not kill people. Best Batman Line: ""I'm not wearing hockey pads!"" Terrific cast and awesome directors. Is the Batman movie I ever wanted! This film makes correct mistake that Batman Forever failed.The Dark Knight is a reboot of Batman Forever. It fix Batman Forever were that movie failed. Were Joel Schumacher failed with his Batman movies.I Still can't believe Batman Forever won 3.Oscars while The Dark Knight won only 2.Oscars ugh.But The Dark Knight and Batman Begins are the best movies made by comic books. The Dark Knight is much better because there is more Batman in it. By day he is Bruce Wayne by night he is Batman. There are more fighting sequences flying sequences he was in Hong Kong really fantastic. Joker was portrayed by Heath Ledger really awesome. Bruce Wayne was on his wonderful bike and then he was in his beautiful car. The Dark Knight beats the hell out of Batman Forever. The Dark Knight starts, they finally shows that Batman did catch Crane it was wonderful when he jumped on the van and he took Scarecrow's mask off. Crane did come back for 5.minutes but he was still awesome. Now after Batman won and he beat Ra's Al Ghul by trying to destroy Gotham City and stopping crime boss Falcone, this time in The Dark Knight, Batman must take on the Joker and the mob who hired Joker to kill the Batman. Batman Forever was Schumacher fiction the only thing Schumacher did right, was scene were Maroni scared Harvey Dent in the court room, that was the only right scene. It fix Batman Forever I forgot to mentioned they change the car in Batman Forever in The Dark Knight they destroyed the tomb but they change into a bike vehicle and Batman driving trough the mall with a bike was a fantastic Action sequence! Also Nolan's inspiration for the film was the Joker's comic book debut The Killing Joke, and the series The Long Halloween, which retold Two-Face's origin. The nickname ""the Dark Knight"" was first applied to Batman in Batman #1 (1940), in a story written by Bill Finger.It was Heath Ledger's brilliant performance as The Joker that made The Dark Knight a masterpiece. Heath Ledger's acting the Joker was believable, he was absolutely ,awesomely, amazing ,brilliant and fantastic. I never saw anyone or any actor playing a character like that, like Heath did. Not only Heath Ledger was in his best performance also Aaron Eckhart correct and performed Harvey Dent/Two-Face better than Tommy Lee Jones did in Batman Forever, Action stunts were wonderful, Maggie Gyllenhaal was absolutely fantastic as Rachel Dawes better than Katie Holmes was. Maggie did also much wonderful better performance than Katie Holmes did in Batman Begins. I am glad they cast Maggie in it, instead of shallow stupid dumb Katie Holmes.Aaron Eckhart was awesome great fantastic as Harvey Dent he was portrayed by comic books. Tommy Lee Jones in Batman Forever (1995) was purple, his design was half black, half purple, he wasn't portrayed right. Hollywood wanted that sequel to Batman Returns ugh.Harvey Dent wasn't a sidekick to Riddler he didn't even met him or become his partner, he didn't had two women's beside him. He was alone and he went on a revenge killing spree for Rachel Dawson 's death. Harvey Dents says We Kill the Bat or was the Riddler in this film is saying the Joker this lines. Gary Oldman was fantastic as Detective Jim Gordon. Whole cast in the film was wonderful and absolutely fantastic. It is really tragic that Heath Ledger that year died before the premiere. I heard a lot about fans crying over the﻿ actor's death that year. Finally Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman was good in his role which I like him much better in here than I did in Batman Begins.The film was released on 14 July 2008 (New York City, New York (premiere) in USA. The film also Features 37 minutes of IMAX footage, which Christopher Nolan used IMAX 70 mm film cameras to film some sequences, including the Joker's first appearance in the film. CGI and special Effects are also awesome and aren't bad. Costume designer Lindy Hemming was awesome as she worked on the Batman, Harvey Dent and Joker costumes.The Dark Knight is the best Batman Epic Science Fiction Action film ever!

Wow - Mind Blowing Action,"The Dark Knight was probably the best action film I've ever seen. Not only is the design, tone, special FX, sound, and music all were excellent; but the script was dense, complex, and thorough. The performances from the actors were all very good, particularly Ledger, who took the Joker into a realm of sociopath that we've not seen in a batman character before. This may be Ledger's best performance from his all too short career.The only issue I have is the extreme grossness and goriness of the Two-Face make up/special FX. I think it goes a bit too far to have little bits of flesh dangling from his visible bone structure (The only thing I believe that was better from the previous Bat Mans series). But, the director doesn't use too much ""face time"" on that character, so the look remains shocking and not overdone.Certainly The Dark Knight will stand out for quite some time as the best comic book movie, as it has that as its roots. However, it may also stand as a masterpiece in its own right.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Great Heath Ledger steals the show...,"The highlight of this film is one man and one man only...the Late Heath Ledger...his Oscar-worthy performance marks the best work in his short lifetime...and not only him, but Christopher Nolan should also be commended in the way in which he developed the atmosphere of the film; the camera-work was excellent, the pace was gripping, the plot was thrilling and the acting was splendid. Background music also suited the atmosphere to the highest degree.All in all, a perfect film and magnificent acting...the film should have been named after the joker...Batman himself was not needed....such a Batman film will never again be produced, due to the unfortunate absence of Heath Ledger.10/10 rating...well done",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Mind Blowing,"I am not a huge fan of sequels and it is hard to write a review about what I see as one of the most perfect movies I have had the privilege to see.The Nolan brothers have done a brilliant job with this sequel to the critically acclaimed Batman Begins of 2005.Heath Ledger as the Joker virtually steals the movie, add him to Christian Bale as Batman, Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent and Michael Caine as Alfred, then add the brilliant Morgan Freeman and the ever reliable Gary Oldman in their respective roles and you have an absolutely brilliant cast to work their magic.I am not as eloquent as many of the reviewers on this site who have gushed superlatives about this movie in 1000 words or less, but my short review will suffice for me to get across my opinion.If you have not already seen this movie after 9 years you have really missed out on one of the entertainment experiences of life that you could have very cheaply experienced by now.You owe it to yourself to get a copy of this somehow and see it.One of the easiest movies to rate 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"

If you only see one movie this summer yada yada yada...,"Remember those sayings that magazines or critics would say? One of the more popular ones was: ""If you only see one movie this summer, this is it"". Well, until now I never understood that too well, but now I really... really do. The Dark Knight is THAT movie. As plain as I can say it, The Dark Knight is by far the greatest, most entertaining movie released all year. Period.I had the privilege of seeing an advanced showing for management only in IMAX about a week before this movie released. I was ecstatic that not only was I seeing this much anticipated movie a week early, but it was my first IMAX experience. If you have the option, definitely go with IMAX, it was unbelievable really. It felt like you were flying thru Gotham City about to fall into another scheme by the Joker. But enough about IMAX, how about the movie? Well, Batman Begins received exemplary ratings from critics, about an 8 out of 10 on IMDb if I recall correctly as well. Since Batman Begins turned out so well and ended with Batman receiving word of the Joker, every fan was ready for this movie ASAP. Just a short, quick, 3 years later... we finally got The Dark Knight. The main attraction for this show was Heath Ledger's part after his sudden death. Some will be saying that this was one of his best performances, and I can agree strongly. The Joker was thrilling, yet comical. Heath brought out the dark villain even though he is, well, a joker. All his phrases and sayings made the movie what it was, but it still kept your mindset in fright mode; very hard to tackle.Looking back on every scene, noticing it was 2 hours and 30 some odd minutes, I can not find a scene unnecessary. Few movies bare the exception of being insanely long but not at all boring, and this one fit that perfectly. Very long, very detailed, but with patrons paying that IMAX ticket price, you want every minute you can get. I also could not find any flaws really with the movie, except for the casting of Maggie Gyllenhaal. Anyone but Katie Holmes wouldn't be good enough. I mean, Maggie is pretty, but not nearly as good looking as Katie Holmes; sort of ruined her character for me. She is very talented though, absolutely.So after all was said and done, this movie to me was just about perfect. 10 out of 10. Christopher Nolan absolutely took Batman to a new level and said 'forget the rest'. This is top notch... I want to watch it again.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Good? Yes. Great? Yea. Amazingly perfect in every possible way on an epic scale of perfection? No.,"I have the flame suit on. I've already called my lawyers. I've prepared fake passports and bought several different aliases to run by. I have also transferred my funds to a European account. Why so serious? Because, here we go, The Dark Knight is not the epic piece of Godly art that everyone is hyping it to be.*Runs*The Dark Knight is a good piece of work, a decent movie, but does not fall into near-perfection by any means. Despite the amazing performances, writing, and action sequences, the heart and core of the comic book flavor is severely missing. Issues from Batman Begins is carried over and repeated here, even though they aren't as easy to spot. This is much better than Begins, but still fails to totally erase the memory of Burton's vision of Batman. Resembling more The Godfather and Heat rather than a flick like Iron Man or Spider-Man, it's a totally different sort of movie involving superheroes and supervillians. Gotham City STILL doesn't truly look like Gotham City.Starting the movie is a bank robbery unlike any other, setting the tone of the movie instantly. We see the Joker (Heath Ledger) stirring some early trouble with the mob and crime lords. We then see Batman imitators lurking about. Last, but not least, we see Bruce Wayne's ex (Maggie Gyllenhaal) around the arms of another man: Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). Then running amok throughout the 150+ minutes of The Dark Knight are action sequences, plot twists, several surprises, several close calls, and a whole lot of crime drama. Good vs. Evil is a battle that is horrifically blurred, and human nature surrounding Gotham City is being tested. All the tension is overcoming Bruce Wayne and Batman, and he begins questioning his motives and placement within the city. The writing staff threw in plenty of deep and engaging dialogue amongst all the action we see on-screen. It's a Batman fan's dream come true; or is it?We can start by crediting Heath Ledger for a fine performance as the Joker. But if Ledger deserves an Oscar for his role, so should Nicholson back in 1989, because believe there are many similarities in terms of performance. The Joker here is cynical, merciless, and is bent on anarchy for no reasonbut so was Joker in 1989. If Ledger wins the Oscar, then Jack himself should be accepting it on his behalf. Christian Bale yet again fails as Batman with his frustrating raspy voice. As Bruce Wayne he nails it, but as Batman he still needs a bit of work. When Batman starts monologing, it's hard not to cringe. The rest of the cast does a good job, most notably Gary Oldman as Lt. Gordon. Let's also not forget Morgan Freedman, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart, and Maggie Gyllenhaal.The biggest strength of the Batman universe lies within the balance of Batman and his villains. Almost all of them have some sort of connection with our hero. However, the treatment of villains yet again is disappointing, as we see a few villains limited to mere cameos, and the Joker himself (despite the trailers) does not get as much screen time as you may assume. In the infamous 1989 version, we saw the Joker rise from lowly punk criminal to a serious threat to the entire city. In the Dark Knight, unlike Batman, there is literally no explanation as to why he is the way he is. There is no backstory revealed, nothing that could possibly explain his physical appearance and mental state. Surely he may craft some tales, but why believe a madman's tale as he wields a knife to your lips?Dark Knight's best moments were not the action sequences, but the immense tension and suspense predating the payoff .Rarely could you predict the outcomes of some of the conflicts, and for the most part all the payoffs were grand, sometimes leading to applause. The chases and action-packed moments themselves were also well-crafted and made great use of special effects. Yet with so many problems flying at you at the same time, it's impossible to expect them all to be concluded and wrapped up in the end. Nolan's direction is stunning from time to time, but then he runs out of steam towards the end of the third act, when the movie is almost finished. The ending, albeit unexpected, was a bit underwhelming and quite vague, especially considering the fact that The Dark Knight is 150 minutes long.Bottom Line: The negativity is sprinkled about in this review, but don't let that fool you. The Dark Knight is indeed a great blockbuster flick that will have you forgetting that there's popcorn and soda by your side. From the dazzling performance of the late Heath Ledger to the carefully-constructed action sequences that keep the pace flowing, there is plenty to praise about. That being said, it's still not the best superhero movie of all-time. Batman is a comic book, and the cast of this new franchise must remember this. You can dwell as much realism as you'd like, but the fact remains that this isn't a realistic franchise nor should it ever be treated as such.Gotham City is still missing its gritty, Gothic, dark architecture and style of Burton's films, and needs more emphasis on the villains that are in Batman's world. The villains are the ""yang"" to the Batman mythology, and Batman himself is the ""yin""; you can't have too much of one and not enough of the other. While it isn't Batman and Robin or Fantastic Four (both of them) The Dark Knight still falls short of masterpiece quality simply because of its exchange of comic book style for realistic crime drama. The Dark Knight is a great ride, but not an epic one to Quality Heaven.",8.0,Anonymous,0.9958,0.0042,0.9915,"Action, Crime, Drama"

"Entertaining, but not a masterpiece","Heath Ledger as the Joker is brilliant, and anytime he's on the screen this action film seems elevated. It also gets the nihilistic insanity of the character right, as Alfred (Michael Caine) so correctly puts it, ""Some men just want to watch the world burn."" I was less of a fan of Christian Bale's performance as Batman, with his toneless, gruff voice, and if I'm honest, even the concept of the Dark Knight, with Batman sans Robin viewed as an evil vigilante by the citizens of Gotham. I also thought the film tried to pack too much in, with the love interest/triangle (Maggie Gyllenhaal), rise of Two Face (Aaron Eckhart), and extraneous characters (e.g. Morgan Freeman). It could have also used a breather in between all the action scenes, though some of the elements, like that batpod with the extra fat tires, were pretty cool. It goes on way too long at 152 minutes, and if it had been pared down and more focused on the Joker's sadistic psychological cruelty, could have been a masterpiece. All in all it's a good, entertaining film, but not worthy of the extraordinary high praise and ratings it's received.",7.0,Anonymous,0.9988,0.0012,0.9977,"Action, Crime, Drama"

"Very well made, moody  and gripping with a brilliant Heath Ledger, if a tad bloated","I grew up on the animated series, loved the first two Batman films, sort of liked Batman Forever but disappointed in Batman and Robin. I have yet to re-watch Batman Begins, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film on re-watch having really liked it first time. It is very well made and gripping with some great performances, but personally I would put Casablanca, Wizard of Oz, Amadeus and It's a Wonderful Life over this.The film does suffer from being a little too talky, and the plot on occasions can be hard to follow due to a lot going on. Nevertheless it is extremely good, and not only one of the better Batman movies but also one of the better superhero movies. Visually and technically, the film cannot be faulted. The cinematography is superb and the spectacle of Gotham City is dazzling. Christopher Nolan's direction is taut, and ensures that the action is explosive.The plot is a little bloated, with the Joker bent on destroying organised crime for good and making Batman cross between hero and vigilante, and subplots about Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes, and Hong Kong. But there are some truly effective scenes that are tightly structured, and the screenplay in general while a little too talky in the first twenty minutes is intelligent and sophisticated. The Joker especially has some very sinister lines that stay with you for a long while afterwards.The music by none other than maestro Hans Zimmer, who also composed music for The Lion King, Gladiator and the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, is outstanding. Rousing, beautiful, haunting, it is definitely memorable and doesn't become forgettable or generic like the music in The Hurt Locker for example. And I have to say the sound engineering here is phenomenal, particularly on very high volume the explosions sound very authentic as if they are coming from outside rather than from in the film.And I have to mention the acting, as that was terrific. Christian Bale manages to be dark, brooding and charismatic like Batman should be. Though if I did have a complaint, he does speak in a very hoarse voice as if he's got a sore throat and I somehow did not know what to make of it. It wasn't irritating or anything, just...odd. Anyway, Aaron Eckhart is terrific as Harvey Dent/Two-Face even if his storyline was a tad too rushed, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is very sensitive and caring as Rachel. Morgan Freeman does well in a smaller role, as does the excellent Gary Oldman, and Michael Caine is perfect as the loyal butler Alfred.There is no doubt in my mind that Heath Ledger gave the best performance of the film. He wasn't just brilliant, he was phenomenal, unpredictable, insane, extremely sinister and corrupt not to mention chillingly psychotic. I am torn on who I prefer over Jack Nicolson or Heath Ledger; it is a very close call. I admit I am more familiar with Nicolson's portrayal and liked his mix of the scary and comical and even tragic Joker, but the Joker here in The Dark Knight is truly sinister and even more of a threat to Batman and in my opinion this Joker has lines that linger longer into the memory.Overall, not absolutely perfect but it is extremely good thanks to primarily Ledger's performance and the dazzling visual spectacle. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9979,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Why so serious?,"First of all, no I don't think this movie is bad. But I don't think it should be thought of as the gold standart for comic book movies. Because honestly, this movie doesn't feel like a comic book.This is a very good action movie, that dresses it's main protagonist and antagonist as comic book characters. And here I think lies the problem.This is a movie about a billionaire, dressed as a bat, who beats an anarchist clown. And Christopher Nolan tries to make this look serious. I'm sorry, it doesn't work. It just takes away the comic book feeling. And therefore it becomes a little boring. If Heath Ledger isn't on the screen I find myself hardly invested in what's happening.To be honest, I never really liked this movie that much. Maybe because I first watched when I was 8 and it felt boring. But I watched it a few times in later years and I still remember only pieces of fractions of what's happening, outside of scenes that have the Joker. And to be fair, I probably wouldn't have remembered those pieces, if I didn't watch reviews out of boredom.I went online to see if there is anybody who feels the same way and they all said the same thing: Heath Ledger single handedly saves this movie. And while his performance is spectacular, I can't think of him as a definitive Joker. He is good for this movie, but I'm not sure if I can see him fit in other Batman movies. And a personal bias of mine is that no one is ever going to top Mark Hamill. However, Ledger did his own thing and he did good. Unlike other main charachters in the movie, this one won people over. But it's still in a movie that plays everything too serious.It feels like Nolan took the main charachters from a comic book and put them in this, just because otherwise it would have been just another action movie. It lacks a certain element. It lacks that comic book campiness, that even the most serious comic books have a pinch of in them. And therefore it fails to deliver as a comic book movie.That's not to say that being serious is a bad change. Too many comic book are corny as hell and very often it gets annoying. But if you get too serious, you get boring. One should not be at the expense of the other. One must find a balance between the comic book campiness and the seriousness of the real world.To quote a certain character: Why so serious?",7.0,Anonymous,0.997,0.003,0.994,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Distinctly average and surprisingly rather dull,"It is odd to spend more than two hours watching a film and it slowly dawns on you that you are not particularly bothered how it ends and, if anything, rather wish it would end sooner rather than later. The Dark Knight is that kind of film. Exactly why I lost interest or even when, I'm not too sure, but lose interest I did. This is Christopher Nolan's second stab at Batman as well as Christian 'Rant' Bales, and although all the elements are there, it is simply not as good. Naturally, this being another slug, blast and punchfest - tho' despite it's reputation for being dark, thankfully not a bloodfest - many, many viewers have lauded this as a 'masterpiece', 'the best movie of 2008 so far', 'far surpasses Begins'. No, it isn't and no it doesn't. All I can say is that these people have not seen many 'masterpieces' or many films in 2008. The Dark Knight, in that way which Hollywood has made its sugary own, attempts to flatter the audience by including a 'moral dilemma' and it does so not once, but rather often. This time we are invited - the 'we' being the popcorn-chewing Saturday night crowd who think thought is a luxury - to reflect on moral ambiguity and how relative rather than absolute the notions of good and evil can be. And each time this viewer sighed a little: as the saying goes, you can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig. We get any number of high falutin speeches about heroes and villains but, in truth, is just so much codswallop. In truth this film is just another blockbuster, and, at that, it is not even as good as many other blockbusters. If you want to meditate on the reality of good and evil, of heroes and villains, by all means make a film doing so, but in The Dark Knight it is all, for this viewer at least, all very phoney. Apart from that, this film is a tad confusing, there are too many characters, the plot, or at least what there is of it, really does not bear repeating, the suspense is curiously unexciting, and too often the film drags. The old actors are there, and all with the very honourable exception of the late Heath Ledger, seem to be acting by numbers. (This was, I think, Ledger's last film, and his early death is sad. Undoubtedly he was very talented.) And having said all that, there is not much more to say. It's not bad, it's not particularly good. As part of the series, it stands tall, but then the series is not all that outstanding. See it if you want to, and if, after reading this, you decide not to, well, sorry, but you won't be missing much at all.",5.0,Anonymous,0.0019,0.9981,-0.9962,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Mainstream art,"When I watched the dark knight for the first time, I was about 16 and I had mixed feelings towards it, I used to consider it to be a decent film not great as at that time I was just an average movigoer. Then after two years I gave it a rewatch with full enthusiasm after 'watching and having few knowledge' about some critically acclaimed films like ""the departed"", "" Inception "" and ""Saving Private Ryan"". After my second viewing I found it to be one of the best films ever made and the best in its genre .It was a game changer for my taste in films. It still tops the superhero genre even after 14 years of it's release. The only superhero/comic book film which comes close to this one is ""Logan"" in my opinion. So after all I consider the dark knight to be a phenomenal film even without Heath Ledger's outstanding performance. The main reason for the artistic appearance of the film is because of it's exploration towards many themes like human nature, dark reality of society, nature of lies, true and false characteristics and many more. Considering other parameters like cinematography, background score and screenplay, I highly appreciate all of this especially the background score which I consider to be the best among all Nolan's films.

The Dark Truth,"What is going on with all of these maximum ratings for a barely average film? According to IMDb, this is the best film of the decade so far. Not one sane person could argue that this is justified. Have the studios finally managed to get the masses to 'believe the hype'? I was a bit skeptical about this film, due to the hype, and especially because I wasn't impressed with Batman Begins, but I must admit, the heist in the first five minutes was excellent, and I thought my skepticism was unwarranted. But then Batman turned up and began speaking like a wrestler with throat cancer, and it continued to go down hill from there. What I didn't expect this film to be was tedious. But it was. It was far too long and bored my pants off me. There was no character development, the story was convoluted and over-complex and it was far too long. But my my main problem, and this goes against nearly every reviewer here, even those who weren't impressed, I thought Heath Ledger was absolutely awful! Who are these people calling for a posthumous Oscar? There is nothing I despise more than a 'look at me' performance. Ledger did all the tricks required to portray a 'crazy guy', including shifting his eyes up, down, left and right at every opportunity, and ingeniously, due to having his mouth cut as a child, he keeps licking around the inside of his mouth, which rather than being an impressive feat of method acting is actually as irritating as watching a fat man eat chips with his mouth open. His performance was utterly self-indulgent and it seems like all you sycophants fell for it. The only decent acting performance in this film is Eckhart. Caine and Morgan bore, and Bale, with his 'employ me for movie trailers' voice barely has one dimension. I would have rated this film higher if it hadn't taken itself so seriously, but as it stands it is a pretentious hyped-up and tedious movie.

Wonderful.

It's also a study of character, of good and of ""dark"" and of perception of ""society."" I mean, it does this so well I sometimes think the superhero content is just a scapegoat for the deeper thought in the movie even though I know at the same that it's not.Secondly, Batman doesn't do anything too unbelievable. Look at Superman, he's flying. Look at Spiderman, he's got webs coming out of his palms. Look at the Hulk he can get MASSIVE when he is angry. That's all cool and entertaining, but Batman is, imo, the superhero whom we can connect to the closest, because he doesn't have these ""abilities"" about him which are soooo unrealistic.So, both his inner and outer character are human like which makes the movie so much more enjoyable.The action? The action in Dark Knight is amazing! Batman's car is amazing! The special effects are amazing! It is a phenomenal piece of work crafting a movie where it looks and feels fantastic!I won't talk much about Heath Ledger's portrayal of the joker. It's definitely his best performance ever, and what better time to have it just before his death, peace be upon him. I hate a ball watching the guy act. He's just created an insanely unique persona. I loved it!Everything in Dark Knight works. It's got so much novelty to it. It's a rare piece of cinema where prima facie it's for kids, but ultimately, adults will end up enjoying it much more. Dark Knight isn't for kids anyway, they wont be able to comprehend the bigger picture in Dark Knight, which is what makes this movie so special.It's cool It's original It's awesomeI can't believe how it wasn't nominated for a Best Picture. Oscars were probably too stunned at how good a super hero movie could be. Did I mention I also love Gary Oldman, the guy plays a different person in every movie, I can never tell its him",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Sometimes the Truth is not Good Enough,"Batman (Christian Bale) joins force with Lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the incorruptible District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who is his rival in the love for Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), to fight the organized crime in Gothan City. However, chaos is installed in the city with the arrival of the sadistic psychopath The Joker (Heath Ledger) that brings a wave of violence and murders. The Joker promises to kill prominent citizens of Gothan City unless Batman discloses his identity, and tries to prove the malice and darkness of the human nature and destroy the hope of the dwellers of Gothan City.""The Dark Knight"" is a great surprise for a blockbuster, with a solid and deep story, great direction, performances, special effects and make-up. The adventure is also dramatic, with magnificent lines and discussions about ethics, morality, human nature, hope and other important themes. The cast has great performances and Heath Ledger is excellent in the role of the psychopath The Joker, and using the movement of lips and tongue visibly inspired in T-Bag, from ""Prison Break"", and brilliantly performed by Robert Knepper. But his nomination is emotionally affected by his death. In the end, ""The Dark Knight"" is a great movie, the best of the Batman franchise and one of the best of the genre in 2008, but the IMDb User Rating (Top 250: #4) is absolutely overrated, ridiculous and disrespectful with the classics of the cinema history and the credibility of IMDb's Rating; but ""sometimes the truth is not good enough"".

Bringing this conversation back down to earth,"Writing this review at the tail end of opening weekend, the Dark Knight has broken the record for opening weekend and deservedly so... this film is a step-above the standard summer blockbuster. However, the film also sits atop IMDb's top 250 films of all-time list, a ranking that won't last nearly as long as its box-office rank. Lines have been long to see this film, and many of those who are voting on this opening weekend are die-hards who waited in line and were ready to love this film regardless of what it offered. Of course, the fact that this film stands alone in its genre in terms of writing, cinematography, art design, and plot helps boost its ratings into the stratosphere, but when the non die-hards begin to watch and vote, we'll see this film settle into its rightful place, somewhere in the top 25 of all time. Its one of those few films that is entertaining and accessible enough to please the same people who went out in droves for Spiderman 3, while artistic and smart enough to please the more discerning cinematic audiences. Truly disturbing, the characters were far from cliché, as one would expect from the genre. No character is all-good or all-bad. Ledger's Joker comes close, but earns a touch of sympathy. None of the heroes are flawless, which is a sign of any good film. My single complaint (besides the various hard-to-believe falls Batman survives) is the rating. This film is far-too disturbing to garner a PG13 rating, and deals with the ugliest sides of humanity in a way that should probably be accompanied by a good conversation that can add some perspective... yet another reason why this film is so good.",8.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"
The Most Overrated film I've ever seen!,"When I went to the cinema to see Indiana Jones 4 I remember seeing a trailer for 'The Dark Knight'. It was dark, full of explosions and looked really cool. Being a huge fan of Batman and the two Burton films I couldn't wait to see it. While I never saw it in cinemas, I remember my friends telling me it was amazing and one of the best films ever. Fast forward to when I finally got to see the film and it was a different story.Two and a half hours of the most pretentious, boring and disappointing film I had ever seen. Lets start with the plot(s). Basically, the Joker (atleast that's what they call him) starts killing people and causing mayhem, meaning Batman has to stop him. Sounds simple but the film spoils this by having too many plot lines, most of which have nothing to do with the actual plot, don't last long enough to be interesting and could have been easily cut out to make a shorter and easier to follow plot.Now for the hero and villain. Batman is played by Christian Bale and comes complete with an over the top gruff voice, which sounds like he smoked a entire packet of cigarettes while doing a cross country marathon. He's nowhere near as dark or as intimidating as Keaton's Batman and isn't very engaging as Bruce either. Now for the reason the film is considered to be so great, Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger is the main driving point of the film and the most interesting character. He plays the role very convincingly and I'll admit is the best part of the film, even though they could have called him anything else instead of 'the Joker' and it would have been the same.And that's my biggest problem with this film, it doesn't feel like a Batman film. Batman has always been a surreal franchise, meaning it walks on a line between the real world and a fantasy world. Why does Gotham City just look like and regular city? Why does the Joker not have any comical death contraptions? Why does the Batmobile look like a tank? Where are all Batman's unique gadgets? The problem is Nolan doesn't understand that a man who dresses up as a Bat and fight crime can't be taken completely seriously. Burton made a surreal world for Batman and Batman Returns, creating a perfect environment for his films. But with Nolan, all I think of is just a crime drama with Batman in it. The Joker could have been just a psycho with makeup.The pacing is also a flaw. Sometimes the film moves too quickly for us to digest what's going on and other time it goes to slow that we lose interest. Only reason people loved it was for Heath Ledger's amazing performance and his unfortunate passing away before the film's release, and even that doesn't fit the bill for a 'Batman' movie. To sum up, 'The Dark Knight' will go down in history as the most overrated film ever made.",6.0,Anonymous,0.0005,0.9995,-0.999,"Action, Crime, Drama"
This Movie Can Only Be Described With One Word.,"And that word is Awefantaculous. I use that word because words like ""awesome"" and ""fantastic"" are thrown around way too much. This movie deserves better. Almost everything about it was perfect. I will try to give away as little about the plot as possible, because to take away anything from this experience would be disastrous. Let me just say that I was not in the least disappointed with the plot, it delivered in as many ways as seemingly possible. It improves on Begins in almost every way. What you have seen in the trailers doesn't compare to what the movie delivers. heard complaints about the run time, but that was absolutely no problem for me. Every minute of the movie was great, and I didn't think any of it was unnecessary at all. In fact the only real problem I had with the movie was the dread of knowing that the movie had to end some time. The movie was the perfect mix of the human side and the action side. It goes so much deeper than the battle against good and evil.The acting was at the top of the ranks. Christian Bale has once again proved that he is made for the role of Batman and Bruce Wayne. Maggie Gyllenhaal served as a great replacement for Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine both played their roles just as good as before, which is all anyone can really ask, is it not? I think Gary Oldman was even better as Gordan than he was in Batman Begins. Harvey Dent was played really well by Aaron Eckhart, as well. But I guess in the end what people want to know is about is how the late Heath Ledger played the Joker, easily my favourite Batman villain, and maybe my favourite villain of all. Well, he was perfect. I feel that the role will go down in history as one of the greatest villainous portrayals of all time. Give him the Academy Award and any other awards that he could possibly qualify for. Hell, invent a new category just for him. He was The Joker. May he rest in peace.I loved the way the film was shot, whether it was the hotel scenes, the scenes of Gotham City and especially the action scenes in the movie, which I felt was another improvement made on Batman Begins. I guess you could say it was a lot more fun, since a common complaint about Begins was the lack of that. I thought the blue colour scheme of Gotham was really great. The movie also had some great wit throughout it, which rarely seemed cheesy or out of place. The score was really something as well. It is probably one of my favourite ones around. One of the best things about the film, for me, was just how dark the movie was. If Batman Begins pushed Batman and Robin to the back of your mind, then The Dark Knight will be the movie that pushes it out. The film was made to really let The Joker be what he was truly meant to be, without restraint. I am amazed that it got away with the PG-13 rating (even though I'm an Aussie, and don't have that rating system). The costumes and make-up in the movie were, big surprise, just great. I thought The Joker's makeup was really cool, because it didn't just take the easy way out and make it perfect throughout the movie. They went into detail with it. Batman's new suit was also pretty cool.I guess in the end, all I can really say that I loved this movie, and I think it would be hard for someone to be disappointed with it. Christopher Nolan really came through big time, and made a massive improvement over the already great Batman Begins. This is clearly a franchise that fits him like a glove. It is suspenseful, emotional, action packed and really everything else I think people could hope for. A problem with the movie is that after seeing it, you may just be a little spoiled. Because it is at a level of awefantaculousness that is pretty rarely seen in movies. Believe the hype. This is way more than a Batman movie or a summer blockbuster, it is just incredible.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9979,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Joker is the only good part,"The movie is pretty boring and bad, however the joker scenes are amazing. If the whole movie was like his scenes, I would've given it 9 stars. However, sadly, the movie is depriving us of Joker because there are only like 5 scenes with him. Batman is pretty comedic in this movie. Which is not a good thing. He is always acting serious but his voice is just, how do I say this, cringe worthy. Batman sounds like one of those kids YouTubers that make videos of Batman and Elsa hooking up (yes those videos exist, please monitor what your kids are doing/watching online). The movie ends pretty abruptly, and left me confused. (I recommend watching Joker instead).",9.0,Anonymous,0.0005,0.9995,-0.9989,"Action, Crime, Drama"
all star cast all star results,"for weeks leading up to the film movie insiders have been claiming that not only is it the best batman movie but that heath ledger deserves a Oscar nod for his work as the joker here is my short take on the film sorry its 4am and i just got home. the film overall is about as good as its every going to get as a action film and as a film on its own i really do think as of what i have seen so far it deserves at least a Oscar nom for best film the acting alround is just top shelf stuff. i will say this the film felt abit long but it needed to be. OK on to the cast, batman from watching the trailers and stuff u expect the film to be all about the joker and i was worried that batman would be pushed into the back....this is not the case. the film overall doesn't follow one person it follows the story and i think thats what makes it such a good movie cause in the end the story is the important part. OK my one knock on the film heath ledgers joker was good but i didn't think it was Oscar good, i will say he holds his own with jack's joker....actually i think its better but i don't think is Oscar good. i liked the way they used him in the film he pops in does the damage and pops out and it really works best that way. now Aaron Eckhart's two face/dent makes tommy lee's a joke....but really aaron take on both dent and twoface were amazing the characters are taken to deep levels and it really gave the film a extra kick and props to the special effects guys it looked so real. bale i think carries the story well just like in begins while i do think ledger and eckhart take some thunder away from him the movie over all turns out better for it, and its not like he doesn't have his moments ether. Gyllenhaal replaces homes and honestly i would have rather homes im not saying she did a bad job i just think with home's work on thank you for smoking she would have been a better choice if they could of had her. or wanted her? finally the supports of freeman caine and oldmen work just as well as they did in the past and special note to chin han also made good use of his screen time overall its easy to say this is by far the best of the batman movies. if i had to compare it to anything its like saying batman begins is like a star war iv and D.K is like EP:v both are good but this one just takes it that next level up",9.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9979,"Action, Crime, Drama"

A Modern Masterpiece,"A modern masterpiece of 21st Century Cinema. The Dark Knight combines great direction, with brilliant acting, and beautiful cinematography to create a film that transcends it genres and becomes a great film. This will remain a perfect example of why film is still worth shooting in, why practical effects should not be a thing of the past, and why the Oscars should pay attention to comic book films as they can be art in their own right. It serves as a comic book film, but also a tragedy of Shakespearean quality, with one of the best villains of the last 20 years. On top of that Christopher Nolan's unflinching faith in practical effects creates a truly realistic and beautiful experience.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"
I never get tired of revisiting it,"I know it sounds a bit too cliché when someone says this, but this is undoubtedly one of, if not the best superhero movie ever created! It excels in every field it touches - The visual effects are done perfectly, the acting is absolutely Oscar worthy, the multiple storylines that don't seem too complex in spite of being told at the same time and in spite of being just one movie of a trilogy it managed to win the hearts of everyone who saw it.The story picks up very well from where Batman Begins ended. The post credit scene in that movie had shown Joker, and I can very well imagine how excited the audience must have been seeing it. The Batman and Joker duo is used to describe the social aspects of the society, and explain how people might behave if they are left unhinged. A hero who has his moral codes and a lot to lose, compared to a villain without any moral codes and nothing to lose yet have so much in common than what meets the normal eye. Ultimately both are seen as freaks who must be eliminated by the law.Let's talk about the characters, starting from Christian Bale's Batman. His voice sounds horrible as Batman. Nowadays many people have begun criticising it, but they don't realise that if a real Batman has to change his voice, he only has two ways of doing it - either using a voice modulator like Ben Affleck's Batman does, or deal with trying to sound different, which isn't easy when he has to breathe heavily because of how hard he works. It's just fun to see the caped crusader doing something on the screen.Next let's address Michael Caine's Alfred. He's a good representation of Alfred. Just by looking at him you get the feeling of both a butler and a guardian, something we know Alfred to be. And it can be seen very nicely when he dresses Bruce's wounds or talks to him about his crimefighting.Then we have Aaron Eckhart's Two Face. Unlike the previous iteration that was seen in Batman Forever, this one seems a lot more serious. He went through a hefty character development, from the patriotic white Knight of Gotham, Harvey Dent, to the deranged psychopath who is ready to cross all limits if he wants to have his revenge.Jim Gordon is also a much, much better iteration from what we had seen in the 1989 Batman. He actually looks like someone who is invested in his job and can contact Batman whenever he needs help. He is the kind of Gordon I imagine when I think of the animated movies. When someone mentions Jim Gordon, this is the one who comes to my mind.And finally the elephant in the room, the show stealer - Heath Ledger's Joker. Just like Two Face, Joker here has also gone through a complete makeover from what he was portrayed as in the previous movie that came in 1989. It's kinda sad that Heath Ledger never got to know how famous he has become, but his legacy shall forever live in the DC universe.The Dark Knight is one movie I often come back to just to remember these kinds of superhero movies are also possible. Every DC character should be given such movies where their character is shown to develop as time moves on. This fire should not die out.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Very disappointed,"The film was very disappointing. Firstly Heath Ledger, wow didn't see that coming. He was terrific. From A knights tale to the dark knight...... not the same actor surely. The tongue flicks and glaring at the camera were very real indeed. I am going to compare this to the 1989 film because in recent times that is the best comparison we can make. The 89 film was entertaining, this wasn't. It was too dark, too dreary and left me feeling a bit depressed which just isn't the aim of comics. Christian Bale's voice as Batman was ridiculous, I didn't have any empathy with his character at all, didn't feel for him.... just nothing. Thought that I wouldn't want to live in Gotham as it was so dreary and felt that Commissioner Gordon was just too earnest. Chris Nolan gave us the excellent Memento and I think another good film in Insomnia. Though I appreciate the lack of CGI (very refreshing) and the last half an hour of the film, i fidgeted throughout and by the end felt I could have left early. Last year the Bourne Ultimatum rattled along and I came out of the cinema entertained. This was just depressing.

About as Perfect as a Batman Film Could Ever Be,"After defeating the Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy), Batman and Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) have little time to return to normal life. The mafia is growing, and there's a new menace prowling the streets: The Joker (Heath Ledger, in his last performance). Can the Batman handle a villain who has no morals, no goals, no methods and is completely unpredictable? Also, a love triangle forms between Wayne, Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart).There's little use in writing a review of ""The Dark Knight"" -- the critics loved it, fans love it, the sales are going through the roof and are likely to pass every record ever set. And I loved it, too, making it easily the film of the year and both an action-packed thriller as well as a bit of a tear-jerker. Heck, even small amounts of comic relief were thrown in (especially if you like dark humor).I could make complaints: the spinning camera shots were overdone. The Batman voice -- digitally altered for no good reason -- was excessively gruff. The ""Bat-Sonar"" was far-fetched, cheesy and pointless. And bullet reconstruction to get a fingerprint? Doubtful. And the Wayne-Batman character was largely flat and uninteresting, encouraging fans to root for the Joker. So, there was room for perfection (which is why this film, as great as it is, cannot receive a perfect score).Concerns aside, the film was well done, as Christopher Nolan and Bale work well together (see ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Prestige""). The action is intense, the violence superb for a PG-13 film. There's some suspense, plot twists, unexpected deaths. The romance aspect is a bit unclear (when does this film take place -- Rachel seems to have found a fiancé fairly fast). And Heath Ledger, oh my.The hype around this fill was very Ledger-centric, declaring him as Oscar-worthy. I thought this was exaggerated due to his untimely demise and was therefore disrespectful. However, the praise was well-deserved. This was the Joker, inside and out. I couldn't even visually Ledger under the makeup. I'll always love Jack Nicholson's portrayal, but Ledger brings his ""A"" game. If he is nominated, I accept it; and if he wins, that seems reasonable to me. Best performance so far this year, in any genre.As I said in the beginning, my review is pretty much just more or what you've already heard. The rumors are true, but judging by the sales of the picture, you've already seen it and know first-hand. If you haven't, see it in the theater while you can. Or rent it. Not sure if it's a movie worth owning (I can't see myself watching it repeatedly, depending on the special features). But this may be the superhero movie that defines the genre.",9.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9977,"Action, Crime, Drama"
good but overrated,"Normally I would give this a 7.5 out of 10 but since I cant' I'll give it a seven. How anyone could rate this title that high on IMDb.com is amazing to me. It's mostly fanboys that believe this is the best movie ever and the best thing since sliced bread but what most fanboys fail to notice because they lack objectivity is that while the movie is a good one, it is quite flawed and nowhere near as perfect as many of the fanboys have rated.A couple things I noticed when I watch this movie, the movie goes on way too long. Even my friends agreed and they are huge Batman fans. There are about 3 or 4 points in the movie where it seems like it will end but goes on for another 30 minutes. And while Heath Ledger's performance is top notch and Bale as Bruce Wayne is pulled of quite flawlessly, his Batman persona is a bit weak. The voice is annoying, and many times throughout the movie, he seemingly plays second fiddle.I can't know Eckhart's casting as Two Face but Maggie Gyllenhall just doesn't seem to fit and just seems to be a standalone piece of eye candy.There are many things I can harp about but I'm not here to knock the movie. There are good points, cinematography great, Joker and Two Face played excellently by their counterparts, mood was effective and story flowed quite well albeit a bit too long.BUT this movie doesn't even belong in mention to some of the greats and shame on many movie fans that had this movie rated higher than such classics as The Godfather.

"Very Good, But Yikes, Let's Keep Things in Perspective","Whatever else it may be, ""The Dark Knight,"" Christopher Nolan's follow up to his ""Batman Begins,"" the film that resurrected the Batman franchise, is the most ambitious superhero film ever made. It's full of brooding ruminations about the inherent nature of humanity, obviously fueled by the troubled state of a post-9/11 world, and it packs an awful lot of plot into its two-and-a-half-hour running time. However, be cautioned, and don't let its #1 rating at IMDb set up expectations that the film can't possibly meet. I doubt any experienced film goer is truly going to think that this is the best film ever made.The praise heaped on Heath Ledger for his performance as the Joker is well deserved. Indeed, the Joker becomes the focus of this movie, which may not be such a desirable thing, given that this is...you know....a Batman movie. The caped crusader fades into the background in this installment, to the point where you might leave the movie and forget that he was in it. Ditto Maggie Gyllenhaal, who plays the love interest, and who, true to the superhero movie formula, gets practically nothing to do. But Ledger you WILL remember. He creates a fascinating character in the Joker, and it's through him that the movie poses all of its major moral questions. Is it human nature, as the Joker suggests, to devolve into chaos when the illusion of order is taken away; or do humans have an inherent kindness that will cause them to look out for one another even when circumstances seem to call for self preservation? One of the most fascinating things about Ledger's creation is that the Joker has no more motive as a criminal than to pose questions like this. He's not out for money or even power -- he just wants to create anarchy and see what happens.I was not prepared for the other villain the screenplay throws into the mix: Two Face, played well by Aaron Eckhart. The film is too long, and it's this storyline that makes it so. Chrisotpher Nolan and his brother, Jonathan, the co-writers of the film, would have done well to leave this plot line out. By the end of the film, there are too many characters doing too many things independently of one another, so that the film loses focus slightly.The movie looks fantastic though, and the production team does wonders with Chicago (where I live by the way). In fact the look of the film is one of its major selling points, and I was pleased to finally see a superhero film that looks cinematic rather than cartoonish.So...an excellent addition to the superhero genre and a completely entertaining experience....but it's still, after all, a Batman movie, and it's not the best film since ""Citizen Kane.""Grade: A",8.0,Anonymous,0.9988,0.0012,0.9977,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Heath Ledger makes you forget Jack ever played Joker!,"This is the first movie sense The Lord of the Rings movies that had mad, crazy, super hype and surpassed it. I thought it was getting hyped up for the wrong reasons (the tragedy). I had my doubts going into this film because everyone was talking about the Ledger. After seeing so many previews, after seeing the film and knowing what other films the actor was in, he NAILED the Joker.I was happy that the film had more to offer than the preview had shown. It had some unexpected moments (which was good) and everyone one, and I do mean, everyone to include the bit players were wonderful in this movie. Nolan commanded and got some of the best work out of these people. Christian Bale just cemented that he is either better but no less than at the same level as Keaton's Batman and in the way, director Nolan film is better because it's more raw than Tim Burton's Batman. It doesn't seem like some faraway city. Kudos also goes to the City of Chicago for allowing Nolan to do whatever he wanted, so we have a lot less blue screen (cgi) effects and more realistic action sequences.But the man of the hour, is Heath Ledger. Like in so many movies where the villain steals the movie, this is no exception. You can see and sense the insanity in Ledger's Joker. I mean Jack Nicholson played Jack in the first Batman, but who would have expected this demented performance out of Ledger. And it was a great performance without the over the top, maniacal campiness that actors tend to do when playing villains.Now the only thing I wasn't crazy about was Batman's voice, it sounded a bit fake and it was hard to hear at times because it was so low. But that didn't take ANYTHING at all, away from the movie. This is a must to see on the big screen. I think its a must to see on the big screen twice and it's a must purchase on blu-ray when it's release. The movie runs about 2 hours and 45 minutes so be sure to take your bathroom break before the film start because you will not want to miss a minute.Director/Writer Christopher Nolan has that special film makers touch. He screwed with out Heads with Memento. He dazzled us with The Presitge (another movie with Bale in it). He reinvigorated us with Batman Begins and now he stuns us with the well-crafted ""Dark Knight"". We all seen what could happen to a franchise in the hands of a lesser director (Batman Returns, Batman and Robin) and its nice to see something that takes your breath away. The Dark Knight will win lots of awards, but I think it already won the biggest, audience approval. Thumbs up for the Dark Knight.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9979,"Action, Crime, Drama"
"for me,it doesn't  even touch Batman Begins","i loved the previous Batman film,Batman Begins.i thought it was brilliant,possibly the best superhero movie ever made.and with stratospheric hype this newest film had,combined with the trailers i had seen,i knew i had to see it.many people commented that it more than lived up to the hype,so i expected something earth shattering.to say i was disappointed is an understatement.there were moments where i was bored,and hoped it would end soon.Batman's voice in this movie annoyed me.it sounded like he had swallowed a bucket of gravel.either that,or had a bad case of laryngitis.maybe there was a reason behind this.but all it did was annoy me.as for Heath Ledger,and his performance as The Joker,i found it OK,but i wouldn't say it was award worthy.i mean no disrespect by this.when the movie finally ended and i left the theatre,neither the the character of The Joker,or any aspect of the movie stayed with me.bottom line,i didn't find anything profound in this movie.i was massively disappointed.it doesn't even touch Batman Begins,in my opinion.for me,The Dark Knight is a 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,0.0005,0.9995,-0.999,"Action, Crime, Drama"
A-maz-ing,"I have enjoyed batman for a long time and despite my rabid fanaticism this movie took me to a whole new level. This is barely a superhero movie; it's utterly devoted from start to finish as an action-drama and could stand alone by all means. I admit I was skeptical of what it would be like, what with the list of villains potentially bogging down the story, the change of actress for the character Rachel Dawes and of course Heath Ledger's death which I feared might make the movie a target for his fans to run wild. However I have never been so overjoyed to be so wrong; Maggie Gylennhal is a wonderful actress as Katie Holmes' replacement; her character was good enough to avoid the melodramatic angle and was rather sublime about any of the relationships, none of the villains took away from the movie or cluttered it in the least, and Heath Ledger was absolutely fantastic as the clown prince of crime; he deserves all the praise he gets for his performance which was scary and funny at the same time. Not once did it seem that the actor was tooting his own thespian horn (as I think jack Nicholson did when he played the joker) in fact I got the feeling Ledger was determined to have fun with it and I hope he did because he made a wonderful last impression with this skeptic. You don't have to be a fan to recognize what a thrill ride this movie is; my only warning to you is that you are not in for a mindless bubble-gum superhero flick that is short and simple; this is quality cinema and batman has never had so much solid footing in this area.

Does What it Set Out To Do,"Frank Miller's The Dark Knight was one of the greatest comic series ever made. I was a young comic book collector when it first came out and I remember buying 5 copies a couple of days after its release and then watching it sell out in a few weeks. The price for the first edition sky-rocketed after just a couple of months to over $100, as second and third runs were printed.What Miller did was nothing short of revolutionary. He depicted the Batman much the same way as the original 1930s Batman comics did - as a nearly maniacal, shadowy vigilante who sets forth to strike fear into the hearts of villains throughout Gotham. But he deepened the internal conflicts, the personal relationships, and the psychological aspects of the stories - especially the 2-3 episodes that dealt with the Joker. Miller's Joker was the flip-side of the Batman. An entirely sociopathic force for chaos and evil - and not entirely unlike the Batman at a deep structural level - driven by a similar kind of megalomania. The commonalities between the characters were just enough to shake Bruce Wayne to his core and to cause him to question everything he stood for.Take note - With Iron Man and this film, Comic Book Films Have finally begun to realize their full potential.Thankfully, The Dark Knight took aspects of Miller's version of the Joker and brought them to the screen faithfully - with adequate but not overbearing special effects, great acting talent, and a script worthy of Miller's work.The Joker, devastatingly played by Heath Ledger, is not the quirky Cesar Romero prankster, nor the slightly demonic Jack Nicholson Commodore of Crime, but rather Frank Miller's ingenious, amoral, homicidal maniac. And he is anything but funny. The Joker reigns terror down on Gotham through a series of increasingly murderous experiments designed to test his nihilistic hypothesis concerning human nature. The Batman is being hunted by a righteous new district attorney for his vigilante approach to justice, and it is becoming increasingly clear that crime has stepped up its skill and intelligence to meet him at his own level. Bruce Wayne, plagued by personal difficulties and the deep conflicts of his dual life considers hanging up his cloak just when Gotham needs him most. But something about the Joker gets way under his skin.The film even captures Miller's dark aesthetic of Gotham and the Batman consistently. Ledger is perfect, Bale is very good (though he was not given the depth afforded the Joker by the script, the story dictates that this will change in the next film), and the excellent, star-studded, supporting cast makes this blockbuster worth seeing by just about anybody.For those who know the story and bring great expectations to this film - you will be rewarded with catharsis. For those who don't - prepare to see something you would never expect from a comic book based film - intense psychological drama and powerfully realized characterization.For those who are just looking for a fun and entertaining action film - you will get more than you bargained for in The Dark Knight, but may find it too lengthy and dark for your tastes.",9.0,Anonymous,0.9988,0.0012,0.9977,"Action, Crime, Drama"

The film that seems to have fooled everyone!,"OK, lets get it out of the way, I'm a massive Batman fan. I loved the TV show when I was a kid, really enjoyed the early Tim Burton films and have even worn the costume on a few occasions. I've even taken the time to read Batman comics and graphic novels. I thought Christian Bale was an excellent choice of the lead role for the new films and thought the first one was a great start and I was really looking forward to this one. So how come I've just walked out of the cinema feeling very disappointed? Why? Because this film just wasn't that good. It's far too long, has very little fun in it and takes itself so seriously it's painful. The makers have thrown the kitchen sink at it with very little thought. The whole thing was one great, big, dreadful, noisy, mess. The only good thing in it is Heath Ledger's performance. I had my doubts when I first heard who'd they'd cast but I gotta hand it to Heath, he pulled it off. No thanks to the film however, which is so over cooked it's burnt. Sure there's loads of action, cool bat gadgets and lots of running about and shouting but absolutely no soul. It was great looking but has no personality. I felt neither happy, scared or even mildly concerned let alone entertained. I really didn't give a damn. So next time people, slim it down, less is more. It's not Apocalypse Now, put some fun into it.....Why so serious?",6.0,Anonymous,0.0005,0.9995,-0.999,"Action, Crime, Drama"
"Weird, sadistic, no redeeming value, really","The trick to these comic book superhero movies is not to take the source material too seriously. That's what made the original Batman from the 1980's, with Jack Nickolson as the Joker, work so well; everything about that movie, including all the main characters, was over the top, and rightfully so. We are, after all, talking about a man who goes out and fights crime while dressed up as a bat. How seriously, really, are we supposed to take such a notion? But this movie (among its various other flaws) takes itself WAY too seriously. It's supposed to be some deep, even epic, tale of, well, something. But, hey, if I want that, I could read Homer. Or Shakespeare. Or watch ""The Godfather"". Stories that truly are epic, in no small part because they feature real human characters, not ones that came out of a cartoon book.That said, I can only review so much of this movie because, quite honestly, I don't remember all that much from it. Nothing about it truly stood out in my mind, other than that the general theme seemed to be to inflict upon the audience several scenes of considerable cruelty and sadism. And, unlike in other movies where these qualities played a significant role (Silence of the Lambs, Apocalypse Now), here these elements seem to exist solely for shock value, not because they actually add anything to our deeper understanding of the story.Which brings us to the character of the Joker. Let me be blunt - Nickolson's Joker was at least ten times better than this one. Both are completely unbelievable, but Jack's Joker was at least interesting, even fun. He was a pleasure to watch in much the same way that a good James Bond villain is. But there is nothing pleasurable at all about Heath Ledger's Joker. First off, he is so psychotic that he couldn't function anywhere outside of an insane asylum; he kills off his own henchmen, burns their stolen money before their very eyes, yet this psycho somehow enlists a small army of loyal followers without giving them any reason to be loyal at all, and yet, despite being a complete walking mental meltdown, he manages to put in motion any number of very detailed terrorist plots that would require the exact opposite mindset, namely, one of cold and calculating rationality. In short, as a movie villain, he simply fails. Not only is he not credible at all, his sole contribution to the story is to add the aforementioned cruelty and sadism, making this not only a stupid and unbelievable movie, but a thoroughly depressing one as well. I mean, seriously. If you want to see movie characters who have a dark, twisted, and sadistic streak and yet come off as credible on the screen, one need look no further than such persons as Tommy from ""Goodfellas"" or Luca Brasi from ""The Godfather"". But the Joker from this film is just a void. Encountering his character was like stepping on a dog turd. The experience is wholly unpleasant and disgusting, but thankfully you forget about it pretty soon.3/10",3.0,Anonymous,0.0005,0.9995,-0.999,"Action, Crime, Drama"

The most *OVER-RATED* Top 10 film on IMDb,"I've been waiting for this film since I had seen Batman Begins in the cinema three/four years ago, but I was disappointed that I did not see anything new. It also didn't help that the plot in the film was muddled up. There were different subplots happening in between the film and by the last half I was totally lost; even my boyfriend has fallen asleep. I didn't like Maggie Gyllenhal's role as Rachael - she was bland as a blank of wood/black tea with no sugar, *really* boring as an actress!As usual, Bale puts on a great performance and I have always enjoyed the films he has been in from the past (Machinist, The Prestige, Equiliberium, Batman Begins, American Psycho). However, reprising his role as Bruce Wayne, I felt I hadn't seen anything fresh from his performance or, if there was, this was overshadowed by the film (I am sure he will make up for this in Terminator 4). I like Christopher Nolan as well as a director, but I think this film was all about money and not about quality film-making. Compare this film to Memento and The Prestige - the Dark Knight is nowhere near as good as those films. In other words, from the 'success' this film has made, it would look as though Nolan has sold out which is a real shame.I have idea no where thes hype about this film has come from, but I suspect it is because of the fact that people have been defining this film as one of Heath Ledger's ""finest performance"". Sure, his role as the Joker worked well on screen, but, even so, it is not worthy of winning a BAFTA/Oscar for his performance. People have generously given this film either a 9/10 simply because they have bought the fascination surrounding Ledger's performance/death along with the excessive violence and not judging on this film, realistically.This film is worth no more than a 6, I am afraid - it should NOT be in IMDb's top 10.

An untouchable piece of fiction brought to life in unfathomably ground-breaking fashion.,""" You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain""Opening with a cunning master-show; a blisteringly devious bank heist that gives us the most iconic villain ever to grace the screen. A creepy Glasgow smile that keeps us up at night, spooking, haunting and endlessly projecting in our psyches for years and years, echoing from generation through generation. Everything holds up so well, in fact too well. The Dark Knight is a monolithic milestone of vigilante epicness, a hard-boiled crime noir masquerading as a PG-13 superhero movie, and a heroic ode for the ages.Clap, Clap, Clap (in Joker's manner) for Nolan's ballistic nihilism, no holds barred mannerism and his spectacular vision has bequeathed us with multiple moral time-bombs, finely-tuned characterizations and dynamically explosive set-pieces: fake Batmans sequence, Harvey vs Rachel,
18-wheeler truck spinning and flipping upside down and Joker's brazenly blasting at the Batpod and so on. The villains have largely overpowered our hero in this one as darkness triumphantly cloaks up daylight, subverting the very foundation of comic-book genre, showing something we haven't seen before.Similar to that magic pencil, The Dark Knight is relentless with its freakishly brutal power, casting an Abracadabra that's capable of knocking you out, mind-blown and ice cold on the floor. Dark and somber but equally rich in aesthetics, rainy Gotham City is as beautiful as it is immersive. So bleak there's almost no hope left and tensions are boisterously fueled by atmospheric dangers looming near, mercilessly raising the stakes up to 10000 degrees Celsius blazing fire. With many maze-like twists possessing such unpredictable nature similar to its crazy antagonist(s), this showdown is twistedly deranged, exciting and tragic in equal measures.A film, so monumental, its impact cannot be understated.

"Some great things, a few poor things","Remember when the joker explains why he uses a knife instead of a gun? He prefers to savour the little details, read between the lines, appreciate the moment. As opposed to a violent, quick thrill of a gun. For me this film ended up being more like a machine gun than a knife.Let's start with the excellent aspects of this film. Strong performances - Bale is fantastic, Michael Caine and Morgan freeman always produce excellent performances and this again does not disappoint, Heath ledger is impeccable. Music score is incredible by Hans Zimmer. Cannot imagine a better soundtrack is possible for this film. Epic use of image, immersing cinematography, the make up and costume department need a raise.What's a mixed bag and what's poor . The plot - the plot is decent, but far from outstanding. It's about half an hour too long. There's certainly one chapter too many. In the last 45 mins we have hospital gate and ferry gate. You really need to choose only one there. The ferry scene paints to us what the joker is trying to prove - that when it comes down to it everyone will become selfish, save themselves before others no matter the cost. However I don't think they quite hit the nail on the head with it. The way it pans out, for me, is too unrealistic. Call it my lack of faith in human nature. I feel a more believable scenario of human heroism would've sent a stronger message. Hospital gate provides very little to the plot, except 20 mins of watching a headache. Philosophical themes and execution - Heath Ledger's acting is incredible so don't come at me, but the joker is too one dimensional. I get it, he likes chaos, but I want more depth. It may be good enough for the comics but not for a film to the caliber of this one. There's just a little too much spoon feeding dialogue. All this talk about chaos and human nature. Allow the audience to read between the lines, decifer the deeper meanings for themselves. Be a knife, not a gun. Pacing - I can't really fault the pacing until it comes to Harvey's transformation into two face. This part of the film is really poor. Even when I watched this film as a kid I was like come on. It's not even a character arc , he more or less wakes up a sadistic maniac, like Peter Parker just wakes up as spider man. Im not saying two face is a bad character, but a substantially more amount of time is necessary for us as the audience to realistically believe this transformation from hero to villain. And lastly, the film is just a bit too crash bang wallop. Just turn the volume down a little bit.Now, I admit this review focuses more on the bad than the good. I can only say that's because everyone rates this film so highly that I think the weaknesses are more relevant. It's a great film and I understand the hype. But we have to admit there are major flaws to this film. I hate the way people really brand the word about 'overrated' , I don't like using it - it makes you sound as a sort of Scrooge. However , with an IMDB rating of 9/10 I think there might be a strong case for it right here.",7.0,Anonymous,0.0083,0.9917,-0.9833,"Action, Crime, Drama"
NOLAS IS A GENIUS.,"""Batman: The Dark Knight"" is an absolute masterpiece that transcends the superhero genre and stands as one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time.One of the most remarkable aspects of this film is Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker. Ledger's portrayal of the iconic villain is nothing short of mesmerizing. He completely disappears into the character, delivering a chilling and unforgettable performance. Ledger's Joker is chaotic, unpredictable, and utterly compelling. His every scene is a masterclass in acting, and it's no surprise that he posthumously won an Academy Award for his role.Christian Bale continues to excel as Bruce Wayne/Batman. His brooding intensity and unwavering commitment to the role make him one of the most compelling Batman interpretations to date. Bale's dedication to his craft is evident in every scene, and he brings a complex depth to the character.Aaron Eckhart's portrayal of Harvey Dent/Two-Face is another standout performance. His transformation from a principled district attorney to a vengeful and disfigured villain is handled with nuance and skill. It's a tragic arc that adds emotional weight to the film.The film's screenplay, penned by Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan Nolan, is a triumph of storytelling. It weaves together multiple plot threads, themes of morality, chaos, and the nature of heroism, and keeps the audience on the edge of their seats from start to finish.

Christopher Nolan's second installment in the Batman trilogy takes everything that made ""Batman Begins"" great and cranks it up to an entirely new level.First and foremost, Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of legendary. His performance is haunting, mesmerizing, and unforgettable. Ledger's Joker is a chaotic force of nature, and his ability to channel the character's madness is truly remarkable. It's a performance that stands as one of the greatest in cinematic history.Christian Bale continues to excel as Batman, bringing depth and complexity to the role. The film's exploration of Batman's moral dilemmas and the blurred lines between heroism and vigilantism add a layer of sophistication to the character.The supporting cast, including Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, Michael Caine as Alfred, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, all deliver outstanding performances that contribute to the film's overall brilliance.What sets ""The Dark Knight"" apart from other superhero movies is its gritty and realistic portrayal of Gotham City. Nolan's direction and use of practical effects create a visually stunning and immersive world that feels tangible and lived-in.The film's themes of chaos, morality, and the consequences of one's actions are thought-provoking and add depth to the narrative. The moral dilemmas faced by the characters make for a compelling and complex story that keeps you engaged from start to finish.Additionally, Hans Zimmer's score is pulse-pounding and adds to the tension and excitement of the film's action sequences.""The Dark Knight"" is more than just a superhero movie; it's a dark and gripping crime drama that explores the darkest corners of the human psyche. It's a film that challenges the audience to think and leaves a lasting impact.

best,"Iconic! ""The Dark Knight,"" directed by Christopher Nolan, is a cinematic tour de force that redefines the superhero genre. Released in 2008, this film stands as a testament to the transformative power of storytelling and the impact of exceptional performances. At its core, Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of legendary. Ledger's posthumous Academy Award-winning performance elevates the character beyond a mere antagonist, making the Joker a symbol of chaotic brilliance and anarchy.Christian Bale, reprising his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman, brings a brooding intensity that complements the film's exploration of duality and morality. Nolan's direction is masterful, creating a gritty and realistic Gotham City that becomes a character in itself. The cinematography, coupled with Hans Zimmer's haunting score, adds layers of tension and depth to the narrative.""The Dark Knight"" transcends the typical superhero narrative, evolving into a crime thriller that delves into the complexities of heroism.

You Either Die a Hero or Live Long Enough to See Yourself Become the Villain,"It's a very soft 9, but it's a 9/10 for me.Directed by Christopher Nolan and written by Christopher Nolan, Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer - these guys are in their primes here. Not that the same isn't true of some of the actors involved in this film, Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart.It's hard for me to do a review on this film and certainly the character of the late Heath Ledger is one of the greatest villains in cinema history. He is played to perfection. Perfect would even be putting it mildly. Ledger is so great in this film that all the awards and recognition he has received from around the world are too little.Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Gary Oldman are all super, but the one who shines brightest out of the entire cast with the exception of Ledger is Aaron Eckhart and his character, Harvey Dent/Two Face, Christopher Nolan's hidden ace. A perfect addition to the film's story.The action scenes are OK, the sound is good, the film is generally very good technically and is far from the most successful in the genre, but the acting, the pacing and the story itself make The Dark Knight (2008) the giant that it is.I recommend it along with the other two installments in the series, ""Batman Begins"" (2005), and the not-so-good ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012).Final score: 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9977,"Action, Crime, Drama"
"Ledger saves pretentious, overwrought superhero movie","Oddly enough, I don't go into a theater before watching a blockbuster movie with the expectation that it'll be over-hyped and bloated; that's just how it turns out from time to time. No, I have reasonable expectations just like the next guy.As I check out the reactions to The Dark Knight, I notice a common thread - everyone likes the movie. Particularly, everyone seems enamored of Heath Ledger's unhinged, magnificent, and terrifying performance as The Joker. Straight out, I want to make clear that I completely agree. Ledger isn't just some ham acting out in a clown costume; we had Jack Nicholson do that already, nearly twenty years ago. Ledger commands the screen not with an over-the-top performance but a scene-stealing, subtle one. His makeup masks not only a despicable demon who hurts for the sake of causing pain but also a troubled, carefully shaded character worthy of Shakespeare's finest plays.Let's first get to what I didn't like. Many of the main roles are miscast, sometimes badly so. Christian Bale returns as the Caped Crusader, but if anything his performance is more wooden than in the movie's predecessor, Batman Begins. See, I've always thought the complex Batman character should be someone who's consumed by inner demons, one who even when unmasked reveals only some layers while hinting at much greater depths. And I never get that impression with Bale as Batman: He is what you see, and little more. Yes, we know he's got this secret identity thing going, and he doesn't tell people everything, and that's nice. Endearing, even. But Bale's inadequacies as an actor show up in spades here, because I never get the feeling that there's more than meets the eye. Bale's Batman doesn't feel like he's consumed by demons in the least; he seems like a pretty boy with a lot of money who likes to torture (yes, torture) and kill bad guys without any of the blame or acclaim.Moving along, we have a new Rachel Dawes, aka The Love Interest, played this time by Maggie Gyllenhaal, who's a monumental improvement over the wretched performance that Katie Holmes gave in Batman Begins. Even so, as has been noted elsewhere, Gyllenhaal is too intelligent, her eyes too ironically knowing, to play the role. She seems out of place, because she's smarter than Rachel Dawes - an assistant DA - is. (Of course, we don't see much of Rachel doing DA stuff; we see her running from place to place in a panic, or professing her love for Harvey Dent through nonverbal ways, or smiling coquettishly.) So: Like the Maggie Gyllenhaal, a LOT, but she was far better than her character was written. Someday they'll get it right.And then there's the third wheel to the love triangle: Harvey Dent, played by Aaron Eckhart. Now, you have to set aside Tommy Lee Jones's performance as Dent in one of the earlier Batman movies, because this is a new Bativerse, and it's like those other movies never happened. Dent eventually becomes the physically and mentally scarred Two-Face, but Eckhart can't quite handle the heavy lifting that the complicated character demands. When you see Eckhart, you think of likable cad, the slightly slimy guy who's better than the real hero at basically everything. But in a charming way. Here, Dent's a noble crusader, the district attorney who's going to clean up Gotham, but Eckhart is just another toothy, slick, Ken doll who's there just to look good. The way Eckhart plays Dent, you'd think he was just an affable fellow who wants to do the right thing; as with Bruce Wayne, there doesn't seem to be any undercurrent of ulterior motives, nothing to see here, please disperse. Eckhart, despite having studied split personalities in preparing for the role, is clearly in way over his head here.The movie itself is overlong, even bloated. It seems the in thing nowadays to have a movie end several times - you know, to keep the Great Unwashed on their toes. Oh my goodness! It's not over yet! What will happen next? But surely there's a way to do this without producing a film that's two and a half hours long. If you're going to make a movie that long, be my guest, but the movie should be more than our heroes running from action scene to action scene, particularly when those action scenes are in dark, dank Gotham City.But here are some positives, to make sure all bases are covered. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine exude effortless efficiency as Lucien and Alfred, respectively, doing far more for the movie than it for them. Both act as Bruce's conscience, and both roles were written as to be completely believable. Professionalism is always a plus when casting superhero movies. And some of those vaunted action scenes are a lot of fun to watch, although many of them seem to involve Batman jumping off a building, Batman climbing down the side of a building, or Batman throwing someone else off a building. In the dark. Because it's supposed to be gloomy ol' Gotham.So for me, The Dark Knight was a disappointment. It's not a bad little film, but it felt too loose, as if writers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan had decided on an ending and then threw everything they could think of into the plot to reach that goal. This happens to a lot of middling action films - the hero races to point A, escapes certain death, races to point B, escapes certain death, repeat ad infinitum. Same sort of thing here, only we don't even get clever plotting that we might expect from what's purportedly a higher grade of superhero movie. There's much chaos in The Dark Knight, but ultimately the maelstrom of disorder consumes, rather than engages, the viewer. Dark Night is elegy to the great potential - realized and unrealized - that's forever lost with the death of Heath Ledger.",6.0,Anonymous,0.9938,0.0062,0.9875,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Proving that Comic Book Movies can be more,"It surprises me that 12 years has passed since this film was released, and no other film of the super-hero genre have surpassed this one in terms of quality. Not one of the MCU, neither of the DCEU. Of course, we had great super-heroes films, but the Dark Knight have something else. I think it's the philosophical part. Not trying to be 'deep' or play the smart one, it's just the part that captivated me the most. The idea of Batman being the 'ugly hero', the monologue of Gordon in the ending of the film is outstanding and one of the reason I love Batman. Joker, that is heavily based on the version of the graphic novel Killing Joke of Alan Moore. The agent of chaos and anarchy that have a twisted vision of the world. The 'madness is like gravity' phrase have the same concept of this quote of The Killing Joke ""All it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy. That's how far the world is from where I am. Just one bad day."" Of course there's more than that, I loved Harvey Dent, Joker's 'social experiment' moment is just so powerful. The concept of a hero defeating the villain not with punchs and kicks, but proving that his view of world and ideology are both wrong, is just fantastic and I knew Christopher Nolan wouldn't gave us less than that.About the rest, that makes this film even more interesting. Of course Nolan's directing, he's not that good at action sequences, but nothing you can't ignore. The amazing soundtrack of Hans Zimmer, his music brings the build-up necessary to increase the tension and adds more emotions to the film's most memorable moments. There's much more things that makes this film so great, but the charm is without doubt Heath Ledger's acting, a groundbreaking perfomance, he steals every scene he's in, he's charismatic, even portraying a sociopath, his laugh, the mannerisms, everything about his character is great. One of the few comic book films that are a masterpiece, but if they all were this good, gems like this film wouldn't as relevant as it is.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"

The casting is flawless, quite well selected in entire trilogy. Christian Bale show his chameleon skills going from Bruce to Batman as fast and certain as you can flip a coin. Tha usually romantic Aaron Eckheart, is also broken in two, and instead of switching from edges, he merge'em resulting in the only Harvey Two Face, in the cinema that could be taken seriously.

The Dark Knight,"Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" isn't merely a superhero movie; it's a magnum opus that redefines the genre. At its core is Heath Ledger's haunting portrayal of the Joker, a character study that delves into the darkest corners of human psyche. Ledger's performance is a revelation, crafting a Joker that is simultaneously terrifying and captivating.Christian Bale's Batman/Bruce Wayne is equally compelling, showcasing the internal struggle of a hero burdened by his sense of duty and the blurred line between justice and vengeance. The supporting cast, including Aaron Eckhart, Gary Oldman, and Morgan Freeman, deliver exceptional performances, adding layers of complexity to the narrative.Nolan's direction is nothing short of genius, transforming Gotham City into a character itself-a gritty, sprawling urban landscape plagued by crime and corruption. The film's action sequences are meticulously choreographed, and the practical effects create a visceral sense of realism rarely seen in superhero films.What sets ""The Dark Knight"" apart is its exploration of moral ambiguity and the choices that define us.

Pretty soon the new batman vs Superman will be coming out although I myself am not really a D.C fan I am definitely going to be seeing that after I watch Marvels Captain America World At War maybe after seeing Batman V.S Superman I may convert into a D.C fan and after seeing pictures of the movie that is a very likely chance,8.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9977,"Action, Crime, Drama"
"TDK, a solid superhero movie, nothing more","After reading quite a few reviews from the states i was very curious about this movie. As a kid i loved to read superhero comic books, spiderman and batman were my favourites. Loving the spiderman movies and also liking the first new Batman movie by Nolan and wanting to see the last performance by Heath Ledger i couldn't wait to see this movie.Man was i disappointed.Don't get me wrong, i liked the movie, i had fun with it and the performance bij Heath Ledger is something i will never forget. I was sceptical about him because people tend to exaggerate performances of popular dead actors but i must honestly admit, he blew me away. He also blew every actor away he shared screen time with, i liked gary oldman best together with him in a scene. I am still wowed by Hedgers performance, and i must admit i really feel frustrated that he is gone, this performance MUST get an Oscar.Caine was very good, Bale was OK although i don't like him as batman, he is a good Bruce Wayne but not a good batman and i really enjoyed Aaron Eckart as Harvey Dent.But i thought the movie also had quite a few flaws.Without giving away too much i really though most of the combat action scenes were not easily watchable because they were to fast to follow, I really didn't like the way they went with two face, and the ending sequence with the bat and the joker to me was a let down. Also i don't like the way Nolan tells the story but i must admit, thats a personal opinion.There were 2 surprising moments that i really loved, one containing a pencil which got me laughing very hard and the other the choice sequence which ended in a way i didn't see coming but loved it.All in all, an OK superhero movie, 7 stars but 9? come on people, that's crazy.It's unbelievable that movies like the matrix 1 , gladiator, as good as it gets, l.a. confidential, eternal sunshine and the spotless mind don't rank as high as this movie, i cant understand it although i respect it.Happy to share my feel about this movie,Realkane",7.0,Anonymous,0.9986,0.0014,0.9972,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Is The Dark Knight that good... really? 'Fraid not.,"The Dark Knight is an extraordinary mish-mash lacking logic and cohesion.Technically, the film is well made. That is, it looks and feels like a blockbuster, though a solid score is sorely lacking.On the plus side, Michael Caine and Gary Oldman add gravitas to an otherwise ordinary ensemble.And sadly, a fine actor will be remembered, not for the likes of moving and sensitive performances seen in Brokeback Mountain and Candy, but rather an excellent make-up job, an over-active tongue and a silly voice. As farewell performances rate, Heath Ledger's Joker sits alongside Peter Sellers' Fiendish Plot of Dr Fu Manchu.To remind yourself how super hero movies should be made, dust off your copy of Spiderman II (from which it borrows) or Superman The Movie (from which it should've borrowed).",5.0,Anonymous,0.0005,0.9995,-0.999,"Action, Crime, Drama"

The Dark Knight: A Masterpiece of Modern Cinema,"Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" stands as a towering achievement in the realm of superhero cinema, transcending genre conventions to deliver a gripping and thought-provoking exploration of heroism, morality, and the nature of chaos. With its complex characters, thrilling action sequences, and profound themes, this film captivates audiences from beginning to end, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of modern cinema.At the heart of ""The Dark Knight"" is Heath Ledger's mesmerizing performance as the Joker, one of the most iconic villains in cinematic history. Ledger's portrayal is nothing short of legendary, capturing the anarchic spirit of the character with a chilling intensity and magnetic charisma. His Joker is a force of nature, a chaotic agent who seeks to upend the established order and expose the hypocrisy and corruption that lurk beneath the surface of society.Opposite Ledger's Joker stands Christian Bale's Batman, a brooding and conflicted figure grappling with his own inner demons and the moral complexities of his crusade against crime. Bale brings a quiet intensity to the role, imbuing Batman with a sense of gravitas and depth that grounds the film amidst its larger-than-life spectacle.But ""The Dark Knight"" is more than just a battle between hero and villain; it's a nuanced exploration of the blurred lines between good and evil, order and chaos. Nolan deftly weaves together multiple narrative threads, from the escalating conflict between Batman and the Joker to the ethical dilemmas faced by Gotham's law enforcement and political elite. The result is a film that is as intellectually stimulating as it is viscerally thrilling, challenging audiences to grapple with the complexities of morality and justice in a world plagued by corruption and violence.Of course, ""The Dark Knight"" is also a technical marvel, with breathtaking action sequences, stunning visual effects, and a haunting score by Hans Zimmer that heightens the film's sense of tension and unease. Every frame is meticulously crafted, from the towering skyscrapers of Gotham City to the shadowy alleyways where the Dark Knight prowls.In the end, ""The Dark Knight"" is more than just a superhero movie; it's a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre to become a timeless work of art. Whether you're a fan of comic books or not, this is a film that demands to be seen and appreciated for its bold storytelling, impeccable craftsmanship, and profound thematic depth.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9979,"Action, Crime, Drama"

The Batman,"The Dark Knight was most definitely one of the better movies I've had the pleasure of viewing and it did not fail to meet any preconceived notions or ideas which I formed already. Everything, from the phenomenal performance of the gifted set of actors to the amazing stunts and action executed, was beautifully and concisely produced. Starting with the actors and their performance, I believe that Heath Ledger was the best Joker the Batman Universe has yet to see; his expressed nuances and habits that he evokes to portray the Joker are something to be marveled. In one of the most famous scenes of not just the movie but of cinematic history, Heath Ledger poses the question to a mob leader while holding him at knife point: Why so serious? Heath Ledger was one of the best casting jobs of the movie. Another good casting job of the movie is of Christian Bale's. He plays Bruce Wayne/ Batman in The Dark Knight and he brings the mystery and reclusiveness and charisma that he embodies as both personalities. However, while I sing praises of the movie thus far, I don't feel as though it deserves a 10 of 10 as a score. There is a little amount of movie material that can be considered worthy of such a score and The Dark Knight is no exception. At some points in the movie, the plot revolves more around the technology that has been developed and it would have been a better movie to explore and ascertain Bruce Wayne's/Batman's loyalty and moral character and how both characters find a growth of personal morality and justice.",9.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Another masterpiece by Christopher Nolan,"One word: Amazing. Not much to say besides that.Christopher Nolan brings us a new Batman against joker story that takes the title for best.The idea that Batman can't do anything. The idea that joker is the best criminal.Heath Ledger was amazing.You're on the edge of your seat the entire time.There are only two things I'm complaining about and that stopped me from rating it a 10.1. When Batman is going to save Rachel, he could've saved both by sending teams out each way to each location, but he didn't. Why?2. Harvey Dent blames Batman for the death of Rachel. Why? He knows perfectly well that Batman is at least trying to be the hero here. So when Batman tells him to point the gun at the people responsible, why the heck does he point it at Batman??Otherwise, this film is, if not the best, one of the best films Nolan has brought us. 9/10.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Batman (2020) was not better then this,"This was a near-perfect masterpiece, it's what Marvel wishes it could do. The movie had tons of action scenes and a great storyline, it had the best Joker of all time. Ledger's approach to Joker wasn't the corny 1900s Joker, where he was making corny cartoon jokes. Ledger's joker was a psychological joker, that messed with people's minds and had them looking in every which direction. Bale was phenomenal, he was an incredible Bruce Wayne, was disappointed that the original Rachel dropped the movie though. It was an amazing experience to watch this movie. 10/10 would recommend anyone to watch this movie, if they would like to be entertained for 2.5 hours, it's worth it.RIP: Health Ledger, you were gone too soon.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9979,"Action, Crime, Drama"
A Visual Masterpiece,"The world of superheroes has always been captivated by larger-than-life characters, but none have left as indelible a mark on pop culture as the iconic Dark Knight. Batman, a character beloved for his complex persona and thrilling adventures, has been brought to life in various mediums, but with the latest film, it's clear that the Caped Crusader has found a new home on the big screen. The 2023 Batman film, directed by visionary filmmaker David Fincher, is a visual masterpiece that brings this iconic character to life in ways that have never been seen before.For someone like me, whose introduction to Batman came through animated series and comics, this film was a thrilling revelation. I was initially drawn to the character through the brilliant Batman: The Animated Series and various comic books. However, seeing Batman in a live-action setting, enhanced by state-of-the-art visual effects (VFX), was a game-changer. The film takes the character's appeal and magnifies it, creating a cinematic experience that is as thrilling as it is visually stunning.The supporting cast is equally impressive. Selina Kyle, portrayed by a charismatic actress, embodies the complex and enigmatic Catwoman. Her chemistry with Batman is palpable, and their dynamic adds depth to the story. The film also introduces a formidable antagonist in the form of the Riddler, played by an actor who brings a chilling and intellectual malevolence to the character. The way the Riddler's elaborate puzzles and clues are woven into the narrative keeps the audience engaged in a thrilling and suspenseful mystery. Whether you're a long-time Batman aficionado or a newcomer to the world of Gotham City, this film is a must-see.

"Bold without ever being especially great, and which progressively gets less-interesting; the film is a wild concoction of ideas that just about treads water.","Some of the very first words Christian Bale utters as the eponymous role of 'soon-to-be-Batman' Bruce Wayne, in the preceding Batman film to this entitled Batman Begins, are to a thug in a remote prison located in the Far East: ""you're not The Devil, you're practise"" he hisses. The feeling's that 2008's The Dark Knight is where the practise ends and the fight with The Devil begins. This is my second crack at writing something up about the film, and while what I said initially was a little unfocused and targeted the wrong areas; I stand by the initial grade I gave it and similarly retained that similar sense of feeling underwhelmed when it finished. Even if it is deemed that The Dark Knight is one of the better comic book adaptations ever made, this is not saying a terrible lot given the bulk of entries in said film canon.That old problem of dealing with the war genre and doing one's very best to document war as a horrid, gut-wrenching thing whilst maintaining sequences of war that cannot help but carry a sense of spectacle anyway, rears its head here. The Dark Knight documents a war on terrorism and sees Christohper Nolan attempt to echo a greater sense of things in the real world as he unleashes a character known as The Joker (Ledger) amongst the inhabitants of Gotham City, The results of his terrorist 'acts' in bringing down entire buildings allow Nolan to shoot the wreckage of said act with firefighters in the foreground and smoking rubble in the back, clearly calling on immediate 'post' imagery of the 9/11 New York attacks. Incidentally, and as one source which escapes me suggested, Joker's videos of captives held and forced to talk into video cameras evoke the actions of overseas terrorist cells, and their own methods of getting the message across to The West; while most of his scenes in which he is seen pottering around an area trying to intimidate carry an odd, distorted and erratic hand held aesthetic suggesting danger, distortion and chaos. Later on, semiology linked to fire fighting will be used again in the briefest of fashions, when a certain character, who's under threat from The Joker, is being transported in a police van: a burning fire truck is used as a blockade, and Nolan cleverly instills a further sense of victimised anguish into the audience.In addition to biting all of this off, Nolan does his best to render the film a gangster film-come-neo noir whilst operating under this banner of a low MPAA/BBFC rating as the film additionally attempts to draw on parallels between The Joker, Batman and a third piece to the triangle in district attorney Harvey Dent (Eckhart). Indeed the film opens with an audacious robbery of mob money, as perpetrated by The Joker; his menace established by the fact his cohorts contribute varying perspectives of the man whilst we perceive him to still be off screen. The robbery itself carries a clever twist in that each member kills the other when his job is done, a small but highly affecting twinge to proceedings as dreamt up by The Joker thus cementing his personality and mindset in being able to cook up something such as this. As a fighter of crime, Dent lacks the physical strength Batman does but talks a good talk and is able to place a number of criminals in jail after some hard work as he adopts his own stance on the front line of crime. Shortly afterwards, it is Gary Oldman's police lieutenant Jim Gordon whom refers to him as Gotham's ""white knight"", suggesting the man shares a similar overview to Batman's ""dark"" but is just different in technique and characteristics.Joker's parallel with Batman sees the film establish such a relationship by way of two accompanying scenes, one seeing The Joker and a handful of representatives from Gotham's gangs occupy a kitchen and talk of certain issues. Annoyingly, the representatives are your more generic bling-wielding African-Americans; well dressed Italian American mobsters and gruff, greasy haired eastern European criminals. Cut to Gordon, Batman and Dent beside the bat signal doing the exact same thing but whose discussions and ideologies obviously differ; a later pairing of sequences seeing The Joker deal with a black criminal, whom he feels ought to be working with him, in a blunt fashion just as Batman does the same to a Chinese businessman named Lau whom he feels similarly towards in this sense, thus suggesting a more intrinsic link between the two. As is the rule of thumb in films such as Heat or American Gangster, Joker and Batman share a sequence in which they sit opposite one another at a table; on this occasion, and as other sources have stated, right before contemporary issues on the treatment of terrorists once in custody have arisen.Where the film falls apart is its want to cater to an audience with superhero sub-genre frills, an interesting parallel drawn up between Dent as a frothing at the mouth monster named Two-Face seeking revenge and Batman, as two people differently channelling anger born out of injustices towards people they love plays out, but getting bogged down with out of sorts fight scenes and ridiculous sequences in 'sonar vision' which does nothing but juvenalise adult content. Most of the second unit stuff is nowhere near as interesting as the talk and studious observations on identity and personality; a chase through a tunnel which spills onto the streets involving a police van; a large truck and a bat-bike rather underwhelming. The film relies on rife corruption all too often to further its narrative so as to send it down another avenue of twists and turns, ultimately a story which is not as interesting as all the aforementioned character studies and power play going on as binary opposites supposedly attract and everybody's linked to each other. Ultimately only fleetingly interesting, and all too often feels bogged down.",6.0,Anonymous,0.0566,0.9434,-0.8867,"Action, Crime, Drama"

I love a good Batman movie this movie was probably the best Batman movie ever,"Title: ""A Cinematic Triumph: 'The Dark Knight' Reimagines Batman Like Never Before""Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" stands as a masterpiece of modern cinema. Released in 2008, this film marked a pivotal moment in the superhero genre, forever changing the way audiences perceive not only Batman but also the entire genre itself. With a mesmerizing blend of storytelling, unforgettable performances, and groundbreaking visuals, ""The Dark Knight"" remains an iconic achievement.At its core, ""The Dark Knight"" is a crime drama wrapped in the guise of a superhero movie. Unlike its predecessors, this installment presents Batman as a complex vigilante facing moral dilemmas rather than a mere caped crusader fighting crime. Christian Bale reprises his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman and delivers a mesmerizing performance. His portrayal is a perfect blend of brooding intensity and vulnerability, allowing the audience to empathize with the inner turmoil of the character.However, the true standout performance in ""The Dark Knight"" is Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker. Ledger's take on the iconic Batman villain is nothing short of extraordinary. His Joker is an agent of chaos, a sadistic and unpredictable force who challenges Batman both physically and philosophically. Ledger's commitment to the role is palpable, and he disappears into the character, leaving the audience in awe of his magnetic and chilling performance. It's no exaggeration to say that Ledger's Joker is one of the most iconic and memorable villains in cinematic history.The supporting cast also shines in their respective roles. Gary Oldman's Commissioner Gordon is the moral compass of Gotham City, and Aaron Eckhart's Harvey Dent is a charismatic district attorney whose transformation into Two-Face is both tragic and compelling. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine bring depth and wisdom to their characters, providing the emotional grounding needed amidst the chaos.Nolan's direction is nothing short of visionary. He creates a dark and gritty Gotham City that feels both hauntingly realistic and heightened in its cinematic grandeur. The action sequences are expertly choreographed and shot, immersing the audience in the heart-pounding intensity of Batman's world. Nolan's use of practical effects and minimal CGI adds a tangible weight to the film's action, making every punch and explosion feel real.One of the most remarkable aspects of ""The Dark Knight"" is its exploration of complex moral themes. The film delves into questions of justice, morality, and the nature of heroism. Batman's ethical code is put to the test as he faces the Joker's nihilistic philosophy. The film challenges the audience to consider the cost of heroism and the blurred line between hero and villain.In addition to its thematic depth, ""The Dark Knight"" is a masterclass in storytelling. The script, co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, is a taut and intelligent narrative that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. The film's pacing is impeccable, with each scene building upon the last, leading to a breathtaking climax that will leave you breathless.Hans Zimmer's score is another element that elevates ""The Dark Knight"" to a cinematic tour de force. The hauntingly beautiful music underscores the emotional beats of the film, heightening the tension and drama. Zimmer's use of recurring motifs, such as the Joker's theme, adds a layer of psychological depth to the characters.It's worth noting that ""The Dark Knight"" is not a typical superhero film. It transcends the genre by delivering a mature and thought-provoking narrative that appeals to a broad audience. While it contains thrilling action sequences and epic battles, it also explores the human side of its characters, making it a character-driven drama that just happens to involve superheroes.In conclusion, ""The Dark Knight"" is a cinematic triumph that redefined the superhero genre. Christopher Nolan's visionary direction, Heath Ledger's unforgettable performance as the Joker, and the film's exploration of complex moral themes all contribute to its status as a modern classic. It's a film that continues to resonate with audiences and stands as a testament to the power of storytelling in cinema. Whether you're a fan of Batman or simply a lover of great filmmaking, ""The Dark Knight"" is a must-see that will leave you pondering its themes long after the credits roll.",9.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Also, there was really no Batman/Bruce Wayne complex which I enjoy and feel is important to every Batman film. Overall a good action film, but will not be adding to my Batman movie collection.

Gimme A Break,"This is the future comic book adaptations are headed? THEN WATCH...ME..GO. What a sucker punch. I had such a big hopes (mostly because of the hype created by people who invested millions into this flop), that it really hurts me to say, the biggest disappointment in 2008 was this movie. (Although, I still can't say it was the worst) There is nobody I can warn about this movie since I was probably the last person to see it on the earth, But-Man, to see a great franchise falling this low?! Millions of dollars spent on this movie, could have ended the poverty on this world, and I couldn't see anything to justify the spending. For example the bat-cave, in this movie is an undecorated, plain, underground garage. Fhuy!!

Not to mention it was so uncomfortable that Christian B. couldn't even move properly in it,(heck, he couldn't even speak properly in it), so all the fight scenes were TERRIBLE, hidden in dark or under a stroboscope light.

good,"""According to what I believe, what doesn't kill a person makes him strange.""Normally, I had no intention of watching this legend tonight. When I came across it on a TV channel, I got stuck on it. Then, when I realized how bad the dubbing was and that the movie would not be watched in this way, I turned on my 1080p format to watch the movie from the beginning without ads and in its original language.This movie is at the beginning of very special movies for me. It is so for many people. Because in this film there is one of the most meaningful acting Deceptions among the approximately 800 films I have watched. And that's Heath Ledger. What makes it meaningful is that he died after the movie was made. He Decamped from us 6 months before the film was released. He has such a performance in this film that his Wildcard character goes into a completely different dimension. Such performances are very few. One of the biggest advantages of the film is itself. Even though I've only watched this movie, my favorites are also at the beginning.This series has brought a completely new style and atmosphere to superhero movies. The biggest part of this is Christopher Nolan's. He is my favorite director. All his films travel on the border of legends. Except for the first one or two movies. They are not bad either, just below their own performance. The director has also assembled such a cast that it is a very difficult cast to get together again. Dec. A very wide cast, from old legends to new stars.As a Lord Of The Rings fan, I'm saying this by putting aside the entire series. It tops the best movies I've seen. I've watched a lot of movies, but I've never seen a movie as full of every second and loaded with meaning every second as this movie. There is not the slightest superfluous scene in the film. A movie that you should keep your eyes open and watch every second. Let this movie come to cinemas again now, I'll wait at the door in the morning and go to the first session.

Too long...I just wanted it to end,"Not a great Batman film fan because of the past films turning it into a dark farce, but I thought I would give this more serious one a go. At the start I quite enjoyed it. I like Bale and I liked the serious way of filming it where gravity did exist and the characters weren't capable of doing really stupid things, like Spiderman.But it wasn't long before the story got a bit daft. A lot was happening that just started to ignore common sense. The story line just started to go anywhere as long as it got to the next part of the story. You constantly find yourself watching thinking ""but that wouldn't happen"".... Yeah its Batman, but when the story gets silly just to meet the outcome...well I kinda gave up on it.The story was very...well...confusing. It kept jumping around trying to be all twisty and clever but it just made me feel aggravated. The scene jumping got madder and madder as time went on...and on...and on....I soon found myself busting for the toilet, which got me wondering how long have I been watching this film for? This film is so bloated it is ridiculous. I kept thinking this next build up was the end...but then it just carried on. There are so many false horizons in this film it is unbelievable. This was one of those VERY rare times when I just wanted the film to end...I was begging it to end.Hard to sum this one up, as all I wanted for it to do...was end. I stopped paying attention to the countless stupid attempts at a story twist...I just didn't care. From what I remember it was a shallow storyline that I just didn't buy into.Now for my real moan...the high rating this film has on IMDb....evidence of more ratings corruption on this website. You used to be able to trust these film ratings but it appears that the marketing departments know exactly how to exaggerate these figures...which I find very annoying.

I rated his performance very highly and he deserves to be considered for any of the upcoming awards shows, truly on merit.I thought that Christian Bale was miscast and unconvincing, as Batman and there really wasn't very much of a story line to the movie. I cannot understand how this is rated a 9 out of 10 at present. That must mean, that all reviewers are between 18-30 and you are all giving it nine or ten.

The Price of Justice,"""The Dark Knight"" goes far beyond the label of a blockbuster or action film. Christopher Nolan crafts a powerful cinematic experience, confronting audiences with ethical and psychological dilemmas that stretch beyond the genre's conventions. Right from the start, the film challenges us to follow Batman in a struggle that goes beyond physical fights, diving deep into the dark territory of moral choices. More than a simple hero-villain face-off, Nolan shows just how much Bruce Wayne is driven-not by glory-but by a compulsive need to do what's right in a world where ""right"" is increasingly ambiguous. At its core, the film explores complex themes like sacrifice, surveillance, and the price of morality, redefining what to expect from a superhero adaptation.The backbone of ""The Dark Knight"" is the dynamic between Batman and the Joker, portrayed iconically by Heath Ledger. Ledger's Joker is utterly disturbing, driven by a logic-defying impulse to expose humanity's fragility. This Joker embodies chaos in its purest form, revealing and manipulating Gotham's and Batman's vulnerabilities. More than an antagonist, he's a chaotic force that pushes Batman to question his own values, forcing him to confront the moral shadows of his own actions. The Joker imposes impossible dilemmas on Gotham and Batman alike, serving as a twisted mirror for Bruce Wayne's limitations and the clash between justice and obsession.Christian Bale gives a gritty performance, turning Bruce Wayne into one of cinema's most complex characters. Instead of a perfect hero, his Batman is a man exhausted, torn between his commitment to protect Gotham and the personal toll of that mission. Bale brings a physicality to the role, using a raspy, intense voice under the cowl to express Batman's psychological weight. He masterfully balances the carefree playboy persona with the brooding vigilante, underscoring that Bruce is as masked in public as he is in the cape. In his interactions with the Joker, Bale conveys a complex mix of anger, frustration, and vulnerability, making him a powerful hero who struggles and wears down like anyone in Gotham. Bale's raw authenticity makes his Batman unforgettable, pushing beyond the superhero archetype into a movingly human portrayal.The urban setting of Gotham becomes another main character, with a darkly realistic design heightened by cinematography that avoids over-the-top visuals while retaining the city's oppressive identity. Gotham is a battlefield where fear and corruption touch every scene, reflecting the complex morality of its residents. Each shot is carefully crafted to create a space where Batman is a dark vigilante and paradoxically vulnerable, as if the very place constantly reminds him of the impossibility of eradicating evil completely. Nolan makes Gotham a believable city where heroism meets real-world barriers, adding to the thick, intense atmosphere throughout the film.Bruce Wayne's moral journey is heightened when he sees hope in Harvey Dent, believing him capable of carrying the weight of justice without turning to darkness. Aaron Eckhart plays Dent with idealistic energy that slowly breaks under pressure and tragedy, showing the fall of a ""White Knight"" into a haunting Two-Face. The story carefully parallels Dent's downfall with Batman's sacrifices, suggesting that even the purest heroes can be corrupted by pain and loss. This duality between Bruce and Dent deepens the story, and instead of simplifying the hero-villain theme, it builds complex characters who shift between light and shadow, highlighting the real cost of justice.Nolan boldly takes on contemporary ethical questions, like surveillance and power boundaries, exploring just how far security can justify the loss of privacy. Batman's use of mass surveillance technology to catch the Joker raises the ends-versus-means debate. This decision creates one of the movie's most crucial conflicts, with Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) acting as a moral compass, challenging Batman's methods. The clash between safety and ethics lends the film a relevance that resonates beyond fiction, sparking reflections on society and the role of power in protection or oppression. Nolan's choice to include this conversation elevates ""The Dark Knight"" from action flick to critical commentary, raising questions that stick with viewers.Technically, the film is flawless, with Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enriching the atmosphere with tension and emotional depth. The sound design is especially effective in Joker scenes, marked by a sharp, ominous sound that builds sinister anticipation before he even speaks. The action scenes, executed with realism and precision, are dynamic and visually impactful without overshadowing the plot or characters, always advancing the story. Nolan strategically uses every technical element to heighten the narrative, immersing viewers in Bruce Wayne's moral struggle-a vigilante constantly torn between his principles and actions.In the end, ""The Dark Knight"" transcends the superhero genre by diving into themes of morality, sacrifice, and humanity's darker side. Nolan drives a narrative that challenges audiences to see beyond the battle of good versus evil, questioning the cost of being a hero in a world where justice and ethics often clash. Batman's final image, bearing Gotham's sins and fading into the shadows, is one of cinema's most iconic and melancholy shots, capturing the weight of his burden and the complexity of his role. Ultimately, the film stands as a masterpiece that redefines genre expectations, leaving a lasting mark on both superhero films and the cinematic landscape.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9979,"Action, Crime, Drama"
RIP Heath Ledger,This movie has gotta have the best eerie soundtrack. Batman is so fun to watch and is my favorite character ever since I was just only 2 years old. I'd do anything I can to be the next big movie star for a big role like batman This trilogy is hands down the best thing ever to any superhero movie. I loved how Christian Bale played the role of Batman so well where we as the audience thinks that Christian's role actually suits his personal. I can promise you that even our own president of the United States at one point (Including the Audience) was definitely wanting to be Batman. Us as the Audience can say the same.,10.0,Anonymous,0.9988,0.0012,0.9976,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Best title of Dark Knight Trilogy,"I think dark night was the best in batman trilogy for some reasons.And one of them was brilliant act of Heath Ledger. In my opinion, the way he acts, makes the joker better than other movies and shows the joker more insane and more anarchist than ever. So he was worthy of Oscar.

Cr.NOLAN as we all know is the best writer!!! This movie has every thing A super hero, a Badass smart villain, a great story & some good acting. Heath Ledger(joker) was awesome! his acting was really remarkable.For me he was the best villain in the whole batman series. Christian Bale(batman) is always good so no comments for him! BATMAN is one of the most famous characters in DC comics so people have high expectations from this movie.But i assure you this movie will never disappoint you. Joker is a villain with no super powers, no advance gadgets but his intelligence is his greatest power.This movie shows the real potential of joker & what he can do or how he creates fear in the mind of the people of whole Gotham city with only his intelligence & craziness .The only thing is that this movie is a little bore in the start. other wise this movie is very good & i would really love to watch it again & again!!",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9979,"Action, Crime, Drama"
"Over long, rambling, episodic, pompous. Nice effects though.","Seeing it rated as the third best movie of all time by IMDb voters, and ranking up huge box office, I thought I'd give it a swing.I mostly wish I hadn't bothered. Like most super-hero movies nowadays, it's one gigantic battleship of a movie, weighed down by its humongous budget and massive running time. How many sub-plots do we need? How many conflicted characters, staring into the depths of their pompous souls? Visually - great. And the vfx crew have to be credited for some of the most seamless and impressive work ever done, on the city, the batmobile, the bat bike etc. Brilliant stuff.But the story, the script, the pacing - all pretty blaah. Did I give a damn about any of the characters? Did I really care what was going to happen next? Nope. Did I actually know what was going on half the time, what with the various criminals, their money, the money laundering guy, the Joker, the various Police Departments (what the hell is ""County""?). No, no, no. Boring. I was actually looking at my watch.The one intriguing episode in the film - with the ferries - is shoved in three quarters of the way through the film, and unceremoniously dumped once it has served its purpose in sticking other bits of the film together.So, all in all, I wish I'd spent the time some other way.",6.0,Anonymous,0.0005,0.9995,-0.999,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Easily the most overrated movie of all time,"Sorry guys, but this doesn't belong in the top 250's by any account. Its fight scenes, car chases, its effects, and its storyline were all mostly average. Momentum wasn't built up over the film at all, and worse, they dragged out scenes longer then they should have.In fact, this movie was in the top 250 list BEFORE it made it to cinema. Why? Because there are a few people who are overly enthusiastic about batman who used Heath's death as a marketing tool, over-hyped the movie and voted it upwards despite never having seen it. Just because a movie is based on a comic shouldn't mean it should be voted any differently (would anyone have liked this movie if Batman's costume was swapped). Yes, heath was good because he played something out of his general character, similar to how Jim Carrey did in Spotless mind. But...9 and 10's should be reserved for movies which are completely innovative. I felt like I saw this movie 20x already, and nothing kept me hanging on to find out what happened next. People who voted this 10/10 possibly need to experience movies such as the shining, Eternal sunshine of a spotless mind, Fight Club or even Wall-E. These are movies which provide the watcher with a different experience then what they are accustomed too, and they are left wondering what will happen next.",5.0,Anonymous,0.0008,0.9992,-0.9984,"Action, Crime, Drama"

A matter of fact, this way over hyped pile of garbage is one of the worse movies i have seen in years. Where to begin. Lets start with the so called great acting. You must be kidding me. Ledger does not deserve an Oscar nomination for this. If anything, Jack Nicholson does a far better job playing the Joker. Christian Bale basically mumbles through most of his Bat man parts, and isn't much better when he isn't. Plot is stupid as heck. They make the Joker sound like some super human beast from another world. A dozen officers with machine guns would of killed him off in 2 seconds. But i guess that would of ruined the story line.

Perfect blend of action and a Thriller,"""Batman"" isn't a comic book anymore. Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is a haunted film that leaps beyond its origins and becomes an engrossing tragedy. It creates characters we come to care about. That's because of the performances, because of the direction, because of the writing, and because of the superlative technical quality of the entire production. This film, and to a lesser degree ""Iron Man,"" redefine the possibilities of the ""comic-book movie.""""The Dark Knight"" is not a simplistic tale of good and evil. Batman is good, yes, The Joker is evil, yes. But Batman poses a more complex puzzle than usual: The citizens of Gotham City are in an uproar, calling him a vigilante and blaming him for the deaths of policemen and others. And the Joker is more than a villain. He's a Mephistopheles whose actions are fiendishly designed to pose moral dilemmas for his enemies.The key performance in the movie is by the late Heath Ledger, as the Joker. Will he become the first posthumous Oscar winner since Peter Finch? His Joker draws power from the actual inspiration of the character in the silent classic ""The Man Who Laughs"" (1928). His clown's makeup more sloppy than before, his cackle betraying deep wounds, he seeks revenge, he claims, for the horrible punishment his father exacted on him when he was a child. In one diabolical scheme near the end of the film, he invites two ferry-loads of passengers to blow up the other before they are blown up themselves. Throughout the film, he devises ingenious situations that force Batman (Christian Bale), Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) and District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) to make impossible ethical decisions. By the end, the whole moral foundation of the Batman legend is threatened.Because these actors and others are so powerful, and because the movie does not allow its spectacular special effects to upstage the humans, we're surprised how deeply the drama affects us. Eckhart does an especially good job as Harvey Dent, whose character is transformed by a horrible fate into a bitter monster. It is customary in a comic book movie to maintain a certain knowing distance from the action, to view everything through a sophisticated screen. ""The Dark Knight"" slips around those defenses and engages us.Yes, the special effects are extraordinary. They focus on the expected explosions and catastrophes, and have some superb, elaborate chase scenes. The movie was shot on location in Chicago, but it avoids such familiar landmarks as Marina City, the Wrigley Building or the skyline. Chicagoans will recognize many places, notably La Salle Street and Lower Wacker Drive, but director Nolan is not making a travelogue. He presents the city as a wilderness of skyscrapers, and a key sequence is set in the still-uncompleted Trump Tower. Through these heights, the Batman moves at the end of strong wires, or sometimes actually flies, using his cape as a parasail.The plot involves nothing more or less than the Joker's attempts to humiliate the forces for good and expose Batman' secret identity, showing him to be a poser and a fraud. He includes Gordon and Dent on his target list, and contrives cruel tricks to play with the fact that Bruce Wayne once loved, and Harvey Dent now loves, Assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal). The tricks are more cruel than he realizes, because the Joker doesn't know Batman's identity. Heath Ledger has a good deal of dialogue in the movie, and a lot of it isn't the usual jabs and jests we're familiar with: It's psychologically more complex, outlining the dilemmas he has constructed, and explaining his reasons for them. The screenplay by Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan (who first worked together on ""Memento"") has more depth and poetry than we might have expected.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9979,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Masterpiece of Modern Cinema,"In the realm of superhero movies, there exists a pinnacle of excellence that stands head and shoulders above the rest: Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. Released in 2008, this film not only redefined the genre but also transcended it, delivering a gripping narrative, stellar performances, and thought-provoking themes that continue to resonate with audiences worldwide. As an ardent fan of The Dark Knight, I am thrilled to share my enthusiastic review of this cinematic masterpiece.From the moment the opening scene unfolds, The Dark Knight captivates viewers with its atmospheric cinematography and haunting score. Nolan's Gotham City is a gritty and realistic backdrop, evoking a sense of urban decay and moral ambiguity. This serves as the perfect setting for the complex character dynamics that drive the story forward.At the heart of The Dark Knight lies the conflict between the iconic hero Batman, portrayed with unparalleled gravitas by Christian Bale, and his enigmatic adversary, the Joker, brought to life in a chillingly mesmerizing performance by Heath Ledger. Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of legendary, as he embodies the chaotic nature of the character with an intensity and unpredictability that is both captivating and unnerving. Every scene featuring the Joker crackles with tension, as he challenges Batman's moral code and pushes him to his limits.But The Dark Knight is not merely a showdown between hero and villain; it is a deep exploration of the nature of heroism, justice, and the human psyche. The film delves into complex themes such as morality, sacrifice, and the blurred line between good and evil. Batman, burdened by the weight of his crusade against crime, must confront the darker aspects of his own identity as he battles against the Joker's nihilistic worldview.One of the most compelling aspects of The Dark Knight is its examination of the concept of chaos versus order. The Joker represents pure chaos, an agent of anarchy who seeks to disrupt the established order and expose the hypocrisy of society. In contrast, Batman embodies the ideal of order and justice, striving to uphold a sense of morality and stability in the face of chaos. The dynamic between these two opposing forces drives much of the film's narrative tension, culminating in a series of gripping confrontations that challenge both characters on a fundamental level.Beyond its thematic depth, The Dark Knight also excels in its technical craftsmanship. Nolan's direction is masterful, with each scene meticulously crafted to build tension and suspense. The action sequences are pulse-pounding and adrenaline-fueled, showcasing Batman's prowess as a formidable crimefighter. The film's visual effects are seamlessly integrated, immersing viewers in the dark and brooding atmosphere of Gotham City.Furthermore, The Dark Knight boasts a stellar supporting cast, including standout performances from Aaron Eckhart as the idealistic district attorney Harvey Dent, Gary Oldman as the steadfast Commissioner Gordon, and Morgan Freeman as the wise and resourceful Lucius Fox. Each actor brings depth and nuance to their respective roles, adding layers of complexity to the film's ensemble cast.As a fan of The Dark Knight, I am continually impressed by its enduring legacy and cultural impact. More than a decade after its release, the film remains a timeless classic that continues to resonate with audiences of all ages. Its themes of heroism, sacrifice, and the struggle for justice are as relevant today as they were upon its initial release.In conclusion, The Dark Knight stands as a shining example of cinematic excellence, a film that transcends the confines of its genre to deliver a powerful and thought-provoking experience. From its gripping storyline to its unforgettable performances, Christopher Nolan's masterpiece is a testament to the power of storytelling and the enduring appeal of the superhero mythos. Whether you're a longtime fan or a newcomer to the world of Gotham City, The Dark Knight is essential viewing for anyone who appreciates the art of filmmaking.",8.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9979,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Hype,"A good film but not the master piece every one is making it out to be. One word. Hype. Two face is wasted and his existence is only known by Gordon and batman in the end so why bother using (and wasting)his character?, was there any real point in Maggie Gylenhall? The ferry bit went on far too long (probably so they could give ledger more screen time), The batbike/pod thing looked really slow and spent most of its time spinning its wheels and looked like more of an excuse to release a cool toy tie in! and i could go on but you probably all agree but are too blinded by hype and the fact that ledgers dead to see that this is a pretty average film. Why was the scarecrow not arrested at the start of the film? How come the clear reference at the end of batman begins regarding the jokers existence is completely forgotten about in the next movie. I could go on but i'm sure you'll all realise when the hypes died down. In summery, too long, wasted characters, a bit of mis casting and what the f**k was with batmans ultra gruff voice! i nearly choked on my popcorn first time i heard him!

A Masterpiece in Superhero Cinema,"Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" isn't just a superhero movie; it's a cinematic achievement that elevates the genre to new heights. This film, released in 2008, remains a touchstone for what comic book adaptations can aspire to be, blending intense crime drama with the high-flying antics of Gotham's caped crusader.The narrative dives deep into the psychological battle between Batman (Christian Bale) and his arch-nemesis, The Joker (Heath Ledger). The plot is intricately woven, focusing on themes of chaos versus order, good versus evil, and the impact of one's choices. While the story follows Batman's fight against crime, it's the moral complexities and the descent of Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) into Two-Face that provide the film with its profound depth.Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker is nothing short of iconic. His performance is a haunting blend of menace and madness, earning him a posthumous Oscar and setting a benchmark for villain roles in cinema. Christian Bale's Batman is both vulnerable and formidable, grappling with the consequences of his crusade. Aaron Eckhart delivers a nuanced performance as Harvey Dent, whose fall from grace is both tragic and compelling.Nolan's direction is masterful. He crafts each scene with precision, from the chaotic bank heist opening to the intense interrogation sequence. His use of IMAX cameras for certain scenes adds an epic quality to the film, making it visually stunning and immersive. The film's pacing is relentless yet allows for character development and thematic exploration.Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the dark, gritty essence of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score amplifies the tension and emotional stakes of each scene. The music, especially the Joker's theme, lingers with you long after the movie ends.While ""The Dark Knight"" is nearly perfect, it's not without flaws. Some might argue that Bale's Batman voice can be distracting, and the CGI for Two-Face's scars feels slightly off compared to the film's otherwise grounded approach.Over a decade later, ""The Dark Knight"" still stands tall as one of the best films in its genre. It has influenced countless movies that followed, proving that superhero films can be taken seriously as art. It's a film where every element - from acting to direction, from screenplay to score - harmonizes to create something truly memorable.If you're looking for a superhero movie that is more than just action and special effects, ""The Dark Knight"" is essential viewing.

Greatest Batman of all time,"This film is a magnificent piece of work which will likely not be rivaled for years to come. The most well known antagonist in the Batman comics is undoubtedly the Joker, and Heath Ledger portrays the necessary insanity and sadism perfectly. Christian Bale as Batman leaves nothing more to be desired, and every shot of Gotham city fills you with the mystery and dread that you would expect from a city littered with crime. You can feel the sense that the city is not in a good state directly from the movie's beginning, and the Dark Knight of Gotham has to rise to the challenge. The entire plot line will pull you deeper into the movie. Every time that you think that a little scene is unimportant, there is sudden relevance to the bigger picture to Gotham. It is simply one of the best movies that I have ever seen, and I feel that DC did it right with The Dark Knight, not to say that earlier Batman movies failed to leave you wanting for more, as they all did for me.",9.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9979,"Action, Crime, Drama"

A Cinematic Masterpiece - 9.4 out of 10,"Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight,"" released in 2008, is more than just a superhero film; it's a profound exploration of chaos, morality, and heroism, wrapped in a gripping, action-packed narrative. This film redefined the genre, setting a high bar for subsequent superhero movies and cementing its place as a cinematic classic.At the heart of ""The Dark Knight"" is a complex narrative that delves into the dichotomy of good and evil, embodied by Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). The storyline picks up from where ""Batman Begins"" left off, with Gotham City experiencing a relative calm thanks to Batman's vigilantism. However, this peace is shattered by the emergence of the Joker, a criminal mastermind whose anarchic philosophy and unpredictable nature push Batman to his ethical and physical limits.Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of iconic. His performance is chillingly brilliant, bringing an unsettling yet captivating energy to the screen. Ledger's Joker is not just a villain; he is chaos personified, with no discernible motive other than to create havoc. His eerie laughter, erratic behavior, and philosophical musings about the nature of mankind elevate the character beyond a mere comic book antagonist to a symbol of anarchy. Ledger's untimely death shortly after filming added a poignant layer to his performance, which was rightfully awarded a posthumous Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.Christian Bale's Batman is equally compelling, presenting a hero burdened by the weight of his dual identity. Bale masterfully portrays the conflict within Bruce Wayne as he grapples with his sense of duty to Gotham and his personal desire for a normal life. This internal struggle is intensified by his relationships with his loyal butler Alfred (Michael Caine), his confidante Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), and his love interest, Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal).Nolan's direction is meticulous, blending high-octane action sequences with deep, philosophical inquiries. The film's opening bank heist scene is a masterclass in tension and sets the tone for the ensuing chaos. The intricate plot, co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, is layered with themes of sacrifice, justice, and the moral ambiguities of vigilantism. The narrative's complexity is matched by Wally Pfister's cinematography, which captures the gritty realism of Gotham City, and Hans Zimmer's haunting score, which heightens the film's intense atmosphere.One of the film's central themes is the ethical and psychological battle between Batman and the Joker. The Joker's taunting assertion that Batman's moral code is a weakness is a recurring motif, challenging the very foundation of Batman's crusade. This philosophical duel reaches its zenith in the iconic interrogation scene, where the Joker goads Batman with unsettling truths about the nature of order and chaos.""The Dark Knight"" also explores the impact of heroism and vigilantism on society. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), Gotham's ""White Knight,"" represents hope and lawful justice, but his tragic descent into Two-Face illustrates the corrupting influence of Gotham's darkness. Dent's transformation serves as a stark reminder of the thin line between heroism and villainy, a line that Batman himself must constantly navigate.Technically, the film is a marvel. The practical effects, including the unforgettable truck flip and the jaw-dropping hospital explosion, are executed with precision, eschewing CGI in favor of real-world stunts that lend authenticity to the spectacle. Lee Smith's editing ensures a brisk pace, seamlessly weaving multiple storylines without losing narrative coherence.""The Dark Knight"" is not merely a superhero film; it is a profound meditation on the nature of good and evil, the fragility of order, and the sacrifices required for true heroism. Its influence on the genre is undeniable, pushing the boundaries of what a comic book movie can achieve both artistically and thematically. Over a decade later, it remains a benchmark for filmmakers and a testament to the enduring power of well-crafted cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"

A naca review,", yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. ""The Dark Knight"" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9979,"Action, Crime, Drama"
An action movie. Nothing more,"When I read the enthusiastic reviews in Italy and I saw this movie ranked 1st in the IMDb's Top 250, I thought: ""It's strange, the other Batman (Begins) was not so brilliant, what's happening with this sequel? Is it really this masterpiece? Is it really in the same league with movies like 'Clockwork Orange' or 'Apocalypse now'?"". No, it's not in the same league. Not at all. When I saw it, my delusion was strong. It's a good blockbuster action movie, but nothing more. Let's see.The following comments contain spoilers. Be careful.The script is not so original. There are tons of action sequences, but what can I say? I've seen it all. I've seen the robbery made by violent people, fighting against the guards and killing each others (in all pulp tradition, since ""Reservoir Dogs""). I've seen the ransom in China by plane (""Spy Games""). I've seen those action sequences with cars and armored vehicles in all American movies. (And this Batmobile is really awkward). I've seen the killer who kills by chance (""No Country for Old Men""). I've seen the super-mega-sadistic-mad-chaotic-evil-serial-killer in action who creates dilemmas and plays with his victims (in ""Seven"" and in the ""Saw"" saga). I've seen it all: ""The Dark Knight"" is nothing new. And it's very predictable: you really can predict any sequence before seeing it. There are a lot of absurdities. The heroes could kill The Joleker dozens of times, but they never do it. Why? Are they retarded? The ""two ships dilemma"" (I don't want to reveal more about that scene) is not realistic at all. There are only a couple of surprises, but the 2/3 of the movie doesn't create any suspense. What about the actors? The only two heroes of acting in this movie are Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart. Heath Ledger, with his Joker, bears quite the entire movie. All the other characters became secondary. Aaron Eckhart is really powerful and he confirms his talent shown in ""Thank You for Smoking"". What about the others? Christian Bale is one of the most talented actors of his generation, but in this movie he keeps only one expression all the time, with or without mask. His Batman has no personality. Maggie Gyllenhaal is one of the most interesting (and underrated) independent actresses of the New Hollywood, since ""The Secretary"". But in this movie she can act only in few sequences and she has no chance to show her real talent. Morgan Freeman and Michael Cane are giants, but in this movie they barely appear. Finally: I've never seen so many waste of talent! The good side of the coin in Christopher Nolan's work is: his philosophy. It's really positive and constructive and all his movie is coherent about it. It's just like the positive answer to ""No Country for Old Men"" and to modern nihilism: in the Cohen's movie, Evil is the absence of values and it's unstoppable. In ""The Dark Knight"", Evil is again the absence of values, but it's a minority, not the rule. So, we can fight Evil and defeat it, with or without super-heroes. But all those themes could be and should be explored better. ""The Dark Knight"" explores nothing.",5.0,Anonymous,0.0008,0.9992,-0.9984,"Action, Crime, Drama"

The Noir Card,"Two things interesting about this for me. (I'll let others talk about Heath.)One is how much more of a comic book it is than a film. I don't mean that it is sillier or more fantastic, but that the values seem to be based on storyboards as panels. The implications are pretty interesting. All those Marvel productions are pretty much the same: the same level of fantasy, the same vocabulary of cinematic effects. The same slant from ""graphic novel"" framing to modern film traditions  which incidentally are less designed than are the accidents of common CGI compositing tools.This on the other hand is not cinematic. It makes it boring for me visually, but there's another result: the story. The story is not your standard long form arc. Its at least four stories concatenated, as if you would read a few pages and come back at the next lunch break. It rambles, it has real comicbook soap opera. I really do think of this as a comic book that accidentally finds itself in a film.That's as opposed to ""Sin City,"" which though based on a comic, and supposedly co- directed by the comic artist, is intensely cinematic, so much so you almost drown.The other feature for me: the handling of noir.Noir is all about how the viewer manipulates the action by viewing. It has permeated nearly every corner of film and most intelligent filmmakers try to play with it. It is the primary narrative tool we have to add depth by adding layers. The Nolans are intelligent filmmakers. While the film isn't very cinematic, the script is, in this regard.The novel trick here is the joker. Sure he is played well, and Ledger was becoming one of our foremost folded actors. But the thing works because the role was written to matter, and that's because he introduces a double noir fold. The watcher is in the film, and the watcher is ""writing"" the script regardless of any action that anyone in the film can take. Its classic noir doubled. The joker's key speeches even cover all the noir highlights: you have to ruin routine; you have to profoundly affect, even kill random innocents; you have to express an amazingly complex orchestration and make it seem capricious, accidental. You have to deny intent and complexity. You have to pretend to not be amused.All these things are embodied in what Ledger was given. This is very important writing, and if you know ""Prestige"" and ""Memento,"" even ""Following,"" you would have expected something like this. Even if the film isn't good as a film, the writing is, and that allows Heath to make a film within. Its why ""Clockwork Orange"" is so important.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,0.9944,0.0056,0.9889,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Dark and Dreary,"Although an average film, ""Batman Begins"" had a dark, brooding quality and got off to an interesting start about the origins of the caped crusader before turning dreary. Unfortunately, this followup takes up right where the previous one left off - still dark but also dreary and even sillier. The script is atrocious and the plot line involving Two-Face is unbelievably lame. The most interesting thing in this tiresome film is the mesmerizing farewell performance from Ledger. He is simply fun to watch as the Joker. All the other actors look bored, a result of Nolan's dull direction. At a length of two and a half hours, it seriously overstays its welcome.

The Dark Knight,"The Dark Knight is based upon the Batman characters created by Bob Kane and is a follow up to 2005's Batman Begins. I remember in some earlier reviews of mine this year that I stated that I didn't even know if I would end up going to see The Dark Knight. After giving Batman Begins a perfect rating on this site you are probably wondering why I wouldn't want to see a sequel to a film I enjoyed so much. Well, when I saw Batman Begins in the theatres I thought it had a lot of style, action and kept me compelled and entertained and I found it a really good time at the movies. Hence the perfect review I gave it three years ago. Then, I saw it again on DVD and I did not like it at all. The thrills and excitement were gone and everything that held up so well the first time had vanished and rather than seeing all the good things I enjoyed about it on my first viewing, instead on my second viewing I found parts of it boring and I started to have a few problems with the acting performances. I still kept the rating on this site to a 10 because that was my first initial reaction to the film, but after not enjoying the film much at all seeing it a second time and having been entirely sick and tired of all the superhero films coming out this year I really couldn't have cared less if I saw The Dark Knight at all. Then all of the really good reviews for the film came pouring in all over the internet and I kept hearing how dark and bleak this version was and I even heard of one critic who couldn't recommend the film because of how dark it was. This intrigued me because I have always been a fan of darker fare and the fact that family members saw the film and told me that I would really like it ended up in me seeing it. And to my surprise I thought it was as close to perfect as a superhero film could possibly get and I would most certainly call it a masterpiece. The acting was all top notch from every performer involved especially by the late Heath Ledger who played the role of the Joker. I have seen Heath Ledger in other films such as Brokeback Mountain, or I'm Not There and to play this role he isn't more or less playing himself, but instead going totally out of character and playing a twisted and menacing psychopath and everything the Joker says, does and the evil in his facial expressions show that he is a true terrorizing evil. All of this is perfected by Heath Ledger who gives the best performance of this year so far and I would compare his performance as the Joker to last year's best performance of Daniel Day Lewis as Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood. Day Lewis won an Oscar this year, so I see no reason why Heath Ledger couldn't get nominated, or even win the award in his memory seeing as he tragically passed away earlier in the spring. His performance was one of the best parts of the film. What was also so good about the film besides the top notch acting, direction and cinematography was it's story. Instead of being filled by non stop explosions, high tech gadgets and over blown self indulgent special effects, this film instead mostly focused on the characters and for each one involved we are driven deep into their minds to see the madness of the villains and the good and also troubled lives of the others including Batman himself. The character study here is so fascinating that anyone taking a sociology or psychology course couldn't help, but be interested. The story in the film had me drawn in from start to finish and I liked the menacing and dark tone to the film which I found all the more interesting and I liked how this film did not use formulas, or clichés and instead gave us a straight out story that you would not know how it ended till the end credits rolled. The Dark Knight really hit me and made an impression on me. Even days after leaving the theatre I 'am still thinking about the film and certain scenes and characters in it. This is what I call a powerful, thought provoking and stay with you film that is so good that it has almost a power to remain in your mind like this. The Dark Knight is a brilliant achievement and I will go as far to say that it is the best superhero film I have ever seen simply because it is not like other superhero movies and this is also the best mainstream film of the year so far and I hope it is not shunned come Oscar time.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9988,0.0012,0.9975,"Action, Crime, Drama"
"Why so serious, right?","""The Dark Knight"" is a movie that honors its title. Dark, twisted and complex, Christopher Nolan's latest wonder concerning Batman is a movie that sets a before and after in its genre and joins its perfect companion; its predecessor ""Batman Begins"". It had been a long time since I had seen so much adrenaline on a screen, but then again Nolan's Batman is what it is because it isn't just about the adrenaline.It's still daylight in Gotham when a masterful opening sequence (supported by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer-again-magical score) gives way for a robbery to take place; organized by a man who calls himself The Joker (Heath Ledger), someone we would instantly take as a villain. If normally villains don't call themselves villains in superhero movies, this one says a lot of things about himself. He loves to talk and share his life philosophy with everyone he meets; he likes to joke, of course; he likes to watch people suffer with or without him watching; he dislikes rules and he likes Batman.This last statement maybe more understood once you've watched the film, but there's one of Bruce Wayne (yes, Christian Bale IS Batman) many interesting conversations with Alfred (Michael Caine) in which they discuss the nature of The Joker, and the old man points out that maybe Bruce doesn't understand this villain in particular. There will be a moment of confrontation later in which the villain will tell the superhero: ""You complete me"". That phrase reminded me of the great movie ""Unbreakable"" is.But, actually, what is a hero and what is a villain? In Nolan's brilliant screenplay (written with his brother Jonathan, a usual collaborator), full of psychological insight, this is one of the issues that floats over our head as we get lost in the ever exciting action sequences, fights and things blowing up in Nathan Crowley's spectacular production design.""It's not what underlies you, but what you do that defines you"", a Rachel Dawes now played truthfully by Maggie Gyllenhaal told Bruce in ""Batman Begins"". Her words resonate, as Batman continues to fight evil with her, Gordon (Gary Oldman) and a new ally, the D.A. Harvey Dent (a superb Aaron Eckhart).Let's not forget that Batman is more human than any of the other superheroes of the comic books. In this film, he's never able to call himself a hero and he thinks of quitting; without knowing if he's the guardian the city needs or deserves. But in all this realness, to continue watching him fall, to see him using his gadgets and his vehicles as a pro, to see that intelligence may surpass a gun to win a little fight or to generate fire without the need of any explosive; is one of ""The Dark Knight's"" treats to the viewer.Another major treat for the viewer is the presence of a villain (or criminal, if you prefer, as The Joker refers to himself when he says the town ""deserves a better kind of criminal""-again the issue of deserving someone or not; a villain or a hero-) that equals Batman in human qualities. I don't mean that The Joker has principles we may admire (although many people will find inspiring things in his weirdness), I'm simply referring to the fact that he doesn't fly through the air or owns magic powers and he just uses what he has in hand to serve some kind of purpose.Heath Ledger steals the film (and will get an Oscar nomination, because dreaming has no cost) and makes a wonderful Joker, mainly, because he embraces this human aspect of the character Christian Bale understood so well in ""Batman Begins"". Without overacting, Ledger creates an individual that we can call a freak, because it's the first thing that crosses our mind when we meet him. He has all this makeup in his face and two scars; he has a lot of stories to explain the origin of these scars. Ledger tells every story convincingly, and leaves no room for the viewer to fully understand him. His character has no name, nor he possesses the background story we see many times with heroes and villains; however we get to perceive an amount of grimness in his look and we want to know exactly where it comes from. It's Heath Ledger's great acting what generates all this.The rest of the ensemble, as in ""Batman Begins"", is top-notch. Michael Caine is given more screen time and makes the best of it; so does the great Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman. There are surely many other perspectives in which the film can be viewed and discussed, and that reflects the very good piece Nolan has created; a movie that's profound in the best sense of the wordA word we don't use so much for comic book movies.AnywayBatman may not know if he's the protector Gotham needs or deserves, but ""The Dark Knight"" is undoubtedly the superhero movie the film-goer deserves and has been waiting for since its predecessor; a film that even someone who knows nothing about comics, like me, celebrates with a big smileWhy so serious?",8.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Oh My God!,"I've just been to see a preview screening of 'The Dark Knight'. Now, I'm no film reviewer/critic/whatever, but this film blew me away. Blah, blah, blah on all the performances, they were brilliant! Heath Ledger is a truly psychotic Joker! As one of his final performances, he will be remembered as a villain who thrived on kaos and mayhem. Maggie Gyllenhall, Christain Bale, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Aaron Erkhart all gave such Oomph to their roles. Technically, the movie was fantastic. With all the explosions you expect and the body count wasn't too high. May be a little too much for children under 13 to grasp. Go see it. Go on!

The Cinematic event of a generation,"There is a pantheon of movies that define a generation. Star Wars, The Godfather, Jaws and now, The Dark Knight. A cinematic masterpiece, the films 2 and a half hours are both too short, yet so immersing it seems like days. Not one frame of wasted celluloid was included. The cinematography was unbelievable with sweeping cityscapes and intense, explosive action sequences. The acting was also unbelievable; Between Heath Ledger's tour de force (which is definitely deserving of the Oscar buzz), Aaron Eckhart's tragic Harvey Dent/Two-Face, Gary Oldman's ever brilliant presence as Lt. James Gordan, and Christian Bale's intense and driven Batman/Bruce Wayne, everyone involved is absolutely stellar. However, what truly makes this film the cinematic event that it is, is the story. Truly epic in it's scope but always aware that personal tragedy is what drives it. This is a rare cinematic masterpiece in a time where summer movies have come to mean mindless fluff, this transcends the typical superhero movie to achieve something truly spectacular. Seeing this film was an experience that I will not soon forget and I truly hope others derive the same pleasure from seeing it that I did.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9979,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Over-hyped and Convoluted,"seems like the comment on the front page was written by someone who must of been paid by the studio, Jesus! It wasn't that good dude! Get a life or at least get out of Malaysia! The movie was trying to be too many things. It should of focused more on just being a action movie and not so much psychodrama! Heath was brilliant but Nicholsons Batman was also great. I couldn't see myself watching this again. Once was enough! And the Batmobile was down right bizarre. It didn't look like something created by a rich man like Bruce Wayne. I liked the performance of Eric Roberts as well as Heath Ledgers. I believe the last batman was better. 7/10as a followup on this day Aug 30th, 2011, I have watched the movie a few more times and YES it is a GREAT movie! If grew on me and even after I met Gary Oldman at a high-school football game and commented on how well this movie plays on repeated viewings because the acting is so good, he agreed.

not as good as all the hype,"I really wanted to see this in the theater;however, I never did last summer. Instead I waited till it came on cable, and after watching it; I really didn't miss anything by not going to the theater. I was rather disappointed because I was expecting this to be as good as Spiderman, but I don't think it was. I thought it was rather slow moving with sparse action scenes. I mean Batman on the chopper really wasn't that much action. A lot of films have had better car chasing scenes then that.And I really didn't think Heath Ledger was anything special in this. His role was just a lot of hype. Probably the best role was by Aaron Eckhart and the special effects with his face at the end.I also have to comment on Christian Bale's Batman voice. What was he trying to do?? He sounded like a chronic smoker with emphysema.FINAL VERDICT: It was good, just not as good as advertised.

Who needs 2 and a half hour superhero movies?,"Too long, too dark, and too serious. The darkness is unavoidable - but exacerbated by the length, and the fact that for a movie about a superhero, it is entirely too serious. No matter how hard we try, the idea of a superhero is still a bit crazy. Imagine Bill Gates or Warren Buffet as superheroes - it's silly. So why does the film take itself so seriously? Also, it seems that the Batman story slips to the side in parts, as though the film is intent on tackling too many issues all at once. This isn't said to be contrary - the movie can be legitimately difficult to watch. It's simply too long for the content. It's not a bad film - but it's not an all-time great either.",3.0,Anonymous,0.0016,0.9984,-0.9968,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Why so much hype?,"Okay, so they built a good villain in the Joker, but the plot was just a bit too unbelievable to hold together. I'm not going to add any spoilers here, but if you want a big-budget, action- adventure escape that totally relies on the rendering farms that had to handle all the special effects... and don't mind plot-holes the Hindenburg could fly through, this film is for you.IMHO, this film doesn't deserve all the hype. Look at reviews from people who ""hated it"" and see why. Once the hype has died down and people get over their brainwash to overrate this over-produced Hollywood crap, we should see ratings more in line with the film's true value. I didn't walk out, but that was because I had such high expectations. I'd hope to see this rated a '4', maybe even as high as a '6' by the average public. I'm rating this a '1' to try to offset the obvious shills and excessive hype. This is, by no means, ""the best film of the summer""... but in its favor, it does give better balance to the darkness of Batman. If it weren't for the growing trend in bucking the old ""feel-good Hollywood ending"" routine... if it weren't becoming cliché to kill off ""good guys"" and create characters with seeming hearts of gold, who turn half-evil, I'd say this film had something unique; but that whole scenario is now a formula for making a film armchair critics will say has ""depth""... pffff...Save your time and money and rent an old classic favorite that you somehow never managed to see.

I've Gone Batty!,"This movie has everything. The cameras, the sounds, the really cool characters. For me, it's one of few adventure movies worth watching more than once. And, of course, Heath Ledger is as awesome as everyone says. The characterization is so much deeper than the other films. We get to see multidimensional people with purpose, even if the purpose to to kill and maim. We care about what happens for a change and we go along for the ride. A small criticism is that it is awfully long and it takes so much time to resolve itself. Also, people do some pretty stupid things, considering what a threat this guy is.

One of the best films ever created. Hats down for the whole crew.,"The Dark Knight. Spectacular , stunning and amazing. Absolutely staggering, a film that is not going to be forgotten. One that actually shows a story as it was meant to be shown, and one of the most darkest, cruelest, and violent action-packed films ever created. With great dialogues in between the equally great scenes, taking the film to another level of greatness.The special effects were all done in a simple, non shabby way, the soundtracks were simply harmonizing with the picture, and the Gotham we knew is now gone, this is a darker and more corrupt place than in any of the previous films.Moving on to the acting. Starting off with the Dark Knight. Bale's performance was outstanding, no-one else has ever been as superb a Batman as he is. Him being split between righteousness and insanity, between what is right and what is wrong. An entirely different Batman, and Bruce Wayne, surpassing any of his other predecessors. Whilst those were more flat, two sided characters, the Bruce Wayne we face in The Dark Knight, is a totally different story.Two key people in the film were also Det. Lt. James Gordon, who was played by Gary Oldman, and Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent. They both gave a good, very believable performance. Same would go to the two characters in the supporting roles, Alfred and Luscious fox, being cast by Micheal Caine and Morgan Freeman. Whilst these all gave a good quality from themselves, I was not at all impressed by Maggie Gyllenhaal who played Rachel Daws.Whether these characters were played well or not, people just could not concentrate on them too much, and that is only because of the fact that Heath Ledger, as the Joker, simply dominated every scene he was in, he was the highlight of the whole film. This is no ordinary Joker we were used to, Ledger portrayed the Joker as someone with hate running through his veins, someone that killed for pleasure and someone who had felt a great loss in his past. A darker, sicker, and more evil Joker than any of the other ones in the previous films. Insane, corrupt and terrifying, with a laugh of a psychotic maniac. A perfect villain for the Dark Knight, one that truly completed, and challenged him through the whole story. Hats down for Heath Ledger.Now, not to give all the compliments for the fantastic job to the actors. I also have to compliment the Nolan brothers for an obviously marvellous screenplay and great directing. Not to forget for a large stack of brilliant dialogues. They make films immortal, in a way that they are never forgotten. It makes the difference between a quality film and a masterpiece. The Dark Knight is a masterpiece, amazing performances by the actors, with special mention on Ledger as the Joker. Bone-chilling scenes combined with action and drama, in Gotham that looks flawless, a huge city covered with darkness and insanity. The Dark Knight is a must see film.",8.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Not just the greatest superhero movie ever made. A fantastic crime-drama is at play here.,"The Dark Knight serves as both the title of the film, and as its final purpose (i.e., its a play on the phrase, ""White Knight."") At the essence of this film is an extremely simple story, complicated (rather enhanced) by a series of developments triggered by the introduction of said ""Dark Knight"" in the previous film. And their consequences.The core of the movie is Bruce Wayne - originally having intended to serve as a hero for a time - desperately clinging to the hope of Rachel Dawes, and her promise of waiting for him, in the last chapter. But her heart is elsewhere. On the flip-side; everything is troubled by the inner-workings of a clown-apparent madman without a purpose.Christian Bale is exceptional here; playing the role of both Batman and Bruce Wayne differently (one of the only actors to ever realize that in the role) and both are played with equal confliction and brooding, building on the same promise shown in ""Batman Begins."" Aaron Eckhardt, on the flip-side of the coin (pun intended), is the obviously-inspired presentation of Harvey Dent like Elliot Ness in ""The Untouchables."" He is doomed to misery and scarring, of course, from the first reel and - strangely - every scene with him in it carries that pre-established foreboding. Perhaps intentionally. And Maggie Gyllenhaal does well in a role that was poorly-written last time and difficult to really care about. In the end, he comes through and enhances a role that comes off bland on paper. The rest of the cast is exceptional as well. Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Eric Roberts all shine spectacularly in this ensemble cast.But the true star of the show is Heath Ledger. From the first reel of the film in which he leads a scene that starts the show with a bang, to the end credits; the actor and the man who was Heath Ledger is nowhere to be found. He disappears into the role with an intensity that you would not expect in - what is ultimately - a superhero movie. I have seen the film three times now and each time I notice something else in the performance. For instance, every line that he utters has a strange comical side of it. Whether its threatening someone's life, giving a rendition of his ""violent history"" or simply antagonizing Batman; every line is strangely funny and unnerving at the same time. Its also note-worthy that in performing a rendition of the iconic Joker far and away from his comic book origins; he ironically nails the best depiction of the Joker to date. Yes, surpassing even the likes of Mark Hammil.I found it interesting how they interweaved the Joker into the plot. Without spoiling anything; the Joker exists outside of the entire structure of the film and, truthfully, could have been easily removed and still maintain a tangible film. It almost reminded me of the intentional-writing on ""The Sixth Sense"" where (again, without spoiling anything) Bruce Willis' character exists in the movie with that same ""interchangeable"" involvement. This increases the entire scope of the Joker because, as a self-proclaimed ""agent of anarchy""; he even exists within the reel of film as the embodiment of chaos.Christopher Nolan comes through yet again. One of the things I was hoping walking in was that the movie would be more urban than ""Begins"", which was more wrapped up with mythology than action and deeing the Batman in action. This time, we start off running with Batman finishing some business from the last movie. He keeps the film on the brink Another interesting thing I noticed about the film is that EVERY character is developed by the end of it. At first glance, all of the characters, second-billing and less, comes off extremely cardboard cut-out and one-dimensional. Surprisingly, throughout the course of the film, each and every one of them have their little story arcs that flesh out their characters.Perhaps this is why the movie has an epic feeling that surpasses the vast hype surrounding it. Having seen it three times in the theater, and ""other places"" (*waves at the Internet police*) I find myself hard-pressed to find a legitimate gripe about the movie. I have been sitting here this entire time trying to find one - and I can't. It is a taut, hard-boiled crime-thriller and mystery that happens to have a superhero at the thick of it; which is exactly how a Batman movie should work. Most of the film is even strangely realistic, in an unsettling way.Probably the finest movie of the year and a legitimate masterpiece.****/****",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"
The Dark Knight Breaks Comic Book Adaptation Barriers.,"A new villain is in town and he's a homicidal clown known as The Joker. Batman must do everything in his power to stop him, while Harvey Dent takes the lime light as the new face of good.Not since The Matrix Reloaded have I been hyped to see a film. Where Reloaded failed to deliver on that hype, The Dark Knight soars with bright colours. Is it everything that a Batman fan wants it to be? Yes. Is it everything a film lover wants it to be? Yes. The Dark Knight takes you on a ride through action, suspense, humour and drama. It rests in a genre that makes you suspend a little reality. This is the comic book world, where there are green monsters, flying men in tights and teenagers swinging around in New York. Very bright, very over the top and very fun. The Dark Knight turns all of this on it's head and delivers a raw, realistic and genre defining film. Along with Iron Man, The Dark Knight sets a new standard for comic book adaptations.Without a doubt, every review the one will read will praise the chaotic energy that Heath Ledger gives in the role of The Joker. Can a role really live up to such hype? Yes, and this is it. Heath Ledger goes where many people do not. He becomes the character, he becomes the Joker. Nicholson played the part well, but Ledger embodies it. Every little quirk, from the flicker in the eyes, raising the eyebrows or using his tongue to wet his lips, draws you into the character. It's safe to say the Ledger does indeed steal the show from everyone and the film knows this too. It's a shame we will never see where Ledger career would have gone, because this role is juicy and Ledger nails it.That's not to say that everyone else isn't good either. Bale brings more tragedy into the heart of both Bruce Wayne and Batman. Even with the world around him crumbling down, he still stands for good. Michael Cain reaches more depths with simple looks in his eyes. Both Alfred and Fox have moral dilemmas in this film, both play them well. Oldman has more screen time here then he did in Begins and he takes the character of Gordon to new heights. We know him as a good cop that doesn't conform to the corruption, but here his range explodes into more emotional decision making. Aaron Eckhart has the most troubling task here. He must play two completely different roles, within the same character, and we have to believe the transformation. His anger and hate mixes well with his confusion in what to do after his 'accident'. Finally Gyllenhaal, replaces Holmes. The character finally has some more range, but Gyllenhaal doesn't get enough screen time to bring it to us. Again, it's sad to say but this is the weakest link. It may just simply be the character.Everything about this film hits the nail on the head. The acting is top notch, no longer are roles in comic book films cheesy or one dimensional. These character are psychotic, dangerous, funny, defenseless and everything more you can ask for. Back when these characters could never be taken seriously, now are awing us with their presence. The script is fabulous. Every line of dialogue spoken by The Joker is chilling, now times that by ten because Ledger somehow gives the lines more chills. The action sequences are entertaining. We have car chases, fight scenes, race against the clock bits and anything else The Joker can come up with. With ever scheme he tops himself in the absurdity and craziness. More action then it's predecessor, more drama, more villainous and more dark. This isn't your Adam West Batman. This is Nolan's Batman.Nolan has recreated what once was lost. When nipples and bad ice puns were where these characters were, now are set back in the right motion. Nolan has given us, not only the best Batman movie, but the best comic book movie. You don't need high theatrics to create a great comic book film, you need substance. The Dark Knight has boatloads of this. I found myself wanting more of the Joker, I was so enthralled by the character and the performance. I found myself in awe of where the film goes, in terms of plot and character development. I applaud Nolan for not making a happy go lucky film, but for given The Dark Knight his true colours. He's a tormented soul, the events in this film push him to the limit, to his breaking point.There are some minor setbacks though. I wasn't too thrilled with the bits in Hong Kong. Trims here and there could have saved the running time, which clocks in at 2 hours and 30 some odd minutes. As well as too many scene where the camera decides to spin around the characters a couple times, it gets a tad annoying.The Dark Knight will break barriers. Comic book films will be more serious, more character and plot driven then CGI laden. Heath Ledger will earn an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of a sick and twisted clown. People will want to see what happens in this world and the people in it. The Dark Knight does create a new world, a world of fear and excitement. Where in some cases you kind of secretly want to root for the bad guy. This is a world I applaud, this is a film that I applaud. This is a perfect example of what a film should be.",9.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"

I hated this trash,"Glad to see I'm not the only one who didn't like The Dark Knight. I can step back and objectively say it was a ""good"" movie on some levels, the performances, over-the-top entertainment, etc. But the bottom line is I hated it. Loud, obnoxious, pointless, and soulless. Who are these awful people? Heath Ledger immersed himself into the role of the Joker, and it was impressive. He's fascinating to watch. But what is the point of his character? At least Jack Nicholson was humorous in the role, Heath's joker is just a train wreck psychopath with absolutely no redeeming value. I don't get the point. Why do we find these despicable characters entertaining, are we that desperate?I was disappointed in Christian Bale too. He is one of the best actors working today, but this time he was kind of flat. I thought he was better in Batman Begins. This entire movie is just so over-the-top: explosions (wow an explosion, that's new), the cool looking but ridiculous motor-cycle, the millionth chase scene, repulsive characters like Two-Face, and on and on. We've seen it all so movie makers have to go to extreme lengths to entertain us jaded moviegoers, and this loud, obnoxious trash is the result. We really are getting desperate.I usually agree with IMDb more or less, the ratings are usually reliable. But right now this is #5, come on could we please settle down on the hyperbole with this movie? I'm not hating it on purpose because of the hype, I liked Iron Man and that got hyped, I liked the Wrestler and that got hyped.

Over-hyped thats for sure..,"Don't let the title mislead you, I am not going to bash the movie, actually this movie is good, only that the hype over the internet(Heath's death and the Batman fan-support) effected the movies overall rating too much.I said this is a good movie. But is it the best ? Not even close. In its own category, it dominates most of the movies though, probably as good as Ironman and better than the first movie. Like most of the people, I am satisfied with the film but there are a few criticisms that I can make, about the fighting sequences, jokers screen time, and the process of the movie.First I wonder, why this film isn't called ""Joker""? Not only that Heath overshadows everyone with his performance, he also has incredible screen time as well, it is as if we are watching Joker as the main character, everything revolves around him. Maybe It was because there were too many characters in the movie, with separate goals and purposes, which also effected the process of the movie in my opinion. The story sometimes advanced too slow and sometimes too fast(but too fast in general) not allowing you to digest the theme fully.One other thing is the fighting sequences, the careography was not well made, most of the time it was too blunt, too dark and because of that, hard to perceive. Maybe it was the directors intention, but it kinda disturbed me, not being able to understand what was going on.To sum up it, the movie was just like I expected, but obviously below its hype, with a few deficiencies, a good movie in overall but definitely not a master piece.",8.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"
It's no definitive masterpiece but it's damn close.,"No words can quite aptly describe the dark, sinuous genius of Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"". A sequel to the 2005 ""Batman Begins"", the film defies the industry cliché of being a shameless exploitation of a franchise.Much has already been said about Heath Ledger's electric performance as the demented Joker and little else can really be said. It's a performance that displays every psychological tic with sadistic glee and Ledger, virtually unrecognisable behind both the makeup and the mannerisms, imbues his character with terrifying insanity.Of course, Ledger is just one of the many gems in a fine cast. Christian Bale is predictably good in the titular role but he's overshadowed by some other key players. Maggie Gyllenhaal is good as are Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman but it's Aaron Eckhart who gives a truly amazing performance as Harvey Dent, Gotham's idealistic DA and the city's moral centre. Eckhart's innocuous golden boy looks belie his dramatic finesse and he conveys the duality of Harvey's character and ideals with great deft.The high calibre of the cast is reason enough to go see the movie but it's the screenplay, written by the Nolan Brothers, that allows ""The Dark Knight"" to become more than just an adequate sequel. For all the cartoonish connotations of its comic book origins, the movie is a rich and fascinating study into the machinations of justice and humanity. In a genre of such formulaic conventions where ""doomed romance"" and ""final showdown"" are automatically entrenched in the storyline to inspire the same old message and emotions, it's hard to find some new ground. ""The Dark Knight"" succeeds, however, in toying with these very conventions and while the message that it sends is as subtle as an anvil crashing on your head, it's surprisingly powerful.Say what you will about the hype and about the free publicity that Ledger's death has earned this film but to credit it's commercial or critical success so cynically would do both the actor and this film an injustice. At the end of the day, ""The Dark Knight"" is brilliant entertainment with some phenomenal performances.It's no definitive masterpiece but it's damn close.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"
A Sign of Hope,"Wow. How else could I describe this movie? I was wondering how this could possibly better than Batman Begins, but the truth is it was a different type of a movie. Yet it still held those morals of righteousness, faith, ethics, responsibility and so on, it was just presented in a different way.The acting was amazing overall. Maybe not every individual performance was first rate but as a whole the cast was among the best ever. Christian Bale, who is undoubtedly the best Batman ever and probably the best superhero ever, like in Batman Begins, provides a deep and thought provoking performance. One with authenticity, validity, purity and most of all originality. His performance is subtle yet compelling, it is not by what we as a culture would like to think of as heroic but in my thinking that is exactly what it is. Unlike every other superhero he does not have superpowers. He is an intellectual who needs to rely on his and his friends' intelligence in order to do what he does. He is not an actual ""superhero"" he is a man. A man with the audacity to do what is always right even when no one else would do so. Bale throughout is able to display the turbulent lifestyle he lives in and how at times he ""The Batman"" himself has to question his own morality.The best performance of the movie though was not Bale's its Heath Ledger's. Like Bale he brings originality to a comic book character. It seems though that in every comic book movie the villains are never quite as unusual or scary as they should be. Ledger in this movie is able to pull off what repeatedly other actors have failed to do as comic book villains, give you that bone chilling feeling. Entirely throughout he brings intensity beyond intensity. His performance is so capturing and disturbing that he makes you laugh out of sheer horror, something that you rarely feel while watching a movie. The most frightening part about the way he portrays his character is not his freakishness, it's that his performance is not the least bit cartoonish, it is in fact very real. His performance is just beyond words.Aaron Eckhart was quite a surprise to me. We basically saw the rise and fall of his character Harvey Dent. The way he transformed from an incorruptible district attorney to a vengeful bloodthirsty maniac was simply perfect. Gary Oldman I was not surprised by though. I have always thought of him as a talented actor and unlike Batman Begins he is able to give a more serious portrayal of James Gordon and did as well as I expected and more. Maggie Gyllenhaal was a godsend compared to Katie Holmes. She seemed more fitting in the role of a lawyer and was able to pull off many scenes Holmes probably could not. Michael Caine is perfect for the role of Alfred. Alfred is more than a butler of Batman he is a friend, a father figure and righteous man. Who better than for Michael Caine with his great voice to portray such a character? Another actor with an even better voice is Morgan Freeman. He may not have had a large amount of screen time but he was certainly never a forgotten figure at any point in this movie.The writing was very good. Christopher and Jonathan Nolan are among the best writers currently and once again show off their talent. What is so interesting in the way that the script was written was that it did not aim to make anyone the star of the show. This script brought the best or should I say the most intriguing traits out of every character and actor. Everyone in this film had their moment to shine which was very satisfying to see. Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Aaron Eckhart, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman all deservingly so are allowed to not just be in this movie but a part of it. Not once have I thought ""oh I wish I could have seen more of this character and less of that one"". The writing was the glue to this movie and should be given more credit.I am now much more comfortable with saying that Christopher Nolan is currently the best director. He in the past has done great movies such as Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins and The Prestige. This movie was a perfectly crafted and is probably one of the best made movies ever. He is able to do something that most directors, including the great ones, cannot do. He can keep you well engaged into a movie and still provide some sort of a deep meaning at the same time. At no point in this movie did I ever wonder what time it was or how much longer is left. That something I could say I have never done. What other director in the past has brought out depth from a superhero? The answer is no other has. He maintains an authentic feeling that you would get from watching The Godfather and still excite you like your watching Die Hard. His direction in this movie is more than special it is a monumental achievement in film.Now what do I mean by a sign of hope? It not only has its hopeful and inspiring message saying that we have the power. It says that society doesn't have to determine who we are. That is not even it though. Over the years now summer blockbusters have become mostly shallow and superficial. This maybe one of the biggest blockbusters ever but it has something that the others did not have: true, deep meaning. Hopefully this movie can be an example to the rest of Hollywood. Maybe just maybe Hollywood can do something that it has not done for years; incorporating thought provoking, deep philosophical themes consistently back into their summer blockbuster commercial movies.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"
A Super Hero for Adults and Kids Alike,"Finally, a super-hero film for adults. Avoiding the cartoon-style exploits of such super-heroes as Superman and Spiderman, director Christopher Nolan has fashioned a sophisticated, but hugely entertaining, take on the equally impressive Batman. ""The Dark Knight"" is witty, intelligent, and fast paced. The action scenes and effects are spectacular, but do not dominate or overwhelm the film. Nolan does not linger over gratuitous explosions and lengthy chases. When a scene has communicated its purpose, he wisely moves on. Despite the film's 2½ hour running time, the movie seems tight and has little excess.Although Batman has no Robin, he is surrounded by a fine group of villains and supporters. Michael Caine underplays the quasi-butler, but delivers some amusing lines, and Morgan Freeman is solid and reassuring as another of Bruce Wayne's employees. Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman ably hold up the public servant side of the equation, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is fine as Rachel Dawes, although few demands were made on her talents. In the central role, Christian Bale is a fine Bruce Wayne/Batman. His icy-perfect face and pumped-up body are physically all that a Batman should be. Yet beneath the glossy exterior, he manages to breathe life into the crusading vigilante. Then, of course, there is the late Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger's performance steals every scene that he is in. Behind a crude childish makeup, he is at once demented, evil, funny, and over-the-top entertaining. However, even when he is delivering a humorous line, the villainous edge remains. When Ledger flicks his tongue, plays with his hands, or rolls his eyes, he captures the audience and holds them with his magic.Future super-hero films undoubtedly will be measured against ""The Dark Knight."" From Batman's stylish costume, his motorcycle, and the Batmobile to the dark, glistening cinematography, the stylish art direction, and the state-of-the-art special effects, the film rarely falters. With a sterling cast and a gifted director, ""The Dark Knight"" sets a new standard for summer action flicks. At last, a comic-book super-hero film that will not only grab the key pre-teen male audience, but also bring in discerning adults who may never have read a comic book or attended a movie in the summer. Way to go, Batman.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9979,"Action, Crime, Drama"
TDK review,"Bravo! finally, this truly was a quality film, the acting, directing and writing, this film is like something you've never seen from a superhero / comic book adaptation films.Let me start with the acting, Heath ledger... everything has already been said about this performance, yet he still managed to surprise me, what a performance, hat's off, he really does get under your skin, created (togather with writers of course) the perfect joker, or at least the one i wanted to see, dark, psychotic and a maniac. Aaron Arkhat (or however you spell his name) also gave a strong performance as Hearvy Dent, and the other cast was pretty solid.The script is just great... this is truly one of the best films if not the best that portrait the battle between good and evil, between what right and wrong, and about making the right choices.Now, retrospectively, i am really disappointed with the trailers for this movie, they composed different sentences to give it a more intense feeling and gave a lot of the action in the movie... sure they were great, but also gives you high expectations for this movie... and i hate coming to a movie with high expectations, so a little let down in that aspect. and yes 2 hours and a half did feel a bit long.That been said, TDK is a fantastic movie (sure it has some flaws, but what movie doesn't) its well written, directed and acted, action packed and even epic in a way only time will make it.Overall this is a MUST SEE movie for anyone that has a little sympathy for movies.9.7/10",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9979,"Action, Crime, Drama"
"Good movie, even if you aren't a fan of Batman","I have never been a big fan of Batman. I went to see Batman Begins when it first came out and haven't seen it a second time.I saw The Dark Knight, and I thought it was a very good movie. Because I don't know a lot about Batman, a few points were a little hard to follow. Overall, though, you wouldn't have to see the first movie in order to understand, or really have seen the cartoons or read the comics, either.As others have stated already, Heath Ledger's performance was incredible. He's portrayal of The Joker was extremely creepy and psychotic, adding humor to his morbidity.

An eerie score, brilliant directing, and spot on acting. There isn't too much that I feel comfortable saying about this film that hasn't already been said a thousand times, and wouldn't give anything away. I will tell you that The Joker is incredible. The trailers (thankfully) don't really give away too much of Heath Ledger's incredible acting, so I recommend seeing it for yourself. A lot of people are complaining about the length of the film, but the film covers a lot of ground and shortening it would be murder.

"Self-important, over-dramatic, uninspired.","It's hard to say that the Dark Knight is a bad movie. After all, it's well acted, well directed, and deals with some heavyweight, complex social and ethical issues.Problem is... is that what you really wanted to see? A drama? A deadpan, straight-faced, humourless, mostly action-free drama?I like dramas... I really do. Some of my favourite movies fall under the drama umbrella - Shawshank, Shine, Goodwill Hunting, Once were warriors, American History X, The Assassination of Jesse James, Ondskan...But lets be honest with ourselves shall we? We're sitting in the theatre watching a movie about a billionaire vigilante in a caped bat costume fighting a green-haired clown. How much drama/realism can you truly inject into that mix before you lose any and all sense of good entertainment?Sadly, not this much. And I'm at a complete loss as to how this movie got such a high IMDb rating (9.4 at the time of writing).

Has the world gone insane?,"This is my big question as of late when reading the rave reviews for this super-overrated trash heap. When people start comparing this to REAL masterpieces like ""Lord of the Rings"", thats where i have to draw the line. i mean seriously what the hell is wrong with these people. thankfully I'm not alone in feeling this way. and its a shame because I've been a batman fan all my life, ever since i first saw the brilliant 1989 Batman with Keaton and nicholson, 2 of my favorite actors. the film was and is magical. it defined what a Comic Book movie should be. i saw and loved all of the subsequent sequels, except the 4th film, obviously. and yes i love Adam wests hilarious portrayal as well. but even that 4th camp entry with Ahnuld was more watchable then these new ones. yes, i will take my bat credit card (exp date: Forever) right to the bank before i will watch TDK again. now its sad because i cant say im a batman fan without having to explain to people why i cant stand the new movies. i constantly have to say ""oh i love the batman movies, the ORIGINAL movies, but not the new ones"". its gets tiring. on top of all this, the fans/nerds of these films have created almost a cult like following who seem to literally worship nolan and his *lack of* vision. hes no tim burton. he doesn't have the style OR substance. i saw Batman Begins and thought it was just OK, but disappointing. i saw TDK back when it first came out. i, like most everyone else, was bought by the hype. but after seeing it twice, i came to the conclusion that most fans will not agree with: THIS IS NOT A BATMAN FILM. call it a crime drama. call it a Heat remake, but please don't have the nerve to call it a batman film, because its just not. more then that, its completely humorless and with not even a hint of comedy, unless you count the really stupid cop lines ""i didn't sign up for this!"" JEEEZ. thats bad. actually it was the lines that were unintentionally bad like ""NO MO DEAD COPZ!"". *rolles eye*.But what gets me is those that review this movie that its a great comic book adaptation. couldn't be further from the truth. a superhero movie to be good, has to actually at least somewhat resemble the comics. nolan looks to completely set his movies apart from the other ones that he completely misses the point and the fun of batman. ""i will make my batman feel smart and intellectual"". however all he does is make very long, boring, drab, serious movies that never acknowledge the fact that its about a man dressed in a halloween costume. thats what upset me more then anything else. it doesn't even have the word ""batman"" in the title! i think the director was playing it safe to an extent in the first one, which did at times feel more like a batman film, whereas this one felt like little more then an elongated episode of ""law and order"". look, i know CSI is popular on TV these days, but it doesn't belong in a batman film. when i think of batman, i think, BIG action, COOL batmobile, wacky, colorful villains and big bombastic musical score. BIG. every things gotta be big. thats what you got with the original films. this movie however is like batman on a budget. i could get this same lame average car chases from an episode of 24. but in a batman movie, every things supposed to be a heightened reality and more fantastical and like a comic book. pure escapism. but no, not this version. this is what I've come to call the ""dull"" batman. nothing about nolan's vision excites me, from the modern-day urban-grit makeover, to the facile 24 style anti-terrorist plots, to the uninspired flatly staged action scenes. according to most bat fans, nolan's is the best comic-book adaptation of all time, yet I can find nothing in these movies that is fascinated by its comic book sources and the films simply read to me as an uninspired extension of the modern ""realistic gritty"" action movie although it suffers by comparison from a lack of earnestness or gleefulness. not only is the direction all wrong, but its got NO good action scenes. what little action there is, is completely dull. batman rides that fugly tank thing to chase joker. he goes to hong Kong. nice. then he uses everyones cell phones (more stupid cell phone propaganda) to locate joker and then proceeds to get the crap beat out of him BY joker. then he rescues him! HAHA. the movie is so stupid. joker never got the beating he wholly deserved. the message of the film is disgusting and depressing, if you can even figure it out amidst all the constant psychobabble thats thrown around. two face was a write-off, reduced to a cameo, a footnote for what is usually a very cool villain. tommy lee Jones may have been a bit hammy, but he was damn entertaining! this version, like the film itself, is instantly forgettable. why is it taking everyone so long to take off the emperors new clothes? this movie is abysmal and the fact so many people enjoy it so much says something gravely disturbing about society. i think people need to wake up, go to church, rekindle there soul and get away from this overly serious mumbo jumbo. why so serious is right, only i want to ask the director that. these movies only inspire death and killings. you never heard this happening with the original batman movies. now look. pretty scary. but im sure this will only inspire holly-weird to make even MORE of these dark depressing soulless hype machines that will only inspire more killings and so on and so on.",,Anonymous,0.0005,0.9995,-0.999,"Action, Crime, Drama"
This is the summer of The Dark Knight,"Before ""The Dark Knight"" was released, I mulled over the uniqueness of Titanic's success. Perhaps not worldwide, but in the United States, Titanic's success was certainly unprecedented. Back to ""The Dark Knight"". Growing up, there had only been one movie that had enveloped almost every possible area of media before its release; ""Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace"". Rightfully so, because Star Wars was and still is the highest grossing trilogy in U.S. history. Until recently, that had been the most ""hyped"" film I have been alive to see open in the theaters. That was of course until ""The Dark Knight"".I remember my friends buying tickets 2 weeks in advance for the IMAX screening of ""I Am Legend"" in December, just so we could get the 6 minute sneak of ""The Dark Knight"". When the sneak of ""The Dark Knight"" was over, it was met with uproarious applause. Right then I knew this film was going to be special. And then came the unfortunate passing of Heath Ledger. But instead of deterring those to see the movie, the buzz surrounding his take on ""The Joker"" began to spread like the plague. And as the time approached for the film's release, words and phrases like ""Masterpiece"", ""Oscar-Worthy"", and ""Best of its genre"" began showing up in various media outlets. The controversy of Ledger's death, matched with this buzz of his performance, matched with the media dubbing this film ""Not to be missed"" made this the most anticipated film release in my lifetime. Much more so than any of the 3 Star Wars prequels.In closing, for those of you who haven't seen the film... In fact for those of you who haven't seen any Batman films... This film certainly lived up to its hype. Chris Nolan pushed the envelope for what is considered a ""comic book movie"", because unlike 99.9% of comic book films, when watching ""The Dark Knight"", everything in the movie is most certainly possible in the real world (perhaps even the bat-pod). So the movie plays off as more of a Crime-Action/Drama than it does a stereotypical Comic book flick. At the rate this film is going, it will at the least become the second highest-grossing film in U.S. history, and at the most, it will soar over Titanic.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9987,0.0013,0.9975,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Movie Making At its Best !!,"The sheer brilliance of this film cannot be described in words. The Nolan brothers have delivered one of the most riveting and powerful scripts in recent times with lot of technical panache'. This is a film that never lets go of its momentum right from the beginning and holds your attention till the most morally complex climax in a summer movie.Do not treat this film as a superhero or a vigilante story. It has lot more going for it. For instance one of the many ""Aces"" in the movie is the Joker - heath ledger. He owns every scene that he is in and it was good to see the rest of cast let him grab the center stage whenever he is on screen. The actor has set a tough benchmark with this role and he will be remembered for years to come.""The Dark Knight"" is as much a showcase of action set pieces as it is a classic story between good and evil and what happens when lines are crossed on both the sides to achieve their respective motives.Batman is a hero not because of the stunts that he performs or the fights he engages himself in but because the sacrifices he makes for the city he believes in. This is beautifully depicted in this movie and we feel for him when the movie reaches its pinnacle.There are lots of positives one can see within this 2 hour plus epic.In simple words.

Simplicity is beauty.,"The simpler it was the better it became.The movie just showed me what I need to do in oder to become like him. That's how great the movie was.

The movie's complex plot was a product good understanding of a simple story.I like the way Bruce Wayne was portrayed, a renewed man pretending to be a spoiled brat. This is just a good way to hide his true identity, by being what people expect him to be. Like the Art of War, when you are strong you pretend that you are weak. A true player of the system so he can continue with his work.The Joker in this movie is just great evidence of great acting. When you begin to see the character and not the actor, you begin to understand that Heath did a great job on the Joker. I remember the Joker not Heath.The movie's theme and music became my last-song-syndrome, great score by Hans Zimmer.

"Eh, it was good, but very overrated","Now don't get me wrong, I did like this movie. but really? Why does everyone think this is the most amazing superhero movie of all time? the movie dragged on for far too long and really wasn't as entertaining as movies like Spider-Man 2, Iron Man, or even the Tim Burton Batman films. In my mind, this movie doesn't hold a candle to those movies. the general plot was boring and way too serious, Bale's acting was horrible (He was much better in Batman Begins), and there was way too much dialogue. On the other hand, Ledger was amazing as the Joker, and the overall acting from the rest of the cast was good (With the exception of Bale and Aaron Eckhart. they were pretty bad in this one.) The action was great, although, at some points in the movie, I felt like I've seen it all before. over all, the movie was good, and I would've even considered it a classic at one point. but the overall hype of this movie seems to extinguish that notion from my mind. as I said before, it's a good movie, but not as amazing as people put it out to be.",8.0,Anonymous,0.9867,0.0133,0.9734,"Action, Crime, Drama"

"Let's be honest - They should just call this movie ""The Joker""","Let's get this out of the way right off the top: Heath Ledger is nothing short of amazing in this film. ** Heath Ledger's Joker makes Jack Nicholson's Joker look like Cesar Romero's Joker. ** Less cartoony and far more menacing, this Joker actually feels dangerous. Every moment he's on screen your eyes are simply glued there, just soaking in this iconic performance. His look, his mannerisms, his voice... they all come together to make the perfect Joker, and probably the best villain ever seen on screen in a superhero movie... or any movie, for that matter. It's really quite a shame Ledger passed away, as I would love to have seen him portray that character again and again.Does the rest of the movie match this level of excellence? Well, not entirely... It's got plenty of action, just enough humor, and a good script for the most part, but there are a couple minor things that bothered me slightly:If they have to recast Rachel Dawes, fine, but Maggie Gyllenhal is a big step down; Bale's gruff ""Batman"" voice still sounds a little over-the-top and almost humorous at times; and the movie takes a few unnecessary turns, especially towards the end. Much off this is due to the involvement of ""Two-Face."" This film didn't need a second villain. His time on screen does nothing but make the audience wish they'd hurry up and get back to the REAL villain. I've never cared for the character, and I suppose it's good they didn't wait to try to use him as the sole foe in a future film, but he simply didn't do anything for me. Aside from those aspects, however, it's difficult to find much to criticize in this movie.I struggled greatly with the rating for this one, as without The Joker, the rest would only have made for another above-average film like Batman Begins. But Ledger's Joker is undeniably the star of this show, and based on that performance alone, I spot it the higher rating. Forget The Dark Knight - they should just call this The Joker. Ledger simply OWNS this film.",8.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"
It's like a really bad joke - Please Read,"Batman. Pause and think about that character for a minute.
""The Batman"" is a guy in a spandex bat suit going around fighting crime, a superhero character from a comic book from the 1940's for young children looking for a bit of fun and a place for their juvenile imaginations to run free. His sworn enemy is ""the Joker"", a clown with clown tricks up his sleeve who's a villain.Where the earlier Tim Burton adaptations were fun and tongue in cheek, this here takes the Batman, the guy running around in spandex in a bat suit fighting off the bad guys... and makes an attempt at a disconcertingly, utterly serious film noir with an atmosphere about as dense as a horror movie, exceeding the 2hr30 mark. It's... like a joke, it's something akin to the concept for a comedy sketch one would have. To take something a bit ridiculous and light, and reverse its momentum in making it into this piece that takes itself completely, utterly seriously. It's a very common premise for many comedy sketches or concepts.The fact it was received so absurdly well by the greater public is, sadly, testament to how empty and strayed our current times are, that the common individual looks for a hero and ideals of greatness, epic drama, and meaning, in something like a 3 hour long horror movie/thriller version of Batman directed by Christopher Nolan. And this review doesn't even take into account the film from a technical perspective: too many characters, cringy silly scenes, way too long... etc",2.0,Anonymous,0.0021,0.9979,-0.9959,"Action, Crime, Drama"
A Triumph of a crime film (not just a simple comic book movie),"I was just afforded the opportunity to watch the newest batman installment The Dark Knight but not only did i get to lay my eyes upon a Nolan gift to the world, I saw it at 12.00pm and school was back in session.So without the constant ramblings of minors or the reverberating sounds of popcorn crunching I was allowed to fully appreciate what had been put to the screen.To say i was elated with the finished result is an enormous understatement but it is also something that does not come on like a flood. Some scenes once begun can seem like a simply and brainless action flick as ""spiderman"" is asked to chose someone's fate but the conclusion of each scene leaves you stunned as if you have just come to the twist in fight club and no one has spoiled the ending.It does not take much thought to see that this is a good film, but soon after the movie whilst you are sipping on your Mocha or catching the train home as I did, that you realise this is a great film. Morals are questioned and lines are crossed and these are all beautifully created by the Nolan brothers.They may not have the odd brilliance of the Coens or the VFX beauty of the Wachowski's but this brother duo are the new force to be reckoned with in theatre. The title says crime film and I stand by that notion because what the Nolan's put to screen is not a comic-book PG blockbuster. Within minutes you feel like you are watching another crime thriller even though the protagonist is dressed in a black Kevlar suit and the antagonist dolled up like a two-dollar hooker.The action/story is fast-paced and the editing very edgy throughout fight scenes keeping that sense that we are all just blind as bats as he moves amongst us.And now onto the performances, Without doubt one of Ledger best characters and I know that the former statement is already echoing like a poor cliché but it can be justified. It was not so much as what he said in the movie that evoked my 'endearment' but what he left to his body. His jerky movements and twitches as he almost seems uncomfortable in the trappings of his human body and then when he does open his mouth it amplifies everything that his body tells you. It is so easy to forget that this is in fact Heath Ledger, the man who sang to Julia Stiles in 10 Things I Hate About You, he simply is not himself and you can feel just how much he put into his performance because you truly believe that this man is mad.It goes unsaid that Morgan Freeman and Michael Cain both dominate in their particular roles especially in the case of Cain as he is given some wonderful dialog, which he delivers with perfect tone absolutely stealing the scene from anyone he is accompanying.Bale again shows the world what a real batman should be; torn, misguided, hopeful and terrifying but the one role that truly stood out in the film was that of Gary Oldman. Long gone is the sympathetic innocence we saw of his character in Batman Begins, as he gives rise to a powerful Gordon and a character that really belongs in Nolan's envisioning of Gotham. As i watched each scene with Oldman I thought that i was watching the likes of Keitel or Spacey, he took every opportunity to prove himself as a great actor and in each scene he intimidates the audience with his power.The main factor behind the re-birth of the Batman franchise is believability, Gone are the glo-paint and mo-hawks as the Nolan's give a haunting image of a world, our world, riddled with corruption in it's darkest hours before the dawn.Without hesitation i give this movie 10 stars as it is beautifully shot, encouragingly directed, impressively written and memorably performed. This sets a new standard for the comic-book movie, I wonder who can step up to the plate?",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"
"The Best ""superhero"" film ever","I am a batman fan. Not a fanboy mind you, I have read the comics, seen the other films, and like batman story well enough, but unlike a few of my friends, I haven't been following the release for this movie like a bloodhound. But thanks to above mentioned friends, I have been passively looking forward to it. So we booked our tickets, got to one of the first showings in the world (I live in Australia) and got ready to see a movie that could not possibly live up to the hype that has engulfed the world. I was so wrong, so, so wrong.This film stands so far above its predecessor it is on another planet. Nolans script is, like most of his movies, a complex and involving one. Unlike his some of his other films, the acting, story, cinematography etc all belong on the same pedestal. Never before have I felt the palm sweaty excitement of a gripping film take hold of me for a complete running time (and keep in mind this is 2 and half hours). The lack of CGI is one of the films biggest assets. The action feels gritty and real, involving you more than the graphics heavy iron man or Hulk ever did.Id heard talk of Ledger being nominated for a posthumous Oscar but had thought it a silly move, why give awards to someone who cannot accept it? But his performance is mind blowing, creating one of the best villains ever to grace the screen. I don't know if an Oscar is the right way to do it, but his performance needs to be acknowledged for the masterpiece it is. Id heard a critic call this the ""empire strikes back"" of superhero films, and it really is the perfect comparison. This film proves that some ""superhero"" movies don't belong in a little niche, to be weighed against each other, not the ""serious"" films, but can instead be acclaimed as deep, involving and above all exciting works of film-making.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9979,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Better than Begins,"Actually, first of all, I can't compare Batman Begins with the Dark Knight. They have different plot. Begins shows the introduction of Batman, the origin of Batman. The Dark Knight has a more darker plus interesting plot. It is commendable. Plus bigger action pieces, the movie goes in deep with humans' feelings. It is quite good and I understand it receives a lot of positive reviews. Christopher Nolan did a good job in everything in the movie, making the story deep and dark but engrossing.The story: The Joker is trying to destroy Gotham and wants to kill Batman at first. With his trick plans, nobody even Batman can find him or predict his next move. Batman must stop the Joker from further destruction of Gotham. From there, humans' emotions slowly rise. There are some big action pieces, plot that you want to know and electronic music. I am somewhat disappointed with Two-face aka Harvey Dent, considered the white knight. I wished that Two-face will be given a bigger role. Other from that, it is hard to see any faults with the movie. Acting is good, Heath ledger makes a good joker.Overall: It is good to watch this in cinema. The runtime although long seems to pass quickly. You won't be disappointed. The first scene features bank robbing to hype the audience. It, not only shows you that it has the big action, shows the bad and good of a human which is one of the thing in the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"

"Intense, Amazing, Near Perfection","When I walked out of the movie I was asked what I liked about it. ""Everything,"" I answered. Everything was nearly perfect about this movie: the action scenes were intense; the plot was easy to follow to enjoy the movie, but deep enough that it merits a small discussion with a group or multiple viewings; and the acting... my god, the acting was incredible. I found myself laughing out loud, not because the movie was particularly funny, but because Heath Ledger NAILED his performance in every scene.The Joker's character nuances were hard to miss and easy to love. After his first and second appearances in the movie I found myself just waiting for the next scene with The Joker. I've seen the movie twice now and can't wait to see it again just to see Ledger's acting.It's not that the other characters didn't do their part, because they did. As always Christian Bale delivered a performance that is hard to rival. Aaron Eckhart, I feel, has thrown himself into a realm where those who see this movie will be hard-pressed to forget him. I've always liked Eckhart, and now when I talk about him others will know who I'm talking about.The only complaint I had is that the movie felt compact. Yes, it was long; no, it wasn't rushed. I just felt like there was so much more story to be had. It's like when you're reading a really good book and you see the number of pages narrowing and you just don't want it to end.My thanks and congratulations to everyone who made this movie.

Just perfect. A must!,"My wife and myself, parents of three little kids, rarely get to go to the cinema. Two weeks ago, during our holidays, we got my parent to babysit the little monsters, so that we can finally get out again. Taking a peek into the papers (actually *real* papers, I had no internet access :-) ) revealed, that ""The Dark Knight"" was the only watchable movie playing in the small nearby town.Somewhat reluctantly, we decided to give it a try. What the hell, we thought, we are on holidays anyway, why not check a kids movie (sorry to all fans of previous Batman movies, but that's just what I think of them).BOY, were we surprised! After the movie, it took us a few minutes before we both burst out ""this is one of the best movies I ever saw!"" I won't go into any details, for the multitude of excellent comments on this board already presents this movie as it is: a MASTERPIECE! Especially the performance of the late Heath Ledger (Joker) was unbelievable (posthumous Oscar, anyone?) I actually felt quite nervous and actually even a bit scared during some Joker scenes - something I didn't experience that often in a movie theater! And yet, we both felt, that quite a few lines of his could have been from us... :-)It's a must, please go watch it either in a real movie theater, or in a DAMN good home theater. While the special effects in this movie are just what they *should* be (a mere vehicle to transport the message), the atmosphere of the movie just won't come over if you watch it on a 19"" monitor with your 5.1 headset on... :-) I'd gladly pay again to see it one more time!",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9977,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Joker darker than the Dark Knight,"I thought I would be disappointed after all the hype that surrounded the movie but I was glad that I was wrong. This movie rocks and by far the best movie in 2008. And I thought that Batman Begins was difficult to top! Heath Ledger gave the performance of his life. You really have to give credit to the man; he did came a long way from A Knight's Tale and 10 Things. His Joker was discomfiting, psychotic and confirms my suspicions about clowns! With his passing, it up the spooky scale a few notches. He held his own against the big wigs - well, I think he even surpassed a few of them. He has the best one-liners too! His lines spoke of chaos, death or the lack thereof. Art imitating life or vice versa. One wonders if he took his character a tad too far.To sum it all up, The Dark Knight has twists at every turn, exciting batmobile chases, cool new gadgets (and suit!), stellar performances, tight plots and witty script. This made for a very good summer movie.Go watch it or you'll be the last not to.

The Joker is Real,"Watching the various Batman incarnations over the years, from the Adam West era, through the Superfriends, Tim Burton and Friends, and the very excellent Bruce Timm Batman: The Animated Series of the 1990s, we are faced with various versions of the Joker.The Animated Series Joker was voiced by Mark Hamill, and is considered by many fans to be the best Joker up to now. He certainly is creepy, and in the film spin-offs he does actually murder people explicitly on occasion, but though he is good it's hard to imagine him existing outside of the art deco alternate universe of Bruce Timm. He's just not unpredictable enough. He has steady henchmen who trust him enough to turn their backs on him.Jack Nicholson's Joker was well-received at the time, but he too suffered from a believability gap, in addition to being over the top and, while crazy, not quite creepy.Enter the Dark Knight's Heath Ledger: the freak make-up, the crazy, but disturbingly lucid philosophy, the complete lack of empathy for other people, and the scary practice of killing people for fun and without warning, his fondness for knives. I can actually imagine running into a character like this in a city somewhere. Certainly, not quite as complete, the real-life version wouldn't have the smarts to pull off so many grand schemes along with all the pure evil traits (you hope), but there are a small number of people out there who share some of the Joker's characteristics, and that's what makes Ledger's character so creepy, so scary.Every scene he is in, accompanied by music that would feel at home in any Hitchcock or horror film, is filled with a sense of tension and dread. What horror will he next bring upon the people standing before him? Who's next? Without a doubt the best Joker ever, Ledger's performance did not feel at all like a comic book superhero movie bad guy. I was thinking more like Hannibal Lechtur. Intelligent, lucid, menacing, and, I'm convinced, not really insane, but horribly sane, with a tendency to view life as pointless and thus amusing.Oh, yeah, the rest of the movie? That was good, too. Eckhart's Harvey Dent was also very satisfying, with no campiness to bring it down. His trajectory from ace prosecutor to criminal Two-Face is very well-done. Bale, Caine, Oldman, Freeman, and Gyllenhall are all well-cast. The action is better than Batman Begins, with the fistfight scenes in particular being easier on the eyes, with less spastic camera motion. The writing and direction is more along the lines of a crime drama or an action film than a comic book adaptation, and the story starts off with action and keeps you going for the whole 2.5 hours.Very dark, violent, and very well-done film all around.",9.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9977,"Action, Crime, Drama"
An Unnerving Masterpiece that Requires Multiple Viewings.,"This is for those of you who are avid film watchers and take it very seriously. Others will only applaud this film as a wonderful work. Avid film watchers will gush.Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight'--well, frankly it tickled the bottom of my cockles. I'm very rarely tickled in that magically hidden place of pleasure (save for many random moments from my fiancé). After watching this film, I can't sum up my feelings for it in one review. I must see it again, and again. I wanted to see it right after I got done watching it, but all showings were sold out at the theater I was at.This movie will kick you in the teeth, figuratively speaking. If in an IMAX theater though, it will at least rattle your teeth as it is booming in those theaters.The acting is superb throughout. The directing, the lighting, the action, the set pieces, the script and plot are great as well. Ledger may be getting his just rewards for his portrayal of the Joker, but I feel the other actors are getting short-shrifted in their praise. They all do very well. Even the swat team members who really have no names in the movie.As for critics and their assertions about the movie? Too dark, too grim and depressing? No, not at all. In fact, it surprised me how far it didn't go in that direction. The graphic novels are a lot more depressing from time to time. A work of art? A masterpiece? Oscar worthy material? Yes. Yes to all three questions. More importantly though, this film is masterfully made work of love. Love for the source material. Love for film, and most importantly love for the human being.We can be soulless creatures every now and then. We can. When the chips are down, however, we show who we really are. Not schemers, not killers. We're human. We do what we have to in order for us to survive. When the chips are down, we will band together.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"
A Masterpiece of Tragedy,"Admittedly everybody walks out of a cinema, and the endorphins in your brain will be telling you 'That was the coolest flipping movie I ever saw!'The Dark Knight is simply a masterpiece. It builds itself up so many times, only to turn around and take you in another direction. Heath Ledger's much hyped performance lived up to all expectations, being both chilling, yet horrifyingly captivating. Where I live in Australia was lucky enough to be one of the first showings in the world, and I feel that many of the patrons in our cinema were there solely to see our lost son in his final performance, and it is a great lasting memory for us to be left with. The only minor qualm that I may have with this film is that the final cut is more about Heath Ledger than it is about the film's star. Christian Bale had noticeably less screen time than Ledger, why this is, I am not sure. The performance of the cast is, as you would expect from the stunning ensemble cast is remarkable. Old hands Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman bring the prestige and grace to the screen, while the new kids on the block (Gyllenhaal, Bale, and the outstanding Aaron Eckhart) truly knock it out of the park.If you miss out on this film, you truly are missing out, it is a modern classic.

Shouldn't Be In The Top Fifty,"This movie was very well done, but does not compare with most of the movies in the top fifty. Hype has built up this movie, coupled with the over-played fact that Heath Ledger overdosed on medication. While Heath Ledger made the character interesting, his acting does not compare with TRULY emotionally impacting roles. Compare his acting with Jack Nicholson in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". While Heath Ledger's portrayal was effective, the SCRIPT and the director made the movie truly effective. Also, this movie did not possess the intelligence of other Christopher Nolan movies. In my opinion, the best part of Christopher Nolan's movies has always been his manipulation of time. This is the first of his movies that did not make use of this. Movies like Memento and the Prestige made use of time to create a sophisticated twists and turns. These movies did not reach the rating given ""The Dark Knight"" due partly because their sophistication caused them to lose widespread popularity, and also because they were not hyped as large summer blockbusters. The widespread popularity of this movie, as well as undeserved hype, will eventually calm, and this movie will be pushed out of the top fifty.",8.0,Anonymous,0.9957,0.0043,0.9915,"Action, Crime, Drama"
A masterpiece - Likely to constitute a serious indictment on the Oscar system...,"First things first.This film is not a comic book movie. It is not an action movie. To reduce it to these archetypes would be completely unfair.To fairly represent this movie it must be seen for what it is - It is a dramatic suspense film that will keep you on the edge of your seat for the surprisingly long running time (surprising in that it goes by so fast, and also that the studio allowed Christoper Nolan to cut it this long) Batman Begins was seen by most to be a triumph in the comic adaptation genre. However, it did remain a comic adaptation in many ways.The Dark Knight goes beyond that. This film blows suspense up to a city-wide level, and raises the stakes to a breathtaking level. It recalls the suspenseful nature of films by the likes of David Fincher, Ridley Scott, and even the master, Alfred Hitchcock.It's crafted in such a way that each action seems both inevitable and unbelievable, and so even for fans of the comic book who believe they know where it is going, it is an astounding achievement.The film looks spectacular, thanks to Nolan's regular cinematographer Wally Pfister. Gotham city looks brighter, yet more ominous during the day, and danker and more dangerous at night.The performances are as spectacular as many had expected and/or hoped. Bale returns in fine form as the titular character, and can't be faulted too much. Eckhart debuts as District Attorney Harvey Dent, and the storyline effectively revolves around him and his war on organised crime in Gotham. There are fine supporting performances from the returning Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, as well as the newcomers Eric Roberts, Nestor Carbonell and Maggie Gyllenhaal (who thankfully takes over from Katie Holmes as Bruce Wayne's childhood friend Rachel Dawes).However, if the action centres on Harvey Dent, then the action IS Heath Ledger's performance as the maniacal Joker. In one of the finest film performances of the last decade, Ledger puts in what will end up being an unforgettable final (complete) performance that will have almost everyone buzzing about a potential posthumous Academy Award.I cannot reiterate enough - Not only is this film excellent, and highly enjoyable to watch, but it is of such a fine quality that it should really transcend the typical box created for films that are deemed to not contain the correct ""subject matter"". Much in the way Rocky transcended the typical ""sports movie"", so this transcends the typical ""comic book movie"" - It is much more than that, and should legitimately be considered come Oscar season. If this movie cannot earn some consideration by the Academy, they might as well come out and call them the Academy Awards for slow-paced, moody dramas, because this is the best film I have seen in a long time, and that's including the crop that were nominated for best picture last year.In short, go see this movie. If you, or your friends, or anyone you know has been excited about this movie to come out, then just know that everything that they were excited for is justified.Go see it - You'll enjoy it, because it's terrific. There's not much more to say.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9979,"Action, Crime, Drama"
"Ledgers good, but he's no Jack","I don't think I have ever seen a movie that has gotten as much hype as this one. I don't think even the 1989 Batman got as much publicity. Too much pre-hype can really hurt a film, I give Snakes On A Plane as an example. I saw it today and wanted to set down my observations. Yes it is a good film with a lot of action. I grew up watching the Adam West Batman, light hearted and campy. The title of this movie is accurate, they do make him as a dark night who has almost as much inner torments and demons as the villains he pursues! He has just not let the darkness overwhelm him. Like everyone else, I was saddened by Heath Ledger's tragic death and I think that might be one of the reasons for the raves about his performance, people see it with their hearts instead of their heads. The truth of the matter is that yes he does give a good turn as the Joker. He brought his considerable talent to the role and truly made it his own. However, he did not for one moment make me forget Jack Nicholson! That was one part Jack was born to play and Ledger was real gutsy to even try, but he didn't come close. Ledger was good but there is only one Jack Nicholson and he is the best. Sorry Heath, have fun in Heaven though.",,Anonymous,0.9987,0.0013,0.9973,"Action, Crime, Drama"

"Too Long, Too Little in Spite of Heath Ledger's Brilliant Performance","Unfortunately, this is a movie that just didn't know where to go most of the time. We have an almost three hour movie that really feels longer and doesn't know where to go and when to stop.First of all, let's talk about Heath Ledger's performance. The hype is absolutely justified. He lights up the screen with his performance and the film is delightful when he is on the screen. Part of the problem is that no other characters are equally as interesting and that includes Christian Bale as Batman. There is not all that much charisma in Christian Bale's characterization as Bruce Wayne and none of the other characters grab the screen the way Heath Ledger does, so the movie doesn't really give Heath Ledger much to play off of most of the time. Eric Roberts, almost unrecognizable probably due to the work that has been done on his face, has some acting moments in a minor role that cause a stir. I always liked him and wish I saw more of him.Meanwhile, the film has so many twists and turns that do nothing more than confuse, I felt more like I was in a maze that I couldn't get out of rather than on a roller coaster ride. Just when I thought there might be a resolution to the film, yet another plot twist, a new discovery would occur. I found myself looking at my watch after about an hour and a half or so, and the movie was only half over! The first part of the film, that is to say, the first hour, was more character setup and that was far more interesting. The first part of the film relied more on dialogue and there was quite a bit of evident wit. But when the plot points started getting laid on thick and heavy, I got restless and continued to get more so. At film's end, I ended up thinking ""So what?"". I was glad to have seen Heath Ledger's performance, but not much more than that. I felt, other than for Ledger, the film wasted my time (and money).",4.0,Anonymous,0.0006,0.9994,-0.9989,"Action, Crime, Drama"

I'll admit that I wasn't sure whether to go and this film at first as I'm not really a big fan of Batman and have never seen any of the other movies to do with Batman.I am glad I took the chance to go and see The Dark Knight because it was such a treat.The Joker was my favourite character (and not because Heath Ledger portrayed him). I found myself feeling sorry for the Joker and then not liking him and there has only been one other movie that has made me feel that way (The Godfather).Christian Bale was great as Batman and in my opinion they could not have cast anyone better for the part. Heath Ledger really did go out with a bang as he astounded me with his acting. The Dark Knight was truly his best role that he has played, well at least that's what I think.My list of favourite movies always changes but I know that this one will stay at the top for years to come.Hope my review helped.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9979,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Why So Serious?,"Why is ""The Dark Knight"" so serious? For many good reasons. Christopher Nolan is a true auteur who can take a simplistic comic book story like ""Batman"" and turn it into a complex psychological movie with plethora of character study. He has directed Christian Bale into the most serious Batman character of all. He sure did direct the late Heath Ledger into performing as the best Joker of them all, and Ledger did not work to upstage Bale or the other actors in any way. Ledger should definitely win a posthumous Oscar for his scary performance of a clown who possesses deep wounds.If Christopher Nolan was old enough, he should have done Batman movies instead of Tim Burton or Joel Schumacher put together. Tim Burton's mood was dark as well, but as I'm looking at it now, Michael Keaton was a more sloppy Batman, Kim Basinger was a mousy Vicky Vale, and Jack Nicholson overdid his Joker performance. In ""Batman Returns,"" also directed by Burton and starring Keaton, the commercialism continues, adding Michelle Pfeiffer as a more idiotic Catwoman than the Catwomen on the 1960s TV series and Danny DeVito, who still was a wounded Penguin, but not enough that we feel sorry for him. Then in the mid 1990s, Keaton didn't want to play Batman anymore, feeling he was upstaged by all the villains. Looking for more actors often typecast as villains, director Schumacher got Tommy Lee Jones to parody his villain persona as Harvey ""Two-Face"" Dent. Also, there was still that rubberface persona in Jim Carrey as the Riddler as well. 1997's ""Batman and Robin"" was a total washout. So Nolan came to rescue this moribund franchise and made his own franchise moody with dark colors, mature, less focus on the action and more on the story and detailed development of each character without exploiting them. In 2005, ""Batman Begins"" was just the beginning, but ""The Dark Knight"" is the real story. It would be sin that Christopher Nolan does not get nominated for an Oscar, just as well as Heath Ledger, for best director.Christian Bale is, and many people would agree with me, the best Batman of them all. With his rich performance, we do know him better than Adam West, Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, and George Clooney put together. We know Bruce Wayne's haunted past and demons, and why he becomes his alter ego Batman to fight crime in Gotham City. Unlike Cesar Romero and Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger is a much more complicated joker. He doesn't torture people just for pure torture. He doesn't laugh maliciously between every single sentence. He grew up with such an abusive upbringing that he wants to exploit Batman as a fraud for Gotham City, even bringing in Batman clones with the typical Caped Crusader outfit on the crime scenes just to tell Bruce Wayne ""Will the real Batman stand up?""All the other actors give excellent, detailed performances. Maggie Gyllenhal gives a stronger performance than Katie Holmes (Mrs. Tom Cruise) as Bruce Wayne's love interest Assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes, but is smitten with D.A. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) in the end. Gary Oldman, in one of his few good-guy roles, does a fine turn as the mustachioed Commissioner Gordon, more serious than the one we've seen on TV. Veteran thespians Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are always a treat to watch as the faithful butler Alfred and the gadget inventor Lucius Fox. These two men get better with age each time they make movies. And Aaron Eckhart plays Harvey ""Two-Face"" Dent not as a torturous villain like Tommy Lee Jones did before, but as a victim wounded by the Joker's torture in a gas chamber out to seek revenge with his coin as his calling card for what could be good or what could better yet turn out for bad on his intended targets.The summer of 2008 had a lot of movies. I've seen ""Mamma Mia"" as a light feel-good musical comedy riddled with off-key singing, notably by Pierce Brosnan. I've seen ""Wall-E,"" which I thought was Pixar's blander efforts. Remy the rat from last year upstaged this robot on all costs. But ""The Dark Knight"" is the best movie of the summer. When it comes to comic book stories, as I said before, directors Burton and Schumacher got all caught up in themselves with too much action and seemed to forget their audiences. Nolan never does.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9977,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Unmatchable (super)hero movie.,"Maybe for me and I think most of true Batman fans at first glance this isn't comic book Batman that I was expecting. It's marvelous how Nolan succeeded to present in one movie Batman that is so realistic and that we can connect to it and really be pulled into movie and that he preserves all craziness of Joker that is demanded from his character. Batman movie can be done in various ways and one reason is because Batman and his greatest enemy have no superpowers and I see that as a good thing because then you have more space and need to present these characters not as someone who can really exist but as someone who put you more into movie and unreal world of comic book at the same time.

"""The Dark Knight"" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars","Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, ""Dark Knight"" ably stands on its own with or without ""Batman Begins"". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the ""Batman"" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in ""Batman Forever"", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.""The Dark Knight"" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"

A Huge Improvement Over Its Predecessor; the Greatest Superhero Film of All Time,"""Batman Begins"" is certainly a great movie. It had its weaknesses, such as the lack of a strong villain and a finale that left me a bit disappointed. Christopher Nolan's interpretation of the character was certainly the darkest and most down to earth that we'd seen up until that point. Its sequel film manages to do something truly spectacular and blow that movie out of the water.The dichotomy between the Joker (Heath Ledger) and Batman (Christian Bale) is what makes this film a modern classic. The Joker acts as a force of pure malicious evil. And Batman acts as a force of pure incorruptible good. In all honesty though, the Joker is the main character of this film. It is he who drives the plot forward. And saying that Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest villain performances of all time shouldn't be taken lightly, especially when other Academy Award winning actors have also done tremendous things with the character. Ledger's Joker is a completely different beast, a truly vicious and terrifying psychopath. He absolutely elevates this already stupendous crime drama to a higher level.Often downplayed by other reviewers, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) also plays a crucial role. The pureness of both Batman and the Joker in their respective sides is contrasted by a man who is completely neutral and leaves every decision to chance. Although every performance in this movie is naturally overshadowed by Ledger's, Eckhart does a great job as well. As do Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman. A truly stellar cast.The cinematography and action sequences are great. Amazing visuals that you expect out of a Nolan film.Not much else to say about this classic. It deserves all of the adulation and recognition that it receives. It is in a completely different league above all other superhero films in that it places us in a dark, gritty, and macabre world, where the heroes are truly heroic and the villains are truly villainous.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Unpredictable movie,"""The Dark Knight,"" directed by Christopher Nolan, is a cinematic triumph that redefines the superhero genre.

"The Dark Knight is storytelling at its best, Christopher Nolan has created another masterpiece - My Ultimate Review","Batman: The Dark Knight improves on everything from Begins and I mean everything, this film has next to no flaws. It's Christopher Nolan at his finest, creating a film that everyone can like, superhero fan or not. The brilliant storytelling is there, so is the breathtaking cinematography and of course the superb direction from Nolan. It doesn't matter if you're a fan of Batman or superhero films in general for this movie, it's after all considered to be one of the best films of its decade and one of the greatest and most influential films of all time. The film received eight nominations at the Oscars, winning the award for Best Sound Editing and Best Supporting Actor for Ledger's performance as the Joker. In 2020, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"", becoming the second superhero film after 1978's Superman to earn the honor.When the menace known as the Joker wreaks havoc and chaos on the people of Gotham, Batman must accept one of the greatest psychological and physical tests of his ability to fight injustice.Christian Bale portrays Bruce Wayne and Batman, doing both the physical part as Batman and the dramatic part of Bruce Wayne, giving each his all and ultimately giving us one of the best live action portrayals of the Dark Knight. There is so many things Bale does right and I love his take on the iconic Caped Crusader, but there are people who have some criticism towards him and that's completely fine. Though he wasn't perfect in Batman Begins, Bale have truly grown into the role and with his method acting he doesn't let the audience or himself down, Bale's take on the character is perfect for Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy. Heath Ledger plays The Joker and he took Method Acting to the extreme, earning himself many awards along with an oscar. The great and memorable performances doesn't stop with Bale and Ledger, they're joined by talented actors like: Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth, Gary Oldman as James Gordon, Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox. Along with a supporting cast. They capture the comic book versions of the characters and successfully brings quality and fantastic performance to the film, many are extremely memorable like Gary Oldman and Aaron Eckhart, they're simply award worthy. Michael Caine deserves a lot of praise for his role as Alfred, his portrayal is my favorite of all live action portrayals.""You Either Die A Hero Or Live Long Enough To See Yourself Become The Villain."" that's a quote anyone will recognize, the writing is spectacular. From the characters, to dialogue, to world building. The screenplay are simply impressive and fantastic in so many ways. The screenplay is written by Christopher Nolan and Jonathan Nolan, but the story was co-written by David S. Goyer. I just can't praise the writers enough. There's various of themes in the film, most are mature and I'll just say it now, it's a dark movie but done perfectly. Some themes are: The Triumph of Evil Over Good, Justice versus Corruption, The Thin Line Between Anarchy and Order and The Terrible Logic of Human Nature. Honestly, the film could easily be looked at as a black and white story with Batman being the good and Joker the bad, but Christopher Nolan takes the story in a grey area that makes you question things, especially those themes I just wrote down, and he succeeds perfectly.Batman: The Dark Knight is full of beautifully crafted and just terrific set pieces, done by how they kept everything grounded with practical effects instead of relying on CGI. Some sequences that just show how great looking film it is, for an example the Bank Heist which was shot entirely in IMAX and it looks fantastic from start to finish with its musical score and incredible direction and cinematography, other sequences worth mentioning are the action sequence when Nolan literally flipped a truck over. I don't want to spoil anything so I'll stop there, but there's so many brilliant and memorable action sequences in this film, what Nolan succeeded in doing is to keep the tension and suspension going and the tempo never slows down. Wally Pfister and Christopher Nolan is to thank for the stunning set pieces, the cinematographer and director. Wally Pfister actually got nominated for an Oscar for his work in this film, an award he was worthy of winning. With The Dark Knight Trilogy, things were to be as grounded and realistic as possible which I thank Christopher Nolan for. It shows in the visual effects, the sets and especially the sound editing. Overall an incredible experience from start to finish with every scene thought out 100%, with foreshadowing and symbolism. The Dark Knight does it extremely well.Experiencing this trilogy for the first time in 4K, starting with Batman Begins and now The Dark Knight. I just have to say it's brilliant and the right way to watch the film. The HDR is perfect and truly captures the cinematic picture Nolan wanted for these releases, making it the closest to a theatrical viewing. The soundtrack is superb, the music and everything are truly phenomenal. Hans Zimmer worked with James Newton Howard in creating the unique and powerful musical score, a truly mesmerizing one. It's still a mind blowing experience to watch after all these times, and a film I'll continue to rewatch. If not for the beautiful cinematography and direction, it's the acting and characterization, but also its action sequences and top notch visual effects. There's so much to enjoy in this film, from the heroes to its villains and everything in between, The Dark Knight is what The Return of the King is to Lord of the Rings, a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"

A Matter of Perspective,"I sat down with this movie after knowing that most people loved and seemed to venerate it. But I have a lot of perspective. I was reading Batman comics back in 1957, and I have seen all of the greatest movies ever made. This just isn't one of them. I did not care about anyone. The action was remorseless and unnecessary, one could even say gratuitous. I even turned it off by the 2-hour mark because it got so maudlin and disjointed. I did read something about people voting this into fifth position of the greatest 250 movies ever made, and clearly this shows the weight of current voters who have little experience with good movies. Why, they should be asked, does Citizen Kane, a 1941 movie always rank as the best movie ever? Because it had story, wonderful acting, human nature, and on and on, all things missing from Dark Knight.Movies today are thrown together with lots of action, preposterous stories, and computer effects. Characters survive falls and bangs that would put anyone, including a linebacker for the NFL, in hospital for a week or more. As with another reviewer, I am now finding it hard to remember to much about this movie, but I can remember every scene in a great movie, like The Maltese Falcon, etc.",3.0,Anonymous,0.0005,0.9995,-0.999,"Action, Crime, Drama"

One of my favorite movies.,"The dark knight rises is a masterpiece. It's a movie I can watch over and over. It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Heath ledgers role in this movie is excellent. He played the joker perfectly. The movie ends very well. It's a lengthy movie but it doesn't seem very long because it keeps you interested. I believe this movie should be ranked higher in the top 250 honestly. At least number 2. This movie doesn't overload you on any one element. There's a perfect amount of action, drama, suspense, and some comical aspects in there too. Nolan did an excellent job on this movie and the whole trilogy actually. This isn't one of those movies where you can predict the ending or how things will play out, this is the joker. The joker being in this one just throws you all over the place without making it confusing, surprising would be a good word for it. There is so many plot twists. All in all.

The Peak of Cinema,"The Dark Knight is the peak of cinema, and if you disagree, this is at least the peak of cinema for DC. Joker is absolutely iconic and has some good jokes, but you can't help but feel that he is a true threat. With the previous movie in the trilogy, the villain had certain goals to cleanse society; they weren't completely immoral. Heath Ledger's Joker stops at nothing. His goal is to make chaos, and as a great butler once said, ""Some people just want to watch the world burn"", which is perfect description for this character, testing to see how even merely mentions of his future actions can drive the world into a craze.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9985,0.0015,0.9971,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Then I watched it again and liked it a bit better. Now I think it's good, or could even be very good.I'm finally starting to understand Heath Ledger's Joker performance. I now think it's great. I think the point is that it is such a facade it leaves you wondering what is behind that facade, and then you realise there's nothing there. That is what makes the performance so terrifying. The Joker IS the mask. Who is wearing it?A criticism I have now heard from a few people about this movie - a movie nobody dared to criticise for years - is that there should have been only one villain. Joker was enough. I now feel inclined to agree. Harvey Dent is a great character, but Two-Face feels unnecessary. His descent into bad guy mode, after being a true hero, also feels unwarranted. Such a massive turnaround probably needed a whole movie to explain. Instead Two-Face gets Joker's leftovers.I also feel the movie was too long.

Old is Gold,"The saying ""Old is Gold"" is a great example for movies like The Dark Knight. It's been 11 years, and the more I think about it, the better the movie gets.

Once you rewatch it, and actually think about the message that it sends about society, villains, and how certain sacrifices must be made for the greater good, even if we don't agree with them. This is no good v bad guy movie,it's so much more than that. Most will probably agree with me that Nolan is the greatest director of the 21st century.

"Quite simply, redefining a genre, one of the greats.","First of all let me start by saying this film is in the elite list of best ever sequels. Only a few sequels in film history have been better than the first, this film is one of the best examples of that. The first in the trilogy was a solid movie, but what The Dark Knight did was take it to that next level, it brought in some of the best characters in a genius way and elevated it to a modern classic.A lot of this films success is down to the perfect casting, Christian Bale reprising his role as Bruce Wayne / Batman, Heath Ledger taking on the Joker in what can be described as one of the best on screen performances in history, to Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox and Gary Oldman as James Gordon, although the last 3 characters are supporting, they truly do make the film and give you the heart of the movie.What Christopher Nolan did when making this movie was redefine a genre, every comic book movie since has tried to do what he did with this movie but just hasn't been able to capture the same spark. There will always be Batman but I truly believe this will be the one everyone looks to for many years as the greatest of all.The Dark Knight truly is a cinematic masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Dark Screen (finally),"This movie is too long by about 30 minutes. I was happy when the screen finally went dark. A filmmaker should be able to get his point across in under 2 hours or before the collective audience ass starts hurting.It's a comic book and the effects and makeup are really great, but still, some of it is too inexplicable and so beyond the possible that it undermines the characters. The Joker is deliciously strange and evil but if he can arrange those events that are so very complex, he starts to look more like a circus ringleader whose dancing dogs and fireworks are the real characters.The story was very hard for me to follow. I don't appreciate having to try so hard to figure out what and why things happen in a movie. I am still not sure why Mr. ""Two Face"" went sour and frankly I didn't care that he did.There is a very heavy thematic effort here; much of film is trying to clearly define good vs. evil and the shifting ambiguity of that, to end with Batman becoming rather dark and isolated. I applaud this kind of effort in an action film, but here the authors take just too long to get there. I was itching to get out of my seat and had to force myself to sit through to the very end, and that's not good for any movie.",6.0,Anonymous,0.0006,0.9994,-0.9989,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Everyone thinks this movie is such a masterpiece.... except me,"There's one thing about ""The Dark Knight"" that I just don't get... why? Why do so much people make it out to be something that it's not? I don't call it a masterpiece for enough reasons.1) I didn't find it gripping, and I thought it was schmaltzy as hell, just like all the movies I see these days2) Sure, it was good, but it's not a masterpiece because I don't call it groundbreaking, despite the fact that it made a helluva lot of money and was the biggest-grossing movie of 2008. Honestly, even I've seen better and I'm almost 17! I don't think it's the kind of movie that leaves a mark on the worldwide consciousness and it doesn't mean much to me personally3) It was WAY, WAY, over-anticipated.I honestly don't know if there's any ground left to break, but sure, we can still show audiences that artistry and business shouldn't be two different things. I'd really like to see Hollywood do more stuff like that. Bottom line, what was good back in the Golden Age is still good now. I think both the American people and people all over the world can still handle craftsmanship. I gave the movie 6 stars out of 10 just to be generous.I'd love to see someone pull it off but I don't know if they'd have the guts.To call ""The Dark Knight"" a masterpiece is to say that the viewer clearly has not seen a wide range of films.You wanna know what a real masterpiece is? Give ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", the first two ""Star Wars"" films, ""Casablanca"", ""The Wizard of Oz"", or the first two Indiana Jones films a try and think about it.",6.0,Anonymous,0.0013,0.9987,-0.9974,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Not even the best movie of 2008.,"To start, I would like to say that this movie is not even as good as Batman Begins. Christian Bale is one of my favorite actors, Batman is one of the best super heroes, but that still does not mean this equates to The Shawshank Redemption or The Godfather.This is a very good movie, but it is not deserving of all of the hype surrounding it. Health Ledger's death had more of an impact on this movie's critical acclaim than anything in the actual movie. The Joker is pretty cool because the screen writers made him cool, not because Health Ledger delivered an Oscar worthy performance or any of that other BS. People seem to forget that Liam Neeson played his character in Begins at least as well if not better than Heath Ledger played The Joker. Also, Christian Bale is predominately playing his snobby Bruce Wayne character in this film, which is quite annoying. After seeing the movie, you might even realize that Christian Bale's obscure placement throughout the film is a major flaw.The Godfather is around 3 hours, this is around 2&1/2 hours, yet this movie feels much slower. Rather than keeping a steady pace, the movie seems to doze off for a while followed by huge explosions and overly drawn out 30 minute action sequences. It's ridiculous.The best movie of 2008 is In Bruges, not TDK.",2.0,Anonymous,0.0248,0.9752,-0.9505,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Amazing!!  to say the least........,"Let's start with Batman's last line ""You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain"". This movie is surely the best of the year so far and deservedly so.I'll keep it short...all the characters and are given a worth time on screen(although i still want more of heath:p).The direction is superb as well is the acting by whole cast, even the small characters of Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are very well dealt with.But the most important person who steals the show is one and truly MR.Heath Ledger; even Batman looks a bit frightened by him(look at the eyes of batman when he interacts with joker in cell).This is easily the best batman movie and way better than ""Begins"".So i'll just say watch it even if u are not familiar with batman franchise.Watch it simply for the cynicism of heath ledger and u'll know why is there an Oscar buzz.Hat's off to Nolan and RIP Heath Ledger we'll miss ya.

On of the best Superhero film,"It was a wonderful experience to watch Heath Ledger's Final performance on the big screen. The film was fantastic along with the film techniques shown (especially the interrogation scene). The film itself is an is an extraordinary experience. It will keep you glued to your seat as you take in what Nolan had to offer it's audience. All the actors especially Heath Ledger as the Joker are an unforgettable. I am pretty sure the rest that going to view the film or have already seen it will agree. Although not a masterpiece, it belongs to be with the best films in history. I'd be shocked if Heath is not nominated for an Oscar, or any other film related Oscars such as Sound or Cimenitography, this film is a well notable film to be considered an Epic",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"
never seen nor will see a movie like this!!,"It is a movie made by a passionate film maker ,whose passion could be sensed in every set pieces and story elements .I happened to be very fortunate to get to watch it on its opening day 18 july ,2008.And whatever ill assumption I made before entering the theater was completely vanished and i was speechless ,from its glittering imax footage ,action chase sequences to human emotions , everything is top notch ,I hardly believe ever there could be any film made with such perfection. This is not an ordinary movie which is made from computer graphics footage but believe me the stunts are for real and performed under strict guidance and a lot of practice and a lot of hard work .

"A Cinematic Triumph: ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) Soars to Unprecedented Heights","Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is not just a superhero film; it's a cinematic spectacle that redefines the genre, setting an unparalleled standard for storytelling, character development, and technical brilliance. Released in 2008, this second installment of Nolan's Batman trilogy is a brooding, intense masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of comic book adaptations.At the core of ""The Dark Knight"" is the late Heath Ledger's iconic portrayal of the Joker, a performance that stands as one of the most mesmerizing in cinematic history. Ledger's Joker is a chaotic force of nature, an embodiment of anarchy that leaves an indelible mark on Gotham City. His nuanced and chilling performance posthumously earned him an Academy Award, a testament to his dedication and the depth he brought to the character.Christian Bale, reprising his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman, delivers a compelling performance, grappling not only with the physical challenges of crime-fighting but also with the moral complexities of being a symbol for justice. The film introduces Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, Gotham's charismatic district attorney, whose tragic transformation into Two-Face adds a layer of moral ambiguity that elevates the narrative.Nolan's direction is nothing short of visionary. He creates a Gotham that is gritty, realistic, and morally complex. The film's practical effects, breathtaking cinematography by Wally Pfister, and Hans Zimmer's haunting score contribute to the immersive experience. The use of IMAX cameras for key sequences, including the legendary chase scene, sets ""The Dark Knight"" apart as a technical marvel.The screenplay, co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, is a labyrinth of moral dilemmas and psychological depth. It explores themes of chaos, morality, and the thin line between hero and villain. The Joker's philosophy challenges Batman's very existence, pushing the Caped Crusader to confront the darkness within himself.""The Dark Knight"" is not just a superhero film; it's a crime drama, a character study, and a gripping exploration of the human psyche. The film's pacing is relentless, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats from start to finish. Nolan's commitment to practical effects and a gripping narrative sets a benchmark that subsequent superhero films aspire to reach.In conclusion, ""The Dark Knight"" is a triumph of storytelling and filmmaking. It transcends the superhero genre, leaving an enduring impact on both cinema and popular culture. Ledger's Joker is not just a villain; he's an enigma, a force of chaos that mirrors the complexities of the human condition. ""The Dark Knight"" is a cinematic gem that continues to resonate, proving that even in the realm of caped crusaders, artistry and depth can coexist.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9979,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Too Dark.,"I know there were a lot of hype and excitement about this film, but I think it's the weakest in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. Though it does have some strong movie elements such as good special effects, high drama and a haunting music score, this film is too dark even for Batman. The plot drags, action and violence are overkill and some of the cast performances were weak.As a fan of the comics, I was hoping that this trilogy would follow the comic continuity more than the Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher series. But, it wasn't meant to be.We have a story about Batman trying to rid the city of the remaining mobs, but ended up facing a new villain, the Joker. Later on in the story, crime-fighting Harvey Dent flips a nerve and turn into Two-Face. While pretty good acting, Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker was too manic and sadistic. I didn't care for the make-up and costume as well. Aaron Eckhart's performance of Harvey Dent/Two-Face drove me off the wall - bland as Harvey Dent and much too angry as Two-Face.I know Director Nolan wanted to avoid camp at all cost after what we've went through with Schumacher's films, but the story is too serious and dark. I would highly recommend ""Batman Begins"" or ""The Dark Knight Rises"" over this. While also dark, those two films had much better character development, compelling plots and a better balance of humor.Grade D+",5.0,Anonymous,0.0005,0.9995,-0.999,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Is this is a Comic Book Movie?,"Let me preface this comment by saying I'm not a huge fan of comic books or comic book movies by default, but I do enjoy the genre if it's done well. I really enjoyed Batman Begins, and the Frank Miller take on Batman in the Dark Knight Returns. As much as I liked them however, they felt like a ""comic-book"". Not to deride the genre, but if you read a lot of comic books you probably know what I mean when I say this. There's a certain level of cheese and immaturity associated with any character that straps on tights and an animal-themed costume to battle crime.However, the question that kept going through my mind when watching the Dark Knight was ""Is this really a comic-book movie?"" And I think that's no accident. Chris Nolan is certainly a master of his art and every choice that was made in this movie seemed to spring out of this idea. The sepia tone is out, replaced with a more ultra-realist look: when it's night, it's dark and when it's day it's light. The characters are somewhat over-the-top but ultimately believable: the word superhero and supervillain is never used in the movie, and even their comic-book names seem to be rarely (if ever) uttered. And the action is cool, but hardly over-the-top. The only thing that's really ""comic-book"" about the movie is Batman's costume, which is made about as practical as possible while still staying true to the character. It's all tied together with a rock-solid script that asks tough, thought-provoking questions, yet never gives way to a dull moment (in fact, it was so intense I think it gave me heart palpitations).Certainly a risky move to pull in a film that's appealing to an audience that is generally looked down upon by the mass media. But I think Nolan (and his brother) give their audience much more credit than the typical movie maker and it pays off--well, it did for me.What I'm trying to say is this movie is good. It's so good you may, like me, find yourself questioning your definition of ""comic-book"" movie.",9.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9979,"Action, Crime, Drama"
One of the best movies ever made. See it to believe it!,"This Joker will put a smile on your face!Batman History: Gone are the days when Adam West's campy Batman T.V series used to be the only source of ""Bat Entertainment"" for the audience. The Batman movies of the 90s did not do justice to the great comic book icon. They all made the caped crusader appear as a happy-go-lucky masked vigilante who saved the day at the end with his ""Bat Gadgets"". Where was the character development? A real plot? (Oh please, not the penguin-stole-candy-from-a-baby plot). The superficial storyline and lack of commitment catalysed the fiasco of the Batman franchise. All in all, much to the dismay of fans, a costly costume party was all that we ever saw!A Knight was born: 'Batman Begins"" at last delved into the dark and troubled past of Bruce Wayne. A man trying to find his identity, conquer his worst fears and overcome the grief of the unjust murder of his parents. A man who becomes invincible as a symbol. The magic of this movie lies in the fact that although it is not real, it makes you want to believe that it is!The Dark Knight: The success of Batman Begins opened the flood gates of great expectations and surreal anticipation for perhaps one of the most awaited movie sequels, let alone a Batman sequel. With expectations and speculations running wild, the overzealous promotion and media hype knew no bounds. The Dark Knight was put under microscope long before its scheduled release. The tragic loss of Heath Hedger, especially after whispers of his alleged over-the-top performance, added fuel to the fire. With fans and critics eagerly waiting to sing praise or eviscerate the movie alike, Dark Knight made a smashing entry! The question is, did this movie deliver? Did it live up to the unrealistic expectations of the fans? No. It surpassed it! This movie is not just for fans of Batman, but for all those who love to see a masterpiece. It certainly stretched the limitations of a typical comic book movie. The Joker is not just the avergae psychotic villain who blows things up and deliver jabs and witty retorts. No no no no no! He is more than that. A lot more than that. His every word has a deep psychological connotation to it. He poses moral dilemmas that play with the boundaries of normal ethical conduct and human psyche. Simply put, he puts people under the microscope and test their reaction under extreme situations. And he does it with flair! That's the beauty of it. He creates ingenious situations and traps that tricks everybody into believing something, while something else is happening. Bruce Wayne is pushed to such extremes that he thinks that his days as the caped crusader are coming to an end... As Rachel puts it, ""Bruce don't make me your only hope for a normal life"". We also find that The Joker and Batman have a lot in common. Joker pretty much sums up the entire comic book history between him and Batman as ""You and I are destined to do this forever""... Although they are portrayed as freaks with troubed childhood, it all comes down to the choices that people make at testing times. Harvey and Bruce are both influenced by The Joker's brilliant yet fiendish schemes and the outcome is colossal... You've gotta see it for yourself! This so much more than an action movie. A psychological thriller? Perhaps. The way Joker manipulates human nature is simply ""mind blowing"". Believe me, he is more than what you expect him to be in every single moment of the movie. His influence on Harvey Dent is even more intriguing than it is on the rest. And the fact that special effects are less prominent compared to character development and storyline goes to show that drama and theatrics impacts people on a personal level that all the CGI in the world cannot conjure up. It simply makes you care for the character rather than being a mute spectator of a violent showdown. This movie revolves around deep forgotten fears, traumas, hope, faith and courage.

"Definitely not the best movie of all time, but extraordinary in its own league","Naturally, ""The Dark Knight"" doesn't deserve a #1 spot on a Top 250 list (it's ranked #1 on IMDb with a 9.4/10 rating out of 156, 218 votes as of July 28, 2008), but that's a silly discussion since everyone has a different favourite film and you can't expect ""Citizen Kane"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (neither of these is my fave, by the way) to be more popular than (good or bad) summer blockbusters on a virtual world populated mostly by teenagers who dig Michael Bay's flicks (and I hate to sound so arrogant here, I'm not trying to imply young people have no taste, I barely left my teenage years myself... but that's the average public, right?), thus these lists shouldn't be taken too seriously.That said, ""The Dark Knight"" promises and delivers, more than living up to the hype. Christopher Nolan made something even bigger and better than his ""Batman Begins"" (2005), topping Tim Burton's first two installments of the series (and let's not even mention Joel Schumacher's name... he doesn't need to be humiliated any more than he's been - let's just forget he exists). The movie works in epic proportions as the possible greatest superhero movie ever made, and easily the most exciting action movie in many years (and this is coming from someone who doesn't dig action flicks that much). The cast (Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman) is also the best in the whole series, and Ledger is clearly the standout (and trust me, he's THAT good, and all that praise isn't because of sentimental reasons): his Joker is a blast, psychotic, scary, hilarious and darkly charismatic. And if the buzz makes it to the end of the year, I can definitely see him getting a well deserved posthumous Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. Whether you're a huge Batman fan or just want a perfect summer flick, ""The Dark Knight"" shall not let you down.

"A fantastic movie, truly a worthy successor to Batman Begins.","I went to see this movie with fairly high hopes that it was going to be a pearler. All the trailers looked good, the press were raving about Heath's portrayal of the Joker, and most of all it was a Batman movie. A character i had grown up with watching on TV. While this movie, like the previous title Batman Begins takes a big leap away from what everyone except the Batman comic book lovers have seen. It lands solidly on a firm ground made up of fans who are going to find this movie an absolute joy.Christian Bale is back as the Batman and he works just as hard as he did in the last movie to bring that character to life. He plays Bruce Wayne down to a tea and his aggressiveness and ability to fight Shine through the big black suit. His voice, while some call it too strained and annoying as Batman I find fitted the role well. This is not the Batman we are used to seeing. But I hope to see a lot more of it.Heath's acting in this movie is unlike anything i have ever seen before. Both he and Director Christopher Nolan have done an amazing job with the character. Never has a character made me feel afraid, horrified, confused then had me laughing in hysterics all in the space of 10 seconds. At times he truly is a horrifying figure to watch, then he switches to to a lunatic you cant help but laugh at. They have managed to truly capture what the Joker really is in this movie. A dangerously insane human being.Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent/2 face. His performance was also excellent. You could sense the frustration within Harvey's character in his fight to clean Gotham City of the mob families and the Joker. Yet there was such a change in character once the transition from one to the other took place. And he did it superbly. I look forward to seeing this character develop.Other notable performances were Michael Caine as Alfred, Gary Oldman as James Gordon, Eric Roberts as Salvatore Maroni and a small role by William Fichtner as the bank manager (But I'm just a fan of whatever he does :) ) Overall the film is a monster coming in at a runtime of 2 hours 32 minutes. But in no way do you feel it. The movie manages to stay fresh and vibrant throughout. The action comes at you fast and intense and there is plenty of it. All in all this film will surpass any hype you have seen or heard about it. Its worthy of any awards it or its actors are nominated for.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9979,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Close to perfection,"The chills that I got while watching this movie was something i don't get that often. The already legendary role of the Joker played by Heath Ledger is nothing more then ... well legendary. Ledger isn't playing the Joker in this movie, he is the Joker. To me Ledger makes a big part of the movie. But however it is unfair to only credit Ledgers performance because there is so much else that is good about this movie.Let's not forget the terrific job Nolan has done in making Batman come alive again. I honestly thought that even though Batman Begins was good Nolan was never gonna be able to live up to the whole Batman vibe that was going round for months. Well I can also honestly tell you that the movie knocked my socks off. So i guess i was wrong.And then there is the great chemistry between all the actors. It just works. Christiane Bale does a more then decent job in portraying the Batman once more. Michael Caine an Morgan Freeman both flawlessly take on there roles and then let's not forget the breathtaking Maggie Gyllenhaal. Who shows convincingly that she was up to take the role of a blockbuster dame. Also Aaron Eckard does a great job in portraying the overly good Harvey Denth. And Gary Oldman isn't the least boring in his role as a fighter of injustice in Gotham.Everybody in this movie adds an important deal in the clever storyline that Christopher Nolan has set out for the Dark Knight. Because The Dark Knight indeed has a clever and not at all predictable story line. Batman is still a blockbuster so don't expect a memento like plot but it's definitely better what we are used from Warner Bros blockbusters.Even though it's all that people talk about I still want to end this review with the performance of Ledger. When I first heard that Heath Ledger was assigned to the role of the Joker I was a little more then surprised. I mean don't get me wrong hes made some good movies before this, but the Joker isn't exactly the same as a gay cowboy. 'You need someone a little disturbed for this role'. Well who knew that Ledger had a bit of psychopathic terror in him after all. In his role as the Joker he makes Hannibal Lector look like a family entertainer. Ledger completes the movie. The Dark knight is good, but Ledger is Phenomenal. This is a movie that you have to go see!

Darker than Burton's?,"I would have to say that Nolan has done something that no other Batman film director could ever do - make a darker film than Tim Burton. Tim's over-the-top circus-like direction, while albeit dark, isn't anywhere near as dark and gritty as this film is.Let's start with the Joker first off. Ledger has outclassed Nicholson in this role. This isn't the prim and proper Joker that Nicholson displayed - this Joker is a force of nature that plays by absolutely no rules except his own twisted moral code. He cares more about chaos and mayhem more than he would ever care about money or fame. He lives off the fear of the populace. Nicholson's obsession with the Batman had more to do with him creating the Joker, versus a twisted and depraved fascination with Batman being the symbol of hope for a doomed city. Turning the Joker into a bona fide terrorist fits today's post-911 world like a glove in terms of creating a visceral reaction within the audience. Nicholson's Joker was more preoccupied with settling personal vendettas than being a terrorist, which means that his Joker isn't near as fascinating.Likewise, Two-Face in this film is more in line with Nicholson's Joker this time around. His existence in this film is purely about personal vendettas, but if there is one complaint I have about this film, is that he's largely overshadowed by the Joker. Again, someone who has personal vendettas unfortunately isn't near as interesting or compelling as someone who's unpredictable and destroys things just for the hell of it. While I do agree that having Harvey Dent in the film was a good idea to move Batman's story along, I would be loathe to say that Two-Face is the star attraction here.All the stars here seem to know what's at stake with this film, so they give it their all. Even with Heath Ledger out of the equation, the performances are fine. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman really do take advantage of their supporting roles in the film, and use the limited screen time they have to make an impact. Christian Bale does another fine job as the freewheeling playboy as well.Lastly, one cannot say enough about the special effects. The effects in this film rival all other superhero films. An IMAX camera was even used for certain scenes, heightening the impact even more.Even if you like the 1989 Batman film, I highly recommend you see this one. It out-Burtons Burton.",9.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9979,"Action, Crime, Drama"
"I'm not a Batman geek or overexcited teenager, but I still liked this movie a lot","I really don't like to jump on a band wagon like this. Though I had been longing for this movie for over a year and though I was expecting great things from it, this nerdy and geeky talk of comic book fans (""best movie ever"") really got onto my nerves. Living in Germany, I had to wait until yesterday to finally watch the movie and I could watch all the craziness going on on the net from afar. I still wanted to like the movie, but I really feared that all this hype might ruin it for me.Well, now that I have finally seen it I have to say that my fears were to a large part unnecessary. the movie is great and I think it is as good as a movie like this can be. Though I still get annoyed by teenagers who yell that this is the best movie ever, I can understand where they are coming from. Every decade or so there is one movie that becomes a real phenomenon. And if you never experienced this than you become part of the group that says ""this is our movie and we won't let grumpy idiots take it away from us"". When I was at that age for me it was ""Jurassic Park"" and later to a certain extent also ""Titanic"" and I bet most of the kids who hype this movie have not been consciously around then.I thought the acting was great overall. Heath Ledger definitely stands out. Christian Bale is great, too. His work as the twisted Batman/Bruce Wayne character has to be a lot more subtle in this movie and he achieves that wonderfully. Unfortunately, due to Ledger's tour de force performance, Bale's work seems to go unappreciated by many here. I could go on and on. There is not a single weak performance in this movie (although the Mayor becomes a bit distracting because of his heavy eye-liner, but that's not the actor's fault).I love the scope of this movie. The main storyline is always in focus but there still is room for subplots here and there which are all set up perfectly and fit within the overall plot. And even though you might wish to see more of some characters (like Alfred) you nevertheless don't feel that they were underused. The pacing is great as well. You keep being interested the entire time and the movie flows so naturally that you never get the feeling that this action sequence here happens because there has to be an action sequence.So, is this the best movie ever? I leave that up to everyone to decide for himself. It is not perfect but no movie, even the best, is completely flawless. There are things in this movie that I didn't like too much. I wish they had done more with Two-Face and the whole bit about the cell phones seemed a bit gimmicky for me (I also didn't like Batman's eyes in these scenes).But there is so much to like in this film. One has to applaud the filmmakers for going against conventions by for example killing of characters not just at the climax of the movie but right in the middle. I also loved it that the movie does not end with the big machine of the villain that he has to start in order to rule the world (even ""Batman begins"" fell into that trap). They found a perfectly neat solution to it all and though I think the ending is not perfect, I think it still is great as it is.The same thing can be said about the whole movie. I love it that the script of this movie is so smart that it even takes time to ask philosophical questions. Sure, it doesn't go too deep but it is mentioned in a way that most moviegoers will be able to think about this.I had a perfect time at the cinema and think that for what it is, this movie can indeed be called a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9979,"Action, Crime, Drama"
The dark knight made Batman my hero!,"I watched ""The dark knight"" in an IMAX theater in Houston last summer. Like many others who have seen the dark knight I would describe the film in one word: Wow. It was incredible. The movie went quickly to the top of my Netflix account so I was able to watch it again immediately after its DVD release.unfortunately (or fortunately) I have not seen any other Batman movies before so Batman was not my hero when I first saw the film. The story, however, does not require any background to masterfully make you fall deep into the stream of Gotham city events. The movie begins strongly, progresses constantly and ends amazingly.There are five actors at their best performances in this movie. Christian Bale (Batman), Heath Ledger (Joker), Gary Oldman (James Gordon), Michael Caine (Alfred), and Morgan Freeman (Fox). Other actors and actresses are also good. Although I think that Rachel's role deserved a much better actress than Maggie Gyllenhaal.The cinematography and music is excellent. Although you may need to watch the movie in an IMAX theater to fully acknowledge it.It was one of the best movies that I've seen in years. I won't be surprised if the movie wins 8 Oscar awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor in a Leading Role (Bale), Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Ledger or Oldman, God that's a difficult choice), Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, and Best Sound Editing.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"
A Tragic Masterpiece,"The Dark Knight, truly is dark and raw, it digs deep and provokes. Going in, I knew it was gonna be dark, but with this Shakespearian/Hamlet tragedy, it becomes so much more entirely. The movie deals so seamlessly with the ideas of human nature, psychological core, emotions of hate, revenge, torture, angst, betrayal, sadness. The action is notched up, and boy does it deliver. From the opening scene to the final scene, you will be spell-binded. You really don't know what's gonna happen next!Bale delivers a heartfelt performance, Oldman shines, ECKHART is amazing at the end, and of course Ledger well was the Joker himself. I couldn't even get past that the man behind the makeup was Heath. His character is absolute, but very complex, in that, credit to writers, his actions paradoxically have so much meaning. He too symbolizes an ideal, anarchy, and does so breathlessly illustrating his view of the world, that provokes and delivers some forbidden truth.The mythical, tragic overtones, themes, and character arcs make this film a masterpiece. Amazing, amazing, amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9979,"Action, Crime, Drama"
"Dark, brilliant, and the best movie of the year.","The Dark Knight was setting records even before its release. The hype was on since late 2007, and was only fueled by the sudden and tragic death of Heath Ledger in January. Did The Dark Knight live up to the massive expectations? Yes. Definitely.The story progresses very well, and the 2 and half hour running time flies by. Pay attention though, or you may get lost.The action is plentiful, and there is just the right amount. Not too much, not too little. There aren't too many explosions just for show, and the special effects look great.PerformancesChristian Bale is spot on as the tormented defender of Gotham. He gives a very believable performance in one scene of raw emotion that I won't spoil here.Michael Caine once again plays Alfred in a role that makes him a mentor/friend even more so than in Begins, or any of the older movies for that matter.Morgan Freeman also reprises his role as Lucius Fox, who once again supplies Bruce with the gadgets and cutting-edge technology he needs to combat crime.Maggie Gyllenhaal, who replaces Katie Holmes from Batman Begins, plays Rachel Dawes, a pivotal character in the movie, and in the lives of Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent. Even if you think Gyllenhaal may not be much of a looker, she certainly has far more charisma than Holmes in the role.Newcomer Aaron Eckhart debuts in the series as Harvey Dent, the new District Attorney, and a shining ray of hope on the corrupt Gotham City. Batman thinks he may be the man who may make Gotham no longer need Batman. However, fans of the comics know who he is destined to become.And last, but most certainly not least, Heath Ledger.From the trailers alone, I could tell he was going to give a commanding performance, but I was not expecting this. Ledger completely disappears into the role, and is virtually unrecognizable. He easily gives the best performance of the movie as the psychopathic, sadistic Joker. It is unfortunate and sad he will not be able to reprise his role in the third film, if there will be one.The Dark Knight is easily the best film of the year so far, and by far the darkest. I won't say much, but don't be surprised if you don't get a happy ending.In my opinion, the best film of the year, and the best Batman and superhero movie ever.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9977,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Well worth staying up,"The Dark Knight became the third movie I've gone to a midnight showing for (the other two being Revenge of the Sith and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) and it was by far the best of those films. The energy in the auditorium was palpable. There were times when we collectively gasped, laughed, and cheered.For fans of Batman Begins, The Dark Knight is grittier, funnier, and more complicated. As a matter of fact, the film's only drawback is the complicated storytelling. It made the film two and half hours long, and, moreover, it felt two and a half hours long. Also, the PG-13 rating in America, is quite serious. There are some truly gruesome images and Heath Ledger's Joker is one of the most menacing villains ever to appear on the screen. One villain in the host of supporting baddies who got the short end of the stick in the last film and in this one, was Cillian Murphy's Scarecrow. I almost wish they'd left him out entirely, instead of giving the boy a lousy send-off twice, because Murphy could be a fantastic villain in the third film, in my opinion, anyway.The rest of the returning cast is fantastic, as expected. Christian Bale is perfect as Gotham's self-sacrificing Dark Knight, and he also did a great job with the billionaire playboy side of Bruce Wayne. The banter between Bale and Michael Caine is pitch perfect and is responsible for one of the funniest scenes in the film. Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman are also given a chance to shine in this film. Oldman was especially fantastic as Jim Gordon. Aaron Eckhart is a great Harvey Dent, and I have an easier time with the chemistry between him and Maggie Gyllenhaal than between Gyllenhaal and Bale. While Maggie Gyllenhaal is her usual great self, it's difficult to pretend that she's Rachel Dawes, not only because she's not physically Katie Holmes, but she's practically playing a different character. Suspension of disbelief only goes so far.Overall, it was a fantastic film and a great second installment. My only question is, how will they top themselves for the third one?",9.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"
I cannot find words to describe the brilliance of this film,"In short, The Dark Knight is everything any Batfan could have dreamed of. It is the best of 2008, the best comic book film of all time, and one of the greatest action films ever made. It is carried by the titanic performances of Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart, and stands for more than it seems on the surface, much like its hero.To be honest, I really don't know where to begin. The film has NO flaw as far as I can see (although Bale's take on Batman's voice was noticeably more annoying here, maybe because he spent more time in the suit than he did last time). Christopher Nolan's craft and aptitude for understanding this story...the Batman archetype...is unparalleled. This is not just a comic book film. It's a story of what will happen when you leave the race of men no choice. It's a story of what will happen when desperation takes over the souls and minds of all. And lastly, it's a story of how a man's bond and love for his city affects him. This film is going to undoubtedly going to end up as my favorite film of 2008, and is the only film this year so far to receive a 10 out of 10 rating from me.I know you're all itching to see what I think of the acting, so without further ado, let's go there. Though this is a Batman film, the film is not about Batman...it's about Harvey Dent. It's about his struggle, his pain, his life...and there is no greater actor to play the part than Mr. Aaron Eckhart. An admirable performance saves the film from being too lopsided in the favor of a certain clownish psychopath. Eckhart's show is deep, riveting, and when he inevitably becomes Two Face, emotionally disturbing and destructive. Definitely the most surprising show of the film. Christian Bale's take on Batman...well, I never thought I'd say this, but he didn't actually improve on anything here. It's not in Bale's top 5 as far as performances go, and I got a bit of a wooden vibe from him occasionally. Overall, however he is good enough to the point where he isn't completely overshadowed. The next best show would be from Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon. He really is the only truly good character in the movie, and Oldman's immediate warmth and likability make his show a great one. I enjoyed brief cameos from Cillian Murphy, Bill Fichtner, and Michael Jai White, as well as the performances of Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman (although, like Bale, it's more of the same).I think I'm forgetting someone...OH YEAH! Maggie Gyllenhaal totally erased the memory of Katie Holmes from my mind. Gyllenhaal was excellent as both the fierce and dedicated ADA Rachel Dawes, and the fragile love interest of Bruce and Harvey. Great all around.I still can't help but feel as if I've forgotten something...The action in this film...well, needless to say, it's jaw dropping. Though there was less emphasis on the hand to hand fighting and more on the big bang booms, it was more than understandable because the villains are not as skilled of fighters as our dear Batman is. The film refuses to relent, and borders on horror-like territory numerous times in the film. Despite the length, I never found myself bored or wanting it to end. On the contrary, I was sort of hoping that Heath Ledger would never leave the screen.Oh...THAT'S what I forgot...Ladies and gentlemen, here's the night's entertainment. Without the titanic, terrifying, riveting, and masterful performance of Heath Ledger as The Joker, this film sinks. The film rides on the shoulders of Batman's arch-nemesis, and Ledger takes it and runs away with it. I have trouble finding words to describe how Ledger's Joker made me feel both as I was watching and after. To put it simple, and I'm not lying, Ledger had me shaking for hours after the credits rolled. His voice, his posture, his delivery, his demeanor...all of it makes for the best villainous performance since Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs, and arguably the best villainous performance of all time. Though the viewer hates The Joker with every fiber of themselves, you can't help but be in awe of the mesmerizing show put on by Mr. Ledger. You won't be able to take your eyes off of him.A battle between good and evil doesn't describe the tension between Joker and Batman...it's more like a battle of completely opposite ideals. The Joker, who reigns and revels in anarchy, and Batman, who aims for order and planned course of action. I've never seen a better realization of the relationship between these two comic book titans. However, let us not forget that this movie is more about Harvey Dent than the others, and that most of Joker's actions revolve around Dent's actions, not Batman's. In fact, Joker reminds us that Batman is actually an obstacle to get to Dent.Really, I don't know where to end this review, so I think this is a good place. The Dark Knight is everything any cinemagoer could hope for, and more than anything a Batfan could ever dream of. Though the ending will certainly be controversial amongst Batfans, I don't think it could have ended any other way. Packed with extreme action, a bajillion plot twists, and the most terrifying performance in years make for the best film of 2008, and possibly one of the best of all time. The Dark Knight is perfect film-making, and I plan on seeing it at least 3 more times before it leaves theaters.Oh, and it goes without saying that Ledger deserves an Oscar win for this film.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"
I love Christopher Nolan....,"Dear God I love Christopher Nolan. In his five film career, beginning with ""Memento"" he has not put a foot wrong, building a body of work which supports the assertion that he is the most talented director of his generation. With The Dark Knight he has created the best comic book film ever. Period.Dark Knight is the most perfect blend of style and substance, action and drama that I've ever seen. It's technically brilliant, with awe inspiring action sequences that must be seen to be believed. The action however, is not superfluous but feeds off the dramatic subtext of the script. Nolan explores what it is to be a hero, and the pitfalls of protecting a city that seems to be suffering because of the very existence of that so called hero.Each actor slips perfectly into their role, with honourable mention going to Aaron Eckhart who did far better than I expected as Harvey Dent. Towering above them all however is Heath Ledger. Almost 20 years ago Jack Nicholson portrayed a Joker that many felt could never be topped or re-attempted. Whilst it is unfair to compare the two, one certainty is that it will be at least that long again before any other actor can don the maniacal grin once more. True, the Joker by his very nature is bound to steal the show.....true, the Nolan brothers have scripted the Joker in a unique way, filled with memorable dialogue. Nothing however, can take away from Ledger, who's every movement, every word, every physical nuance is part of a meticulously crafted madman. This Joker ranks among the greatest of villains as he seemingly needs no motivation for his actions other than the constant thirst for chaos. The Joker is all animalistic instinct and in Batman the Joker has found a nemesis whom he enjoys being pitted against. For the Joker it is not the outcome that is important but the fight itself. His lack of fear or reverence to anything is truly terrifying.Ledger's final completed performance is perhaps the mot bittersweet piece of acting to watch as it now serves as a swansong, rather than heralding the arrival of a monumentally talented superstar. There is nothing I can say about Ledger, or the film that hasn't already been said but in there lies the film's true brilliance......I feel the need to rave about it anyway.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Who ever said becoming was better than become?,"It's an unwritten rule that in superhero movies, the sequels rarely to never live up to the standards of the original--how many of us were spellbound by THE MATRIX only to be jilted by its disastrous sequels? THE DARK KNIGHT squashes any presumptions that nothing could ever surpass the original, whose wholesome darkness, originality and excitement made it possible for comic book adaptations/blockbusters to become more than the sum of its genre. Christopher Nolan has outdone himself in every way possible.BATMAN BEGINS was about Bruce Wayne's roots and his journey to becoming Batman. Very interestingly, the emotional arc of THE DARK KNIGHT is not on Batman (though Christian Bale is still solid as both charming Bruce and his darker alter ego), but rather on Harvey Dent's (an excellent Aaron Eckhart) crusade against corruption and how own eventual dark journey that, by either chance or choice, will shape him into a hero or a villain. The love story between Dent and Rachel Dawes, who cannot wait for Bruce anymore, is also what supplies THE DARK KNIGHT with its human heart, and what makes the film's dark turns all the more poignant and suspenseful.Everything about THE DARK KNIGHT is edgier, from the music (the screeching buildup is at times unbearable) to the violence (the Joker's disappearing pencil trick will shock you). A great deal of this is indebted to Heath Ledger. If Ledger hadn't died tragically young last January, the sold-out midnight/3 am/6 am showings probably wouldn't have been as momentous, but the kudos for his performance still would've been higher than the skies. To say that his performance is majestic isn't enough--it transcends Brando and Cagney and de Niro and Malcolm McDowell's astonishing performance as Alex de Large. A film critic for Entertainment Weekly once wrote about Christian Bale in RESCUE DAWN that ""I've never seen the actor look more at home with his own taut charisma."" That praise has to be passed on to Ledger, who seems so comfortable with his madness it's truly terrifying; When I was in the crowded theater I thought, ""this must've been what it was like back in 1955, when REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE came out, just after James Dean died."" Ledger will become a cult figure, there is no doubt. This will be his biggest hit, it is inevitable. But once you surrender yourself to his exquisite madness, you're able to forget the fact that Ledger is gone and that the ghost on-screen is the last of what will remain.The only quibble I have about THE DARK KNIGHT is the recasting of the Rachel Dawes character. Katie Holmes got a lot of unfair publicity during BATMAN BEGINS because of the media firestorm around her relationship with Tom Cruise. She even got a Razzie nomination. She is not this generation's answer to Bette Davis, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is actually the better actress of the two. But having already set up this character who is very crucial to Bruce's life, it's awkward to have another actress cast in that role. It's like trying to imagine anyone else but Ingrid Bergman falling in love with Humphrey Bogart during the Paris flashbacks of CASABLANCA. However, the role, already small and somewhat insubstantial, is a more diminished in this film than its predecessor, and it's only a minor annoyance to a practically perfect movie.This is the film we've all been waiting for, and it's the film we deserve. I hope you all take in the unforgettably exciting atmosphere of the crowded theater, and remember the greatness of Heath Ledger that is lost, but with this film, it'll never be forgotten.",7.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9977,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Critic and crowd pleaser raucously uninspiring,"Back to the movie, clearly the actors are first rate and the dialog is entertaining. I particularly enjoy the incarnation of The Joker by Heath Ledger, which may bring Heath a posthumous Oscar nod; the writers give him some clever lines... like the ""you complete me"" phrase in the above quote (from Jerry MaGuire). But you know what I'm not buying? I'm not buying that this Batman flick, because of it's dark humor, is better than other comic-book-inspired movies; aside from the rare Joker line, nothing in this movie is humorous, dark or otherwise. In fact it's uncommonly depressing. I suppose Knight is similar to the later Spider Man films, in which we're to solemnly consider the deep emotional conflicts presented to a post-pubescent boy who has been given superhuman powers.My friends, these are movies (and movie advocates) that take themselves way too seriously....For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2008",4.0,Anonymous,0.0007,0.9993,-0.9985,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Go see it in an IMAX theater!,"If you haven't seen The Dark Knight yet, just go see it in an IMAX theater. This superb action thriller is worth every cent of the gigantic screen. And the crystal clear resolution of the IMAX shots is astonishing. You can see through the windows of the well lit skyscrapers! One warning though: There are certain action scenes that might appear too busy on the screen for some viewers to capture entirely; after all, it's an eight-story tall screen. But it's OK to lose a little bit of details because most likely you'll want to watch the movie again.The two 70+ legendary actors are just amazing. Michael Caine said that he had all the funny lines at the London premiere, and he's absolutely right. He adds humor and wisdom to this dark film. Morgan Freeman plays the elegant scientist so well, and his subtle facial expression seems to tell people: I know what you're thinking; I know it all.Maggie Gyllenhaal did quite well, much better than Katie Holms. But she failed to convey the struggle in choosing between 2 men. But perhaps Nolan's idea of Rachel isn't a woman with strong emotions. She is an old friend of Bruce's, best friend since childhood. She admires Bruce for what he sacrifices (his normal life) to save Gotham. But she might never have loved him. She made it clear that life with dual identity wasn't the kind she wanted Bruce to lead. She didn't commit anything to him at the end of ""The Batman Begins"" except an ambiguous promise. So maybe we have to factor this in when we judge Maggie's performance.Christian Bale, our leading man, is very convincing in portraying a hero with moral burdens. He once said that he didn't have to act Batman's rage because of the headache caused by the tight mask. I can't say that he has ""acted"" well this time because it seems to me that he didn't have to act again given his recent news. Whether that's true or not, he is the best incarnation of Bruce Wayne / Batman, and I hope Nolan will write Christian a bigger part that lives up to its name in the 3rd installment, which I'm very much looking forward to.Overall, this is a movie that I don't regret seeing 3 times in theaters. Every time I got something new out of it. If you have the patience to watch a movie over 150 minutes, TDK is definitely the best choice of this summer.""The next most anticipated film"" submitted on July 28thThe Dark Knight is a movie worth seeing at least twice. No wonder it's breaking one record after another in the box office.The first time around, you'll be thrilled as you ride the roller coaster with many unexpected turns. Director Christopher Nolan has created such a suspense atmosphere that throughout the movie, you'll keep wondering what's next and you can't help guessing but you won't guess them all as the film is full of surprises. The awe-inspiring music, the spectacular skyscrapers of both Gotham and Hong Kong, the racing and flipping of cars and trucks, and the swift switches between scenes of simultaneous events which Nolan is famous for as his intriguing way of storytelling, all and all drive your adrenaline level high and heart beating fast; it leaves you little space to fully appreciate the wonderful acting of every actor. Except, of course, you'll be immediately overwhelmed by Heath Ledger's unprecedented and unsurpassable performance as the Joker. His portrayal will leave a long lasting impression in every viewer, fan of his or not.That's why you should see it again. This time, with the storyline in mind, you can relax while watching and you'll find that literally EVERY major actor, Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Maggie Gyllenhaal has done a superb job playing his / her character. Even those who play smaller roles deliver. Maybe the baleheads will find Christian not being seen enough in his titular movie, and that's probably the only small disappointment in this film for them. The real disappointment, and pity, in reality, is the death of Heath. Toward the end of the movie, you'll already start expecting the 3rd installment in which the 2 uncompromising enemies continue their entangled fight. But that's difficult to fulfill now because finding a replacement to play the Joker for the late actor is almost impossible (I personally think it's impossible, but let's give many talented young actors out there the benefit of the doubt). Whoever dares take this challenge is admirable and will be under tons of pressure trying to meet such a high benchmark, let alone exceeding it.The huge success of the film deserves celebrations, but hopefully it won't become a burden for Nolan and Bale and thus delay the next sequel, which will be the next most anticipated film. Setting high standards for themselves, they won't settle for something that doesn't surpass the Dark Knight. The long waiting process begins.Edited on August 4thTo answer Mr. Alex Billington's question whether TDK will beat Titanic, I think it's possible. This movie is my only one to see in theaters twice. And I've been invited to see the IMAX version by the friend who accompanied me to see it the second time. At first she questioned why I needed to see it twice, but now she's more fascinated than me. TDK has altered my personal movie-viewing habit and set the record as the only film that I believe I'll ever see 3 times in theaters. With the lackluster performance of the third Mummy, and no other major blockbusters opening this weekend, TDK may keep its reign for 4 weekends in a row. Even if TDK doesn't outsell Titanic in the box office, I predict it will on DVD.",,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"

I have no words but I will write a lot anyway!,"What can I say about The Dark Knight?Star #1 goes to Christian Bale for his appearance as Batman. Everything I ever thought of when I thought of Batman, Christian Bale brings to the table. He's cunning, a brilliant fighter, compassionate, yet conflicted, dark, lonely, and self righteous. While his almost beast-like voice grew a little tiresome, I felt like it fit nonetheless. I could go on forever about Christian Bale. He's the reason I went to see it in the first place (and by that I mean his hotness). But we're moving on . . .Star #2 goes to Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent. Eckhart completely surpassed my expectations for him. His portrayal was subtle but it was all we needed. We're shown immediately in the trailer that Dent is technically 'the hero' yet he just as messed up as everyone else in this film. His transformation during the film is quite believable and we all know that character transformations can go very wrong(anyone remember Spiderman Three?) I give Eckhart a mental high five for bringing depth to the cardboard comic book character.Stars #3 and 4 go to Christopher and Jonathan Nolan. I don't think I even need to go on. The cinematography was fabulous. The dialogue was incredible. The characters were deep and the actors didn't even have to do much work. Despite amazing performances from the whole cast, they would be nowhere in this film without the Nolans. I can't wait to see what they do next.Star #5 goes to Morgan Freeman. We've known he's a man for some time now but he emphasizes that fact in this film. No, he's not in it much but when he is, he steals the scene. Even Lucius Fox is complicated and almost dark in this film. After all, he is a liar and an accomplice to Batman's law breaking in the name of justice. I applaud him for so subtly bringing so much to the table.Star #6 goes to Michael Cain who has been Alfred well, forever. He was endearing and brought some much needed comic relief and lightness to this film. Cain was simply adorable and you could almost see the tight bond between him and Bruce Wayne. In other words, he simply made me smile.Star #7 goes to Gary Oldman as Detective Gordon. I didn't expect what he delivered. He too is conflicted about lying to his entire department about Batman, especially Harvey Dent. His friendship with Batman is so screwy, its borderline Holmes/Watson. Although . . . I'm not sure who would be who. Oldman's character is warm, gentle, and caring yet weary, exasperated, and troubled. I give him a mental high five as well for reminding us that most police officers are good people.Star #8 goes to the idea that the Nolans put out. They challenged all ideas of civilized society today without offending most anyone. The theme of the Dark Knight reminds us that once you remove society's rules, we are all just trying to survive and we will do anything to stay alive. You all know what scene I'm referring to and if you haven't seen it, you will know what scene I'm referring to. I left the theatre and immediately wanted to watch it again because I knew I missed a lot.And Star #9 goes to the great late Heath Ledger for his beautiful interpretation as the Joker. I'm not just saying he was amazing because he's dead. He reminded me of why people are afraid of clowns and he does it with a permanent sadistic smile. He challenges Batman and pushes him far past his limits while cynically proclaiming that they are exactly the same. Ledger caused me to wonder if everyone would be like the Joker once society's rules were gone. He also conflicted me throughout the whole film. Was I the only one who had to keep reminding themselves that Batman is the good guy? The reason I did not give it a ten is because yes, it was a very long movie and I think it could have been cut down. I also don't understand the purpose of Maggie Gyllenhaal. Who is Rachael?

Enough superlatives can't be used to describe how wonderful a cinematic experience this was. Christopher Nolan is taking over. While I wouldn't expect him to release movies to this level every time, once he continues with anything even close(as his portfolio is still small), then he'll become a legendary director. From the beginning, you're locked on to everything the movie has to offer. The mood is just dark and exactly how Batman should be portrayed....as in Batman Begins. I don't even know if I can watch the 1989 Batman now. Seems so...bland in comparison. Sorry Tim Burton, Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson but my goodness...The Dark Knight is a masterpiece. Despite all the hype, which usually spoils some movies as you expect too much, this is worth all the hype and more. I think Christian Bale is a superb actor and is cast very well due to his cool, calm and collective demeanor BUT Heath Ledger stole the show hands down. He had the mannerisms exact and he was a psychotic twist to what we've seen as the joker in the past. How did he do the voice? Just superb!! The acting was wonderful thanks to excellent casting, the music heard throughout just set the tone. The action scenes were well done, and the stunts were cool, especially the ones seen with his 'new' vehicle. The dialogue was excellent. Very well written. Everything is tied in nicely from beginning to end. It gets 10 out of 10 in my books. I have a Batman Begins poster in my room. Looks like it will be replaced. The Dark Knight is an instant classic!!""Let's put a smile on that face!""",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9979,"Action, Crime, Drama"
"If this is as great as everyone tells me, why do so many people agree with my criticisms!","Gotham is cleaning its act up, Batman is a successful crime fighting Legend, Jim Gordon is moving up the ranks and Harvey Dent is a tour-de-force for the city as its high flying District Attorney. Nothing can go wrong, can it? Well that it is except for a lunatic criminal called the Joker decides to bring chaos to Gotham, Batman is faced with a criminal who will stop at nothing to make a point and is seemingly always one step ahead of the Dark Knight, will he cross the line and kill to stop the madman and make Gotham safe, and will Bruce Wayne get to hang up his cape and get the happiness he deserves.After Batman Begins the scene was set for a bigger and better film to follow and after hearing all the hype I felt that this film could not fail ...I was very wrong. There are a number of issues that I had with the film that I have yet to hear a good defence for. The great films may not be liked by everyone for bizarre reasons but their criticisms are usually swept aside by the faithful. There are far too many errors in this film for it to pass such tests. I will address them one at a time, as one by one these spoilt the film for me.The first is that the film drags and drags and drags. Around the time of Batman's big decision of who he gets to save seems to be the perfect time to end it, on an Empire style ending, instead it goes on and on and we have about thirty to forty minutes extra to wrap everything up that the film simply doesn't need. End it with suspense, leave me on a high, but if I'm looking at my watch you've failed.Two, the performance of Heath Ledger is not all that. Yes, he is dead and this is sad, but the Joker we get in this film is sadly not the Joker of ""The Killing Joke"" or the Joker of ""The Dark Knight"", sadly it is somewhere in-between and this version is very mish-mashy, added to that the make-up changes from scene to scene when the jokers skin is supposed to be white all the time, also the make-up should make him look like he's smiling, DO YOU GET IT WRITERS, HE IS CALLED THE JOKER. Did he laugh that often in the film, I think not, he hardly smiled at all either, what's that for? For me, the big star turn in the film is by Aaron Eckhart who is magnificent as Harvey Dent and seems to steal every scene that he is in. Eckhart cranks the film up and makes it his own, and this is what increases the rating as it does.The action sequences that are so gripping in the first film are sadly lacking here as the editing to make it a lower rating and get more bums on seats have cut the films strongest feature to shreds.The last thing that really trashes the film for me is the end sequence with the Joker's final trap, as there is little explanation of how he has done this, are we expected to believe that the Joker is magic as that is what it feels like the director is saying. I'm all for big surprises but this was just too unbelievable, and I'm saying that about a film that has a man dressing up as a giant bat! Many of the people I have spoken to claim to love the film yet so few have any defence of the errors I speak of here, many of them Jump in and agree, and sometimes even add to the list, which annoys me for two reasons, because it will mean that more rubbish will get churned out that is supposed to be good and also because people's standards by accepting sub-standard films as good are lowering and we should always, as viewers, expect more, and pace, performance, writing and even make-up should all be first rate when $170 million dollars have been spent.Maybe many people feel that because there is so much hype for a film, and so much critical acclaim that they must be wrong for not liking it, when the truth is that the people who don't like it all that much are the ones who are right and those that just suck up to the critics view are very wrong. Thankfully I have been here before and faced exactly the same backlash 14 years ago for saying I didn't enjoy ""Jurassic Park"" which had similar levels of hype and got similar levels of public favour at the time of release. I find it interesting that it is now so very far down the rankings as, upon release, it was supposed to be the best film ever, according to the critics.No film could get a reaction like this on these boards without some element of over-reaction, and in this case it's to Ledger's death, the best time to judge this film will be in a year's time when the hype has died down, and for those who can admit they made a mistake to rethink their over-hyped ratings.Disappointing.",4.0,Anonymous,0.0005,0.9995,-0.999,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Not Exactly Citizen Kane,"The Dark Knight is a very good movie, and a very entertaining one. It's a film that leaves you feeling totally satisfied. But later, when you actually *think* about it, you may begin to wonder what you've actually seen.To be sure, the film has a number of major strengths. The sense of gritty realism is probably it's greatest asset. This is the superhero as a real-world phenomenon. The Batman of The Dark Knight is no more fantastic than, say, the James Bond of Casino Royale. (There's just one entirely needless bit of sci-fi - the whole thing with the cell-phone 'sonar' imaging. The film would be stronger without it.) Heath Ledger's performance is another big plus... though we shouldn't forget that Ledger is abetted by some very strong writing. It's a crowd-pleasing *part*, and we should be careful to spread the credit to all involved. I think Aaron Eckhart deserves mention as well; he's both likable and credible as the real square-jawed hero of the film.On the other hand, the film has some sizable (though not crippling) flaws.For starters, the story is relentlessly linear. In fact, there's barely a story at all. Nutjob Joker seeks to destroy crusading District Attorney Harvey Dent. That's about it. (Batman himself is almost incidental... which is not a bad thing.) Characterization is thin, to say the least. The Joker offers some hints at a back-story, but it's vague, self-contradictory and very, very limited. All the other roles are easily summed up in a single phrase. We've forgotten by now just why Bruce Wayne is so dedicated to fighting crime; it's taken for granted. And we never get much of a clue as to what makes Dent so fearlessly committed. Other characters simply go where the storyline demands. All this gives the film a breathless, streamlined velocity. But we need to admit that it ain't exactly Shakespeare... nor even Stan Lee.Scenically, the film is certainly impressive... especially if you see it in IMAX. (Although the constant shifts between IMAX and regular widescreen are a bit distracting.) One crucial visual element that really doesn't work, though, is Batman's costume. Despite an upgrade early in the film, it always seems stiff, cumbersome and unappealing. At one point, I was hauntingly reminded of Darth Vader. This Batman moves more like Iron Man than like Sam Raimi's spandex Spider-Man, or Ben Affleck's red-leather Daredevil.Finally, there's Christian Bale. He's much better here than in the dismal Batman Begins, and particularly good as the arrogant rich-boy Bruce Wayne. But he still doesn't bring much to the moderately important role of *Batman*. Physically, he gives off no feeling of strength; you never really believe he's a guy who could be punching it out with crowds of crooks every night. (Compare Daniel Craig in Casino Royale, or Matt Damon in the Bourne films; these guys have the Olympic physique a superhero would need.) When called upon to speak from behind the mask, Bale rasps unpleasantly, and his lips curl in a particularly ugly way. Admittedly, this Batman isn't intended to be *likable* (again, a good thing)... but a greater actor would have made him compellingly dark and brooding, rather than simply harsh and antisocial.All this may be nitpicking, but considering the hundreds of 10/10 ratings posted so far, I think a dose of reality is called for. The Dark Knight is an excellent film, no question... but not quite a work of diamond-like perfection. Let's appreciate it for what it is, rather than for what our enthusiasm would make it to be. Personally, I give it a solid 8/10, and reserve the perfect score for those perfect works of cinematic genius that do turn up every decade or so.",8.0,Anonymous,0.9978,0.0022,0.9956,"Action, Crime, Drama"
This Black Knight Is Indubitably A Great Film ...,"Dark as night and nearly as long, Christopher Nolan's new Batman movie feels like a beginning and something of an end. Pitched at the divide between art and industry, poetry and entertainment, it goes darker and deeper than any Hollywood movie of its comic-book kind  including ""Batman Begins,"" Mr. Nolan's 2005 pleasurably moody resurrection of the series  largely by embracing an ambivalence that at first glance might be mistaken for pessimism. But no work filled with such thrilling moments of pure cinema can be rightly branded pessimistic, even a post-heroic superhero movie like ""The Dark Knight."" So conclusion: It is a film of a crazy ambition because behind the myth of Batman and the power of a scenario of action movie hides a moral message rarely reached in cinema, a message of philosophic sublimation which sends back almost to the superman...",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9977,"Action, Crime, Drama"
'Why so serious?' - because this movie isn't like other comic adaptations,"I watched 'Batman Begins' and gave it ten stars out of ten. I watched 'The Dark Knight' and what am I supposed to do now? I can't add any stars to the rating system... This movie is breath-taking, brilliant, absorbing... just add all the other positive adjectives that come to your mind! A good two and a half hours of excellent film-making in which every second is placed as perfectly as it can be! The cast: awesome! Bale, Ledger, Caine, Freeman, Eckhart, Oldman, Gyllenhaal... The plot: superb! Not just an ordinary action-movie with endless sequences of explosions, brawls and shootings but thoughtful moments of incredibly fast events taking turns with subtle, extremely sinister situations, so perfectly combined that you are in serious danger of forgetting to breathe... The atmosphere is as dark as the title forebodes and you can virtually feel the terror the Joker spreads in Gotham City - by the way: the Joker is probably the best villain in a movie I have ever seen in my life and I take my hat before Mr. Ledger and thank him for having us left such a bombastic piece of acting as his legacy! Back to the movie: breathe out in the moments of (nonetheless)captivating silence, think about what happened - because the movie wants you to and that's what adds to his special status - and be prepared for the next wonderful sequence to come; the film is full of it and it has earned my personal 'Movie of the Year'-Award! I seriously doubt anything better can happen to the audience this year... and maybe next... and maybe... ;) 10+x/10",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9979,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Very dark and sad.,"I just got back from an advance IMAX screening of The Dark Knight down here in Sydney, it was a full house and I was forced to sit right at the front of the theater, which is not the best for IMAX viewing ! Anyway, the film is by far the darkest superhero film I have ever seen.Heath Ledger did excellent in his chilling portrayal of The Joker, every scene he was in brought a mix of dark humor and scariness to the table. Micheal Caine, Gary Oldman & Christan Bale also did quite well.Onto the bulk of the film, I felt the movie was going great up until the hospital blew up, from that point on some very unneeded action scenes took place. The film would have been MUCH better if they just went to the final scene and cut out the boat bit.The length was also a factor, many scenes could and should have been cut.Overall, this is a dark and depressing superhero flick with some excellent performances, but it falls apart a bit in the final act. 8.5/10 I liked Begins more.",,Anonymous,0.9987,0.0013,0.9975,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Greatest film of this generation,"The Dark Knight was, to say the least, an amazing comic book adaptation... But, that is to say the least. It was the greatest comic book adaptation to date, and simultaneously one of the greatest films of this generation. It is safe to say that big-budget blockbusters rarely deserve the level of commercial hype put in place to drive their monumental box office sales. This film is an exception to that rule. I stress the use of the term ""FILM"", because this was no ordinary movie. This is a modern day masterpiece, a three act opera that unfolds before you in high definition and surround sound. Director Christopher Nolan explores a blurred dichotomy of good and evil with an expertise rarely exhibited, while Christian Bale, Aaron Eckhart, and Heath Ledger combine for a timeless portrayal of twisted fate and fortune. While screening The Dark Knight, I was deeply taken by the raw depth of Heath Ledger's Joker. I couldn't help but feel privileged to be able witness this performance of a lifetime. Profoundly moving, and entirely entertaining, The Dark Knight has rightfully established itself as a film for the ages, a rare accomplishment indeed.",10.0,Anonymous,0.9989,0.0011,0.9978,"Action, Crime, Drama"
The Joke's On Us,"...for, simply put, this is to comic book/graphic novel adaptations what The Godfather, Part II is to gangster movies. Relentlessly dark, brooding, tangled, mythic, disturbing, none of that alternating, and then some. Long, too. It is neither uplifting nor a place to park the kids.I devoured my share of comic books when much younger, and felt obliged but not compelled to sample their motion picture adaptations. In particular, no fan of the Batman series am I. Tim Burton aimed for weird and hit the target. Joel Schumacher aimed for Ken Russell and missed oh so wide. Christopher Nolan and company got the keys to the franchise and did something certifiably different. Hat's off for that.In sum...About a half-hour too long, and that final half-hour was action-packed befuddlement capped by not one but two unnecessary speeches that were effectively blotted out by that packed action.Heath Ledger's performance will echo in your mind for some time to come. It had to have echoed in his own. Grant the man rest.So will, or should, the performances of everyone else, most notably Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman for their respectively surprising turns of character.With age Eric Roberts looks like Willem Dafoe, and Nestor Carbonell looks unnervingly like Peter Mark Richman.I believe we're close to breaking the sound barrier of digital FX, where you don't appreciate them 'til they're hurled at you and can't appreciate them when you do.I've heard my share of edited gunshots and explosions for the year and quite possibly the next two or three. But at least the violence wasn't stylized. If I wanted that I'd rent A Clockwork Orange.What awards this film will win will be well and truly earned. All the same I can't guess where the franchise will go next. I sincerely hope it's left where it is, with the goal of applying the same considerable attention and resources to finding, learning, articulating and displaying something novel. The participants in this film are surely capable of all of that...",7.0,Anonymous,0.004,0.996,-0.9921,"Action, Crime, Drama"
"Tries to hard to be the ""Syriana"" of superhero films...unfortunately","I went into this film with a fresh mind, having not heard much about it or any spoilerish stuff. Other than the unfortunate passing away of Heath, everything else was neutral with me.Wow did this movie try too too hard. It was like it was auditioning itself to become part of the rotation on the Bravo or AMC channel. There were just way too many unnecessary story lines involved here, all trying to make things more complex than they really were, all with that constant gloomy depressed feeling too, both staples of ""serious"" films. Don't get me wrong, it started off with a nice bang with the Joker, but soon after that Harvey Dent and his whole campaign issues became involved, then that whole storyline of the guy trying to frame Bruce Wayne came up, and then that whole byline about the commissioner's secret operation, and then the whole kidnapping of the Oriental mobster came up, and then the three-way romance between Bruce, Harvey, and Rachel came up, and so on and so forth. And that's not even including all the other segments involving Joker meeting up all the mobsters and following up on his big plan. You see what I mean, it was just trying to hard in too many areas all at once.Iron Man did it quite nicely by not taking itself too seriously. Yes there were fantastical parts in that film, but it never wavered too long on one issue or tried to have too many issues plague the script all at once.And that brings up another point about the dark knight. Was I only one a little offended at how the script just wanted us to so easily accept the Joker and his small crew doing so much with so little. I mean I just kept thinking that there's too many variables that have to be ignored in order for this to happen, but the movie sure makes it seem like everything should be instantly taken as fact.Problem with all the powerful mob bosses and their hundreds of men? Don't worry, Joker took care of that with his one little meeting with them. - Problem with trying to kill Harvey Dent, who's being escorted by nearly the entire Gotham City Police force? Don't worry, Joker and a few henchmen inside a truck can take care of that, all while somehow managing to block off entire sections of the city streets too. - Problem with trying to get out of jail? Don't worry, Joker already planned on having some guy with a live bomb inside of him, and timed everything to the second. - Problem with trying to get all of Gotham onto two ferry boats charged with explosives? Don't worry, Joker must've figured out some way to block off ALL highways and freeways leading in and out of Gotham, not to mention figuring out a way to stop all of the airlines, trains, and the entire US government and it's military power too. All with a just a few henchmen too.Anyways this movie get a 5/10 from out of me.",5.0,Anonymous,,,,"Action, Crime, Drama"
