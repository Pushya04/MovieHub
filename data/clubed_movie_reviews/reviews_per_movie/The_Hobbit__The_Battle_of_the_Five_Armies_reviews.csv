A clumsy ending,"The Battle of the Five Armies title is a great exaggeration of what an army entails. The movie is about more or less a skirmish with some rather imaginative weaponry. The plot goes sideways and after two three hours long previous films we get a two hours and a half mess that is half completely over the top battle scenes and the other half people talking out of their asses. It is pure chaos, where orcs are either mighty unbeatable beasts bred for war or cardboard armor wearing morons easily defeated by fishermen's wives and children, as the action demands. Things start to remind of Pirates of the Caribbean, and not only because it's the same actor doing kind of the same stuff.There is even a prolonged ending with Bilbo Baggings returning to the Shire, almost as if wanting to undo the good idea in the Lord of the Rings movies in which they removed the boring book ending with Saruman taking refuge in the Shire, and that portrays hobbits as petty bureaucratic creatures, rather than kind and resilient and courageous as declared everywhere else in the films. If I enjoyed the first two movies and wanted to see how it will all end, the third was a ridiculous failure, trying to do too much with too little: making a country brawl look like an epic battle, keeping the lighter more children oriented tone while killing characters and trying to express deeper heroic emotions, trying to somehow raise on the same level three organized military groups and a bunch of fishermen and animals and tying up lose ends that were there only to make this a trilogy rather than a pair of decent movies.It is now when all the jokes about the eagles made in good fun in the first two movies (and in Lord of the Rings as well) turn smirky, when the only logic to the plot and action seems to be the panic of production companies trying to achieve their financial goals rather than tell a good story. It is here where the disappointment that everyone talks about when referring to The Hobbit movies raises its ugly head and grows on the small mistakes of the previous two movies. So in order to enjoy the trilogy, one must somehow detach themselves from the ending and see it as an imperfect finish to an otherwise fun movie, maybe imagine their own.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"It's still not ""Lord of the Rings,"" but this is a fitting conclusion for a perfectly good fantasy trilogy","Did Peter Jackson really just conclude his second Middle Earth trilogy? His take on J.R.R. Tolkein's ""The Lord of the Rings"" was a completely exhausting adventure that in many ways feels like seven films, not three, while ""The Hobbit"" trilogy feels exactly like it is on paper: one straightforward adventure broken into three parts. ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" proves a fitting, exciting conclusion to this particular trilogy, but compared to the conclusion of ""The Lord of the Rings,"" quite frankly and pun intended â€“ it gets dwarfed.As with ""The Unexpected Journey"" and ""The Desolation of Smaug,"" ""The Battle of the Five Armies"" is another beautiful achievement in fantasy filmmaking, with stunning production value and an outstanding director in Jackson. It is creative, humorous, action-packed, brimming with talent and gravitas and so many of the things that made ""The Lord of the Rings"" the achievement it was. So why was this trilogy less acclaimed and somewhat anti-climactic? Part of this undoubtedly has to do with novelty. We've been to Middle Earth before, we've seen the makeup and the elaborate sets, we know how Jackson navigates a battle sequence. Although ""The Hobbit"" has new locales and new characters and was the first film series screened with a higher frame rate, it's not as groundbreaking an achievement. Also, that accomplishment set the bar high for ""The Hobbit"" given how many people have returned from ""Lord of the Rings"" on camera and off.Yet the real culprit is story. ""The Hobbit"" is a children's book, so splitting it into three parts is merely dragging out a streamlined plot of ""company seeks treasure and justice, company faces challenges along the way culminating in a mighty dragon, company overcomes odds."" The added subplots put more meat on the bones of the three films, especially ""Desolation,"" but did not necessarily add complexity or maturity to it.""Five Armies"" at least does not waste any time. The first act is entirely buildup to the titular battle with plenty of suspense as sides try to negotiate in order to prevent an unnecessary war when a much greater evil is growing in Middle Earth. After Smaug torches Lake-town, Thranduil (Lee Pace) and the Wood-elves march upon Erebor, where Thorin (Richard Armitage) has reclaimed his rightful throne. Thorin, however, is corrupted by his greed, and rather than help the displaced people of Lake-town, grows restless because his treasure's focal point, the Arkenstone, has yet to be found. Bilbo (Martin Freeman), who has been hiding the Arkenstone, sees Thorin's madness could cause a senseless war, which of course it does, only the battle takes a different shape when Azog the Defiler and his orc army arrives.So corruption and selfishness become dominant themes of the film until the final battle, which doesn't disappoint in scale, entertainment, or visual effects. What it doesn't do, however, is command a vested interest from the audience. And when the larger battle halts entirely in order to follow the main characters, it hurts the larger overall narrative, or rather, calls attention to the fact that there really isn't one at this point in the story other than ""kill the orcs."" Yes, the fate of Middle Earth is at stake, but we already know how things will ultimately play out.Someone who has never seen the films watching all six in order could be something special, though. ""Five Armies"" does make ""The Hobbit"" trilogy a rather strong bridge to ""Lord of the Rings,"" even in its last shot. In a way, Jackson acknowledges that that tale is the bigger story, the one that matters most. The parting message is kind of like ""we hope you enjoyed these three fun movies, but 'The Lord of the Rings,' that's where it's really at."" As moviegoers who witnessed ""Lord of the Rings,"" this doesn't quite work for us, because we wanted to go back to Middle Earth for something more, to build on the experience of ""Lord of the Rings."" ""The Hobbit,"" however, like any good prequel, is the foundation, not the next step, and because the story is so simplistic, it doesn't quite do enough for us on its own.""The Hobbit"" is a fun, small adventure filled with courage, danger, evil and love set in the world of ""Lord of the Rings,"" and ""Five Armies"" is that big scene at the end of the story where everything comes to boil. That's the gist of it. The rest is Jackson and his extraordinary cast and crew bringing that elaborate world back to life for us to enjoy one more time.~Steven CThanks for reading!

A Bit Weak at the End,"I really enjoyed the first two. I don't buy into the criticism that a 300 page book couldn't be made into a full blown trilogy. That said, I found the last episode way too full of battle scenes and gratuitous violence, big armies banging into each other, terrible orcs riding wolves, and the ultimate confrontation. In the process, all the charm that had been built up in the first two movies seemed to be dropped for a bunch of special effects. It starts well with the appearance of Smaug who fulfills his promise of destroying the town. But after that its a hodge-podge of romance and revenge and ultimately death. As this one ended, I literally felt, ""Oh, is that the end?"" Having read ""The Hobbit"" a couple of times, I knew what was going to happen, but it didn't quite work the way I thought it would. There was just something empty. Don't get me wrong, I could revel in the effort, but I can't say that this will stay with me for a long time.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The frustration of the 144 minutes,"What a difference an Extended Edition makes. For the first part we got some jolly embellishment. For The Desolation of Smaug we got bags more depth and character. For The Battle of the Five Armies, it may - I hope - be transformative. Because right now this feels like An Unfinished Journey.It's as if, after all the complaints about splitting a pamphlet of a novel into three parts, Peter Jackson is playing a joke on us: This is what you get when you ask for Middle-earth-lite. Characters we've come to love or loathe arc into nothing; others (e.g. Beorn and Radagast) are given literally seconds of screen time; and for the first time in this prequel trilogy, a whole chapter (The Return Journey) is pretty much elided entirely.I'd like to be clear on my admiration for what Peter Jackson has done with The Hobbit so far. For all The Lord of the Rings' mythic grandeur and complex world-building, there's a warm geniality and brisk impetus to these lovingly crafted films. And those qualities are married to a thematic depth missing from its bedtime story source. Home and borders are themes that have run through this trilogy, from Bilbo's (Martin Freeman) heartfelt declaration of solidarity at the end of An Unexpected Journey, to Kili's (Aidan Turner) fevered speech to Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) as she heals his wounds in Desolation, when they realise reconciliation is possible. Heck, I even like the addition of Tauriel - though her unsatisfying conclusion is perhaps typical of a final chapter that too often fails to tie up its loose ends.The movie kicks off from precisely where the second ended, with the dread dragon Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch) descending upon Laketown. The citizens flee but nothing can stop the cataclysm - until a certain someone finds an ingenious way to pierce the beast. Then there's nemesis #2: Sauron (also Cumberbatch). We get to see some familiar faces face-off with this faceless monstrosity.The story then enters its most intriguing phase: a kind of psychodrama involving Thorin (Richard Armitage) and his sickening relationship with gold and power. It's the one time we really glimpse that signature Jackson oddness, in a wonderful hallucinatory sequence where Thorin imagines he's sinking in a lake of gold.The narrative follows the book fairly closely. This was, after all, the stage of the story where Professor Tolkien finally foregrounded politics and ethics and the machinations of characters ahead of adventure. The film is at its most successful in the quieter moments, as Thranduil (a subtle Lee Pace) ponders the duty of the elves; as Bard (a brooding Luke Evans) comes to the gate of the mountain to plead for peace; and as Thorin struggles with his ""dragon-sickness"" (i.e. greed), while Bilbo wrestles with the dilemma of what to do with a certain stolen gemstone.Thorin was presented at first as this trilogy's Aragorn. But over time we've learned of the dangerous pride that ruined his grandfather. Thorin's hubris and arrogance is in stark contrast to Bilbo's very relatable and achievable traits of decency and humility. The gulf between them is intriguing and wisely plundered for drama. Armitage and Bilbo provide the best performances of the film - mostly internal; mostly in the eyes - and their farewell is one of the more moving moments in a trilogy that has largely prioritised humour over pathos.The battle itself is undoubtedly impressive - great roaring hordes punctuated with spectacular giants - but in a sense it compounds the problem of the relatively truncated runtime. What was already the shortest Middle-earth film is rendered artificially even shorter by the fact that there's 45 minutes of virtually wordless fighting. By now we should all be braced for Super Legolas and his physics-defying fighting style. That reaches new heights here; as he sprints up a crumbling bridge like he's on the wrong escalator, it's like some sort of visual satire on the weightlessness of CGI.With its last bastion and swarming armies, the titular battle resembles The Return of the King's Pelennor finale - yet that movie took breath between its showdowns. Galadriel vs. Sauron; Legolas vs. Bolg; Thorin vs. Azog... it's like we're watching someone finish off a video game but we're powerless to stop them skipping the tension- or character-building cutscenes. Moreover, the dubious editing decisions create some strange and jolting juxtapositions and tonal lurches, and negate the sense of time passing or of great distances being crossed.The result is a film that really earns its status of ""theatrical cut"", insofar as it resembles many a boisterous blockbuster. This is fairly damning criticism for a Middle-earth movie, usually so luxurious and layered in its sense of a unique world. There's plenty of meat here - but where are the bones that hold it all together? 11 months away, perhaps.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Peter Jackson's Epic Six-Movie Tolkien Series Ends with a Disinterested Shrug,"Finally, Bilbo Baggins returns to the Shire. After three bloated movies originating from around 300 pages of content, we've reached the end and I'm so glad to be done with it all. After a total of six movies set in Peter Jackson's Middle Earth, I'm totally fine with never hearing the word Hobbit again. His HOBBIT series concludes with the grand finale, THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES. When we last saw Bilbo (Martin Freeman), Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), and their company of dwarven companions, they had been left to gape helplessly as the dragon Smaug (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch) got tired of chasing them through the mountain kingdom of Erebor and took to the skies to burn neighboring Laketown to cinders. This movie rejoins the action at that very moment, abandoning the dwarfs to focus on Smaug and local hero Bard (Luke Evans), who chooses to engage the dragon. Ten or so minutes later, the whole dragon plot that kept us trudging to the theater for these movies is resolved and we spend the next three hours on the titular battle. You see, Thorin immediately begins to succumb to what the dwarfs call ""dragon-sickness"" and what us normal folk would call ""greed"". He's got his rightful kingdom back with more gold than he could ever need, and now he refuses to share it with anyone. The men of Laketown, led by Bard, come knocking in hopes of at least getting some gold for their dwarven-caused dragon troubles (i.e. the incineration of their entire town) and Thorin refuses. Even the woodland elves of Mirkwood Forest come stomping in with an army to demand a share. And, of course, the orc commander Azog has unfinished business with Thorin, having devoted two full previous movies to hunting the would-be dwarven king in hope of ending his bloodline. So all of these armies converge on the front lawn of Erebor forÂ…wait for itÂ…the battle of the five armies.Six movies deep into this franchise and I can safely say THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES is my least favorite of the bunch. I was so burned out on Middle Earth by the time this movie came around that I refused to see it in the theater. It's the only Peter Jackson/Tolkien movie that I never saw in the theater. I didn't bother watching it until the extended editions were released. In a movie that already feels like 90% filler, I can only imagine what had been added after the theatrical release. Sadly, most of this movie is utterly forgettable. The visual effects are impressive and the 45 minute final battle sequence certainly looks good, but did we need any of this? I don't think so. And, come on, 45 minutes is just too much. That's 45 minutes of CGI swarms of dwarfs, elves, orcs, and men hacking and slashing at each other and the occasional diversion to see what our heroes are doing so the story can keep pushing on. This means that every so often we'll break way so we can seeÂ…I don't knowÂ…Legolas (Orlando Bloom) hanging upside down from a giant bat monster while swinging his arms wildly to slice and dice a bunch of cartoon monsters that aren't really there. If I sound biased against this movie, it's because I believe its existence to be completely unnecessary and the whole exercise of creating it a gratuitous waste of time for Jackson and his crew. Tolkien's tale could've been handled in two better-paced films. I've been against the heavy use of CGI in these movies since AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY was released and this film just shoves it in my face with unmercifully long sequences of those same hated CG effects bouncing off each other. Would it have killed them to use some of those amazing practical costume/makeup effects for orcs in the foreground to give it an added sense of realism?THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES is only really interesting for the first act and the final act. Everything in the middle could've been trimmed generously. Unfortunately, when the big tragic moments begin to happen in the final act of the battle, I'm so worn out from the battle itself that they hold no weight. By that point, I'm just wishing we could skip to the end. THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES isn't a horrible film but I can't imagine it rising to the top and becoming anyone's favorite Jackson/Tolkien movie. It's got some nice stuff in there. Martin Freeman is still perfect for the role of Bilbo, even if he has nothing to do here. I loved the addition of Billy Connolly to the cast as Thorin's cousin Dain and I loved his behind-the-scenes interviews even more, where he admits that he never cared for Tolkien's work and freely mocked anyone who did. Smaug is still awesome for what little time we're given with him, and Jackson even found a way to shoehorn Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, and Christopher Lee into the series one last time. If I remember the novel correctly, Tolkien spares us the full details of the battle, choosing to knock Bilbo out when the action starts and filling him in later. In my ideal cut of Jackson's HOBBIT series, we'd get the same treatment. Bilbo is knocked unconscious and the movie would fade out; we fade in, the battle is over, the surviving characters fill us in on what happened in the form of a flashback montage. Keeps the movie a pleasant length and spares us from battle fatigue. In retrospect, I still enjoy Jackson's HOBBIT movies. The first one is enjoyable enough and was actually pretty solid. This third one thoughÂ…ouch. An epic six movie series and it ends with a shrug. That's the real disappointment.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Movie ratings are so subjective...,"Although I really enjoyed the first and second one, I didn't want to watch the third one because pretty much everyone I knew said it was disappointing. Well I watched it today and was so disappointed in myself for giving too much credit to what other people think over what Peter Jackson presented through the film's two predecessors. The film was really fast paced and didn't have any dragging lagging boring scenes. There was always something going on that had my full attention, not to mention very emotional and memorable ones that were hard to find in films that I've watched over the past 2 years. Everyone comes from different backgrounds so obviously not everyone's going to like or dislike the same movie, but I thought this one really had depth and I regret not seeing it in theaters. Peter Jackson's films only get better and better IMO.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A fitting send off to the greatest fantasy film series ever.,"Now I personally enjoyed the first two hobbit instalments as much as each movie of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, though without a shadow of a doubt the original trilogy is far superior (probably due to the fact the book it is based on, is far stronger) I still find each of them incredible films and after the agonising and excruciating cliff- hanger of the Desolation Of Smaug, I was highly anticipating the third concluding chapter: The Battle of the Five Armies.The Battle of the Five Armies forsakes the tradition of prologues that would often go back in time from the main narrative and instead thrusts us into the action, sending us with a flurry of excitement into Smaug's attack on Laketown, it is truly a spectacle to watch, building up the suspense and then being the perfect pulse racing build up and is one of the standout set pieces of the year as we finally see Smaug the terrible lay wake to the town, and as the title card appears over the ruined Erebor, the film continues to be the ultimate goodbye to Middle Earth, high on energy, whizzing through scenes at a breakneck pace until the credits roll.In an attempt not to reveal any spoilers about the film, I will not delve into anymore of the plot events, needless to say this movie has countless scenes that Jackson is known for. He masterfully strings together the best elements of his Middle Earth films into one package. Amazing characters with brilliant performances, standout and beautiful settings and design of Middle Earth, a beautiful epic yet emotional soundtrack and of course: incredible action set pieces to make one visual masterpiece. Jackson who has had two films worth of build up really tests the characters to their limits. Thorin has more to do than ever before and Armitage plays the part perfectly, not to forget Martin Freeman, who has a stunning emotional moment which had the audience blubbering with tears. Whilst the previous cast all fulfill their roles masterfully, Evangeline Lilly and Aidan Turner both continue this slightly clichÃ© romantic subplot but one that is given far more weight in this movie and really contributes to the plot this time and does not feel tacked on which did seem to occur with Desolation of Smaug.The action as well is the best of the whole middle earth saga, the battle of the Five armies feels like Jackson looked at Minas Tirith, saw everything that worked and decided to turn it up a notch. Full of epic moments, awesome fights, giant armies clashing and the final showdown with the long awaited Thorin vs Azog does everything right with brilliant performances all around and the best one on one action scene in the series between Legolas and Bolg is a pure delight to watch.The film for me embodied what I loved about: The lord of the rings. Whilst the action is marvellous and the best of the series, it's the emotional tone that ends the last ten minutes that makes The Battle of the Five armies such a brilliant goodbye as it is the end to the Hobbit tale, whilst still being a set up for the Lord of the rings and being one last farewell to the series that has touched so many viewers across the globe as Billy Boyd ends the series with a nostalgic note with his song.My only few complaints is that much like in the Desolation of Smaug, the lonely mountain theme from An Unexpected journey does not appear, instead the 'house of durin theme' seems to be the most prominent, though I have understood it could be a copyright issue which in that case cannot be helped. Also though the film went by in a blur, I wish it could of been longer, most of the dwarfs don't get as much screen time as they should of and the ending feels like such a flash but perhaps that may be because I was desperate not to leave Jackson's middle earth vision for the last time, there was a lot of questions that were left unanswered admittedly and it does feel like they took the climax of the second movie, when the Hobbit was only two films and then extended it for as long as they could without overstaying their welcome, but these are all very minor gripes in what is a magnificent experience to see on the silver screen.The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is the ultimate send off for the Middle Earth saga. In a trilogy where the quality of films has got progressively better, the Hobbit which easily could of been a supplement to the Lord of the rings, feels like a significant half of the Middle Earth saga. It's crammed with nolstagia, especially when Shore reuses some classic themes. There's some minor gripes but I frankly don't care, this is Middle Earth at it's finest and it ticked all the boxes of what I wanted to see and what I wanted it to do. It was an emotionally powerful, spectacle filled ending to the greatest fantasy cinematic series of all time.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Get on with it,"The one overriding feeling I have whilst watching this movie is ""Get on with it!""The dragon is killed in the first ten minutes. And then you're left wondering what's next?Lots of talking and the odd skirmish. Galadriel's scenes are excellent. But once she leaves you're left wondering what's next? You begin to stare at your watch. At 50mins in you realise there's almost two hours to go.Cue more talking. Discussions that are unnecessary. Scenes that could be omitted.It could've been fast paced. It could've raced and heightened the drama. The story is there but it's given too much space to breathe.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Nice finish to an Over Extended Film,"It is without question The Hobbit did not need to be made into a three part film series... After all, given the book size of the Hobbit Compared to The Lord of the Rings... The Hobbit Should have been workable into one extended Movie or two at the most. If Jackson would have sun the story of The Lord of the Rings like he did the Hobbit, We would still be waiting for the last two movies in his twelve part series...So with that off my chest..This still is a TRUE CLASSIC FILM to be placed in the same titles as The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. The Cinematography was excellent. The special effects pretty much flawless and acting excellent. The Story was intriguing if not a bit over-told with characters and plots a bit beyond the book. However, even these over embellishings are happily accepted. In fact, now that the series is over, I wish Jackson would have made a longer Lord of the Rings. Is simply can not get enough.. It is over! Soon to be delegated to Blue Ray, then sweep to the DVD bin at WalMart along with the rest of our favorites. Enjoy the series now... It will be a long time before you see another classic like Tolkien on the Big Screen.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A fitting adieu to Middle Earth, but one that lacks that special something","I should have loved this film. One of the aspects I love most about Return of the King, my favourite of Jackson's adaptations and one of my favourite films of all time, is the sprawling, mass fantasy battle scenes and The Battle of Five Armies is pretty much one elongated battle scene. However, there's something that's not quite right.It's not the lack of emotion, characterization or plot. Indeed, there are plenty of those, there is just something I just can't put my finger on that stops the film from being truly epic. Perhaps it is because, for me at least, this film will always live in King's shadow but, really, where I think the film falls down, is that the battles simply aren't done well enough. The context is not explained very well, the actual engagements not that exciting too much repetition and, most crucially, too much cutting away from one place to another. This cutting worked fine, well, even, in Two Towers between the crucible of Helm's Deep and the quiet conversation of the Entmoot, but, here, there are just too many places that the actions flits between. I appreciate this is a battle of five armies, and that there are plenty of characters, but, sadly, the action did seem to be all over the place. And the repetition I mentioned earlier: a huge portion of the film seemed to be entirely composed of either someone running to warn others, a main character leading the charge into battle, and several one-on-one battles. The latter may be entertaining, sure, but there is a line which is stepped over in this film.The ending, too, seemed like it was rushed by the filmmakers, especially when we consider that we don't actually find out what happens to the Arkenstone in the end. Many people criticised Return of the King's dragged out ending, but that was full of emotion and was a fitting, yet sad, farewell. Here, where not only does Bilbo say farewell to Gandalf and the Dwarfs, but where we say an almost certain farewell to Middle Earth, the end is far too brief and unlikely to instil emotion. Though, it is, to be fair, nicely linked into Fellowship.Ultimately though, the film has plenty of positives. Despite being full of battle sequences, Jackson fits in plenty of emotional scenes and develops many of the characters fantastically. In particular, Armitage's Thorin is different and darker, yet changes a great deal throughout the film - all in all, a fantastic performance. There's plenty of typical Jackson humour, some brilliant cameos and some great nods to the Lord of the Rings films and some elements of the film's production, which die-hard fans will no doubt pick up on with a smile. It's also important to realise that, whilst it's easy to criticise the long battle sequences, they are entertaining, and keep the pace of the film up throughout.So, whilst it is easy to concentrate on the negatives and, in particular, the lack of a Grey Havens-esque adieu to Middle Earth, The Battle of Five Armies is still a great film and a fitting end to what has been a true achievement: a series of beautiful film adaptations that many will be sad to see end.Ed",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Spectacular Finish To An Epic Journey,"So I went to The Hobbit marathon. Yes, my fangirling has reached the level where I'm willing to sit in a theater for nine hours straight.First of all, seeing the first two movies on the big screen again (and for the last time) was a wonderful experience. Seeing all three on the big screen in one night? Very cool. And getting to watch the character transformations and story lines in a row, fantastic. The effects, casting, acting, setting, action... everything was good.Martin Freeman should win some major awards for his acting... actually everyone should. They're all incredible. I must say, I cried for most of the last fifteen or so minutes. If you've read the book etc., you know why. If not, please go so you can cry too.The action and battle scenes are captivating, intense, and extremely fun to watch. We get more info about Sauron, which makes me very happy. We also get more Legolas and Tauriel, and let's be honest, who doesn't want more Elvish epicness?There were a few moments I could have done without, and a few moments where the CGI seemed off, but other than that, I honestly couldn't ask for a better movie. I feel like braiding my hair and learning to wield a sword now.People complain about these movies so much, but honestly, this is as good as it gets when it comes to book adaptations.9/10Once again, thank you Peter Jackson.

Too much already,"The gems in this movie, the best of the Hobbit three, can't offset the ridiculous running time and pointless filler added to artifically expand the running time. The Hobbit, much shorter than any of the Trilogy, only had one full time movie in it. Somewhat fortunately a lot of the meat of the real story was left for this finale. I thought a lot about this - this is the tell: in the Lord of the Rings movies there were extended battle sequences but not extended personal battle sequences, which sort of exposes the attempt to fill the time; I found some of these personal battles tedious. In the LOTR movies the problem was cramming all of the material into the allotted time. Here it's the opposite, so we see too many individual fight sequences which last too damn long. Dain of the dwarfs was spectacular and Thranduil king of the Woodelves very effective. The battle svenes are impressive when kept short. But the source material just isn't up to the LOTR and Jackson certainly couldn't make up the difference.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Far From A Fitting Conclusion. Disappointment In Every Sense.,"Here we are at last, at the end of all things! What was originally envisioned as a two-part film adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit eventually finishes as another trilogy in the Middle- Earth saga despite the fact that unlike The Lord of the Rings, this novel could've easily worked out as a single feature & certainly wasn't vast enough to warrant three films; a mistake that became pretty evident when the first chapter was criticized by many for its bloated length.For me however, An Unexpected Journey was still an impressive commencement of The Hobbit film series for it closely followed the events of the book, kept the changes within the realms of Tolkien's spirit & was a largely satisfying cinematic experience despite its obvious flaws. The journey downward began with The Desolation of Smaug which absolutely slaughtered the novel in a manner that was plainly insulting to Tolkien & added even more insult to injury by abruptly ending at one of cinema's most frustrating cliffhangers.And so after a wait of another year, we come to the third & final instalment of The Hobbit film series but instead of a satisfying closure, what we get is a terribly written & horribly executed premise inflated to epic proportions which, apart from confirming that expanding this single-film story into three features was indeed a stupid move by the filmmakers, also brings the Middle-Earth franchise to its all-time low for there is nothing in this second sequel that works out in its favour.The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies begins with what should've been the ending of The Desolation of Smaug but wraps up the fiery wrath of Smaug even before the film's subtitle appears on the screen. The plot then follows Bilbo Baggins & the Company of Dwarfs who after reclaiming their kingdom prepare for an impending war against elves n men who just want their share of the treasure but when a greater threat arrives at the Lonely Mountain, they all are left with a choice to unite against the common enemy or be destroyedHelmed by Peter Jackson for one last time, the final chapter in the Middle-Earth saga is also the weakest as the director completely abandons all the core elements of storytelling to rely solely on a series of eye-popping visuals & CGI-laden battles to carry its story forward. The screenplay continues the slaughter of its source material by stuffing the narrative with needless fillers while the remaining contents of the book are either presented in an overly exaggerated fashion or discarded in its entirety.Coming to the performances, it's only Martin Freeman & Ian McKellen as Bilbo Baggins & Gandalf the Grey, respectively, who leave a better impression than the others but then their role is somewhat limited in the finished product. The most unexpected disappointment comes from Richard Armitage who played Thorin Oakenshiled amazingly well in the previous two chapters yet here he seems pretty much clueless for the most part & delivers a laughable performance.The supporting characters are handled so poorly by the writers that even after three films, which totals over eight hours of runtime, many might still struggle in recalling the correct names of all the dwarfs. The first half of the film also deals with the corrupting power of greed which is pretty ironic considering that the very existence of this third chapter is a result of greed on the part of its creators. The only thing that doesn't disappointment in any manner is Howard Shore's score.On an overall scale, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is far from a fitting conclusion to The Hobbit trilogy & is a disappointment in every manner. Poorly directed, terribly written, needlessly bloated, overflowing with excessive CGI, lacking in substance & featuring some cringeworthy performances, there's so much one can complain about this finale but where this film or The Hobbit trilogy as a whole fails is exactly where The Lord of the Rings triumphed gloriously; its faithfulness to the works of J.R.R.

The weakest of all Peter Jackson's Tolkien adaptations,"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is the weakest of all Peter Jackson's Tolkien adaptations. Even though this is the shortest of the Middle-earth movies, the story drags on as if it were the longest. But I guess that's what you get when you stretch out one book into three movies. In addition, the battle scenes are so computer generated that they look like in-game cinematics. It's a shame that this film series had to end on this note.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not the best one out of the trilogy but still okay,"I am not going to say anything about Tolkien or whatever like some other angry reviewers because I don't care. I will never get why people have to compare a book and a movie. We all know a book is almost always better then a movie so why in the hell if you read the book you still want to watch the movie that you know won't be as good? I didn't read the book, so I just watched the movie. It's for sure not the best one out of the trilogy but I was still entertained though and that's what it's all about to me. Okay sometimes I thought things could have been much better, like the battle between a couple of hundred thousand creatures without or almost without a single drop of blood spilled. But saying this movie is a complete disaster is ridiculous. I knew what to expect and that's what I got. Nothing more, nothing less. To me those movies are just too long, and that's about the only critique I'm going to write about. For the rest I enjoyed the fantasy world of the different kind of creatures. If you hate fantasy just don't watch this kind of movie then.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
IMDb-Ratings mean nothing to me now .. its official,"In which universe is this a 1-star-movie ... This was one of the best films ever made .. its for sure in my top 15 list .. I am really tired of people complaining about very stupid things ... they will now complain about my English for sure ...For me, the CGI is very well done .. I don't know in which theater did you see it .. but in mine it was great .. have you ever seen someone walking on ice in real life before?? .. its exactly the same way it looked in the film ..I saw the movie twice and the second time was even more enjoyable .. planing to see it again this week .. I am a big fan of LOTR and I knew the the Hobbit will not be as perfect as LOTR .. This actually helped me enjoying the movies and they are still better than 90% of the recent movies .. Peter Jackson is the best director and no one could have done better work than he did .. Stop blaming him for everything ..I once believed in the IMDb-Ratings but after seeing those reviews, I made a second thought .. I can understand people giving 8 or even 7 stars but 1 star??? how can any one take your opinion seriously after that?",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Great finale, if you watch it with open mind.","This movie was a great finale to the Hobbit trilogy. Yes, there are a few drawn out battle sequences, too much CGI, and little plot, but what'd you expect it to be? People seem do despise it because of the CGI, the overly-embellished story because they compare it to the Lord of the Rings. It is not as good as the Lord of the Rings even remotely, but that's because it's a children's book. Even though Peter Jackson has made some controversial decisions, he has still pulled off what no other directed could do. He brought Middle Earth to life once again. I urge you to watch it. It has great acting and amazing directing techniques. The finale of the Hobbit is a movie that you either love or hate. Personally, putting all the CGI and filler aside, it was a great end to the Hobbit trilogy.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fairly consistent action carries it along, even if there is little to it and even impacting moments are lessened by the relentlessness","Perhaps it is me getting older but I do wonder if I was too kind on the original Lord of the Rings films in light of how disappointed I had been with the Hobbit films. Maybe because it was all new and different, or maybe they were genuinely better films than these. Anyway, as the Company continues their mission, so too did I return for the conclusion of this trilogy; although it must be said that I did not rush to it or have a great deal of excitement. The cliff- hanger from the previous film did win me over though, plus I wanted to see it through.The opening sequence picking up on Smaug's attack on the town turned out to be pretty impressive; okay we still have people surviving impossible special effects, but Smaug was a strong part of the previous film and remained so here. There is a feeling of anti- climax after this sequence finishes, but the story continues and builds reasonably well as we see the various armies position themselves (albeit many seem to be able to appear by magic at the drop of a hat). With various action sequences this leads us into many fight sequences with lots of movements and CGI. All of this is reasonably okay but it never seems to stop, and gradually I found myself sort of numbed by it. I think it was the ongoing lack of consequence and depth to it all that did it, because technically it all does look impressive but yet it feels very much like a video game too many times.The feeling of lack of consequence was a surprise to me though, particularly since we had major characters dying â€“ so in theory that should be a surprise and an impact. Unfortunately for me and the film, most of these are hurt by me frankly not being that engaged with some of these characters and their specific stories, while the delivery of these moments tended to be overly done, so they didn't have a genuine impact so much as a melodramatic one. With the battles I also found that the film didn't seem to convey the sense of scale it should have done. It produces plenty of crowd shots and sweeping cameras, but most fights seem very small and disconnected from the bigger picture; they still work for what they are, but they felt like the film was smaller by virtue of them.The cast are mixed but mainly everyone does what they do behind heavy costume and make-up, and with lots of green-screen work. The problem is more that the most interesting characters generally don't get the most time â€“ in particular it was a shame that Freeman did not get enough to do considering how good he was throughout. Armitage is good as Thorin, but mostly people were a blur of ears and facial hair (depending on their race). Lilly and Bloom were the ones that stuck in the mind for the wrong reasons â€“ I found them dull.So the trilogy ends and being honest I am not too sad to see it go. As a film there is probably enough action and dramatics to carry it through the time, but at the same time this is the issue with it. The relentless CGI-heavy action wore me down somewhat, and as I didn't really engage with the story due to the previous films, it was hard to do much here even if some of the specifics offered hope. It is solidly good enough for fans to feel they finished out the story with a bang, but for me it was another very expensive and technologically impressive so-so film in the trilogy.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
The sad story about The Hobbit franchise,"I have just watched the new video game ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the five armies"" at the theater and tried to stop myself from writing about it, because this video game does not deserve this attention, but I still am going to do this in memory of Peter Jackson's ""The Lord of the rings"" which was truly the reason why I gave the new trilogy a chance.""Frodo: I can't do this, Sam.Sam: I know. It's all wrong. By rights we shouldn't even be here. But we are. It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger, they were. And sometimes you didn't want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something, even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't. They kept going. Because they were holding on to something.Frodo: What are we holding onto, Sam?Sam: That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo... and it's worth fighting for.""And this quote says it all...But let me rephrase that. I have just witnessed how Peter Jackson (due to his own meanings or pushed by the new studio bossing around) has beheaded the little faith I had in him. The third Hobbit installment brought me to laughter, anger and almost to tears because of its outright stupidity and insipidness. And to stop generalizing, I'm going to put some points in front. First of all Peter Jackson has indeed committed crimes against the true story and characters from the children's book ""The Hobbit, or There and Back Again"". Too many people have seen this coming since we saw the first movie (which by the way was the least miserable from the three pieces). The imaginative character of Tauriel and the ludicrous relationship between the elf and the dwarf Kili is such a ""gem"" in this set of tragic mistakes that I must not say more. Mr. Jackson thoughtfully incorporated made-up parts in the story which didn't only made these movies look silly, but they destroyed his own credibility as a director loyal to Tolkien and to the fans. Yes indeed, three films will make much more money than one film. But this will never bring Jackson to the high place which he held in the hearts of the fans and in the minds of the critics. ""The Return of the King"" took all 11 Oscars for which it was nominated namely BECAUSE it was true to the books. J.R.R. Tokien's writings are true mirrors of the human nature and history and are indeed beautiful examples of how a person can relay humanity. None such occurred in at least the second and the third Hobbit films. I think that we saw a fantasy equivalent to the Avengers' stupidity. Still ""The Avengers"" was mostly true to its origins. Which is why ""The Battle of the Five armies"" cannot win the audience only with perfect character design, major battles, wonderful music and brief winks towards ""The Lord of the Rings"". The intended soul of the new trilogy - the friendship, the loyalty to comrades and keeping the given promise - were vaguely affecting the viewers back at the theater. Not only because the director and the actors did not meant what they were showing us, but also because it was NOT true. There is no such big emphasis in the book on these highlighted moments. Thus there is such a logical fiasco in front of us.Maybe I am too harsh on this movie and on Peter Jackson. Maybe I am just a fan of Tolkien who feels hurt, because the book material of J.R.R. Tolkien was treated like a source of money. But I think that as Sam said before in The Two Towers - ""Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something, even if you were too small to understand why."" And Jackson just had to do one movie true to the book. Nothing else. Maybe it would have been less successful than the previous trilogy. I think that it would have not earned any awards at all. But it would have been still an interesting piece to be seen and the true fans of Tolkien's work would have liked it. As a matter of fact I think that most of the people would have liked compared to the situation now. The true story is always emotionally overwhelming and mindfully compelling. So what am I holding onto? The good story? The loyalty to the book? No, I am holding onto the truth of creativity and artistry. There is some good in this world and it's worth fighting for!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Hobbit Has Ruined Middle-Earth,"The Hobbit: The Battle Of The Five Armies was totally inaccurate to the much loved, already created fantasy story.

'There can be only one LOTR and it does not share power' - Gandalf the Grey,"Alright, let's get down to it, The Hobbit - Battle of the Five Armies!!This was Jackson's movie which was inspired from Tolkien's works. That's it, inspired!!! Nothing more. LOTR on the other hand was a near perfect adaptation. So folks cut PJ a little slack and watch it for the movie it is. Do not compare it to the book and do not place it next to LOTR.Yes, the whole Tauriel-Kili phase looked dull and forced but that was my only problem. Martin Freeman, Richard Armitage brought their characters to lives and Benedict Cumberbatch JUST stole the show as SmaugI really liked the inclusion of Legolas and how PJ cleverly linked 'The Hobbit' as a prequel to the LOTR series by mentioning 'Aragorn' The battle scenes were really well done (And NO, CGI wasn't tacky) and I really would watch it again, for the visuals and the fact that it is the last goodbye to Middle EarthTHANK YOU PETER JACKSON, YOU HAVE DONE A MARVELOUS JOB",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Ending to the Middle-Earth Saga,"The Lord of the Rings trilogy was one of the best film series ever to be made in terms of its epic proportions, grandiose score, intricate weaving of stories, and CGI. Peter Jackson did a great job interpreting the three Tolkien novels and putting them up on the big screen, a great feat done with great success.When I heard that the Hobbit, originally one Tolkien book, was going to be split into three films just like the Lord of the Rings, I was surprised and worried about how they could expand one novel into 3 full-length feature films. So going in to the movies, I did not expect them to follow the book 100% - I expected changes to be made and additions inserted here and there to provide more excitement or emotion to the story.I have heard a lot of people write and complain about how bad the last Hobbit was, but given the framework of its development and that it was supposed to be much longer than anyone expected, people should not be going into this moving expecting it to be a great nod to Tolkien, but rather one for Peter Jackson. He wanted it to be longer, he wanted to add his own creative flare to it, and he did.I found that the last Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies, was a great film. Obviously, it doesn't stick to Tolkien's Hobbit in its entirety and makes links to the original Lord of the Ring trilogy, but overall, given what Peter Jackson was trying to accomplish, he did a wonderful job. Hobbit 3 had a lot of epic battle scenes, mixed in with a variety of moving, elegant pieces of music done by Howard Shore. It had a mixture of drama, action, adventure, romance, and magic - all of them parts that can make up a great film.If you've been following along with the Hobbit trilogy and enjoyed it, you'll find this to be a great ending to the story and well worth your money at the cinema. If you were already doubting the first two movies and didn't find them particularly enjoyable, then this may not be for you.However, as a stand-alone film, the story and the score are enough to earn it a 10/10 for me. Overall, it's a highly enjoyable movie with lots of action and adventure, and it has a memorable score.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A bloated yet entertaining farewell to Middle Earth.,"Peter Jackson takes us to Middle Earth for one last time (supposedly) in ""The Hobbit: The Battle Of The Five Armies"", the third film in the second trilogy of Middle Earth films.Peter Jackson's ""Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy are among some of the finest films ever made, his ""Hobbit"" trilogy however seems to be lacking. Back in 2012 we started off on ""An Unexpected Journey"" that led us to ""The Desolation Of Smaug"" and now finally we have arrived for ""The Battle Of The Five Armies"", the climactic event that will take us into Jackson's superior trilogy.The film kicks off all guns blazing with Smaug the stupendous reigning Dragon fire down on the people of Laketown. This opening scene is a nice introduction but it would have felt more at place at the finale of the previous installment rather than at the forefront of a film where its presence feels rushed. This fast paced action scene unfortunately makes the proceeding 30-40 minutes a rather tough ordeal to sit through. Secondary characters and tedious subplots take precedence whilst stories from the last film are tied up in the background.The film is certainly off to a rocky start, uninteresting subplots and characters distract from the otherwise entertaining and dark main plot involving our company of Dwarfs and Bilbo. Alfrid, the master of Laketown's servant from the last film is given a much bigger role in this film, which may be the worst decision Peter Jackson has ever made. The film spends far too much time focusing on this character and his relationship with Bard, attempting to be the comic relief of the film in a film that does not necessitate any.After what seems like an eternity, the film starts to pick up. Thorin and his crew scour the halls of Erebor for the Arkenstone, a most precious jewel that Thorin desperately searches for. The stone is driving him insane and he starts to suspect his own kin of thieving it from him, meanwhile Bilbo hides the stone from him. This internal conflict that Thorin has was one of the more gripping aspects of the film.Our Dwarfs prepare for battle. Our Dwarfs prepare for battle. After a lot of the drama is dealt with, the battle kicks off when the Orcs show up to claim the homeland of the Dwarfs as their stronghold. Jackson shows off his talents in the large scale conflict that eventually takes place. As entertaining as the battle is, it all gets a bit CG heavy and unfortunately begins to look like a cartoon. ""The Lord Of The Rings"" was a trilogy that pioneered the use of practical effects as well as CGI, but ""The Hobbit"" decides to throw all that away in exchange for a green screen.Azog the Defiler commands his legion of Orcs! Azog the Defiler commands his legion of Orcs! The film climaxes on a powerful note that will leave die hard fans certainly moved. When the film isn't all sword and shield, there are some more somber moments that make this the most emotional of the trilogy, most notably between Bilbo and Thorin, whose rivalry/budding friendship forgoes its roughest patch yet. After the titular battle, ends are tied up and in classic Peter Jackson fashion, multiple endings ensue, the majority of which forcibly tie in to the other trilogy.The film stumbles its way through constant tonal shifts, from romance to epic scale battles. There is an overlying stench of incoherence in this once simple tale of a band of Dwarfs taking their home back from a Dragon. There are one too many subplots and pointless characters that make this film feel even more bloated then its predecessors.""The Battle Of The Five Armies"" has its fair share of drawbacks but still has enough to entertain. As a whole ""The Battle Of The Five Armies"" is an underwhelming end to a mostly underwhelming trilogy that may have been better off as two films as originally planned.Martin Freeman, Richard Armitage and Ian McKellen deliver yet again in their respective roles as Bilbo, Thorin and Gandalf. But yet again the highlight of the film are Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly), two very good looking Elves who know their way around a fight. Character moments are exchanged for grand scale battles which depending on your preference may be a good or bad thing.The stakes of Orcs taking over Erebor don't feel big enough compared to what we've seen in this world before. In LOTR, a ring of power has to be destroyed or else evil will destroy the world and that deserved grand scale battles. ""The Hobbit"" story feels far too small to require these gigantic fights, so the smaller more intimate battles actually have a lot more impact than the CG heavy battlefield scenes.The film is a mixed bag, its off to a terrible start but slowly builds up momentum and is a serviceable send off to Jackson's visualization of Tolkien's world.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An Almost Satisfying Conclusion To An Often Unsatisfying Trilogy,"I almost gave this a miss . I fell in love with Jackson's LOTR trilogy and found myself often underwhelmed by large segments of the other Hobbit films which often took a long time to go nowhere . Even the title THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES conjures up what to expect - big overlong battles realised by some dodgy CGI . On top of that I'm not really a great cinema goer down to the fact you have to share an auditorium with other human beings and Hell can indeed be other people . None of this is helped by certain cinema chains allowing food and drink in to the showing . The first trailer was an advert for the Odeon's Croma Pizzeria where patrons can walk in a showing guzzling their ugly fat faces on pizza and I can confirm this temptation was too good for some salad dodgers to pass up . Bad enough cinemas are full of people slurping drinks and munching on crunchy popcorn but now respectful cinema fans have to endure the stench of jalapeÃ±os wafting around . We're not allowed to smoke in public places but we're allowed to annoy innocents with junk food . Sorry Odeon cinema you've just lost a patron for life . And this conclusion had better be bloody good in order to distract me from the stench and noise of the present cinema environmentSo did it ? Just about . The third part is the strongest part of the trilogy as with the previous two films less would have been much much more and you're aware of the very cynical marketing trick of making three films each lasting on average 2.5 hours when you could have had a superb film lasting three hours . One thing I did notice early on is that I'd forgotten who most of the characters were since I hadn't bothered rewatching the two previous films and if you can't remember who was who and how they fit in to the story this must be seen as a creative failure of sorts , but to be fair the plot isn't exactly taxing and it's easy to pick up what's previously happened . Perhaps even better it's easy to pick up where it's going and several scenes do overlap in to the narrative of the later LOTR trilogy . One thing the LOTR trilogy was very good at was pointing out that greed for money are ultimately self destructive and again we see the same sort of subtext which nothing else means Jackson's stream of six films are very consistentOne wishes that Jackson had kept to subtext but unfortunately he himself becomes greedy for spectacle and so has to introduce overlong battle scenes which soon outlive their welcome . To give the director some credit a few of the fight scenes do contain extras involved in intricate choreography in the fights but there's often a reliance on sweeping shots that don't entirely convince you that they're anything more than something created on computer software . Like so much of this trilogy bigger is not necessarily betterSo in summary apart from the unwanted smells and sound effects emitting from the audience I don't really feel I had wasted my time and money visiting the cinema to watch the Hobbit trilogy . This conclusion is darker in tone than its two predecessors but unlike LOTR I wasn't totally blown away and one hopes Hollywood can stop all their cynicism by making a story with two hours plot in to a franchise which unfortunately is becoming more and more common as seen in the TWILIGHT and HUNGER GAMES franchise",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Emotionally vacant.,"Finally it comes to an end. No matter how hard Peter Jackson tries to emulate the magic of Lord Of The Rings trilogy, he is going to fail miserably. The story that is already stretched out in the first two instalments hangs by a thread in this edition. The characters may be high on loyalty, love, sacrifice and honour, but none of them really manages to make this movie emotionally resonant. The only saving grace of the movie is the opening scene where Benedict Cumberbatch de spite playing a CGI dragon manages to impress in mere minutes, a feat that the entire movie couldn't in its running time. If you love your Middle Earth, or love the visual panache of Jackson that mixes his dance like choreography of huge action set pieces with some old fashioned fantasy tale about good and evil, then you are good to go. Watch and savour it. But if you seek bit more than the emotional bankruptcy that it serves, then avoid. It is elongated, dull and empty.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Unequivocally Terrible,"Peter Jackson, with this new trilogy, which adapts a somewhat long children's fairy tale into a three-part action epic, each movie being three hours long and delving into completely irrelevant stories that are only hinted at in Tolkien's body of work, has really destroyed his reputation as the Tolkien translator. He will always live in the shadow of The Lord of the Rings, which is a sumptuous, beautiful, heartrending, thrilling masterpiece.I don't know what happened. But Jackson sacrificed tone, realism, characterization, and story when he adapted The Hobbit. It is unrecognizable as work by the same director.There are so many problems with this trilogy and this movie that is nigh impossible to list them. Nearly every scene is a real travesty, and the whole operation is an affront to the source material and fans of LOTR. The movies make hyper-violent beheadings and mass slaughter into orgies of staged action sequences and dumb gags. The orcs, which are now entirely computer-generated, are no longer compelling or realistic, and they are seemingly significantly more fearsome than in LOTR... It takes what the audience understands about Middle Earth and makes it BIGGER, in a completely childish overextension of the original story, to make things even more epic! Were-worms and enormous bats - these don't exist in the larger and more climactic battle in LOTR, but sure, they existed back then, right? Sure! Jackson also turns characters into absolutely ridiculous flat caricatures. Thranduil, the bourgeois blue-blood riding an elk, Dain, Thorin's cousin, who rests his enormous high- pitched Scottish girth on a wild boar, the she- elf who falls in love with a dwarf... It's stomach churning how Peter Jackson has combined a love for extreme violence and an eye for juvenile gags and unbelievable characters, and in a beloved, classic setting.This movie, once again, extends Legolas past human bounds, past elven bounds, past the bounds of Newtonian physics, as he sprints, newly cyan eyes shining, on falling bricks and hangs from bats. We get to watch dwarfs behead seiging armies of orcs, who are impotent to the blows of the tiny Olympians. Again, oh no!, Middle Earth is doomed, the age of men is over, (cue slow-motion shots of Gandalf looking stricken, Thorin killing orcs with Sparta kicks)... The feel, the script, the look is all taken from LOTR and rehashed with this cast of cardboard characters, in a badly rendered world of excess and fancy.I expected mature film-making for thoughtful audiences expecting real characters living in a real world with a compelling story, but obviously that was too much to expect.If one of the important themes of The Hobbit is the rejection of greed, as we can see personified by Thorin, then is it hypocritical that Hollywood has churned out three abominably shallow and violent films out of The Hobbit for the public's consumption? I think so. I hate what these films represent, and what they could have done.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Best of the Three, But Average At Best","The Battle of the Five Armies marks the end of Peter Jackson's second trilogy in Middle Earth and it could not have come soon enough. This trilogy was average at best average and nothing compared to the original trilogy, Jackson seems to have lost his magic. But getting that out of the way I think Five Armies is the best from this new trilogy, it features some solid action scenes and more emotion than the previous two. Though the action went on for too long, it was still a very welcomed given the previous two films. There is something entertaining about watching a group of diverse people (elves, men, dwarfs etc) all battling it out. And of course Thorins madness and obsession with his mountain and gold was great to watch.But the movie does have quite a few faults, mainly to overuse of CGI. Too much of the scenery was fake, as well as every single character on the enemy side. There was a reason Sir Ian Mckellen broke down on set, it was because he realized he was merely talking to a green screen. Jackson completely dropped the ball here, the costume and makeup design from the first trilogy was something special and noticeable. Here, the movie comes off as too fake for its own good, even if it is top of the line CGI. As for the story aspect, the movie managed to conclude the journey on a decent note, nothing more, nothing less. Nothing to brag about, but it brought an end to character relationships and multiple story lines, some more than others (Tauriel anyone?). As for the overall experience, as I said, this was my favorite from The Hobbit Trilogy. That being said, I will most likely never watch any of these films from beginning to end, the same cannot be said about The Lord of the Rings trilogy!www.simplefilmreviews.com",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Thank you, Peter Jackson","What an epic piece of fantasy. I just made an account after reading all the hateful reviews on IMDb and watching the movie thereafter. Before we proceed: I am a big fan of Tolkien's original saga and Jackson's LotR adaptation.The Battle of the Five Armies, the last part of the Hobbit trilogy is the most epic movie I have ever seen and I don't say this lightly.People saying that Peter Jackson was arrogant enough to create his own paths of the original story to please the audience or the main stream â€“ please, give me a break. Tolkien gave us his epic universe, the dawn of the fantasy genre as we know it now.And Peter Jackson has brought this to the big screen.And therefore I am grateful, I am grateful to see this epic drama unfold and visualize in front of me on the screen, instead of my inner eye. I am grateful for every second I can dive into Tolkien's universe and Peter Jackson's vision of it.I would gladly see another trilogy, any extended editions, any amount of ""side-quests"" to see actions that remain behind the screen and that happen in between the pages of the books. But it is over and I am sad.And therefore, if you are a fan of the books and the LotR trilogy, you'll find this a fitting and worthy conclusion for an epic saga. It's action-packed, breath-takingly beautiful, dramatic, comedic and even emotional. How often did you see this description in a single movie?I say: ""Thank you, Peter Jackson, for bringing one of my favorite books to life. 10/10.""",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Not Bad for Hobbit,The worst film in the series. The role of Alfrid and Bart has been greatly exaggerated. The Alfrid looked unbearably high. The presence of Legolas was entirely used to decorate the stage. There were duel stages that were stretched over many degrees. The last movie was for your dwarf to shoot down the film to begin new dying. It was clearly the worst among the films of the Lord of the Rings.,,Anonymous,Fantasy

The Last Goodbye,"The Battle of the Armies ends Peter Jackson's six-film and almost 15-year love affair with the works of Tolkein (ends, that is, unless he starts dredging up some of the dodgier parts of ""The Silmarrilion"").Having woken Smaug, the fire-breathing dragon, deliciously voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch, the beast proceeds to fry the poor residents of the community of Laketown in a flash-bang-wallop pre-title sequence.This concludes with the Lonely Mountain, and its vast fortune in gold and treasured heirlooms, becoming a vacant property that the company of dwarfs, headed by Thorin (Richard Armitage) and Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) move into. This is no ordinary squat however, and the strategic importance of the mountain leads to hoards of elves and orcs, together with the refugees of Laketown, converging on the stronghold in an epic struggle for power. Throw into the mix a forbidden inter-racial love story between the dwarf Kili (Aiden Turner) and the elf princess Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) and the struggles of Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) against the emerging darkness of Sauron and you end up with an eventful and entertaining ending to the saga.The film is, as you would expect, a tour de force of special effects from beginning to end, although Jackson sometimes over-eggs the pudding: a slow-motion bridge collapse under a leaping Legolas (a strangely CGI'd Orlando Bloom) being a particular case in point â€“ the sequence feels like having been sponsored by the spin-off video game company! The movie is also extremely 'battle-heavy' (or ""a bit fighty"" as my wife succinctly puts it) â€“ the last two thirds of the film is pretty much an ongoing pitched battle with very little let up. If unrelenting sword-play and decapitations are not your bag, then this is probably not a film you will enjoy that much.It has to be said though that all of the performances are top notch, with Richard Armitage being particularly effective as Thorin, alternately fighting and then succumbing to the gold-induced 'Dragon-fever'. Billy Connolly also adds some much needed humour to the story in his role as a dwarf warlord, and the nation's beloved Stephen Fry entertains as the greedy and superior Master of Laketown, destined (obviously) to get his comeuppance.If this film was a one-off, I would be reviewing it as a ""Wow, that was amazing!"" film. As it is the LOTR equivalent of ""Police Academy 6â€³, my opinion is rather tarnished and whilst the film is workmanlike and entertaining, there is a feeling of 'same old, same old' about it. Another problem I found with this being a prequel to the original series is that the addition of 'new' creatures and tactics often doesn't ring true. For example, the orc armies take full advantage of some very useful giant worms and their mounted rides include enormous and very effective troll creatures. This unfortunately begs the question as to why these significant battle assets were not deployed in the ""The Return of the King"" â€“ surely they were better than those lumbering elephant things? (I realise, of course, the unreasonableness of in turns criticising a film for being samey and then criticising it for adding new stuff: hey, I'm a film critic â€“ bite me!) So, in summary, Jackson pulls the finale off with aplomb, and the final title song ""The Last Goodbye"" (sung by Billy Boyd, Pippin in the LOTR series) probably neatly expressed the sorrow felt by the director in coming to the end of his saga.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Seduced by gold,"And finally a moderately length children's book beloved to generations of kids (I read The Hobbit over 3 decades ago) comes to a conclusion on screen.When the dragon Smaug meets a sharp end in the opening ten minutes and the credits begin, I thought the story had ended. In fact it was just the beginning of a return journey which would take a further two hours and a bit.In that time Thorin gets seduced by the Gold, goes back on his word and promises. Various armies gather and there are epic battles with decapitations and Legolas becomes a super elf.Bilbo becomes a secondary character in his own story and although the battles in what is mainly CGI is entertaining the whole enterprise is rather pointless as it should had been tagged on in the last movie.Ryan Gage's scenes as the cowardly Alfrid looks misjudged, Lee Pace as Thranduil is an arrogant boreThe film does provide a bridge to the Lord of the Rings trilogy with characters such as Saruman, Galadriel, Elrond turning up and fighting which kind of reminded me of the Star Wars prequel and Christopher Lee's stunt double was in those scenes as well.Lets be plain, The Hobbit films were turned into a trilogy because they were seen as a cash cow and this cow was throughly milked.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A fitting end to an epic journey,"12 December 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester this afternoon - The Hobbit - The Battle of The Five Armies. This is the long awaited conclusion of the Hobbit Trilogy, and very welcome it was too. Epic battles, beautiful scenery, and one last chance to see the excellent Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins. Not as long as the other two this was nevertheless a fitting end to our journeys in Middle Earth. The film gathers in all the loose ends and sets you up nicely to re watch Lord of The Rings. Richard Armitage brings real passion to Thorin, a character wrestling with himself, and railing against the world. Ian McKellen has some great facial expressions which only enhance the mystique that surrounds Gandalf, and it was sad to say goodbye to the band of dwarfs we have been following for so long. Legolas was leaping around as only Legolas can and If I had to go into battle on a mountain......I'd like to be riding a goat. I only saw 2D today, this going to be awesome in 3D.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Thorin and Bilbo were the best par of this film,"I guess the book worms are still heated over the decision of making it into three films, I wish these people would quit crying and Go away, if you don't like Pete's decision don't see it. Now to the review, I will say that I enjoyed this film, the acting was superb especially with Richard Armitage, he should definitely get some kind of recognition for his performance, it reminded me of Borimir. Martin freeman was outstanding also and the others had great moments. The pacing of the film was much better The individual fight sequences were well put together. The film was almost at quality of LOTR, but it failed in some parts and it was all decision making by Peter Jackson, some characters should've not been part of the film and others should've had more screen time. The movie has it's Jar Jar Binks which I think the intention was to provide comic Relief and it failed. If your going to steer away from the book which I have no problem with, than do it right. The CGI was good in some places and in others parts not so much. I had my issues with the CGI in ROTK and I wish he would of shot it in film instead of 4k video. Overall I give this film 8 and it's because of the acting of the main characters that carry the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Really Good.,"I understand the bad reviews to an extent. Only to the extent that subplots not in the books were introduced, while other parts (in the books) were left out. But that was a fault of all three movies, so why is this film rated the worst!? I found this film to be perfect; by far the best of the three. The action was marvelously detailed, and the filmography and acting was superb. It ended very nicely, and started excitingly straight-off. I see no reason for criticism on this film other than on the page-to-screen flaws.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A reasonably satisfying conclusion to the Middle Earth saga !!!,"I personally love the original Lord of the Rings trilogy by Peter Jackson, but only as commercial blockbusters. I never viewed them as anything deep or anything which demands too much analysis. However from a technological and visual standpoint, the original trilogy was almost revolutionary. They were epic, visually exhilarating thrill rides. But I do think Jackson should have left Middle Earth after the Return of the King. There was no need to go back to that world and make prequels by breaking one book into 3 movies. I didn't like the first 2 movies of the Hobbit trilogy that much. They were mediocre summer popcorn films with too much melodrama and shiny CGI and green screen. This 3rd and last film, although not being anywhere near as good as the films in the original trilogy, is certainly better than its predecessors.This film opens with an absolutely mesmerising action set piece which is visually spectacular. From then on it has its ups and downs. The battle scenes and action scenes are very well directed, but the non-action scenes leave you extremely underwhelmed. There are attempts made by Jackson to make extremely dramatic scenes and also to continue a love triangle which started in the 2nd film, but they all look and feel cheesy and not at all convincing. So without a doubt, the fighting scenes are the ones that make this film.The acting is okay, nothing special or remarkable. To be honest, a film like this is more about the spectacular visuals and action, and less about acting skills. Most of the characters are black and white. There is no grey area. Except a few, every other character is just there to say a few lines and start fighting.This new trilogy uses a lot of CGI and green screens. One of the most important aspects why I liked the original trilogy was the fact that the orcs in the original films were real people wearing costumes. That's not the case here which negatively affects the convincing factor as far as I am concerned.So all in all, this last film of the trilogy is flawed. But I will be lying if I say I didn't have fun with it. This is a very watchable summer popcorn flick with great fight scenes, visuals and fantastic action. Just don't expect anything more in terms of character depth and narrative layers, and you will find yourself satisfied.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An effects spectacle,"I decided from the very start to take this film for what it was gonna be and that was a finale with the most epic of battles. As far as story and characters go, the movie does resonate with me on a couple of things. First and foremost, Thorin's transition from a man obsessed with power to a fighting warrior that is willing to die for his brothers is one of the good things this movie brings. Bilbo is also another character that gets good closure, and let's be honest, it would be a travesty if he didn't since he is in the movie's title. Regardless of how you felt about their objective, the battle scenes were terrificly shot and added to the overall scope of the film.Still not all is well with this final chapter in the saga, such as the misguided way to highlight all stories in the movie. It straight up continues on from the end of DOS, as it takes care of that in the first 20 minutes, making it only the official end of the previous movie. With Desolation Of Smaug we still had a meet up between Gandalf and Thorin prior to the mission, something I felt was a good way to start an individual chapter. Once again, criticism of how the book was divided is reasonable. I think with some good editing, these three movies could have easily become one 3-hour single film with each of the three movies made taking one hour. Instead we got what we got and it ended up only having some good moments when compared to the ultimate journey that was The Lord Of The Rings.So to close this review, I say that The Hobbit trilogy had its ups and downs. I found the first one nothing more than a set-up with some dullness behind it. The second one upped the ante and is my favorite of the trilogy and the last one tried its best to wrap up everything in a pleasing fashion. Having come after the LOTR movies, the comparison was always gonna be unfair and given that a trilogy was drawn out of one book, the adaptation was always going to be difficult. Despite this, I appreciated the efforts and actually found the last 2 movies to be quite entertaining if slightly muddled in their overall cuts.Rating: 7,5-8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Like an extended video game cutscene,"After the first two Hobbit movies, you know what to expect. It's no deep and mystical journey to another world, but an extended video game cutscene that consists of endless mindless battle scenes. The severely cheesy introduction where the plucky Bard uses his son as a bow to kill Smaug sets the scene for the rest of the film. Why not enjoy it for what it is? Sure, it's an inconsistent CGI mess - the orc leaders are invincible to the point of absurdity, the enemies go are rarely in any real danger, the protagonists are indestructible (for when they're not), and the physics are ludicrous. But it's great fun, as long as you keep your expectations in check! It lives up to its title. It's a battle of five armies - and not much else.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Little Besides the Battle Scenes,"""The Battle of the Five Armies"" presumably marks the final instalment in Peter Jackson's adaptation of Tolkien's work. (Unless, of course, he is thinking of having a crack at ""The Silmarillion""). The battle was dealt with in a single chapter of ""The Hobbit""; its expansion into an epic feature film lasting well over two hours is symptomatic of the way in which this relatively short novel has been inflated into something far more grandiose in Jackson's hands.The seemingly invincible dragon Smaug is killed early on by the courageous archer Bard while attacking the city of Laketown. This leaves the Dwarfs and their leader Thorin Oakenshield in possession of the dragon's treasure which they claim is theirs by right. Unfortunately, other parties also have claims to the treasure, and two Dwarf armies, one led by Thorin, the other by his Glaswegian cousin Dain, prepare to do battle with armies of Men, Elves and Orcs. (I know Glasgow is not actually in Middle Earth, but Billy Connolly plays Dain as though he were a denizen of the Gorbals).Another strand in the plot deals with the development of Thorin's character. When we first see him in this film, he is suffering from what Gandalf calls ""dragon sickness"", that is to say that he has been corrupted by the dragon's wealth. He is so selfish, greedy and arrogant that he is prepared to fight the Elves and Men, who should be his natural allies, for possession of it; only later does he come back to his senses and make common cause with them against the Orcs.In terms of spectacle and excitement, the battle scenes can compare with anything in Jackson's earlier ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Unfortunately, the film contains little else except battle scenes. The plot has many twists and turns, but these mostly involve the arrival of yet another army on the battlefield, the shifting alliances between the various factions or a reversal of fortune suffered by one side or another on the battlefield. Some of the actors are good, notably Martin Freeman as the resourceful Bilbo, Richard Armitage as the tormented Thorin Ian McKellen as Gandalf, but they tend to be overshadowed by the grand spectacle being played out behind them. ""The Battle of the Five Armies"" did nothing to overturn my view that it was a mistake to try and film ""The Hobbit"" in the same style as ""The Lord of the Rings"". 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The worst in trilogy and among all Jackson's Middle-earth films,"To make three movies from one 200 page book was initially a mistake (not in box office respect of course). If the first Hobbit was more or less pleasant return to Middle-earth, although it was obviously worse than each LOTR movie, second and third films are total disappointments, though they are not completely bad.The Battle of the Five Armies is the quintessence of how writers and director couldn't create an interesting storylines as good as Tolkien's ones. Degradation of original and some cliches of the movie's individual characters are more evident in this last film. Some inconsistencies with LOTR films are conspicuous as well. But the most obvious flaw is making a dull, long and boring battle with unrealistic CGI a central moment of the entire movie. It's not what I and other people expected from the creators of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Some scenes are just too long, others are stupid. The only reason why I didn't give this film a lower rating is because a like this universe and because film is more or less watchable and has some good moments.You can watch The Battle of the Five Armies, especially if you've already seen two previous movies, but be ready for a kind of disappointment and don't expect something unsurpassed or as good as the Return of the King.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pacing was a key thing I liked about this film,"The saga has come full circle, and my worst fears of a stumbling ending has been alleviated. What I found striking is the film's striking pacing which is strangely very true to the book (note, pacing). I was never truly bored, and Hobbit/Lord of the Rings have a tendency to drag on. Sure there are some of these annoying ""this sets up for LOTR"", but it's more to find a way to conclude characters in the film.Overall it was an ""expected"" experience, but I wasn't raging out of the cinema. The trilogy is definitely a warmer welcome than the Episode 1-3 of Star Wars, and I can see myself watch all 6 films of what I presume now is called ""The Middle-Earth Saga"" back-to-back.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Perfect,"I doubt there are many people out there that have read Tolkien's books more then I have. The Hobbit is perhaps the book that I appreciated the most, through too it's more fairy tale-like style. I have have always considered the movies and the books to be completely separated work of arts, the movies were made inspired by the books and not as a way to adapt the complete story into visual form. Every time I either watch the LOTR or The Hobbit I travel back into this fantastic world of fantasy which I use to visit as a teenager. In my opinion The Hobbit and LOTR have no real competitor in genre of fantasy movies, just like the books always will stand alone at the very top, this I say after over 2000 rated movies and over 500 fantasy books in my bookshelf. Peter Jackson have done it again, a perfect fantasy movie which allow the audience to feel like a part of Middle-earth, an escape from reality that lasts about 2h 30m, completely satisfying, and thats what both fantasy books and movie is all about.Now I wish that they decide to make movies out of Nick Perumov's continuation trilogy about Middle-earth. The books are not as good the original made by Tolkien but they would inspire to three new and even darker visits to the land of Tolkien. For all Tokien fans who haven't read the book I highly recommend to do, they are called The Ring of Darkness (MÃ¶rkrets ring in Swedish)",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Notch Above Its Predecessor,"This movie picks up at the exact same spot that its predecessor (""The Hobbit-The Desolation of Smaug"") left off with the dragon known as Smaug in the process of destroying Laketown. Likewise as a prequel to ""The Lord of the Rings-The Fellowship of the Ring"" it ends at the same spot where the later film begins. In other words this movie fits right in and ties ""The Hobbit"" trilogy in with the three ""Lord of the Rings"" films quite nicely. That said, I would strongly recommend that a person new to these movies begin with ""The Hobbit-An Unexpected Journey"" and then continue on through ""The Hobbit"" series before beginning on ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies if at all possible to gain a better understanding and appreciation for this particular film. Of course if a person has read all of the books in the ""Tolkien series"" then perhaps that might not be necessary. However that's just my opinion and I suppose a person can perhaps still enjoy this movie without any previous knowledge. In any case, I found this movie to be a notch above its predecessor and I believe that fans of this genre will certainly like this movie as much as they did all of the others. Accordingly, I rate this film as above average.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Over battling makes the plot hollow,"This film continues the story of Bilbo Baggins and his adventure, after the fierce dragon Smaug is awakened.As the final chapter of ""The Hobbit"", I was looking forward to a grand finale that moves mountains. Indeed, there is much action, in fact the whole film is battle after battle. There is very little plot, just lots of killing. The constant over simulation overwhelmed my senses and numbed my responses, preventing me from feeling the poignant ending. In addition, the constant fighting means there's little time to develop an actual plot, making the film rather hollow. I have to say, despite the amazing graphics, I was a bit disappointed by the film.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
That's what happens when you expand a single book into three movies,"Well, I have to say that I'm glad that's over. The final movie was well worth the price of admission, which in my case was a free ticket to a preview screening.I found this movie to be a stretch and as the final movie in a trilogy that was getting less interesting the further you went into the series, I left feeling extremely disappointed, and glad I didn't pay for the premium experience (3D, Imax, etc).There was a little too much CG this time around, and it wasn't even all that great. Case in point two close scenes with a rider approaching and leaving were clearly CG...they couldn't even afford to use a real horse and rider? Come on...The battle scenes went on way too long and in parts were even more ridiculous than the ""riding the broken wooden bridges all the way down to the bottom of the cavern..."" scene in the earlier edition of this series, and since the battle scenes were pretty much all that carried this movie, well...Yes, this movie does have to be seen and it should be viewed on a big screen. However, in the opinion of this reviewer, waiting until it appears in a second run theatre will provide better value for money.It's a movie that wraps up a series, but when compared to Peter Jackson's original LOTR work it pales and is as pale as an orc who has been working in the basement of Orthanc.

I'm not sure why this one takes the most flak.,"I think this film goes a long way to explain why Jackson and company decided to split the novel into (at least) 2 films. The material after Smaug's death is grim, especially compared to the rest of it. And given the 3 key character deaths it makes sense that you would want to isolate this section and flesh it out. This is especially true if you are an action filmmaker. Character deaths should have dramatic meaning beyond whatever linguistic obsession Tolkien had. A character we have come to know going mad needs time to breath.In some ways this is most complete Middle Earth film Jackson ever made. It stands on its own far more than the other 5 films in the series. It feels like an episode unto itself. I rather like as a experience because it is one of few times I have ever been able to follow a battle tactically in cinema with ease. It works as a story of a battle.So yes like the rest of the Hobbit films this is too long-awkwardly trying to split the difference between the novel and the LOTR films. It is filled with redundancies and bizarre additions, i.e. Alfred But I think it has a lot of great moments-the chariot sequence is really great.It never captures the charm of the first hour or so of film 1 but it avoids the bottom of the barrel that is the climax of film 2.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Piece of Climax,"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is the final part of Peter Jackson's trilogy split adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's book. Compared to the last two, this installment consists more action, trying to give the explosive payoff that many of the fans were waiting for, for like two years. And as an action blockbuster, The Battle of the Five Armies does succeed, but it still feels like a fragment. A part of the story that shouldn't be treated as a singular experience, that the story and character development from the past films should be fresh in the mind to be compelled with this particular experience. The movie itself is pretty dazzling on its own, but that is probably just it. This is just one epic climax extended into a two hour or so feature film.Just like The Desolation of Smaug, this installment feels really dependent on the other films for the viewers to appreciate the feature as a whole. The first Hobbit movie already has a standalone arc to leave the audience satisfied, but the following two are really reliant to each other that only seeing one of them at the same day won't really be enough of an experience, in spite of already having the largest spectacles of the franchise. The Battle of the Five Armies offers more epic warfare than anything else: the tone is darker, there's a lot of impressive set pieces and remarkable (and even emotional) thrills here and there. There is also some character moments that needed to be challenged, but they are only scattered around and resolved a little too easily. Still, the real conflict here is the war and the film does a great job for that, but it also gets exhausting until it becomes dramatic near the end of the fights.The amount of battles is probably ultimate, but you could point out some memorable bits. This is not one of those blockbusters that just throw away some random CGI flare, though it's sometimes getting there, but director Peter Jackson still chooses to be creative at many turns of the warfare. Even though there's too much special effects on screen, it still doesn't let it be just a grandeur design, there is tension containing in those digital images. While the majority of the film is all fighting, the cast still manages to shine in their characters. With Martin Freeman sticking to the same charm and earnestness his performance has always been as Bilbo Baggins. The rest of them, while more serious, does compellingly in their important moments of the movie.The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is fun, once you get used to it, but it really feels like just a missing ending of the last one, been found for a whole year. There is a reason why this should have been a single movie or at least a double split. Stretching an entire climax for nearly two hours is probably too much of an experience. Even with the filmmakers handling each action scene well, it still doesn't make for a good replacement of a better narrative. What the fans should be thankful is it didn't become some The Matrix Revolutions fiasco or a lazy special effects show that distracts the viewers out of nothing. The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is still a good conclusion of the saga, leaving us its last good thrills and emotions.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Flawed but great.,"I have to say I have reservations about this film, largely to do with casting but overall I thought it was terrific. I think the casting of James Nesbitt and Billy Connolly in particular just took a lot away for me - Connolly is so much himself it brought one back to reality instead of being steeped in the world of MiddleEarth. Luke Evans was great as Bard and I could see him cast as Thorin too. Richard Arming had a difficult task to be a hero and villain at the same time. I loved the battle scenes, inventive as ever and in spite of taking up most of the film I never grew tired of seeing it. Lots of people have been irritated by Legolas' seeming disregard for physics but if you remember the LOTR films he displays an uncanny knack for seemingly impossible physical feats. If you study the elves army's movement you will find that fascinatingly odd too - they are elves for Chrissakes! Peter Jackson has given a suite of films based on Tolkien's work which I do not believe anyone else could have done. I applaud him.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

lots of Orc-kills Rambo style,"Smaug is loose and reigns his fire upon Lake-Town. Bard manages to kill the dragon with the Black Arrow. Thorin Oakenshield and the dwarfs reclaim the mountain and its treasures but the gold has driven Oakenshield mad. He is obsessed with finding the Arkenstone but Bilbo has already taken it. The elfs and the villagers descend on the mountain to claim their fair share but Thorin is mad with greed. All the while, the Orcs are secretly closing in on the argumentative bunch.Over the years, I've come to the conclusion that these movie series need 'Previously On' segments. In this movie, the plot is pretty simple and recounting it is not an absolute necessity although a refresher would be helpful. What is truly needed is a section to rebuild the dramatic tension. The story just plop down right into a battle. It's an abrupt start and not in a good way. I also dislike the silly villainy of Alfrid Lickspittle. It's not particularly funny and rather insipid. Also the Orcs are nothing more than cannon fodder. It doesn't feel scary when they are mowed down Rambo style. Nevertheless, this is a fun adventurous ride. Tauriel continues to be a good addition providing the only feminine touch and some needed heart. Almost everybody has their fair shake.

The acting is top notch as well; Martin Freeman (Bilbo Baggins) is a fantastic hobbit, and Richard Armitage (Thorin Oakenshield) does an awesome job as a conflicted dwarf lord, portraying his character's good and evil sides extremely well.I feel the story had a couple of loose ends, but nothing too intricate that you cannot puzzle out yourself.In the end, it was a fun experience.

Superb - Warning - Spoiler Alert,"Having seen and enjoyed the three Lord of the Rings films, I was,keen to see this trilogy but somewhat dubious of it being a credible adaptation of the book in question; and that has to be remembered, it as based on the book and does not claim to be an exact copy. Despite my initial doubts,it was shaping up to be an enjoyable trilogy Myself and my 12 year old son had watched the first two parts, and for us,this topped them both.The beginning, with the death of a certain Dragon, catapults you into the film headfirst, and works beautifully.The battle scenes are all they should be - and more - and Thorins battle with himself is handled well.There are odd moments of levity, some real sadness and the film never feels overlong.

A Thundering Conclusion of an Overall Disappointing Trilogy.,"Peter Jackson's self-aggrandizing attempt to bloat a simple children's story to an epic fantasy tale in three parts culminates in an overlong battle scene only to puff out in mediocrity and stereotypes.If the director chose to stay truth to the source material and left out all this fillers, he could have made an unique movie that consists only of two parts at the utmost and more importantly stands on its own instead of having this ""spin-off""-character of LOTR: why trying to copy and even surpass a legendary trilogy that was designed as such from the very beginning by inventing a kind of ""prequel"" based on a thin bedtime story that doesn't come even close to LOTR in every respect? Is Peter Jackson paying homage to Tolkien or just to himself as the master of battle choreography?""The Hobbit"" was written first, so it's per definition not a prequel, it just happens to play before the events of LOTR, all this references in the movie are simply redundant and serve no other purpose than to satisfy a vain fan nostalgia, it has nothing to do with any real artistic ambitions. it's the pure exploitation of a franchise that comes along with the latest CGI technology. ""The Battle of Five Armies"" is worth seeing from a technical point of view since the visuals are topnotch, the little, poor rest of the plot that wasn't managed to be finished in the previous parts is somehow pressed in between the fights.Let's face it, LOTR is far better.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
a more enjoyable trilogy,"for what it's worth, i like the hobbit trilogy better than the fellowship trilogy. first, i love martin freeman. i love the simplicity of the characters. it doesn't have the bloat, in my opinion, that the fellowship trilogy suffered. there are expansions on the original theme, including of course the obligatory love story, but in this case i felt like Taurien actually added something to the story, which due to the times and culture in which it was written is a little overwhelmingly patriarchal. there were significant other sub-plots to the fellowship trilogy (film version) that to me added nothing to the original plot-line and simply functioned to enable a three-parter rather than a simple sequel. i did not enjoy jackson's depiction of frodo and his weepy comrade Samwise, who i think could have been far better enacted from a directorial interpretation standpoint. the hobbit is cleaner, and simply more appealing. i still enjoy the fellowship trilogy, although i am not so fond of two towers. i thought this trilogy held the pace of action and plot development much better. maybe part 1 of the fellowship trilogy was more engaging than part 1 of the hobbit trilogy, but as a whole i enjoyed the storyline of the hobbit much better, even with the egregious addition of Legolas and the woefully underused talent of Cate Blanchett, who deserves a trilogy of her own!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
".....""It feels thin, sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread..!!""","This trilogy as a whole does not even reach half the level of the LOTR one. Again, Hollywood's greed took over and gave us an unnecessary three films out of one book. And the result is a long series of 'joyride' scenes, a couple of fights, and some isolated conversation scenes to form an incoherent trilogy that will not stand the test of time very well.This last Hobbit chapter is filled with characters that you won't feel anything towards by the end. A love story that never was written by Tolkien. And a movie title war that doesn't feel half as intense as Helms Deep. Funnily enough. Aside from Bilbo. Alfred, who is the most pointless character in the film, was the most realized.To me. This is not a movie trilogy. It's more of a game trilogy with Peter hogging the joystick to himself! You feel excited watching people play the first level. Get bored by the second. Then fell asleep by the third level. And in this trilogy, we the audience are mere watchers. We don't feel like we're apart of this joyride like we did in LOTR. In a sense, I see this trilogy as a slightly higher quality Transformers movie. You're watching for the adrenaline roller coaster, nothing else.Two films would have sufficed Mr. Jackson. But I guess Bilbo(PJ) was corrupted by the ring after all. And greed has indeed reached the Shire(NZ).",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very good but not LOTR The Return of the King,"The third part of the Hobbit (The Battle of the Five Armies) it just takes a few pages of the Hobbit book. When you consider that the full book is about 150 pages and you can read it in 3 or four hours; it is difficult to understand how can Jackson made 7.5 hours trilogy (about 9 on the extended cut). Well basically adding characters and secondary events to the main story. Was that good ? It was not bad; but a little less could have been better.As a book; The Hobbit is really a kids tale. There is no much character development; the message is quite simple and the end is somewhat sad. There is some mention of the ring but it is not a prequel to Lord of the Ring (or at least it was not originally conceived that way).The in itself covers three situations/action settings; the attach and killing Smaug; the battle of the five armies and the end which is basically a farewell.I was surprised the first set was so contained. It is spectacular but not that impressive.The second set; the battle is more spectacular but still not impressive; until the end; Two man to man (or man to Orc and Elf to Orc) fights (not part of the book) are far more suspenseful and touching than the rest of the movie.I believe Jackson got tired (or out of ideas) on those massive battles. He kept them for the public; but he was far more interested in the love triangle between Dwarf, Elf and Elf.In brief; it is not boring at all and worth the price of the ticket; besides these two sagas took too many years to be made right.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
End of a film era.,"the original lord of the rings trilogy are my favourite films of all time. I loved all three and when the Hobbits first came out my expectations were a lot higher so perhaps I did not enjoy the last three instalments as much but they are still brilliant and well made films. There is no one else on the planet that could have made these six films I all as good as Peter Jackson has made them. If people did not like this film or the other hobbits then that is fine but lets be thank full that they have been made and to as good of standard of film cinematography as possible. The battle scenes in all of the films and particularly this one are second to none they are amazingly created. It must be very difficult to actually produce the high action quality that is shown and I could watch it all day. Sometimes it does become a bit too much but this isn't something I would say is such a bad thing. I love the action in this film. The acting is very good, couldn't name someone who could play Bilbo as well as Martin Freeman has done and the same goes for Gandalf with Ian McKellen there are a lot of good acting with this film. I also really liked the ending where it ends where the lord of the rings takes off.However there was some flaws within the story and felt that with some parts left unexplained. The unexplained parts could be within the books which then is something I would have to explore and probably will do. I think with the huge battle scenes some things get left to just be accepted. What I would say is that I do find it a bit annoying that not just for this film *spoilers* that the eagles have to save the day, again and again. If this is sticking to the books then that is okay but this is one thing I don't really like or understand fully. With all the elves, dwarfs, men, wizards, spirits that the only way of stopping the enemy is through eagles swooping in to win the battle. If they was explained more or given a section of the film or a previous film to say why they turn up and help all the time it would be great. This one little thing does have a little annoyance to me.Furthermore I absolutely loved all the lord of the rings and hobbit movies, I am so gutted that there will be no more of them. It is like an end of an era in film for me as I grew up watching these films and loved every moment of them. I am going to buy this film when it comes out along with the rest of the hobbits to have all of them. would recommend this film to anyone but would have to of had a love for the lord of the rings or the previous hobbits to fully enjoy and understand the true brilliance of this franchise. Lastly which perhaps wont get as much credit as it deserves is the song at the end of the film through the credits performed by Billy Boyd, I loved this song and had to listen to it again and again, Brilliant.8/10 but a 10/10 for the whole trilogy.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Absolutely amazing and perfect ending for the Series,"From the first movie onwards, I am a big Hobbit fan.I have been waiting for this movie desperately and I was not disappointed. What a movie, that was!! There couldn't be any better end of this. Direction was perfect and view and display of scenery and war, absolutely marvelous. The grandeur of the scenes is inexplicable. It was action full movie and very good except one part, where Legolas almost flew climbing the stairs, that became dramatic. Thranduil was very good and justified the role. There were some heartbreaking scenes because I was expecting happy moments. As a last say, I am sad that there won't be any upcoming hobbit movie and happy that I saw such a good movie!! clearly best movie of the year for me..",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Its a Masterpiece, Different from the LOTRs.","Well this trilogy was intended to be different from the LOTR series. They had to improvise and include many content (From Tolkien's world) to make this epic trilogy, The Last installment had it all coming the first half build up the story right from where it was left in the last one. The Politics, Ego , Character Development can be seen vividly. The Second half is all Boom-Boom EPIC Battles. The Special Effects team has not left a single stone unturned and as usual every minute detail is taken into account.The movie deserves all the credit for the hard-work and dedication, It provides good entertainment along with some take home lessons.All in all its a brilliant finish to a brilliant saga.

What a way to end the series!!!!!!!!!,"This movie is a masterpiece!!! So very well done! I cannot understand how anyone could give this a bad review. The acting is fantastic, the visuals are absolutely incredible, the action is awesome, and Peter Jackson did an amazing job directing it!!!!! I was engaged in the movie from start to finish. It also has a little bit of everything in it. Comedy, romance, a boatload of action, drama. Its got something for everyone. If you liked the other two hobbit movies, you will love this one! Don't listen to the haters, or the people who don't like it because it strays from the book. In my opinion Peter Jacksons hobbit trilogy is an improvement of the book. Don't get me wrong I loved the book, but these movies add so much more to the story in a positive way. It's sad to see the middle-earth series come to an end, but this movie does the series justice! I would highly recommend this movie to anyone! Its one of those movies that will never get old!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Will you follow Jackson one last time into Middle Earth?,"""Will you follow me, one last time?""Not only is Thorin asking his dwarfs to follow him one last time into battle, but Peter Jackson is also asking us to join him one last time in experiencing his vision of Middle Earth. We all know The Hobbit was one short book (about 300 pages), but Jackson decided to adapt it into three full length movies so there is going to be a lot of characters and elements included that aren't in the book. J.R.R Tolkien fans might be upset and most audiences agree that Jackson made a mistake in stretching the material because this trilogy hasn't had the same emotional impact as the Lord of the Rings trilogy had. However, Jackson is still asking us to accompany him one last time into Middle Earth in order to tie everything together. He and the producers may have experienced their share of dragon fever by getting greedy and wanting to bank on the success of their first trilogy (it is kind of ironic when you take into account that the underlying message of the novels is that greed destroys the soul), but they are asking us to join them for one last time, and they deserve it. If you are a fan of the franchise this will be an emotional moment for you, but if you don't care much for this world then you will find the film annoying. It does tie in the first two films of The Hobbit trilogy very well with The Lord of the Rings so it serves as a sort of closure for these epic films. At 144 minutes, this is the shortest film of the franchise and you sort of get the feeling that Jackson doesn't know how to sum things up in less than 3 hours because this film feels rushed and overstuffed with characters and subplots. It also happens to be action packed with a battle scene lasting for almost an hour. It may be a bit too much, but there is no denying that Peter Jackson cares deeply for the material here and is devoted to it. Despite not being nearly as engaging as The Lord of the Ring trilogy, The Hobbit has its emotional moments with strong action sequences and some solid performances. Jackson is asking us to follow him for the last time, but it is up to us to decide if his passion and dedication is worth the journey. I joined him and was mildly entertained although I found several flaws. Despite not being as entertaining as The Desolation of Smaug, this is still an improvement over The Unexpected Journey.The Battle of the Five Armies picks up right where The Desolation of Smaug left us, giving me the feeling that I had paused the film and waited a whole year before hitting the play button once again. It took me a while to recall everything that had been going on, but with the opening action sequence I had to rush those memories in order to understand everything that was going on. The Hobbit is actually one film divided into three parts which makes it difficult to analyze apart from each other. There is a sense of cohesion among these films and we finally get the concluding chapter after an agonizing and extended fist part which felt completely stretched out and an entertaining second chapter where we were introduced to new and familiar characters and an impressive dragon voiced by the great Benedict Cumberbatch. This third chapter picks up with that very dragon destroying the nearby village where Bard (Luke Evans) and his children are. The film begins with an impressive action sequence and then the next hour is dedicated to build up what will be the ultimate battle scene with five different armies preparing for battle. This is where the movie begins to feel convoluted and overstuffed with subplots that feel too rushed. But at times the film does succeed when it centers on the relationship between Bilbo (Martin Freeman) and Thorin (Richard Armitage). We know that Jackson knows how to deliver spectacular visuals and action sequences, but what was missing from The Lord of the Rings trilogy was that character development we finally got to see here with these two characters. Unfortunately there are other elements included that don't work too well (like the love triangle between Kili, Legolas, and Tauriel that feels misplaced). The build up and the action scenes might be a bit too much for audiences, and ultimately the film fails to stand out from other epics. It is an average film that has its ups and downs, but still manages to bring closure. Unfortunately this trilogy never lives up to the grandeur of The Lord of the Rings.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Decent but in no way a classic,"The Middle-earth saga is concluded with arguably the worst part in the Hobbit series and thus the worst movie out of the six in Peter Jackson's Tolkien universe.We know the characters, we know the setting but what we experience is nothing short of just milking the series with one extra movie.To be fair, this finale lacks the character development and attachment we normally feel when watching these movies. Also, the plot is seemingly non-existent. The creators rely way too much on the war scenes, super clichÃ© fighting and some actually bad acting from the people of Dale.I'm a huge fan of the previous 5 movies and am sure the extended version of this movie will be quite something else than the cinema version. The final chapter deserves more.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Tolkien will haunt Peter Jackson,"If you haven't read The Hobbit and/or if you like the first two movies: I envy you of sorts...If someone had told me some years ago that I would consider walking out from a Tolkien movie opening night, I would have slapped them with a cod. Or a salmon. The Hobbit trilogy is crap.It's little more than a long list of invented battles and love stories to attract a widest possible audience, as well as loads of idiotic storyline to make the story slide into the Lord of the Rings movies as smooth as an Elven ass.I understand that some adaption is required from book to screen, but when dealing with a book more or less only surpassed by the Bible and the IKEA catalogue, one should tread carefully.Do yourself a favor. Read the book. Let your mind be the big screen.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It all Ends (starts) here,"After rescuing Erebor from Smaug, it's now up to Thorin and Company to defend it, come what may.Where the battle was lost: 1. Bilbo throwing stones at Orcs and stopping them. 2. Thorin Oakenshield becomes Middle Earth's second psychiatric patient (first being his grandfather). 3.The end which never ends. Jack Nicholson quoted after the LOTR trilogy,""What happened at the end?"" referring to the lengthy end. There's something similar here but not as long as the former. 4. Despite being a battle it was uncomfortable looking at the bleeding face of Tauriel who went left and right through the same set of Orcs a few days ago (as per the movie). 5. Lack of a scenic change (battle ground throughout)is another low note in this finale. 6. I am not in for spoilers. So,here's the thing. It's a pity that something like this should happen to someone so big, so soon (Go figure).Where the battle was won: 1. CGI stands apart, be it when Smaug ravages Dale, or when elves gather outside Erebor in their shining golden armor, or when Galadriel and co fight shadow monsters it's CGI that makes the 3D glasses worth its while. 2. Unlike its predecessors this one goes easy on the viewers with a runtime of just 131 minutes(excluding the credits). 3. Legolas' duel stands apart for its choreography while Thorin's physical balance act with Azoc is another memorable moment. 4. Most impressive of all is how the Hobbit was placed in the middle of all this mess. He is, after all that he has been through, still a hobbit and not a hero. Peter Jackson could have just given him a blade (not the letter opener that he already has) and made him fight orcs. But rather the Hobbit is moving between camps, using the ring to the fullest and playing a vital part in the battle without actually fighting and thus justifying the title.Having presented the pros and cons of the battle, I leave it to your better judgment to decide whether or not this battle is worth fighting (watching).PS: People die, People with a capital P (duh it's a battle, what do you expect?).",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great fun!,"Thoroughly enjoyed this movie - somewhat lacking in areas, where some characters appear, then vanish without trace, but then again I expect that to be attended to by the time of this film's 'extended edition' release.Very well paced, trouble is it's over in a heartbeat. Still epic, regards movie length, however it soon comes to a close, on account of it not once being boring, I guess, and my not wanting it to end.The battle itself is long, however has many different areas of focus, for audience attention, condensing considerably towards the end, concerning main character involvement, and such.I'm delighted Jackson gave us 3 movies, and I'm quite happy to see extra details, as taken from the Lord of the Rings appendixes, in addition to newly written material.This film may be nothing more than a waste of money and time, in the eyes of certain Hobbit, LOTR's purists, however MY heart sits firmly in place with the movies, above and beyond the books which, in my honest opinion, are very difficult to read. Not that I CAN'T read them, just that I don't like Tolkein's of style writing. The Hobbit was always an easy read, but as for the rest - oh just give me the movies!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wonderful...,"My only distress is that it has ended. A story of epic proportions. Enjoyed it thoroughly.Stellar cast.IN-CREDIBLE action!Beautiful score.It's always been hard for me to determine which installment was my favorite because Jackson pieced these films together just like reading a novel. The consistency in storytelling, imagery, music, casting, graphics, choreography has produced a fluid and intricately tailored series. It was everything that I expected without having any idea what I was going to see. The opener alone was flipping fantastic!

nice film..................!!!!!!,"""Will you follow me... one last time?"" The beginning of the end. Warner Bros has debuted the first teaser trailer for Peter Jackson's The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, the grand finale in his Middle Earth series, and it looks to be a very nostalgic and exciting ending. Martin Freeman returns as Bilbo, Luke Evans as Bard, Richard Armitage as Thorin, Ian McKellen as Gandalf, and everyone else they have in the illustrious cast. As this is the first teaser, it doesn't reveal too much footage, but does hint at how epic the ""Battle of the Five Armies"" will be and how he's trying to match the tone of Lord of the Rings, so it can lead right into Fellowship. I'm really looking forward to seeing this sure-to-be spectacular Hobbit finale.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies,"Bilbo and Company are forced to engage in a war against an array of combatants and keep the terrifying Smaug from acquiring a kingdom of treasure and obliterating all of Middle-Earth.After fifteen years, five films and countless hours of on screen magic depending on whether you were hardcore enough to sit through the extended editions and features of each films; Peter Jackson brings this journey to a close and to what now ranks as one of the most monumental work ever completed by a single filmmaker. It's also arguably his biggest challenge. Without wasting time on any kind of flashback or prologue, the film plunges right in where The Desolation of Smaug left off; It's like beginning The Empire Strike Back with Luke Skywalker blowing up the Death Star. Here opening with Smaug swooping down in a blaze of vengeance, while the panicked Lake Town locals disperse. It's an exciting sequence animated by a real sense of danger and by the nightmare figure of Smaug himself: one of the movie's most special effect, again voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch. Plus, we are launched into nearly an hour or arguing and reflecting as various armies get ready for war. This is an effective crescendo to battle and when the things do finally kick off, the fight worth the wait. The battle is endlessly inventive. From all corner of the land, and the frame, they come: dwarfs, elves, men, assorted forest creatures and orcs; all displaying numerous ingenious tactics to sustain pretty much every verse. In fact, Peter Jackson is able to give an intimacy to even the biggest, noisiest battle scenes. This final instalment of The Hobbit trilogy ties very well onto the last two films but also with the beginning of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It does feel like The Return of the King at times, when bodies are just flying everywhere and heads rolling all over the place. It is long and epic. The Battle of the Five Armies is the strongest, boldest film in this trilogy and provides just the send off that this series deserves. Peter Jackson knows when to punctuate the carnage with a gag or a tender moment as it's not focusing on the action and the battle itself. This film is rewarding all the characters built up over two and a bit movies, all f them flawed. With Martin Freeman ever-excellent Bilbo more of a player this time. Indeed some conversation between Bilbo and Thorin create the most interesting moment of the movie, as Bilbo has the Arkenstone and Thorin really wants it. It's starting to drive him mad, almost like Gollum towards the ring. This film feels psychologically weightier than the previous one, largely a credit to Richard Armitage who plays Thorin with the paranoid despotic rage of a Shakespearean King. Yet he never allows him to become a monster. Gandalf: Sir Ian McKellen, of course everybody knows he is awesome and knocks out the part. The Stage is set for other characters to stand out, such as Luke Evans, as Bard, a genuine leader and maybe the most human character ever in Middle-Earth; while Kili (starring Aidan Turner) and Tauriel's (Evangeline Lilly) romance is undeniably touching. At the end all of the key players are where they need to be. Wrapping things up with a suitably return to the Shire that effectively brings the saga full circle. It's hard not to marvel at Peter Jackson's facility with these characters and this world, which he seems to know as well as John Ford knew his Monument Valley. It's easier to see now that it stops the entire Hobbit project as a labour of love on Jackson's part, rather than a descent into the box-office opportunism. This film is a fitting cap to an extended series that, if nothing else, has transformed Tolkien's place in the wider culture. His books were once strictly for teen nerds (we've all been there), while The Battle of the Five Armies is just as enjoyable as each of the five movies that came before it. I'm part of these nerds and I've always been a huge fan of Tolkien's work. Much of the movie is not like the book at all but I was aware of if that going in: there are a tone of added characters. Purists have to deal with it I guess! The most important point is that Peter Jackson captured perfectly the tone of the source material he has adapted. If a filmmaker is able to capture the feels and tone of the source material then he has succeeded and Jackson's vision of Middle-Earth is as good as we'll ever see.Find the end HERE http://offscreenreviews.blogspot.fr/",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Well Deserved Culmination !!!,"Not everything in this world gets what it deserves... but this trilogy, which hooked me with its first installment in 2012, gets the EXACT culmination which it deserved; Grand and Fulfilling.The first two.episodes in this enchanting adventure of our little friends had very nicely built up the platform for an epic battle and my Word... is the battle EPIC or what. Right from the word go... it grasps your breath and doesn't let u breath or blink even for single moment... such is the pace of this ultimately gripping Finale of this Adventure of a lifetime... frame after frame...scene after scene... the intensity of the experience grows and not a single dull moment to break the trance of this magical journey.And when the feverish pace of a multi-layered war finally leaves you breathless... thats when the soothing and serene penultimate portions give a velvety escort towards a highly satisfactory climax of all the anticipation and excitement that was built very intelligently over the last three years.Any glitches?? None for me... i just wish the magical journey had never ended. Some might think that there is so much battle going on ... but this is what was supposed to happen in this episode after all the GRAND build up .. anything lesser than this would've been unfair.And IMAX format served as a cherry on the cake.In a nutshell, it was a pleasure being a.part.of this adventure along with ever.endearing Bilbo Baggins and all the grumpy yet heroic dwarfs.

I will always have a special place in my heart for the original three Lord of the Rings movies, but this one lived up to their standard. J.R.R.

A Reasonably Effective Conclusion To The Franchise,"A few things to note before I muster up the energy to write a full-blown review.-Legolas is a god and is absolutely hilarious in this film-Thorin's development is initially far too sudden, but evens out as the film goes on. By the end, his arc is understandable and well done.-Howard Shore's score is incredible; a great improvement over the far less impressive The Desolation of Smaug score-The love story which I actually loved in the previous film is so utterly cringe-worthy that I could barely watch whenever it was brought up.-That said, the final scene with Tauriel and Kili is incredible and beautifully constructed.-The visual effects are not as good as they were in The Desolation of Smaug. Whereas in Desolation the visual effects shots had clear grandeur to them, Jackson and Co. dress much of Erebor up with strange pink and grey colouring, as well as distracting smog.-That said, the character models and large-scale battle scenes are incredible. The orcs looked fantastic (particularly Azog), the interior of Erebor is vast and huge, and Smaug once again looks suitably brilliant.-For once, an action director who is willing to hold the shot, and keep from cutting every single hit. The battles and individuals fights are sometimes slightly incoherent, but enjoyable nonetheless-The best opening scene from a film in 2014. The destruction of Lake- Town is harrowing, brilliantly filmed and utterly breathtaking.-Stupid comedic relief from the Lake-Town Master's deputy is stupid. Burn it with fire.-I reiterate, because it's fantastic: Legolas is a god, and I could not for one second (nor could those who accompanied me for the screening) take him serious in battle.-The first act builds up the characters and their arcs brilliantly. Luke Evans shines in these opening scenes.-The second act is lacking and oft-times boring. Too many boring battle scenes that contain no peril, discussions between people that feel repetitive, and stupid character tropes.-The third act ties into The Lord of the Rings, whilst maintaining the emotion and scope of The Hobbit films, concluding the majority of the character's stories.-Bard doesn't get a memorable or definitive resolution. This is an issue.-Jackson's cinematography, as always, is gorgeous. Even if you hate his use of visual effects, you can't doubt that he has gotten better with his camera-work since The Lord of the Rings, utilizing close-ups rarely and swinging his camera with purpose, instead of idly.-Much of the comedy is fantastic, apart that from the aforementioned Lake-Town deputy.-I have to say it once more: Legolas can not be killed.-The performances are all exceptional, even if some of the dialogue is slightly shoddy.-The sound design is fantastic as always, and for once, there are no Wilhelm screams! (there was one in Desolation by the way, in the Extended Edition, during the Thrain scene)-The costumes, make-up and props are award-worthy. Brilliant work once again from all those involved.Ultimately, Jackson brought me to another world, and made me enjoy much of my time there. I can't wait to experience this film alongside both of the other Hobbit pictures, as well as The Lord of the Rings films, as the ending literally ties into the beginning of Fellowship.Congratulations Peter Jackson and all those who have collaborated to bring this amazing vision to the screen. A fantastic but nevertheless faulted ride.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Excellent!,"This is one of the best movies of the year without a doubt regardless of the bad criticism it has gotten!It is understandable that these hobbit movies are not in the same level of the Lord of the Rings trilogy since these are directed to kids as well, but this hobbit trilogy has its beauty of its own and no one can deny that!The battle of the five armies is the best of the trilogy, and in my opinion is the best movie of the genre since the Return of the King back in 2003. From beginning to end we are in the edge of our seat with a fast heart beating pace and personally this is why I love this movie because of the stirring of the emotions and I think this is why we go to see movies to makes us feel and suffer the pain of the characters as well as the joy and happiness.Some people will hate this movie but the majority will love it but there is no doubt that this is a cinematic experience that only happens once in while!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Despite Some Flaws, A Satisfying End!","The third and final installment in the three-part film adaptation based on the novel The Hobbit by J. R. R.

Peter Jackson & Team, give us a dark, yet bombastic action extravagant!'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies' Synopsis: Bilbo and Company are forced to engage in a war against an array of combatants and keep the Lonely Mountain from falling into the hands of a rising darkness.At a 144-minutes, 'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies' is filled with moments of drama & spectacular action-sequences. The Graphics are beyond awesome & the stunts are astounding. I was mesmerized by the film's second-hour, because once the action sets in, you can't move from your seat.Having said that, the first-hour of the film is a mighty bore! Slow & Dull, Jackson's third installment falls short on this count. A stronger, faster first-hour would have done no harm!Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Guillermo del Toro & Jackson's Adapted Screenplay lacks meat for the entire first-hour, but becomes heart-pounding later on. Jackson's Direction is eye-filling. Cinematography & Editing are decent. Graphics are simply awesome. Costume Design & Make-Up are good, too.Performance-Wise: The Wonderful Martin Freeman as the lovable Bilbo Baggins, scores yet again. Sir Ian McKellen is as gripping as ever as Gandalf. Richard Armitage gives a far more serious approach to Thorin this time around, but its an impressive one. And Luke Evans steals the show as the heroic Bard the Bowman. The rest of the ensemble, pitch in credible work, as well.On the whole, 'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies' is surely fun, but not without its flaws. Nonetheless, A Satisfying End!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not the Spectacular Finale We Expected,"December 16, 2014Even for the past two installments of this film franchise, I have been wondering why the title is ""The Hobbit"", when the main story had really been more about Dwarfs. In this film, the chief Dwarf Thorin Oakenshield and his internal conflict was the central plot around which the other stories revolved. Even the Elves Legolas and Tauriel had more scenes than our solitary hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. The only scenes Bilbo totally owned for himself were those in the last five minutes.Within the first 10 minutes, Smaug, the dragon who attacked Laketown at the end of Part 2, was already down and out of the story. For the rest of the 134 minutes running time of this film, we will be watching battle after battle among various armies trying to gain control of the massive trove of gold that Smaug left behind in his old lair in Erebor.Because Thorin was overcome with madness from ""dragon sickness"", he refused to peacefully negotiate with the Humans (led by the Bard) and the Elves (led by Thranduil). This eventually leads to war -- a five-way battle along with two groups of vicious evil Orcs (led by Azog) and finally, the Great Eagles (with Radagast and Beorn). After the conclusion of the battle, Bilbo finally returns back to his home in Bag End after 11 years.If you have seen the past two episodes, the level of acting of the cast is basically the same. Nothing so spectacular, nothing so bad. Richard Armitage does very well in the lead role of Thorin. He imbues the character with dignity and honor, despite his initial turn to the dark side. Other actors who stood out were Aidan Turner as the lovestruck dwarf Kili, and Luke Evans as the Dragonslayer Bard. Aside from seeing Ian McKellen again, it was also good to see a lot of cameos from the original LOTR series, like Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, Christopher Lee and Ian Holm.For a film that is basically all computer-generated effects, the quality of these effects in a lot of key scenes were rather disappointing. There was a scene of Dwarfs riding goats up a rocky mountain that really looked fake. The scene where Legolas hitched a ride on a bat in flight was snicker-inducing. The worst was the scene where Legolas was climbing up rocks as they were falling down from a crumbling bridge. The CG was so bad, it looked like Legolas was running up in thin air.Speaking from the point of view of a non-LOTR fanatic, this whole Hobbit film franchise could have been just one big film or maybe two. Even if it was interesting and engaging, the story felt too overstretched when director Peter Jackson decided to make it into a three film series. The expectations for a truly spectacular finale in this film was not really met fully because this had been marred by some poor visual effects. Despite this lengthy storytelling, this film felt a bit incomplete. There was no scene telling us the aftermath of the battle, nor the fate of the gold, which was the main cause of the war.I felt that the second film, ""The Desolation of Smaug"" was the best of the trilogy. It had the best part of the story, the best action sequences and the best special effects of the three. Anyhow, the tying- in of certain details in this film to the first LOTR film though makes me want to watch that first series all over again. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"MOST of these reviewers are seeing what this film ISN'T, not what it IS. Oh, and watch the extended version","Well, technically ALL the Hobbit movies go with the title of this review, but I'm reviewing only this movie right now...I have read many reviews on here, and have seen an insane amount of 1 out of 10 star reviews, and I notice that MOST of these reviewers seem to be hating on this film for what it ISN'T, not what it is IS. Most of the complaints of what it ISN'T is naturally based on the Hobbit book itself with many added things that were not stated in the book or even some changes of certain deaths or aspects. Let me just say, that I too am a Tolkien fanatic. I have read all of his Middle-Earth books and even study them as if they were a subject in school, and I still love these films (as well as the Lotr trilogy). But I'm going to talk about this film on it's own without comparing it to the source material, because I personally think that these should be looked at as movies first, and adaptations second.So, to me, this is what this movie IS: ---Amazing acting. Every actor -- whether CG or not--genuinely play their roles so well. The actors in this film that stand out to me the most would have to be Martin Freeman, Richard Armitage, and Evangeline Lilly.---The CGI is not at all bad. Yes there is a lot of it used in this movie, but there is wayyy worse CGI out there. Besides, the orcs and troll designs look great. They look like intimating and different proportioned creatures and not just people in make up (not saying that's at all bad.)---The relationship between Thorin and Bilbo was done in a believable and very emotional way.---The romance--though not entirely necessary--was a very touching addition. It shows the beauty of it, as well as the pain.---The drama. This is a movie that is based around one big battle and lots of deaths, so they have to be emotional. That's exactly what this movie is. The emotion may seem different from lotr because of certain ways the characters react, but the emotion of this film is based on subtly from the actor's expressions (another point to the actors.)---The battle scenes are exciting but of course dramatic.---The score is beautiful, intense and intense. It simply sounds amazing thanks to Howard Shore.I loved this film. Sure it is not the best of the three, but it's a very exciting and dramatic film, like it's supposed to be! The only problem I have with the film itself is some of the comedy (Most of Alfrid's scenes) is not really that funny and seems kind of forced. And there are many things I really would have loved to see, but that is part of the whole ""what it is IS and what it isn't"" subject, so that doesn't count for my rating!Oh, but like I said, check out the extended edition! It has much that the theatrical version was lacking.Overall, Theatrical version: 8/10 Extended version: 9/10!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A flawed but fitting final chapter to the Middle-earth legend,"Let me just start off by saying that I am a big fan of The Hobbit and of The Lord of the Rings and they are some of my favourite movies of all time. When I saw the first teaser trailer for this film and the Edge of Night used as nostalgia, I nearly teared up with excitement. I remember the thrill of suddenly really looking forward to this final chapter and I didn't know what to expect, but I got what I was expecting: a great day out with my friends, Dad and sister to what was the greatest cinema experience for me. The movie had everything I wanted, the action, the acting, the tension, the drama, the thrilling sense of an apocalypse and the emotion was there too, and for that I give it full marks for that all combined.However, I have to take down one star for the major problems that I have with this movie that rob it of its masterpiece status. Like Legolas defying gravity and jumping stones like its suddenly a flipping video game in what was one of the worst CGI effects I have ever seen, and lets not forget the dull, badly-done, annoying, purposeless characters of both Tauriel and that love story that didn't have any purpose whatsoever in staying true to the classic source material, the annoying purposeless horrendous character of Alfrid Lickspittle who Peter Jackson thought was too much to kill off finally and was like ""hey I've got a great idea, lets just put in a character named Alfrid and he will always sneak into the movie and make the entire film fade out of its plot, he'll just be there to add in pointless unfunny humour."" I hate to be so negative about this movie, but I cannot help but say that all these things are just too unforgivable and if Peter Jackson could've cut all of those things out of the movie, then it would've been a better film. Also, what exactly was Legolas' purpose in the first place? Is he just there to kill orcs and to make sure that this is the same universe as The Lord of the Rings trilogy? I don't mind him being in there, but he just doesn't really have a lot of purpose to the story and I don't know why they thought that that laughable gravity defying stunt he pulled off was really necessary.I'm not to bothered about some other loose ends not being tied up, because they will explain that in the Extended Edition, but what really matters is what they put in the cinemas. Like, will we see DÃ¡in become king?Will we see the funeral of Thorin, FÃ­li and KÃ­li? Or the reinforcements for the dwarf army coming on those rams and goats that Thorin, Dwalin,FÃ­li and KÃ­li use to ride the Ravenhill to kill Azog? Or Bard becoming the king of New Dale and DÃ¡in giving to him what was promised of the treasure to rebuild? Or them placing the arkenstone and Thorin's sword, Orcist within his crypt? Or whether or not Thranduil is going to get those gems of pure starlight back? Or the long awaited death of Alfrid? There are also some scenes that will make you very questionable about the film. Like how after four movies of this never happening did Legolas suddenly run out of arrows? Bard using his own son, Bain, as an arrow, how DÃ¡in and Thorin suddenly decide to hug and talk in the middle of a raging battle, and there's an overuse of a lazy action movie clichÃ© that is last minute rescues. I mean like there's always someone in danger and then, suddenly someone else comes out of nowhere to save them at the last minute. Its very repetitive and you thought Michael Bay had a obsessive use of explosions in his films. It just gets on my nerves a little.So all of these things I have mentioned is what ruins the reputation of the film and they just need to be removed from the film completely. Still, I love this film, I've seen it four times at the cinema and I now have it on DVD and I couldn't be more happier now that I have one of my favourite franchise finales on DVD (and also with the fact that I can now skip through the love story, Legolas jumping stones and Alfrid).I know that the Dol Guldur scenes weren't in the book, but I don't really mind it being put in the film because it explains what Gandalf left the company for in the book (which wasn't entirely explained) and because it also ties the franchise up with TLOTR trilogy perfectly and it was awesome to see Sauron and Galadriel go face to face with each other. That was one of the best scenes in the film. I also liked the addition of Sir Christopher Lee's Saruman, seeing as the actor who played him recently passed away and it was good to see him retake his role of one his greatest villains ever.Martin Freeman and Richard Armitage dominate every scene of the film in their perfectly acted Oscar worthy performances as Bilbo Baggins and Thorin Oakenshield. Oh, and The Last Goodbye song at the end is a perfect way to end it. The song still moves me today.Even though this film is flawed, everything else was what we all wanted, the acting, the action, the amazing visuals and the conclusion was all exactly all I could've asked for in this film and its a triumphant send-off to Middle-earth.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Far far far far worse than I'd feared,"The LOTR Trilogy was spectacular but somehow I'd missed the Hobbit so I decided to binge watch all three movies over the course of 3 nights. Having read the book a number of times in my youth I was somewhat surprised that they had made a 9 hour trilogy of this work and I set my hopes fairly low that this series would deliver. An Unexpected Journey came nowhere near my low expectation and I considered not watching The Desolation of Smaug but I did and I wasn't surprised that,if anything this film was worse than the first. My masochism must have kicked in at this point as I forced myself to watch the third and final instalment - The Battle of the Five Armies that set a new standard in awful. What the hell was this slash fest all about? I had to wind back the sequence when Thorin dies three times before I could make any sense of it I still failed. He's stabbed in an area of his chest as close to his heart as you could get yet still manages to kill his adversary and then gets up to have a walk round with no sign of a wound!! he then collapses and dies.# What was all that about? Dreadful series of films. I'm annoyed with myself that i wasted 9 hours of my life watching it.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A very short review of ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" (2014)","I think that ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" (2014) is the best of Peter Jackson's prequel trilogy, and not only because of its predictably terrific climactic battle. I'd give this movie a 9 out of 10.First, it's less cartoonish and far more adult than its predecessors, in everything from its themes to its fight choreography. (Compare the beautifully staged final melees here, for example, with that Warner Brothers-esque sequence in the second film, in which the dwarfs dance across barrels and river rapids to repel their orc pursuers.)It also seems like a better peek at a larger fantasy universe, with different races, armies and cultures working at cross purposes before needing to align, and with more than one protagonist's real failings factoring in to that.And Â… HOT DAMN! That's GOTTA be the greatest depiction of a dragon I've ever seen. One small quibble I've had throughout all of Jackson' Tolkien films was that the stories' antagonists sometimes seemed too silly and clownish to be truly menacing. (The orcs, trolls and goblins seemed cartoonish and are too easily defeated by beings sometimes half their height; only the Nazguls and the Uruk- Hai hybrids managed to impress.) Jackson's depiction of Smaug ravaging Laketown makes dragons look like Middle Earth's equivalent of a goddam nuclear device.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A fantastic ending to the trilogy, leaving an avid LOTR fan wanting more","A fantastic ending to the trilogy, leaving an avid LOTR fan wanting more! The Hobbit finale seems to have a lot of negative energy around it, concerning bad CGI and unnecessary story elements, which is understandable for die hard fans of the book and original stories. I for one, am not. As a watcher of the films and non-reader of the books, I felt like 'The Battle of Five Armies' tied together The Hobbit story perfectly and without a single dull moment. I was so drawn into the fantasy, the 'lack' of effective CGI was not noticed. Would highly recommend to any LOTR/Hobbit fans of course, as well as anyone with any interest in 'epic' adventure fantasy movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Legendarium who could have been better,"The Hobbit: The Battle Of The Five armies was a movie I both longed to see but also dreaded to see. For knowing that it was the last of the Hobbit movies I felt sad that the adventure in Middle-Earth was about to come to an end but at the same time I felt excited to see how the ending would turn out. Having read The Hobbit book before the movie came out I already knew which characters would die, and what would happen in the main parts of the story but still I looked forward to see it all on the big screen.I liked both of the two other movies and have always looked at the movies and books in separate ways as I believe the two mediums are simply too different to compare with each other. However for me this movie sadly failed on many levels, and the only thing keeping it together was the continuing excellence of the actors.The overuse of CGI really killed a lot of magic in this movie and I've heard it did so for many others as well. CGI was of course used in both Desolation of Smaug & An Unexpected Journey but not as much and in the same way as it was used here. It felt as if the production was very rushed and sadly this caused many things to simply be replaced by CGI and pointless scenes of action. And the many scenes with Legolas also annoyed me as even though I like the character and the performance of Orlando Bloom, it simply felt that it was far too much and that focusing so much time on a character who are not even mentioned in the book just felt wrong and misplaced. It is really a shame that the production company did not give Peter Jackson and crew more time to give this legendarium the ending it deserved, as it felt that much could have been improved.The scenes that are good in the movie are however very good, as once again the amazing actors/actress delivers great performances. However all in this movie ends a very unique trilogy and even though it is the weakest of the three it is still a movie that all lovers of fantasy should see (If you have watched the other two).7/10 Good!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

And what about very old friends?,"'The Hobbit: The Battle Of The Five Armies (2014)' is the concluding chapter in Peter Jackson's 'Lord Of The Rings' prequel trilogy. It primarily concerns - you guessed it - a battle between five armies, one which takes up almost half of the affair's overall runtime. Despite being the shortest 'Middle-Earth' movie by quite a margin, the picture is still arguably too long and it really indulges in the mostly CGI carnage that occurs during its eponymous skirmish. Still, that skirmish is typically quite a bit of fun. It's energetic and exciting, perfectly toeing the line between chaos and choreography. It does get a bit tiring after a while, primarily during the segments in which faceless armies charge into each other in an emotionless clash of steel and swords, and it's also very obviously digital, to the point that it sometimes even looks like something out of a video game. Sometimes, the laws of physics take a back seat, too (Legolas' silly little run up some falling stones springs to mind). There are a few nice character moments here and there, though; these inject both personality and stakes back into proceedings, reminding us of the characters we care about and the fact that their lives are at risk. The more personal one-to-one battles generally work better than the army-to-army ones, principally because they're easier to parse and maintain a keen focus on the characters involved with them. The main characters get some much needed development in the build up to and aftermath of all the chaos. Thorin, especially, undergoes an unexpected but welcome arc that takes him to a dark place and allows Richard Armitage to showcase his acting skills. A scene near the end of the film involving him and Bilbo, once again portrayed excellently by Martin Freeman, is arguably the film's highlight; it's a genuinely emotional reflection on the characters' relationship. The picture is generally pacy, but it does still feel a tad long in places. You get the feeling that it is being milked for all it is worth, especially since the overall story - say it with me - should have been told across two movies instead of three. In terms of structure, the piece front-loads itself with some of its least interesting stuff (after its opening few minutes, anyway). Obviously, that doesn't do it any favours. Neither does the fact that its major battle happens for fairly unconvincing reasons, erupting from a fairly petty squabble. This could be thematically interesting, a comment on the futility of war and the way in which the flawed temperament of someone in power can lead to dire consequences for those around them, but it isn't explored all that well and it isn't long before it falls away entirely in favour of a traditional good vs evil affair. The flick also opens with what ought to have been the ending of 'The Hobbit: The Desolation Of Smaug (2013)', which means it starts out feeling like it's about to finish and then slows to a crawl as it builds momentum for its own elongated finale. The opening isn't bad, but it's the ending to another movie and its inclusion just feels weird (especially since it only gives Smaug about six minutes of screen time and heavily reduces his villainous impact). Despite its problems, the picture is entertaining. It's undeniably enjoyable and it's also never boring. It's as mindless as it is fun. Ultimately, it's a satisfying in-the-moment experience, but a somewhat disappointing 'Middle-Earth' movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One last time,"The hobbit: The battle of the five armies is the last film in the hobbit series. This film takes place right were the second one left off. The movie is about bilbo and the dwarfs take their homeland back but different armies are ready to fight for it,so now they have to defend it. I will first say this one is very different from the other two because they made it dark and took out the kid feel. The whole battle itself was very impressive but not as good as ""the return of the king"". There was a lot of character development in Thorin(Richard armitage) which was good because he played a big role in this one. The acting was great by everyone. Another great thing the movie did was lead it into the lord of the rings. The only downside of the movie was Alfrid(Ryan Gage). His character tried to be funny but it just didn't work for the movie. So overall if you enjoy the other Hobbit movies,you will enjoy this one. A farewell to middle-earth.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Least Appetising Film Title of 2014,"If your idea of fun is over two hours of orcs, dwarves, elves & sundry other hirsute warriors scampering about, engaging in long, portentous speeches and generally squaring up against each other then this is the movie for you.I actually read 'The Hobbit' as a kid and loved it. Turning Tolkien's charming little book into yet another sprawling trilogy in the wake of 'The Lord of the Rings' was obviously only ever a commercial decision (which was why the interminable 'The Desolation of Smaug' was so excruciatingly drawn-out). But at least the threatened massed battle is actually over fairly quickly and - although it as usual takes an awfully long time getting there - being the third part of a trilogy you know that things will, eventually, come to a proper conclusion this time round.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Too much going on, but an adequate resolution to this trilogy","The third - and final - Hobbit film is a valiant attempt to recapture the 'Lord of the Rings' magic of Middle Earth, but too often feels tired and repetitive, especially in the sixth film in the franchise. It's by no means bad, it's just - as with the first two Hobbit films - unnecessarily padded, with lots of flashbacks and scenes of staring into the distance. I'm still not convinced the three Hobbit films couldn't have worked as one cohesive 3 & a bit hour film...Even though the second film featured his name in the title, Smaug (Cumberbatch) is quickly dealt with and the plot hastily progresses to be about the humans - led by Bard (Evans) - tying to move into the Mountain with the Dwarves - led by Thorin (Armitage) & a mostly redundant cameo from Dain (Connolly). To complicate things, the Elves - led by Legolas (Bloom)'s dad - show up too and then the Orcs arrive. By my count, that's four armies. The fifth army never really eventuates... Gandalf (McKellen) & Bilbo (Freeman) are left stuck in the middle of all this.There's some quick appearances from Elrond (Weaving), Galadriel (Blanchett) & Saruman (Lee), which are unnecessary and don't add to the plot. There's some good battle scenes, but nothing to top 'The Two Towers' or 'The Return of the King'. Some mild humour thrown in, but a lot of the film feels bogged down and aware it's ""the defining chapter"" or ""the final farewell"" as it's been billed.Plenty of frustrating moments - Tauriel (Lilly)'s ""romance"" with Kili (Turner), Thorin's ""dragon sickness"", the get-out-of-jail-card that the Eagles pose. Despite these, the score is still great, with the use of the familiar motifs still effective and the cinematography beautiful.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It Really Wasn't That Bad.  I'll Be Concise.,"I read some of the bad reviews of this film and I don't know why they are being so harsh. It wasn't that bad. Well maybe it's because I'm not a big fan of stories about wizards, elves, goblins, and magic, although I enjoyed the Hell out of ""Legend"" and ""Labyrinth"", and I know little about J.R.R. Tolkien's books, just what I have seen in the theaters. To me this film was pretty much like the others, including ""The Lord of the Ring"" trilogy. I thought all of them were good. From what I have read from some of the other reviews there were some unanswered questions in the film that were covered in the books. I can see where that can be a problem for the ones who read and are into the books but for the ones who never read the books, if you liked the other ""Hobbit"" and ""The Lord of the Ring"" films you'll probably like this one too.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Felt rushed,"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies closed the chapter of Peter Jackson's trilogy of Middle Earth. Now that the dragon is long gone, Thorin and the dwarves take hold of their gold and Thorin doesn't want to share his wealth with those that served to help protect the mountain. He was being stubborn and obsessed with finding the Arkenstone, the one true treasure that made him feel like mad and greedy. The story dived right down to battle with lots of orcs being killed with one swing of the bat. The title should have changed to be the fates of each of the dwarves to defeat Sauron.

The end. At last.,"Almost fifteen years ago, I was genuinely excited to see The Lord of the Rings brought to life by director Peter Jackson. Now, six Middle Earth films later, with countless hours spent watching extravagant CGI battles, sweeping shots of spectacular scenery and grandiose architecture, happy hobbits, angry orcs, athletic elves, dour dwarfs and wise old wizards, I couldn't be happier. That it's finally all over.With each successive Tolkien film, I could feel my enthusiasm growing steadily weaker and weaker. As the CGI became more and more elaborate, the action became more and more preposterous, so much so that I could no longer suspend my disbelief. Legolas repeatedly defying all the laws of physics became painful to watch. Although I should have loved The Hobbit movies, the book being my favourite work by Tolkien, I found the whole bloated experience frustratingly tiresome, with The Battle of the Five Armies being the most disappointing of all.Having already realised the majority of The Hobbit in the first two films, there really is very little story left for Jackson to tell, so he pads out this third chapter with pointless romance, internal conflict and even more CGI-heavy battles, all of which proves relentlessly dull if you've already seen the director's other five Middle Earth movies. Needless to say, I was more than pleased to see Bilbo arrive safely back at Bag End, just so that I could say a very final farewell.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"It's no Return of the King, but it served its purpose","I'm a little surprised by all the negative reviews here on IMDB. Sure, it's not as good as Return of the King but it did conclude the adventures of Bilbo Baggins and the dwarves in their quest to free the dwarves' ancestral home. There was action and thrills plus battle scenes that could make everything else look tame. The Hobbit trilogy may not be as good as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but it's still better than the Star Wars prequel trilogy. If you don't care for the Hobbit trilogy's theatrical cuts, at least give the extended editions a chance. You can find a boxed set of the extended cuts at any movie store. I watched them and enjoyed all of them, especially the third one. They're a little long but they're worth it. Anyway, I'm getting off-topic here.

"""I can't believe all this is behind us.""","Time to say goodbye to middle earth for the last time.The story is about Dwarven party led by Thorin Oakenshield finally reclaims their kingdom of Erebor, the vast treasure draws out now only the wrath of Smaug but also the army of men and elves, who want the fortune for their own.Let me give you a quick feed back of the other two films then to this one. A unexpected Journey I thought was pretty amazing... when I first sawed it, after a couple of watchers later it's not as amazing as the first time, but I still enjoyed it even with the problems showing. Desolation of smaug in my opinion was way better and way more fun and better film paste then Unexpected Journey, and Smaug as the villain was icing on the cake. Now we got Battle of the Five Armies and I can conform that the movie is actually pretty good and it's a solid finale to The Hobbit series.Peter Jackson directs this movie in a way that middle earth feels like a real pace that we can go to anytime we want and I got to give him that. Jackson clearly adores middle earth as he really doesn't want it to end and I can see why, it probably makes him feel at home directing these movies and sometimes leaving you home behind sucks.The visual effect's at times looked really good and once again this movie had that shiny mix with grey color with the character's Armour and the background of beautiful New Zealand. But I like the Lord of the Rings effect's a little better, why you may ask. because the effect's in that movie still holds up today but that's just me... maybe.The all the cast members did a outstanding job, Ian Mckellen will always be Gandalf because his the best, Martian Freeman did a fantastic job playing Bilbo Baggins and to be honest I like Bilbo Baggins more then frodo in my opinion.My biggest problems with the film is some of the visual effect's in the movie looks very noticeable and I had the same problem with the other two films. The love story between Kili (The Dwarf) and Tauriel (The Elf), I didn't find their romance plot to really needed for the film and when something bad happens to the two of them I just sitting thinking ""Well stuff happens"".Overall The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies is a solid final to the Hobbit series with some problems there and then. Good action scenes, good performances and a brutal fight scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good, but not brilliant","Saw this in Imax 3D at the first showing in B'ham UK. I had to queue, at 0945! In the am! Firstly, you need to be up to date with both the last movie Desolation of Smaug, and the first (Fellowship of the Ring : first and still the best). Some scenes which might seem non-sequitur rely on an enthusiast's recall of the original story and the preceding two movies in this latest trilogy. The rather thin plot, which follows upon the demise of the lovely Cumberbatch in the disguise of the loathsome Smaug (not a spoiler I hope) revolves on the Dwarf King wanting to hold on to more gold than there actually is, at least in this world (or any other I strongly suspect) - anyway, enough to disturb the balance of earthly economies. So that's the first 1/2-hour dealt with. The rest of the film is a confusing battle between Dwarfs on the inside (with gold), Men and Elves on the outside (who want the gold), Dwarf Cousin Billy Connolly and his mates on the outside (who want to help the little guys on the inside keep their gold), and no fewer than two whole armies of the spectacularly-poor-warrior Orcs on the outside who don't want the gold, just the whole mountain, together with everyone's death. No change there, then. Gandalf, as usual, flits ineffectually in and out of the movie to give some continuity with the previous screenings. And no-one needs to eat or go to the toilet. If you like Dungeons and Dragons, you'll love this. If you liked Lord of the Rings, you may be disappointed. It was all rather 2-dimensional for a 3D-movie. And me? I loved it, can't wait to see it again.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hobbit:the best of the best,An amazing movie with fantastic scenes and gorgeous battles!I believe that the best scene of the movie was when lady Galadriel won Saouron.Also another good scene was when Thorin changed his mind and return to the battle.But Legolas was the best of the best in this movie.He is my favourite actor since i saw lord of the rings.Also gorgeous was the scene where Thrandouil fought almost 20 orks alone before his men come and help him.It was an amazing movie one of the best i've ever see.So i vote the movie with five(5) stars which means excellent!I hope there were more movies like Hobbit but there are not!Teo Paz,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A fitting capstone to an epic franchise.,"On December 17, 2003, The Return of the King ended perhaps the greatest film trilogy of modern times, culminating in a practical Oscar sweep, tying only two other films for the record number of awards. Almost 11 years later, The Battle of the Five Armies closes another film trilogy.However, don't expect The Return of the King when going to see this.The tag line for this film, One Last Time, is fitting, and sets the mood for the whole film, as it serves as a big good-bye from Middle Earth. As the title suggests, Thorin, having reclaimed the Lonely Mountain, has to face many different armies in order to protect the dwarfs' home.Bilbo Baggins, on the other hand, sees through Thorin's mask of righteousness to another battle raging inside Thorin: whether to keep his word or protect his gold.At 144 minutes, it will feel like this film is not as long as the other films in the franchise, which may disappoint people who come to see three hours plus of Middle Earth action. Others may be let down by the seemingly disappointing ending, which ends where An Unexpected Journey began.Nevertheless, with all of its warts, this movie is worth seeing if only to experience a Lord of the Rings movie one last time.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One word: travesty,"Before seeing _The Battle of the Five Armies_ today, I told people, ""The first two films lacked fidelity to the book, but this one should be better."" I figured Jackson wouldn't have to add lots of extraneous invented action scenes because the final third of the book contained plenty of action.Boy, was I wrong.Unnecessary invented characters from the previous films continued to take up screen time in this one, and many new ones were added. Tolkien wouldn't recognize a bunch of grand-scale evildoers or various ""good guys"" whose relationships were supposed to tug at our hearts, though they turned my stomach instead.The additions included plenty of trite dialogue. When one invented character, in a scene made from whole cloth, was shown weeping over a loved one and asking ""Why does it hurt so much?"", I just about tossed my Junior Mints.Meanwhile, a character largely responsible for turning the tide in the book's Battle of Five Armies (note the lack of a ""the"" before ""Five"") was shown in the film, without explanation, for about three seconds. Blink and you might miss it.When one baddie was apparently killed, I thought, ""If he suddenly jumps up and starts fighting again, I'm leaving."" Too bad I didn't follow through on my threat after that excruciatingly predictable plot twist.Did I mention that Dain, confronting the elf warriors, came across as some nightmare parody of John Cleese performing ""The Lord of the Fawlty Towers""?I could go on, but ""travesty"" is about the kindest word I can use for this mass of claptrap. I now fear that Jackson will film _The Silmarillion_, turning it into yet another tawdry, over-the-top CGI fest.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A Really Great Movie, to end a Very Good Trilogy!","""The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies"" concludes ""The Hobbit"" Trilogy â€“ 3 Movies based on 1 Book, a prequel to ""The Lord of The Rings"" Trilogy of books, made into 3 movies prior to the Prequel Trilogy â€“ The Books all written by J. R. R Tolken, all the films Directed by Director Peter Jackson. The movie picks up where the last one - ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" left off - with the Dragon ""Smaug"", voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch, about to attack the city of Laketown, after his departure from the Lonely Mountain, now reclaimed by the Dwarfs, led by ""Thorin"", played by Richard Armitage. The Dwarfs have been aided by among others, the Hobbit ""Bilbo Baggins"", played by Martin Freeman, the Wizard ""Gandalf the Grey"", played by Sir Ian McKellan (reprising his role from the LOTR Trilogy), and Elves ""Legolas"", played by Orlando Bloom (also reprising his role from the LOTR Trilogy), ""Tauriel"", played by Evangeline Lily, and Lakestown resident ""Bard the Bowman"", played by Luke Evans. Overall â€“ I enjoyed the movie very much. The Visual Effects and Cinematography are wonderful. The Battle scenes are a joy. Emotions are often stirred, by great acting, particularly in the love triangle relationship of Lily's ""Tauriel"", Dwarf ""Kili"", played by Aidan Turner, and Bloom's ""Legolos"". Other highlights for the acting would be the journey the character of ""Thorin"" takes, as well Freeman and McKellan's performances of ""Bilbo"" and ""Gandalf"" the Grey respectively, continuing to fight to bring everyone together for the battle that centers the 2nd Half of the Movie. Luke Evan's also gives a great performance as ""Bard the Bowman"" - a man trying to save his family, and lead his townspeople at the same time, as well as attempting to keep the peace by all to avoid War during the 1st half of the movie. There are a few moments that maybe could have been improved, but it doesn't hurt much for the overall enjoyment. I thought the first movie, ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" was alright, and I really liked ""The Hobitt: The Desolation of Smaug"". So â€“ a really great movie to end a very good trilogy â€“ 3 Â½ out of 4 Stars.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Outstanding awesome - well done Mr Jackson - he deserves an Oscar,True I didn't think there was enough material for 3 films but I understand why Peter Jackson didn't want to cut anything out. I read the Hobbit when I was 10 years old and the Lord of Rings for the first time was I was 12 years. I waited nearly my whole life for the Hobbit to be made into a film and I think only Peter Jackson could have done it. After his brilliant adaption of the Lord of the Rings I knew he could do the Hobbit justice even if he did add and embellish some of the story. This man deserves an Oscar for giving us not 3 films but 6 films of just epic entertainment. I wish JRR Tolkein could have seen his books brought to life on the big screen as I sure he would have proud of them. But of course the Oscar Committee do not like films that are popular or entertaining to the masses.,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A disappointment, yet an enjoyable watch","This movie is a disappointment in the sense that it is incredibly commercial. The over- use of CGI combined with over-the-top action sequences downgraded the movie greatly. It is a shame since the first two installments had managed to encapsulate the spirit and the tone of the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. Overall, it felt more like i was watching the Matrix or Transformers than a poetic movie about The Hobbit. Sadly, Martin Freemen the actual Hobbit has very few screen time.This being said, as an action-packed movie, I did actually enjoy this film and found myself laughing quite a few times.

Farewell Middle Earth,"Although it wasn't the best way to bid farewell with that EXTRAORDINARY universe, but it'll always remain miles ahead of any other cinematic universe(The galaxy far far away,Hogwarts,....). This universe incorporated each and every human feeling, it showed us the true nature of Men. Greediness, courage, ambition, disloyalty, fear,love and friendship these feelings make us human. The Battle Of The Five Armies was indeed a major letdown in the context of the series. But if it's reviewed as a separate movie if we decided to forget The Lord Of the Rings series. This movie is good. Peter Jackson can still manage wars on a gigantic scale. Still the movie lacks the spirit of the lord of the rings like the 2 previous installments. As for me, i wanted to see what will happen between Saruman and Sauron. what happened to alter his loyalty. On the other hand, the movie explored some hidden secrets the relationship between Lady Galadriel and Gandalf.

All Hope Is Not Lost,"Once upon a time, Peter Jackson was overwhelmingly lauded for translating a literary masterpiece into a cinematic masterpiece: the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Despite their immense runtimes, there was never a wasted momentâ€”in fact, the fans begged for an even longer cut of these films (these cuts turned out to be 20-40 minutes longer, still without any hint of overstretching). There was so much to explore in that classically grim and grand tale, adapted from three separate sizable novels (the original LOTRâ€”although once compiled into one enormous book by J.R.R. Tolkienâ€”was split into three books by the publisher later on).However, Tolkien's prequel, The Hobbit, doesn't have that much material in one single novel to warrant three 2 Â½ hour movies, which is why this recent trilogy has honestly overstayed its welcome and presented us with a seriously disposable middle pointâ€”The Desolation of Smaugâ€”that barely contributed to the overall narrative. Jackson, like George Lucas, has simply become so fanatically passionate about this world that he'd be willing to showcase every acre of Middle Earth if it was his choice; in a way, that's sweet (or there could be a more cynical aspect to it), but few people are asking for this much. The Battle of Five Armies immediately begins with the ultimate clash against Smaug (that last segment of Desolation of Smaug could've just been inserted here and everything else therein scrapped), which ends fairly quickly only for the situation to now center on Thorin's gradually corrupting mindâ€”his obstinate, greedy hold over the treasure he has finally reached in the vast caves of the Lonely Mountains. A colossal war soon ensues, involving the dwarfs, the humans, the elves, the eagles, and the orcs, over this goldâ€”lust for wealth and power has always been a motif in the tales of Middle Earth.Entering the theater with lowered expectations following disappointment from the last entry, I actually walked out surprised with how wildly entertaining the film was throughout most of its duration. At this point, some of the more central characters and relationships were fully developed, allowing for more audience investment in their arcs and endgames. The riveting dynamic between Thorin (Richard Armitage) and Bilbo (Martin Freeman), in particular, remained the highlight, as well as the fuel to carry the film from a slower build-up to a climactic finale with satisfying pace. Aside from its ending, which was dragged out with a totally relaxed and plodding speed almost to the excruciating extent of Return of the King, there was never a dull moment that even remotely compared to the boringly prolonged sequence with Smaug towards the end of its predecessor. When there wasn't interestingly-choreographed and colossally-scoped action on-screen, the intriguing evolution of certain characters' paths was placed at the forefront. Moreover, while the orcs were as effortless to kill as ever, the primary villains (Azog, Bolg) took arduous, calculating confrontations with powered warriors like Legolas, Tauriel, Thorin, Gandalf, and more to overcome.On the other hand, instead of putting effort into utilizing impeccable practical effects to meticulously assemble a believable Middle Earth like Jackson accomplished with the LOTR trilogy, the use of CGI this time around really makes everything appear so cartoony and cheap for such a big-budget epic. The first twenty minutes of the picture specifically exhibit The Hobbit at its visual worst with the sight of an animated-like village being ravaged by unconvincing fire effects. Perhaps, the creatures seem fascinatingly-envisioned, especially Smaug, but the whole production occasionally looks like one giant cartoonâ€” totally unlike LOTR.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
bad movie,"Don't watch this movie (in 3D) They had one job, make a nice battle and yet, they ruined it. Everybody is randomly attacking everybody and during the whole film you' re thinking more about what the 5 armies are than actually enjoying the movie. Bad character development, eagles ex machina AGAIN and unrealistic scenes made it even worse. The 3D experience was absolutely sickening: except the 3D glasses I only noticed once 3D-effects. So if you watched LOTR and Hobbit 1 & 2 like me (I liked all of them, LOTR obviously more than the Hobbit-movies). Don't watch the Hobbit: Battle of the five armies. I know it will be hard ending with the cliffhanger at the end of the movie but it will be worth it. To end with on a positive note: the best 10 seconds where at the end of the movie because that's the LOTR.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Probably the weakest of the LOTR series, but still worth your time","There's a lot of stuff I like in ""The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies"", and not just because it's another film set in J.R.R. Tolkien's wonderful world of Middle Earth. There's also some things that make this a flawed film, perhaps, story-wise, the weakest of the three parts of the Hobbit movie. If you're not caught up with the series, you're out of luck because you won't understand a thing that's going on here. The story begins where it left off, with Smaug the dragon attacking Laketown. As Bilbo (Martin Freeman) is caught in the ensuing conflict caused partially because of Thorin Oakenshield's greed (Thorin played by Richard Armitage) and partially by the Necromancer's armies converging on the people of Middle Earth who are seeking refuge or riches in Erebor. One thing that shocked me with the advertising of the film is the amount of attention being given to Benedict Cumberbatch. If you're catching this movie to hear his terrific performance as Smaug you will be severely disappointed because he is not in the film a whole lot. This leads me into my biggest criticism of both this movie and of the trilogy overall. I reserved judgment on whether or not a single book could be split up into three movies until I saw all three films. Now, I'd say that there was enough material to make two films, not quite three. It's really obvious with the way the first half-hour this movie plays out that they really had to carefully choose where to put filler material in order to have three movies that ended on an exciting climax AND a cliff hanger. I can't go much into it, but you will wonder if some of the early developments of this film couldn't have been included in that second movie. BofFA, more than either of the other two films also falls into some of the trappings that plague prequels. I'm talking about people dropping names or pointing out locations just so you can go ""I get that reference!"" I've got just a few other criticisms, and then we're going to move onto what I liked about the film. My first complaint is because of the nature of this film's story, orcs are made to look like total chumps. Count how many battle-worthy characters we've got. Bilbo, Gandalf, Thorin, Legolas, Bard, Tauriel, Thranduil, Dwaling, Balin, KÃ­li, FÃ­li, Dori, Nori, Ori, Ã“in, GlÃ³in, Bifur, Bofur. If only half are involved in combat and given their time to shine, that's a huge amount of orcs that have to be killed solely to show off our heroes' skills. I thought that in many scenes, the legions of orcs were so easily dispatched that they might as well have been those idiotic robots from ""Star Wars: Episode I"". Finally, there's Ryan Gage as Alfrid, who is the most cartoonish, two-dimensional villains I've seen in any of these Middle Earth films. His role is pointless and should have been cut out to focus more on the main characters. Now that we've gotten that out of the way, we can talk about what works. What I really enjoyed is that even though this is the 6th film in the series, it still contains plenty of new sights. We've never witnessed what an army of Dwarfs looks like, or some of the creatures and locations in this film. I found that while some of the big battles in the story lacked impact, there was a lot of tension in the most personal moments of combat, particularly the mano-y-mano sequences with Bolg or Azog against our heroes. I found that the film really complimented the other films very well in terms of scale and spectacle. If you have the fortune of watching these films in chronological order, you will see a great progression in terms of sweeping character arcs and a real escalation in the threats of the opponents and in the battles that are fought. The visuals in the film are once again grandiose and it never felt like anything here was just a rehash of the earlier moments in the series. I found that there were more than a few really powerful and tense moments, even when no one was fighting. Particularly in the way that Thorin's character is focused on during the film, I was excited to see his character change over time and I was scared when his personality changed for the darker. There are some very nice subtle moments where you can spot the tiniest hints of where characters will ultimately go once the LOTR comes around and they felt very organic. I do feel like it is a satisfying conclusion and even more important, it makes you excited to watch both the previous films so that you can get the whole story of Bilbo Baggins in one fell swoop and that it awakened an incredible desire in me to marathon the other Lord of the Rings films. Overall I would say that this trilogy isn't nearly as good as the films that follow it, but it does a good job of tying together two stories that are widely different in tone. I had several problems with ""Battle of the Five Armies"", but ultimately I did enjoy it. My suggestion to really relish the film is to watch at least ""The Desolation of Smaug"" in the 24 hours preceding your viewing of this film. That high you get from seeing Smaug finally take flight will get you excited to see the big opening here and you will be able to fully immerse yourself in the best parts of BotFA, which are the subtle hints of what is yet to come, the personal moments between the characters we've seen evolve over time and the satisfying final showdown between the heroes and the villains. ""Battle of the Five Armies"" is flawed, but it's an epic fantasy film that wraps this larger-than-life series nicely.

A Charming End to the Hobbit Trilogy,"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies continues where the Desolation of Smaug left off. It uses some of the best modern technology available to create some really fun, entertaining, and over the top action scenes. In this movie, friendships are measured, alliances are forged, and grievances are opened, as the tension builds up to a final battle, and conclusion.In this movie, the role of the dwarfs, with the exception of Thorin, diminish. This gives Thorin's character, (played by Richard Armitage), a chance to shine as a dark, brooding king consumed by greed, conflicted with loyalties, and losing his mind. This wouldn't be a Hobbit movie without Bilbo, (played by Martin Freeman). The quirkiness, appeal, and charm of the movie rests with Bilbo, and he has many great on screen moments.The crux of the movie is in the battle of the five armies, and the CGI parts of the film are filled with great detail, and set an epic atmosphere unmatched by the other two films.As a fan of the Hobbit Trilogy, the final movie, isn't really a disappointment. It wraps up all the story arcs, leaving all questions answered. Though it doesn't match my expectations for being a great movie, it is a good popcorn action flick, and should be seen in IMAX 3D. If you are looking for a great, grand concluding film which matches the other Lord of the Ring films, you might be disappointed. But if you are looking for an entertaining conclusion to the Hobbit trilogy you won't be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A well-done send-off to a decent film series,"So... That was The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies. The final film in Peter Jackson's six-film Middle-Earth saga.This may just be Jackson's most ambitious film yet. It has to work as a standalone film, it has to be the final part of a trilogy, and it has to be the bridge between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings films. Ambitious?Let me state for the record that I'm an enormous fan of the Lord of the Rings films. I consider them to be the best trilogy of all time. However, I didn't really have that same vibe with the Hobbit films. I admit, when I heard they would begin making more Middle-Earth films, I was excited. The thought of returning to Middle-Earth was exhilarating.Then, in December 2012, the first Hobbit film has its release. I was disappointed. It may have been because I didn't know what to expect, but it certainly wasn't what I had hoped it would be. There was too much goofy humor, and it was close to putting me to sleep at times.Come December 2013, The Desolation of Smaug is released. Looking back, I think that this film was intended to split audiences. This film deviated so much from its source material that, at times, I forgot what I was watching. Suddenly, there was a Dwarf-Elf love story, suddenly Thorin's company of Dwarfs split up, suddenly they're fighting Smaug, and then the film ends.Now, here we are in 2014, with the conclusion to the Hobbit films, The Battle of the Five Armies. This film literally starts off where Desolation left off, with Smaug destroying Lake- Town. A breathtaking sequence. Beautiful visuals remind us that Thorin's actions will bring some devastating consequences.However, the sequence loses me a bit by cutting away to the Master of Lake-Town and Alfrid, who I guess were meant to be comic relief, but I ended up wishing they'd die. Not because I didn't like their characters, but because I thought they were so annoying and distracting from the overall experience.After a very Lord of the Rings-esque recovery scene, we meet Bilbo and Thorin's half company of Dwarfs at Erebor, and you can tell Thorin has changed. He's become sick with the aptly named Dragon Sickness, and Bilbo can tell that something isn't quite right about him. Little do they know that Azog (Who is, like, the evilest thing ever.) is marching towards Erebor, as well as the Elvenking 'Mr. Fabulous' Thranduil, is also moving towards Erebor, resulting in a literal clash of the titans.What we end up with is an enormous battle, so large in fact, that it shares title with the film. And now is also when Peter Jackson displays his qualities and faults as a film director. He manages to makes his battles very intimate, despite the chaos that you see on the screen. However, he has shown a particular love for goofy stuff, and after three films, he finally almost got it. There still is goofiness for people who crave that, but for the rest of us it comes off as dumb excuses for cheap laughs.But damn, this film has a lot of CGI. And some of it doesn't even look finished! Some sequences looked like video game cutscenes at best, and at points I had to take off my 3D glasses because I had no idea what was happening. Note to self: Never see a 3D film again.However, all things must come to an end, and in this film, there are so many cases that are left unsolved, almost to the point where it baffled me. We're introduced to Thorin's cousin, DaÃ­n Ironfoot, who I'm pretty sure is a CGI version of Billy Connolly. Suddenly, he's gone, and we're left wondering where he went, and we never see what happens to them again. Same thing happens to Beorn, Tauriel, Bard, and *sigh* Alfrid, just to mention a few.That's this film's main problem; It opened too many doors without shutting them. Does that analogy make sense? There's almost no resolution to any of the characters except for Bilbo, masterfully portrayed by Martin Freeman, by the way. For a film series called The Hobbit, he doesn't appear nearly enough. I'm looking at you, Tauriel! Get out of the frame!In conclusion, this is a worthy final installment in The Hobbit Trilogy, and a film I consider to be the best of the three.Pros: Great acting, well-directed battle sequences, Howard Shore (Need I say more?), good visuals.Cons: Lack of resolutions, obnoxious characters, too much CGI, some cheesy moments.All in all a fine holiday film. If you enjoyed the previous Hobbits, you'll like this one.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Thorin becomes Smaug vs. Galadriel, the Action Hero","This entry of the Jackson Tolkien Films is the most difficult to get a handle on. Mostly because the events depicted only filled a few chapters in ""The Hobbit"". But what most people forget, is that these events are meticulously revisited in the Appendices of ""Lord of the Rings"" and there are more to these events than in JRR's first Middle Earth novel.For one thing, Gandalf joins a ""Council of White Wizards"" mentioned in the last chapters of The Hobbit, which confronted ""The Necromancer"" and drove him out of Dol Guldur. Saruman is not named as one of these, but those events are also in the Appendices of Lord of The Rings. Which is where it speaks of Saruman telling Gandalf the lie that The One Ring had rolled down the River Anduin into the Ocean, Saruman in fact had been looking for it for a while, but Bilbo's unexpected possession of it put a kink in his plans for it.This ""Council of White Wizards"" is shown early on in the Film, and in this treatment, includes Gandalf, Radagast, Galadriel, Elron and Saruman- Who had all come to the aid of Gandalf. This is where Galadriel ""Adamanty"" drives ""The Necromancer"" from Mirkwood- At first I thought using only ""Nenya"", the ""Ring of Adamant"", but after repeated viewings, she is definitely also holding the Light of Earendil, which as you remember, she gave to Frodo in ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". Here, she is shown with all of the potential dark power needed to perform an ejection of Sauron, protected by that light just as Frodo and Sam were in Shelob's Lair. I wonder if Galadriel's Wrath can be viewed as the same as Burt Lancaster, armed with a Machine Gun, shooting down Japanese planes in ""From Here to Eterenity""? Both show each character digging into their inner selves, pulling out power from deep within. Whether this power comes from a Machine Gun or ""Nenya"", one of the Three Elven Rings, is inconsequential. Both have the power, but it is the person who must choose to use these as weapons. Both scenes show each character differently than they normally are.In the extended version of ""Desolation of Smaug"" it is shown that Gandalf has found Thorin's Father Thrain in Dol Guldur. This also is recollected in The Appendices, with the fact that he had the last Dwarf Ring.So the question is, how do you tell a good story out of the few remaining chapters of the book? You do it by mining all of the facts out of the Lord of the Rings Appendices that relate to this time and side-load them into your story. The actual ""Battle of the Five Armies"" is not experienced from the reader's POV in The Hobbit, it is told after the fact. But here, all of the things that led up to it can be shown.The only real added thing was Jackson's Addition of the She-Elf ""Tauriel"" (Evangeline Lilly), who I had already said was pleasant to look at, especially when she lights up like Arwen while healing Kili (she even uses the same words that Arwin had used over Frodo), the whole thing with the added character and a kind of romantic thing with Kili does not deter me from enjoying this one bit. We know that Legolas and Gimli found an unbreakable connexion, not just in the Lord of the Rings Films but in the books as well, in fact they take the very last Ship into the West. Would JRR Roll in his grave? Maybe, maybe not, if he understood how movies are made. I have to question, would a treatment of The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, done page by page and scene by scene from the books, be any better? Consider that in Lord of The Rings, one story is told, then it backs up and tells another story that happened at the same time. In a book, that might make those events easier to follow, but in a film, to show them all happening at once is better. They did much the same thing with the film version of ""Cloud Atlas"", where are the book follows a character or set of characters and the film follows the timeline instead.So Legolas and Tauriel take a side trip to Gundabag? Maybe the book does not have those characters doing that, but we do know that Gundabag and Angmar were part of this story and with Lord of the Rings years later.But the part of this film I love is the depiction of The Madness of Thorin, who, after Smaug is killed, takes on his personality, even repeating phrases Smaug used. What will it take to break through that madness? Thorin has to do it himself, but he has always had the Loyalty of the other 12 Dwarfs and Bilbo. In fact Bilbo almost breaks through when Thorin approaches Bilbo as he is looking at his acorn, and Thorin believes Bilbo is looking at the Arkrnstone (Thorin was actually correct, but Bilbo has quick hands). When Thorin realizes that Bilbo will go through this much trouble to bring a humble acorn back to bag end, it almost shakes him back to normality. But then of course the conversation is interrupted by one of the other dwarfs with news of the men of Laketown taking up residency in the ruins of Dale.The Highlight of course is Billy Connolly as Dain, asking very politely if a an army of Men and Elves would Sod Off, Before being attacked by Creatures that seemed to have come from ""Arrakis"" in Frank Herbert's Universe.The Blending of CGI with Live Action and Miniatures is mind boggling. THIS is where Jackson Excels.If ""The Silmarillon"" could be made into a film or set of films, would Jackson do it? Moreover should he do it? I think so, if only to create a continuity of look and feel of Middle earth. New Zealand really is Middle Earth on Earth. Of course, I may add more when the Extended cut comes out. This film was in fact much too short. Finally, I want to add a hearty middle earth ""finger"" to all of the trolls who are downvoting every positive review.In fact, with Amazons ""rings of power"" series, the appendices are being opened up again, and although Peter Jackson is neither producing or directing it, several of the people who worked on his films are working on that new series, including casting directors, stuntmen, even some computer animators. And once again New Zealand becomes middle earth.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I owe Peter Jackson an apology,"My take on Peter Jackson is that he is an adolescent horror film maker, and that he thinks his audience is so stupid that they can't understand the good guys are in trouble unless he puts them in so deep they cannot get out without some kind of deus ex machina. That's why his ""King Kong"" is so bad. I have reconciled myself to his Lord of the Rings trilogy by thinking of it as PETER JACKSON's Lord of the Rings, and after all he put into it, he has the right to rewrite as he pleases.The second installment of The Hobbit is painful, 'WAY too long, with many, many more contrived battle scenes than anybody needs, especially since the only battle in the book is with the spiders. The rest never happened, so to speak.I did not go to the theater today expecting much. I left with a headache from crying.I owe Peter Jackson an apology.Yes, he changed things. Yes, his changes were unnecessary. But some of them are so good, I actually think I prefer his version to Tolkien's in places. I will not go into details, I will include no spoilers. Surely everyone knows he found a way to include Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and he created an elf-maid-warrior Tauriel (the luminous Evangeline Lilly). Furthermore, I believe everyone knows he contrived an unlikely romance between Tauriel and the dwarf Kili (Aidan Turner, who is almost as pretty as Ms. Lilly). Did you know he made the romance work cinematically? Watch for it. (They who have read the novel knows Kili does not make it out alive. Have a hanky ready) The additions, Gandalf's encounter with The Necromancer, and walk-ons by Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), Saruman (Christopher Lee), and Elrond (Hugo Weaving) is no secret either. Tolkien never fleshes out the story, so if Peter Jackson elects to portray it, good on him! He did good.Oh, and I don't read all the pre-release stuff. When I recognized the voice of Billy Connolly as Dain, I was delighted! He is a wonderful addition! My opinion: this is the best of the trilogy by far. I may prefer it to the any of the original trilogy!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A satisfying conclusion to The Hobbit trilogy.,"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies continues with the story of Bilbo Baggins(Martin Freeman). After the events of the previous film, the dragon Smaug(Benedict Cumberbatch) wreaks havoc on Lake Town. Thorin Oakenshield(Richard Armitage) and the rest of the dwarfs reclaim Erebor. There is a lot of gold in Erebor. The people of Lake Town, led by Bard(Luke Evans), demand to get their share of gold as promised to them by Thorin & due to the damage done to Lake Town. The elves led by Thranduil(Lee Pace), also claim some treasure that belongs to them. Now, it is up to Thorin, to either comply with their requests or to wage a war against the humans, the elves & the Orcs led by Azog(Manu Bennett).The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is a mind blowing movie! The opening sequence involving Smaug destroying Lake Town is tense & thrilling & looks even better in 3D. The battle sequences towards the end of the film have been beautifully choreographed & the 3D has also been put to good use during this major war. The locales are beautiful. New Zealand has been portrayed magnificently in the Middle Earth movies. However, I liked The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug(2013) better. I consider that film to be the best of the trilogy. Though The Battle of the Five Armies is a close second, it got slightly dull in the middle. I also didn't like the fact that Martin Freeman's role was substantially reduced in this movie, compared to the previous two movies. Martin Freeman is outstanding as Bilbo Baggins. Ian McKellen is brilliant as Gandalf. Richard Armitage is spectacular as Thorin Oakenshield. Benedict Cumberbatch is terrifying as Smaug/Necromancer. Luke Evans is great as Bard. Evangeline Lilly is amazing as Tauriel. Lee Pace is mind blowing as Thranduil. Orlando Bloom is awesome as Legolas. Aidan Turner & Dean O'Gorman are good as Kili & Fili respectively. Cate Blanchett is impressive as Galadriel. Manu Bennett is menacing as Azog. The supporting characters are impressive as well. The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is a must watch for all The Lord of the Rings & The Hobbit fans.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great movie! Great way to end the series!,"I got to see The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies at the Los Angeles premiere December 9, 2014. I was hesitant to be enthusiastic about this film because I couldn't see how the ending of the Hobbit could be done well. I shouldn't have doubted Peter Jackson and company. From the opening scene, I was completely enchanted and mesmerized. I was taken into the story and laughed and cried along the way. Some of the scenes in TBoTFA are the best I've ever seen. One in particular featuring Galladriel gave me such chills that I can't wait to see it again. Anyone who has read the Hobbit and/or the Appendices to the Lord of the Rings or who has seen the first two movies should come away loving this one and feeling completely satisfied if sad. #OneLastTime",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"All 'battle' and little else, as the title suggests.","Hobbit 3. The last time we revisit Middle Earth and all its merry folk. So how amazing was this final venture? Not very.The movie starts well, with Smaug the Fiery Dragon. Smaug was the best thing about the preceding movie, and he sure does liven up the beginning of this one. This fire breathing dragon gave me the chills, as ironical as that may seem.Now, enter good ol' Azog. Azog the fair skinned, ambitious young lad, always frustrated and miffed off at everybody. Azog the Defiler never actually seemed a scary enough villain to me, just very mean. His character was considerably one-sided and Azog had this weird habit of stressing on every word he says, like a growling five year old. So, a vile, ferocious monster, with no depth whatsoever, is just that.And I'd also like to mention the Mighty Gundabad Orcs, that are apparently very strong and fearsome, because anytime any character mentions them, they widen their eyes and take a deep breath. So, when all the characters convinced me of how terrible Gunadabad Orcs were going to be, it was considerable vibe-kill to see Bilbo throw fist sized stones from afar at the Orcs, to which they were knocked out cold, in an almost comical way. One would expect more from the much lauded Gundabad Orcs.And that brings us to Bilbo, i.e; Martin Freeman. Freeman's comical prowess is undisputed of course, but this role actually required him to bring some more dramatic meat to the screen. I found Bilbo being too laid-back for much of the movie, cracking witty jokes time and time again, which while having been entertaining, undermined the seriousness of the moment.And Gandalf? Never before has he done so little in a movie, at one point he himself says something along the lines of ""Since when has my counsel counted for so little?!"" He was speaking the truth. That isn't necessarily a problem, but along with other characters that are similarly thrown in, but have little to actually do, brings a feeling of vagueness to proceedings. Special mention would also go to the Elf-Goblin romance that was shallow and forced.The story is simple. People, elfs, goblins and orcs fight very hard and for a very long time. Its a two half hour sequence of battle scene after battle scene between every possible creature you and I can imagine. But to be fair, the title does warn us very clearly. So, we can't actually complain too much on that front, but I believe we can say that there could've been more narrative depth and coherence to the script.It has now come to my notice, that I've mentioned far too many cons and not enough pros. There are some really swell moments in the film. The background score for the movie complements the battle sequences very well. The battle sequences themselves were well done, if not legendary. And Thorin Oakenshield. He was the crowning glory of this movie. As much as it claims to be The 'Hobbit' 3, I felt that this installment was a lot more focused on the life and times of Thorin Oakenshield. Richard Armitage gave every scene his all, and added much dramatic depth to the story. Where Bilbo was comical, Thorin was intense.All in all, the greatest fallacy of this movie, is quite simply it's lineage; in the sense that it is inevitably compared with the legendary Lord of the Rings trilogy, which can never be bettered. The comparison with the preceding movies is what works most against it, but these comparisons are very much valid. Still, The Hobbit: Battle Of The Five Armies in all its visual brilliance, auditory resonance, and good performances, manages to make us feel epic along with all our Elf and Goblin kin, who fight valiantly.Thank you Peter Jackson. And thank you, JRR Tolkien.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Spellbinding!,"The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien is an iconic storyline about the struggle between good and evil, complete with all of the drama and pageantry surrounding the attacks by Smaug and the final Battle. Good clearly defined against evil, just as Tolkien wrote it. While the film was somewhat ""heavy-handed"" with the use of CGI, there is no doubt that it was a required necessity. For those who would dispute the need, I challenge you to show me an orc army ready for filming which would not require hours daily in make-up for hundreds. Even though this has been done for many films, and it is possible to expand the number of people ""seen"" with electronic technology, it inevitably comes out looking like computer expansion. All in all, an excellent job.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Superb cinematography (3D HFR) with decent story,"This review is meant to help people decide whether its worth their time and money to watch this movie or not.Overall feel? I have read Hobbit and story deviations didn't bother me at all (not a die hard fan). I am usually annoyed by plot/character inconsistencies and those weren't issue either. Mostly movie was in action type setting, but had emotional conflicts and bit of romance, some funny bits and my favorite parts: that nice gray wizard trying to light up his pipe. You won't find deep philosophical knowledge here but there are moments for reflection. Its strongest point is definitely visuals and if you are not into it and didn't like story/characters from previous Hobbit movies this probably won't be better.Visuals? Oh gawd they were good (HFR at least). For me it seemed very realistic although still sometimes disorientating and lacking in realistic physics. I enjoyed HFR of previous movies and thought it was even better in this one. I'm speculating that having screen covering larger portion of your field of vision might be better (as effects are cutoff outside screen). The whole experience might have been worth just because of visuals.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The best of the bunch but I'm looking forward to the next instalment,"Possibly perversely I enjoyed this instalment - but is that only because it's probably the last? I've more or less enjoyed all of Peter Jackson's extremely condensed Tolkien heavily-edited interpretations, usually less and none of them have inspired me to read the books. All of the films kept a lot of people in work, creative people and the banks happy and audiences mesmerised so in a sense it's a shame it has to end â€“ couldn't they squeeze a quadrilogy of The Simarillion to keep the gravy train rolling?It opens with a fiery flying monster getting his violent come-uppance amidst relentless carnage above Lake-town; then the title. I thought Smaug the magic dragon was a fantastic character, gone too soon. Then began the main carnage with a mix of rumbustious racism and feeble posturing from a motley assemblage of concrete stereotypes (the most glaring still being that perceived Ugliness equals Evil and so-called Betters have Brains). But if War Is Hell no one in here was to blame - the hundreds of men women and children who got themselves slaughtered in this film may have been consoled by that thought but I wasn't. I tend to mentally switch off during modern cgi cartoonery battle sequences but I would've missed most of this film if I had; and apparently it took up only one chapter of the original book. As with the five other films I wondered idly about the ancient hordes of workers, peasants and slaves that would have been required to build such mammoth cities and buildings â€“ no one in the current Middle Earth seemed to be involved in creating anything, even food or clothes. As politicians and terrorists have always found it's easier to destroy than create, so film-makers always find viewers are more entranced by destruction (as a form of creation) than construction. It was nice to see oldÃ« Christopher Lee kicking such violent ass, strange to glimpse giant worms used merely as plot-device escapees from Dune, weird to wonder of the true significance of the Arkenstone in the book as there was none in the film. However, it's a film of tremendous imagination and scope, small plot holes and non sequiturs are entirely understandable and forgivable.Too many damn people died in here for me to care about any of the important characters who croaked, although even I would have been surprised if the littlest hobo hero had met his doom too. Overall, I'm still determined to never read the books but all being well I'll spend a week on a LOTR&H Fest sometime, with Part 7 being a night of silence - it might just make more sense to me if seen with the others in context, and before I've a chance to forget all that went before. We shall not see its like again, hopefully: the poignant end credit marathon sings it all.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Excellent Movie....If you get LOTR off your head!,"LOTRs are my favorite movies..I could watch them thousands of times and never get bored, and I thought the same would happen with THE HOBBIT. That was my first mistake. I just want everyone to know, if you walk in the cinema, expecting this movie to get anywhere near the greatness of the LOTR you will feel completely disappointed. I'm not saying it's a bad film, but you have to try to erase LOTR of your memory for a few hours if you really want to enjoy this one, because it's a really good movie.But, why couldn't I get the same feeling in this one as the LOTR? Maybe there was too much comedy? Maybe the romance? Perhaps excessive CGI that kept reminding me it was a movie? I don't know...I just hope me writing this will help some people enjoy the movie!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The greatest and most magic of the journeys.,"It is with a mixture of anticipation and sadness that I will watch this middle earth (including LOTR) journey come to and end. However thank you Mr Jackson for evoking memories of a 9 yr old back in '69 listening to her English Teacher read the Hobbit when heard Golems voice on screen. Thank you for taking us all away from the constant doom and gloom of the current state of the world and allowing us into waorld where Good always triumps over Evil and where heroism, friendship, and contributing to a cuase bigger than ourselves, still means something. I can appreciate that artistically Peter Jackson may wish to explore other paths but I hope that one day that he will want to retun to making another mythical epic to cheer our hearts one day.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I never cared,"Watching Lord of the Rings I cared about the hobbits and the companions. Here I never cared about the dozen guys in Halloween costumes or the dwarf who looked like a human leading man but lacked the charisma of Aragorn or the hobbit who looked like a human and lacked the charisma of Frodo.The movie was actually better than I remembered though I did fast forward through some of the worst of the CGI. Bard was almost interesting and the first hour felt like a movie generally. At some point it became a montage of video game cuts scenes until say the last 20 minutes. When compared to Lord of the Rings, it is amazing to think that the same creative team was behind it. I get the sense that much like Lucas, Jackson got lucky once and never will be able to come close to his masterwork.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great,"This is without a doubt the best of the hobbit movies, and while its still not as good as any of the LOTR movies, its not far behind. The criticism against these movies are mainly from people expecting a new LOTR trilogy, which is unreasonable considering the hobbit being a much smaller and child-friendly book. Peter Jackson has really made the best out of the material from the book, and having read the book i cant really see how it could have been done any better. There's probably more happening in this third movie than in the two previous combined, and the dragon and war scenes are some of the highlights of the movie. Its also the funniest of all the middle-earth movies, with the obnoxious character Alfrid providing a lot of funny moments throughout the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
HFR terrible. Movie terrible.,"Just got back from the theater. Saw it in HFR 3D. The HFR experience was terrible, terrible. It looked like TV. It's a bad excuse to say it will look like real life and it's better. The more natural it looks the worse it is. I don't want to watch it like it's TV news. We want to watch a movie and not real life. 24fps has the dream, fantasy feel. I will avoid all HFR films and I see no future for it.Now, the movie. The movie was real bad. I give it 6/10 and I'm probably too generous. This was easily the worst of the Hobbit trilogy.It was a big mistake to take the Smaug resolution and put in movie 3. It belonged in movie 2 and it all felt wrong here.The rest was also terrible because there is no story at all here. It's just a battle and a battle not done well like LOTR trilogy.

an appropriate end,"This will be a short commentary to make it simple for you; no matter what other says, it'd be 'hard' to make it from the story of a film that is so simple; and P.J. was managed it adroitly. 'Hobbit' was totally a shortly written book for children, but scenario from the book was not 'exaggerated' in any episodes. Before criticizing, think about it; there is no more movie that could be compared with P.J. series.But of course, to be honestly, there are two negative elements in my mind about the series; 1. not meeting the great expectations (this comment is for 'Desolation of Smaug' only) 2. end of the middle earth (end of epic fantasy). If we're talking for last episode only, without doubt, it would be unfair to pass the praise of fight scenes - especially Elrond and Saruman's vs nine kings - it was totally an upgrade, even for P.J. As in the first film - i can not say it for the second one - the soul of middle earth could be felt all throughout the film.Finally without comprising with LOTR, this movie end all this series were undoubtedly have taken its place in the history of cinema..",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
great finale,"So legit, a great conclusion to a fantastic series. The third installment starts off, right where the second ends. If you are into just straight-up epic fantasy battles, then this is the movie for you. My only complaint is that I wish they would have given Gandoff more swag, and had him use his ""magic"" more.The battle scenes were nothing short of awesomesauce. There really isn't a lot of plot development or twists, just because the first two do such a great job setting up this last picture. Also the ""social commentary"" on how greed is such a powerful destroyer, and ""the root of all evil."" Like CS Lewis, it's an allegory for inner human struggles and simply good vs evil.#toteslegit",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A wonderful transition from The Hobbit to The Lord of the Rings,"The Hobbit trilogy has overall been a really fun and exciting set of films but the major flaw has been that for the most part they can't stand on their own. They always feel like one film in a trilogy but now that the trilogy is complete, I can honestly say that it's the best looking, most colorful, best produced trilogy of films I have ever seen. It's amazing how well they take a small children's story and make it into an incredible, epic trilogy.A complaint with the previous two films was too much filler, it is clear in this film that Peter Jackson has only included the more valuable scenes for the story (except for a certain master's deputy.)Each scene in some way contributes to the story.When I went into this movie I expected two things; an end to a trilogy and also a transition from one trilogy to another. I can envision people in the future to watch the two trilogies back to back. Then the story will be completely fluent and jointed.On the whole the production value is the highest I think I have ever seen, incredibly good effects, great looking CG and on the whole on of the biggest movies I have ever seen in my life.The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is not a good movie if you have not recently seen the movies that came before it. But as a part of a trilogy it is most certainly worth at least a watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Battle of Five Armies : Not A Single Movie,"If the Rings was a legendary and unbelievable trilogy of all times, then the Hobbit would a great and enjoyable trilogy that still satisfied the audience. The novel was written in the similar way. While the Rings requires more time commitment and vocabularies to read through, the Hobbit is more geared toward a younger audience (children and teens).If I review the The Battle of the Five Armies as a single movie, I will point out a lot of flaws. The first would be the pace of the movie. For example, in the beginning of movie, Bard vs Smaug was way too fast. Peter Jackson gave Smaug an infinite amount of armor but a non-existent hitting points. From there, we can tell the second flaw of the movie - too much distortion in the fighting scene. The Orcs can only attack but has no defense ability. The Dwarfs suddenly have the fighting ability as Elves. And this leads to its third vital flaw - the fast change of character. I like how the Elf King and Tauriel changed in the end. However, how Thorin changed his mind was too suddenly that the audience would feel something was missing.If I review the The Battle of the Five Armies as a conclusion of the Hobbit trilogy, these flaws I pointed out would make more sense and may not be viewed as flaws anymore. The movie created a suspense that was not really exited in the book. Without carrying away the main theme of this movie, The director has to limit the emphasis on Bard's fight with Smaug. The same goes with the change in Thorin. The director wants the five armies share the same development. It was a trade-off between showing Thorin thinking and arguing against himself alone for 10 minutes and developing the massive grand fight for 10 minutes. I would not blame the director to choosing the latter.Lastly, the unrealistic fighting scene in the movie does not make the movie unreal. In my opinion, the ending in this trilogy was far more sorrow and realistic than the ending in Rings. Tauriel asked the Elf King why things ended this way, he provided a simple answer ""because it was real."" If an explanation is needed for all unrealistic scenes in the movie, we can find one before the very end. When Gandalf bade farewell to Bilbo, Gandalf said the fundamental of the whole trilogy ""you don't really suppose that all your adventures were managed merely by luck, do you?""",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best of the 3,"I was pleased with everything Peter Jackson created in this last installment. During the first two movies I was having issues with all the things that were not like the book, especially adding new characters and relationships - but the drama, action and the essential thread of the story was so well created and acted out in this installment that I was able to put all my issues aside and enjoy the ride and all of the characters. It was actually fun to see scenes that did not happen in the book, which helped bring the story full circle into the Lord of the Rings Trilogy filmed a decade earlier. One of the big character changes in all of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies is that the writers always add more female characters. It's a smart move, even though at first I objected to there being a Tauriel elf girl and Legolas present as the son of Thranduil in this version of the Hobbit. It's also great to see the casting people use New Zealand actors in each movie, since that is where the filming happened. It was really fun to see the return of characters from the first 3 movies in this last Hobbit movie, even if they may not all have actually appeared on the pages of the book. I am ready to go see the movie again to pick up on details I missed, including the fact that a familiar actor I watch on the Arrow t.v. series played the leader of the Orc army, Azog. He was totally CGI of course, but now I will be looking for the actor, Manu Bennett, in the CGI version of him, like I was watching for Andy Serkis in the Gollum character from the first movies. I also want to rewatch for the signs of the return of dark times in Mordor in relation to Bilbo's finding and use of the ring. I hope Peter Jackson is able to keep making movies of this caliber. The passion and detail of his work as director, writer, creater of other worlds is quite a gift to all of us.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The worst aspects of modern blockbuster filmmaking,"If you ever wondered what a Lord of the Rings film would be looked like if directed by Michael Bay then The Battle of the Five Armies is the closest we are ever going to get. The Battle of the Five Armies was when the The Hobbit Trilogy fell apart. It was a last minute decision by the studio to turn The Hobbit from a two-parter into a trilogy and make turn five pages into a two and a half long film. Like any battle films, i.e. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2, Battle of the Five Armies was just relentless action.The film started off well enough with Smaug attacking Lake Town but it fell into fan-fiction territory. The film brought in Elrond, Saurman, and Galadriel to save Gandalf, have fan-service moments involving Legolas, and the reference to Aragon at the end.Whilst Lord of the Rings was high fantasy, there was a certain level of realism with the battle scenes. The original trilogy used a mixture of effects. The final The Hobbit film was too dependent on CGI effects and many things were over-designed like the Trolls with artificial limbs, Trolls with catapults, and dwarves riding on mountain goats. Billy Connolly looked like he was from a video game.One of the worst features of the film to me was the role of Legolas. Because of his role in LotR there was no fear of peril for the character and he seemed to do more superhuman feats in this film than in any of the previous ones.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The best of the Hobbit movie,"This is not a bad movie. I am surprised that it received worse reviews than the first two Hobbit films. This sequel most clearly demonstrates the connections which exist between the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings franchises. It does not have as many lulling periods as the second movie. It is action-packed and fun, and it has very few dull moments. It is probably the best movie of the year, although that may not be saying that much. James Berardinelli was astute for giving the movie 3.5/4 stars and deeming it the best of the Hobbit movies.Although the Lord of the Rings franchise is over, the movie nevertheless says much about Peter Jackson's future. Hopefully, he will direct more movies that are action-packed like King Kong. Except for The Frighteners, many of his pre-Lord of the Rings movies were rather campy. Similarly, I was disappointed with the Lovely Bones.P.S. One perception I've had about his Hobbit movies is that they have more of a stale Harry Potter feel. I do not consider that a bad thing; he probably needed more variety in his franchise. Unlike some others, I was not annoyed by the CGI; perhaps the filmmakers were trying to save money.9/10",,Anonymous,Fantasy
There and back again,"I was dubious heading in to the cinema to see this, I just couldn't see how this last segment of the book could fill a 2 hour film. It started off right where it needed to and Smaug flying over the town looked spectacular. Nice to see Christopher Lee too, even if it was his face superimposed! The battle scenes were epic and the cinematography during these scenes was perfect. There are still a few elements I'm not sure have been depicted as in the book and the battle certainly filled up screen time where there was no dialogue. Overall it was enjoyable and I felt the same as I did when I got to the end of RotK in that I was wanting more as you do feel like you have been on a journey yourself with these films, but my opinion has not changed that they could have made two really good epic films without any filler, or Orlando Bloom.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hobbit:  Battle of the Five Armies Review,"The journey of Bilbo Baggins and Thorin's company of 13 dwarfs was always destined to end one way: all out war. In their struggles, these 14 characters managed to cross paths with goblins, orcs, eagles, wood elves, and men. Inevitably, once Smaug is dealt with, they would all converge on Erebor to split up the dragon's treasure, and their bickering would escalate into the Battle of the Five Armies.With most of the journey completed up to this point, the film's sole purpose is the climax: there is no rising action or build-up, the film jumps right into showing Smaug decimating Laketown, the White Council confronting the Necromancer, and five different armies breaking out in all-out combat. In spite of this, the film is easily the most action-packed and evenly-paced movie of the entire saga. There is tons of action and visual splendor, from the decimation of an entire town to the showdown between iconic characters in an ancient snow-covered ruin. The film is always shifting gears from one huge setpiece to another, as the battle constantly changes and new foes erupt to take the film in exciting new directions. The film is the shortest of all Middle Earth films, but its sheer amount of action makes it feel longer, more epic, and more breakneck than the others.Where the film falls short, unfortunately, is the storytelling. Truth is, most of the burden of the storytelling was left to the last two films, so there's little left but to have all the characters fight. The film is at its best as it shows Thorin's madness from ""dragon sickness"" (or rather, unbridled greed), Bilbo's intervention in the brewing conflict, Bard's efforts to lead others and protect his family, and the occasional burst of drama involving Turiel and Legolas (although both could have been cut from this whole series without much impact). Once the battle's over, however, there are loose ends that the film only partially addresses. It does round off a few characters and make connections to The Lord of the Rings, but then it leaves other strands hanging, or just cuts them off. Even though having ""many endings"" like Return of the King would have strained some viewers' patience, I would have personally appreciated at least a little more dialogue or scenes to explain what happens to the folk of Laketown, the wood elves, Tauriel, Dain, Beorn, Radagast, and other characters introduced for The Hobbit specifically. Overall, this only feels like half a movie. It's the half of a movie that should have been tacked onto the end of The Desolation of Smaug. On its own, it's a rather flat and shallow storyline. In the larger context of the whole Hobbit saga, it generally works and it is a thrilling endgame, but a few more words concerning the characters and events would have made this a stronger ending, and maybe even a more powerful film.Fortunately, the film looks as good as the rest, with good, sweeping photography and concise editing. Acting is still strong from the whole cast, with Martin Freeman and Richard Armitage being the biggest standouts among the veterans of the series. Writing is still great. This production has great-looking sets, props, costumes, locales, and special effects. The music score is pretty decent too.The film is definitely jam-packed with all the great fantasy-action we've always loved to see in the Middle Earth saga, but once studios made the decision to stretch The Hobbit into three films, there was little choice but to cleave off the climax and turn it into this odd standalone feature. On its own, it's rather dry, but with the other movies, it's a must-see. My only wish is that there could have been a longer and more pronounced farewell to all the players involved with the whole affair.4.5/5 (Experience: Perfect | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Perfect)",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Excellent,"I have just recently watched The Hobbit The Incredible Journey and decided to jump straight in and watch The Battle of Five Armies and I wasn't disappointed. This film has everything for me, Adventure....Action....Despair....Humour and Jaw Dropping Special Effects. It would be easy for me to give Peter Jackson a big pat on the back for this movie. After all, he was also responsible for the Lord of the Ring movies. But I think he would be the first to acknowledge that movies of this magnitude can not be credited to one man. This is a well made movie with some big performances, none more so than Martin Freeman in the title role, who I don't mind saying had a lump in my throat on more than one occasion. If you look hard enough, you can probably find faults with any movie. As for me on this occasion, I just sat back enjoyed the ride.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best of the 3 Hobbit movies,"In perfect fashion with the original trilogy this third and final installment of The Hobbit is the best one, BUT it comes no where near the original trilogy, this third movie is one big battle, it does however not seem too long like some reviewers suggest.It is also a bit funny to see the heavy use of CGI in comparison to the original trilogy, I have a eerie feeling that this one is going to be less enjoyable on BluRay as you can easily see the CGI.But do not be mistaken, it is still a masterpiece and a worthy end to the trilogy about Bilbo, and it is not lacking shocking deaths and Geladriel has one of if not the best scene of all 6 movies.Oh and I am really happy to see what really went on before Frodo.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
NOTE:You may heavily disagree with me on this,"I personally really enjoyed this film. The story itself was lacking, to say the least with the romance and drama element failing miserably,but Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee and Richard Armitage all trying to make the conclusion to the Middle-Earth Saga as epic as possible was a plus. But I knew this was going to be more underdeveloped than the others with it being predominantly about the Battle of the five armies, and this is honestly a good popcorn flick with the battle being enjoyable to say the least.On the whole, this movie was quite a good send off to the middle-earth saga, despite it being one of the weaker films along with An Unexpected Journey, but Peter Jackson has made a better prequel trilogy than George Lucas and I was impressed by the action and Freeman's performance. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Fair Farewell.,"The Hobbit 3 Battle of The Five Armies. Did not live up to the hype to the war, but lives up to being a fair farewell to a Classic which is The Hobbit Trilogy. Despite Peter Jackson's adaptation of the battle, was a total MESS of CGI ruins! The battle itself, just makes you cringe. Following somewhat of George Lucas with his adaptation of CGI clones in The Star Wars prequels. Peter Jackson's fails in his adaptation of the final war with morbid CGI effects. Where he was GREATLY successful with adapting wars on the big screen, from Lord of The Rings The Two Towers or Lord of The Rings The Return of The King. Peter Jackson created some of the greatest war scenes ever in films! But with The Battle of The Five Armies was TRAGIC! But there is a plus? The battle between Thorin vs Azog was a great battle! Peters Jackson's adaptation of CGI in Hobbit 1,2 was good. Except for the 3rd installment. The CGI Battle of The Five Armies war was like an installed toilet, for the trilogy.But overall it takes manure to make fertilizer.The Hobbit 3 is overall an entertaining film and should I say classic? Anyways Luke Evans as Bard really comes through in this film, as a man of heroics! A feel of how Aragorn came through in The Lord of The Rings. As for The Great and Terrible SMAUG. The long year wait to see SMAUG destroy Laketown, comes to a very fast halt, with his sudden death. Yet. SMAUG played a key role in this film and within minutes, he is dead. So much for the layover from the 2nd, to the 3rd. The long wait. Then pfff he is outta here!Anyways. It was an entertaining scene. Really the best part of the film is when Bart kills the dragon.Overall The Hobbit 3 is an entertaining film. The Hobbit Trilogy concludes into being a Classic! A fair farewell.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This Movie is plotless,"Poor writing, dull action scenes, unappealing characters is how I describe this film. It's just not a good movie. The Hobbit trilogy isn't a very good one in my opinion. The first two are okay, but this third one was kind of horrible.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The End of a Journey,"To set the scene, Smaug has been awoken and has Lake Town firmly in his sights. Whilst he char grills the town, the dwarfs watch on anxiously, with Bilbo's final, desperate monologue of ""What have we done?"" from The Desolation of Smaug becoming a visible nightmare. The Dragon is dealt with and all eyes turn to the mountain. The Dwarfs, led by Thorin, seek to hold onto their newly claimed home, yet every man and his proverbial dog, horse, warg, ludicrous Elk (King Thranduil), or even more ridiculous Pig (King Dain) want a share of the gold. Thus tensions bubble up to explosion on the battlefield as Men, Dwarfs and Elves take on the Orc and Warg ridden armies of Sauron.As we can expect, the action scenes are sprawling and magnificent to behold, but it is much more than a bombastic war movie, and here's where I think the strengths lie. The power of Jackson is that amidst the whole scale destruction there is always a humanity present, a sense of helplessness and the feeling that the stories are more to do with character arcs and development than just meaningless blood-shed. We all love the action scenes, and they're the ones we wax lyrical about when we come out of the cinema, yet in this film in particular, the anchor to the plot is the story of Thorin. Richard Armitage simply plays a blinder in this film, stealing the lime light from the once again excellent Bilbo and the thoroughly impressive Bard. This is an arc within a arc; the descent into madness then the redemption of a dwarf who will not fall to the same dragon sickness as his grandfather. But this isn't some hammy Shakespearean actor reeling off their best Richard III impression, this is much more persuasive and powerful stuff.Further positives include the desolation of Smaug in full force. Cumberbatch's serpentine tones leave you transfixed and wanting more. Indeed, it's a shame that he's dispatched so quickly, yet the reality is that there wasn't any way that they could have conceivably stretched it out anymore, so it becomes a hollow criticism. As I mentioned, Bard is brilliant as the reluctant King of Lake Town and the arrival of King Dain â€“ a ridiculously CGI-ed Billy Connolly â€“ offers genuine comedic rest bite from what can be a pretty grim two and a half hours.On the point of CGI, here's where my gripes start. The tone of the film is meant to be different to LOTR, this I appreciate; the source material is lighter so it makes sense to make the baddies more mythic. But I think that this tonal shift at times undercuts the peril of the action. For example, Bard gets a pretty epic, legolas-worthy spate of badassery where he kills a troll, yet the Troll looks more like Wayne Rooney than a terrifying creature meant to strike fear into your hearts. Moreover I think that the decision to make Azog and Bolg mo-capped as opposed to genuine physical presences undermines their on screen presence. The most visceral battle scenes, in my opinion, are in Dale when Bard leads the beleaguered men of the Lake against blokes dressed up as Orcs, not coming from an admittedly very impressive computer.A point of both praise and criticism is that the film seems acutely aware that it needs to give nods to, and in some ways emulate, LOTR. In some ways it's really good to see, such as the size of the battles and the cinematic deaths of some characters instantly creating a stylistic flashback to Boromir in the Fellowship. Finally Bard is a pseudo Aragorn in the sense that he is the reluctant leader of men. These are subtle cinematic nods. But I think the plot strands can be slightly shoe-horned in. For example, the forbidden love of Tauriel and Kili smacks of the relationship between Aragorn and Arwen. Also, the final dialogue between Thranduil and Legolas tries to create a tangible link between the trilogies, but just feels a bit forced.All of this aside, and I think that it is triumphant. Both characters old and new come together to create a rousing couple of hours of entertainment. The old band is given their curtain call â€“ Saruman, Galadriel, Elrond etc. Whilst the new characters deservedly become an appreciated part of the canon. Thranduil is chilling, Tauriel is moving (and I fell in love with her again), Bard is bold, the dwarfs are given more to say and Bilbo and Thorin steer the ship. It is imperfect, but every film is. When you put it amongst the other 5 films it doesn't stand out in a negative way, indeed the battle scenes rival the Return of the King in terms of scope. This is as shining an endorsement as any.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What we need next : Extended cuts and ULTIMATE CUTS,"On the HOBBIT BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES :Great movie, but the third movie (Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies) is way too short! Really, incredibly, too short! The resolutions are too abrupt and the ending is too quick. It misses some key scenes : one important funeral, reconstruction of Lake-Town with Bard as it's new master (or some kind of ending for Bard), Thranduil's white jewels, more Beorn and more White Council (which is a cameo really, not a payoff). It clearly needs more character-driven scenes. Ah and what about the Arkenstone?Also, Bilbo's departure from Erebor seemed cold and distant to me, as was the last scene between Gandalf and Bilbo.I hope the 35 minutes of extended scenes Peter Jackson promised will solve that (but even 35 minutes seem insufficient to me). Hope PJ will inject some of the ''multiple ending'' style from the Return of the King to Battle of the five Armies. We NEED to have proper endings for the main characters like Bard, Thranduil, Thorin, Balin (master of MORIA) and also for Saruman,Radagast, Gandalf etc.On LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY :We want to see those deleted scenes, unused for the Extended edition of LOTR, be put back into the movies, in the next Ultimate Edition :Fellowship of the Ring :additional footage from the Battle of the Last Alliance (and maybe add Lee Pace's Thranduil into it), an extended Council of Elrond (dialogue from the Council of Elrond, such as Gandalf explaining how Sauron forged the One Ring)The Two Towers : Arwen and Elrond visiting Galadriel at LothlÃ³rien, Conversation between Elrond and Arwen in a library in Rivendell, after Arwen decides to wait for Aragorn. Elrond leaves saying ""You gave away your life's grace. I cannot protect you anymore""Return of the King : further epilogue footage, with endings for Legolas and Gimli, Ã‰owyn and Faramir's wedding and Aragorn's death and funeral. Also, to give context for Wormtongue killing Saruman, and Legolas in turn killing Wormtongue, it was to be revealed Wormtongue poisoned ThÃ©odred. The final scene cut was Aragorn having his armour fitted for the Battle of the Black Gate by the trilogy's armourers, which was the final scene filmed during principal photography.Peter Jackson already have stated that he would like to include some of these unused scenes in a future ""Ultimate Edition"" home video release, also including out-takes. Also, he recently had a great idea, namely to put some of the Hobbit's characters into the LOTR, as he mentioned in this recent interview: "" I actually think the young girls are going to start watching this 1, 2, 3 and they're going to start wondering where Tauriel is. We're really three or four years away from eight and nine year-old discovering these movies and watching them in this order and will be wondering why she doesn't show up in ""Lord of the Rings."" Maybe we'll get Evangeline down to New Zealand, shoot a bunch of stuff, chop it up and put it into a box set. ""It would be great if he would be able to revisit the cut of all 6 movies in the near future, do an ""ultimate cut"" of the 6 movies and integrate those scenes I mentioned back in the movies (instead of bonuses or deleted scenes). Peter Jackson should also be able to re- shoot the ""Bilbo finding the Ring"" scene from Fellowship of the ring, remake Gollum from the shadowy scene from Fellowship, add more Balrog vs Gandalf fight, integrate Thranduil in the Battle of the Last Alliance, etc. Thanks!",,Anonymous,Fantasy
The End of the Beginning,"We may have seen one end of the story, but the story is far from over. For most of us Middle Earth fans, it's quite an adventure to see things from the eyes of a hobbit, but what does it look like from the eyes of the villain? Now that we have seen through one hobbit, it's time that we see from the rest of the story. These three movies set up for what is to come. We are told of ONE RING. We are told of the All-Seeing Eye that looks over Middle Earth ready to devour it. But there is something hidden in the darkness that is ready to pounce on its prey.On September 21, 1937, J.R.R. Tolkien penned the great novel that we see today portrayed in movie form. His intentions were of faith, belief, values and the Cross. Tolkien was a Roman Catholic â€“ he believed in right from wrong, death and life, good and evil. That is what he based his writings on. And that is what these movies portray. Not only was Tolkien a Christian but he converted his best friend, the author of The Chronicles of Narnia, C.S. Lewis. But that has nothing to do with this movie.At the helm of these great movies, the magic of Peter Jackson comes to life. Mr. Jackson has brought countless tales of hobbits, orcs, wizards and all creatures alike and also he brought a deity so terrible that even we crinch when we say his name, Sauron, better known to us as Satan. Every bit of these movies, every bit of the books has something to do with the Christian faith. But it doesn't stop there. Like the title says, the end of the beginning. Jesus said in Revelation 22:13, ""I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end."" So you see this movie, this story may have something to do with movie cinematography, production, and makeup, but ultimately The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings will stand the test of time, not only throughout the literature, but ultimately throughout our lives until we finally meet our Mithrandir, Jesus Christ.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Why did this movie feel so utterly half assed. Green screens!,"I was expecting so much more from these movies. They are not even close to what the other LOTR movies were. Its just the only feeling I had during all the three movies was ""these movies feels so rushed and somehow, not genuine"". Everything felt so empty, like it was thrown together and don't get me wrong, it was still better then most but not even close to the real deal. I never could shake the feeling that this was just thrown together and I think its a side effect of all the green screens and the over endulgment of the CGI. The Green screens that made Ian Mckellen cry because he couldn't act properly, the green screens that replaced EVERYTHING. I respect CGI and green screens but I don't know, the LOTR still tried to do as much as possible without CGI. In this movie, they were just lazy.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Very Pleasing Finale to an Outstanding Film Series,","The Hobbit: the Battle of the Five Armies is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic cast.Fans of the Hobbit trilogy and the overall Middle Earth franchise should be pleased with this finale,it wraps up Bilbo's journey and says goodbye to all these beloved characters in a very sweet and pleasing way.Admittedly, it wasn't the same emotional send off that Return of the King was,Peter Jackson really took his time writing and developing that ending but this one felt a little rushed,I think it definitely could have been a bit longer but it is generally a pleasing finale.The performances are all fantastic,Martin Freeman and Ian McKellen shining in the lead roles as usual,but we follow many other great characters and I was certainly more interested in Thorin this time around than I ever was previously.The CGI was my only big problem with this movie,it is definitely used more than it ever was in previous Hobbit installments,and while it does look great,it obviously would have looked better if they used as much live action as they could,but there are certainly some shots were it is all done by CGI and it is very obvious.The Hobbit: the Battle of the Five Armies may have a few flaws,but it is mostly a very pleasing finale to the Middle Earth franchise and I would recommend it to all fans of the series.To stop the Lonely Mountains from falling in to the wrong hands,the elves, dwarfs and Orcs must prepare for battle as Bilbo's journey reaches an end.Best Performance: Martin Freeman Worst Performance: Stephen Fry",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Epic, intense, and dramatic","Having read the book and having seen the first two movies, I cannot say how overly excited I was to see the last installment in this trilogy. I saw it as early as possible and I'm quite glad I did. The movie starts with an intense action packed scene that has some very impressive visuals. Then we get some peaceful time with a little character development and dialogue. After that the real stuff begins. The battle is epic and huge and long. Tons of CGI and mind blowing visuals. It's very intense and dramatic but really fun to watch. Some emotional scenes follow that and then we get a nice and peaceful ending. As always Peter Jackson does a fine job directing another ambitious project. I've always felt that the cast in the Hobbit trilogy couldn't have been better, and in this movie they prove that; great performances by all. The story and plot are good but you really have to watch all the movies because without the others, this one doesn't make much sense (it's still enjoyable though). Finally, as I have said before, the visual effects are really quite stunning on this movie.I do have a few gripes though. The opening scene could have been much longer, they could have focused more on Bilbo, the ending of the battle and such could have been more clear and efficient, and some characters farewells could have been better. Other than that though, this movie was one of the best movies of the year. The whole cast and crew did an awesome job on these movies and I just want to thank them for inspiring me in many ways. This trilogy has been very fun to watch and enjoy and I look forward to watching it many times again.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Satisfactory end to the middle-earth,"Shortest of all but a satisfactory finish to the middle-earth legend. It works as a finale but not as a stand alone film. Thorin being an idiot(dragon sickness) for most part of the film didn't work but when he realizes, the film starts to pick momentum and the last hour is breathtakingly good and this is where it gets the Lord of the Rings vibe.Battle looked great but ended abruptly(extended cut may be?) with the entrance of Eagles and Beorn and it shifted to Thorin vs Azog. Still it was good but don't expect it to match the likes of Battle of Pelennor fields or Helm's Deep.Gandalf didn't had much to do. Sauron will be seen in a scene. Aragorn's mention will make some fans happy. Tauriel is surprisingly good this time. Bilbo was okay but he should have got more presence. We don't get to see what happened to some key members(again, extended cut may be?). Earlier half of the film was wasted at Arkenstone subplot. It should have been chopped a bit and that run time might have helped the climax, giving it some depth.HFR 3D looked different and added depth to the dialog scenes but it looked cartoon-sh in the action sequences.Will miss these films :( Oh wait , Silmarillion may be ? is it too much to ask Mr. Jackson?",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
7.5/10,"The Lord of the Rings trilogy is my favourite movie of all time. But my passion for middle earth doesn't stop there, I am obsessed with this world and in love with the vastness and complexity of its characters and stories. So, did I like the movie? Yes, a lot. Was the movie actually good? That would be more debatable. Before I go into the thick of this review, I just want to remind that I really like the movie, but if it seems that I am highlighting only the negative points it is because they are so frustrating.Everything that is wrong with this and the other two Hobbit movies are basic filmaking decisions that are wrongly taken. This is to say that Peter Jackson's brilliance remains, he gave proof in all of these movies that he knows how to direct his films. There is nobody in the world that knows how to stage a battle like him. He takes us through amazing visual choices and complex staging flawlessly. The fluency of everything is magnificent, thanks to an amazing pace. Despite me thinking about the wrongs of it, I could not help but be flattered by the sheer epicness of this. I was genuinely on the edge of my seat, I felt amazing tension at times, I really loved the experience and was attached to the very end to the characters. Every one of them. The duels were fantastic, it was all riveting. But there were simply decisions that were made early on that took away from it.Why are these movies shot digitally! Other than looking very bad it does not make sense. The whole 48fps, 3D, digital shooting was a mistake to being with. These films shot have been shot on film, just like the Lord of the Rings, it would have given them a thousand points more. The whole CGI is just too much. There isn't any of the practicality from the first movies and it shows so bad. Digital masses of everything that have no weight and look way too bad for a 500million$ production. I am convinced that by shooting on film and loosing half of the CGi in favour of practicality would make these three movies ten times better. To this point by removing half of the CGI we could also remove all the extravagant madness that comes from it. There are scenes or monsters in this film that would have never even passed first draft back in the Lord of the Rings, because they are so weird and out of the moment (talking for example about that Legolas moment in this one, those of you who have seen the movie understand me). Other than this you do not waste time on characters we don-t give the F***K about! I am really OK with making three movies out of the Hobbit, you know if it's the last time we visit Middle Earth we might as well throw in everything that Tolkien wrote that could fit in. But lets not waste time on Alfrid or the Governor! You know three two/hour movies could have really made it! Anyways, I don't want to indulge in my frustration too much because it would be a waste of time. Go see the movie if you-re a fan like me, you won-t be disappointed more than you were with the other movies. They are really good, but they could have so easily been f****g great!",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great fantasy adventure,"The Lord of The Rings are still occupying the three top places of my top ten movies list. Needles to say I am a fan of Tolkien and his Middle Earth fantasy story. I never felt that The Hobbit series could match the original trilogy but then much of the story in The Hobbit is not really Tolkien's but produced by Hollywood scriptwriters to embellish the story enough to fill three movies. It is not a bad attempt by any means (for being a Hollywood one) but it does not really reach the heights of The Lord of The Rings.Still, I quite liked these movies. They are good adventure, fantasy, special effects movies. Thus it saddened me when I went to IMDb and the first things I saw was a bunch of people shouting crap and giving it one star reviews. That is just so much rubbish. This is the third movie and it is not vastly different from the others. If you disliked the first ones so much why go and see this one? Also, the harping about not following the book. At this point that is a nonsense argument. It was fairly obvious that it was not going to follow the book in detail when it was announced that there were going to be three movies and if you did not get it then then you should have gotten it from the other two movies. One star ratings looks more like trolling to me.Anyway, back to the movie itself. I definitely liked this movie better than the second one. It was on par with the first one for me. There was less silly stuff, less stuff that just felt like fillers and the special effects were generally good.The story and the implementation is, as I wrote, less filled with fillers as the last movie. At least from my point of view. Still though, the story is not at all up to the standard of the original Tolkien works. It shows that it is a Hollywood product that favors effects and quantity before depth and quality. The battle at the end was epic but at the same time somewhat nonsensical in how people ran back and forth clobbering people and beasts right left and center. I did quite like the ramming troll though.I have to say that I did not like that weasel Alfrid though. Sure he was meant to be disliked but he got tiresome rather quickly. He could have been left out after being pushed into the water as far as I am concerned. After that I just got annoyed every time he appeared and I got especially annoyed by the fact that everyone, even Gandalf, seemed to trust him to actually do what he was told. I was hoping to the end that he would meet a gruesome end.On the whole I definitely liked this movie. It had a ""Tolkienesque"" atmosphere, decent acting, decent story and loads and loads of special effects. Even though it does not reach the heights of The Lord of The Rings it is definitely great entertainment for the fantasy, not to mention special effects, lovers.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Why so serious, about it?","O.K.Ladies, gents, let me tell you,first of all , that I read all of them Tolkien books, about this saga. Second of all, when I was younger(I am 42 now), I was really critic about movies made that were based in History or Literature, if they did not stick to the core of its font. But, once, I read an interview of a very well known director, whom I will not name because it does not have anything to do with this movie, who said ""Hey, I'm not a history teacher (Literature teacher, could apply here), I am a movie maker, I wanna show something, my view"". That small sentence changed my whole point of view, about these kind of movies.This Battle Of The Five Armies,accomplishes a very good point of view about the ""Smaug's plot"", and respects the plot points of Thorin and his kin(Great last Thorin scene, with Bilbo, even if as far as I know, Bilbo was not there in the books). In the other hand, the movie takes many plot licences, but, it's a movie, not the book. The only thing that I can criticize it is the fact that the final battle did not really show the defeat of the ones who were defeated. Â¿What did it take, 30 more seconds, of them running scared, to show?. And the end seemed kind of abrupt, in a general point of view, but many of the main characters got their ""closure"" . All in all. a good movie, worth to see, even if you read the books or not.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""There's only a hundred of them."" - says Thorin to Dwalin as the two of them face an army.","Is Jackson parodying his own fight scenes or what?But anyway, The Battle Of The Five Armies is a film that mostly just suffers from being 2 hours of battle and half an hour of actual character scenes.There's a very incompetent feel about the Hobbit as a whole. An Unexpected Journey had too much plot, The Desolation Of Smaug had plot, but that was bizarrely cut out for more fight scenes and the cheesy subplot and this one goes even further by being one huge battle with little plot pellets in-between.To give Jackson credit, the movie still managed to entertain me a lot and there was much to love, like Alfrid, Thorin's development, Bilbo and Galadriel's standoff with Sauron. But those moments are few and in- between.How come there's so much time and yet the film accomplishes so little? Why is the ending so rushed(though it is a wonderful ending)?If I'd been Jackson, I would've padded out the second movie(so that people would want to see the third one) by lengthening the Mirkwood section. Remember the magical river, black squirrels, the starvation of the dwarfs and Bilbo's taking command? Had they turned the forest into a real threat, it could've easily filled out a large portion of the movie, plus the Dol Guldur subplot and maybe an early introduction for Bard on his own?Have the movie end with them seeing the mountain, like the first one.But no, all the padding is here. It is good padding, though as we see Thorin really well developed(though everyone else is just kinda there - like Radagast and Beorn and the rest of the Company) and the focus on the people of Laketown works great. Bard is also a charismatic character and then there's the wonderful Alfrid.Whatever happened to the Master though? I kept expecting him to reappear as he was in the trailers. He would've made a great comparison to Thorin like he did in the books(he supposedly fled with a load of Erebor gold and died alone).The highlight of the film for me was the Galadriel scene. Psychedelic(almost like a horror film) and scary as hell. She reminded me of the girl from The Ring in those scenes.Overall, the film is extremely padded, but it's the good kind of padding.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not as good as the last movie, but brings the Middle Earth saga to a satisfying close","Before I start talking about the movie just know that this review is coming from a rather biased perspective, as I love just about anything to do with Middle Earth. That being said, lets start the review. It's a pretty solid movie. Not quite as good as the last movie and I had some issues with it, but overall I had a good time. It's pure action, very little else. Since the action was filmed pretty well it didn't bother me that much, but I could certainly see why it would annoy someone else. The elf/dwarf romance is not at all improved from the last movie. When your movie is 2 Â½ hours, you don't need a pointless romance that has no emotional weight. It just wastes time. The last thing that bothered me was one part where there is a bridge collapsing and Legolas is running up the falling chunks of rock and it looked absolutely ridiculous. Reminded me of Mario and took me right out of the movie. That being said I still thought it was a good movie. The action is well filmed, the cinematography is fantastic, and it brings the Middle Earth saga to a satisfying close.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It ends/begins here,"Depending on whether you're thinking Hobbit or Lord of the Rings. Whatever the case, you can't fault the movie for its technical side. It looks beautiful, but that was to be expected. Having only read a quarter of the Hobbit novel (which was the first movie more or less, with some additions), I can't comment on the differences in this, though people have stated that some characters weren't in the books and are seen here (it shouldn't matter though).I didn't like the fact that Jackson went for the ""1 girl, two lovers"" teen romance thing, but I guess you have to deal with some of those things and incorporate them into your movie. It's a good conclusion and it was a nice watch, which didn't feel like it was almost two and a half hours. You'll either love it or be bored by it.Edit: I really wanted to read the book/novel, before watching the movies. But I only came around reading the first chapters of it. Jackson really invented something here and he made all of this with as much love and attention to detail as possible. Even if he doesn't seem to remember all the names (of characters and such - Stephen Colbert would not be amused). Watched the extended version of all Hobbit movies and have to say, I enjoyed the ... trip (no pun intended)",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""The Hobbit"" shouldn't have been brought to the daylight.","Hi,I knew from the first time that The Hobbit will never rise to the mighty of ""Lord of the rings"". How we are usually saying ""The hope die the last one"". So I said, if will be at least half as LOTR it will be enough.First Hobbit was a good introduction, second one was even better they build so good the legendary dragon, his character, the fear that could generate to the beings of that world.Shortly after the beginning of the ""Battle of two armies and a half"" started I had a shock. After that I tried harder to see the good parts, to find myself a hero, to stay with the story, I really tried! But there was no hero, no story, no battle of five armies. (Atually the battle is a joke)But I saw the ""DRAMA"" of having too much gold!Has some good parts like costumes, some speeches, make-ups and an ending so stupid that ""cannot"" be predicted.About 134 minutes passed I was standing on the chair everyone was leaving and I was still waiting for something to happen - sad.It will remain a weight for Lord of the Rings which is cursed to drag it across the history that it will make.Cheers, Adrian",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Something that rhymes with Hobbit, starts with SH","The third part of the trilogy (?!) is by far the worst ever movie inspired, if inspire is the word to be used in any relation to this movie, by a Talkien book.If Peter did it for money - I understand. I hope he is happy for taking the money from people earning 250 EUR per month in my country, and that is with the story which is about how gold eventually corrupts everything. In a way, he proved the point, didn't he?But, if Peter truly believes that THIS was the Hobbit, than something is seriously wrong with his reading and directing skills.Hollywood at its worst, 144 minutes of violence based on anti-war children book. Could there be a bigger nonsense than this?!Fortunatelly, this gives an opportunity for someone to make a good Hobbit movie soon.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Absolutely loved it...absorbing and great fun,"Actually, I was looking for 8.5 but no option for half points, so I thought I'd err on the side of entertainment. Not a movie for the arty, cultural elite, perhaps, but for pure entertainment, laughs, delights and lots of action and adventure it's first class.....not to be missed!!! The costumes and graphics are amazing, the story keeps one's interest and bowls along with no flat spots. My wife and I were both surprised that the time had gone so fast by movie's end. I think that Peter Jackson and his vision and the crew he assembled have changed movies for the better, bringing another dimension to the genre and the expectations of movie-goers around the world. A big yarn on a big screen, loved it!!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Epic,I love the final confrontation between Azog and Thorin because they had been enemies since the first film. It was sad to see Tauriel when she was laying beside the body of her lover Kili because she took care of him when he was shot by a orc in the second installment and he was beheaded by Azog and his son Bolg,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Epic Mythology v The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies (A Review),"The Hobbit The Battle of the Five Armies was Peter Jackson's adaptation of the popular fiction of J. R. R. Tolkien. Yesterday I was lucky to count on the final act of the Hobbit trilogy on 3D at INOX theater, Jayanagar, Bangalore. The experience was awesome and not comparable to any such high end production. It was an experience, the inner feeling, at a point of time I was thinking, if such story continues for the lifetime may be I would love to keep watching and watching. Yeah! 144 minutes of the video was passed like an eye blink.Some important facts from the movie I wanted to highlight in this review. The epic mythological standard of the Hobbit story is undoubted. In the Indian epic mythology, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, or The Greek epic mythology, the Iliad, or all the literatures of the mythical standards have one thing in common, either a tragic end or the downfall of the heroes.In the epic, The Ramayana, Ravana who was a good king, built the first democratic republic in the human history for his people. He had wealth, gold, and luxury in his kingdom. He was the conqueror of the heaven by defeating the demigods. But at the end he had lost the battle with Rama, an ordinary human prince from Ayodhya, India. Because the one mistake of Ravana by stealing Sita, the wife of Rama. Ravana did not listen to his ministers, brothers and wife to send back Sita, and protect the kingdom. In-stead of the sick king declared his own followers as the traitors and banished them from his kingdom. Here in the Hobbit, the exiled dwarf king of Erebor, Thorin Oakenshield, became blind of all his promises to the people and his followers once he got back the gold treasury. The life of people seemed no value to him in compare to the gold. He lost his conscience and became sick by not trusting his own people for the gems stone, called the heart of the mountain.In the epic, The Mahabharata, Duryodhana, the elder prince of Hastinapura, India. He had claimed to be the king of Hastinapura. He had conspiracies and several false promises made to his cousin brothers for the share of the wealth of his kingdom. In spite of fulfilling his promises he chosen the war which took place at Kurukshetra and ended up after 18 days of devastating destruction and the complete ruin of his life and the kingdom. Duryodhana told, ""Without the war, I will not give even a needle worth of land"". Here in the Hobbit, Thorin, forgot of his promises made to Bard, the dragon slayer and the descendant of Girion, the Lord of Dale and to his people. Bard saved the life of Thorin and his followers. He and his people helped them, by giving food, comfort, and nourishment. Without their contribution it was impossible to Thorin to get back to the mountain. But when the time came to reclaim the promises made by Thorin to Brad and his people; Thorin chosen the war. He was not ready to pay a single gold penny to them.In the epic, The Iliad, Priam, the king of Troy and his elder son, Hector, both of them were aware of the mistake done by Paris. Helen, queen of Sparta, who eloped with Paris, the younger son of Priam, was the cause of the Trojan War. Perhaps Priam act at the right moment to send back Helen and protect Troy. But he did not, which caused the downfall of Troy. In Hobbit, Thorin, it was look like, though he had a small strength of army which was not sufficient to go for a war, declared his own downfall.May be, he could allied with Bard, and Thranduil, the Elven king, have had been helped by the alliance a smooth win against Azog, the Orc chieftain and his Goblin army. At the end, Thorin could have a happy life by ruling, Erebor, until the end of his career. Which he did not act at the right moment, and bring his own downfall at the hand of Azog.Albeit, Peter Jackson had no hand on that part of the story, as, I hope, it was all written by J. R. R. Tolkien in his novel. Albeit the commonness of the Hobbit version of the mythology, here I found beautiful and unforgettable supporting characters like, Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf, Legolas, Saruman, Radagast, and Galadriel. These characters were acted and protected the role of wise, honest, courageous, who were changed the permutations and combinations of the Hobbit, the epic mythology.Thanks!Always love, Vikram",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Awesome,"This movie is the best I've seen period. I read all the lord of the rings books as well as the hobbit And Silmarillion, And of course seen all the lord of the rings movies. I did not care that the script didn't read word for word from the books to me that's geekeie. This was highly entertaining with some of the best if not the best fight scenes ever well worth the blue ray buy..A must see movie it pushed the matrix down to number 2 for me lol. The love story line for me was not a big deal it slightly enhanced the movie but not my cup of tea. I cant wait for them to do the Silmarillion that should make a great set of trilogy's, Hats of to peter Jackson for this great group of movies that surpasses the first",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Perhaps the Best of the Trilogy,"""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" is the final chapter of Peter Jackson's ""The Hobbit"" trilogy, and this particular film tells the last three or so chapters of J.R.R. Tolkien's book of the same name.For those who are fans of the book, one thing that will quickly stand out is that the movie takes great liberty with the book, inasmuch as Peter Jackson has made an entire feature length film out of a story that was told in a relatively succinct fashion by Tolkien. Jackson's work expounds on the story that Tolkien left us with, going into much more detail with character development and the story of the battle of the armies itself in this film.That being said, though, the movie does all of this in a way that is true to the original source material. I didn't feel as though I was watching something that was untrue to Tolkien, but instead a movie that was made to put meat on the skeleton of a story that Tolkien had left us with in the final chapters of ""The Hobbit"".The question does arise as to whether the movie is good overall. It's an especially poignant question to ask given that this film is actually getting more scrutiny from reviews and ratings than its two predecessors. I personally would strongly disagree with those assessments. I found ""The Battle of the Five Armies"" to be on par with, if not better than, ""The Desolation of Smaug"", both of which are much more enjoyable movies than the initial film in the series, ""An Unexpected Journey"". ""The Desolation of Smaug"" is arguably still the best of the three films, but ""Five Armies"" tells an engaging tale that caps off the series nicely and left me feeling very pleased with the trilogy overall.Perhaps the weakest part of the film, I felt, was the foreshadowing of Jackson's other Tolkien-inspired trilogy, ""The Lord of the Rings"" from a decade ago. ""Five Armies"" tries to set up that separate tale (of which ""The Hobbit"" movies are prequels) by showing a battle between Sauron vs. Gandalf and others. This battle (a brief scene that diverges from the rest of the movie) suffers from a poor special effects technique that culminates in an odd light show on the screen for a few moments. Still, this doesn't ruin the overall film.Again, for me this movie may be the best of ""The Hobbit"" trilogy. It certainly is worth watching, and certainly deserves to be rated more favorably than its ""Unexpected Journey"" prequel. I'd give it 8 out of 10 stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Battle Fatigue,"ï¿¼ This film is mildly recommended.Let's face it: The Hobbit film series was bloated and overblown from its initial start. The slim book became a overly-massive trilogy directed by Peter Jackson, in the hopes of making a classic epic story with his prior Lord of the Rings fame and pedigree. The first film from this franchise was a disappointment, with too much broad slapstick and silliness; the second was a vast improvement with its darker mood and stronger character development, although its ending was abrupt and too much the cliffhanger. Part Three, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, immediately takes flight from that final shot of Smaug, escaping and soaring above, set to raise havoc on the village and its habitants below.ï¿¼Three may not be the charm, but it does have some thrills, more so in the hand-to-hand combat sequences toward the end of the film, less so with the endless army battles on a grand scale. Jackson and his company provide enough of a rousing adventure even if their overuse of CGI sacrifices its characters and story. Too often, the film resembles a video game in far too many action sequences. While it's true that everything about this film installment entertains, it all seems frenzied and artificial.ï¿¼The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies also seems choppy and redundant. While there is much to admire technically and the visual look of the film is epic, Jackson pacing is off this time around as he undercuts his suspense with the episodic structure of the film. He becomes too preoccupied with the war sequences and their staging, relishing in the slaughter and celebrating the war, the very antithesis of the Tolkien source. But it does sell more tickets.ï¿¼The actors try to bring some depth and emotion to their underwritten roles, but seem to be mere pawns in Jackson's action gamer. Most of the actors overplay their roles with hammy facial expressions and gestures, barking out the dialog rather than subtly underplaying their line delivery. Some of the sound design is over-amplified to give a more dramatic spin, but the opposite effect applies. Coming off best are Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins, Ian McKellan, Orlando Bloom, Luke Evans, Aidan Turner and Evangeline Lilly; others like Lee Pace, Billy Connolly, Stephen Fry, and, at times, Richard Armitage suffer with their poorly written characters. However, Ryan Gage as Alfrid plays his character like a Monty Python wannabe, trying for comic relief and coming up this short of annoying. Even more talented actors seem wasted with mere walk-ons like Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, and Hugo Weaving.ï¿¼Production values continue to be top notch, particularly the art direction by Simon Bright and Andy McLaren. The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies could have used a lot less armies and a lot more depth in the characters and story. The war may have been won, but the battles were lost in this film adaptation.

Battle of the Rushed Post - a Michael Bay film,"Sadly all the 'epic' was left on the cutting room floor. Somehow all the cheese, bad lines and bad make up close ups all made it in.Everything was rushed or non existent that pertained to character development. And without connection to the characters a movie feels b grade. Regardless of the immense budget, actors quality, next level cgi and advertising.Three movies should have been two. First film ending with Bard stating they need to seek refuge in the mountain after lake town destroyed. Second film focused on fattening and tying off the characters stories. Not two hours of fighting and ten minutes of storyline hamyness, cringing and head shaking at the end. And almost no worthwhile hobbit or dwarf dialogue.It's still a spectacle of a film. But I don't understand any of the decisions to cheese it instead of this being a gritty powerful opus.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A work, worthy of Sauron!","This ""movie"" is definitely worthy of being thrown into the fire! My in-laws gave us the tickets (to be fair - we would have been so stupid and payed for it ourselves... so... there you go: We FINANCED further abominations like this!) Whatever happened to good, decent filmmaking? This was a terrible, over-the-top, soulless WAR MOVIE!!! It feels as numb and un-emotional as a general anesthetic. There were main-characters dying? Oh, true... well, who cares? Remember anyone the death scene of Sean Bean in THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING (yes, he always dies - but he died really well in that one) Oh, or who the F cares about some CGI-Mega-Orc fighting a dwarf on ice Flash Gordon Style? And also: Did he touch the ground of that frozen lake before he jumped back to ruin some more or less decent CGI-Death-Scene? - or did he do the Legolas ""I don't care about gravity"" thing? Questions above questions - yet now answers! I'd like to ask Peter Jackson what the hell happened! Was he forced with a gun to his head to make this? Or did he just direct it from a smart-phone, while sitting on his couch at home and counting his money? Yes, I'm aware that the TRUE EVIL, the true Morgoths are the Studios and the endlessly greedy film industry! If young people like Playstation graphics and action, shaky-cam and *beep* 3D - let them have it! Who cares about nice cinematography when the highest grossing movie are made in absurd-looking 3D and with completely over-the-top everything! In the last 14 years since the FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING came out, I was telling my nerdy friends (and everybody else) how amazing the Lord of the Rings movies are, how muche love and effort went into them.I was amazed about the fact, that Peter Jackson said NO to too much CGI, that he used real sets, models, amazingly detailed costumes and beautiful cinematography.ALL of that went down the drain with this one... this boring, crappy looking CGI-disaster, this Mexican Standoff in Middle Earth.What was the ""story"" again? Some greedy dwarf does not want to come out of his cave - and suddenly all kinds of armies show up... to fight each other in a ridiculous way...The last 10 minutes then felt like some different move... somehow like the original Trilogy... BECAUSE THERE WERE REAL LANDSCAPES.It felt like something really beautuful standing next to something really ugly. But this short moment of ""how to make a nice, decent, GOOD movie"" did not save and also not redeem this perversion of cinematic history! This could as well be titled: WORLD OF WARCRAFT - THE MOVIE.Other titles: Legolas, Dwarfes, CGI-ORCS and other stupid stuff in: TO HELL WITH GRAVITY! Watching THE FELLOSHIP OF THE RING makes you believe in the good things in this world: Friendsip, beauty, decency, good filmmaking... everything that is right and just and good. Everything a guy like Aragorn would put into an epic speech before a battle that mattered.The battlescenes of the CGI-Creatures did not matter. And having too many trolls with too many artificial limbs - or an Orcs with a Klingon Bathleth-Prosthesis (and I usually like STAR TREK references... maybe just not in a Middle Earth Movie) I am not just disappinted. I am shocked by this mess. How can the SAME director that made the BEST TRILOGY EVER do this? Well, the same question has been asked countless times about George Lucas.Good Job, Peter - you killed filmmaking. I am also not sure if you are honest about promoting this disgusting gimmick called 3D or you just have to do it because the industry wants you to do so! Damn it - this is the time of bad movies gone too far, the age of darkness... J.R.R. Tolkien could write some words of truth about this - but he's dead (lucky him... so he does not have to bear what they did to his beautiful vision!) This is the age of darkness indeed. The age of greed! I tend to believe that it is not completely Peter Jackson's fault - it is the perverted, greedy film-industry. They do not think in art or beauty or decency - they think and care only about profit! They exploit everything.The sad part is the people defending all that because the wrongly connect it to something that is good and beautiful. But the connection is wrong! Just because it has partly the same actors, the same director and is supposed to play in the same universe as the good trilogy does not make it the same.George Lucas tried (and failed) in doing the same. Overkilling something with CGI and bad writing is not filmmaking - it's a shame! Personally, I do the same here that I do with this terrible STAR WARS PREQUEL TRILOGY: I never watch it again. I imagine the events of Bilbo's adventure with the dwarfes from the visual and artistic perspective of Ian Holm in THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS - there could still be something great being made - but please by another director.Somebody young and hungry and talented. Some person like the Peter Jackson of the 1990s. Somebody who LOVES the source-material and has a vision of it - but not a financial one! What also works - and it's totally for free: Imagination. Having a good actor talking about something rather than showing it invokes a million times more beautiful images than cramming it down your throat with a CGI funnel! Anyway - whatever. This needed to be said! And somebody like RED LETTER MEDIA should really make a review similar to the STAR WARS PREQUEL reviews! May the Force be with you - Gandalf",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disappointment,"I am not a big fan of movies but I do watch every movies from the trilogy of The Hobbit. Ufortunately, not the LotR trilogy because I prefer to watch Harry Potter at the moment. Today, I am disappointed, from overwhelming interesting movies (of course in the end, the movies always unfinished, but I tolerate it because the story of the movies is interesting), into the biggest disappointment.Why it's so disappointing? In the beginning of The Hobbit trilogy, including the LotR trilogy movies, all of them are inverted, if you do a ""watching marathon"", starting from the first of the LotR trilogy movies and continued to The Hobbit trilogy, you will be confused (Okay, some of may said, look, it's The Hobbit and the LotR trilogy, it's not the same thing, it's based on the same story but it wasn't meant to be a ""following"" movies, but still I am sure for the big fan of the LotR books, they will be more disappointed)The Battle of Five Armies seems to be easily predicted, it's very plain, there's no tense in the movie anymore, I am not a curator, I can't describe it, but I am sure, something is lost and I don't know how to explain it into words, I simply don't like this movie.Jr.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
excellent,"We leave the theater completely delighted. After seeing the two Hobbit first part of last year and two years ago, we agree darling and me that the battle of the five military is excellent. We enjoyed the special effects costumes of the film. The battle filmed for more than 40 minutes is absolutely breathtaking. This is a great movie that we saw in 3D. After watching this film, we emerged the 3 components of the ""Lord of the Rings"" and spent a day reviewing the masterpiece, the transition between the ""Battle of Five Armies"" and ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" is perfect. We had a great time, despite the length of 2:45, the film held us spellbound from beginning to end ...",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A fairly good ending to the Hobbit,"Rating-7/10The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is an end to the Hobbit film series and a pretty decent film to finish. Yes for me it was kind of good but did well to end it all and bring to a close a good but mixed reaction film series. It's a tad rushed along the way and the special effects are in overdrive at certain moments but nevertheless as I mentioned I felt it to be fairly good and here below is just why so.Now the action in this movie is truly thrilling, it is massive and I mean that with the fighting providing most of the running time of 144 minutes. Now with the fighting we see in films like the Hobbit and of course fellow Middle Earth connected Lord of the Rings, it is always fantasy battles at it's very highest, and that is what you get here. You can't make up some things you see here and this all coming from the mind of Tolkein and the people behind the movie makes this one crazy kind of finale.The cast give it a good go and it is true to say no one character seems to be in more than others, there are a lot of people involved here. Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins is kind of OK if not a little subdued and for some reason he actually doesn't feature that much surprisingly. Ian McKellen, Richard Armitage and Orlando Bloom among others do an OK job and although they excel when acting with true dramatic moments, the less said about the fighting the better, in fact no one here can make the fighting seem un-cringe worthy at times.I feel without good directing this could have completely fallen apart so all credit to Peter Jackson for handling the reigns with a firm but not a strong grip. He seems to make this movie just a little more exciting and the way in which the battles are fought are just magnificently done at times. Now the adapted script is OK but not great, it has some of the more cheesy lines here and there and it is very much up and down, but what it does do is finish this off how it feels it should be, with that same Middle Earth feel it always needs.The effects are truly top of the range and the one's used here are in my opinion the best movies can do these days with technology in this film being kind of mind blowing. I think although the effects are great and all, it doesn't mind showing off a little and some moments will make you think whether that was CGI or it was not, kind of confusing. The epic scale of the effects is also used to it's full extent and I think the producers really wanted this to be the crowning glory of design.Now with such a long running time you can't expect for one this review to be one paragraph, but also you can't expect it not to fit everything in. But, for some strange reason they do seem to rush scenes and that is evidentially there within the first say 20 minutes which if you haven't seen, well you will see what I mean.Overall I felt it was more than OK as a movie and one definitely worth a watch. It was the kind of movie that probably needs to be seen on the big screen to get the full effects but nevertheless this is a fine renting or streaming etc film to watch. Maybe this is the end of Middle earth in cinema and maybe this is capping off two decades of fantasy movies, or maybe just maybeÂ… there is still more to come.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Battle Effects,The hobbit trilogy was awesome the first hobbit was awesome the second was okay but a lot of plot and speaking but the 3rd installment was awesome over a hour of mind blowing special effects of battle this movie is great if you like fighting and not as much plot storyline and boring speeches this movie is great but the storyline could of been better I could see why a lot of Lord of the rings and hobbit fans didn't like this one as much it did drop short a bit but I loved it from start to finish I can promise you this will be the movie you will love if your a fan of fantasy and huge battles with great special effects and A list actors and actresses the hobbit was a great successful spin off to the Lord of the Rings trilogy,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"The Hobbit: Battle of the Fives Armies closes a clunky, but satisfying return to Middle Earth.","I always hope that parents do their best to encourage their child to be an artist. All it takes is one good idea to expand into something big; something that's so masterful that the art itself becomes another world. This I refer to is Middle Earth of the Lord of the Rings books. J. R. R. Tolkien barley escaped death in WWI to start on The Hobbit, the beginning idea of something that was going to have life of it's own. The books have picked up cult status in the 1960's, but when the movies came out, the series had suddenly exploded into mainstream popularity.The fan base has grown so large, then when The Hobbit trilogy was announced, the crowd was so hyped up that they assumed that they were going to receive more then a fantasy film; they were expecting something that was going to push what we call magic on the silver screen and even offer philosophical ideas we've never considered before. When the film consensus was good to just okay, I was surprised by much people have translated the idea of okay to really bad. That's certainly not that case; it's just that no matter what any Hobbit movie would pulled off, it was not going to match The Lord of the Rings. So let's take one last descent into Middle Earth with The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies. Beginning where the last movie left off, the dragon Smaug is now flying out of the Lonely Mountain to wreck havoc on Laketown. Two dwarfs are still down there while the rest and Bilbo are back within the mountain. Local townsman Bard manages to kill the dragon by striking it in it's one weak point, making for a great opening sequence.Anyway, Bilbo Baggins (played by Martin Freeman) has found the Arkenstone, the same thing that the dwarfs have been searching for among the dragon's treasure. The leader of the dwarfs, Thorin, has succumbed to the dragon sickness of greed and flat out refuses to share the treasure or even leave the mountain. This doesn't please the Elves, including Legolas (played by Orlando Bloom), and townsfolk of Laketown looking for shelter. At the same time, Gandalf the wizard (played by Ian McKellen) manages to escape his prison to warn the others of the incoming Orc army that also wants the treasure. It'll be hard to determine who will claim the mountain, but Bilbo may have a helping hand thanks to his new ring.The Hobbit has finally ended and I think that this is that last time we'll venture into Middle Earth for a while (with Warner Brothers, of course it's never over). The road has been a bit bumpy but people seems to be satisfied enough with these movies, even if their not at good as The Lord of the Rings. Return of the King and Battle of the Five Armies are similar finales with a lot of action and plenty of goodbyes. Now which one is better?It should be a no brainer that Return of the King did it masterful, so toping it was out of the question. But Battle of the Five armies really tries. For pure popcorn entertainment, I definitely got what I wanted. The action and look of the film all pay off is some CGI environments that Maleficent should have done. The cast here also continues to prevail, weather it's Bilbo as a conflicted coward, greedy dwarf Thorin, or a no nonsense wizard Gandalf. What's interesting is that Battle of the Five Armies shares the only flaw with Return of the King; and ending that takes too long to end. At least it's not as long, so it's not too much of a complaint.I'll give this eight Arkinstones out of ten. Desolation of Smaug was my favorite of the Hobbit movies, but this closes the book nicely as well. Those that don't like fantasy will not be swayed here, but I thin few people are going to hate this story. The Hobbit will probably not be as regarded as a masterpiece adaptation, but at most an interesting series of fantasy blockbusters.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A film that should probably not have been made,"I may be alone in my belief that the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings trilogy should not have been made into films.The message lying at the heart of the books, reflects, for me, a deep sadness and reluctance in the face of war. Tolkien was appalled by Stalinist Communism and Hitlarian Nazism, in equal measure. He was also appalled by the indiscriminate bombing by the allies that took place during WW2.Tolkien was in many ways a moderate who had first hand experience of and an abhorrence for the horrors war inflicts on ordinary people.Regrettably but perhaps, predictably, the anti war sentiment at the heart of Tolkiens works is largely lost in the films.What we get instead amounts to visually pretty, action films. There is lots of exposition but little character development.This is in spite of an excellent cast of top shelf actors.The Battle of the Five Armies continues this trend offering large helpings of action, clever special effects and bloodshed but little else. The net result is you are left feeling rather empty.Yet another technically competent, commercially driven but ultimately soulless outing. Six out of ten from me.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beautifully punctuates its association to the greater saga...,"The fifteen year middle-earth adventure helmed by Peter Jackson comes to a close in The Battle of the Five Armies. As an amalgamation of emotion and spectacle, this ranks high in the saga for me. The action highlight in the movie, as made evident from the title, is an immense climactic battle. But there is also a clash of a more mystical nature involving the older guardians of Middle-Earth, in Dol Guldor, that is short but spectacular. On a more human level, this final chapter features the profound tragedy missing in the LOTR trilogy. For the first time in a Middle-Earth movie there is no prologue as we straightaway witness Smaug the dragon's incredibly visualized assault on Laketown; an airborne dragon attack has never looked so magnificent. It is a brief but satiating appetizer for the adrenaline to get going. From there the movie changes gears to set-up a few things & allows the characters to take over. Bilbo (Freeman) and Thorin (Armitage) deliver some great moments. Looking back at all 6 films there is no doubt Bilbo will be remembered as the definitive Hobbit; he brings the character to life through copious expressions & mannerisms which add warmth to the role. In the previous films he shared great moments with Gollum and Smaug while here his notable scenes are in the presence of or in context to Thorin. The said dwarf king, consumed by greed, is also a memorable personification of an anti-hero. It's interesting to witness the trajectory his character goes through during the trilogy; from a single-minded steely determination to total disintegration. He manages to generate substantial empathy through this process. Most of the other important supporting characters get to shine in individual moments. Ryan Gage's role, as the cowardly Alfrid, was the bleak film's only comedic relief and he was unexpectedly excellent. Gandalf (Ian Mckellon) is incredible as usual and reinforces himself as my favorite character in all the 6 pieces of this wondrous adventure. Jackson also wonderfully weaves in smaller details & subplots in the film to connect the story to the world & time of LOTR. Gandalf's side-expedition, which was essentially nondescript in the book, gained traction in the middle film and now comes full circle with a brief but rousing finish. Some editing and missing through-lines suggest that fans will again need to rely on an inevitable extended edition for the definitive version of the film.Aesthetically and in terms of scale, Peter Jackson forms a smaller but distinct looking final conflict from the two major battles of the LOTR films (Helm's Deep & Pelennor Fields). It is more logistical in nature and he captures it nicely using a floating virtual camera giving us appealing wide-angle shots. The chaotic clash takes place against the backdrop of the Lonely Mountain and on its snowy/frozen fringes making the battlefield an actual character. The amount of detail and individual heroic-character moments is abundant; for every over-the-top Legolas moment there are others that left me in admiration of the landscapes and battle-choreography on display. Also, the fact that there are tragic incidents in this conclusive chapter makes it leave an arguably greater emotional impact than any LOTR film. Looking back at the Hobbit trilogy it's hard for me not to look at these films through a haze of nostalgia. They are less complex and lesser as a result compared to LOTR trilogy. But they still feel transcendent & cinematic and the final delivers in terms of scale & emotional involvement.Overall, Battle of the Five Armies beautifully punctuates its association to the greater Middle-Earth saga that follows. It also affectionately conveys a sense of completion to Bilbo's grand adventure. Jackson's ambition deserves to be lauded as he ends his Middle-Earth journey and for me, cinema will not be the same... well, at least December won't.*I look forward to re-reviewing/re-grading the entire Hobbit trilogy after watching their definitive extended editions.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A satisfactory conclusion to the series. 72.5%,"I'll just provide a brief impression of this movie, as it's the 3rd of 3, so if you've made it to this movie, you'll be familiar with the story so far.After a poor first movie, the second movie was quite good and where you'd expect a movie of this budget and background to be. The finale falls somewhere between the quality of the first two. I was considering giving this movie a simple ""Pass"" score (as opposed to ""Fail""), but it's a bit better than that and my score of 72.5% is there or there abouts.One thing that is interesting about this series is that the first movie seems made for children but by the time of the final movie it is more adult in tone and themes. That would work for a young audience viewing these films as new releases but not so much if a young child was to view all three films in quick succession on disc or online. From memory, this final film has a shot of someone being beheaded.Positives about this film include:* Ryan Gage's performance as Alfrid. Gage is quite funny at times in this role. He puts into mind the very first series of Blackadder...he reminds me of that sitcom's titular character there...but funnier.* Moments of poignancy regarding characters and relationships.* Some of the large-scale battle scenes were well done. Some movies can't get this right, e.g. George Lucas' Star Wars movie ""Attack of the clones"". Director Peter Jackson did a magnificent job in this regard in the best movie of the ""Lord of the rings"" trilogy, I think, in ""The two towers"". This isn't up to that standard, but it's good, nonetheless...has a touch of Saturday matineee swashbuckling to it, amidst the more sombre fighting scenes.Not exactly a negative, but when you first hear the voice of Dain, you immediately know who is playing him (perhaps...not all people would be familiar with him though). It makes you wonder if Tolkien's world had that actor in it!By the by:Watching the end credits, the sheer number of people is staggering, especially with specific crew titles. In one category I counted over 50 crew and in another category I couldn't keep up after I counted over 80 crew members in a particular category...there would have been around 90 or so there, I imagine.Lastly, I'll just say that the final film in this series does make it worth watching the series. That's a pointed comment to series like The Matrix, which starts off magnificently and goes nowhere fast from then on. ""The Hobbit"" series started off as ""The Matrix"" series finished but quickly established a reasonably good outcome.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
So many negative comments for such a good movie...,"Since this movie has been released, I read many bad critics saying about the lack of plot, the attempt of Peter Jackson to extend the plot and to create 3 movies out of 1 book just for the money. Bu...it. The movie is great! The movie is as great as the lord of the rings movies with the only difference that the concept and the characters are not original anymore. So what? I had a great time watching this movie! There were no idle moments, no plot gaps, no other crap I was reading about. The battle scenes are great, there is drama, love, fear, greed and other states of mind when watching the movie. The acting was very good given the circumstances (you do not except shakespearean performance from Ian McKellen when killing an Orc...). It is unfair for this trilogy that the lord of the rings trilogy came first. It is also unfair for Peter Jackson to create such an epic movie and receive all this criticism based on prejudice. 3 movies out of 1 book? How can this be done? It can be done greatly when Tolkin is writing and Peter Jackson is producing.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Surprisingly entertaining movie-A fan review,"First of all I am really a fan of the hobbit book. Have read it at least 5 times in my life and probably will continue to do so in the future. The first hobbit movie was pleasant but in my opinion the 2nd one was very bad. Pacing issues and completely new story. Everything from the book was changed so it fitted (I am sorry to say so) Peter Jacksons very small perception of causality and fun (at least theatrical perception, I don't know him in person). Because of the groundwork of the 2nd movie this one had no chance to follow the source material even one bit. The new story was a mess and had almost no connection to the book anymore. Many dialogues got me almost bursting out laughing. So much clichÃ© and dumbed down talking. Then I realised suddenly that I was really enjoying the movie. It was a free for all in middle earth. Imagine a rather silly fight focused anime mixed with shakespearean moments. It was awesome for the most parts. In a particular sad scene Bilbo acted completely like a toon character. The fight scene before was straight out of a looney tunes short story and the dwarfs went 100% warhammer meets scots. If you are a fan of quiet moments, slow pacing and want a movie true to tolkiens legacy this one is pretty bad but as an action flip it really gave me a lot to enjoy. Delightfully cheesy from a director who went out to give us a compilation from all his clichÃ©s while mocking them himself. Only thing that bothered me was the really well written end. It was very very good and reminiscent of the best the lord of the rings had to offer. It was breathtaking and had very well slow emotional moments. This did not fit the tone of the movie and made me wish more of the movie would be that way. Movie was enjoyable B-Movie Action spin of off Lord of the Rings but the ending was truly magnificent. I would actually be happy to see the hobbit interpreted again with a mor serious tone so you can choose what you prefer. Another small complaint is that the movie clearly is cut in a few parts which definitely need the extended cuts. Some scenes were extremely rushed.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One Last Time...?,"Here we are at last. After 726 minutes of Lord of the Rings (I'm including the extended Blu-Ray editions as i recently watched them all) and 343 minutes of The Hobbit so far (once again, the extended editions) we have the final instalment of our journey through middle-earth. What a ride it has been. Shall we do it one last time?The Hobbit series so far hasn't at all gripped me in ways that LOTR did. I found An Unexpected Journey way too long, yet a solid start, and although The Desolation of Smaug was a much improved addition to the Middle Earth saga, it still stood in the shadow of all films within the LOTR trilogy. Now we have The Battle of Five Armies, a film that starts with a superb opening scene following on from the conclusion of the previous film, in which the monstrous Smaug descends upon Laketown with death, and death in huge numbers, in mind. Ironically, the epicness and awe-inspiring first section of the film is never really surpassed in the two hours that followed.In terms of the good, the first is that the film is much shorter than the previous offerings resulting in a better pace as well as eradicating the feeling that the story was dragging on, something which i had felt particularly in the first film. Secondly, Richard Armitage is fantastic as Thorin, and in my view stole the show portraying a character battling with his inner demons in a way not too dissimilar from the effects of the one ring, although this inadvertently results in Freeman's perfect portrayal of Bilbo almost being sidelined. Other positive points include the way in which Christopher Lee, aged 92, can still kick shadowy butt, and the way in which the film nicely rounds off the middle-earth saga by leading the audience straight into The Fellowship of the Ring.Now for the bad. For some reason, the makers of The Hobbit Trilogy have gone CGI crazy, particularly within this last instalment, and for me the sheer amount of reliance on such sadly reduces the feeling of epicness i should have been feeling. CGI orcs? Not needed. The orcs in LOTR were brilliant. Why change that? CGI Dain? WHY? You could have easily just asked for Billy Connolly to be in the film directly, yet instead, Mr Jackson or whoever believes his voice is all that is needed and a computer generated version is much better. No. The over-use of CGI also results in the film looking like a video game in some occasions, with some scenes looking like they have been lifted from last years' Shadow of Mordor. Other minor problems included Orlando Bloom looking very scary as a post-plastic surgery looking Legolas, some cheesy love-in moments, and an overall sense of repetitiveness during the titular battle.In conclusion, The Battle of the Five Armies has rounded off the middle-earth saga in a solid, yet strangely unspectacular fashion, featuring a brilliant opening scene as well as a stand-out performance from Armitage, weakened by an over-reliance on CGI and a feeling of repetitiveness throughout the battle sequences. Farewell Middle- Earth. It's been emotional.Overall Score: 7/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A masterpiece,"This film was my favorite of ""the Hobbit"" sequel and just as favorite as ""the Fellowship of the Ring"". I don't get the critical reviews I read. The actors were unbelievably good and well cast - I couldn't think of a better Thorin than Richard Armitage or Thranduil than Lee Pace, or really anyone else who they cast. The picture truly makes you hold your breath and ask for more. I wish J.R.R. Tolkien has written more novels so Peter Jackson can make more movies ..",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Delivers only on the title,"Quickie Review:After the events of Desolation of Smaug, the dragon unleashes his wrath upon the people of Laketown. Thorin reclaims his kingdom, but is consumed by an obsession for all the gold under the mountain. Meanwhile, rest of the Middle-earth races turn their envious eyes towards Erebor. Each of them aiming to exploit its riches, leading to an epic battle that will alter the future of Middle-earth. This movie is the epic conclusion to the Hobbit story, and the name is fitting. There is a grand scale to the battle, and the stakes are high. However, it did not quite strike the balance between action and drama. In the end, Battle of Five Armies is a fitting end to the series of movies and is a great cinematic vision, but as a standalone there is much to be desired in the quieter moments.Full Review:I am a huge fan of Lord of the Rings, sitting through a 12 hour marathon on more than one occasion. So when the Hobbit movie was announced I was excited to return to Middle-earth. Then it was announced that the movie would be split into a trilogy. I really don't like when a story is split, and the problems that come with that decision is most pronounced with The Battle of the Five Armies. Nevertheless I had an enjoyable time watching the movie.When the title is The Battle of the Five Armies, it had better deliver on some epic battles, and it does. It's really interesting to see the motives of each of the armies (for some more in detail than others). Seeing how the battle unfolds, the uneasy alliances, clashing of dwarfs, orcs, goblins, humans, elves certainly had me at awe multiple times. This is a cinematic spectacle that should be experienced on the big screen. Also there was no weak link in the performances, but that is expected by now in the sixth film of this universe.It is strange that I overall liked the film but my positives for the film only include the scale of the battle and the actors. Beyond those two aspects there are actually quite a lot of problems with the movie, and as I mentioned this is all because The Hobbit story has been split into the three films. You already know that all good stories have a beginning, a tension building middle, a climax, and then a resolution. Since The Battle of the Five Armies is the third movie of a singular story, we only get the climax and resolution. This means that the majority of the runtime is spent only on the battle. As beautiful as those scenes were to experience, I must say at one point it all becomes a cacophony of mindless sword slashing. As a result you start to lose any care of what is happening on the screen. I like the scale, just not the length of time spent on it. That leaves the quiet character moments in the movie to pick up the emotional weight to make us care again. Unfortunately these were also too few and far between once the battle starts. Especially if you haven't seen Desolation of Smaug since last year's release, these scenes might be even less effective because the wait between the movies depreciated the natural progression of the character relationships.If I were to judge The Battle of the Five Armies just on its own merits, disregarding the two movies I'd rate it quite low. Yet I will admit that as a conclusion to the trilogy as a whole, this movie does a decent enough job. If you want to get the best out of the film I strongly recommend you to re-watch both An Unexpected Journey and Desolation of Smaug.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I was one of those who saw no need for a third film HOWEVER...,"I will admit I thought doing a third film was a waste of time but at the same time I knew upon its release I will watch it with as much excitement as any other of the Hobbit/LOTR movies.Some people may see this film as not as story telling as the other films but I think that was the point. I think the directors and producers simply wanted to go out with a bang by focusing more on fighting and action scenes than a an actual journey like the other films.To me, the elves truly made this film and I can't even lie Thranduil had me clutching my pearls and getting my life YES GAWD!I know they said this is the final journey but I really hope they continue on with the Hobbit/LOTR franchise, there is so much potential for other amazing films.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Pure excitement in a neat, dwarf-sized powder keg.","Note: To keep eye-strain to a minimum, I will be referring to the three Hobbit movies as H1, H2 and H3, respectively. Thank you. Having felt let-down by the bloated feel of H1, and then surprised by the monumental improvement in the performances and story choices made in H2, I sat down for H3 with tempered expectations keeping me from floating from my seat. And that turned out to be for the best. Because through my lenses of noncommittal gray, Middle Earth became the color of awesome. The visuals were stunning of course, and *most of the time*, believable (but more on that later), and the battle-scenes, the one-on-one variety in particular, were easily the most spectacular of the series. Would that I had had more jaws to drop. And this was H3's strongest point. The fighting raged on almost non-stop, and yet it was so well choreographed, inspired and varied, that I never felt fatigued as I had during H1 (how many damn goblins can there BE under that mountain? Really!). I'll leave my only gripe on this matter in the form of a question: How many good guys can be saved JUST as a raised weapon is about to splatter their head? You very well may find out. The story was compelling. Enough. When the fate of the entire world is not at stake, as it was in the LOTR films, the gravitas is naturally lessened from that level. However, though our heroes' plight is more localized here, the urgency is always apparent and well-conveyed. And though there is no shortage of wide shots, the directors were not afraid to pull in close to let the actors shine when they needed to. There was a certain character introduced who was entirely CGI, which I did not understand the reason for, but trying to cope with that plastic face was the only situation where I was too ""taken out of it"" to appreciate a performance (for some reason, monster races = acceptable-looking plastic. Don't ask me why). Performance-wise, some actors finally seemed comfortable in their own feet (Martin Freeman), some more seasoned ones finally got to kick some much deserving arse (I'll leave the whom to your imagination), and some showed a much wider range of emotions from what had been demanded of them in previous installments (Lee Pace and Aidan Turner). If you're expecting the same feeling of wonder and amazement that The LOTR films brought to your hopelessly geeky heart, forsooth, it is not to be found here. H2 came closest in that regard. No, this is instead a story pieced together by one and a half chapters of actual book, and a whole lot of notes that would be boring in the retelling if not slathered in a sweet sweet sauce of orc blood, dwarf curses and a whole lot of elf swagger, which it was. Thank Sauron, it was.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Another Satisfying LOTR Finale,"Battle of the Five Armies was a satisfying ending to The Hobbit trilogy. Yes, the extended version's 144 minute runtime does seem daunting but do not fret, time will definitely fly as the film is heavy on action and gore. Fans who have clamoured for battle scenes between mythological races will have their fill. I do feel honestly bogged down by the absurdity of the some of the protagonists' arete but it can be rather forgivable.

Epic finale to a legendary story...,"""In a hole in the ground there once lived a hobbit."" An unexpected journey took him over hill and under hill through elvish lands and goblin tunnels where he found that one ring that would soon decide the fate of middle earth against rising evil. Now, the company of Thorin has entered the Lonely Mountain and led Smaug the terrible to seek his fiery act of revenge upon Lake town. Meanwhile, the dark shadow has risen from the past and it threatens to return to the peaceful lands with nefarious orc armies marching towards the gates of Erebor. Against such an enemy, the dwarfs shall follow their King, Thorin, one last time into an epic battle consisting of five armies. 'The Battle of the Five armies' is closer to Tolkien's Hobbit than its predecessors and with just a 144 min duration that engaged viewers with some exemplary CGI and emotionally charged performances, Jackson leaves the world of epic fantasy on a high note.Fire and death follow Smaug's blitzkrieg on Lake Town, that paid no heed to Bard's warnings of imminent ruin. The black arrow is what shall stand between the dragon's wrath and survival of lake men who suffer the consequences of the dwarfs creating havoc in his lair within Erebor. The bowman's heroics saved the town from death but not from ruin and soon he marches with the survivors towards the mountain, to claim their share of the treasures that was promised by Thorin. The King under the mountain has reclaimed the dwarf homeland and the dragon sickness (greed) has taken over his mind while he incessantly searches in vain, for the Arkenstone. With the lake men and wood elves as his unwelcome hosts demanding their righteous share of the treasure, Thorin chooses war in his defense with support from the ironfoot dwarfs in his cousin Dain's army.Meanwhile, back in Dol Goldur, lady Galadriel aids Radagast in Gandalf's release, only to be challenged by the spirits of the Ringwraiths. That's when Elrond arrives and together with Saruman the white, they confront their greatest fear that has arisen from the dead. In a CGI heavy sequence, the white council overthrows the dark lord's spirit with an incredulous assurance from Saruman that he will take care of Sauron himself. We all know how that went down..... Dark clouds gather at the gates of Erebor and as legions of Orcs storm into the valley, every character from the book and Jackson's creative mind is engaged in an epic battle that draws a close to the quest for Erebor.In the midst of the chaotic battles, there yet remains a focus on the relationships between characters and how their dynamics play out when the world around them faces destruction. Jackson's invention of the Tauriel-Killi saga comes to its befitting end with Evangeline Lilly having her fair share of action sequences. Bard rises as a leader of the lake men and while being a responsible father as well, he leads the defense in the ruins of Dale. Thranduil (Lee Pace) marches his Elvish army to the gates with the intention of securing the white jewels but ends up in a battle that he always wanted to avoid. Gandalf (Sir Ian Mckellan) confronts his greatest fear and while he directs the forces strategically during the main battle, at the end of it all, he appears calm and collected while lighting his pipe as though it was just another day in Middle Earth. Legolas (Orlando Bloom)'s stunts are immense fun to watch as he defies gravity with swift actions especially against Bolg, the orc. Thorin, the new king under the mountain goes through a remarkable transition from a determined leader of his company to a tenacious guardian of the profound treasure. This is more a story of Thorin's journey to take back what was once his people's and some of his insecurities seem justified to that end. But the heart of the story is with Martin Freeman's Bilbo Baggins. The lazy Hobbit turned reluctant adventurer who sheds all inhibitions when it comes to choosing right v/s wrong. He is as natural as Bilbo as he is Dr. Watson.Jackson plays all his cards, always keeping the faithful reader and dedicated fan as his target audience. The CGI is superior to some of the sequences in the prior films and takes advantage of the large canvas that Jackson provides for WETA.Howard Shore is partly responsible for the film's epic feel. The soundtrack is powerful in times of war and with tunes of Lake Town and Shire repeating at the poignant moments, one simply becomes a part of the scene. Every digression, addition and impulsion over the previous two installments falls in place now as Jackson manages to steer to the conclusion in less than 150mins. But there's one keen element that is missing from this series. It is the lack of desperation in the quest. Even if the treasure for which the five armies battle it out is immense in measure, the stakes still do not seem high enough. Perhaps this is simply because 'The Hobbit' was a children's tale that Peter Jackson turned into a perilous journey through evil lands seeking justice but ending up with greed.Overcoming the flaws of the previous films in the Hobbit trilogy, Peter Jackson ensures a solid end to a story that shouldn't have taken this long and at the end of all the perilous battles, losses and victories, he smoothly completes the transition to the story of the fellowship. That moment brings cheerful heaviness to the heart at the conclusion of a journey that though off-sequence does feel complete, while leaving a bitter sweet feeling that only Peter Jackson and his dedicated team could, one last time.9.341 on a scale of 1-10.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hobbit 3: A must Watch.,"One of the best coming from Peter Jackson, at last a Hobbit movie that really blows your mind. It really is interesting to see how much progress has been made from the LOTR series be it CGI, details etc. The early hobbit movies where a little dull for my taste but this one surely changes that. I believe this one sticks to the book more than the others but Jackson did change a few things which helps engage the viewer in a good way.

"It is what it is, a decent action movie partly based on Tolkien's ""the Hobbit""","I remember back in 2012 when I first saw the trailers for the Hobbit:An Unexpected Journey, I had very high expectations, since the cast was similar, the new actors were great(I love Martin Freeman) and it was still Peter Jackson's! And after watching the movie I was...overwhelmed. I really thought that it was a flawless film, and I ranked it 9/10(Ironically enough due to some flaws). However, a few weeks later, after the hype had settled here in Sweden, I realized that it didn't really meet up to the bar which had been set by the Lord of the Rings saga, and it left me feeling rather unsatisfied and disappointed. So when the Desolation of Smaug was released, my expectations were lower, yet I still managed to get disappointed.My point with this is that this time, I knew what I'd get. I wouldn't get an epic ending to an epic saga, I wouldn't get an heart warming reunion(such as in the Return of the King) and I wouldn't feel happy and really care about what actually happened. All this I knew, and so the movie delivered the best aftertaste. It is NOT a bad movie, but to expect it to be as well as the Lord of the Rings saga, is like expecting Butter substitute to be butter. No matter how much you try to advertise it as butter, it's still only going to be a substitute.There for I was not disappointed, simply because I did not expect anything great. It had a decent story, cool action and effects, and an okay ending. I would go so far to call it above average, because it never got boring, which to me isn't very common. 7/10. I would recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Epic,"This third and final installment to The Hobbit series is the most epic in acting, effects, and action.

The actors all do incredible job, it proves to be more than just a fantasy adventure film, it's also about sinking into greed, and almost losing yourself, and what friends will go through for you.

Give Peter Jackson & Friends full credit for those masterpieces.,"Peter Jackson rightly sold me the whole Middle Earth. That goes for L.O.T.R. trilogy as much s The Hobbit Trilogy. Brilliantly executed, brilliantly acted and brilliantly presented to an audience that in majority savoured the whole epics. And this latest sequel concludes perfectly so that those of us who don't play offended with Peter's presentation will enjoy hours of re-viewing the whole in the comfort of their home in a not too distant future. Many of the reviewers tend to play experienced critics and their comments feel so unrelated to the actual fantastic presentation of any and all of the movies that I can only think that they can play the mortified to their heart's content but at least they mostly all paid to see this magnificent cinematographic experience and it serves Peter Jackson very well.

Probably the worst of the trilogy but still a good film,"I initially had high expectations for this film, but I had seen a lot of reviews saying it was the worst and I refused to believe it. There were some good bits, like the relationship between Thorin and Bilbo. It also tried to be a bit of a comedy, it really shouldn't have been, yes it is aimed at a younger audience, yes here were some funny bits, but honestly no one gives a dam about Alfred. Also wasn't really the best ending, with the Return of the King they had multiple endings which explained what happened with the characters and was a satisfying end, whereas it sort of just ended. Also parts in the trailer that weren't in the film, really annoyed me. But I'm the extended edition will be better.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The last of Middle-Earth,"In a certain sense, The Battle Of The Five Armies could very well be to The Hobbit series what The Matrix Revolutions was to The Matrix Trilogy. With a battle occupying the center of the film and the title, chances of there being less story to tell abound. And after viewing the movie, I can understand why critics don't really like it.From a critics' point of view, the movie has all that makes them cringe. It has an overabundance of visual effects in an attempt to recreate the epic battles of Jackson's prior trilogy. It has that clichÃ©d love angle / triangle. It has deaths where every death appears a melodrama in itself. It has more connections to the Lord Of The Rings than you can count, effectively making it as a bridge film rather than a standalone one.But then, I'm not a critic. And so, despite all of the above being true in a way, I still enjoyed the film. Yes the movie has a lot of visual effects and clichÃ©d moments. But courtesy Jackson, the clichÃ©s manage to make an impact and the effects still appear spectacular. And this, in an age where CGI has made it notoriously difficult to please audiences is a great achievement. Yes, the deaths appear melodramatic. But having been with the characters since the last two films, they also touch you. Yes there are connections to the decade old Middle-Earth trilogy. But these connections only deepen the impact of every scene by making you realize what lies ahead.Jackson was right when he said this film moves almost like a thriller. The editing is tight, the effects are a spectacle (it would be a shame to watch this first on a laptop / desktop and not on a big screen), and the music almost feels like the culmination of a six-film saga that began a decade ago. Howard Shore masterfully mixes different themes connecting this not only to the previous movies but to the Lord Of The Rings movies as well.It was always my desire to see the first trilogy in theaters, something which I never got to do. With the Hobbit films, I have at least been able to witness Middle-Earth on the big screen.

"Not a perfect ending, but a fitting farewell to Hobbit trilogy","Upon seeing this in theaters, I thought it was a great conclusion. Revisiting it sometime later, I'll be honest, it wasn't a perfect ending by any means. Not to say that it's a terrible one. In fact, it's a good one. It just kind of lacked the spark of the original Lord of the Rings trilogy.Alfred is an annoying side character and there were certain scenes that were too truly devoid of logic such as Legolas jumping on crumbling rocks in the third act.That being said, there were certain stuff I liked. The cinematography is as stunning as it was Andrew Lesnie's last Middle-Earth project before his death in 2015 and the costumes still amaze. The directing from Peter Jackson is still good, the editing is sharp, and the pacing is decent. Howard Shore still gives out beautiful music as ever retaining some of the themes from the last two films and the action remains breathtaking. And of course, the acting from everyone involved is superb with Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen, Richard Armitage, Luke Evans, Lee Pace, and Evangeline Lily giving solid performances as their respective characters.Overall, The Battle of the Five Armies isn't a perfect ending to the trilogy, but it's fitting enough for a farewell after 10 years since it's release. Happy New Year everyone!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good, but not great","I actually went to see it twice already, the first time at the premiere and the second time this week. The first time I thought it was hilarious, a great comedy - but maybe it was because I was affected by the overall emotion around me - so many happy people, meeting the actors, etc. I couldn't wait to see it again because I enjoyed it so much. The second time it was not bad, but not nearly as good. It doesn't drag, but it doesn't have the substance. And worst of all, it doesn't tie all the loose ends. It's basically one long CGI battle interspersed with gags and some dramatic scenes, some of which feel right, some are just plain out of place in this movie. And then it's over, with only two of the many themes developed in the three movies actually finding some closure. So definitely worth watching, but I wouldn't see it more than once, it doesn't have the substance for it, and jokes that are funny the first time feel kind of stale and shallow when repeated.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Battle Between Passion and Commercialisation,"In my humble opinion, while I had enjoyed Peter Jackson's 'The Hobbit' franchise in general, 'The Battle of the Five Armies', as the third and final film in this franchise, is not as well made as the previous two films and offers a commercialised conclusion to an otherwise excellent adaptation of Tolkien's magical world.No one can doubt Peter Jackson's passion for Middle-Earth. His adaptation of 'The Lord of the Rings' is one of the most Oscar-decorated, beloved, and revered trilogies in film history. Now that is an impressive achievement. The real problem with 'The Hobbit' franchise is that some aspects of its production were needlessly over-commercialised. I understand that the investors need to make their money back on such a huge investment, that much is true. But that does not excuse compromises in terms of quality, such as what felt as rushed battle sequences or lack of overall passion. There are exceptions, of course. Some of the actors and actresses in this film still give their all, for example.Is this as good as the other Jackson films in 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit' franchises? No. Does some parts feel over-commercialised? Yes. But there are still a lot of positives about 'The Battle of the Five Armies' and it is certainly an enjoyable film if one unshackles it from the bonds of expectation and overly critical thinking.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"It may not rise to legendary prestige, but it is a fitting, and quite spectacular end to the trilogy.","Like the prequel, The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies is rather long, some scenes are deliberately prolonged to buff the movie's length. However, it does so with crisper action sequences and slightly faster pace. There are many characters in play, each taking turns for their moments in spotlight. They are not the fellowship, yet they mash together sufficiently well to ensure a dynamic cast. With good choreograph and special effect, even though it's longer than it needs be, the movie will still entertain till the end.Story revolves around a recently dragon plagued mountain, the valuable gold residing there and its strategic position attract many armies to fight for its claim, hence the title. It gives some intricacy and politic maneuvering for the backdrop, none too overly complicated and they push the plot nicely. The movie switches attention neatly between Ian McKellen, Luke Evans, Richard Armitage, Orlando Bloom and Martin Freeman, all capable of leading a movie on their own. The prequels often had a character running in circle, thus wasting ten to fifteen minutes. Fortunately, this one divides the scenes with more focus, while it doesn't solve the plodding pace entirely, it ensures smoother transition between characters and their respective battles.Visual is splendidly done. Both the large scale shots as well as the skirmishes have fluid motion to them. The orcs look pretty humanoid, the slimy giants are convincing as they nudge bricks and stones in their path. Some scenes do look digitized, but considering the height difference and intricate details involved, the movie does a good job of portraying the mythical battle. It doesn't rely too much on CG for closer combat, one of the better aspects it has over the predecessors is the scale of combat differs and it simply has more. Choreograph for these scuffle look good since it mixes CG and real stunt efficiently, it also utilizes 3D effect better.The main issue is the same persisting one, it's too thin a script to divvy into two and half hour movie. There's bound to be some padding here and there, like how Thorin wallows in the mountain or shenanigans of some comedic relief, although it's not as bad as forty five minute soiree on Bilbo's house or needless hide-and-seek with Smaug. It fortifies the playtime with incredible feat of acrobat or destruction, few of them are quiet the reminiscence of Lord of the Ring. As half of the it consists of heated battle, it manages to not be dangerously tedious.The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies can be faulted for not delivering what it's promised on the title. It certainly could trim some of its unnecessary dawdling, yet it delivers a marvelous enough last act for The Hobbit trilogy.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fitting finale,"The Battle of the Five Armies finally closes the biggest and most epic fantasy series to ever hit the big screen. And it does so in a fitting way: grand, epic and making the last connections to the Lord of the Rings trilogy.The usual gripes of the Hobbit trilogy are still there: too much CGI, too little story mainly. But just like the Desolation of Smaug this is mostly forgiven by the way Jackson has once again managed to make everything work together. It doesn't feel as 'real' as LotR did, but by now we've come accustomed to the leading Ork villains being CGI characters. Unfortunately, in high frame rate resolution the CGI can be a bit clunky and fake. And if BotFA makes one thing clear, it is that this series should've never been a trilogy. Half of the first movie could've been cut, Smaug and the actual battle could've been one movie. Alas, that's not what happened.Does that mean BotFA is a disappointment, victim of a story stretched too thin? No. All story there is serves to set up one of the biggest battles we've seen in the series, including LotR. One that is sure to excite. The finale on a misty and icy tower especially ranks among the best set pieces in Jackson's take on the series. Underlying themes of dragon's greed, akin to LotR's One Ring obsession work well and show a Thorin Oakenshield that grows ever more insane.Smaug's short presence in this movie is sweet, but in the end made me wish his story would've been either wrapped up in the previous movie or be bigger in this one. A great character with so much screen presence, and a shame to only be in here for a few minutes.There actually is a lot of great humor as well. And big surprise: it isn't even distracting! Right- hand to Laketown's ruler, Alfrid, especially has some great scenes. Although I can imagine people disliking him. Personally, I feel he was a great addition, just like some of the Dwarf fighting and the new uses of the Cave Trolls.Meeting up with the Shire for once last time, finally, was a bit emotional. A sort of cinematic homecoming after all these years. A sense of the peril in Middle Earth finally being over. And while BotFA isn't perfect and certainly has its flaws (most of which are true for all 3 Hobbit movies) it is a fitting finale to a fun and entertaining trilogy.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
My Lord! (of the rings),"That's the polite version of what I was thinking while I sat through this. The rest of the thought was ""Will it ever end?"".The kicker is, there's some very good acting and it's a classic story with some truly touching moments. But the endless repetitive and exaggerated action scenes, unnecessary subplots, ridiculous added material and alterations to the plot distract mightily from the main. Personally, I'm hoping for a directors that culls all three movies down to the three hours total that's required for the story.Less is more, keep it simple stupid.. Choose the phrase. I don't know if it's bloated because of Jackson, or bean-counters, but rumors indicate the latter and it's a shame. Greed.Martin Freeman is brilliant and could have carried all three films (which should have been two at most) by himself, but wasn't really given the chance.

Sensational,"Fantastic ending to a fantastic movie series of Middle Earth. Sad this is the final one, but what a great film this was! Although the movie is close to 3hrs, it certainly didn't feel like it....it actually felt short...so much action and time just flew by...Highly recommend this film, however you definitely need to see the 2nd film to make sense of this 3rd movie as it continues at the exact point where film 2 ends.I loved all the characters and here's hoping Peter Jackson and crew can follow this up with another blockbuster trilogy.

A bit more enjoyable than the second movie,"If you have accepted the direction the trilogy has taken the Hobbit, then this movie will entertain. The Battle of the Five Armies (TBotFA) fixes some of the problems of the previous titles, but introduces a few of its own.The movie starts with the scene that should have been the ending of the second movie. TBotFA has no introduction, no flashback, not a single word on the story of the trilogy: it jumps straight into action. This type of opening works only if people have watched the second movie very recently.With a bit over 2 hours, the movie sits at a much more comfortable length than the first two. TBotFA does not focus on irrelevant details, but sticks to the main story, resulting in a more satisfying pacing.Now that the Dwarfs are stuck in the Lonely Mountain most of the time, the movie relies on many new characters. Because these characters were introduced in the second or even in the third movie, it is difficult to care about them. Several of the newer characters are just plain unlikable. A few fan-favorite characters do return, but sadly they only get between 5 seconds and 5 minutes of screen time.With so few female roles, the focus on Tauriel is understandable, welcome even. But the Dwarf-Elf romance continues to feel forced, uncomfortable and now even childish. This would not have been a problem if the relationship was not so prominent in the movie, but unfortunately it is.The acting is not the problem here, the performances are top notch and are often a joy to watch. That is until the characters make unlikable decisions, giving the scenes an uncomfortable undertone. Often one does not know who to root for in the film. Although that may have been the purpose, it can be unsatisfying.As for action, the bar has been further raised with TBotFA, basically turning the main characters into super heroes. For some viewers it may have reached the point where the action is unrealistic, unbelievable and therefore not enjoyable. Dwarfs killing armored Orcs with simple head-butts, or defeating whole battalions single handedly. Legolas' scenes are very guilty of this (and the question begs if he really deserves to be in 5 of the Tolkien films, one less than Gandalf). The one-on-one fights manage to make a huge deal of very little content.The actual Battle in the second half of the movie is definitely fun to watch. 'Sit back and enjoy the show' seems to have been the idea here. Some scenes do tend to get messy, illogical and stretched out; new races and whole armies are introduced, but then hardly do anything of effect. With the movie named after the Battle, it seems the producers had to use a lot of filler material to keep it going for a while.Once again the movie features breath-taking sceneries and everything looks gorgeous in HFR 3D. Finding a cinema that runs the movie in this quality is recommended.Like the previous movies, TBotFA tries hard to be like Lord of the Rings. Sadly they still could not make it work. The decision to stray so much from the Hobbit tale that has proved itself for over 75 years will probably stay a topic of debate during the coming years.If Lord of the Rings rules king, then its son The Hobbit is not the prince it should have been. It tried too hard and then barely made it to knighthood.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Everything the second film was lacking!,"'THE HOBBIT: THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES': Five Stars (Out of Five)The final installment in director Peter Jackson's three-part film adaptation, of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic 1937 novel 'The Hobbit' (following 2012's 'AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY' and 2013's 'THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG'); which also serves as a prequel trilogy to Jackson's blockbuster 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' movie series (also based on Tolkien's popular books). Jackson once again directed and co-wrote the movie; with his wife Fran Walsh, his other usual writing partner Philippa Boyens and acclaimed filmmaker Guillermo del Toro (who was also originally going to direct 'THE HOBBIT' film series, in two-parts). Walsh and Boyens also co-wrote all of the other Tolkien movie adaptations (as well as multiple other Peter Jackson films) and del Toro also co-wrote the other 'HOBBIT' movies. The film once again stars Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen, Richard Armitage, Evangeline Lilly, Orlando Bloom, Lee Pace, Luke Evans, the voice of Benedict Cumberbatch and many other returning cast members (as well as a few new ones). I highly enjoyed it, surprisingly to me, and think it's the best of 'THE HOBBIT' film trilogy; but I still don't think it quite lives up to any of 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' movies. It's definitely one of the best films of the year though!The film opens, where the last installment left off, with the dragon Smaug (Cumberbatch) attacking Lake-town (which is resolved 12 minutes later, before the title of the movie even appears). Gandalf (McKellen) is still a prisoner of the orc prison and Thorin (Armitage) has gone mad with power and greed. He desperately wants to find the Arkenstone, which he still doesn't know Bilbo (Freeman) has. At the same time armies of elves, dwarfs, people and orcs approach the Lonely Mountain; ready for war. A lot of action ensues.Although I enjoyed 'AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY' (a lot) and thought it was true to the book in spirit, I was deeply disappointed with it's first sequel. That whole movie feels like excessive filler, packed with uninvolving video game style action scenes (that go on for way too long); which makes it a pretty boring and uneventful film. It also lacks it's natural ending (which was instead used to open this movie with) making it by far the weakest installment out of all of Peter Jackson's Tolkien film adaptations. I once was a big fan of Jackson's because he does have a lot of talent and passion for making films but 'THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG' is the biggest example of how much of a sellout he's become (kind of obsessed with power and greed, like Thorin is in this movie). For that reason I went into this movie with pretty low expectations and I was pleasantly surprised to find out I was wrong. The film is completely fast paced, filled with brilliantly thought out and involving action scenes, and it also has a great deal of emotional depth and character development (everything the second film was lacking). It's far superior to 'SMAUG' and definitely the best film of this trilogy (which should have never been a trilogy). Still it's a great movie, one of the best of this year, and a fitting conclusion to the entire epic six film series. Obsessive book fans and purists will still be disgusted, and hate it, but most others should at least have a fun time.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/zsvb7ypwxL4",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Is it really that bad?,"Bottom line: an action-packed movie with lots of wow moments.Like many here I'm a fan of the original fiction, and have been since before LOTR was filmed. Also like many here, I agree that this installment of the Hobbit did not follow the story as well as it could have.But is it really that bad?I don't think so. What I saw was a good movie, but I did not expect it to hew to the story. And that's not bad, even though it's what the purists are getting offended about... but folks, Tolkien was a linguist, not a novelist. His books are not easy reads even though they are filled with complete worlds and amazing stories. The addition of Tauriel as a character bothered me none. The only true fault I have with this particular installment is the additional script work to tie it to the LOTR trilogy, that felt cheap and unnecessary... but it WAS entertaining to watch.With that in mind, I paid for a spectacle, and I got one. I enjoyed my return to Middle-Earth even if it wasn't exactly what Tolkien described.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Amazing imagery, heartfelt emotion for a satisfying, but slightly rushed finale","The final installment of Peter Jackson's Hobbit Trilogy,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies continues in the footsteps of previous installments, but makes a few mistakes on the way. The film succeeds as a finale in a trilogy, but falters slightly as a film on a whole. Some of Jackson's finest abilities as a director shine. The problems never cause enough damage to ruin the experience. The movie redeems itself by the end.Thorin has regained his homeland and the surrounding people and elves want a share in the gold of Erebor. This idea drive the narrative for the first act of the film. I feel Jackson's storytelling ability works here. He sets up some very compelling character conflicts. The problem stands by the fact that most of the characters are not given enough time to complete their development. This become a problem when the battle begins.The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies as the title suggest has a battle. The massive battle really creates the most extraordinary spectacle. Peter Jackson knows how to paint some beautiful imagery. However, the battle extends throughout almost two thirds of the film. This would not present too large of a problem, but in order for it to work the characters need to be strongly developed. One could create the most amazing action pieces ever made, but they will mean nothing unless the audience cares about the characters within the action. Not to say that this happens with all the characters, but after thirty minutes of action, one can start to forget a person's motives. The movie does make the assumption that the audience has viewed the previous installments.In terms of character development, the major standout is Thorin. Richard Armitage gives a great performance and really sells his departure into madness. Thorin's character arc seems to be the only one fully utilized. Bilbo does carry much of the movie as well and Martin Freeman plays him tremendously well. Sadly, most of the other characters are never really fully realized. Some even become more of functional characters, like Gandalf, who merely gives out important expository information when needed. Jackson hit some of the emotional moments with great heart, however a certain relationship in the film seemed a little out of place and never really hit it's intended mark. Also, a few comic relief moments do not really fit. However, in the end it is Thorin and Bilbo's character relationship which carries the film.Peter Jackson has taken a three hundred page book and successfully made three very entertaining films out of it. They may not be perfect films. Some characters never really reach full realization and some become merely functional. When all is said and done, however, Jackson has told a compelling story and created some wonderful imagery. The Hobbit films, though with their problems, have succeeded by the end.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"looks great, story not so...","First off, I'd like to say that I enjoyed the first Hobbit movie. I didn't think it was great, but it was enjoyable. I had problems with the second movie though. Especially the final scene in the mountain kept dragging on. And this is the first thing that bugged me of this third Hobbit movie. The entire Smaug storyline could have been wrapped up at the end of the second movie. The opening scene with Smaug only lasted a few minutes. They could have kept the final scene of the Desolation of Smaug shorter, thereby making it more interesting, and added the demise of Smaug to the second movie and even have time to set up things for this third movie as a cliff hanger of some sorts.Now, about this third movie. Overall the movie had great visuals. I did have some problems though. In the first scenes with legolas his face looked like it was cgi or something. There was something very off with him. The same goes for the face of Dain. It kind of looked like bad console game cgi. Other than that, I really enjoyed the look of the movie. The landscapes were beautiful. The details in the armours looked great.The story was lacking though. It really shows that the source material wasn't enough for 3 movies. The story could have been told in a better way in just 2 movies. I also had a problem with how the writers tried to connect this story with the Lord of the Rings, by mentioning the Strider to Legolas...That's just bad writing.I also found that the movie was lacking in suspense. The battles looked great, but there wasn't really any feel of suspense in them.I'm not sure if I would recommend this movie to anyone. It wasn't bad, but there are better ways to spend your time...",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A satisfying conclusion to a franchise,"And so the Hobbit trilogy ends. After 2 quite plain and frankly boring films the final movie offers more action and less Tolkien (which in this case isn't a bad thing). Battle of 5 armies reminds more of the original LOTR films in both: production quality and advancement of story, of course the film is overly stretched, but that should be expected by anyone who's ever seen a Jackson movie. The film builds upon the story of the first 2 Hobbit movies, but is more independent than Descolation of Smaug. The dragon is a second- order character, which suffers a surprisingly early demise and the story focuses around the storyline of elves and orcs. This does make the story quite anticlimactic, since the initially introduced main antagonist has a net screen time of roughly 40 minutes (over the 9 hour long journey), but BO5A makes up by some of the most beautiful fight scenes I have ever seen and that is enough to make the movie enjoyable. Battle of 5 armies presses strongly on the nostalgic feeling many have toward LOTR with the introduction of a fight scene between Saruman, Galadriel, Gandalf and Sauron, as well as by honoring the ""well-tested"" movie progression of: actual storyline(1hr)-> an epic senseless battle(2hr). The rating I give this film is largely inflated by my fanboyism towards Lord of the rings, since the Hobbit series on their own aren't anything game changing. But this movies is a must-see for anyone who liked the initial series by Peter Jackson and will offer a very nice nostalgia trip.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Peter Jackson, I AM DISAPPOINTED!!","If you are a big Middle-Earth fan like me then you will feel the same. After the epic LOTR trilogy and the two promising Hobbit movies, the battle of the five armies simply can not be related to the whole series. It is not another epic tale, amazing adventure, overwhelming battles, or the enchanting world of Middle-Earth like we are used to.. this movie is just a fighting skills competition between the characters, a massive clichÃ© of drama. it is entertaining with some popcorn, but sadly, nothing more.It was my first time to watch a Middle-Earth movie in the theater, and maybe one of the worst theater experiences I've ever had.Long story short: it is not worth the ticket price.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Rehashed, drawn out, and lack of story","Peter Jackson should have stopped while he was ahead and not attempted The Hobbit films at all. This was no where near the caliber The Lord of the Rings trilogy was (still is). This trilogy is easily forgettable with it's drawn out, rehashed battle scenes, same old formula of what they used in the Return of the King battle scenes. More than the battle scenes, there was a severe lack of a strong story by the start of the third film.
The scenes with finding the Necromancer/Sauron from both the second and third films should've been cut. It didn't help in any sort of way to look for the origins of a villain we already knew about.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Liked it more than I should,"Like most people who grew up in the 2000s I deem LOTR to be a modern day classic fantasy film series like Star Wars was for the kids back in the 70's. This makes me biased when it comes to the Lord of the rings series. Yup I am a HUGE LOTR nerd but even then I am not blind enough to see that the Hobbit trilogy doesn't hold a candle to the original trilogy simply because Peter Jackson decided to make three films out of a single book whereas the each of the book of Lord of the rings got a whole movie treatment. The original Hobbit movie was decent but the lack of quality became most apparent in the second Hobbit film Desolation of Smaug (which is easily the weakest of all 6 films of the series), thus I was a bit skeptical while watching The Battle of the Five Armies (should have been called There and Back Again like in the book in my opinion). Well, I am glad to say that I was wrong I really like this one, it has some good old LOTR charm, hopeless battles in which good guys almost lose, good guys win, bad guys die, some good guys die too, predictable yes but LOTR has always been that and it's still so awesome.What has made Hobbit films unique are Martin Freeman (Bilbo Baggins) and Richard Armitage (Thorin). Bilbo is probably my favorite Hobbit ever! he is charming, funny, resourceful and most importantly isn't at all whiny (yes Frodo you could learn something from your uncle Bilbo). Thorin started out as an Aragorn prototype of a king without his kingdom but he quickly stands out as an ambitious focused individual who doesn't mind breaking a few necks to get his kingdom back, him under the influence of the dragoncurse is an interesting angle as well. Sir Ian McKellan as Gandalf has always been a fan favorite and he is impeccable as Gandalf in the final movie of the saga. Sir Christopher Lee as Saruman has always been the unsung hero of the series his booming voice is in all its glory even at such a late stage in his life. Hugo Weaving and Cate Blanchett aptly portray their old roles.As far as criticsim of the movie goes there is quite a few of them, rest of the dwarfs are forgettable, Bard is such a boring character (they had three movies to develop this guy and he still his character can't match Boromir who was introduced half way into the fellowship), some terrible and unnecessary romance between a dwarf and an elf, some really bad cgi action scenes and finally, weak female characters with some terrible acting by Evangeline Lily. However don't let this deter you from watching this film, it hits some great emotional highs and I nerded out when at the end of the film Thandruil told Legolas to search for a certain Dunedain ranger who goes by the name of Strider, the film is filled with such small easter eggs for the fan of the series and the last shot in which we see an old Bilbo Baggins hearing Gandalf's knock on his door which starts the events of the Fellowship of the ring is perhaps the best end I could have hoped for, it was beautiful. I would love to own the entire Hobbit trilogy extended edition because this film was clearly butchered to adhere to studio runtime (especially Saruman angle), it would look good beside my original LOTR extended edition.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Unecessary epilogue haphazardly slapped together. Only 10 minutes could be salvaged.,"Over-bloated, disappointing finale to Peter Jackson's Middle-Earth.

Another wonderful immersion into the rich world of a Tolkien masterpiece,"The same sweeping, majestic and graphically rich shots of mythical beings running through beautiful snow covered mountain landscapes we have come to expect from Jackson. This includes, of course, the ingeniously realistic CGI that brings Middle Earth to life once more.Im too hazy on the book to say how true it is to Tolkiens imagining, but I felt it was a fitting and worthy end to the film Trilogy. It's also great to see that it tied in well with the first Lord of the Rings movie, although some resolutions were left for you to ponder (or read the book).It was unfortunately let down by poor, Xena style extras and wooden acting at pivotal and powerful moments, which was a shame because the leading roles were done very well, with the ever regal Ian McKellen as Gandalf and a solid Martin Freeman as Bilbo.Greed and the lust for power are strong themes here and though at times seem a bit over the top are a sobering reflection on the world in which we live. On the other hand, friendship, respect, love and honour are also very present and celebrated.Another wonderful immersion into the rich world of a Tolkien masterpiece.slickreviews.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Highly Recommended Great Movie,"The Biggest question for this Movie is does it Live up to Peter Jackson's Brilliant cinematography reputation or will this movie be disheartening for us Middle Earth Admirers? Well, I can honestly admit that I walked out of the cinema blown away by the effects and the conclusion to this wonderful book and movie The Hobbit. Though the book and movie were very different due to the added scenes that weren't written in the book, like the scenes, that helped complete the movie and create romance and drama that brought this movie to the modern era of viewers, but I can tell you the scenes added won't disappoint you. By how the movie turned out compared to Tolkien's wonderful book it is a credit to Peter Jackson for cramming such a great book in just 3-4 hours because viewers will get bored but he did the best he could to fit all of the book in. While The Anticipation For this movie was tremendous because you have to wait a year between the Desolation of Smaug To Battle of Five Armies, as their was lots of pressure to Peter Jackson to make the conclusion live up to the movies potential that the viewers would like to make a box office hit and a movie to remember with fans and it is a movie to remember for years to come like the Lord of the Rings trilogy.I strongly believe that all of the cast played their role very well and Martin Freeman was perfect for the role of Bilbo Baggins, He showed a reluctant warrior (or Burglar) that persisted and showed courage to get the dwarfs back to their home. From start to finish this movie is full of action drama with a dose of romance which leads to a conclusion to a great story which will be know to the next generation of Middle Earth Enthusiasts.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good... but What Happened to Jackson's Skills?,"I understand fans that fanatically liked or disliked the film. The film carried some new good stuff, and yet lacked so much greatness and potential that Peter Jackson has always put in his films. WHAT HAPPENED?I had read reviews thinking that people were being picky about the movie, yet as a person that still enjoyed the movie, I couldn't help but ask, did Peter Jackson stop caring during the film? It had all the tools as well as help from some good cast. If your going to put romance then you really have to establish the connection. I felt like Fili and Tauriel were dating for sometime right when they started throwing at each other. The screen time between the battles and unnecessary Wilfred scenes kind of make me cringe. What a waste. Fili and Kili's deaths were sad but they weren't as emotional as they should have been. Peter Jackson failed to make these characters death momentus. Boromir's death was able to look tragic despite being an unlikable character throughout 95 percent of the film. Yet his death was 10 times more important and tragic than Kili and Fili. And I say that regrettably. During serious moments, I really felt Peter Jackson was either hesitant to set the mood or just didn't bother caring. The sad scenes and dramatic scenes had terrible background tunes. It made the audience unsympathetic to these scenes.Even though the battle scenes were pretty good, they still seemed to lack... a lot... and its noticeable. The beginning of the battle is the biggest scene really. After that there's very few good battle scenes. It brings up the question of whether Peter Jackson decided to cut funding. The final battle between Thorin and Agog isn't very dramatic. It was okay, but with all the tragic deaths of Lord of the Rings, this did not come close. We had Boromir's Death, and Theoden's that had their sad and honorable endings, and as a king Thorin really should have had that moment better. No funeral? Very interesting. Again, with the duel between Thorin and Azog and the lack of a true ending for the characters we have been on a journey with for three movies, you wonder if they looked at their bank account and just said... heck with it.Okay movie, but you have to ask with the lack of, whether Peter Jackson made the movie in such a way to just kill the series. Its very tragic as especially with the movies this year, it could have really made a big noise in the Academy Awards.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fabulous film trilogy.,"First of all I'd like to say I didn't see any of the Hobbit films in the cinema. I've just recently sat down & watched all 3 on blu ray on my big TV. Secondly I was aware of all the mixed reviews they all got so I was expecting to be disappointed if I'm honest. Thirdly & most importantly I've never cared what others like, Its what I like that matters to me. That's why we have menus in restaurants.. we all have different tastes. A critics review in a paper is meaningless, its like a food critic saying Cumberland pie isn't good when millions like it. Fourthly now we have established criticism is a personal rant.. how can we tell how good a movie or series is. Money of course.. over 3 billion dollars the last I heard in cinema & DVD sales. Personally,I loved all 3 Hobbit films, I thought they were really fabulous. I'm not gonna sound like an art house nerd here dissecting every frame as if I were writing a doctoral thesis. I simply enjoyed each film, right from the start I could see how much love, thought & care went into each frame. The cinema photography was stunning..my big TV has never looked so handsome. Some of the finest scenes I have seen. The films were well balanced & had plenty drama & excitement in them, perfectly woven throughout. Yes it was not as enjoyable as the LOTR trilogy but there are not many films out there that are if you ask me. The LOTR book is a much better read than The Hobbit so in a way its fitting the films are the same. There was a much better musical score in the LOTR which accompanied more emotional melancholy scenes.. that's what I thought was lacking in the Hobbit. (Was Enya on holiday or something lol)Saying that, scene for scene The Hobbits cinema photography & CGI were superior. Scenes with Smaug in the 2nd film were just stunning. Well done Peter Jackson, the films were great. You will be laughing all the way to the bank.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fans of this series will watch it regardless, those that aren't won't. My son loved it, I thought it was OK.","""This was the last move in a master plan. A plan long in the making."" After the dragon comes down from the mountain and is defeated the armies of darkness rise. Sides are chosen and armies are formed. Bilbo (Freeman) tries to settle things down, but its not as easy as he hoped it would be. This is a movie that is review proof.

As for me, I have watched all of them, but never was really interested in them. My son loves them, and he was actually the one that was filling me in on what happened in the last few movies.

A little anticlimactic,"This movie didn't really work as a stand alone movie: it's just the final act in a saga that was obviously stretched out too much. As a third of a two movie Hobbit saga it would have been a much different thing. As a movie in and of itself, it's just too drawn out. Add to that the fact that we have now seen 12+ hours of elves, orcs & trolls fighting each other, it was unsurprising. Though beautifully shot, with great effects, and the cast & characters arguably more likable than the Lord of the Rings saga, it has good things going for it, but ultimately this third Hobbit movie is probably the weakest of both JRR Tolkien / Peter Jackson sagas.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
There's nothing to not like about this film,"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies (2014) is a movie in my DVD collection that my daughter and I recently watched on Amazon Prime. The storyline picks up with the dragon, Smaug, outside the mountain and attacking the humans in the town below. The humans put up a good fight with an archer hero being the only chance against the dragon. Meanwhile, a legion of orcs are heading to the mountain and human town. The elves also have a claim to be made and are heading to the mountain also. The gold in the mountain is twisting the dwarves minds and causing them to be selfish in the face of all this chaos. Can a Hobbit help set things right before the dragon and/or orcs take over Middle Earth?This movie is directed by Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings) and stars Ian McKellen (Gods and Monsters), Martin Freeman (Black Panther), Cate Blanchett (Elizabeth), Orlando Bloom (Pirates of the Caribbean), Richard Armitage (The Lodge) and Graham McTavish (Rambo).This is easily the best film in the Hobbit trilogy and is one of the top films in Peter Jackson's Middle Earth series. The war and action scenes in this are absolutely out of this world and the use of animals in those scenes (elks, pigs, eagles, etc) is tremendous. Every scene Bloom is in is entertaining. The CGI for the land, creatures, war scenes, dragons etc is just so good and captures the imagination. There's a fight scene on the ice that is very well done and gets your anxiety going. The showdown between the humans and dragon is outstanding and it is fun to watch the dynamics between each race on Middle Earth. There was a smart twist to prevent the elves from going to war that was well written and the ending is both sad and fulfilling.Overall, there's nothing to not like about this film. This is a perfect way to end the Middle Earth pictures and I would score this an easy 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Probably the best of the bunch,"I was a huge fan of 'The Lord of the Rings' movies and, for once, I actually read all the books when I was young â€“ including the 'prequel' â€“ the Hobbit. Therefore, I was always looking forward to the Hobbit movies. And, I think I was pleased â€“ somewhere. The first two films were just long. We all knew that because The Hobbit was a small book, split into three looooong movies. Even though I've seen both previous instalments, I can't actually remember much about either of them. There were a couple of memorable moments, but, in between Parts II and III, I've managed to pretty much forget almost everything I'd seen (apart from the fact that there were too many CGI scenes and situations where the heroes could never survived!).However, here we have 'Part III' and, in my opinion, it is a bit better. Granted, most of the movie is one loooong battle scene. It's like the 'Helm's Deep' battle from Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, only stretched out for the entire film. Yes, there was as much computer-generated stuff, but it felt slightly more polished than its predecessors. I never really went for the CGI in any of the Hobbit movies. Even though they've been made over ten years after the Lord of the Rings trilogy ended, the CGI seems to have gotten worse over the years.Even though there was probably the least story in this film, it actually came off as the best â€“ or most realistic. There were no ridiculous barrel-chases crashing down rivers, or gaggles of dwarfs bouncing down mineshafts and just getting up again without a scratch.Once again, the titular Hobbit (played â€“ again â€“ excellently by Martin Freeman) is not in it enough, despite the film being named after him. Instead, the film focuses on characters who have been shoved in to pad it out, or the ones we just don't care that much about.Maybe the best thing about The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, was it was actually the last one in the series and had a sense of resolution about it.Bottom line: I loved the Lord of the Rings films and I loved the Hobbit novel. I sort of enjoyed the first two movies, but definitely need to watch them again as I can hardly remember anything about them. At least this last one seems to have stuck in my mind a bit more and I don't reckon that I'll need to re-watch it quite so soon to remember what's happened. Yeah, it held my attention more than the others.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Abomination of Tolkien's Work,"Where do Peter Jackson go wrong? He took all the great things in the LOTR trilogy and then canned them. Far too much emphasis on plot devices and set pieces and little on narrative. The Hobbit is one of the great literature pieces of the 20th Century and to see it disassembled and regurgitated in this manner is shameless. The retelling of the story is disrespectful to the original with a bit of added on arrogance - Jackson obviously sees himself as a better storyteller than Tolkien regardless of the medium.

"Good movie, but...","When I watched The Fellowship of the Ring, I felt in love with the atmosphere of the Shire, a mix of comfort, beauty and simplicity. I had just finished the Lord of the Rings trilogy of Tolkien and Jackson seemed to have understood the wonderful world which Tolkien created. Then, the epic quest of the Ring began and never had enough and watched many times the extended editions.Some years later, the adventures of Bilbo the hobbit were going in cinema. When I learned it would be three movies, it seemed really strange, but I gave it a shot. Since the first movie went out, I was disappointed. The hobbit is one of my favorite book : it is charming, simple and it is an incredible adventure. But I never had the feeling of adventure which I link with the Hobbit. I found the first two movies were very good, but it was missing some ingredients. The last movie was a bigger disappointment. The first half was good, but after that, it was just battles after battles, with a supersonic Legolas and a Super Saiyan Galadrielle, with bosses which seemed to be created for video games. But the feeling of adventure was absent, and it ruined the movie for me.In the Hobbit, the charm of the book, which is not reflected in the movies (particularly the third one) can be resumed with the end :"" ""Of course!"" said Gandalf [...] ""You are a very fine person, Mr. Baggins and I am very fond of you; but you are only quite a little follow in a wide world after all"" ""Thank goodness!"" said Bilbo laughing, and handed him the tobacco-jar"".",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
one big long fight,"The main problem with this movie is that it seemed like one big, long fight. There wasn't much of a plot, just a lot of computer effects that start to get boring and ""armies"" going at one another. The Ring hardly has a presence in this film; it should have been used more. The dragon dies in the first 10 minutes and then for some unknown reason, Thorin gets all the gold and the townspeople get none. How come? Thorin didn't rescue the city. And what did the elf King have to do with anything. He helps rescue Gandolph then disappears. There was just too many things like that.FINAL VERDICT: Perhaps the worst of the franchise.

It all ends here. For better or worse,"With Erebor back in the hands of the king, Smaug(Cumberbatch, snake-like) taking out his fury on Laketown which leaves the inhabitants as refugees, the gold and area are claimed, to varying extent, by various groups who may not agree, and a legion of Orcs on the way, the titular five armies will have to either fight each other, or band together against a common threat.This resolves everything in the trilogy, and is smoother in doing so than Return, albeit that is in part because there is less to deal with. Ultimately, while some of us prefer the darker tone of this to the more child-friendly novel(which this follows quite nicely), this should not have tried to connect itself so tightly to The Lord of the Rings. Never reaching Star Wars prequel levels, this does go out of its way to simultaneously set up, and not dig too deeply into, where this leaves off and that picks it back up.A lot is done with what was built up in these three. Strong male bonding, in particular the dynamic relationship between Bilbo(Freeman, awkward and homesick, yet still proving himself a hero, and utilizes his skills and wit to help solve the conflict) and Thorin(Armitage, obsessed with his newly found wealth, yet beneath, maybe still honorable). Will old enemies be able to settle their differences? Have some steps been taken that cannot be undone? Will everyone have a place to call home, and a future?The climax is an awful lot of fun, and you can tell Jackson has been missing doing vast battle scenes between several sides each with hundreds of organized forces, and that, apparently, this will be his last chance to do so. It does end up too long, extending, well, padding, the shortest of these since it was decided there would be more than two in this series. There's room for fan-service, new creatures and settings, and for not only endangering the people we came to see and also their loved ones but then letting some of them disappear into the background. At its best, there is drama, it's poignant, and satisfying. This is not always the case here.There is moderate(pushing PG-13, as has been done lately) violence and disturbing content in this. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the J.R.R. Tolkien Middle Earth epics. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The journey comes to an end (or a start),"It's probably fair to say that the Hobbit trilogy hasn't ever reached the heights of the Rings trilogy. There's no doubt that there are a number of reasons for this. The awe of the visuals on the Rings movies is just as impressive in the Hobbit movies, but it is no longer original. There was also a lot more source material in the Rings books than the Hobbit book.The final part of the Hobbit trilogy is action all the way and starts (not unsurprisingly) from where the previous film finished. Don't go and see the Five Armies without seeing (or at least knowing about) the previous Hobbit films.You probably have the greatest interest in the Hobbit movies when the scenes are related to plot lines of the Rings movies. That's definitely the case with me and consequently I love the final scene of the movie. Martin Freeman is fine in the lead role of Bilbo although you never quite get the sense of joy that you got from the Rings cast. The Five Armies is definitely the best of the Hobbit movies and is definitely worth a watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

MY REVIEW: Middle Earth Saga Ends and Ends Well!!,"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies. The master of his craft, Peter Jackson bring the finale of the Hobbit trilogy and as expected, he stuns with his command on visuals, cinematography and creation of memorable characters and action set-pieces.Movie starts right in the middle of action where last movie's star Smaug the dragon is furious and firing all over the city. As movie moves forward, the danger keeps on rising and you are well treated with slick one hour long CGI based detailed battle of the five armies. This is shortest and most action oriented movie among all middle earth movies so there is not a single dull moment.You might find it underwhelming when compared to LOTR trilogy but it is still a satisfying finale. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for The Hobbit 3.

The last goodbye.,"I cannot judge this film on its own merits alone. It is a mere part of a marvelous whole, one that I grew up with and one that will forever hold a fond place in my memory.People will say that it is the weakest of Peter Jackson's Tolkien adaptations and they are probably right. I will not waste my time defending it. I'll merely claim that, despite it's flaws, it has more than enough to keep one's attention and to entertain for a mere three hours. More importantly, it is closure, an ending to a good story and, beyond that, to a series of films which more than deserve our respect and admiration. As such, I think that it is recommended viewing to anyone who bothered with the first five and I foresee that only the most critical among us shall leave wholly unsatisfied.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Not without its flaws but still serves as a great sendoff to the middle earth saga.,"So here we are, the last we'll see of middle earth on the big screen. Being a major fan of LOTR trilogy and having liked the previous two Hobbit films, the feels of goodbye was indeed high when watching this film, not to mention there were some really emotional scenes in the movie.It picks up exactly where the last film left off, with Smaug flying to Laketown. I gotta say, it was one hell of an opening sequence. Then the story boils down to a slow paced conflict with the impending battle owing to the film's name slowly coming closer. Almost all of the second half of the film involves the battle and events in it. The movie had some really spectacular scenes, my favorite being rescue of Gandalf. That scene was filled with awesomeness.Performances from the main characters were yet again great while many of the rest were a mixed bag. Martin Freeman(Bilbo) and Richard Armitage (Thorin) really carried the film emotionally with their great performance.All was not well I'm afraid, the stretching of the source material is yet again glaringly apparent just like the last part. Lots of filler content, which, for the most part, just hampers the pacing and isn't interesting enough. The pointless love triangle was again pointless and dragged on. The 2 hour and 20 min runtime could have been shaved a lot to remove such extra stuff, I don't know why Peter Jackson insists these movies should be long when the source material itself is limited unlike LOTR.Also, the overuse of CGI again was an issue. It is not that the CGI itself was bad as some stuff looked great, it is that they didn't used it well, like they lazily implemented it all. You can't expect to throw everything at the screen and expect it to look good. Lots of areas had fakey feeling and you could tell that green screen was used etc. This issue has been persistent in this trilogy.The battle of the five armies was a long ass sequence but even with all the new tech and story material at hand (Five armies, DAMN), it didn't had THE FEEL of battles from LOTR, especially since the accompanying soundtrack is nowhere near as good. The claim that it will be the biggest and best battle done yet by the creators clearly falls short.Despite its many shortcomings, it was an entertaining ride with some great scenes and serves as a sendoff to this middle earth saga. The tie-ins with LOTR were great. Now, I can watch all of them in sequence, Hobbit trilogy first, then LOTR. A MEGA MIDDLE EARTH MARATHON.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Flawed, but wonder and awe-inspiring.","I saw this film in IMAX 3D HFR format.Some people are never satisfied. Granted, there's not a single one of Peter Jackson's six Tolkein adaptations that isn't in some way flawed. To listen to some talk about the Hobbit films you'd think, however, that he was guilty of mass murder of at least the Transformer films. I remain convinced that from the perspective of history this set of six will be widely-loved and cherished. Frankly I want him to keep making films like this for the rest of my life.If the first Hobbit was a film that spoke to me of grace and the second was one that spoke to me of joy, then this third instalment induces in me somewhere between childlike wonder and awe. Like the rest of this trilogy, it's too little narrative stretched over too much screen time. Like The Return Of The King the large-scale battle sections overwhelm character and nuance. Like all the other films, Orlando Bloom is still phoning it in. Unlike the 3rd LOTR film, this one decides that one ending will suffice, and it's a beautiful, funny and entirely apt ending that moved me to a slightly moistened eye behind my annoying 3D glasses.Like the other films, and true to Jackson's film-making roots, there's some tough stuff in here. Picking up right where the previous film left off, it opens with Smaug laying waste to the nearby city; the attendant action scenes are fantastic, and the footage of ordinary people turned to refugees in fearful panic is chilling and contemporary. There then, essentially, follows a series of sequences of various characters being foreboding about oncoming war, plus a little sneaking around and double-dealing. Richard Armitage as dwarf king Thorin takes centre stage wrestling with 'gold sickness' as much as Frodo will later wrestle with the Ring's power and temptations. It doesn't quite have the Ring's chilling relevance but it's powerful stuff nonetheless and still a fine performance.It's all marking time, to be honest, for the titular battle. A masterfully presented battle it is too. There's a few moments where there's too much CGI (Legolas running up some falling bricks sticks in the memory in a bad way); other than that, it's stunning. There are five armies, and for us to be fully involved in personal skirmishes as well as large scale conflict and still be able to keep a handle on the story and who is fighting who and why is no small achievement. There are moments of liquid beauty too - elf armies aligning, especially; and some truly memorable weapons and creatures ... a large troll-thing with a stone thing round his head being a funny but still powerful highlight.As mentioned, occasionally the computer imagery takes over too much, which is an unusual fault in these films. Mostly the human wins through, but here the artifice is occasionally too obvious. For me this was exacerbated by the artificiality of HFR; all be it that IMAX remains the best format for large-scale films like this. By movie's, however, it was only my diary and the late hour keeping me from diving straight into the LOTR trilogy.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A good but not great end to the Middle Earth saga,"It's been emotional. After 6 films, we presumably leave Middle Earth for good. However, while The Lord Of The Rings is the best trilogy of all time, after 3 exhausting prequels I think that's for the best. The first Hobbit film is a long slog punctuated by some exciting adventure sequences, while the second overcompensates with loads of big set pieces. This one is half character study, half epic battle. I'm not the biggest fan of the Hobbit films although I respect certain aspects of them. Battle Of The Five Armies is a good conclusion, although the second film is better. It's still too long and suffers from pacing problems, likely as a result of the blatant padding out of the source material. While the drama in the original trilogy felt well rounded and real, here some of the dramatic stuff such as Thorin's character arc is only powerful some of the time, while at other times feels constructed from clichÃ©s. There is definitely a sense that 2 films would have been absolutely fine.BATFA is weighed down by a going the motions script, but some of the character deaths are still emotional. Special effects are mind blowing as usual, and few can film chaotic fantasy action as well as Peter Jackson. The film is desperate to get to the event of the title, but it delivers on the orc smashing, barn storming, scenery destroying, blazing battle we were all expecting. Other elements are neglected, but that doesn't harm the film. It finds just enough emotion to anchor the sweeping spectacle, and therefore this tale is an emotional one as well as a thrilling one. It's a poignant farewell to Middle Earth, and this time at least it doesn't take 45 minutes to end. The first half is slightly slow, but the second half delivers on the promise of the story. A good send off overall, though not a great one. The acting also elevates it. Ian McKellen isn't as striking as he was before, but Richard Armitage and Martin Freeman are great and Orlando Bloom manages to get away with his lack of acting ability. Despite its flaws, BATFA ends the trilogy on a high note.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The epic and emotional conclusion to Peter Jackson's Middle Earth,"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is the finale in the trilogy of Hobbit films and most likely Peter Jacksons final visit to Middle Earth, and boy does he go out with a bang. The film picks up from where The Desolation of Smaug ended and from that moment you know that this film is going for all out action. Over half of this films runtime is filled with what we loved the most from the Lord of the Rings trilogy; the battles. The fast pace and epic battles are what make this film so brilliant. From the enormous size of a single dragon to the epic spectacle of thousands of warriors all going against each other, this war of The Lonely Mountain was the real star of the film.And in saying this it leads to one of the minor downsides of the film, and that is that for the first half of the film Bilbo Baggins aka 'The Hobbit' is almost like a supporting character to many others. It is a minor detail but he didn't get enough screen time i felt over the course of the whole film. Despite the screen time he had, he still received a lot of character development, and along with Thorin were the only two characters who really developed throughout the film. Even though this film was shorter then the previous two hobbit films i do feel that around 20 minutes could have been cut out in the middle of the film where the pace noticeably slowed down to keep with the fast pace of the film. But these issues didn't take too much away from my enjoyment of the film as the fast paced epic battles along with the ties to The Lord of the Rings give a fitting conclusion to this trilogy of films. - 8.8",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Visuals From Someone Who Wants To Move On,"Though ""The Return Of The King"" was a fitting conclusion to an immensely satisfying trilogy, it left you wanting more (what with ""The Hobbit"" begging to be filmed). ""The Battle Of The Five Armies"" is also a fitting conclusion, though ""The Hobbit"" trilogy itself has not been nearly as memorable, and the director, the estimable Peter Jackson, seems more than ready to let go of his creation and move on to new challenges. Still, Jackson throws himself into the finale with a lot more energy than you would expect he could muster at this point and of the three ""Hobbit"" films, this one is the best. Although the emphasis on battle seems like filler, it's more interesting filler than the filler the two previous films reeked of--the plot is almost given short shrift in favor of the magnificently filmed action scenes. The ""Hobbit"" actors have overall left much less of an impression than the ""Lord Of The Rings"" performers (indeed, the film's best scene involves holdovers Christopher Lee, Cate Blanchett and Ian McKellan as well as the image of Sauron) but here it makes it easier to give yourself up to the kinetic sensuality that the film is constantly pushing you towards; the battles fill you with more emotion than the narrative does. As good and as much fun as it is, though, it will eventually join the previous two films and fade in the collective memory--whereas its predecessors' place is assured.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The end of an imperfect epic,"(66%) The very last chapter of this middle-earth based saga is one of mixed emotions. On the one hand it was nice to get a second bite of the cherry and have the likes of the greatness of McKellen's Gandalf, the charm and detail of the characters and locations, along the impressive action adventure of it all back again; but on the other this clearly shouldn't have been split into three long movies, as there is an even better two chapter movie swamped in there somewhere. Issues of the over use of CGI also hamper the series as it feels too much like a technical showcase, or a video game, with the decision of making the orcs almost entirely computer based being the more questionable and wrong footed. This though is still very much something worth a watch. Martin Freeman, despite him playing second fiddle in his own movie, is great; the action is plentiful without becoming overblown, and the ending is an almost perfect, funny conclusion. Now Mr Jackson, please make a gory horror movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Solid,"As a huge fan of The Lord of the rings and the first 2 hobbit films I was slightly disappointed by this film but still a very good film defiantly worth watching. Martin Freeman and Ian McKellen are both still awesome in their roles as Bilbo and Gandalf as expected. Richard Armatidge also very effectively shows Thorins descent into madness and Legolas is still a badass, however there was one character that was completely overdone and I feel had no place in the movie, this was the masters assistant Alfrid, he was the main problem with this film. The battle scenes where great and epic but slightly over the top and forced at times especially the CGI trolls and I think the battles would have been slightly better without them. The ending scene to this film in my opinion was spectacular and beautifully done Sad to see middle earth go Overall a good final send of to middle earth with mostly good performances and characters, but not quite on par with the other middle earth films",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I wept and said goodbye to an amazing adventure,"First, I don't like 3D movies. Second, I never stay through the credits.That being said, this movie is the Apex of the 3 Hobbit movies. I inadvertently purchased 3D tickets to the final chapter dreaded the thought once the film started and completely forgot about the 3D factor once the opening scene kicked into gear. When it was over, I wept silently. I stayed through the final credits wondering to myself if there will ever be another chain done so eloquently.Granted I do have biased view due to my own journey over the last 16 years running parallel in many ways to both series of the Tolkien's books and Jackson's movies. It is true, you can never go back. And if you do somehow make it back to where you were before you started, nothing will ever be the same, especially yourself.All that needs to be said is that you need to see this in theaters. I understand that there are purest that have a problem with some of the additions that weren't in the book. However, this is an incredible movie and finishes so completely that you will return home to begin the Lord of the Rings all over again.Please go see this movie in the theater, not for numbers or sales, but for yourself.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The aftermath of The Hobbit....,"Last year,when I reviewed Desolation of Smaug, I pointed out the possibilities that they can include on the next one. Those were: ""A dragon who wants to destroy the fisherman village, a man who waits for the dragon with a black arrow, an elf-dwarf love story, an elf who chases an orc who may be will find a pale one too, a forwarding army of orcs, and a wizard in cage.""Well, most of them was indeed in the movie, with some good and bad elements. First of all, Battle Of Five Armies is a shadow of Return of The King. There are precisely five armies, slicing and hammering each other. Had to say, the fight sequences were awesome. Before that, there was Thorin Okenshield playing Humphrey Bogart from Treasure Of Sierra Madre.Overall, the Hobbit series was a leftover of the Lord Of The Ring series, and as per the previous ones' standard, this one is a fitting conclusion. Still, it gave us the best hobbit ever put on screen, gave us some ravishing visuals. So don't be so hard on it....",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
My Star Wars Prequels.,"While it is certainly not as bad as Lucas' attempt to cash in on his franchise, this trilogy has left me with a comparable bad after taste. This movie in particular ties off the trilogy as an unnecessary studio- executive-driven project.What was this movie about? Who was the protagonist? who was the villain? Is Thorin's greed enough of an excuse for the whole two hour film?This film was bafflingly bad for me. The dialogues are especially ridiculous, but the plot is also right there at the top. I sincerely don't know what the writers were thinking.Visually impressive, except on the occasions where it isn't, (Legolas jumping on a collapsing stone bridge certainly was a B movie level stunt)I'm not going further into this, because from today I start trying to forget that this Prequel exists, just like that other one.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The end of an ultimately unwelcome return to Middle Earth,"The Hobbit Trilogy really has been blighted by the additional content added in, and it's ironic that these moments have come at the cost of vital sections of the book. It's even more ironic considering that many story lines that have fabricated/added to the story of their own creation are not resolved.To say that ""wait for the extended edition to judge how well it closes its story"" is nonsense this book has already been super sized to three films, the fact Peter Jackson has managed to release extended editions for each of his Hobbit films astounds me.Certain set pieces are given a build up and just left dangling in the air. When you walk out of the cinema you actually realise a lot has been cut out of the film when reflecting on what you have seen.Whereas The Lord of the Rings Trilogy took to blending all forms of film making (physical props, miniatures, CGI, etc), The Hobbit has placed an overbearing of CGI. This dulls the spectacle and during the film I actually realised what I am watching is 70/30 animated CGI and live action respectively. This is jarring and is one of the few times I have found CGI getting in the way of the story the film is trying to get across.Jackson's exuberance on building upon Tolkien's story and relying so heavily on CGI has hindered what truly made his LOTRs Trilogy a pinnacle in storytelling. Whereas The Hobbit could not provide material for 3 films, the LOTRs books have plentiful and a lot of the book has been cut out in the film adaption even when considering the extended editions. That is the main issue here - and a trilogy that is rife with filler has really hindered The Hobbit Trilogy and the titular character, in my opinion, has not been given the spotlight throughout the Trilogy and this film in particular.Jackson has managed to steer this away from catastrophe territory (a la George Lucas with the Prequels) into ""meh it's OK"" territory. I feel this trilogy could be cut down to 4 hours and would produce a far superior film.Although I reference The Trilogy of The Hobbit as a whole in my review the same flaws which runs through the first two instalments are even more present and prevalent in this instalment - for two films I have been tolerant but the issues have now overstayed their welcome and I'm glad The Silmarilion movie rights are unavailable to anyone as it will prevent the gloss from the movies 11-14 years prior being dulled and tainted even further.I was the target age for this Hobbit series when LOTR came out and even I can see the drop in quality, this is a question of aesthetic - which Jackson changed for the Hobbit and he has forgotten what made his original trilogy so special.... Much like the Original Trilogy and the Prequel Trilogy of the Star Wars saga.I believe that the comments Viggo Mortensen made against The Hobbit films and Peter Jackson are valid after seeing these three films.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"It works, but that's about it","Once again we return to Middle-Earth, this time to bid our farewells for now. The final Hobbit film improves upon the its immediate predecessor by focusing on the battle scenes and leaving much of the silliness out, but by now we've grown weary of the formula and this film doesn't quite reach the atmosphere and mood of the first Hobbit film, let alone the grandeur of The Lord of the Rings trilogy.I truly think Peter Jackson tried too hard to reach the golden middle road with this trilogy. This final installment being no exception. We do get the grand battles and splendid visuals that appeal to the fans of the original trilogy, but we also get dwarfs riding battle boars and speaking with funny Scottish accents, which probably appeals to those that liked he lighthearted tone of the original book. The first film managed to juggle these two contrasting tones, at least as long as the story stayed in Shire, where there is a place for lightheartedness yet somber conversations can happen by the fire. But now Erebor has been retaken and war is brewing on the horizon. I don't think we need battle boars or Legolas doing stunts that would be more at home in an anime. And yes, The Return of the King had similar problems, which is why it's the weakest of the original trilogy. But it didn't do it to this extent.That being said, this is substantially less ridiculous than The Desolation of Smaug, which is a huge plus in the movie's favour. When it's time for battle, the battles are suitably epic and great to look at. And when the characters need to be serious, they can be and you feel bad because the odds are stacked heavily against them. I'm also grateful that Jackson decided to stick to the original ending. I sort of knew he wouldn't be that much a sellout, but the second movie had seriously shaken my resolve. Sorry for doubting you, Peter.I also still like the additions from Tolkien's other works, such as Unfinished Tales, dealing with the White Council. They're cinematic beyond all believe and neatly tie the two trilogies together. No complaints from me, though I know some people don't like them at all.As a whole I'm glad this movie and the whole trilogy exist. They're still great films and they suffer only by being compared to the original trilogy, which has become one of the cornerstones of fantasy film genre. The Hobbit films have their flaws, but it's still Middle-Earth and I'd watch these over most other films there are.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Proper LOTR stuff.,"I have just finished reading The Hobbit and while Jackson clearly used some filler to bulk out the films to stretch them to a trilogy, at least he didn't inject his own politics into the show.At least we will always have the Peter Jackson films. Its a bit like Star Wars...I wonder if they will ever release an episode 7...(Rey never happened). Despite criticism saying these films are nothing like the books - that isn't true. It even included bits like the trolls and Bilbo's things being sold.Overall a solid entry and the last proper LOTR's film. Anything after this (mentioning no names) will never compare.

Great action but too long,"At least some of the magic of Lord of the Rings series is recaptured in the final of the Hobbit trilogy but its length meant we were in the cinema nearly three hours. At least 30 minutes of forbidden elf-dwarf love and weeping over dying dwarfs could have quite easily been edited out, and it would have been a better movie for it. No doubt Peter Jackson was told, ""Yes, its awful, but we Have to Appeal to a Female Audience"". Which is why the last two Hobbit movies are stuffed with Hollywood schlock. And there is some serious miscasting of the characters involved in the elf-dwarf love sub-plot, which left me totally unconvinced. And was it really necessary to kill so many characters> And what was with those worms anyway? If the producers had stuck more to the book and not tried to pad it out with silly love stories what is merely an interesting movie could have been a classic.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
LOTR vs The Hobbit,"I feel many user reviews have been unfair to Jackson as they seem to summarily dismiss the Hobbit series altogether as one monumental redundancy. I've watched both the LOTR trilogy and The Hobbit series with equal delight, but I loved the latter more.I found the premise of LOTR too abstract and surreal giving a hint to the over imaginative mind of Tolkien. I felt the same with Rowling after the sixth part of Harry Potter was out. 
It seems painfully fantastic. What with the sinistrously powerful ring which is hell bent on reaching its benevolent master, the hideous eye constantly guarding Mordor, and poor Frodo constantly overwhelmed and under prepared for the herculean task he has undertaken, his life tottering on the brink of his grave- the film gets altogether depressing as it progresses and ends with a rather predictable climax. The final part is a whopping four hour long of ass numbing misery. I just wanted it to end. Even the Orcs in LOTR are predictable and stupid. Like petty toy soldiers they are prolific in numbers but lacking in wit, fighting other people's battle unlike in Hobbit where they appear sinistrously ghastly and macabre. They also had a leader with brains.Hobbit is beautifully directed in three parts. First is a nail biting adventure which keeps you hooked throughout. In the second, we've the inimitable Benedict Cumberbatch playing Smaug, the most fearsome dragon, who is nothing short of being brilliant, and in the final part we get to see the Dwarf King Thorin Oakenshield played by the versatile Richard Armitage in his full element. The scene where the dwarves decide to join in on the battle is a classic. It pumps my adrenaline everytime I see it. ""Will you follow me for the one last time?""Since I watched the Hobbit first, I missed terribly the presence of dwarves in LOTR although Gimli was brilliant.Battle of the five armies is a pure nail biter. It moves with a swift thrilling pace, and is definitely not clichÃ©d. Technically, it precedes LOTR, and however much Jackson may have experimented with the adaptation, it all unfolds wonderfully making it an instant classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Lack of detail leads to two different opinions pronto,"As an avid fan of fantasy genre, I am fond of a fierce one-on-one combat, fighting neck and neck to the hilt. Not to mention the massive and fast-paced brawl that consists of jumbled armies scuffling with their spearheads leading the way. Thus I give this final film of the ""Hobbit"" trilogy, seven out of ten for captivating and scrambling sequences. However, the score might get reversed by those who are very passionate and keen about Tolkien's LOTR and Hobbit because even I could tell that this movie seems rushed by subliminally negating and compressing all the important events and elements that could have emblazoned the wonderful trilogy that has potential to lure people to buy the Blu-ray of LOTR series in order to complete the whole adventure.It is truly a no-brainer since almost most contexts happen within a specific vicinity along with the duplicated CG armies in the widespread field. The highlight of the movie is surprisingly the emotional love tale between an elf and a dwarf which has its moment to make a lot of female audiences move. Sadly, the number of the characters seem redundant as only a few of them get a spotlight through ample cut scenes, which make them look somewhat underperformed.As the outset kicks off strong with pep and whooshes to the nicely crafted battle scenes that are capable of keeping the audience entertained from various immersive angles and feisty actions that happen on thin ice as both actors and CG creatures are in unison, everyone will find out why the title of this movie is indeed ""The Battle of the Five Armies,"" Although, it is kind of hard to see how every soldier gets knocked out due to a constant camera moving left and right without enough close-ups. Other than that, it is worth watching in 3D and heed when it gets down to the wire.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Unfortunately one of the worst movies I've seen,"In exact opposition of one of the reviews here, I enjoyed the first of the three hobbit movies the most and then desolation of Smaug next. I'm actually watching that one again now! So, I enjoyed the first two - whereas this other reviewer said they were underwhelmed by the first two but loved this one...Anyway, once I got to Five Armies, I was bored most of the way through, it felt like a bunch of zoomed out, CG fight scenes with no real emotion - just a money grab and an easy way to wrap up the story.I love LOTR, Peter Jackson, all that - this could have been as good as Return of the King but it was so far from it. I like most movies I watch and I was really disappointed. When I think back on the hobbit trilogy, I remember the first 2/3 but can't really remember how it ended...a shame",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The ending to the Hobbit but the beginning to The Lord of the Rings,"""So began a battle that none had expected; and it was called The Battle of the Five Armies, and it was very terrible."" -J. R. R. Tolkien, ""The Hobbit"" Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring was released in 2001 and was a huge success. It used computer graphics to blur the line between the ""real"" and the ""imagined"" to create a world of elves, dwarves, dragons and hobbits. This journey began 13 years ago with the unveiling of Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. Back then, the scope and scale of Peter Jackson's visual imagination was breathtaking. Animators like Ralph Bakshi had taken a crack at Tolkien's weighty tomes before, but Jackson was making game-changing use of computer graphics to blur the line between the ""real"" and the ""imagined"". Jackson's vision of Middle-earth was swept away by the sheer cinematic force of his vision. The novel ""The Battle of the Five Armies"" is a concise, humorous, with a dark periphery, and features Bilbo Baggins, a tut-tutting little homebody, wondering how he got involved in all of this nonsense. The film's first mildly humorous moment, a line reading from Martin Freeman, comes almost 40 minutes in, and it highlights the humorlessness of the rest. The attention to detail is breathtaking, but the film feels more like a long drawn-out closing paragraph than a vibrant stand-alone piece of the story. The attention to detail is breathtaking, but the film feels more like a long drawn-out closing paragraph rather than a vibrant stand-alone piece of the story. The Battle of the Five Armies picks up where ""Desolation of Smaug"" left off, with Smaug the dragon descending on Laketown in a blitzkrieg of fire. Bard (Luke Evans) is the natural leader of the refugees, while the Dwarf contingency and Bilbo hole themselves up in the Mountain to protect the treasure. Most of the dwarves are uneasy about Thorin's increasingly paranoid leadership. Christopher Lee and Cate Blanchett return briefly for a psychedelic scene of mortal combat with the ring wraiths, and Gandalf returns from imprisonment to the field of battle. Tauriel the elf (Evangeline Lilly) is not given much to do, except love a dwarf, a big no-no in her world. The love subplot feels so obligatory that it's condescending. The love subplot has nothing to do with the story overall, and the love subplot feels so obligatory that it's practically condescending. Tolkien's work taps into a great universal anxiety: would I be up to a similar task? Jackson's films dig into those questions, and ""The Desolation of Smaug"" is the strongest of the three films, because it never forgets that at the heart of it is a small creature who is overwhelmed by fear and yet must be brave anyway.

"6/10 for the movie, 10/10 for the trilogy","Remember those days when everyone claimed that the LotR trilogy isn't three separate movies but one movie split into three? It might have been true about the original trilogy, but it could not have been truer about the Hobbit.The LotR trilogy, while being shot and produced simultaneously, was actually sourced from three different books which had their own arcs and conclusions to make each part stand out on its own. In terms of movies; each movie had drama, character development and action you would care about. This was an impossible feat with the Hobbit trilogy considering the sparseness/mood of the source material. The result? After the first movies you'll see legions of people decrying it for lack of action until the final few moments. After the third, it's vice versa. For fans of Peter Jackson's vision of Middle-earth, this is in fact great news.See, if you take BoFA as a standalone movie it does have its flaws - - some pretty serious. If you take the Hobbit trilogy as a chance to relive *that* Middle-earth, you'll get exactly the movie experience that you could have hoped for after LotR. For those fans, I'd recommend watching the first two movies like, in the 6 hours preceding the third one's showtime. All the drama, character development from the first two will start resonating with the action found in the final part.Not only the LotR trilogy was a masterpiece, each part of it was a great film on its own.

The Hobbit trilogy has not had the same fate, don't get me wrong I own the two Hobbit films on Blu-Ray. I wanted to have these films in digital format,plus I love audio commentary and all the special features. The part that hurt these films is the ""story"" details that were not in the book were added in. This film the Five Armies, I believe was the weakest, it was very convoluted and some of the visual effects were so unrealistic involving the characters, I shook my head. You will see what I'm talking about when you watch the battle sequences in the film. I probably will go out and buy a Blu-Ray copy of the film to complete the trilogy and watch all those cool special features. I still respect Peter Jackson, no one's careers were hurt during the release of these films, and for the most part the acting was done very well, especially from Martin Freeman.

A Spectacular but Uneven Conclusion to The Hobbit Trilogy,"""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies,"" directed by Peter Jackson, serves as the finale to the Hobbit trilogy. While it delivers on the promise of epic battle sequences and visual spectacle, it struggles to maintain the emotional depth and narrative cohesiveness of its predecessors.Picking up directly after the events of ""The Desolation of Smaug,"" the film centers around the aftermath of Smaug's attack on Lake-town and the ensuing battle for control of the Lonely Mountain and its treasures. The film boasts some of the most impressive and expansive battle sequences in the series, showcasing Peter Jackson's flair for choreographing large-scale action.Martin Freeman's portrayal of Bilbo Baggins remains a high point of the trilogy. His performance brings a much-needed sense of heart and humanity to the midst of grandiose battle scenes. Richard Armitage's Thorin Oakenshield, grappling with dragon-sickness, provides a compelling internal conflict that adds depth to his character's arc.The visual effects are, as expected, top-notch. The depiction of the various armies - dwarves, elves, orcs, and humans - in battle is executed with technical prowess, creating a visually stunning spectacle. The production design and cinematography continue to bring the world of Middle-earth to life with rich detail.However, ""The Battle of the Five Armies"" suffers from a sense of narrative imbalance. The film dedicates a significant portion of its runtime to the battle scenes, which, while impressive, can feel drawn out and at times overwhelming. This emphasis on action comes at the expense of character development and narrative subtlety.New characters introduced in the previous films are given little room to develop, and some plotlines are resolved in ways that may seem rushed or unsatisfying. The emotional resonance that characterized earlier installments, particularly in the relationships between key characters, is not as consistently present.Howard Shore's score provides the emotional underpinning for the film, with themes that capture both the epic scope of the battle and the more intimate moments of character reflection. The music remains one of the consistent strengths of the trilogy.While the film attempts to tie up the narrative threads of both ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" series, some connections feel forced or overly contrived. Fans of the series will appreciate the links to the earlier films, but they can feel like unnecessary additions to those primarily invested in ""The Hobbit"" story.In conclusion, ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" is a visually spectacular film that delivers the action and spectacle it promises. However, it falls short of the narrative depth and emotional impact that made ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy a more universally acclaimed experience. The film earns a respectable 7 out of 10 for its technical achievements and as a fitting, if not flawless, conclusion to the Hobbit trilogy. It will satisfy fans looking for closure and grand spectacle but may leave others longing for the richer storytelling of Jackson's earlier Middle-earth films.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great way to sum up the Series,Peter Jackson did a great job summing up The Hobbit in The Battle of Five Armies. He also did a great job tying the hobbit into Lord of the Rings. There was a lot of great action and battles along with a great story behind it. Out of the three Hobbit movies this is my favorite to watch. I also liked how they added an extra story line in the movies besides just what happens in the book. I was impressed with how great the graphics were in the movie. Even if you have not read the book you would still love the movie. One thing that I believe wasn't needed was the three part series. I think it could have been filmed in two parts and still have been a great movie series. Overall though it was a great movie and I would definitely recommend it to people who love action packed movies and adventure. I also recommend you read the book The Hobbit if you have not done so.,9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The music by Howard Shore added depth to the emotional moments, and the visuals transported me into the world of Tolkien in a captivating way.

Not really sure why Jackson and the other writers wanted to use a whole film to depict one battle. It would be like making the Battle of the Pelennor fields (Lord of the Rings) into an entire film in its own right. Having said that I really enjoyed the film. The battle scenes are quite intense and well done. The sets and creatures are brilliant. In particular the Smaug scenes at the start were particularly good and Richard Armitage's depiction of Thorin Oakenshield is brilliant. Top marks to Luke Evans also for his portrayal of Bard.,8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The battle of 4 Armies and 1 Air Force!!!,Compared with some others I have enjoyed the recent Hobbit trilogy that some fans of the novel have absolutely hated. I'm different though I love the book itself I feel the movies capture more of the Middle Earth that we wanted and showed it well. Although I was initially excited for the 3 part series this one I found was unnecessary even though I absolutely loved the action sequences in this.The battle itself is phenomenal but even with its 45 minute runtime it still feels rushed somehow and I wanted to see more of the other characters like Dain who we see for no more then maybe a few minutes in battle. But otherwise this film was rushed Smaug's purge of Lake town was too short and far too rushed and maybe should've been concluded in the previous adaptation. Dol Guldur was clearly blitzed through which left a much anticipated confrontation a little sour in the end.A much awaited conclusion and much loved series come to an end. Yet a few characters were made up and some side lined for a much smaller role the Battle of Five Armies does not fail to capitalize on the battle sequences but otherwise doesn't offer up much in terms of enjoyment. But even with the flaws and all the changes made from the source material the Battle of Five Armies is still an adventure worth finishing and fighting for.Rating: A Comments: Best of the trilogy,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An Unexpected Disappointment,"So what did I think of The Hobbit Trilogy? Well, disappointing to say the least. Poor character development, uneven GCI quality, bloated runtime, zero emotional investment, etc. The Hobbit had it's fair share of problems, and I think I know why.First of all, nobody wanted to make these movies to begin with. As far back as the mid 90s Peter Jackson, director of what's now coined The Middle-Earth Saga was interested in making the LOTR films and expressed that making a movie for The Hobbit would be much more challenging due to the wealth of characters that had no development in the book and thus wouldn't translate to film very well. For those of you that don't know, The Hobbit was in development hell for years. Right after the final film in the LOTR trilogy came out in 2003, everyone was wondering if we would ever see a movie based on the prequel story, The Hobbit. The details are a bit fuzzy now but Guillermo del Toro was set to direct it in two parts but pulled out of the project just months before filming began for unknown reasons. To everyone's surprise though, Peter Jackson swooped in to save the project. Needless to say, fans of the LOTR films thought this was probably the greatest thing that could have happened, but I can't help but feel some of that past reluctance was still with Jackson. Maybe the studio had to pay him an incredible amount to come back. Just a theory mind you but consider this...After Jackson came in, the movies changed. Though we didn't know much at this point, we did know that it was gong to be two films based on The Hobbit. Then the planned pair of Hobbit films became a proper trilogy. Yeah, this is where things got messy. So the reasoning behind the extra film is that they wanted to tell the story of the white councils (consisting of Gandalf, Saruman, Galadriel, and Elrond) actions during Bilbo's adventure with the dwarfs. It would take an entire third film to do this as all of this took place on the other side of Middle-Earth (or a few hundred miles south at least) and was not in The Hobbit but explained later in a different Tolkien book. This eventually leads to Bilbo standing in the background for the majority of the third film but that's a relatively minor gripe. Where things simply didn't mesh in all of this is when we are introduced to a brand new original character as well as the return of Legolas from the LOTR trilogy for no reason other than to pad out these already bloated movies with a love triangle that goes absolutely nowhere. We also briefly see Ian Holm and Elijah Wood as Old Bilbo, and Frodo Baggins respectively. I imagine this was the studios idea to constantly remind us of the LOTR trilogy to create buzz in an attempt to replicate the first trilogy's success. It backfires by wasting too much time on these unnecessary glorified cameos. Speaking of time management...It's all made worse by a tight production schedule that had these movies being delivered under-cooked. I'm talking mainly about the special effects here. In LOTR the effects were pretty impressive for the time and CGI was used sparingly. All the Orcs were real people in makeup, sets were bigger with less green screen, and wide shots of miniatures were used to great effect in making all the locations look real, and grand in scale. In comparison, The Hobbit trilogy is bad with this stuff, like, Star Wars Prequel Trilogy bad when it comes not just to the abundance of CGI, but to the flux in quality. It just looks like crap at times. I mean, at least by Episode 3 the effects on Star Wars had been polished to the point of believably. It's the opposite here. While Gollum, and Smaug look great in the first two films respectively, there are points in the final Hobbit film that look about as photo-realistic to the live-action characters as an early Xbox 360 game. Not once was I fooled nor was I impressed by the third film visually.So what The Hobbit Trilogy basically is, are three bloated films with bad GCI living in the shadow of a trilogy of equally long, but well paced and expertly crafted films in every conceivable way.What's the worst is that I can see a pair of films worthy of the Peter Jackson pedigree here. Take out the forced love triangle, the Bowman's story and the White Counsel plot threads and you have two films worth every bit of recognition shoehorning Legolas and Frodo into these movies would have gotten them. Martin Freeman is a great Bilbo. Gandalf, and the dwarfs are more or less what you imagined from the book and the humor of the first film sits at just the right place to remind you that this story was based on a children's book, but takes place in an adults universe. The heart is there too. Themes of a people longing to return to their lost home, vengeance for fallen loved ones, and the lesson of what it means to put others before yourself in times of need are all present but never brought full circle. These films never stop to subtly point out the deeper meaning of things the way the Lord of the Rings films did, and it's disappointing.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Will You Follow Me...One Last Time?"" Of course, we will","4 books by J.R.R. Tolkien. 6 films. 2 trilogies. And they were made by one director. Plus, it took 17 years to create these films. Has there ever been a time in which Peter Jackson needed to take a break? After creating ""The Hobbit"" trilogy, maybe he can. In one of the quieter moments of ""The Hobbit: The Battle of The Five Armies"", Bilbo Baggins reminisces to Thorin Oakenshield about their journey that led them to the Dwarfs' Kingdom of Erebor, but also ""The good, the bad and how lucky I am that I made it home."" There is a lot to remember in the final Hobbit film, especially in the entire Middle-Earth saga. There are moments of light humor, thrilling action sequences that includes marvelous special effects as well as some awesome orc and goblin beheadings, powerful drama and of course, the enchantment that started with the imagination of an amazing author and an amazing filmmaker as well. In ""The Battle of The Five Armies"", the best of ""The Hobbit"" films, the stakes are high and our hobbit Bilbo along with our heroes are faced with deadly obstacles, not to mention that they discover something a whole lot more that could change Middle-Earth forever and will also lead into the events in ""The Lord of the Rings"". Now, of course, ""The Battle of The Five Armies"" immediately picks up right where ""The Desolation of Smaug"" left off. Bilbo (Martin Freeman), Thorin (Richard Armitage) and the Dwarfs has unintentionally let the dragon out of its cage. Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch) has left Erebor, and now terrorizes Lake-town. What happens to him and Lake-town is an astonishing sight to witness. Meanwhile, Gandalf (Ian McKellan) was captured by The Necromancer now revealing itself as Sauron and is now discovering that Sauron has built up an Army or two lead by Azog the Defiler (Manu Bennett) and his co-hort Bolg (John Tui) so they can cause and create hell on Middle-Earth. Bard the Bowman (Luke Evans), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) and the remaining dwarfs including Kili (Aidan Turner), Fili (Dean O'Gorman) and Bofur (James Nesbitt) has survived the attack on Lake-town. And the Elvenking Thranduil (Lee Pace) wants nothing more but to reclaim his own treasure. In the kingdom of Erebor, as predicted before, Thorin ""can't see beyond his own desire"", as he is suffering from Dragon-Sickness. Bilbo and the Dwarfs slowly starts to notice it, which leads to Bilbo to commit one fateful act to save Middle-Earth. If only that would be the case. Then, it leads to the subtitle of this film, in which Orcs, Men, Dwarfs, Elves and Eagles fight to the death in the ultimate battle of good vs. evil in the entire trilogy. Being the shortest of the entire Middle-Earth Saga (It's only 144 minutes), ""The Battle of the Five Armies"" has moments in which the characters realizing that something is worth fighting for rather than each other. They also commit (and sacrifice) themselves to find their place in this world. Because Jackson has a knack of creating the world of Middle-Earth with breathtaking special effects and a big cast, the films give each of the actors their moments to shine even if their moments are not as big as the others. For example, look at Martin Freeman. He caught my eye, surprisingly, as the lead in ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" and now, with the help of ""Sherlock"", the first season of FX's ""Fargo"" and with ""The Hobbit"" trilogy, he's becoming an top-notch, A-list star. His performance as Bilbo through these three films is remarkable, creating humanity as well as developing a surprisingly emotional side to him. I guess you can say he is becoming more like Bilbo, as well. Armitage's Shakespearian-like Thorin is scary-great. He creates a incredibly tragic character who slowly starts to care more about the journey, his kingdom, the Arkenstone and the gold, rather than the people guiding him on that quest, until he sees the dangers of falling into what his father and grandfather has done before, even when he says he doesn't want to be like them. Plus, it can be the last time we see some of the returning regulars like Ian McKellan as Gandalf the Grey, Cate Blanchett as Lady Galadriel, Christopher Lee as Saruman the Wise and Hugo Weaving as Lord Elrond as they strike back and make magic one last time. But, as I stated before, the supporting players like Luke Evans, Lee Pace, Orlando Bloom, Evangeline Lilly, Ken Stott (as Balin), Graham McTavish (as Dwalin) and Ryan Gage (as the slimy and greedy Alfrid) add a lot more sting and more emotional depth to their performances. ""The Battle of the Five Armies"" brings back some of the magic and greatness of ""The Lord of the Rings"" mainly because it adds a bit more substance to the films and it also moves in a more quicker pace. Plus, the action is more intense, the drama is more emotional, the love story between Kili and Tauriel is more stronger and there is some quirky humor snuck in there even when the tone has gotten more darker. These movies captivated me for so many years and it's rather fitting to say farewell to the cast and crew for bringing Tolkien's world of Middle-Earth to the screen with the last installment of the series. Like ""Harry Potter"", ""The Chronicles of Narnia"", and ""The Hunger Games"", their stories will (and have) become classics and once you viewed or read ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" as one equal, it all connects. Sometimes the best one is the last one worth waiting for.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
better than the book,"When i read the book, 10 years ago (or more, i don't remember) i didn't like it.I was comparing it to Lord of the Rings.Even the first movie i didn't like. Now i think that the Hobbit (trilogy)is really good,maybe not like Lord of the Rings but it has some important facts.First of all, there is Tauriel.The hobbit book has no women at all.Peter Jackson wanted his movies to be addressed to women as well as men.I really like Tauriel.She made the movie much more interesting.I also like Randagast as well as Saruman,Galadriel who also don't exist to the books.I didn't like dwarfs at first but now i like them .I think all actors/actresses did a great job(like in Lord of the Rings)but my favorite characters are Tauriel,Kili,Thranduil, Balin and of course Gandalf.I love elves so much!!!I was very sad when Kili died.I wanted him to be with Tauriel.Every time i see him dying i cry.I also like the performance of Richard Armitage(he was a great king) and the performance of Lee Pace!!(so handsome). Oh, i almost forgot Martin Freeman.His Bilbo was very funny!!Thank you all for this movie. Although Lord of the Rings is my favorite film, i think this movie deserves an 8/10 .Also it has more humour, while Lord of the Rings is more dark and sad.Dear Peter Jackson, can you please make more films concerning Middle Earth?",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"For fans of Lord of the Rings, or The Hobbit, This is a Must See!","The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is the final installment of The Hobbit trilogy. Bilbo and his company of Dwarfs have just unleashed the Dragon Smaug upon a small lakeside village and chaos breaks loose. Once word is out that the dragon has been driven from the mountain, armies from all over the land come to battle for the treasures that lie inside. It is a fight unlike any before and Bilbo must find a way to make peace before it is too late.I really enjoyed this film. From the very beginning it is full of action, epic battles and suspense. The graphics in this entire series are stunning. The Hobbit never fails to impress me with its immaculate visuals and special effects. The soundtrack to this film is beautiful, as expected, since the rest of the series is filled with wonderful music. I think that this film is the perfect closure to the series that so many have fallen in love with and been loyal fans of over the years.I'm also very impressed with the fact that this trilogy of films is adapted from one, relatively short novel and every film is so packed full of action and adventure, there is never a dull moment.The cast is marvelous as usual. Martin Freeman is the perfect actor to play Bilbo Baggins because he embodies his personality so well. It's been wonderful to watch Bilbo's character develop over the course of these films. He starts off very timid and unsure of himself, but by the end of the final film he has so much new found confidence from all he's been through and is a completely different hobbit than he was at the beginning of the journey.I'm very sad that the series has come to an end and that the journey is over, but I'm glad for the closure and amazed at how well this film turned out. Lord of the Rings fans will clearly love this film, but I think anyone who enjoys action, adventure and fantasy will love this film as well. There is a considerable amount of violence since the majority of the movie is an epic battle, so I suggest this film be viewed by ages 13 to 18-year-olds. If you have seen any of the previous films from The Hobbit or Lord of the Rings series, then this film should be suitable for you.I give The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies 5 out of 5 stars.

A good conclusion!,"I don't understand why this Hobbit movie is rated the lowest. Like the 3rd installment of the original Lord of the Rings trilogy, I liked this one the best! The action, visuals, CGI, battles, creative ice scenes, they were all very noteworthy! Sure there are some moments that defied physics and were far fetched but it was still quite the fun! I paid attention to this one more than the last one and the character deaths were well-deserved and emotional. There was also a cool scene where all of the most powerful characters faced off against ghost demons which was well-executed.

The Unfinished Edition,"It's funny, because each year that there's a Peter Jackson Middle Earth film released, I find myself less excited by the new December theatrical release, and more excited by the November Extended Edition release. That has never more been the case with these new Hobbit films. The second film, The Desolation of Smaug, while enjoyable in theaters, felt like tiresome action schlock that cut out some of the best parts of the book in favor of exhausting nonstop action. The extended edition bluray released last November rectified and fixed pretty much every major issue I had with the theatrical version of the film.So, when the less than stellar reviews for The third and final installment of The Hobbit came out, a part of me wondered if it was even worth seeing it in theaters at all. Should I just wait for the extended edition next November? Well, curiosity got the better of me and I went out and saw it and ... yeah you're probably better off waiting for the extended edition. Let's just call this the Unfinished Edition.It's no secret that there was a lot difficulty getting these Hobbit films made. First there was all the difficulty getting the rights to the film, then there was the New Zealand actors strike, then Del Toro's departure during pre-production leaving Peter Jackson holding the boat, and lastly, there was the last minute decision to turn this from a duology into a trilogy. Keep in mind also Peter Jackson had 3 years of pre-production time on the original Lord of the Rings Trilogy. On The Hobbit, he had less than one year. When you watch all the behind the scenes footage on the appendices of the Extended Editions, you can see that they really are working themselves to the nub right up until the very last minute to get everything done in time for release.As a result, The Hobbit movies just don't measure up in comparison to the Lord of the Rings movies. They look and feel rushed. They rely a lot more on CGI, and just don't have that polished finish. I think the decision to go 3D was a mistake too, because it forced Peter Jackson to abandon a lot of his practical effects techniques to get his forced perspective shots since he had to use two cameras in all scenes. This resulted in green screens in nearly every scene.The Battle of Five Armies, in particular, feels the most like a CGI cartoon or video game cutscene. Billy Connolly's character, Dain Ironfoot, looks entirely CGI in some scenes. Maybe he wasn't available for reshoots or something. Again, more evidence that the film was rushed.But the biggest problem with the film was in what was left out. They focused on the battle, which is actually just one chapter in the book, but left out pretty much all of the aftermath of the battle, which is actually a pretty large chunk of the book. I was surprised by this because I thought that if they were going to devote a whole movie on the last quarter of the book, you'd think they devote more time to more than just a couple of chapters. I suppose Peter Jackson didn't want people complaining about ""too many endings"" like they did in Return of the King. But without those resolutions, the movie really feels incomplete, and truly does feel unfinished. There are too many loose ends.All that negativity aside, I actually do think this is a really good movie and I did enjoy it quite a bit. There were a lot of great moments. When Peter Jackson stayed true to the source material, he nailed it. There were some great duels in the battle itself, some of the action sequences were stunning, although I could have done with a few less Alfrid hijinks and a bit more Master of Laketown's hijinks (he was a better character and his character's hijinks actually WERE in the book, whereas Alfrid was made up for the film).I also am happy he adapted parts of the appendices of Lord of the Rings for these movies. The Dol Goldur scenes were a welcome addition and I was really happy to see them. It was great seeing Saruman (Christopher Lee) in action with the White Council.Overall, yeah, I enjoyed it, but there were a lot of things that bugged me. I'm holding out hope that the Extended Edition will fix a lot of the problems I had with it. Since they have 11 months to tinker with the film before it comes out, maybe they'll have time to properly finish it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Can't compete with the ""Lord of the Rings"" But adequate for a Tolkien fan","Yes, they did laugh at me when I was the only one who clapped at the end of the movie. They would look at me as if I were crazy when I could perfectly lip sync at some instances specially the scenes from the previous movies. The staff would stare at me with scorn in their eyes. In their opinion, a homeless drunkard with nowhere better to go on a Saturday night who would even be glued to his seat five minutes after the credits, the last to leave the theatre. Oh well, What would they know of a sixteen year old who would hide his 50th anniversary edition of the Lord of The rings under his history text book, trying to trace Frodo's journey from Bag end through East Farthing on the map that was on the last page, while he was supposed to learn to mark the Panama canal on a world map. I can still mark the maps of the western lands of Middle Earth, Shire and Gondor better than any ""real"" map. I have read the book so many times that I could afford to make a bet with my mother on a page number and I would precisely turn to that particular page within 3 tries. Maybe I must tell my mother to send me my book or to bring it when she comes to see me. Knowing her, she might say its way cheaper to buy a new one. TBH ""The Hobbit"" wasn't great, they stretched it too much. They tried to make too much money out of a movie which portrayed greed as the ultimate cause of destruction. Maybe my standards are too high. Maybe I never liked The Hobbit. Maybe I know nothing about movies. The Hobbit series never gave me the raw emotions that the lord of the rings movies gave, specially The Battle of Five Armies. But nevertheless, thirteen years, that's how long it has been from 2001 to 2014. Peter Jackson might still make one more movie on Tolkien's work. It's been often said that thirteen is not a lucky number.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not worth watching,"The movie really aggravated me. Enough to make me write my first review on IMDb.For a frame of reference, let me start by saying that I did enjoy LOTR.Have you not yet seen The Hobbit 3, just don't !!!!! I simply cannot find a redeeming feature of the film. It's just an unnecessary abundance of establishing shots, excessive CGI and long slow motion close-ups. The close-ups makes everyone understand that the character is thoughtful, very hero-like or the situation is very dangerous. While the accompanying music is good and effective, it is somehow overused, which makes everything even more sickeningly nauseating.Technically it is not possible write a spoilers for this movie as the plot is virtually non-existent. However, the film is peppered with really bad slapstick goofs, which made me cringe so bad.The characters are not very likable, which makes the whole outcome unimportant. You feel indifferent about the 7 dwarfs. Bilbo has pretty much been written out of the movie, even though the movie is about him. Legolas is annoying and portrayed as a supernatural matrix-ninja-elf, and it is hard to sit through the movie without wishing him dead. Gandalf is actually likable but the time spent on slow motion closing close-ups is way too much.I get that the film is not an attempt on documentary, but the special effects in the film are made completely without anything resembling laws of physics. With the Hobbit Peter Jackson suffers from the same disease as George Lucas and Michael Bay, he does not know when to stop with the CGI.I have seen many bad movies both on television and in the movies, but it's rare that I want to leave the theater. It is also rare that I leave the cinema with a feeling of having wasted my time. Wasting my time is exactly what I did, and even 144 minutes of it. Time that I will never ever get back.If you are thinking : ""I may just catch it on DVD or TV"", just don't.I give it two stars because even though the shots are overwhelmingly cluttered with CGI, some are still quite impressive. Peter Jackson could easily have gotten extra stars had he just included more beautiful shots of landscape without any CGI. He did that well in LOTR.I can keep on ranting but let this be my last comment: This movie sucks!",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Will you have Peace, or War?""","I rated the 1st and 2nd Hobbit movies a 9/10. They had slow parts and all, but they were visually stunning, fantastically directed and entertaining. Now, that I finally managed to go to my local cinema and watch The Battle of The Five Armies (in 3D ofc) all I can say: I can't imagine a better send-off to a really, really good trilogy. It has everything like the first two movies, but the most important thing is: it never takes it's time. The ending chapter is fast, and in some scenes, when you would think what the hell you just saw, the battle (And believe me, it's easily as good as the battles LotR had) takes another turn, with another -sadly- predictable twist that who or what will save Who.I won't even talk about the visuals and the musical scores, it's (like always in the Middle Earth saga) a 10 out of 10, and that's what's so catchy about this final adventure, besides the character development. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fun to watch, just not too provocative","It's here; it's finally here. As the end of a trilogy, The Battle of the Five Armies doesn't have the emotional impact that The Return of the King, but it's still fine movie-making. The titular battle is a sweeping epic worthy of turned-up speakers and rattling high definition. It's an entertaining film; it just doesn't carry with it that sheen of instant classic, as its predecessors did.The movie picks up where the previous installment, The Desolation of Smaug, left off. Right away, we're helicoptered into dazzling action, as Smaug is attacking the floating village of Lake-town, burning homes and people alike with only revenge upon his intelligent but lizard-like brain. But it's when the monster is slain - not a giveaway, as it occurs so early in the movie - that things really get going. That's because although the Dwarfs, led by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) lay claim to the vast treasure, previously guarded by Smaug, beneath the Erebor, the Lonely Mountain, others want to get their beaks wet as well.The refugees of Lake-Town, led by Bard (Luke Evans), had been promised some of the treasure in exchange for harboring the Dwarfs - and now they need it, what with no homes and few possessions and all. Meanwhile, the Elves, led by Thranduil (Lee Pace) wish to reclaim a particular artifact for themselves, as it was reportedly stolen by Dwarfs eons ago in a different battle. Oh, but that's not all. It seems that a new race of Orcs, led by Azog the Defiler, is intent on taking the mountain as a strategic stronghold. And these are no ordinary, mindless Orcs, either. These guys have skills, more than just brute force.Thorin and his crew are in the mountain, looking for the Arkstone (a stone meant for the Dwarven King that makes him even more powerful), when Lake-Town falls. But there be madness in the mountain, madness that everyone in the party can feel is seeping into the skull of Thorin himself. As you might imagine, this makes our hero Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) a little uneasy.And what to make of these new Orcs? It's a situation that both puzzles and worries Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen), Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), Elrond (Hugo Weaving), and Saruman (Christopher Lee) - yep, all four appear in this movie. And, what's more, what they discover has direct ramifications for the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy to follow. Another connected subplot is the burgeoning romance between Dwarf Kili (Aidan Turner) and Elf Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly), with protective Legolas the Elf (Orlando Bloom) looking on concernedly, although it was not part of Tolkien's original work.So why isn't this a stunning spectacle on par of the LOTR movies? Because of a lack of emotional punch. The Lord of the Rings books were long and detailed, and director Peter Jackson slipped as much detail into the movies as possible. Much of the journey that the Fellowship undertook was seen on screen, allowing the viewer to get to know the characters and really empathize with them. There were also dynamics within the group (Gimli/Legolas, Frodo/Sam, Boromir/Aragorn) that are missing here. Really, many of the Dwarfs are interchangeable - as their similar-sounding names indicate - and the only real dynamics are between Thorin and Bilbo and between Thorin and Everyone Else. A lack of empathy for the Dwarfs' plight makes them less protagonists and more just regular participants in the sweeping plot.To be sure, the battle is a terrific scene. Dwarfs, Elves, Men, Orcs, perhaps something else that may not have been in the original book - they all come together in close hand-to-hand combat. For some, it's a fight to reclaim treasure; for others, it's a fight to gain the upper hand in a larger, upcoming war. And for still others, the fate of the whole of Middle-earth rests in who takes the mountain. Knowing the ultimate resolution to the battle doesn't diminish one's appreciation of it, either.And when the movie does end, the final scene is a fitting coda. It doesn't pack the punch of the end of Return of the King, and couldn't - because readers know already of the events following The Hobbit and leading up to The Fellowship of the Ring. Jackson does a fine job with the tale, even if The Hobbit was just one short book and even if he had to invent characters (Tauriel). He did the best with what he had, and he was the right choice to direct the trilogy all along. Even his doppleganger, Guillermo del Toro, wouldn't have given us as much of a thrill ride.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Toyworld,"By now it's clear what they needed to do here, to wholly reinvent the story as prelude to the apocalypse of LOTR. Then we could have momentum, imports, deep orchestration, destiny as foreknowledge of inevitables. The book was not originally so, it was modestly conceived as a standalone with the mythology expanded and embellished in later years up until Tolkien's death and beyond. Instead we have tacky interjections of LOTR and the thin book blown up into a funpark ride. A failure.But this lets me talk about something else. Why LOTR worked so well is because we had an immersive story, or marvelous stretches of it, seen through kids' eyes (hobbits) as they encountered ancient beings of unfathomable power, and we had a map of the larger world that we flitted back and forth to keep up with the journey, an inner view we explored and one from above that we had at our fingertips. We were swept.Of the three films this is the one that perhaps comes closest to having some resemblance, with distinct armies coming from all four directions and converging on the same valley for the epic stand. Nearly the whole film takes place there. There is a sense of larger machinery beyond these horizons, one of which is Mordor. But there's also no sense of real adventure in a world we explore, at one point we travel up north merely to see an army advancing from there.There's not much else to say; the whole is a giant toyworld. The best these can be is a pile of material for someone to edit into a single film that serves as introduction to LOTR marathons, I hear this has already happened online.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The Battle of the Five Armies: A fitting and satisfying end to an epic cinematic journey""","""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" is a masterful conclusion to Peter Jackson's adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's beloved novel. The film expertly blends stunning visual effects, heart-pumping action, and a strong emotional core to create an epic and satisfying finale. The battle scenes are nothing short of spectacular, showcasing the incredible world-building and attention to detail that has become a hallmark of Jackson's Middle-earth films. The performances of the talented cast, particularly Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins and Ian McKellen as Gandalf, are outstanding and bring depth and nuance to the characters. Overall, ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" is a fitting end to a cinematic journey that will be remembered for years to come.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
how not to make movies,"First, I would like to say that I love all the books from Tolkien, Lord of the Rings movies and I think that the first two Hobbit movies were not that bad.The third one, however, was horrible, full of pointless violence, cheap CGI with no real story = typical Hollywood action movie with no meaning. They should have ended with 2 movies instead. More so that the original book is not big enough for 3 movies. I guess they made 3 movies just for money :(I'm only glad that it was the final part and I don't have to watch another one. Peter Jackson, shame on you for turning my favorite books author into this crap movie :(",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hobbit:The battle of the five armies.,"For sheer story telling and action, this is the movie one should watch. As well as the heroism depicted. Though it is set in history, in an era gone by, it is a visual delight. The beautiful sets are a wonderful sight.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
