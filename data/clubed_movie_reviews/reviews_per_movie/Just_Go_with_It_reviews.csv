One of the better ones,"Sandler is very hit and miss with his films, this however is one of the hits.The wife and I were laughing constantly and even use some of the jokes between each other today. Highly recommended as the film is full of gags and quips that'll keep you laughing for 90 minutes.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
not expecting this: job well done,"I've seen almost all of Jennifer Aniston's movies and most of them I really did not like. So my expectations of ""Just go with it"" were very low. But I was pleasantly surprised to find that I was laughing with tears in my eyes the first 20min of watching this movie and I didn't stop laughing till the screen showed black.Al though the movie almost is 2 hours long, I wasn't bored at any time. The story was well written, the acting was amazing and hilarious and it was original in it's jokes. It did have a typical ending, but for once it didn't bother me because of the good build up in the story and the development of the characters.If you do have a weakness for typical comedy movies, but can't seem to find a good one these days, definitely check out this one: laughter guaranteed!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Silly cozy comedy to enjoy,"Huge fan of Adam Sandler except a few that are ""poop"" so I'm surprised I didn't see this one cause it's pretty good! Nothing special though ""Punch-Drunk Love"" is among my favorites!Mostly stupid slapstick comedy as usual with Sandler's flicks, which isn't bad. Good entertainment for a couple hours not much to judge.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Likable Sandler-fare, as usual","Adam Sandler is getting pretty solid at producing and acting in quasi-poignant tales that get him somewhat further away - and, ultimately, closer to (doesn't make sense, I know) - from his proto-Sandler-style of filmmaking that has his vaguely proto-typical cast of characters - hapless, hopeless geeks, improbable ladies' man, a ""nice guy"" that all the ladies want, but still seem to settle on the douches. Sandler brings his ""crew"" together - former/current SNLers, Allen Covert (who is pretty much in every Sandler movie that I can think of), and some heavy-hitters occasionally. ""The Wedding Singer,"" ""Grown-Ups,"" and, now, ""Just Go With It"" all pander to this amiable style of film-making that is at times borderline gross-out - but just pulls away before you realize this probably isn't an Apatow-slacker movie, nor is attempting to be.Sandler is a plastic surgeon who long ago accidentally discovered he could play the ""my wife is a terrible person who abuses me"" card to score with hot chicks at the bar. Fact is he's not actually married - he and/or his wife left him at the altar many years before when he discovered she really didn't like him - but he's become so comfortable with lying to score with the chicks he just doesn't care - or seem to. Jennifer Aniston is his office assistant, a sweet, single gal with 2 kids. She doesn't much care for how he deals with the ladies, but she still likes him because she sees what a sweet guy he really is under the surface of his rather devious womanizing that all starts with a lie.Sandler meets the bounteous and beautiful - and, very young - Brooklyn Decker at a party. They sleep together on the beach and in the morning Decker discovers he's ""married."" Sandler immediately throws a lie out there - he IS in fact, married (wait, no he's not, but it's all a lie anyway) but he's in the process of getting a divorce because his relationship with his wife - again, playing the same card - is very bad. Decker somehow believes him and off we go with the rest of the movie where Aniston agrees to be his fake wife and ultimately go off on a vacation with Decker, Sandler, Aniston's kids, and Nick Swanson as the court jester/boob (basically a version of Rob Schneider from Sandler's other ""Happy Madison"" movies) who pretends to be Aniston's boyfriend.There are a lot of funny setups and jokes - enough to enjoy the movie, for sure, even if they do clearly seem to be Sandler-ish in their obviousness. Hey, he's a plastic surgeon, let's see where we might milk that. Decker is half his and Aniston's age - let's see where we might milk that. Swanson is an often over-the-top boob - let's see where we can grab some silly jokes there. Aniston's kids - the daughter, especially - are good for quite a few laughs as well.I half expected Decker to be pretty bad, but she does just fine. She is playing against top comedic talent here - though honestly Sandler nearly seems on auto-pilot in most of his movies - and nowhere is Jessica Simpson-like delivery in evidence. It hardly needs to be said she is being used for her looks more than her supposed talent, but her ability to transcend the ""Hey, I'm just here to be a C-cup blond bimbo in a bikini"" obviousness of her role is commendable. Sandler is notorious - or very successful, depending on your perspective - in bringing in at least one or two pieces of eye candy to most of his films, but in a manner that is less blatant or purely perverse. Yes, Sandler likes hiring hot chicks, but he also likes the good/nice guy to have a shot with her, which makes most of us nerds feel at least a little bit more hopeful. Decker and Aniston both of course fill this role, quite well.While clearly not an intentional Oscar-winner, Sandler proves he is again capable of making a funny, somewhat poignant, generally enjoyable PG-13-bordering-on-R-rated film.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Adam Sandler Formula Works Again,"Just saw at this an advanced screening in Huntington Beach.It was pretty damn good. I do have to admit that I am an Adam Sandler fan. Being 21, I grew up seeing his films in theaters and for the most part liked them all. I think with Big Daddy, Dennis Dugan and Adam Sandler's Happy Madison crew really started a formula of movie. Central conflicted and imperfect character Adam (who has a good heart of course), falls in love with the girl of his dreams, who is younger and way better looking than him, all formulated around a specific central premise (i.e. with this film it's Adam's lies piling on top of lies) supported by extremely strong, quirky side character performances. This might be the epitome of this established formula, really passing 50 First Dates in my opinion. The typical Sandler ridiculous humor and smart-ass remarks are extremely well balanced with perfectly timed and executed emotional moments. The set-up for the story is pretty basic and at first almost appears predictable. It is to some extent, but the crazy directions the movie takes based on Sandler's lies is well done and only stretches a few times. But what do you expect from the Happy Madison crew?The 2 kids in the film did a good job and had some funny lines. I am not a Jennifer Aniston fan at all but really actually liked her in this. I sort of understand her popularity and charm after this movie. She seemed more genuine and I felt an emotional attachment to her that I have always lacked with her. Plus, she is showcased in a particular waterfall scene and looks absolutely fantastic in a bikini. Brooklyn Decker is unbelievably gorgeous, as we all know from the SI Swimsuit Edition, but I was very surprised at how natural of an actress she was. She seemed very comfortable and didn't overact much. She is extremely cute and lovable. Nicole Kidman and Dave Mathews were great as an uber cool couple. Nicole was a bit over the top as she has been of late (like since Moulin Rouge), but thats what her character called for so I understand. Dave was surprisingly good as an almost drugged up yuppie, cool boyfriend of Nicole's. Nick Swardson was absolutely hilarious and by far steals every scene he is in. He really comes into the movie about 1/3 of the way in and from there on out its his movie. Nick Swardson deserves fame for this.I can't say for sure how the critics will receive it. I can handle suspension of disbelief as long as it leads to a funny payoff. For the most part these moments are delivered. It's a great date movie and a great movie for Sandler fans. He has an unbelievable recent track record for success, but this will top all of them at the box office.",,Anonymous,Romance
Decent if unexceptional,"I am not a fan of Adam Sandler, though I have liked some of his performances and films, but when Jennifer Aniston has good material she is good. I was expecting Just Go with It to be crap, but while it was unexceptional on the whole I found it decent. Both Sandler and Anniston have done better, both have also done worse. Sandler is not amazing, but he is not as irritating as he can be. Anniston's role is one-dimensional, but she is beguiling and the chemistry they have is likable. Nicky Swardson, who I can't stand usually, is also good. The film looks appealing, is directed assuredly and the soundtrack is fitting and not too generic. The script however while having some funny and tender moments has a number of weak moments coming across as stilted and cloying. The story is rather thin and predictable especially the ending, and the characters while appealingly performed are generally under-developed and stereotyped. All in all, a decent and better than expected film but not great. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sandler is back...,"Finally, Adam Sandler is rising up from the perpetual spiral of semi-interesting movies he has been riding for the past years. Sure, the movie ""Just Go With It"" looks disturbingly similar to ""50 First Dates"" when you look on the cover, but they are two completely different movies altogether.The story told in ""Just Go With It"" is fairly sassy and Hollywoodish; a classical lovely story of sorts. Danny (played by Adam Sandler) falls in love with Palmer (played by Brooklyn Decker). They go away to Hawaii with Danny's assistant Katherine (played by Jennifer Aniston) and his friend Eddie (played by Nick Swardson). And the story rolls as the little white lies escalate and grow larger and larger. I am not going on with more of the story here, but being a 'straight off the Hollywood romantic comedy assembly line', then there is no surprise to how the movie ends. You know it straight from the minute the movie starts. But still, the movie is quite enjoyable. Although stereotypical, then the story is a good one, and you quickly get into it.There are some really good characters in the movie, aside from the four main characters. I especially liked the plastic surgery enhanced people at the party in the beginning of the movie. They were hilarious, and drew lots of laughs.The location of the movie, in Hawaii, really adds a romantic aspect to the movie, and it works out really, really well. You can almost feel the sand between your toes and feel the waves as they crash gently against your shins. Thumbs up on making the feel of the movie stand out this much.There is a really good chemistry between Aniston and Sandler, and they really brought the story to life and they were in their aces in this movie.I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, as I had expected it to be another of Sandler's mass-produced half-funny comedies. So if you like romantic comedies and are a fan of either (or both) Sandler or/and Aniston, then ""Just Go With It"" is definitely worth checking out. The movie has some wonderful moments, it will make you laugh and it will make your heart all warm and fuzzy.Thumbs up, and welcome back Sandler...",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Better than expected,"First of all, it is an Adam Sandler movie. If you hate Adam Sandler movies, then you won't like this.I gave it an 8/10 because it was one of the better Adam Sandler movies. The plot and storyline was better than I expected; the development was pretty good as well. There were definitely a lot of points where I had to slap my forehead b/c it was silly funny.Yeah, its highly unrealistic, but if you expected realism, whats wrong with you? Sure, Jennifer Anniston is the ""uglier chick,"" which is like saying a million dollars isn't that much money, but she did a good job in the movie.The only complaint I had was Adam Sandler used all the lines I planned on using with the girl I took to see it!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
One Of The Better Ones,"One of Sandler's better films from this period, finding the right balance between grounded and zany, as a plausible plot gets more ridiculous; the perfect platform for a display of Sandler's talents in frustration.After lying to his dream girl (Decker), the successful Sandler enlists his faithful assistant (Aniston) to pose as his supposedly vile, soon-to-be ex-wife. As the lie evolves, more of those close to him are recruited, attempting, and failing, to present him in the most favourable light. Increasingly wild antics ensue.Whilst the ending can be predicted from minute one, the journey along the way is still funny and enjoyable. Just Go With It displays a great chemistry between Sandler and Aniston, one which would be reprised in the later Murder Mystery films. It does, however, fall victim to it's attempts to make child actors funny through big personalities. In general, whilst an integral part to the plot, the uninhibited daughter is more of an irritant than funny character in scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Silly premise - bad acting and poor direction,"Seriously, this movie was ridiculous from the very beginning. Sandler and Aniston were bad caricatures of a plastic surgeon and his compassion less assistant, Brooklyn Decker came across as the world's stupidest school teacher and worst of all was Nick Swordson's rendition of Jerry Lewis' Mad Professor. The kids (although cute) weren't even likable and as their mother, JA showed all the warmth and maternal instincts of a Madame Tussaud figure. On the bright side for Aniston, her bikini body was way hotter than Deckers. The only bright spot was Nicole Kidman's conniving character. I can only assume that a lost wager on Kidman's part accounted for her appearance in this charade of a movie. If that's the case, she's probably sworn off betting forever. So sorry I added to the week's coffers. It's not even worth the price of a rental.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just Go With It,"I'm a bloke of 32. I took the other half to watch this last night as I do enjoy Comedy's. Not much of a cinema goer as tend to be the one saying 'ooh I knew I wanted to see that' when the film gets released and then completely forget to actually go.I was in absolute stitches watching this, it's by far the funniest film I've seen in a long-long time. Normally watching a comedy I'd chuckle and laugh a bit but I was actually laughing out loud almost the whole film - as were a most of the other viewers in the cinema.I do like (as my missus puts it) 'stupid comedy's' like; Anchor Man, Dodgeball and Hear no Evil See No Evil etc. so this is where I'm coming from.I think the whole cast was near on perfect with Adam Sandler providing hilarious moments throughout, with Jenifer Aniston sexier and funnier than I've ever known her to be. if you watch the film you'll know that Dolf Lungren was side splitting at times and The kids worked really well especially Keekee-D's Mary Poppins English Accent!.... Oh and not to fortget the beautiful blonde :)All in all an absolute hoot and would thoroughly recommend it to anyone.Would have given it a 10/10 but nothings perfect :) so its a 9/10 from me.ps.

"""Just Go with It: A Tropical RomCom Escape with Sandler and Aniston's Winning Chemistry","""Just Go with It,"" a 2011 romantic comedy directed by Dennis Dugan, offers a lighthearted and entertaining escape into the world of mistaken identities and unexpected love. Starring Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston, the film follows the story of a plastic surgeon, played by Sandler, who enlists his assistant, portrayed by Aniston, to pose as his ex-wife to cover up a lie. While the premise may seem formulaic, the movie stands out for its charismatic performances, humor, and the scenic backdrop of Hawaii.Why You Should Watch:The primary reason to watch ""Just Go with It"" is the undeniable chemistry between Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston. Their on-screen dynamic is effortless, and their banter provides a solid foundation for the film's comedic moments. Aniston's comedic timing complements Sandler's trademark humor, creating a delightful synergy that keeps the audience engaged.

Forget It,"This terrible remake of I.A.L. Diamond's work on Cactus Flower back in 1969, itself based on an excellent stage play, was difficult to sit through: Too long, too unfunny, and to formulaic. Relying on sight gags and stale jokes cannot save a bad film, much less a screenplay that probably required very little effort on the part of the writers. Of late, much of what's coming out of Hollywood reeks of paranoia. When one is afraid to take a risk, in the genre of romantic comedies, remake something that was successful years ago. This travesty is indicative such a mentality. Also, when will Jennifer A. wake up and stop getting herself involved in films that will do little for her career? Save your money and rent Cactus Flower. Trust me, you'll be happy you did.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hmmmm....Okay.....,"I put this on mainly for my girlfriend to watch and wasn't expecting very much. The opening scene explaining the wedding ring made me laugh more than a few times. The acting wasn't amazing and the story was okay but I found myself laughing at quite a lot of this movie. Jennifer Aniston was her usual character but I didn't dislike her and actually found myself thinking 'Hmm, I'd like to wake up next to her..' You can tell what is going to happen almost as soon as the movie starts but I found it quite watchable. Apart from Nicole Kidman. She annoyed me in this movie.Overall this isn't going to be in your top 100 movies of the year and it certainly isn't going to win any awards but it is a harmless movie that will make you laugh (Unless you have no sense of humour).I suggest buying it when its £3 in Asda then giving it to your sister/aunt/mum/daughter for Christmas after you've watched it. ;)",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
This Movie Really Cheered Me Up,"...from the horrendously depressing Comments. What on Earth is going on with humans? This is one of my, now, favorite Adam Sandler Movies.

But I never bashed them or anything crazy like that. I just didn't watch their stuff. But this made me like both of them.. And I think they do have chemistry. They were friends for over 20 years when this was made. I plan on watching more of their movies now. Finally some comedies to look forward to on my streaming services.I also liked that Nicole Kidman did something silly for a change. I loved her in Stepford Wives as well.

A Movie That Adam Sandler Wasn't a Total Clown,Adam Sandler movies are always ridiculous. This happens to be one where he actually acts and isn't just a movie full of dumb Adam Sandler jokes. Maybe Jennifer Aniston makes it better? Pretty decent movie... from Adam Sandler.,7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Better than Expected... Comparatively,"Danny (Adam Sandler) is a plastic surgeon who's found that a fake wedding ring is his greatest weapon in picking up girls. Despite its success, he has caught the attention of Palmer (Brooklyn Decker) without it, and when she sees it she doesn't react like the other women. Lying, Danny tells her he's going through a divorce and to cover that end of the fib he coerces his assistant Katherine (Jennifer Aniston) into playing the part of his wife. The snowball effect gets into full swing and before long Danny finds himself vacationing in Hawaii with Palmer as well as his fake family complete with two kids. His biggest trouble may be in deciding if the charade he's keeping is actually the one he wants.Just Go with It is a return to the typical Sandler vehicle, which it turns out is tragically dated and littered with blows to the crotch. The changup comes in Aniston being a more established foil than he's used to being paired, so some of her recent work shows through. You'd think that the combination of two over-exposed styles would clash, but they complement what the other is missing. Truth be told, having a sassy Aniston to knock Sandler down a peg works remarkably well. What isn't a good call is having to aim for the gross-out joke in the middle of some good dialog. So as you can image their job is going to put them in situations with body parts that aren't going to be shown in this PG-13 comedy. As likable as the Sandler-Aniston duo comes across, it's unfortunate that Just Go with It lives and dies by the supporting cast. On one hand Nicole Kidman and Dave Matthews hit a remarkable amount of laughs, and the former has a very large part in a film that doesn't show her for even a second in the promos. That's what I call a ""pleasant surprise"" and I wish other movies took note. The other end of the spectrum is visited with a combination of horrible child acting (possibly directing but more on this soon) and Nick Swardson. With the kids you get the sense that these children are suffering from the direction of Dennis Dugan who always makes the youth overly expressive. This time it troubles me more because the children have quite a bit of lines to grin through. With Maggie, a character supposedly taking up acting, she's never genuine. Michael similarly draws inspiration from performances for his role as Danny's son but instead is like a possessed cadaver. Finally Swardson is clearly aiming to be the most obnoxious actor ever. Not to get into too much detail over it, but there's nothing funny about it.The outcome of the narrative is astoundingly conventional. This isn't a story that's going to challenge even a Facebook drone. Maybe I'm over analyzing, but the distasteful level of some of the scenes is so strong that I wonder if the intention is to test the tolerance of audience. Once you've sat through enough of it, you really do just go with it.To say that Just Go with it was better than I expected is merely a comparative phrase. Did I expect it to suck? Yes. Indeed there is a great deal about it that puzzles me as to how Sony Pictures could have decided to release this to the public, but in some ways the cacophony of gags is effective because one is bound to hit you hard. I had belly laughs and that's not easy to coax from me.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Just go with it,"If you are looking for a highly intellectual movie, forget it. This is a simple movie with a simple story line and simple jokes. However, if you like to go to the movies just to break the routine, to have some laughs, and to change your mind, this is an excellent movie. Most highly critical people looking for perfection will give this movie a bad review, no doubt. People who gave an 8 to True Grit will not appreciate this movie...Acting is excellent. Jennifer Aniston is perfect in that role; this is her best performance in a movie so far, except maybe for Marley and Me. Adam Sandler is much more natural than usual. He does not have to deliver all of the stupid jokes, and has a to act his role during most of the movie. I would say this is an equivalent performance as in 50 First Dates, or even better. He is very funny (as usual), but also compassionate and lovable. Nick Swardson is the clown of the movie, which allows Sandler to act more and leave some of the funny stuff to others. Swardson made me and my whole family laugh out loud during many parts of the movie. In fact, it had been a long time since I heard my two teenagers laugh so much and so loudly during a movie.The two kids are really good supporting actors. They bring a lot to the movie. They make the situation more complicated a few times in unexpected ways. Bailee Madison is very impressive. We will see her again and often.The normal cast of Happy Madisson movies are all there for their usual 2 minutes and all bring their own laugh. One of them made me swallow water in my lungs! He is good! I will let you guess which one.All and all, we left very satisfied and happy we had this family night, even the teenagers.

Harmless fun from beginning to end.,"Adam Sandler's/Dennis Dugan's films has been using the same formula since ""Happy Gilmore"" (Heck even if you watch ""Problem child"" you can clearly see Dennis Dugan made it) Same type of humor, a lot of the same actors..You would think that by now everyone would now beforehand what to expect from their films.That is why I am always surprise that you get people moaning about Sandler's/Dungan's films..Why are they going to them , they should know the type of films it's gonna be because their films are always the same type?!! I personally like watching those films, they are brainless , harmless fun and most importantly they are the type of comedy you can bring kids along(It's getting very rare,most comedy does allusion about sex and drugs these days).I am never surprise by those films, I go expecting something that I always end up getting,I knew exactly what sort of film ""Just go with it"" was from who made it and I was not disappointed the least. It was a sweet little comedy. Jennifer Aniston actually had good chemistry with Sandler and I was surprised by how great they work together as they are two actors I would have not imagine together as ""lover"". Nicole Kidman was wonderful as the bitchy school friend of Aniston's character and I might add that she was the best looking I have seen her on film in a long time. The two kids were very natural and likable , I was afraid at first when I knew the kids were going to be featured in the film heavily but those two were great actors for their young age. Beside all of this like I mentioned before this is a Happy Gilmore film and people should be aware of what comes with it.It's light hearted fluff and I personally liked it. So to all the haters if you watched Grown ups last year and didn't like it, why did you go into that one? If you didn't like ""Just go with it"" I think you should stay away from any upcoming films by Sandler and Dugan because chances are you'll be back on those board complaining about them as well..",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Unfunny Abysmal Movie!,I had the misfortune of sitting through this movie with an elderly patient and his wife. NO ONE laughed much in the entire theater.The jokes were obviously written either by a 12 year old boy or someone with brain damage.Why does Jennifer Aniston keep playing the SAME character over and over? Adam Sandler is supposed to be a plastic surgeon and Aniston his assistant. Their unprofessional behavior would have me running from this office. Jokes were stupid and crude. Sandler fakes being married to pick up women because he was hurt years ago at his wedding.

I like this one...,"JUST GO WITH ITI have seen this before and I do like it. It is not Adam's best film, but it is still funny and entertaining.The movie is about a plastic surgeon who pretends to be married just to get girls. All goes well until he falls for a girl that he meets at a party, but then she finds the wedding ring in his pocket. He then tries to convince her that he is getting divorced, but when she wants to meet his soon to be ex wife he panics. So he persuades his receptionist to pretend to be his wife and then the comedy begins.It is a typical romantic comedy there is comedy right up until the end of the movie where it is all romance. The comedy is very good, but it has the typical Adam Sander feel to it, which is not a bad thing. Adam as always gives 100%. He is a great comedy actor, but unfortunately his recent movies are just nowhere near as good as his earlier ones. Grown Ups and Jack and Jill was average at best. In fact I was very disappointed with Jack and Jill, I just thought that was terrible.This movie also stars Jennifer Aniston. Jennifer is a typical romantic comedy actress. I am still waiting to see her actually challenge herself and take on a serious role. I think she might be OK with it, but until she gets out of the comedy rut, she will never be an Oscar winner. But putting that behind, I don't actually mind her. She is good at comedies, and she can be very funny at times. She does a good job in this, but it is not her best performance. Another great character was Eddie played by Nick Swardson. He was pretending most of the way through the film to be from Sweden (I think), but his fake accent and his character was hilarious. Especially when he tries to give CPR to a sheep. I was laughing so much. You have to see it.It was very good to see Nicole Kidman in this too. She has a very small role but she plays the character very well.The children in this movie were not too annoying either. I find children actors very irritating most of the time, but they were not too in your face. The girl, played by Bailee Madison, was slightly annoying, but that was because she was putting on a fake English accent throughout the whole movie. It started out funny, but after a while it lost its comedy value and I stopped laughing, I just wished she would stop talking. Too much of a good thing is never good. But generally not bad little actors. The boy was played by Griffin Gluck. He was quite good too. I believed he was a sad little kid who had Daddy issues.The story is not bad, the acting is not great but works very well with the comedy & the romance is not too over the top which is always good. I always find that with romantic comedies the romance kills the mood sometimes of the comedy because it is drawn out too long, but this movie is not too bad for that. There is a lot of fun to be had with a plastic surgeon in a comedy, and Adam knows how to make it funny. He goes to extremes to be funny with his ideas. He also seems a likable person which always helps to find him funny.I will give this film 7 out of 10.""Mommy!

"A good formula of comedy and romance, enjoyable with decent amount of salt and pepper that will leave you smile at the end of the show","I might be a bit biased about this because I have a personal sympathy for Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler but I found this movie entertaining, simple and relaxing. These are all characteristics that most romcoms these days lack in. They all try too much to be either funny, either too romantic, either too complex and suffer from the storytelling point of view but this film, while it's a typical romcom it still delivers more than expected. But let's go into slicing this bread entirely and as objectively as I can.Danny (Adam Sandler) is a successful plastic surgeon which after a disappointing start within his first marriage, he starts using his ex-wedding ring to get regular chicks in his bed. His methods work till he meets this gorgeous young blond named Palmer (Brooklyn Decker). In order to convince her he has real interest in their future he needs to play the ex-husband/present-dad card by asking his personal assistant Katherine (Jennifer Aniston) to pretend to be his ex-wife. Things go really crazy and messed up when kids are involved and the ""little"" trip to Hawaii is the cherry on top of the cake. It turns out clicheic and Danny falls for Katherine but I never lost my patience. I really enjoyed the delivery. The dialogue wasn't bad, the acting was pretty much what this movie needed, a pleasant appearance from the lovely Nicole Kidman, it has funny moments and not funny in a retarded way, no nonsense and no stupid development of both characters and story and last but not least, it has a solid ""feel-good"" atmosphere. This film is getting too much heat in my opinion and so many feel they need to bash this because ""oh, another clicheic romcom""... Well, I was entertained and I think this was the purpose of the makers. Great time at the cinema and definitely not a waste of money or time.The production design, the technical execution was more than OK. It kind of reminded me of Forgetting Sarah Marshall as far as captions, contrast and chosen music. This is one of the best movies made by Aniston in the last years, probably since ""Marley & Me"" which a really good weekend movie. Adam Sandler is back in doing more of his good stuff and God, could I ask one thing? How does these women look so damn well at their age?...Overall, the film's title pretty much suggest what the audience should do with the movie: ""Just Go with It"". It's a good formula of comedy and romance, enjoyable with decent amount of salt and pepper that will leave you smile at the end of the show.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Charming Sandler comedy,I don't know if it was because I watched this movie I. A hotel room in the middle of the night... but it was actually a cute and charming Adam Sandler movie.

"Not perfect, but a lot of fun!","When I decided to give this movie a shot, I had very low expectations. With all the sucky crap that's out there, you are continuously finding yourself giving up on movies only ten minutes into them. The only thing I wanted was to see a few fresh jokes and I sure got them with this one. In fact, I got plenty of them. I got good performances from most of the cast. Adam Sandler was especially good and even though I've never liked Jennifer Aniston, she did a fine job here. However the guy who stole the show for me was Nick Swardson. What an idiotic role that guy had, but he certainly delivered and had me laughing like a sick maniac. I must say the kids were also very good. Anyone's who's looking for something that's Oscar worthy should stay away from it. This is far from being perfect, but it was never meant to be. It's meant to be silly and fun and that's exactly what this movie is.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Hilarious, romantic, fun, and a feel good. Makes me so happy every time I see it! A little kick from Adam Sandlers classic comedies, with Jen's romantic and timeless character makes for a perfect pick me up movie. A MUST WATCH!!!!!! This movie has created many inside jokes for my family and quite the popular lingo with my peers (live at the index cards, browch, or DIE).

"A really, really funny movie. One of Sandler's best movie in recent years. Very much like Big Daddy, but funnier. I say B+","""My tolerance level is here, if it goes up to here I'm selling you out and leaving."" Danny (Sandler) has a unique way to meet women, he uses a wedding ring. After a gorgeous woman named Palmer finds out his trick she threatens to leave unless Danny introduces her to his evil soon-to-be ex-wife. After getting Katherine (Aniston) to go along with it they all end up in Hawaii where things get complicated. After movies like ""Bedtime Stories"" and ""Click"" it seemed like Sandler was starting to move away from what makes him funny. ""Grown-ups"" was good, but that seemed more like friends having fun then a movie. This movie is closer to the humor in ""Big Daddy"" then any other movie he has done recently. While still a pretty soft PG13 Sandler, this movie is actually very, very funny. Nowhere near the days of ""Happy Gilmore"" or ""Billy Madison"", Sandler is slowly trying to capture his younger days, and with this and ""Grown-ups"" he is getting close. The chemistry between Sandler and Aniston is perfect and I would not be surprised to see them in more movies together. Very, very entertaining and funny. A good laid back comedy that holds the funny all the way through, unlike movies like ""The Dilemma"" which is funny, but turns serious at the end. Overall a very funny movie that will not disappoint. I give it a B+.Would I watch again? - Yes, I sure would.*Also try - Grown-ups & Big Daddy",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Full of Devlin comedy,"Just Go With It is at times dreadfully boring and extremely unfunny as it approaches the two hour mark and we are still waiting to laugh. It is one of the most selfish, laugh-free comedies I've ever seen barely saved by the beautiful scenery and likable Aniston. But even with those two minor improvements that we see what Just Go With It is really about - cheap laughs and cliché Sandler schtick.This was based on a Broadway play that later became a 1969, Walter Mathau film called Cactus Flower, that later became a French play, that finally became this. I say this story has its tank run dry as this story is not only not funny but kind of sad. Sandler plays Danny, who called off his wedding day when he heard his wife talking behind his back with her friends.Going to a bar with his ring on, he attracts a women and tells her a sympathy story leading to them sleeping together. Twenty five years later, he still wears the wedding ring and continues to sleep with loser bimbos to sort of never run the risk of falling in love. This works, until he meets Palmer (Decker), a beautiful women who finds the ring in his jean pocket.Danny panics and tells lie after lie that he is married, but getting a divorce to his office worker Katherine (Aniston). Lie after lie leads him to fake-fathering Katherine's two bratty kids who he plans to fake kill off later. The ""family,"" Palmer, and Danny's friend all plan to go to Hawaii where more nonsense takes place.Some scenes, notably the hula contest and the scenes at the kid's playground, go on for way too long and it's nothing but a poorly written joke made to be completely not funny. I guess we're supposed to root for Danny in hopes he'd get the girl, but I find no likable qualities about a womanizing loser who is not the least bit clever or funny. This is yet another movie that could be over if Danny had told Palmer he does sleeps with several women saying he is married and has a bad wife. He could then go on to tell her how she's different in a real passionate way and take her out to a bar and they can get to know each other. That might've made a way better film.Nicole Kidman shows up in quite possibly the worst role she's ever been offered as Devlin, Katherine's old rival. What a coincidence she is staying at the same hotel in Hawaii as Katherine at the most convenient time when she is all tied up with her ""family"" issues.Also in the movie is Nick Swardson who is definitely the worst person in this movie playing a close friend of Danny's sporting one of the worst German accents I've ever heard. Every scene is he is in is too long and not at all funny in any way. Not even good for a bad laugh.It comes as no surprise Just Go With It is directed by Dennis Dugan who worked on other bad comedies like The Benchwarmers, Big Daddy, and Grown Ups. It seems ever since I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry, a decent comedy, Dugan has had nothing but fun placing Sandler in every character possible. Now he is working on Jack & Jill, another comedy that pairs Sandler and Al Pacino together. God help us.Starring: Adam Sandler, Jennifer Aniston, Nick Swardson, Dan Patrick, Brooklyn Decker, Nicole Kidman, and Dave Matthews. Directed by: Dennis Dugan.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
If you like Adam Sandler and Happy Madison then this one's for you!!,"My wife and I watched this movie on Valentines Day. The way we decided on this movie was that we watched trailers for all the movies in our theater and this one stood out by far as the best.Once we started watching this movie I realized that this actually was gonna be a good pick for Valentines Day. It was a very well done Romantic-Comedy. I was just suspecting a full out comedy but was happy that the movie was the way it was even though I normally dislike most R-C's.The cast worked excellent together. Sandler was funny as usual and meshed very well with Jennifer Aniston. Nick Swardson is always a funny guy and lives up to that in this movie. Brooklyn Decker played her part to a tee, and the children added just the right touch to every scene they were in.This movie was a winner in my book. I am usually much more critical but there was just something about it. I will be at least renting when this comes out on DVD/Blu-Ray. Who knows...maybe i'll spend the $20 and buy this one. Go see it!

Actually Funny. Well Done,"Plastic Surgeon Danny (Sandler) picks up women by wearing a wedding band. Then, he meets someone he really likes, Palmer (Decker), and she won't have anything to do with a married man. He tells her he is getting a divorce and she buys it. Katherine (Aniston) agrees to be the fake divorcing wife and her kids also play along and the lies keep getting bigger and bigger. There was no end to them.I kept saying that most Hollywood comedies have their funny stuff up front in the beginning and then later anything comical is forgotten for the rest of the movie. Well, I have to qualify that statement. Oh, it's still true, but not for an Adam Sandler movie. He has a way to keep the yuks coming throughout. There is nothing overdone, silly, stupid (ok, well there were a couple silly things, but like I said in a Hollywood comedy silly and stupid are mandatory) or telegraphed where they become tedious and not funny in most other comedies. But this doesn't happen in a Adam Sandler movie. Many of his contemporaries should take note, especially the ones I keep saying should be selling used cars. And, Sandler even hires some of them for his movies and still they don't learn anything? Bummer.Sometimes a good comedy is based upon a lie, that keeps evolving and funny things can come out of subsequent misunderstandings, and half-truths. That is an old and true comedic formula and Sandler knows it, and he has enough sense to keep the funny things going on all the way through.I had to laugh out loud many times. Just had to do it. Take for example one of the kids who agrees to go along with the lie. She wants to project an English accent. So Danny says he wants to hear it first. So she goes, ""Heeeeeeellllo"" in a very exaggerated rather high English tone. Immediately, Danny says, ""No."" I was almost on the floor. Pure gold.I am quite leery of Hollywood comedies, but what kept me was the scene in the doctor's office when a woman came in who had an accident with one of her implants (it deflated). The conversation between Danny and his assistant Catherine sealed the deal for me and it was quite good. Yes, a little on the risqué side, but funny nevertheless. Hey, risqué can be funny if it's done right and this was. Hey, I just went with it. HA!The entire support cast performed well and Brooklyn Decker may become a very good actress. She held her own. You may have seen her in the recent SI Swimsuit issue.This was actually funny and better than the usual-not-funny Hollywood comedies. Well done.Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Sex Talk: Yes, mostly in the beginning Language: No f-bombs. A couple S-words were heard.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just Don't Bother,"Just Go With It sits in the middle of the best and worst Adam Sandler films this side of the millennium. Many, considerable pitfalls exists. Sandler piles on the lies to get his girl. Firstly, pretending to have an ex-wife (Jennifer Aniston), because Sandler gets caught wearing his old wedding ring that scores him many girls (in his dreams). Secondly, having two children when he has none. Thirdly, his cousin Nick Swardson enters the fray, pretending to be Aniston's new German backpacker boyfriend. The lies are awful and flimsy. The charade's kept up for the entire movie. It'd be convincing if Sandler was only trying to get his leg over. Some laughs come from it, just not many memorable ones. Aniston is the prize winner here. She's the good in a jumble of mess. This film is aptly named, as if it's telling us just to go with it too.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Really fun, and it has Jennifer Aniston","I absolutely love Jennifer Aniston and this was a perfect excuse to drool over her for almost two full hours. Other than that, I usually get the feeling that I'm too easily amused because, like with this movie, people often give me the ""meh, it's alright"" quick movie review, yet I was laughing so much at times I had trouble listening to the rest of the dialog. I had an amazing time watching this. Plus Adam and Jennifer have a knack for sounding like they're actually having a real conversation instead of being two actors reciting their parts of the script dramatically. I loved their characters. Also, the kids are really amazing, they come off as smart, witty and funny without sounding too much like your regular movie kids. If you're on the fence about this movie, by all means give it a chance.",,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly funny!,"I found this film infectiously funny and entertaining. Adam Sandler can be a bit hit & miss for me but here he is perfect, as is the lovely Jennifer Aniston, starting out as his homely lab assistant and then turning out all glammed up and as beautiful as we all know that she can be.Most enticing though, is model Brooklyn Decker, who is ravishing in every scene that she is in and soon is Danny McCabee's (Sandler) younger than he girlfriend. Danny is a successful L.A. plastic surgeon but still resorts to shady tactics to bed his dates. This tactic backfires with Palmer (Decker) and so a plan involving Katherine (Aniston) to pose as his soon-to-be divorced wife is hatched. Plus her real, currently fatherless two children (who are great!). The girl pretends to speak a mixture of Cockney and ""Royal"" English which is very funny and the boy wants to swim with dolphins - but cannot swim.The inclusion on the holiday of Nicole Kidman almost took things too far but they all bounced off each other well and there are some great scenes with just the three leads. Yes, it is contrived nonsense most of the time, including a ridiculous German-accented pretend husband (who sells sheep online for a living) for Katherine and a holiday to Hawaii. But this mixture of exotic locations, fun, slight sauciness and good-fun banter (plus some swim-suited glamour) make for a heady mix of great entertainment. I almost want to see it again.....",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Actually Better Than I Expected,"For me Adam Sandler is a real hit or miss guy in his own productions. Often I am not all that impressed. This picture had some really funny moments that were even funnier because they came across so natural. I find so many comedies fall way short of being funny comedies because too often they seem like most tv sitcoms that you can see the humor a long way away as it's being delivered.The children in this were great too. Each child turned out to be really savvy negotiators, and little con artists to boot. The way they squeezed Sandler was some of the funniest parts of the movie. Jennifer Anniston is really great in most comedies I've seen her in. She really has great timing when playing off Sandler...",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

The story-telling is so nice that even though every thing seems quiet predictable, it still grips you to the end. The acting was superb, I mean, Aniston, Sandler have both done a great job. I especially like the raunchy double-meaning dialogues which will make you laugh all the time. Brooklyn has also done a good job playing a role of a nice lady. Watch out for the curves and big coconuts of the ladies and the yellow bikini. Some scenes are quiet romantic and the chemistry between the actors are great.

A faking good comedy,"This film is a good comedy that made me chuckle quite a bit but only made me laugh out loud once or twice.In this film Adam Sandler plays a man called Daniel who is about to get married but then finds out that his future wife is cheating on him. He then goes to a bar to drown his sorrows and whilst still wearing his wedding ring he meets a girl and lies to her by saying that he has been married for a few years but his marriage is going bad and this causes the girl to feel sorry for him and sleep with him. Dan then realises that he can use this wedding ring to keep on pretending to be married and meet loads of girls. The film then goes forward about 10-20 years and Dan is now working as a plastic surgeon with his assistant, Katherine (Jennifer Aniston) and he meets a girl (Palmer - Brooklyn Decker) who he doesn't want to lie to about being married because he thinks she is his soulmate. But then Palmer finds Dan's wedding ring and Dan decides to tell Palmer that he is married but is going through a divorce. Palmer then asks to meet his wife to confirm this so Dan asks Katherine to pretend to be his wife and the film gets funnier and funnier as Dan has to keep lieing to pretend that he is not only married but also has children.One of the funniest bits in the film is at the beginning when Dan and Katherine meet loads of people who have had either too much plastic surgery or something has gone wrong with their plastic surgery. This includes one woman who has had a boob job but one boob is much bigger than the other and a man who has had loads of Botox and has no feeling left in his face.Like I said in my description of the film when Palmer meets Katherine, who is a single mum, she gets a phone call from her children and Dan, then has to lie and say they're his children. Palmer and Dan then agree to go on a holiday and take Katherine and her kids with them so they can all get to know eachother better. From then on Daniel has to keep lying to pretend that he has a wife and kids. And it still makes me laugh when I look back at the film and think about all the lies that he told.The film also gets funny when Dan's brother, Eddie (Nick Swardson) pretends to be Katherine's new boyfriend and this lead to everyone else lying to keep Dan happy.There is a bit at the end of this film where it gets a bit too romantic but overall I did find this film really funny and would enjoy watching it again on Netflix but I don't think I would buy it on DVD unless it was cheap.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
So Funny,"This kept me laughing the whole time but I must say no clinic, practice nor hospital have only two persons as their main staff. Wished Danny's clinic was more realistic.I had concerns with the pregnant lady who got hit by a cup of drink while the Quartet were walking towards the kids amusement park. I thought that was scary. It was an expensive joke that shouldn't have been at all. It wasn't necessary and that scene could have still worked great without it.My favorite scene would be Aniston and Sandler shopping for items, especially when Aniston was trying out the pretty shoes.Danny: How much are these?Attendant: $1,700.Danny: $1,700, what; do you come with them?It was hilarious.I was quite touched when the little girl said: ""Don't worry, we never have fun with our real dad either.""I so felt it! Was never close to my dad as a child. Was terrified of him till I became a teenager. But at adulthood, I got to understand him a bit better and likewise him but time was no longer on his side and before I knew it, he was gone.Parents should endeavor to spend much time with their kids while they still can because they grow up so fast and eventually move on with their lives.In all, watching this really uplifted my spirit.

Just Go With It is a wild, goofy ride with wacky characters and stupid situations that will have you laughing from start to finish. However, the sheer nonsensical plot eventually gives way to a sweet story of love being found even in the most unlikely ways and places.

I hate to be so hard on him because Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore were gold. But this movie is just a major waist of time. Even the gratuitous shots of Any Roddick's wife weren't enough to carry even the slightest interest in the plot.

Sorry Adam & Jennifer - You've wasted 2 hours of my life,"Whilst I wouldn't regard myself as a Sandler fan, I've watched most of his films over the years, and some are even excellent to barely acceptable - a fairly good record considering the amount he has put out since he started. Just Go With It, well, I won't mince my words is just atrociously bad - badly acted, badly directed, badly scripted. In fact I would go far as to say this was my razzie awards film of the year. I guess the clue was already in the title, possibly pleading fans for patience whilst watching it. Sorry Adam & Jennifer, this was sheer self- indulgent dribble, poor and very weak. How the hell Nicole Kidman got caught up in his script, beggars belief or any decision of good common sense. Was she forcibly made to do this? I see no other reason for her wanting this role. The script is so full of utter implausibilities, so stupidly riddled with holes, (not at all funny as Sandler can be), I felt insulted, violated, when watching this film, squandering 2 precious hours of my life which could have been occupied with much anything else - that's how meaningless of any entertainment value I think this piece of utter junk is worth.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

There is amazing connection between Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston, which is critical for the film's success. There are so many funny scenes, I laughed so hard at a few of them, such as Palmer being pushed into the pool and the coconut scene. Nicole Kidman has a small but memorable role, which sees her in situations (involving the coconut as well) which I would not have imagined a mega star to agree to filming.

In the world such misses only then trades the destiny.,"This is an unbearable film both in terms of plot and technique. The scumbag actor Danny accidentally discovered the secret of picking a girl suitable for him after his youth was frustrated. The sisters around me are one after another, one for each race, and of course, the office colleagues who coexist with each other every day. The images of the girls in the film fully reflect the public's aesthetics, especially the young men. Everywhere is filled with vulgar and there are some jokes that are not particularly funny, as if the director ordered the actors, the actors in turn tickled the audience.But this is a very good movie, telling a story of love and finding true love.Bizarre plots, dozens of seemingly random and unreasonable events rushed in, so they had the opportunity to understand each other-although some of them have known each other for a long time, they are still strange. Our scumbag actor, at this time has been upgraded from ""A Thousand Flowers"" to a winner in life, fascinated by the two girls. Everything seems to be going according to plan, it's just ""plan-B"".Perhaps without Palmer, Danny may continue his previous life, and will not think of finding someone to marry, nor will he accidentally show Katherine his good man, good husband and good father, these exaggerated chances come together , Is life, is life.The ending is as happy as Bollywood in India.

Just Go with It — A romantic comedy about a well meaning escalation of lies,"Just Go with It is one of those romantic comedy that goes the silly way to try to prove that you need to commit to be happy, with the main character chasing the right girl the wrong way getting deeper and deeper into trouble.The story is interesting, but it's a standard escalation of lies and attempts to maintain the fiction. The best acting performance is given by Jennifer Aniston. Adam Sandler does himself credit for making us laugh without resorting to his early career antics, but he has done better. Nicole Kidman is not at her best, but I suspect the role and probably the directorial inputs she was given are responsible for the result.

This movie didn't have a single shred of honesty or humanity. The plot seemed to come directly from some Microsoft program that creates boilerplate scenarios for lame romantic comedies. And why does every movie have to be about rich creeps?

Chaos In Hawaii,"On the surface ""Just Go With It"" is just another Adam Sandler critic hate fest, however, Sandler is one of the best modern comedians and brings home the laughs once again. The film is actually based on the 1969 film ""Cactus Flower"" which received its roots from the French play ""Fleur de cactus"". However, besides the basic plot outline, Adam Sandler's version is vastly different including his trademark crazy, rude, over the top humor. Needless to say Sandler has not lost his way. Sandler's character Danny Maccabee has his heart broken by his fiancé on his wedding day. This leads him to a bar where he is found sulking while still wearing his wedding ring. He discovers that while every other guy in the bar strikes out attempting to hit on Joanna Damon (Minka Kelly, ""The Roommate"", ""Gossip Girl""), his wedding ring attracts her to him. This combined with a made up story about how his wife beats him makes her feel bad for him and ultimately sleeping with him. His success leads him to continue his scheme even after becoming a wealthy plastic surgeon, until he meets a woman named Palmer (Brooklyn Decker). She gets extremely upset after finding his wedding ring in his pocket the morning after sleeping with him demanding an explanation. He tells her that he is in the process of getting a divorce and asks his best lady friend and assistant Katherine Murphy (Jennifer Anistan) to act as if she was his wife (soon to be ex). His lie grows more and more that Danny convinces Katherine's kids, Maggie (Bailee Madison, ""Brothers"") and Michael (Griffin Gluck) to play the role of his kids. Everything culminates in a ""family"" trip to Chaos Hawaii with Danny, Palmer, Katherine, Maggie, Michael and Danny's cousin Eddie (Nick Swardson), where (throughout the chaos) Danny finds out that his heart is actually taking him towards the woman that knows him best.Adam Sandler has been creating very unique romantic comedies for years that are able to reach out to a wider audience. ""Just Go With It"" is most definitely a romantic comedy, however, it does not stick it in your face. Instead the film slowly lets the viewer know that the rom-com is there allowing it to have a lot of fun. This is also achieved by creating characters that are all very likable and not stereotypical. Even Katherine's nemesis, Devlin, played by Nicole Kidman turns out to be a very likable character. Lastly, what does every Adam Sandler film need? Well Adam Sandler' mastery of creating good entertainment.The film starts off on a really weak note with very little relevance to the rest of the film. After the opening segment relevance grows, however, the film doesn't really get going until the whole ""family"" goes to Hawaii. This creates a very stereotypical cliché experience. Everything in the film has been done before leaving no surprises except some random undeveloped comical interjections which have become a pattern in the past couple years.The film's ending is very predictable, however, Director Dennis Dugan does not throw it in your face allowing the viewer to enjoy the humor of Adam Sandler. This is one of the most entertaining comedies that has come out in a while so ""Just Go To It"" now.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just Go With It,If you are in the mood for a relaxing movie filled with good laughs I would definitely suggest seeing Just Go With It. Its suitable for old and young alike. The plot line is entertaining and every character contributes some laughs. The crazy events that occur throughout the movie keep you entertained. More lies bring more jokes and by the end it can be hard to keep track yet it's still understandable. Adam and Jennifer don't disappoint as its a classic romantic comedy. It's definitely one to buy and keep for a boring Saturday night. Its a happy ending filled with hilarious moments. It is definitely worth the 10 dollars!!,7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Perfect Embodiment of a NICE Movie,"Adam Sandler's last few movie efforts were a tough way to spend a couple of hours. This is the exact opposite, delivering quite a few pleasant and amusing moments. I'd call this film the perfect embodiment of a ""nice"" movie. Nothing extraordinary or laugh out loud funny but the number of chuckles and amusing situations do add up. It has heart and characters that are genuine and likable. Sure, some of the decisions Sandler's character makes defy logic and even common sense but who goes to his films seeking reason and logic? Sitcom type situations hammered in to the film somehow works with this cast. The one level where the film operates above the ""nice"" or average range is on the superficial but enjoyable girl watching level. Yes, film fans often rave about breathtaking cinematography but I can't say I've seen any sunset or landscape shot that rivals the shear beauty of watching Brooklyn Decker glide across screen in slow motion. Add Jennifer Aniston in various tight outfits and in a ""Hula-off"" with Nicole Kidman and the babe factor is as elevated as can be. Again, an enjoyable way to spend a few hours.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Not a good romantic comedy, but it is funny and romantic","""Just Go with It"" has Adam Sandler trying his hand at his ladies man shtick rather than his immature man-child routine. The result is a somewhat mature (not to be confused with intelligent) romantic comedy, rather than a zany screwball comedy. I like most romantic comedies no matter how pedantic and unoriginal they may be as long as they are funny and romantic too. And this one is all of the above.Danny (Adam Sandler) has long since discovered that a wedding ring and a sob story can go a long way towards picking up women. But then he meets Palmer (Brooklyn Decker) and she's supposed to be different. We can't actually tell why she's more special than the others, they just have to tell us that since subtlety is not a strong point here. The best part about Decker, the 20-something model, is that she gets showed up by Jennifer Aniston, who in turn, gets half-showed up by Nicole Kidman. There's something almost poetic about Hollywood's universe inadvertently becoming backwards.""Just Go with It"" is as predictable as they get and far from original but it kept me amused and Sandler's light humour kept me smiling. It certainly isn't a good romantic comedy (which, believe it or not, does exist), but it was exactly as I expected it to be. I enjoyed it, but then again I like Jennifer Aniston and I think Adam Sandler is funny.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Turned the brain off, got a few chuckles, nothing original here","This had occasional humorous moments from another forgettable Adam Sandler comedy. Here he teams up with Jennifer Aniston -which was bound to happen sooner or later since she makes the same romantic comedy over and over again as well.Here Sandler is a plastic surgeon who enlists the help of his loyal assistant (Aniston) to pretend to be his (soon to be) ex-wife to help him woo a much younger schoolteacher and everyone ends up in Hawaii (because Sandler has admitted that's where he likes to film movies).Anyways the plots not really important, its a pretty silly movie with some terribly unfunny (stupid) dialogue. Some of the messed up plastic surgeries did give me a chuckle, but this just tried too hard and didn't succeed. Zero chemistry between Sandler and Aniston, who both portray the same characters we've seen from them in all their other movies along with a clichéd plot and just too long in general.I'm not sure what Nicole Kidman was doing here but she must have had fun with her role even if her hula/coconut scene went on about 10 minutes too long. 03.13",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sooooo brilliant!,"One word; WOW. This is by far my favourite film of all time! The script is absolutely fantastic and it's very very funny. There are times when you laugh, there are times when you go 'aw!', and there are times when you can really relate to what the characters are saying, and, being 12, I found it extremely heart-warming and hilarious. Also living in England, I thought Maggie's British accent was spot on, although it was kinda stereotyped. My mum bought me the DVD of it today, and I'm really happy because, since it's not playing on Sky anymore, I can laugh again and again. I'd recommend this film to anyone who likes a good laugh and an 'aw' moment! I think the cast is absolutely brilliant and they just have this on screen chemistry that adds to the film's fabulousness, especially Bailee and Griffin. I'm just in love with this film, and I use 'Devlin' every time I go to the loo now, :)! A definite 10/10!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Just go see it, romcom and Sandler fans, and take some folks with you","Dr. Danny (Adam Sandler) was jilted long ago, on his wedding day, when he overheard his fiancée telling her bridesmaids about her recent infidelities and non-love for Danny. Seems she only wanted security. Ever since, Danny, a plastic surgeon, has told any female interest who comes his way that he is married but getting a divorce, etc. This allows him to romance a number of women without getting involved. The one lady who has remained constant in his life is his personal assistant, Katherine (Jennifer Anniston). She supports him at work and with every trouble. However, she is a divorcée with two children to support so she is in search of a ""good man"" herself. One day, Danny meets the young woman of his dreams, Palmer (Brooklyn Decker), a caring teacher 15 years his junior. But, after a night on the beach, she finds his wedding ring in his pocket and assumes he is a lying you-know-what. To make her realize he IS married and that he and his wife are having problems, he asks Katherine to ""pretend"" to be his married partner and have a lunch between the three of them, so Palmer can verify that it is ""over"". But, naturally, a more complicated web springs forth, for Kate has to take a call from one of her kids at the end of the meal and now Palmer knows there are children involved. Soon, Danny has to arrange a meeting with Kate's whole family, but, the doctor has to bribe the kids into making it look real. Before long, everyone is off to Hawaii for a vacation, where Kate runs into an old back-stabbing sorority gal, Devlin (Nicole Kidman). So, now Kate ""pretends"" that Danny is HER husband, so Devlin, married to a phone inventor, can see that a plastic surgeon is good fishing, too. When will the secrets tumble out and, could it be, that Danny may be developing an interest in Kate, much to his surprise? This very loose adaptation of Cactus Flower is a charmer. There are many funny lines and the cast is great, with the main principals and supporting actors doing fine work. No, Sandler is not a cookie cutter romantic lead but he is man of many talents, no doubt. Also, the scenery is wonderful, as are the costumes, with Aniston looking so good, you want to check her driver's license. Ditto for Kidman. The photography, script and direction are more than winning as well. If you are looking for a new romantic comedy, don't shy away from this one, you will be entertained. On the other hand, if you are a Sandler aficianado, you will find it right up your alley, too.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Worth Watching,"I don't always appreciate the comedy style of Adam Sandler, even though I think he is very funny. But like some of his best films, ""Just Go with It"" is not full of juvenile humor. Still, this romcom is much more about comedy than romance, and it contains some big laughs. Unfortunately, the story is uneven and it drags a few times.Sandler plays a plastic surgeon named Danny who enjoys playing the field and likes to pretend he is married as a ploy to attract women. When he meets a younger woman he is genuinely interested in (Brooklyn Decker), and she discovers his wedding band, he makes up a story that won't scare her off. This leads down a long rabbit hole of lies, and requires that he enlist others in his deception, like his assistant, Katherine (Jennifer Anistan)---and her children.The title refers to the basic tenet of improvisation, which becomes his mantra as he tries to negotiate the tangled web of long-term deception. The best moments of the film are the scenes where Danny finds himself digging a deeper hole of lies to bolster his initial deception.Bailee Madison, who plays Katherine's daughter Maggie, steals her scenes, which are some of the best in the film. Also watch for Nicole Kidman, Dave Matthews, Rachel Dratch, and a barely recognizable Kevin Nealon.Like ""50 First Dates"", this is an Adam Sandler film that is worth seeing and actually has moments where it tugs at the heartstrings.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Nutshell Review: Just Go With It,"Director Dennis Dugan was responsible for a number of comedies with funnyman Adam Sandler, from Happy Gilmore to Big Daddy in the 90s, to the more recent fare of I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry, You Don't Mess with the Zohan, and Grown Ups. I'm a big fan of some of these if I may say low brow offerings, but hey, don't berate me for having a good time. As with most of the comedies Sandler has starred in thus far, most straddle between two broad areas of being funny, and yet having some major drama and/or romantic fare to bulk up the running time, making the films seem more like two halves put together.And Just Go With It is no different. Based on a French stage play and an earlier film called Cactus Flower in the 60s (hence making this a modern day remake of sorts), this movie has both all out, riotous scenes designed to make you laugh, yet having depth following a tried and tested formula for a romance, which gets catalyzed by a little white lie that grows out of control, needing as one character puts it, an index card to keep track of the sprawling tales they have to tell and keep at in order to not puncture their respective ruses.So the comedy here involves lies and truths, with Adam Sandler's renowned plastic surgeon Danny finding out the power of sympathy and the sex that comes with it with his wearing of a wedding ring, only that he hasn't got married just yet, playing on how some swingers just love to get it going with married men. Just when he's serious about Palmer (Brooklyn Decker), a really young girl for his age, she finds that wedding band, and he cooks up the story that he's actually getting a divorce. Palmer needing proof meant Danny's persuasion (with benefits in kind) of his assistant / reception Katherine (Jennifer Aniston), a divorcée with two kids, to pose as his soon to be ex-wife, and then roping in her children Maggie (Bailee Madison) and Michael (Griffin Gluck) to pose as his as well.And it goes two ways, since Katherine has a thing about her rival from school for many years (I shall not name this A-list actress so as not to spoil the surprise on her comedic performance, so don't go up looking IMDb.com, OK?), and uses her pretense with Danny to try and keep up with the Joneses. Needless to say their scheme of being husband and wife means to keep up with the multitude of lies for each different scenario, either Danny's or Katherine's, which naturally lead to some fun scenarios. But the funniest of course belongs to that between Sandler, Madison and Gluck, one who decides to ham it up with a British accent, while the other is just plain sombre, and their tip top act as the father-children draws countless of laughter since Danny often finds himself being blackmailed by the kids, who are doing a perfect job. The photo taking scene on the golf course is priceless, and possibly one of the funniest in the film.Then comes the dramatic, romantic half, where you can see it coming from a mile away when both Sandler and Aniston's Danny and Katherine come on screen, with their banter, the premise, the setup and such all spelling f-o-r-m-u-l-a, and you'll just about know what happens between them. The romance between Danny and Palmer then looked like a shade of Ben Stiller's The Heartbreak Kid in a way, and like many other romantic comedies like Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Hawaii serves as the perfect backdrop for friendships and relationships to unravel, and also to provide the Hilton hotel another major product placement opportunity after Up in the Air.A film like this will never steer clear of toilet humour, and they are here by the truckloads. Yes it's lowbrow sometimes, but a great way to de-stress after a hard day's work, since you know exactly what you're in for, and the film delivers just that.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Disappointing and Unfunny Comedy,"In 1988, in Long Island, the future cardiologist Danny Maccabee (Adam Sandler) overhears the nasty conversation of his wife-to-be and her friends on his wedding day about his big nose, his family and himself and he calls off their wedding. Danny becomes a womanizer and uses his wedding ring to lie to women and get laid.Twenty-three years later, Dr. Maccabee is a well succeeded plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills that still uses his wedding ring to get women to bed. When he meets the younger mathematic teacher Palmer (Brooklyn Decker) in a party, they have one night stand on the beach and Danny has a crush on her. But Palmer finds his wedding ring on his pocket and he lies to her, telling that he is divorcing from his wife. Palmer asks to meet his wife, and Danny asks to his long-time assistant Katherine (Jennifer Aniston) to pose as his wife. Katherine accepts, but things get more complicated when Katherine, who is a single mother, receives a phone call from her daughter and Palmer learns that they have two children and asks to meets them. Now Danny bribes the two children to travel to Hawaii to spend a couple of days together knowing each other.When they are at the airport, Danny's friend Eddie (Nick Swardson) unexpectedly joins them telling that he is Katherine's boyfriend expecting to travel to Hawaii with the expenses paid by Danny. The group arrives in a fancy hotel where Katherine meets her university foe Devlin Adams (Nicole Kidman) that is lodged at the same hotel.The overrated ""Just Go with It"" is a disappointing and unfunny comedy with Jennifer Aniston, Adam Sandler and Nicole Kidman. The absurd and unethical story if awful and even Adam Sandler seems to be irritated with a poor performance. His unconvincing character is a liar and womanizer, capable to bribe children to keep his lies and to marry a woman that he has seduced using successive lies without any moral value or ethics. His assistant Katherine not only accepts to participate in the scheming to lure his girlfriend, but also allows her children to be bribed and accepts the invitation of her enemy to have dinner together. Palmer is a moron capable to believe on the most unrealistic stories. His best friend is a complete dummy and disloyal, capable to take advantage of a situation to travel with his expenses on Danny.There are the usual exaggerations of the contemporary Hollywood productions, with Danny expending lots of money in fancy and fashionable boutiques and in the suites of the hotel. Further to the unrealistic plot and unlikable characters, the jokes are silly in times when moral values seem to be less important than an easy senseless laugh. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""Esposa de Mentirinha"" (""Fake Wife"")",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Another Window into Extravagant Tinsletown,"Although Sandler's sophomoric antics are obviously drawn from a pool of at least limited capabilities, often the viewer wonders if it is talent or just connections that get him into so many films. The formula is so thin from overuse that it's frayed edges are often the most perceptible substance. Adam, you're just not handsome enough to play Romeo in romp after romp. In this, his two Juliet's are both such shallowly perfect physical specimens as to leave the viewer wondering if the conspicuous consumerism so often the hallmark of Hollywood is not eclipsed by the shameless superficiality. Besides blonds with bursting boobs we are also treated to plastic surgery jokes, grating foreign accents of several flavors and inevitable gay bashing.

liked it because of the sandler-aniston chemistry,"This movie really wasn't that funny. It had some funny parts that made me laugh out loud, but the person behind me got a lot bigger kick out of it then I did.However, I enjoyed the film. It's worth watching because of the dynamic between aniston and sandler. In this film you believe these to people could really make good mates for each other.It was a good part for aniston. She wasn't the gorgeous chick in this at all and had to endure old jokes from a much younger cast member. (I actually don't remember when aniston was the hot chick in any movies but I feel like she was at one point...whatever). Her character is believable. I was moved by it for whatever reason. Kind of makes you feel like Aniston was playing herself for the bit with the exception of the children...though she looked good with them.and I believe the reason why the chemistry between sandler and aniston was so good was because they are the SAME AGE!!! (that did wonders for the plot and story line...you know, made it worth watching...made it believable..I think we can thank Happy Madison Productions for that).Pretty tired of films where the male lead ends up with a girl 20 years his senior. Just doesn't do it for me. This one is an exception to that rule and bravo to Aniston for taking the part and bravo to Sandler for giving it to her.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Funnnier than expected,I am not a huge Adam Sandler fan but I enjoyed this one mainly because the screenplay is good and it doesn't rely too much on Sandler. The other cast members provide most of the funny lines. Jennnifer is quite attractive even next to the much younger Brooklyn Decker who incidentally is quite an adequate actress. The cute little girl Bailee Madison is a charming scene stealer her accent is much better than Selena Gomez in Monte Carlo (for anyone who has seen the disappointing Monte Carlo). The story is pleasant and funny without being obvious or corny or cringe inducing. There are many laugh out loud moments and most characters are likable except Eddie played by Nick Swardson who is a little annoying. Overall enjoyable and worth watching.,,Anonymous,Romance
"Solid Romantic Comedy, but Lacking Adam Sandler's Storytelling Charm","Just Go With It was a fairly entertaining watch all the way through, however there was a lot of storytelling substance that felt like it was missing from most movies Adam Sandler is in. While Sandler was not a writer on the film, he was a producer, and thus had clear influence on the film.The story summed up all its parts in a fairly satisfying way, but did not leave the viewers (me specifically) with any powerful message or content that would make the film re-watchable. Just a solid, enjoyable romantic comedy. I would leave a higher review (7 or 8) because of how well the cinematography, editing, storytelling was, but due to the weird soundtrack choice (some pop classics that were remixed) that really took you out of the moment, as well as the more basic plotline, it dropped my review down to a 6.Overall, worth the watch if you're an Adam Sandler/Jennifer Aniston fan, but otherwise a slightly above-average romantic comedy that is good for a one time watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Still the goofy Sandler tropes but can be wholesome too,"Sometimes it can be hard for people to be easy going. Some people require lots of preparation to do a task such as time, physical readiness and mental justification. Others can just jump right in with no questions asked in order to do what someone needs. There's usually no in between when it comes to this. Of course there are other factors like how devoted one is to the person making the request. If it's some random person or if the ask seems highly unrealistic to accomplish, hesitation can set in for anyone. Faking one's own story though is not that farfetched as it may seem. Many people have taken different identities and went completely under the radar. This is kind of what this Adam Sandler film is about except for sillier reasons.Directed by Dennis Dugan, known for working with Adam Sandler in his other films. The story is a modernized remake of I. A. L. Diamond's Cactus Flower (1969). The story follows Danny (Sandler), a successful plastic surgeon who was left at the alter at a young age when he was supposed to be married. In turn, he used his ring (the only memorabilia left) to get into the pants every chick he came across. That is until he happens to cross paths with Palmer (Brooklyn Decker) who he feels he has a connection with. However instead of using his ring to at the beginning, Palmer discovers it only after. This then has Danny make up a story that he's divorcing his current wife so Palmer doesn't leave him. With that he asks his assistant Katherine (Jennifer Aniston) to play that role.The screenplay was adapted by Timothy Dowling and Allan Loeb, both of which surprisingly did not have a hand in any Adam Sandler films before it. Without prior viewing of the original film that this is a remake of and is likely better, as most are, the overall experience is a fair one. Going back to what was mentioned earlier, changing identities is very much a possibility but only some of it gets by super easy. Asking someone you work with to pose as someone else doesn't seem that hard to do. However, when Katherine has to include her son Michael (Griffin Gluck) and daughter Maggie (Bailee Madison), that's just pushing the believability. But that's not even the end of it. On top of that, Danny's cousin Eddie (Nick Swardson) shows up as well just because he wanted to see the girl of Danny's dreams in real time.This kind of stretching the truth is where it just gets ridiculous. How are people this gullible and believe such nonsense so easily? To the film's credit, not all the comedy is average. The moments where it's not good is Adam Sandler's low brow kind of humor for various scenes but they aren't over the top in this one either. The comedic elements that do work in this movie's favor are the more wholesome related bits. Deep down, like the main character there is a wholesome core to the film and that's the comedic element that is well received. Usually that kind of moment is when it comes to Danny working with Michael and Maggie. There's also other actor appearances such as Nicole Kidman playing one Katherine's high school rivals. There's also Dave Matthews playing the husband to Kidman's role and Kevin Nealon.The acting in general is fine for the production. No actor sounds like they don't know how to stay in character. The director of photography for this picture was Theo van de Sande. This is the same person who filmed for the forgettable Volcano (1997) but also the one and only Blade (1998). For what's shown on the screen, the backgrounds look fine. Being that majority of this movie's setting takes place in Hawaii, the shots are very scenic and capture lush shorelines. The music was a bit of disappointment though as it was composed by Rupert Gregson-Williams. Williams who also frequently works with Sandler would think an album could be produced but no such thing. Yet he went on to bring Wonder Woman (2017) a tune everyone would remember.Comedy as usual for a Sandler film is hit and miss as does the music remain largely generic. The story while a bit unrealistic at points is not completely ludicrous either. There are moments of heart, the camerawork is good and the actors all perform fine.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Awful just isn't a strong enough word,"God awful. I would appreciate it if the film industry didn't capitulate to the demand for horrendous endeavours such as this one. This ""movie"" makes Matthew McConaughey look like Daniel Day Lewis, and Fool's Gold like Citizen Kane. Overall, I am hard pressed to blame Hollywood and the screen play writers for producing this farce of a plot, as the people inexplicably yearn for such cringe worthy clichés and egregious character development, and back stories. The much lauded and acclaimed acting performances of Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston culminate in this 'piece de resistance', unlikely to be bettered this millennia.

A Tropical Sandler Classic,"I remember my first time watching this flick. I was probably 11 or 12. I remember dealing with a ""mystery illness"" at the time that turned out to be nothing my anxiety. However, it consumed me and left me feeling depressed and anxious most days. I remember my mom or dad took me to the local blockbuster when that was a thing. A tradition we used to have that I look back on dearly. They always let me pick a movie or sometimes two. I saw this on the shelf and I couldn't tell you what I was thinking when I grabbed it. But I imagine, given the fact that I'm sucker for anything beach related, it had to do with the tropical scenery that caught my eye. We rented it and it quickly brought me right out of my depressive slump. I watched it over and over and I laughed and I laughed. My parents laughed. I haven't shown this movie to anyone that hasn't like it. Is it perfectly written? No. But it hold a very special place in my heart and has always been a feel good movie for me. I still find it funny to this day and I can still rely on it to bring me some joy on days where I could use it. For me, it's the beautiful scenery, and the chemistry between Sandler and Aniston that makes this a hit for me. On top of that, Swardson is HILARIOUS in this movie. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a mindless, fun, late night tropical rom com.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"In the Lie, they found the Truth","Just Go With It is about a good-hearted plastic surgeon (Adam Sandler) who likes pretending he is married to get women unexpectedly finds that in order to land the 23-year old blonde of his dreams (Brooklyn Decker, a former model) he needs to fabricate an entire family an an impending divorce. This he does with the help of his assistant (Jennifer Aniston) and her kids. Though the rom-com formula dictates that the elaborate ruse must have Sandler and Aniston falling in love, the fully formed story creates a surprising amount of tension by not making the 23-year old blonde a disposable airhead.

Fun film for everyone.,Adam Sandler stars in a film whose original version was released six years earlier in India under the name of Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya. Once again we can see the immense lack of ideas in Hollywood and therefore the insatiable tendency to copy or adapt hits from distant countries. In this case we have Sandler who in a simulation plot decides to invite his assistant (Anniston) to fulfill an ideal role in order to surprise his beautiful and young girlfriend. There are very good secondary actors where the unpleasant character of Nicole Kidman stands out. There are several elements to highlight but beyond some good Sandler jokes who does it best is Nick Swardson who steals the movie. It is an entertaining film since it has elements of interest for everyone.,7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Surprisingly good, though quite typical.","Let me start out by saying that I'm by no means an Adam Sandler fan, not so much because of him but mainly because of his choices in acting as well as his co-actors (I absolutely despised 'Grown Ups' with Kevin James and the ever-so abysmal Rob Schneider, as well as 'Waterboy'). As such I had no expectations to the quality of 'Just Go With It' whatsoever. And on the surface I should've probably hated this movie as the overall plot, and especially the plot development, is no different than any other romantic comedy: *SPOILER*(or not so much a spoiler, actually) - Man meets girl, falls in love with girl, gets help from female friend, falls in love with female friend. Ring any bells?So it comes as no surprise that it is not the plot that drives the movie, but rather the chemistry between the three main characters Dannie, Kathrine and Eddie. It feels right, and not for a single second was I bored (not for more than a few minutes at least). Quite an achievement taken the movie's incredible length. The script really saved the movie for me, and only major low-point is the clichéd ending (and Sandler's role. What is the deal with Adam Sandler. He is by no means a super attractive man and neither a bad-ass... still he tends to play both - One of Hollywood's greatest mysteries).Admitted, I laughed a lot even though I saw it by myself. Swardson's character is awesome - again a typical character who's saved by a great script. And this goes for almost everything about the film. Truly a great enjoyment, though not my type of movie at ALL. So... I guess the only thing left to say is ""Just Go With It"" (corny, I know).",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

10 out of 10,Hands-down one of the best romantic comedy movies ever!,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fuin for all,"Well now, my review hath disappeared. Let's give it another shot, shall we? Adam Sandler plays a surgeon who flies to Hawaii accompanied by his assistant (Aniston), whom he asks to pose as his ex-wife. Don't ask. Ultimately, he plans to marry his girlfriend (Decker), who is 20 years his junior. While in Hawaii, Aniston runs across an old college foe, the haughty (and barely recognizable) Nicole Kidman, and pretends to be married to Sandler to tweak her rival. Complications obviously ensue. Lots of funny bits, including an hysterical hula contest that turns into a showdown between Aniston and Kidman. We have to pretend that Aniston isn't the most attractive woman on Earth, as her character here is divorced and has two children. She and Sandler have wonderful chemistry, I might add. And the ending is a hoot. Good movie for grownups, which is rare these days.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
No...don't go with it,"Adam Sandler movies are hit or miss; they're either pretty damn funny or they're not very funny at all (saving for his attempts to do some serious stuff here and there). This one kind of fell flat. Sandler is a doc who gets cruelly dumped on his wedding day by his superficial bride to be and decides the only way to heal his broken heart is to become a superficial jackass himself, by bedding women who are much too young and pretty to ever really give a guy like that a second look, much less time in the sack. You're supposed to sympathize with him because he WAS treated unfairly by the gal he was about to marry but you just can't. He's too snarky and self serving so it's hard to actually root for him. He hatches a plan to use his assistant, played by Jennifer Aniston, to bag a young supermodel chick (Brooklyn Decker) who's so far out of his league it's laughable. Unfortunately, Aniston is back on screen again portraying the exact same ""hey, look at me! I'm a cool, laid back chick with a breezy attitude towards life so you should just love me"" Rachel-type character that she's played in just about every movie she's ever been in (with the exception of the wonderfully acted ""The Good Girl""). Nick Swardson is along for the ride as Sandler's dippy friend who provides a few laughs along the way but little else and the young actors who portray Aniston's kids are kind of grating after a short while. Nicole Kidman has a small role as Aniston's nemesis from previous years gone by, but her character is so two-dimensional and silly that it's obvious she's brought in only to be used as a filler in a dumb back story involving Aniston's long suffering character Katherine's past. The highlight of this story is the stunning Hawaiian scenery but that's all. This isn't the worst film I've ever seen but it's certainly one of the worst Adam Sandler movies I've had to sit through. He can be absolutely hilarious (Anger Management, I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry, etc.) but this one kind of bites.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Deception-Based Farce Gone Through the Sandler Blender,"There is no getting around the fact that Jennifer Aniston is likable. In the past, she has attempted to be versatile with mixed results (effective in ""The Good Girl"", less so as a temptress in ""Derailed""), but she remains most successful within a limited proximity of her Rachel Green character from the long-running ""Friends"" TV series. She's playing another variation of her in this rambunctious 2011 comedy ever so loosely based on the amiable 1969 farce, ""Cactus Flower"" starring Walter Matthau, Ingrid Bergman, and Goldie Hawn in her Oscar-winning debut. Believe it or not, Aniston is playing the Bergman role of Katherine, a single mom working as an assistant to Danny, a successful LA plastic surgeon played by Adam Sandler. The fact that Sandler is playing the Matthau role appears to be the primary joke here since he turns the excessively inventive single doctor into one of his standard wiseacre man-boy characters.The movie opens with a flashback scene in which a pre-nose-job Danny discovers he is about to marry a shrew but soon realizes his gold band is a magnet for hot chicks. He then decides to avoid what he thinks is the inevitable disappointment of commitment by telling every girl he hooks up with that he's married. That ploy changes when he meets a blonde stunner named Palmer. He falls for her, but things start to fall apart when she discovers Danny's gold band in his pocket and assumes he's married. Convinced that Palmer is the one, Danny persuades Katherine to pretend to be his soon-to-be-ex-wife and uses her two manipulative kids as part of the charade. Things go according to formula, including a contrived trip to Hawaii where Katherine runs into a college sorority rival named Devlin, who has been the subject of Katherine's passive-aggressive hostilities all these years. In a bit of stunt casting, Nicole Kidman plays the ultra-competitive Devlin in a comically imperious fashion, while singer/musician Dave Matthews is arbitrarily thrown in the mix as her equally shallow, butt-clenching husband.Even though this comedy is neither as consistently funny nor tightly structured as ""Cactus Flower"", I have to admit there is a bit of a Cary Grant/Irene Dunne-type of banter between Aniston and Sandler, at least during the first half when Katherine is introduced to Palmer as Danny's confident, materialistic wife (she names herself ""Devlin""). These are the scenes that hew closest to the original movie and consequently work the best. Where it flounders is when the two actors need to show they are falling in love. Sandler is a relative blank slate during these more serious moments, and the lack of credibility in their characters' romantic relationship undermines the film. In the Goldie Hawn role, Brooklyn Decker fulfills the physical requirements as Palmer but is unlikely to be up for any Oscars this time next year. Nick Swardson wins my award for the year's most irritating best buddy in a Sandler comedy, especially when he pretends to be Katherine's lover, an Austrian sheep buyer. Sandler's former SNL colleagues Rachel Dratch and an almost unrecognizable Kevin Nealon show up in cameos as two comically unfortunate victims of plastic surgery.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just go with it!,"I like Adam Sandler movies. I like Jennifer Aniston romantic comedies. Or any movies she is in. I like movies where people try to deceive others.So you know I'm going to like this one! I have just one complaint. I had to use my brain too much. It's too hard to keep up with all the lies.But you know what they say. When you lie once, you have to tell ten times as many lies to cover up the first one. Here, one little white lie--okay, a big white lie--turns into many lies as new details have to be explained. Add in scheming kids who blackmail their fake Dad who has money, and a couple of unexpected developments, and the formula is complete chaos.Adam Sandler is not a pathetic loser here. Well, he sort of is. Despite being on of the top plastic surgeons in Los Angeles, he can't get out of this jam he is in without spending a ton of money. And is it worth it? Well, Brooklyn Decker is gorgeous. And she looks great in a bikini. Plus she shows up in a towel and you hope it's going to come off. And it does. From the back. Even though it was FX, which allowed G.D. and the middle finger, nothing more was visible than one would see on broadcast TV. But it was a treat for a brief time. I only wish I had known who she was. I feel like I knew her when, as a local TV news reporter did a feature on this wholesome girl next door who happened to be a famous swimsuit model. As an actress, she is pleasant and a little on the bubblehead side, but as a teacher, the character has to be halfway intelligent.But is the grass always greener on the other side? Don't people sometimes already have what they want without realizing it? Jennifer Aniston is also really good-looking despite her age. And she always has that great hair, regardless of the style. She even looks good with glasses. And what a body! I didn't know what to expect when she started taking off her clothes. And if you liked that, there's a hula scene which is a bonus.But it's not just how she looks. She nearly always plays these intelligent characters who roll their eyes at what they have to put up with. She's the same type character here. Very appealing, and willing to do whatever it takes. And she might just be rewarded. Well, the expensive clothes and other perks are at least part of the reward.I should mention that one scene that keeps this from being just a formula movie takes place between Devlin and Devlin (Yes, I have to say that her nemesis from college shows up--just as she uses the woman's name for Danny's fake wife). That's really all I can say. It's an unexpected situation and proof these characters can be more than stereotypes.Oh, yes, about Devlin. Nicole Kidman does a wonderful job with a perpetually happy but often nasty character.I don't know anything about Nick Swardson, and I'm still not quite sure who he is, but he somehow ended up in this mess torturing poor Katherine as her fake Eastern European boyfriend Dolph. I thought he was supposed to be Russian, but I'm not quite sure. Very over-the-top, when in character.And what cute kids. Maggie is quite a schemer herself, and very proper English as ""Kiki Dee"". Or is that Audrey Hepburn in ""My Fair Lady""? Very funny, regardless. Michael also manages to get what he wants in exchange for portraying ""Bart"", though he didn't quite think it through. One of his fantasies was Hawaii, so naturally this dysfunctional group ends up there, with entirely new fake story lines to present to others.I've never been a fan of Dave Matthews, the singer or the actor. But the man who is both does a good job here as a pretentious inventor who expects the best of everything because, after all, he has money. And Devlin (the real one) just loves him.So, will everyone end up with who they should? All this scheming results in some important realizations. But the question is whether those will lead to what should take place.The result is a real winner.",,Anonymous,Romance

Her obvious good looks never hurt anything, and her comedic talent and timing is first-rate. Nicole Kidman, in a small part still looks like a Botox junkie. She was once so gorgeous.

Formulaic Rom Com with Over the Top Jokes,"Within 10 minutes of viewing, it became clear that 'Just Go With It' would be a formulaic, see the ending coming a mile away romantic comedy which is not my type of movie. It was obvious where the script and in turn, characters, were heading as everyone went through the motions to fulfill the nearly 2 hour movie time.I was open minded once the romantic comedy by numbers format became evident since the trailers/previews advertised what looked like a hysterical, fun film and figured if anything, I'd get a few good laughs out of the experience. However, in the end, the movie was more ridiculous than funny, the usual awkward boy/girl romantic scenes at the end in a rom com were hard to sit through and I found myself questioning the mental capacity of Brooklyn Decker's character, Palmer.Sandler plays a plastic surgeon named Danny who meets and likes a much younger woman (23) named Palmer (Decker) at a party and after spending a romantic night on the beach with her, she finds a wedding ring in his pocket. While not married, Danny carries one around as a way to attract women with sob stories of a an abusive/drunk/pill popping/tumultuous wife and horrible home life which seems to work. He had become bitter about love after having a bad experience 20 years earlier with his to be first wife who in the end, he didn't end up marrying. Rather than reveal his trick to Palmer, he tells her that he's married but getting divorced and Palmer decides that she needs to meet his wife to see for herself. Enter Katherine, played by Jennifer Aniston who is playing the same person she plays in basically every movie, who plays Sandler's homely assistant/office manager at his plastic surgery practice. She is a divorced single mother of two who, after some convincing, agrees to play his wife. Cue a makeover to create the illusion of a wealthy plastic surgeon's wife where Aniston suddenly goes from drab to fab (cliche much?) & the subsequent meeting between Danny/Katherine/Palmer. All is going well until Katherine gets a phone call regarding her children which Palmer overhears and now there is a whole fake family of Danny/Katherine + her 2 kids which they tell Palmer, of course are his children. Add in fake names for the kids and bribes to get them to play along and you have a comedy.. I guess.The majority of the movie takes place in Hawaii - a trip that is taken by Danny/Katherine/the 2 children/Palmer and Danny's cousin Eddie (Nick Swardson), who has a crush on Katherine and makes himself apart of the picture but telling Palmer that he's Katherine's new boyfriend - and of course Katherine has to play along even though she can't stand Eddie.The lies start out small and then spiral out of control with people clearly coming up with outlandish things on the fly, shocked reactions from the others and then a quick cover and build onto the fake story. It was OBVIOUS that these people were lying and just coming up with random things as they went along yet Palmer bought it all which, for me, just became too ridiculous to believe as the movie went on. It actually became frustrating watching her observe these clearly fake performances and outlandish accents (the daughter played by Bailee Madison and Danny's cousin, Eddie, both speak with over the top faux accents) and cover stories and seemingly buy it all for a good portion of the film. Palmer is supposed to be a smart, competent school teacher yet she was as gullible as a 5 year old and lacked the common sense of an 8 year old. Just too muchway too much and can I just say that the character of Eddie was so unfunny that it was uncomfortable to watch? I usually love Swardson in movies but the whole character was horrible.Overall, the movie had some funny moments but the lies became so extreme and so excessive that it became ridiculous and just plain stupid by the half way point. It was unrealistic that Palmer would buy the lies and the formulaic boy/girl rom com script only hurt the film. Nicole Kidman plays Devlin, a mean girl sorority sister of Katherine's from the past who Katherine in present day still greatly resents. Of course Devlin just so happens to also be vacationing in Hawaii and runs into Katherine who then, wanting to make a good impression concocts the lie that Danny, the plastic surgeon, is her husband which creates a new set of shenanigans.Lastly, the time line confused me. Palmer/Danny meet and hook up on the beach. She finds his wedding ring and wants to meet his soon to be divorced from wife. They meet and next thing I know they are on some big trip to Hawaii where Palmer is meeting Danny's fake kids and is now sort of apart of the family. Seems odd since they never even went on a date prior to the trip. It felt really rushed and weird.5/10 and it's a shame because this is one film I was really looking forward to based on the previews. The only 2 really funny moments that made my laugh hard were 1, when Rachel Dratch makes a cameo as a patient of Danny's on a consultation at his practice and 2, a hula show down between Katherine/Devlin (Aniston & Kidman) that escalates into hardcore competition for a win.",,Anonymous,Romance

One-time (somewhat funny) Watch,"I watched this movie for the lead actors. Suffice it to say, I was a little disappointed in the end because the movie wasn't as good as I expected it to be. It was slapstick comedy at best, with a lot of the jokes being too crude for my taste. The overall plot though was a comedy of errors and was reasonably funny, although at times, it went a little overboard. It also seemed like Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston were trying too hard. Having already proved their natural flair for comedy, and great comic timing, it seemed like the lead actors were putting in a lot of effort to come off as funny. That was a tad upsetting. I did like Sandler and Aniston's chemistry though. The supporting cast was also decent. The light nature of the movie and the humorous undertones were good enough to warrant a watch, but I probably wouldn't watch it again.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A competently crafted romantic comedy but not the best,"There is nothing to dislike about this film apart, perhaps, from the fact it does go on a bit too long and by the time you get to the point where it begins to wear thin you probably know the ending already. In fact if you follow romantic comedies closely you will have guessed the end not very long into the movie at all but it doesn't spoil the journey in the least.The back story opening is not especially well done although it serves the purpose of dishing up the reason why Dr Macabee (Sandler) wears a wedding ring. From there the plot clumsily lunges into the smoother tale as to why wearing a wedding ring when he is not married inevitably eventually leads to trouble. Sandler is his usual self, Anniston is as good as I have seen her in a movie, and Kidman has a minor riot with a wonderfully flawed character.If you like romantic comedies it will not disappoint you but there are better choices elsewhere.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Just Bored With It! At least more than half of the time.,"""Just Go With It"" is a very silly comedy about a plastic surgeon who wants to hook up with a voluptuous teacher so he asks his assistant to pretend to be his ex-wife and for her kids to be his kids. Why would anyone go through all that to hook up with a female? Two words: Brooklyn Decker! The ""she is out of everybody's league"" famed Sports Illustrated model plays the stunning teacher Palmer. Oh, and these two relatively unknowns Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston play the plastic surgeon Danny and his assistant Katherine, just go with it. I actually think that Director Dennis Dugan's masterpiece ""Just Go With It"" should be nominated for a plethora of Oscars for next year's ceremony, and be the first comedy to win a Best Picture Academy Award since ""Annie Hall"". Come on, I am having some fun, just go with it! Let me go back to the narrative of ""Just Go With It"". Because of plastic-lies surgeon Danny's continuous lies & fabrication, a lot of silly stuff transpires in the movie which leads the film's characters into Hawaii, even though there was not much Alo ha ha ha in those scenes. Now there were a few that I went with and made me chuckle, but not nearly enough. Sandler and Aniston looked like they were simply just ""going with it"" to collect a paycheck. News Flash: Decker is not the second coming of Michelle Pfeiffer but she is sure one that could cause many other second comings, we will just leave it at that. Nick Swardson's performance as Danny's cousin Eddie is deserving of the MOCAT Award, that would be playing the ""Most Obnoxious Character of All Time""; even though I have to admit that his sheep scene was not a piece of . (well, you know). Oh, and Tom Cruise's ex also shows up in this one also; and I am not talking about Mimi Rogers, Katie Holmes (eventually that will happen), or Ms. Scientology (look at last parentheses comment). I am not kidding, Kidman is in this movie, and is not a cameo either. ""Just Go With It"" was actually scribed by two screenwriters, Allan Loeb and Timothy Dowling. I guess it does take two to make a word thing go wrong. OK, it was not that bad, there were a few zingers here and there that made me laugh; but again not nearly enough! If you do not take it too seriously and take it for what it is, ""Just Go With It"" might just pass go with you. But if you are expecting an authentic witty comedy, then simply don't go with it. *** Average",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
much better than Adam Sandler's last attempt at comedy,"I thought this movie was OK. It had some laughs and I actually thought Jennifer Aniston was good in this. Plus, it has some beautiful shots of Hawaii. Brookly Decker doesn't need to quit her day job; not sure why they hired her as an actress. She looks way to young for Sandler. So Sandler plays, Danny, a plastic surgeon whom likes to lie about being married because he can get chicks easier. He has a hot assistant with two kids, Katherine, played by Anniston. Danny thinks he has found THE girl, Palmer, but still can't help the lies. The next thing he knows, he's pretending Katherine is his soon to be ex and he's the dad of her kids. The boy, Michael, wants to go to Hawaii to swim with dolphins and says this in front of Palmer. So now Danny can't say no and all of them plus his weird cousin, Eddie, are off to Hawaii. In Hawaii, Danny soon bonds with the kids and sees how much he depends on Katherine, so you know the ending.Nicole Kidman has a small part as Devlin, the girl Katherine can't stand and lies too and tries to outdo in a hula contest.FINAL VERDICT: This is a good pick for a fun movie and time waster.",,Anonymous,Romance

a better version of a Bollywood movie,"This is a really funny movie. Even-though the story line is not new to me. It is basically taken from a Bollywood block blaster ""Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya"" (2005). Starring Bollywood superstar Salman khan , Katrina Kaif and former Miss World Susmita Sen. The Bollywood version was funnier but this is more acceptable or realistic. In a script where little chance of acting provided, Jenifer Anistone shone brightly. Nicole Kidman cameo brought a fresh air. Otherwise supporting roles were not up to the mark. Adam Sandler is as lively as ever. Loved it. Overall a good time spent.

"Fun to watch, Some very funny moments and a heartwarming story","I watched this with my girlfriend, and I wasn't expecting much. This film genre, though I usually enjoy the comedy side, tends to be rather heavily focused on the romance.Adam Sandler's character was well played, and very funny, going to extraordinary lengths to cover up a lie he'd made to the gorgeous Brooklyn Decker (who would have made the film worth watching even if the story was rubbish). Jennifer Aniston's character was also nicely portrayed.I thought the soundtrack was a bit off in places - the music could have done with being a bit older, but generally the film was put together incredibly well.For me, though, as a guy who tends to prefer action flicks, it was the comedy that made this film good. Sandler and Aniston were on good form, but it was the involvement of the kids that made this film so funny. Oh, and the scene with the fake German accent and the sheep.

Not Going With This!,"Adding to Jennifer Aniston's growing portfolio of Rom-Coms comes Just Go With It, but despite a huge budget, this embarrassing flop ends up going nowhere.The premise is a good one: a plastic surgeon (Adam Sandler) is in romantic pursuit of a much younger girlfriend (Brooklyn Decker), and trying to smooth over a lie that keeps on building with the help of his assistant at the clinic (Jennifer Aniston). Yet despite the star cast and exotic locations, the actors' delivery is a confused mishmash of slapstick comedy and nerdish quick-fire dialogue.There are some funny moments, particularly in the first part of the film, but it soon lodges itself firmly in 'uncomfortable viewing' territory. The dialogue – particularly between Aniston and Sandler - is at times rambling and littered with awkward silences. Adding to this bewildering experience are some technical curiosities: the film editing leaves a lot to be desired - woeful cutting and continuity blunders that would leave first year film students aghast. The external sound frequently suffers from ambient distractions, whilst indoor scenes are often clattery or muffled - not of a standard you'd expect of a Hollywood movie. The lighting, too, is brash and littered with inconsistencies - unflattering on the actors.Aniston outclasses the entire cast in terms of looks, presence and delivery - surely uncomfortable appearing in a production of a standard well beneath her abilities. At 117 minutes, it's a marathon of the worst cinematic kind, becoming more cringe-worthy as it labours to a conclusion.A shakedown of the script and technical issues could have made this an acceptable comedy, but its fate is sealed early on. Like so many Rom- Coms, it plunges into a quagmire of misfiring gags and flawed plot lines from which it never emerges.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

Woman for rent...,"""Just Go with It"" is a comedy movie which has to do with a man who ask from his loyal assistant to pose as his soon to be divorced wife because he wants to cover his care about his old love of his life. In this movie we watch him start with only one lie but after that for everything he wants is telling a lie, so he had to deal with this two women but with his lies too.I liked this movie because of the plot and the storyline, the direction of Dennis Dugan was really nice too. I have to tell you that the interpretation of Adam Sandler who plays as Danny Maccabee was not the best of him but Jennifer Aniston's interpretation who plays as Katherine Murphywas the assistant of Danny was really good such Brooklyn Decker's who plays as Palmer the love of the life of Danny and Nicole Kidman who plays as Devlin Adams.Finally I have to tell you that ""Just Go with It"" is a simple comedy movie which shows the true love of a man and what has to do a man to get the love of his life.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The movie was disappointing,"Frankly it's not a surprise that Brooklyn Decker was so heavily promoted in the marketing of this movie. She is one of the few bright moments. Not just because of the eye candy factor. There is no doubt that she is a stunningly hot woman but in this movie she is also a really nice and sweet character and frankly the scenes with her were one of the few things that made the movie more tolerable. Yes even when she had clothes on which is impressiveAs for the rest the best word to describe it is cliché. Adam Sandler plays the same good guy who lost his way , does the same jokes to deal with bla blah reaches realization due to unforeseen consequences. Basically every Adam Sandler movie everThe children are incredibly annoying . I think they were aiming for children with adorable quirks that are supposed to be annoying but are actually endearing but to me they were just annoying As for Jennifer Aniston...I honestly don't know what's wrong with this woman. I can understand Adam Sandler repeating his formula. Those are his movies and for better of worse(for worse) they are a proved cash cow and he is a businessman after all. But Aniston? The woman is rich as hell and has enough influence to get a variety of roles and she plays the same character for close to twenty years now. And yes she plays it in this movie as well. And yes it's as boring and unoriginal as you thinkSo in conclusion if you are a hardcore Sandler and Aniston fan you might like the movie. If you haven't watched too many Sandler Aniston movies you might still like it. But if you already sick of seeing the same movie over and over but with a different name and the same characters over and over I suggest you avoid it. Or at least don't pay money for it. It's not worth it",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Adam Sandle is a despicable man and plays himself in every roll,"It's very clear Adam Sandler had a sad youth with lots of disappointments and bullying but do he really have to bully back? In every roll he plays he picks on kids and he loves a setup joke where the banana peal is on the ground and he just sits and waits for someone to trip and hit his head and bleed all over and then he jumps out and laughs. That's the perfect setup for Sandler.Humour of a 2 year old. Adam Sandler loves slapstick to the degree he even spoils a joke for a redneck. Without Adam Sandler this movie would have been a good 7 but with him, the very best you can ever score it is a meek 3, he really draws everything he touch in the dirt.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Kinda funny, actually.","I'm running out of stuff to watch so I decided to put this on expecting to hate it considering I usually hate Adam Sandler movies, and Jennifer Aniston seems to play the role of Rachel from friends in just about everything else she stars in. So how surprised was I to hear myself laughing out loud not once but several times? I mean I wasn't rolling on the floor or anything but I definitely let a giggle or two escape. First of all it was a relief to realize that after Sandler started speaking that it was in his normal voice, without his signature fake speech impediment. That made the whole movie much more tolerable than most other things he has been in. But it was the daughter that did it for me. When she busted out her English accent I about died. That little British crumpet made the whole movie for me and she deserves an Emmy.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
This isn't Sandler's best film but is a nice addition to the comedy genre,"Just Go with It (2011) is a movie I recently watched on HBO at the recommendation of my wife.

The surgeon asks his assistant to help him play out the fake marriage scenario and she accidentally gets her kids involved in the storyline complicating matters and testing how far they can push the lie...This movie is directed by Dennis Dugan (Jack and Jill) and stars Adam Sandler (Mr. Deeds), Jennifer Aniston (Friends), Brooklyn Decker (Battleship), Nicole Kidman (Eyes Wide Shut), Nick Swardson (Grandma's Boy), Kevin Nealon (The Wedding Singer) and Jackie Sandler (Pixels).This film is way better than you may expect. The dialogue throughout the movie is pretty clever and has some great lines. Some of the scenarios are better than others but the first 60% of the movie is hilarious and well done. The chemistry between Sandler and Anniston is perfect and there are some hilarious scenes. I will say the final third of the movie is predictable and seems like it is trying too hard to create a coherent storyline, but that doesn't detract from enjoying the characters who are well established and hilarious.Overall this isn't Sandler's best film but is a nice addition to the comedy genre.

"While the final outcome was a little predictable, the path to get there was unique and special.","Adam Sandler films are so unpredictable. In the same year, he can make an absolute dud like Jack and Jill and a genuinely good film like Just Go With It.From start to finish, this film has a high level of charm, mostly due to the chemistry between Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston. While the final outcome was a little predictable, the path to get there was unique and special. From the hula/coconut contest to the beautiful ""What I Love About You"" scene, this film was full of moments of realness. There were still scenes with Sandler's typical over-the-top crudeness, but they were less than some of his other films. When he moved away from being obnoxious and focused more on being authentic, there were sparks of magic.I laughed out loud and felt genuine emotion from most of the characters.

What you see is what you get, no surprises, I can admit its a damn sight better than complete trash such as Little Nicky, Zohan, Mr, Deeds, Eight Crazy Nights and Jack & Jill combined, but still not really recommended for more than background noise as you do something else and certainly nowhere near as good as the wedding singer, happy gillmore or billy Madison.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
The title says it.,"Okay, I can't help but ask, what were people expecting? It's a comedy that stars Adam Sandler. Is it a classic (like 'Cactus Flower')? Of course not and why would anyone think otherwise? But, it is one of Sandler's better comedies, certainly, at least for me, way more enjoyable than the lacklustre 'Funny People', 'Bedtime Stories', 'Click', 'Mr. Deeds' etc.There is the expected load of toilet and trashy humour which is mostly done by Nick Swardson (the worst part of this movie). Surprisingly, Sandler is less over the top than he usually is and he actually fits the part. Jennifer Aniston shines with a sincere performance in a non-challenging role. I felt hat her character wasn't properly fleshed out and she wasn't believable as a single mother of two kids mostly because of poor character and story development.One of the many major flaws of 'Just Go With It' is the writing (which isn't very uncommon among Adam Sandler comedies). The romance between Katherine and Danny felt rushed as did the entire ending. Brooklyn Decker looks hot and isn't a bad actress for a hot newcomer even though, in terms of hotness, she has tough competition in the form of Jennifer Aniston who doesn't shy away from showing her amazing curves. Nick Swardson is irritating to the core and this movie would have been a whole lot better if his sequences were entirely cut out.The best and funniest part of 'Just Go With It' are the sequences with Nicole Kidman and Jennifer Aniston competing with one another. Though her screen time is limited, Kidman shows that she is great with comedy. The hula competition is particularly a treat to watch.The title pretty much sums it up. Don't expect too much. Just go with it and try to enjoy it at the moment, for what it is.",,Anonymous,Romance

Just a great laugh...,"...and nothing else, like very few COMEDIES these days can provide you with. I don't know why is this movie taken as a romantic comedy and, for me, this is a genre (if it can be defined as a genre) that is very easy to distinct. For example, take a romantic story, add a few comedy elements without adding any big tragic event and you get yourself a romantic comedy.On the other hand, and this is still just my opinion, when you add some romantic elements in a comedy (if you didn't know, romances are a part of our day-to-day life), it doesn't automatically makes the movie a romantic comedy. In a similar way, by adding other elements we would have a horror comedy, a thriller comedy, etc. This movie keeps it simple. Yes, it does have some romantic elements, but it doesn't rely on them to be funny. JA (although not my favorite actress) was very good and has proved, once more, she has a good eye for movie parts. AS was as usual, funny and not pretending to be something that he is not.The bottom line is that you should not over-analyze this movie, or expect a great romantic story between main characters, but just prepare yourself for a great laugh.P.S. You should also check the official website (http://www.justgowithit-movie.com/), and the advertisement ""Tell your girlfriend it's a ROMANTIC COMEDY"". I take it as to fool your girlfriend that it's a romantic comedy so she'd come to see it, and she won't get disappointed.P.S.S. I just made my review 'cause I really liked the movie, while half of reviews were negative, and all the stuff they are complaining about are related to their false expectations.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Illogical, predictable and another step downward in the once great comedic career of Adam Sandler.","'JUST GO WITH IT': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Another generic Adam Sandler vehicle, this one teaming Sandler with Jennifer Aniston and re-teaming him with director Dennis Dugan (who also directed 'HAPPY GILMORE', 'BIG DADDY', 'I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU CHUCK & LARRY', 'YOU DON'T MESS WITH THE ZOHAN' and 'GROWN UPS'). It's written by Allan Loeb and Timothy Dowling and based on a 1969 film called 'CACTUS FLOWER' which was based on a Broadway stage play and a French play. It tells the story of a womanizing plastic surgeon (Sandler) who convinces his loyal assistant (Aniston) to pretend to be his wife for the weekend in order to deceive a young woman (Brooklyn Decker) he's trying to win over. The story is illogical, predictable and another step downward in the once great comedic career of Adam Sandler.Sandler plays Danny Maccabbee, a once 'funny looking' goof who turned to plastic surgery (in order to fix his own problems with attracting ladies) twenty years earlier when his fiancée broke his heart on their wedding day. He also learned the clever art of deception and tricking women into thinking he's unhappily married (by wearing a wedding ring) in order to attract sympathy sex. After meeting a women half his age, named Palmer, and falling for her he talks his assistant, Katherine Murphy, into playing the part of his abusive wife who he says he's divorcing. Then when Palmer discovers Katherine has kids Danny idiotically tells her their his and has to carry on the charade for an entire Hawaiian trip vacation (with Katherine's family).Adam Sandler and Jennifer Anniston are both talented and funny actors but they do an extremely poor job of picking roles. Here they're both funny in places and have some chemistry but the script is too poorly written for either to do too much of anything impressive with. Anniston has always been known for doing work far beneath her talents but Sandler used to make funny movies, once upon a time. Now everything he does is so formulaic and forced (a lot like TV sitcoms) and lacking of any originality or witty humor whatsoever. They do always do well at the box office though and it's good in today's economy to see the rich keep getting richer. The film's one saving grace is a nice supporting turn from Nicole Kidman though who surprisingly makes the movie a little more watchable. All in all it's about what anyone should expect from an Adam Sandler stock comedy.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j95Zjdlcbe0",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Adam Sandler has done so many of these, that he has stopped acting in them. He just goes around with a pronounced silly look in his face. Jenifer Aniston never WAS funny, so she just becomes a more tired looking version of herself. To watch this, and to listen to the dreadful script could take a couple of points off your I.Q.

Would totally recommend it!,"The movie ""Just go with it"" is a great choice to unwind and break the routine. Before watching any movie, I am used to going through the review and even though almost the half of them were negative or mixed, I decided to watch it anyway because of the cast, eventually my friends and I left satisfied having a great time.First of all, even though some could say that the plot and storyline are quite predictable, it still worth watching at least because of the characters' development and well-written and build story. I would say that exactly this simple and dull story with Adam Sandler's lies changes the whole direction and sometimes makes viewers surprise and wait for the following scene.Secondly, amazing choice of the main characters. Mostly, I think that the movie is so well-known due to them and their acting skills. Moreover, I would say that Junnifer Aniston is genuinely a perfect choice for that role. Adam Sandler's acting become more natural in comparison with his previous works such as ""50 First Dates""; this movie showed him as a more compassionate human but still there were some of his stupid and sometimes hilarious jokes that sometimes make viewers to laugh out loud. The two kids are also worth mentioning, they perfectly managed their roles and brought a lot to the movie for sure.However, there were some things that cannot be unnoticed, the first things that comes to mind in the first ten minutes of watching is how it could be written so unrealistic, even though it relates to the comedy category, it included a list of thousands impossible things such as woman with a jumping eyebrow or self-centered and irresponsible upbringing way that cannot be tolerated. Obviously, almost everything including acting were exaggerated, but sometimes it can even viewer questioning ""Is that really possible to a human behave like that?"" or ""Why I am watching this?""
Besides, the jokes that were also mentioned before sometimes crossed the line. Although the age restriction is allowing to watch the film by reaching 13 years old, honestly, I would not recommend this movie to watch to my younger sibling and anyone before reaching at least 16 years old; not because of nudity or smoking, but due to their language, jokes, behavior and unnecessary sexual references.Anyway, I would suggest this movie for a friends' movie night, because it's a well-acted, written and filmed movie that will totally make you laugh and forget about everything for another two hours.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

The characters in the film like think up their own movie on the spot, being creative in the process and there's the good happy ending. To surprise the viewer, it Does come unexpectedly! All actors do their part very well. The credit goes to Adam Sandler, who fits in his role like the hand fits in a glove.

Also like his older movies, there were those few moments that were so sweet that made you wish you had your own ""egg-head."" Jennifer Aniston was awesome in this movie. She's a funny girl, but has been given bad material in the past. This was just what she needed. She was sexy, funny, and totally knew her roll. Plus, she had such great chemistry with Sandler. I can never buy the chemistry in her other movies between her and other guys, but these two seemed to really hit it off! Over-all great, funny movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pretending all the way to Hawaii,"Just go with it is a remake of the far superior 1969 film, Cactus Flower which won Goldie Hawn a Best supporting actress Oscar.Adam Sandler plays Danny a renowned plastic surgeon who improved his own looks and pretends to be in an unhappy marriage to sleep with hot women. He wears a wedding band to carry out the deception.When he hooks up with an attractive younger woman Palmer (Brooklyn Decker) who does not fall for the scam as he does not wear a wedding ring. When she later sees him with a wedding band, Danny has to convince his assistant (Jennifer Aniston) to pretend to be his soon to be divorced wife and her two kids to be their own kids and they go off to holiday in Hawaii where Danny plans to propose to Palmer.While in Hawaii Aniston meets up with an old college rival played by Nicole Kidman where they have petty feuds.It all leads up to Danny discovering the Aniston is actually very attractive, has a sexy body and they have a romantic spark with each other.The film has the usual Sandler hallmarks. He is rich, successful, women fall for him, he has goofy acquaintances. The new thing being that Sandler makes sure he can mix work and pleasure by filming in a popular holiday destination such as Hawaii in this case.As always there is the normal Sandler quota of 1980s music, here there are some effective mash ups with some recent songs.The film did not start off well but gets to be more fun and enjoyable as it carries on. To be fair Aniston and Sandler make it better than what it deserves to be but apart from a few minor laughs it is another long line of underwhelming rom-coms. Not funny or romantic enough.As a remake it is disappointing. The 1969 film balanced Walter Matthau falling for a cute Goldie Hawn and his assistant was played by Ingrid Bergman. The balance is brought out Bergman being middle aged and also the greater age disparity between Hawn and Matthau.Here it is all beautiful people from Hollywood. Aniston, Kidman, Decker all look great in a bikini. Sandler does not have that rough and ready look of Matthau and the remake has no soul.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Held captive on Non stop flight by this movie,"It had to happen...the pairing of my least favorite actress with the untalented Adam Sandler, whose career has mystified me even since I first saw him on SNL. Here they are, hemming and hawing their way thru an unscripted string of under-rehearsed comedy sketches whose unifying link is their crass lack of originality and pointlessness. This movie generated 0.0 of the warmth a romantic comedy should. I despised ALL of the characters from the opening moments until the credits rolled. I guess United Airlines wanted to show a movie that would equally offend and not entertain everyone on the flight. I like smutty jokes and sexual humor if it's funny but this was a big nothing. If anyone wonders why our schools are out of control and falling apart, you could look to a film like this to understand how we suffer if this is what is pawned off as entertainment.............

Just Going with It,"What ""Just Go with It"" lacks in witty and clever dialog, it certainly makes up for with enthusiasm. The actors make the film work. I'm a big Jennifer Aniston fan, and when I saw the previews for this movie I thought, oh no, she's doing another rom com that's going to go to the dogs. However, Aniston and Adam Sandler work very well off each other and their natural chemistry gives an entirely far fetched plot a natural feel. And let's face it, it's a romantic comedy. People don't go see rom coms to be blown away by the incredible script and mind blowing plot; they go to laugh and feel good for a few hours. It was funny and I found myself laughing more often than I thought I was going to. Brooklyn Decker, Dave Matthews, and Bailee Madison all gave solid performances, but it was Nicole Kidman who really stole the show. Her rivalry with Aniston as her ex-sorority sister was the most believable part of the movie ergo the most enjoyable (the hula dance off was absolutely priceless). The thing that the film easily could have and should have excluded was Nick Swardson's character Eddie. His annoying accent and inappropriate jokes were completely unnecessary and quite frankly made it a whole lot more unpleasant. All in all, I enjoyed it and thought it was a great way to kill two hours.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Typical dumb sandler plot lines. And what's with the Sting/police soundtrack?

Not at all as bad as the critics say,"I was lucky not to listen to the mostly negative reviews on rottentomatoes otherwise I would have missed a truly funny and also charming movie with something in it for everybody, even children. The reason why this is not the typical dumb ass comedy is because it is an original screwball comedy and to call it predictable is nonsense since the predictability is the essence of the genre. We do not want to know if but how. Therefore we need real characters with a life and not just situation based punch lines. This little* film provides both of it. The dialogues were mostly believable, they sometimes sounded even a little improvised between Sandler and Aniston. All in all a good entertainment with nothing to be ashamed of and even worth watching more than once.*In fact, it is not as little as it should be. It is an awful tendency to blow up movies to two hours (why do they do this?). Often, the story does not deliver enough for that length so they come up with lot of side stuff that sometimes has nothing to do with the plot at all and has the quality of filler material.

The premise, while not very innovative, did have some potential for a fun rom com with a twist. Unfortunately, it just so happened to be an Adam Sandler movie, and not one of those rare good ones either. The fact that it starts with a joke poking fun at Jewish people having giant schnozzles should already give you and idea about what kind of a movie this is going to be: dumb, witless, uncomfortable to watch, painfully unfunny, and full of so-called ""jokes"" poking fun at other people through the lens of ugly stereotypes. You know, like a typical bad Adam Sandler movie.I had to stop at a scene where Jennifer Aniston arrives at a meeting with Sandler and his girlfriend, pretending to be his soon-to-be-divorced wife. This scene was so god-awful and full of painfully unfunny improv that I just couldn't take it anymore.I recommend that you stay away from this one.

Sandler's Best In Years,"An awful lot of Adam Sandler films are stupid, unfunny, poorly written and forgettable, but every now and then comes a film featuring Sandler that works, and Just Go With It is that film. It's similar to my favourite comedy Easy A in the way that's there an overwhelming sense of fun and joy, but Just Go With It adds in a silly nature but it's a tolerable and fitting silly nature, whisking along it's quirky characters into nutty situations. In this romantic comedy, Sandler is Danny, an unlucky in love plastic surgeon who finds ""the one"", but after a lie backfires, he must recruit his loyal assistant Katherine (Anniston) to play his ex-wife in order to win his love's heart, all this catastrophic lying ends Danny, Katherine and her kids in Hawaii, where the lengths we go for love is shown. Whilst the performances are nothing groundbreaking like the ones in Crazy, Stupid, Love, the cast here are clearly having fun, and Adam Sandler doesn't phone it in, he's actually great. Dennis Dugan isn't a great director but this time around he proves he can do good, and it shows through the characters connecting and playing off on one another.

"It's not Old Sandler, but it's good enough","This movie was much better than I thought it would be. I agree with all the negative things people say about it, but that doesn't change my opinion that this movie is genius. The only downside to the movie is that throughout the first time watching it I was constantly thinking ""this blonde chick can't be this stupid..."", but all the hilarity that happens made up for it. I never cared for Jennifer Aniston, but i see her in a different light now after watching this. never found her sexy either. now I do. The Blonde chick (don't know her name) wasn't really a character. just the person all the hilarity revolves around. Sandler, of course, is always on his game. He's selfish and at times cruel, but under all of it he shows his big ole' heart. His interaction with the children who play in the movie is perfect. The children by the way are great. The little girl was too funny. i don't want to spoil anything, but the girl is into acting and improv in the movie, which I think makes this movie genius because YOU KNOW there is some improv going on, and not just with Sandler, but with a lot of the actors playing alongside him, including Jennifer Aniston. Nick Swardson is quirky and adds some strange humor to the table, but all in all works out. Don't want to spoil anything else, but there are two guest appearances toward third part of the film that turn things up a notch. Just think of a coconut clenched between your butt cheeks.... 8/10 for this charming movie that me and my cousin can't stop watching. It's going right on my shelf alongside with Little Nicky, Big Daddy, Happy Gilmore, and many others. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go make a ""devlin"".",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

One of Sandler's better family films.,"Just Go With It is actually a really good movie with plenty of laughs. Adam Sandler has struggled as he's transitioned to more family oriented films to keep his edgy and outlandish style but this is proof that he's still got it. Jennifer Aniston has one of her best roles ever where she isn't completely intolerable. While both of the stars are outstanding, the biggest laughs come from Nick Swardson. He is so ridiculous and out there that he can pull off the craziest of roles. Also, unlike most comedy movies, this film isn't full of annoying moments that never seem to end.

I also recommend watching it more than once. Kind of like 50 first dates it gets better the more you watch it.

Just Go With It,"Just Go With It is a film about a fake married man, Daniel Maccabee, who makes his way through life by going to a bar every Friday night to pick up younger girls. In order to get these girls, he pretends to be married to a wife who doesn't appreciate him, beats him, and cheats on him. Danny (Adam Sandler) is a plastic surgeon in Southern California who thinks he has met the love of his life, Palmer (Brooklyn Decker). In order to be with her, he needs to prove to her that he is indeed getting a divorce with his 'wife', Katherine (Jennifer Aniston), and that his life with her is indeed over. The movie follows a normal chick-flick theme but allows for twists and turns throughout, allowing you to guess what will happen until the end of the film. Director, Dennis Dugan, portrayed a well put together, overly dramatized dating fairy tale. While this is an Adam Sandler production, it is much more family orientated than films such as, That's my Boy, Billy Madison, and Happy Gilmore. Of course the film kept some of the 'Adam Sandler comedy' such as when a little boy runs into his 'junk' and yells, ""He put his pee-pee on my face!"" Danny yells back, ""He put his face on my pee-pee!"" While the actors fit their characters perfectly, a few parts were greatly dramatized. Jennifer Aniston was her normal cheery self in the film, while Adam Sandler tried to take on a more fatherly approach rather than being a bachelor. The music throughout the video was very fitting with the setting. The music selections such as ""Chasing Cars"" by Snow Patrol and ""Every Breath You Take"" by The Police were properly played during moments which could persuade your predictions of the movie to go the other way. The 'follow your heart' scenes, as I like to call them, where the character is forced to make a life altering decision, is where the vast majority of these songs appeared in the movie. The plot was very sound. There was no part in the movie where the audience could get confused as to what was happening. The film was very easy to follow, but if you were to stop watching the film, you would be highly likely to miss something funny or important. The plot was organized, well planned, and full of laughs, and the directing was well done for this romantic comedy. The lighting, script, and musical input made this a well done film. The lighting and comedy were always there in the right place and time. If you are looking for a romantic comedy, that will get you laughing, this is the film to see. Adam Sandler keeps this film clean with limited amounts of swearing and nudity (bikinis and underwear, of course!). The PG-13 criteria fits the rating well. The plot was solid, acting was sometimes over dramatic, but never cheesy, and the effects were wonderful. The movie seemed almost realistic, except the scenario was a little over the top.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Boring and too long,"Honestly speaking I expected much more than what this movie actually delivered for the simple reason of the wonderful cast. Adam Sandler, Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman in one movie? And how can it be this bad I ponder. It's not the worst romantic comedy ever but all you can gain is some simple laughs after a long 117 minutes. It's like it just sucked 2 hours of my life time for nothing.Danny is a past middle aged plastic surgeon who just met a 23 year old girl. For some reasons (which 'cannot 'be explained in a short review) he ends up convincing to her that he is about to get divorced. And he gets his assistant Katherine to pose as her soon to be X wife and her children as his children. The stunt goes uber crazy when everyone decides to go to Hawaii for a vacation. And Danny and Katherine start to realize their emotional side in the middle of all this.What are good about 'Just go with it' are the little funny moments. Some jokes are quite rude to be frank but can give you a good laugh. The two kids do a pretty fantastic job than the adults somewhat.And there is plenty to talk about what's bad about this flick. The plot itself is a failure. It's vague and doesn't really build any heat as it should be. And the phase of the movie is quite boring. It drags in some scenes unnecessarily and where it should slow it quickly cuts to the next scene. And as I mentioned before it's too long. Then the acting is bad. It's nothing like Sandler and nothing like Jennifer.

Rated this awful not because of the acting or he storytelling but just for the above mentioned fact. The movie is quite good.

Just Go With It - 1 Star,"""Just Go with It"" is another step down for Adam Sandler's career. It starts inside the lethargic world of Sandler and ends within the tired formula of the romantic-comedy genre. It's a long, slow slide from crudeness to mediocrity. The morons that are the film's characters are appalling upon the moment of their introduction. Unfunny and mentally incompetent, these people roam around the movie's dead plot until it's time for them to learn their life lesson while somehow finding a way to remain stupid.Most of the film's first half is devoted to Adam Sandler's compulsion to fool around. Most of the people are around him should be either a hateful jerk or a dumb stereotype, so his character would blend in with the crowd. He plays a rich plastic surgeon, Danny Maccabee. Danny's heart was broken many years ago. As a coping mechanism, he pretends to be a depressed loser in front of pretty women. His life is so miserable that the women have no choice but to sleep with him just to cheer him up.One night, he meets a cute blonde named Palmer. His pre-planned lies result in their physical intimacy. He wakes up in the morning convinced that Palmer and himself are destined to be together forever. Danny is apparently delusional enough to base his conviction on a one night stand. Coincidentally, Palmer is dumb enough to agree with Danny.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/just-go-with-it-movie- review/",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

Just Go With It (2011),"Very lazy rom-com farce with Sandler doing a very slightly grown-up take on his unfunny, charmless man-child character, here realising his assistant is the love of his life, not the 23 year old hottie he's about to marry. Out of the cast, only Aniston impresses with decent comic timing, with many others simply making fools of themselves or proving that their talents should stay on swimsuit calenders rather than the movie screen. Dave Matthews turns up for an unknown reason, as does Kidman (slumming it but apparently having fun) and some Police songs are bastardised into remixes, although despite the painful mugging there are a couple of more subtle visual jokes that suggest the filmmakers do actually have some knowledge of cinema history, including a La Dolce Vita waterfall shot.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A predictable and stale ""comedy""","I used to like Adam Sandler's movies. Billy Madison, The Wedding Singer, even 50 First Dates. They were funny, and though they weren't in the least sense intellectually stimulating, they were at least entertaining. I can't say any of these things about Just Go With It. This is one of my least favorite movies of 2011, and that's no exaggeration.This is a ""brainless comedy,"" only without the comedy. The jokes are stale and have been done countless times in other, better movies. The plot is disjointed and unbelievable. The reason the audience suspends their disbelief is so they can be rewarded with comedy, or in the very least some form of entertainment, but when that isn't provided, all we are left with is a very pathetic Adam Sandler trying to impress some random woman so he can (I guess?) marry her. The characters are as dumb as can be, and none of the main actors Adam Sandler, Jennifer Aniston, or Brooklyn Decker share chemistry. It seems like none of the characters can think five minutes into the future, which has the potential to be funny if the audience wasn't expected to feel sympathetic towards Adam Sandler's character.

"Tries to be two things, fails but not too bad","Sandler and company go back to the well that gave us all '50 First Dates', a quirky and funny Rom-Com. While '50' had some over the top moments, without them the film was still a good and solid romantic comedy.Now think of 'Joe Dirt'. A funny comedy that does not pretend to be a romantic comedy.Unfortunately, 'Just Go With It' tries to be both...and fails. Not terribly, but it goes off the rails halfway through and maybe recovers a bit, but not fully. I was just disappointed at this film, at times it felt like they just went with the first draft of the screenplay. Annoying characters which are supposed to be hilarious I suppose...but made me actually think of leaving. It got that bad at one point...",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Predictable but still enjoyable,"You can pretty much predict how the plot of the movie will unfold you watch it. Regardless, it's still an enjoyable movie given the chemistry that Anniston and Sandler have. Secondary characters like Decker and Madison give decent performances as well. The movie did however have three or four scenes that had my crying of laughter.
All in all this movie is predictable, but funny and enjoyable nonetheless.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

They all just showed up. The only one that seemed happy about doing this movie was Brooklyn Decker. One last question, where did they find those kids? The little girl is still playing Annie and the kid is supposed to be a dud, he qualifies. They must be related to someone financing the movie. Please send them back to school.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

I know it's a lightweight movie for family-watching. But it has something special. Sometimes we, men, look for those beautiful, perfect looking girls and think that SHE IS THE ONE... don't be fools! Learn how to feel the real magic when you are with a woman. Learn the lesson from this movie!

Shameless smug hollywood materialism on display,"Almost turned this off after a character buys $1,700 shoes. But then in another scene is eating at pizza hut.

Stores like Barney's, Luis vitton and other stores for the super rich are celebrated here as well as other snobby rich settings. Scenes with guys in suits and dress shirts aimlessly wandering around the set and sitting around doing nothing make this movie a pathetic joke. The director expects you to pay for it and enjoy it as if to say Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston are in it so just don't pay attention to how bad this movie is and how there is nothing going on in this movie that is interesting.

Just Run from It,"Nothing fills you with dread more when there is a new Adam Sandler comedy released and the 2011 release of ""Just Go With It"" emphasises this point.In this offering, a plastic surgeon Danny, whose wife has been cheating on him. He decides however to keep the ring as he realises that this is the best way to engage in relationships with women. As the film moves forward, we meet Palmer (Brooklyn Decker) who Danny decides he wants to marry but (gasps) the drama, she finds the ring and she immediately tries to cut him off. Clearly, the only way to fix the situation is to convince his co-worker Katherine (Jennifer Aniston) and her two children to pretend that they are family in order to prove that he is in fact divorced so he can then marry his dearly beloved.Firstly, if you think that the above plot synopsis makes absolutely no sense then that's because the story makes absolutely no sense. For reasons which cannot be explained, they end up in Hawaii because they had the financial backing to do so. There are characters on screen which should not be in the film or have any purpose in the film ( i refer to the German one who is only pretending to be German, again reasons unclear) who are either immediately annoying or just horrible.The Script is just woeful. It is an alleged comedy but I didn't laugh once throughout the whole film. It's not just that the jokes aren't funny, I think if you are a sentient living breathing human being, some of them are not acceptable in this day and age. For instance, Sandler makes a joke quite early about what he would do if one of the kids was disabled which I thought was incredibly distasteful and just not funny. There is absolutely no comedy in the film and although it tries to use it as a way to get into the characters, the viewing audience is unable to as the script does not allow them to be funny, charming or likeable in any way.But, the film's most staggering flaw has to be the performances. To get a sense of how bad the performances are Jennifer Aniston manages to play everyone off screen. Jennifer Aniston, a woman who I am yet to see in a good film, outplays Nicole Kidman. Now, what on earth is Nicole Kidman doing in this Film? Firstly, she offers nothing to the story and worse than that, when you meet her character, she is immediately annoying beyond belief. Just seems to me that he was phoning it in, picking up the cheque and I sincerely hope she takes the money she made from this film and uses it to purge her soul for being a part of it. Adam Sandler's character is horrible rather than charming and then you have the issue with the accents. One character as I previously said is acting German but is not funny, more infuriating and I wonder how this plays in Germany as it just may cause a lot of offence there due to the lazy stereotype of ""this is what all Germans sound like."" Further, Maggie, what i'm assuming is child number 1 in the film, speaks with a weird British accent although this one sounds like Sherlock Holmes has just done a load of Helium balloons. Again, reasons why she does this aren't really pointed out in the film. I'd rather not go hard on her too much because it's not her fault and she's clearly been told to do it, but it just makes her infuriating and eventually makes your toes curl as she repeatedly carries the act on.I do believe that it is Adam Sandler's intention to see just how bad of a film he can make. The jokes aren't funny (and to some people potentially offensive) and the performances are staggeringly terrible, but on the plus side Hawaii does look like a nice holiday destination for the whole family as Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston clearly looked like they had a great time - which is more than we did.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
I think this will do much better on the video store shelves!,"I finally sat down and watched this last night as i am presently enjoying a lovely case of the flu. Once again a Happy Madison Pictures film that showcases all of Sandler's buddies in real life. I swear this guy thinks to himself and says 'You know what? I haven't seen my pals in awhile lets shoot a flick!' Although fellow buddy and SNL alumni Rob Scheneider must've missed the reunion memo. This time around Sandler portrays Danny a plastic surgeon who after having a rough childhood and earlier life of ridicule due to inheriting the family 'overly large nose' trait decides to make money of his own misfortune and become one of L.A's top plastic surgeons. Danny along with his assistant/ bff Katharine (Aniston) head to Hawaii with her two children in tow posing as his ex-wife in order to cover up a lie he has made to his much younger and very beautiful girlfriend Palmer (played by Brooklyn Decker) This parlays into the fish tale becoming increasingly bigger and bigger as the movie moves on with some hilarious scenes as a result of it. OK my own personal thoughts on this latest Sandler fare...hmmm? Well put it this way i have seen way better and still stand by my Sandler got missed at the Oscars announcement after seeing "" Love Reign Over Me"" however this is a cutesy romantic comedy that I'm sure will do better as a DVD rental then it did in it's initial theatrical release as couples journeying into the local video store are always looking for these types of films to cuddle up with on a Saturday or Sunday night.

Some Great Sight Gags and Lots of Flat Scenes,"I watched this on Netflix today, and then read the reviews here. Most were either very lauding, or extremely awful. For me it was in between, not awful, but not good either.I have to date seen 10 Adam Sandler movies. I can't say I'm a fan, but I am not a Sandler hater either. For me, ""Just Go With It"" is not as good as ""Big Daddy"", ""The Wedding Singer"", ""50 First Dates"", ""Click"" or ""Anger Management"". It is better than ""Happy Madison"", ""Billy Gilmore"", ""The Waterboy"", ""8 Crazy Nights"", and ""Spanglish"". I still haven't seen ""Punch Drunk Love"", but while critics loved it, most people I know who saw it were disappointed.The good points of ""Just Go With It"", were some extremely funny sight gags mostly early in the film, and lovely ladies to look at. The plot had potential, but it got bogged down with sequences that were poorly paced and didn't really connect as comedy. The two kids were quite original and good actors, adding some needed humor and a bit of pathos. The bad points were some poor acting, and, as stated before, scenes that went on too long trying to get laughs that didn't materialize, but most of all the length of the film. At nearly two hours, the movie could have used about 20 minutes removed, since the plot was fairly predictable early on. It definitely could have used tightening.Overall, not a stinker as some have said, but not among Sandler's best efforts. I rate it right in the middle, a 5, an opportunity not fully realized.

Adam Sandler worst actor in the history of motion pictures,"Adam Sandler has no vocal inflection and no facial expressions. He is not remotely handsome yet over the years he has made movies with some of the most beautiful women in Hollywood.

In her ""love"" scenes with Adam she plays as usual Rachel and Adam plays David Swimmer.

Don't Go With It,"I was already familiar with the plot of the movie as I have seen one version of it earlier. So nothing was new for me in terms of plot. Still I was expecting this movie to pull through because of Adam Sandler. Sadly this was not the case.First of all the premise itself is not good. Adam Sandler is a bachelor carries a fake wedding ring and pretends to be in a dying marriage to get laid. However when he meets Brooklyn Decker, he wants to get serious with her. She discovers his fake ring and instead of telling the truth he convinces his receptionist Jennifer Aniston to play his fake wife.Now here is the thing, what happens when Brooklyn Decker decides to visit him in his office. Wouldn't she notice the wife working in the office ? It is not as if the filmmakers don't know the issue, Jennifer Aniston's character even comments about it in the movie. But no reasonable explanation is given. Then we get fake kids. I am just curious how long would that arrangement have gone on. Would Sandler get visitation rights ?Well it is comedy and you are supposed to forget about the plot, but regrettably this film has no laughs.

"Owner of good jokes and with a low script that from the beginning, ""Just Go with It"" allows you to glimpse each movement of the characters until the inevitable conclusion","The screenplay by Allan Loeb and Timothy Dowling fits into the same framework as virtually every Adam Sandler film. The difference is basically in the profession of the actor's character, who has been a veterinarian, architect, singer and player of all possible sports. Here, Sandler plays Danny Maccabee, a successful plastic surgeon who wears a wedding ring to pretend he's married and get attention from women. Just as he falls in love, his new girlfriend demands to meet Danny's wife and reassure her that they are in fact splitting up and that things will be fine between them. With no way out, the surgeon turns to his secretary Katherine, played by Jennifer Aniston, to be his pretend wife. Even reluctantly, she accepts and even places her two children as part of the fake marriage. To show that he is a present father, Danny grants his youngest son's request and takes them all to Hawaii for a few days on vacation, setting up the perfect scenario for everything to go wrong.This sudden forced vacation, by the way, exposes the fragility of the script, revealing itself to be a mere artifice to throw all the main characters into a context in which any situation, however disconnected it may be, is accepted without further questioning (as was the case, for example, in ""Grown Ups""). Constantly having to invent new lies to support the farce, which becomes more and more absurd, the characters seem not to mind using the ""artistic freedoms"" of the situation to pin themselves, not realizing that this makes the process even more exhausting, in addition to running great risks of compromising the objective. As if that weren't enough, at a certain point a second farce is created - which, at least, results in a good moment when, by the pool, Nick Swardson's character finds a practical and simple solution (ok: silly, but fun) so that the truth is not revealed.A network of meaningless lies that would be easily explained serves as a point of attack for a succession of bizarre situations. But, in a way, there is some fun in ""Just Go with It"", mainly due to Sandler and Aniston's talent and chemistry. She, mainly, engages us with an easy but intelligent style of comedy with good lines, especially when she starts a personal dispute with Nicole Kidman's character, her former college classmate. Playing Danny's silly cousin, Nick Swardson manages to star in the biggest nonsense of the projection. An interesting thing about the film is this clash of generations, often conducted subtly. References to the 1980s, when the protagonists were young, contrasting with the 1990s-2000s generate good jokes like the one related to the band NSYNC, while the soundtrack brings new versions of songs by classic bands like The Police. At one point, Jennifer Aniston's character explains to Brooklyn Decker that no post-95 rhythm pleases Adam Sandler's character. There are age crises, beautiful body disputes and even a surreal Ula-Ula competition.However, the merits of the film do not go far beyond that. First, Sandler's character falls in love and does everything to be with Professor Palmer, played by Brooklyn Decker, but what the film least shows are the two of them together. If you stop to reflect in the middle of the film, all the effort he is making makes no sense, because until that moment the two lovers had not spent more than one night together. It simply cannot be bought. At this point, the script reaps the results of not having invested more in the introduction of the two characters and the relationship between them. Another problem is the repetition of jokes. The secondary characters are mostly irritating and insufferable. Children even yield an initial sympathy, after all they are children, but after the third time the eldest daughter repeats that British accent you are already rolling your eyes. Nick Swardson's character goes without saying, he manages to be in embarrassing bad taste. His ""original"" version shown in the first few minutes wasn't that great anymore, but when he has to spend half of the film pretending to be a German sheep farmer the notion is completely gone. Nicole Kidman, on the other hand, manages to get some laughs with her egocentric and competitive character, but the truth is that her screen time is at the limit to save her participation before she becomes overly cartoonish.Without presenting characteristics that differentiate Danny from many of his previous characters, Adam Sandler makes his composition with frightening precariousness, alternating lines uttered with disdain and misplaced imitations - and the professional success of the surgeon, for example, becomes inexplicable when we realize the lack of professionalism he displays in his consultations. Meanwhile, Jennifer Aniston, who in recent years seems to have specialized in films of the genre, offers an uneven performance, managing to save herself only in the few opportunities she has to interpret a real person (in general, more in the first act of the film), while Nick Swardson also has his chances to make fun of Eddie's forced eccentricity, but there's no ignoring the fact that his presence in Hawaii is absurd and unnecessary.And if Brooklyn Decker doesn't have much to do with Palmer, the same can't be said about the young Bailee Madison and Griffin Gluck, who display great talent as Katherine's children and even steal a few scenes. But the highlight is the participation of Nicole Kidman who, totally comfortable in the role, has fun with the self-centered and snobbish Devlin, Katherine's former colleague - and what most calls attention is the simple strangeness generated by her unexpected appearance. In such an unusual project in his career (the most attentive ones will notice a reference to Moulin Rouge during the hula competition).If all the slips in the script denounce the weakness, or at least the mediocrity, of the project, the look of the screenwriters in seeing references is as profound as the maturity of Palmer, assiduous reader of Seventeen magazine and lover of NSYNC, which for a pedagogue, it is almost the homicide of the education of our young people. Thus, the jokes related to ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Saw"", or mentions of ""Californication"" and ""Hannah Montana"", reveal all the childishness of the project and explain why, after just a brief conversation on the beach and a night of sex, Danny falling head over heels in love with childlike Palmer. However, do not forget the names of the protagonists, the supposed message conveyed by the script and the genre to which the production belongs before imagining the cliché ending of the narrative.Commanded by Dennis Dugan, whose greatest quality is letting Adam Sandler do what he wants, the narrative never finds justification for extending for almost 120 minutes. Afraid to go on further, the director inserts a loose epilogue that intends to close the loose ends left by the profusion of characters and leaves the viewer with the thankless task of imagining the solution to all conflicts. The filmmaker's inspiration and creativity are such that he allows himself not just one, but three scenes in slow motion in which the characters walk without compromise towards the screen. At no point does the film manage to escape certain conventions of the genre - and so, don't be surprised to see a scene involving changing clothes while shopping or one that, at the climax, shows the characters awake in the middle of the night thinking about their lives. In addition, Dugan contributes to the irregularity of the production by using inclined planes twice without a reason for doing so or by adopting an unnecessary voice-over narration at the beginning and end of the projection. Without understanding that humor does not need to be accompanied by exaggeration, the film rarely succeeds when it combines the two aspects, as in the scene in which Eddie tries to resuscitate a sheep, which he amuses by not trying to hide that the animal is clearly a doll - and ignoring the unforgivable way the character got to that situation. Constantly challenging the viewer's intelligence (like the moment when Katherine and Devlin talk alone and later, we discover that Danny was there, listening to everything - when he wasn't), ""Just Go with It"" tends to be fun for those who have expectations and mediocre for those who shiver at the mention of the name Adam Sandler.Cliché from the beginning, ""Just Go with It"" proves that a dozen laughs don't make a great film, but fortunately prevents this production from being included in the list of other atrocities highlighted by Happy Madison, Adam Sandler's production company. What gets in the way here is the lack of pace to tell a predictable story, sometimes tiring the viewer with the overexposure of uninspired sequences. Even so, filmmaker Dennis Dugan knows where to find humor in his cast and makes a film that is, at the very least, fun and without the pretense of going down in history. If it's a disposable film, at least it works as a passing entertainment. Owner of good jokes and with a low script that from the beginning allows you to glimpse each movement of the characters until the inevitable conclusion, it only serves to maintain the status quo of the stars involved, who came out of this with another box office success, without much effort.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just not funny enough,"Just Go with It is less juvenile than many of Adam Sandler's previous works. So that's good. But in a movie which unbelievably stretches to almost two hours in length there are very few laughs. That's bad. Sandler, for the most part, acts like an actual grown-up. But this more mature Sandler doesn't turn out to be a funnier one. This is a hit-and-miss comedy in which the misses definitely outnumber the hits.Sandler plays Danny, a successful, and quite single, Los Angeles plastic surgeon who scores with hot women by using a wedding ring to pretend he's unhappily married. He is quite content with his life of meaningless one-night stands. Then, without his fake ring on, he hooks up with the impossibly hot Palmer. He feels a genuine connection with her. But then she finds the ring, assumes he really is married, and refuses to have anything to do with him. Danny tells her he is about to be divorced, Palmer insists on meeting his supposed wife. Danny concocts a plan, having his office assistant, single mom Katherine, pretend to be his wife. But the plan veers off the rails and Danny ends up having to take the ruse all the way to Hawaii. Danny, Palmer, Katherine and Katherine's kids, who Palmer thinks are also Danny's kids, jet off on their tropical adventure. There's also a very annoying fake boyfriend for Katherine. So much deception. But so few laughs. The setup is seemingly there for some decent screwball comedy. But the movie largely falls flat.The movie is not a total failure. There are some chuckles here and there but no huge laughs. Certainly not enough consistent comedy to maintain the film over its exorbitantly long running time. Sandler is OK. The real standout is Jennifer Aniston, playing Katherine. Aniston has such great comic instincts and is so incredibly charming. It's a shame she doesn't have better material to work with here. Brooklyn Decker is surprisingly good as Palmer. A swimsuit model by trade Decker certainly fills out a bikini quite well. And in this film the camera lingers over her to the extent drooling may be induced from some members of the audience. But Decker proves to be capable of more than looking hot, she actually shows reasonably decent acting chops. She could have a future in this. Heck, she turns in a much better performance here than Nicole Kidman does. Kidman shows up halfway through the film and you'll wish she hadn't. She mails in a terrible performance and her character brings a bad vibe to the proceedings. She's a villain in a film which didn't need one. Nick Swardson, playing Katherine's fake boyfriend with a fake German accent, is grating to the extreme. And just when you think he can't be any worse he has an excruciatingly unfunny encounter with a sheep. The less said about that the better. The children are rather annoying as well. It's hard to produce a likable comedy when there are so many characters you don't like. Sandler, Aniston and Decker do the best they can but everyone and everything else fails. The comedy never hits it big. The plot fizzles out rather quickly and there's more than a hint of obviousness to it. It's not hard to guess where the story is headed. That wouldn't be so bad if there were a lot of great laughs along the way. But those laughs are not there.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Unfunny garbage,"I only watched this to see Kidman, and considering it's Adam Sandler, I wasn't expecting much. But wow, was this was horrible and much more painful than I had initially expected. I got an hour in until I just skimmed through and only watched the scenes that Kidman was in. Up to that point, it proved to be a completely predictable, unfunny, clichéd, and cringe-inducing movie that nearly gave me a migraine. This entire film's paper-thin premise is built around people being stupid and situations that could have easily been avoided. Sandler has absolutely no charisma, and is criminally unfunny, which tears the movie apart. I actually ended up liking and respected the antagonist in this (Kidman) more than the protagonist (Aniston). This is the result of the terrible characters and even worse portrayals. How am I supposed to believe that Sandler is a medical doctor when his vocabulary is as developed as a five-year-old?The only saving graces in this was Bailee Madison who is quite a good child actor, and Nicole Kidman who I was really embarrassed for. She deserves better than this.",,Anonymous,Romance
"disgusting scheme, unreasonable lie, can't quite recover from bad start","Danny (Adam Sandler) has come up with a scheme to get rid of every girl he hooks up with by pretending to be married. Only the scheme backfires when his dream girl Palmer (Brooklyn Decker) mistakenly falls for the lie. In order to salvage his relationship, he recruits his assistant Katherine (Jennifer Aniston) to pretend to be his wife, and soon to be his ex.This is a remake of Cactus Flower (1969). Adam Sandler comes off more of a douche than the original. The original was already douchy but that was another era. His womanizing scheme is disgusting which makes Danny a douche. The reason for the scheme is to avoid these single women who are all desperate to get married. Times have changed. The original lie to Palmer is unreasonable and really distracting. The whole thing starts off horribly. Brooklyn Decker is surprisingly good for a model turn actress. Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler have some good vicious dialog exchanges together. They could be in a fun standard rom-com together. But the movie never recovers from its bad start.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Why you should and shouldn't see Just Go with It,"Katherine (Aniston) is plastic surgeon Danny's longtime assistant, who agrees to help Danny to deceive Palmer, and of course it gets complicated. When the web of lies expands to include Katherine's children, her daughter Maggie (Madison), who wants to be an actress, sees it all as a fun exercise in improv. This adds another, entertaining level to the premise: what if the Whose Line Is It Anyway comedians had to fool an audience member into thinking the sketch was real? Members of Just Go With It's makeshift acting troop slip up or make ill-considered choices, and the others are forced to accept the challenge and ""just go with it"" in order to keep their increasingly intricate collaborative work of fiction from contradicting itself. I didn't laugh out loud, but I suspect I was as amused as most people are when they disingenuously type ""lol"" online.Sandler's affinity for children (he has two) shows in his scenes with his two young cast mates, and Aniston is charming, as she's been in every role in which I've seen her. The romantic side of this romantic comedy keeps to the usual template, for the most part, but I knew that going in, and the same old thing is done well.Why you should see it: You like sweet fluff, when it's done fairly well.Why you shouldn't see it: You fear cinematically-induced diabetes.

In the lie they found the truth.,"Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston star in ""Just Go With It."" A movie where Danny (Adam Sandler) must engage Katherine (Jennifer Aniston), his faithful assistant, to pretend to be his soon to be ex-wife. Danny must pretend that he is married, because he lied to his dream girl, Palmer (Brooklyn Decker) the most gorgeous woman in the world. To keep the woman he loves, covering up one lie soon turns into many lies.First off, I love the cast! Sandler,Aniston,Decker,Kidman and Swardson are the dream team comedy cast. The script was filled with humor that they carried out so well. There are scenes where you will laugh so hard that you may get trouble breathing or laugh till you cry.Secondly, while the plot is predictable, watching them as the movie progresses is definitely fun! The movie also gets interesting when Devlin(Nicole Kidman) is introduced. I also must say Nick Swardson was extremely funny! Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler had good chemistry and after all the lies that they told, they eventually discover the truth.I laughed so much for this movie and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Just watch Cactus Flower instead,"Trust me when I say you don't want to waste 2 hours on this movie. The film that it's based off of, Cactus Flower, is a better film in every aspect. I watched it 20 years ago and it's still one that I would rewatch. I hope to never watch Just Go With It again.Walter Matthau plays a better slimy bachelor pretending to be married than Adam Sandler ever could (Matthau practically invented the trope). Also, the plot is more believable in Cactus Flower. The only thing that both films are similar in is the female lead. Both Aniston and Ingrid Bergman are wonderful to watch. Comparing Brooklyn Decker (Palmer) to Goldie Hawn is not a fair comparison because Goldie is a genius actress.Again, if you want to not even crack a smile for 2 hours while you watch Adam Sandler doing his usual thing, then this movie for you. Otherwise, just watch Cactus Flower; you'll have a lot more fun.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just Go With It or Just Go Without It?,"Just Go With It, or just go without it – it really doesn't matter. The romantic comedy, Just Go With It starring Adam Sandler, Jennifer Aniston, and Brooklyn Decker was a truly average movie.The movie was extremely predictable and it had about as many bland jokes as it did funny. Jennifer Aniston did a typically mediocre job acting and Brooklyn Decker's big-screen debut proved to be nothing special. Surprisingly enough, Adam Sandler did a fairly good job – although he was extremely convincing in a few of the more serious and emotional scenes, he tended to return to his typical man-boy humor routine in an effort to get some cheap laughs. The plot of the movie has undoubtedly overdone – a guy with an attractive long time female friend whose good looks are hidden by a myriad of easy to fix factors meets a stunning woman and attempts to woo her, only to realize his feelings for his friend. To make matters worse, the movie is presented in an unrealistic fashion – Adam Sandler appears as an unattractive compulsive liar who easily wins the hearts of two stunning and seemingly flawless women.Despite these glaring flaws in the movie, Just Go With It did not go without some redeeming qualities. It had a couple of scenes that were laugh-out-loud funny, and a number of other scenes that were quite amusing. Furthermore, the movie's serious moments actually had substance – which was, considering the cast, entirely unexpected. Sandler easily made the transition from humorous to serious and skillfully portrayed a sensitive man who was great with children and was desperate for love. The movie also managed to keep the clichéd plot somewhat fresh with several surprising plot twists and amusingly unrelated scenes.All things considered, I would recommend renting Just Go With It on a night when you don't feel like watching anything heavy. It is an average movie worth watching for a few laughs, but it doesn't offer much more.",,Anonymous,Romance

Typical Adam Sandler But Worse,"Can't believe I even started watching this on NF. I thought Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman (why I watched it at all) looked better than ever, weirdly, but now realize that the movie is 10yrs old! Thanks for using my subscription money wisely, NF, with the latest of releases!This film is offensive to everyone but straight, white middle aged men. Really degrading to women and that's only the start. Nothing is off base for Sandler, even his own heritage. But Sandler has never had enough imagination to be creative in the least when sending up cultures, and there IS a way to do that without being offensive, yet actually being funny, which this is not.The acting (if you could call it that) is really uneven, and sometimes Sandler suddenly realizes he is in a movie. The surprise performance is from Nick Swardson, esp the sheep bit, at around 50:00 (yes, takes that long to get to any humor). Even Aniston is less than her usual self, although she outdoes Brooklyn Decker in a bikini (because Aniston has a personality, talent, substance, AND is gorgeous).If you like films where *every* man onscreen is a total creep and liar who uses and objectifies women without any filter at all, then this film is for you. If you like films about middle aged men chasing girls half their age (hey, the Seventeen mag prop was not my idea...and of course Brooklyn is older, but really cringeworthy). If you like films which make jokes at the expense of minorities of all sorts, this is for you. If you never tire of poop (tons and tons of them, 9yr old boys will love this), d*ck, and bathroom jokes, this film is for you. If the latter is preferable to actual humor, then this is for you. I'm ashamed I watched as long as I did, but I was doing something else, in my defense.Why do The Police songs sound like covers? Like someone ran them through a weird effect or remixed them. Badly. The music is generally awful and just a cash grab, usually have little to do with what's going on. Love using Roxanne for Aniston's sexy song, but then again, she really did prostitute herself for this POS.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

The older maturer Sandler needs to just go....,"There was a time when Adam Sandler made some pretty funny movies. He has starred in such hits as Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore and 50 First Dates. Sadly, those movies were all made early in his film career. As Sandler has gotten older, his movies have gotten a lot less funny. Just Go with It is his most recent movie to fail in being funny. In Just Go with It, directed by frequent Sandler collaborator Dennis Dugan, Sandler stars as Danny Maccabee, a plastic surgeon, bachelor and lover of women. Jennifer Aniston is Katherine, Danny's surgical assistant and single mother of two. Aniston looks fantastic, and provides a few minor spots in which she makes you laugh, but regrettably how she looks is what she'll be most remembered for. Brooklyn Decker, the buxom Sports Illustrated swimsuit model, makes her acting debut as Palmer. Lacking the humor of Aniston, Decker is merely there for the purpose of looking incredible, and often is seen in a very skimpy bikini. Nick Swardson, playing Danny's Cousin Eddie is laughable at times, but more often than not leans more towards corny. The stars of the film, without a doubt, are Bailee Madison and Griffin Gluck who play Maggie and Michael, Katherine's children. The youngsters are pleasantly funny, without feeling forced, and have most of the funniest lines and are in most of the funniest scenes. Supporting appearances are made by Nicole Kidman and Dave Matthews; both are equally forgettable. A lot of potential, but none of which was reached.Filmed mostly on the Hawaiian island of Maui, Just Go with It has a gorgeous backdrop. The resort the film takes place at, and the women in the movie are beautiful. However as a whole, the movie is highly predictable. Sandler no longer has the appeal he once had while making pictures that we more juvenile. Sandler has become just another male actor trying his hands at romantic comedies. The problem is that most male actors are fairly attractive making the premise somewhat believable, whereas Sandler just doesn't fit the description. He's not someone that women are anticipating seeing without his shirt on, ala Matthew McConaughey. Sandler is an entertaining individual, and I believe that he can still be funny and juvenile. However, every person comes to a point in their life that when they decide it's time to grow up and it's beginning to feel like Sandler has come to that point. If that's the case, then these types of movies are going to become the norm and not the exception.Grade: Cvisit our site at www.twodudereview.com",,Anonymous,Romance

"Worth a look, but don't expect much","I have noticed a common trend with Adam Sandler in his latest string of family flicks. Gone are the fart joke comedies in favour of the more serious but still silly family orientated roles.The whole script gives me a headache just thinking about it. A Plastic surgeon creates a web of deceit, involving his assistant, her children and friend to impress a young woman who he thinks is the one. The whole concept is ridiculous and Sandler finds himself digging out hole after hole to cover all his lies.It is the same brand of humour and old faithful guest appearances that Sandler is known for. I failed to see any original jokes or comedy that has not been done in his movies before. I did get a giggle at a subtle jibe at Heidi Montag, who had a guest appearance as a partygoer, in a room full of people who had become disfigured from overdoing it on cosmetic surgery.Then the movie gets corny and Sandler delivers his traditional happy ending where everyone involved comes out smiling.The movie is OK; there is something familiar and oddly comforting about Sandler movies for me, so I always endeavour to see them.

The 2000's are not for Adam Sandler,"Oh, the infamous fall of Adam Sandler! In the early 90's, he played in some of the funniest movies I've ever seen: Waterboy, Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and Big Daddy. His latest movies: You Don't Mess With The Zohan, Bedtime Stories, and Just Go With It, have been terrible.This movie had a decent story plot and had lots of opportunities to make it hilarious. But they failed. Bad casting (I hated those kid actors: Not Cute, annoying, and were unlikeable brats, and what happened to Rob Schneider being in all of Adam's movies?) Nick Swarsdon was the funniest man in the movie, unlike Jennifer Aniston and Adam. I cringed in my seat when I saw the guy from the Dave Matthews Band playing the husband of Debland.Now let's focus on the comedy. I hardly laughed at all during this movie, and especially not at any of Adam's jokes. The slapstick and predictable humor was all in here, when he was hit in the private area. The only exception was Nick Swarsdon. Truly funny guy, and I think he did a great job. The only I part of the movie where I chuckled was when he picked the ball up with his butt. That's it.Adam, here is my advice. You can make more of these horrible movies, go to SNL again, or become a writer / director. Your acting career is on the downhill slide. Try to find the originality of your first movies. This movie, Just Go With It, has a alternate title: Don't Go To It.",,Anonymous,Romance

A typical American rom-com...,"(+) Pros:* Beautiful photography and sceneries. Hawaii is literally a dreamscape.* The plot was quiet catchy, that made me watch this film.* Quiet funny at times.* Glad that the ending wasn't that eventful like always (in American films).(-) Cons:* I don't know if Adam Sandler is untalented or it's just his style of acting. I have to watch more of his filmography, so I can see if this is keep happening.* Didn't surprised me at all. Nothing special or prototypical.~ ConclusionIn general, we're talking about an American romantic comedy film. I've finally learnt how it works, so that's why I found nothing special in this. There was a lot of americanism in it. Quiet funny, because this is actually an American film, but by saying that, I mean that I knew how the plot would flow.It also kind of reminded me of ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" film. I don't consider it bad, since there is no parthenogenesis. Besides, it's a remake of an Indian film (that I'm willing to watch) and it is based on a book.Altogether, it's an American rom-com, not bad, but not something really special.Fun to watch, especially on summer.Recommended if you want to watch something light and with positive vibes.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Stupid Premise,  But Still Funny","Adam Sandler's movies are almost always charming, sweet, and funny and Just Go With It is no different. If you like Sandler, you'll like this movie. My only problem is that the characters are unbelievably unrealistic. The central problem, having to get the hot chick to deal with the fact that Sandler picks up women by faking a marriage, could've been solved with one line: ""Oh, the ring? I'm a rich plastic surgeon, and women are always coming on to me. I'm always afraid they're just after my money, so by pretending to be married, they stay away. But since I really want to get to know you, I took off the ring."" Problem solved.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
What The Kentucky Fried Frick Did I Just Watch?,"I'm a pretty big Adam Sandler fan, but this movie was worse than ""Little Nicky."" At about one minute in, the movie's only purpose seemed to be giving Sandler the opportunity to speak- up close and personal- to an incredibly hot, beautiful woman, using his VERY not-funny, self-deprecating pick-up lines which were poorly disguised as a plastic surgeon using professional language to describe breast-enhancement surgery, for example. I felt second-hand cringe the whole way through.It is here that I should probably confess that ""the whole way through"" this movie was only the first 15 minutes. I'm sorry, guys- I tried to stick it out. But the entire premise, combined with the a-First-Grader-could-have-written-funnier-and-less-embarrassing-dialogue only served to make me shake my head in bewilderment, and then turn it off.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Endless Overused Comedy Tropes,"If this was the only comedy movie of its kind then it would be fine and perhaps even clever. However, there's nothing included in it that feels like original material. In general I don't mind Adam Sandler's work and some of it I really enjoy, but this was one of a couple that just became irritating to me. Despite this, I thought Jennifer Aniston performed her role exceptionally well and kept the movie afloat.All of the scenes with Danny's ( Adam Sandler) friend Eddie (Nick Swardson) impersonating a German just wore on my nerves more and more. There's not much worse in comedy when the joke isn't hitting for you and they keep bombarding you with it over and over.At the end of the day though, this movie was never meant to be spectacular, so if you do decide to watch , then perhaps the title is very instructing; just go with it.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just average,"This is around the time when Sandler begins to go down hill a little and over works his movies. This movie had a decent story line and some funny moments but in large it was just riddled with random scenes, lines and jokes. Overall just a decent movie and nothing special.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Sandler's next film...is pretty basic.,"Honestly, i had expected everything that was coming from this movie. The premise, the resolution, most of the jokes...and i was happy about knowing it...Now, let me tell you this, real quick; Comedy is like one of my least favorite genres. why? well, when you see a good comedy, it's fantastic. when you see a bad movie, you can laugh at how bad it is. But with a bad comedy...NOTHING is funny about it. And i'll admit, this one made me laugh a lot, and was actually entertaining, for how well it was executed. The jokes was alright, there are some things that aren't really expected from this, and the acting, especially with the children, were good. I don't think i've seen kids act that well in a film with Adam Sandler, since Big Daddy, which was my first AND favorite Adam Sandler movie. But, other than that, it's nothing special. I wouldn't actually recommend this, but if you want to see it, then go for it.",,Anonymous,Romance
