The title alone will have you humming the song,"I don't like musicals. They never made any sense to me. Don't get me wrong, I love music; it's an important part of my life. I love movies also, and while the two often compliment each other, sometimes I'm repelled. It's probably the dancing. A person breaking into a complicated dance number, seemingly unaware of their surroundings, or worse yet, in complete synch with a complete stranger is like making fun of the movie, as if to say, ""Please don't take us seriously, we like to sing and dance."" Or even more ridiculous, ""Let's not fight, let's settle this dispute with a song and dance."" Forget about suspension of disbelief.This film however, I manage to enjoy. I once was given the task of my film teacher to watch the film and keep track of all the cuts in the film. Well, sometime after ten minutes I lost track because I was so wrapped up in the story. It really is an interesting period in the history of cinema, told well, and with well placed song and dance numbers that at times drag on, but that seems to be more of an excuse to show off the technicolour than anything else. They build you up to it slowly. The first few numbers don't break out at an inappropriate time. It doesn't last though, but by then they've got you.With such memorable tunes as these, it's hard to imagine them going wrong. When Gene Kelly sings the title piece, somehow time stands still as you're swept up in one of the most memorable scenes in film history. Just reading the title in print has likely caused you to hum a few bars, or sing a few words. Or maybe, just maybe, walk out without an umbrella when you know it's raining. One thing's for sure, if all Gene Kelly did was choreograph the dance numbers, he more than deserves the co-directing credit he has.They simply don't make films like this anymore. Which in some ways is a testament to the film's theme and narrative. The business of show is constantly in a state of evolution. The narrative portrays a time period when silent films were being replaced by ""talkies"" with sound, yet the musical genre itself has almost all but disappeared with the exception of animated films with musical numbers, and rare live-action pieces.One might speculate that Hollywood overdid the musical. Personally, I can't get into them. Most of the time it seems like a drawn out affair, but this film is something special. Considering my feelings about musicals, it would have to take a film of this one's caliber to make me sit up and take notice.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Classic,"Last year I was very lucky to catch this on the big screen. This film is meant to be seen on the big screen! It was also the first time I saw it at the theaters and I was very impressed with the visuals.In this film movies are switching over from being silent to being ""talkies"". However the film is a spoof of the turmoil that afflicted the movie industry in the late 1920s when movies when the change over went from silent to sound. When two silent movie stars', Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont, latest movie is made into a musical a chorus girl is brought in to dub Lina's speaking and singing. Don is on top of the world until Lina finds out.This is such a great film that if you ever get the chance to see this at the movies then DO IT.Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds made an awesome team.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Timeles Magic,"Can you imagine? Me, a film lover since the age of six, hadn't seen ""Singing In The Rain"" until last night. I had read and heard so much about it over the years that I knew I was going to be disappointed. As a musical I've never seen anything so perfectly ""in tune"" I can see how many directors have been influenced by the soul of this gorgeous movie. I've seen even Federico Fellini here. The tap routine with Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor is so energizing that I wanted to see it again and again. The fantasy number with Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse is breathtaking, breathtaking! How extraordinary to see Debiee Reynolds going through the contagious (Good morning!Good morning!) I had seen her a few nights before as Grace's mother in ""Will and Grace"" She hasn't lost her zest. I'm sure I'll be seeing this movie many times and I intend to show it to very young people from the post MTV generation and I'm betting with myself that they're going to love it.

Now that's entertainment!,"Singin In the Rain is arguably the best movie musical of all time, not just because of the music but because of the entire package - the premise, the comedy, the characters - everything here works together to make you feel better any time you sit down to watch it. It's ironic that this movie was thrown together quickly to capitalize on the success of ""An American in Paris"", since the improvisational feeling of the movie is one of the things that makes it so much fun. Although this film is number ten on the top 100 films of all time as compiled by the American Film Institute, it wasn't nominated for best picture the year of its release, 1952. Although it did well at the box office, it would be over twenty years before people would look back and realize just what a great motion picture it was. Perhaps that was because the 1970's were such bleak and cynical years, with movies that largely matched that mood, that people were eager to rediscover the fun that a motion picture viewing experience could be.The movie focuses on that period of time in which the entire motion picture film industry was in nervous transition from silent to talking pictures. Although the movie compresses time in this respect - the transition actually took about three years - it does accurately describe the technical problems of that era along with their comical aspects. There was an overabundance of musicals in the first batch of talking films, many stars did have heavy accents that made their speech undecipherable or voices that came across like nails on a chalkboard like Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) and saw their careers ruined, and early sound technology itself was so fragile that you would often see actors speaking to potted plants or to coat racks with comic effect. The preview of silent picture team Lockwood and Lamont's first talkie, ""The Dueling Cavalier"", is one of the most hilarious scenes in the film. It is pretty typical of what you would see in such an early talking picture - dialogue going in and out of sync, actors and actresses strutting around and wildly gesturing as if nobody can hear them, and dialogue that still resembled what you would read off of the title cards in a silent film - ""I love you, I love you, I love you"".All of this is one of the reasons Singin' In The Rain will never get dated - it is a comic nostalgic look at a very narrow period in time. This movie is fun outside of its comic take on movie history, though. For one, it's hard to say who steals the show the most, since there are so many thieves involved. Most notably there is Jean Hagen - who actually has a very pleasant speaking voice - as the evil silent star who can't accept her days are numbered. Then there is a 27 year-old Donald O'Connor as Cosmo, the studio music director and sidekick of Gene Kelly's character whose youthful exuberance really shines in the number ""Make 'Em Laugh"" along with all of his goofy facial expressions. He seems to be having as much fun as the audience. Finally, there are all of the great dance numbers and music, capped by probably one of the most famous scenes of all time - Gene Kelly's rendition of the title number that perfectly captures the joy of a man who has just fallen in love and feels he has the world at his feet. You just can't watch this film and not come away with a smile on your face. It is as good for the soul as chicken soup, just a lot more fun.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A fabulous musical romance about film technology,"Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are a famed Hollywood duo, making films at the tail end of the silent era. The studio has been issuing PR suggesting that they're a romantic item. In reality, they can barely stand one another. One night, while on the town with his best friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O' Connor), Lockwood has to run to escape fans who want a piece of him badly enough that they'll literally rip his clothes to shreds. He hops over a number of moving vehicles and ends up in the passenger seat of Kathy Selden's (Debbie Reynolds) car. Lockwood seems immediately taken with her, but she gives him the cold shoulder. She says she's an actress with a love of theater, and she looks down on film acting. Later, Lockwood discovers that she was inflating the truth a bit, as he sees Selden performing as a cute song & dance girl at an industry party he's attending. She runs out of the party and Lockwood chases after her, but he's too late. While he tries to track her down, he, Lamont and their studio have to deal with the changing nature of film in 1927--made much more difficult by the fact that Lamont may look glamorous, but she talks more like Fran Drescher in ""The Nanny"" (1993).Aside from the more serious aspects of the plot, Singing in the Rain is a great success as a romance and a musical. It also has an astoundingly rich Technicolor look, and it is charmingly humorous. Kelly and Reynolds click on screen, even if offscreen Kelly, who also co-directed and co-choreographed, was famously difficult to work with--he drove Reynolds so hard (she was a much more inexperienced dancer) that her feet literally started bleeding at one point. The songs are great, they're worked into the story well--which is perhaps surprising given that most of them weren't written specifically for this film--and the choreography is impeccable, frequently jaw dropping and always aesthetically wondrous and sublime. If for nothing else, the film is worth a look for its often-athletic dance numbers, which can resemble Jackie Chan's showy martial arts stunts as much as dancing. It's also imperative viewing for cultural literacy in the realm of film.But the more serious aspects of the plot are fascinating as well. In a significant way, Singing in the Rain is about film technology. Film technology is the hinge of the plot, after all. The climax and dénouement are decided by the advent of synchronized sound in the film industry. We see studio head R.F. Simpson (Millard Mitchell) demonstrating sound films at the party where Lockwood sees Selden for the second time, providing two big turning points at once. There are sequences of actors heading off to diction coaches, as happened in reality once sound entered the scene, and also in reality as in the film some actor's careers were jeopardized by having to suddenly master a new skill.But Singing in the Rain is about technology on another level, too. Kelly and co-director Stanley Donen go to great lengths to ensure that the film is an exemplar of state-of-the-art film technology in 1952. For example, the beautiful Technicolor cinematography is emphasized by the fabulously colorful costumes and production design--they're showing off cutting edge color. The sound is as good as it could be in 1952, and the fact that this is a musical helps show that off. The sets and effects are complex and an attempt is made to show them off as well.Donen and Kelly often play up the artificiality of the sets and effects to emphasize artistry and technology. This is clearly shown in the ""Make 'Em Laugh"" sequence (and surrounding events) and the extended ""Broadway Rhythm Ballet"" sequence with Cyd Charisse. Showing off this artistry and technology also occurs very subtly, as with the rain in the ""Singing in the Rain"" sequence. Even today, rain machines are frequently employed in a way that it appears to be raining on film, but in reality, it's just enough coverage to produce the illusion. In the ""Singing in the Rain"" sequence, they make sure that you can see the whole area is getting flooded, and they use Gene Kelly's umbrella, as torrents of water bounce off of it, to emphasize that no matter where he goes, ""rain"" is pouring down on him.While there are many musicals I like as much as Singing in The Rain, this is one of the better-loved examples of that genre, and for good reason. Any musical lover has surely seen this already, and if not, they should run out now and pick it up on DVD. If you're relatively unfamiliar with classic Hollywood musicals, this is one of the best places to start.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
It Ain't Been in Vain for Nothing,"Singin' in the Rain is one of the best movies ever made. The film is beautiful, tuneful, and loads of fun. While it pokes fun at Hollywood it also does so with great love. Little bits and pieces of Hollywood lore find their way into this great film and it's a pleasure to get the joke or recognize the real star they're referring to.The star trio is just perfect: Gene Kelly give a funny performance as the hammy silent actor; Donald O'Connor makes the most of his ""second banana"" role; Debbie Reynolds is perfect as the ingénue trying to break into films.The three stars perform many memorable numbers, including Kelly's ""Singin' in the Rain"" classic; all three in the ""Good Mornin'"" number; O'Connor's ""Make 'Em Laugh""; and Kelly and Reynolds in ""You Were Meant for Me."" The masterpiece however may be the ""Gotta Dance"" production number with Kelly and Cyd Charissejust perfect. Also great fun are O'Connor and Kelly in ""Fit as a Fiddle"" and ""Moses Supposes.""There are of course other production numbers, including the montage that shows Hollywood's race to transition to talkies, a scene that ends in the ""Beautiful Girl"" number featuring Jimmy Thompson.Jean Hagen (as Lina Lamont) won an Oscar nomination and steals the film in a classic comedy performance. Also good are Millard Mitchell, Douglas Fowley, Rita Moreno, King Donovan, Kathleen Freeman, Mae Clarke, Julius Tannen, and Madge Blake.The great trick to this film is that while Reynolds is supposedly ""lip syncing"" for Hagen, it's really Hagen's voice that Reynolds is miming to as in the ""I Would, Would You"" number. The final miming act is Hagen mouthing ""Singin' in the Rain"" is really Reynolds. It gets so confusing you can't tell who is lip syncing whose voice.Lots of Hollywood lore retold in this film. Hagen's Lamont character is a veiled reference to Norma Talmadge, who supposedly failed in talkies because of her New York accent. It's also a reference to Louise Brooks, whose talkie debut in The Canary Murder Case was all dubbed. When Kelly screams ""I LOVE YOU"" it's a reference to John Gilbert in is talkie debut flop. His Glorious Night. Kathleen Freeman's diction coach character is a reference to Constance Collier, who returned to Hollywood as a coach. And on it goes.A great film!",,Anonymous,Romance
The talkies,"The transition from the silent film era to the newly arrived technique of the 'talkies' proved to be the ruin for many well established stars that were great on the screen, but who had no professional training in the theater, or otherwise, and had horrible speaking voices. Thus, a star of the magnitude of Lina Lamont, suffers a hard blow to her career and ego.That's the basis of one of the best movies about old Hollywood of all times: ""Singin' in the Rain"". The film is one of the classics it is because of the marvelous direction of Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, two men who knew a lot about musicals. The screen play is by one of the best people in the business, Betty Comden and Adolph Green.MGM was the studio that employed all the stars one sees in the film, and what a cast they put together: Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds, Jean Hagen, Cyd Charisse in a dancing part, Millard Mitchell and Rita Moreno. As if those names weren't big enough, there is the fantastic musical numbers that even, viewing them today, have kept their freshness because of the care in which this film was crafted.""Singin' in the Rain"" is one of the best musicals of all times. It's right up there with the best of them thanks to the vision of Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen and it will live forever as more people discover this wonderful example of entertainment.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best Hollywood musicals,"This isn't my all time favorite (that goes to ""Meet me in St. Louis"") but this is definitely in the top 10. This is a fictitous musical comedy of the 1920s when silent films became ""talkies"". It chronicles how it affects Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly), his leading lady Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), best friend Cosmo (Donald O'Connor) and Lockwood's new girlfriend Kathey Selden (Debbie Reynolds). Problem is Lina has a voice that can cut glass and doesn't like lockwood falling for Selden...This movie has one highlight after another. Almost all the numbers are great--the title tune, ""Make 'Em Laugh"", ""Beautiful Girl"", ""Good Morning"" on and on. My two favorites are two short ones: ""Fit as a Fiddle"" which has incredible dancing from Kelly and O'Connor and ""Would You?"" at the end. Kelly isn't that good acting (he never was) but his dancing is superb; Reynolds (only 19 when she did this) is beautiful, energetic and full of life; Hagen is uproarious as Lamont (she was nominated for an Academy Award--she should have won!) and O'Connor is just great as Cosmo (his ""Make Em' Laugh"" number has astounding dancing). It's hard to believe that Reynolds and O'Connor hated working with Kelly (he was obnoxious, VERY demanding and a tyrant)--it's a credit to their acting that it never comes through.I only have one (small) complaint--the big, elaborate production number with Cyd Charisse in the middle. It LOOKS great and colorful--but it brings the film to a screeching halt and is way too long. After it ends I have trouble remembering where the film left off! Still, that's a small problem. This remains one of the 10 best movie musicals ever made. HIGHLY recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"The dancingest, funniest musical of Hollywood's golden age.","Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen have produced the best musical written directly for the screen. They have used the period in film history during the transition to sound movies and embroidered it with the wonderful songbook of Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown. The icing on the cake, of course is the choreography of Kelly and Donen. From the first moment, the movie takes flight as Kelly relates the tale of his rise as a silent film star with his sidekick, the incomparable Donald O'Connor. Watch the flying feet of O'Connor and Kelly in the ""Fit as a Fiddle"" number. It doesn't get much better than this. Everyone is familiar with the classic ""Singin' in the Rain"" sequence. Donald O'Connor's hysterical ""Make 'em Laugh"" number is probably the funniest musical three minutes on film. Even the Broadway Ballet is a kaleidoscope of color and movement, with a minimum of the highbrow balletic choreography found in the later ""An American in Paris.""What makes ""Singin'"" such an entertaining classic is its superb integration of comedy and music. Jean Hagen gives the performance of her life as the vocally challenged silent film star, Lena Lamont. Every scene she's in is a comic gem. Her ""fingernails on a blackboard"" voice and massacre of the English language make her a figure of ridicule. However, in the end when she finally gets her comeuppance, one can't help feeling a little sorry for her.This delightful film has been given its due on video. On VHS it can be purchased with the complete remastered soundtrack on CD. The laserdisc versions include one with commentary by film historian Ronald Haver (Criterion) and the film-only version from MGM/UA Home Video with a restored Dolby Digital stereo soundtrack., Last,but not least,is a masterful rendering on DVD with, unfortunately, no supplementary material to speak of.This is truly a film for all time that can be watched just for its entertainment value and studied as probably the apex of the Hollywood musical in its Golden Age.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Genial, Strongly-Made Satire With Music About the Early Days of Talkies","""Singin' In the Rain"" I find to be a relaxed musical, one whose subject is the traumatic changeover that was faced by Hollywood producers, actors and directors when sound was introduced into film circa 1928. Many fans and critics believe the musical is one of the best ever; I disagree. But it is quite unusual in several respects, I suggest: first because its background is so realistic as a milieu from which to draw appealing characters and opportunities to introduce songs; and second because the film is played on the edge of parody without ever really falling into that error. The three characters at the center of the film are a love triangle. Don Lockwood, played amiably by Gene Kelly, is the on-screen partner of Lina Lamont (Oscar-worthy Jean Hagen); she has mistaken his sincere performance for real interest; he is in love with Kathy Selden, played by too-young but plucky nineteen-year-old Debbie Reynolds, about whom Lina knows nothing. The professional duo are completing one more romantic adventure film as a silent when suddenly sound is introduced into movies. The studio executives panic; and Don and his partner, played by Donald O'Connor, convince the director, craggy-faced and very realistic Douglas Fowley, to get the studio to let them remake the film as a musical--completing the unfinished portion, etc. The problem turns out not to be Don's transition to talkies but Lina's; she has the voice of a screech owl. Coaching becomes necessary; sensational dance numbers are introduced, including Kelly's solo ""Singin' in the Rain"", motivated by his falling in love with Kathy; Donald O'Connor's ""Make 'Em Laugh"" acrobatic classic; and the unnecessary but very-well-done ""Gotta Dance"" showcase ballet with Cyd Charisse as a gangster's moll, and Kelly as a Broadway hopeful. Then, the film is completed and debuted; of course Lina has found out about Kathy. And of course this intelligent satire works out well for all concerned, after some trials and tribulations. Great fun is gotten I suggest from the actors having to learn to ""talk into the flowers"", where early microphones had to be hidden, etc. Harold Rosson provided the cinematography, with art direction by Randall Duell and Cedric Gibbons. Nacio Herb Brown's songs were intelligently recycled for the film. Arthur Freed, MGM's master musical specialist, had the use of the talents of Betty Comden and Adolph Green for the screenplay and one song, ""Moses Supposes""; he also had then-28- year-old nice guy Stanley Donen as director, soon to add ""On The Town"" and ""Seven Brides For Seven Brothers"" to this triumph. Walter Plunkett did the period costumes, with complex set decorations being done by Jacques Mapes and Edwin B. Willis. The studio's boss was played by Millard Mitchell, with Rita Moreno and a dozen familiar faces in smaller parts and uncredited appearances such as Joi Lansing, Paul Maxey, Sylvia Lewis, Kathleen freeman, King Donovan, Dawn Addams, Elaine Edwards, Mae Clarke and Snub Pollard. The film was influential, I assert, my criterion for including it among these reviews, because, immediately afterward, other 1920s and period projects were inspired by its success; these included, ""Has Anybody Seen My Gal"", the TV show ""So This is Hollytwood"", and ultimately ""The Great Race"", ""The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond Story"" and a hundred others, including a few musicals. I consider it to be genial, a clever period evocation, lightweight, exuberant, youthful, and a very seminal work with a strong central character and unusually-interesting reality background.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just amazing! One of the best musicals ever made!,"This absolutely delightful film has everything I love in a musical, and is definitely one of the greatest musicals ever made.(I love them) I personally think the film's main merit is the electrifying choreography, evident in the songs, Make Em Laugh, Roses, Good Morning and especially Broadway Melody.As for the songs, they are superb, and quite rightly some of the finest in the history of musicals, and somehow they remind me of Easter Parade. The performances give a rare sense of energy and charm, particularly Gene Kelly as Donald Lockwood, also co-director. His rendition of the title is possibly the most famous scene in the movie, and is pretty extraordinary. Donald O'Connor is hilarious as Cosmo and Debbie Reynolds, with her lovely appearance and fabulous voice is perfectly appealing. Jean Hagen is quite hysterical as Lina, the source of the film's ongoing joke, that her character can't act, dance or sing, and her acting in the talkie was intentionally laughable. Also nice to see the beautiful long-legged Cyd Charisse and Rita Moreno. (best known for Anita in West Side Story)The plot mayn't be the best merit of the film, but with everything else so good, it is such a minor criticism. All in all, a wonderful film, that is well worth watching for the song and dance numbers alone. 10/10 Bethany Cox.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Dated, but fun...","This film, one of the greatest (if not THE greatest) musicals ever made, unfortunately shows its age.  Redeemed by several outstanding song and dance routines, the film is a fun and fast way to spend 90 minutes or so. However, at the risk of sounding jaded, much of the film is corny and borderline mawkish.  It has not aged well.  I recently saw ""Singin' in the Rain"" at Oakland's Paramount Theatre, a refurbished '20s movie house that can accommodate huge crowds in its big-screen auditorium.  (Those that can should attend - tickets are generally $5, and while food and drink are not allowed in the movie, they have a full bar and beverage service before the show.  Films selected are usually ""classics"" like ""Gone With The Wind"" or ""Casablanca"", and they have live organ music and Deco Win before each film.) I was amused by both Donald O'Connor, who is great, and the film's dated sensibilities.  Many people were humming to Gene Kelly's famous solo, however, and that's what counts.  That particular scene must be among the ten greatest or most memorable in film history, and it never disappoints.  I rated the film a ""7"" just for that scene alone.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Good dance numbers, interesting as historical reference","I only watched this movie because I am making my way through the AFI top 100, and it another one of those 50's movies that are cringe worthy by today's standards but it is interesting to watch as historical reference. Musicals are tough to get through normally, but 50's musicals are even tougher, especially Gene Kelly musicals.It is important to remember that during this time America was trying to rebuild society both internally, and around the world, as well as trying to forget the horrors of WWII. Enter Gene Kelly with enough schmalz to kill an elephant. So much so that it seems like a parody. It is interesting to see a movie made at a time (the 50's) looking back to a *previous* time (the 20's) and portraying that as even MORE cutesy and ""gosh gee wiz"". After watching An American in Paris, I realize that this has a lot to do with Gene Kelley, As a dancer he is amazing, and Donald O'Connor is equally impressive, but that's about it. After a while it becomes more painful to watch a middle aged man falling for a late teens/early twenties girl (Debbie Reynolds was 19 in this movie). Also for all it's praise, the iconic singin in the rain dance sequence has some bad tap dancing overdubs.What is interesting is as you read behind the scenes you learn about how difficult the movie was to make for everyone (Oconnor collapsed after he had to redo his famous make em laugh sequence and Reynolds was reduced to tears trying to learn the dance steps) yet they're beaming with big smiles. It is symbolic of America in the 50's, smiling on the outside while you are in pain on the inside.Another thing that is hard to watch is all the garish costumes, so many ugly colors! Historical reference is import here as well since movies in color was a new thing, and it's painfully obvious that they really wanted to show it off.So overall, some impressive sequences, some good songs and a reference point for what hollywood was before the neo realism wave of the 1960s and 70s, but not much else. If you like sugary sweet fluff, this is your film.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

I'm happy again!,"Singing In The Rain is to me the greatest musical ever made, sure many others push it close, The Wizard Of Oz for one will always be a 10/10 movie in my opinion, but Singing In The Rain is a film that has no flaws, it is a perfect movie.Don Lockwood is a star of silent movies but his life is boring, then talking movies arrive and with them he eyes an opportunity to greatly improve his life. A chance encounter with dancer Kathy Selden will further shape his destiny, and along with best pal and partner Cosmo Brown, their respective fortunes will hopefully dovetail towards fulfillment.Where do you start? The film is a homage to happiness, be it film making or love, or friendships and honour, the film is pure and simply joyous from the first reel to the triumphant last shot. Featuring stunning choreography, Singing In The Rain doesn't cop out by merely having characters plodding thru a script and then bursting into song occasionally, each song furthers the characters and fleshes out the story unfolding to keep the plot lines tight and crucially, important.Make 'Em Laugh, Good Morning, and Singing In The Rain are just some of the brilliant songs and dance routines on show here, with the latter a now legendary piece of cinematic history that speaks volumes for the joyous nature of the film, whilst the finale sequence of the 'Broadway Ballet' is magic & elegance personified. The cast are uniformly excellent, Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor & Debbie Reynolds interplay together like they were hatched from the same egg, and the joint direction from Stanley Donen (along with Kelly) is seamless.Full of hat tipping and self-referencing winks, Singing In The Rain regularly hits the top ten lists of critics and movie fans alike, so lets not beat around the bush about it...it flipping well deserves it. 10/10 in every respect.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Divine Miss Charisse,"I'm going to confine my comments about ""Singin' in the Rain"" to the ""Broadway Rhythm"" sequence where Cyd Charisse steals the movie without saying a word. In my view, Charisse, who is still gorgeous at 83, was the quintessential movie dancer of the 1950s. Her height, elegance, aloofness and those impossibly long legs -- along with an uncanny ability to match her style to that of her partner -- makes watching her dance a mesmerizing experience.Many have said that the two numbers in ""Singin' in the Rain"" that feature Charisse probably belong in another movie. I don't know as the flapper in jade, she sexes up Kelly's rube character to a steamy height unusual in movies of that era. In a dance full of wonderful moves, my favorite comes after she's left him with her cigarette holder. She sashays away from him, blowing on her nails in studied boredom. She's gotten some distance away, and as she tosses her right hand back, he throws down the cigarette holder, grabs her hand and brings her flying up to his chest, where she proceeds to slide down Kelly's thigh to the floor for one of several prone positions she takes during this duet, from which she returns to a standing position with amazing grace. I'm not wild about dances that rely heavily on props, but this one does so very effectively: they're amusing and they reinforce character.And thank heaven for the artistic control that allowed Kelly to keep the ""crazy veil"" number in the picture. Charisse has discussed that dance, where she got to show off her early ballet training, most charmingly for a ""Word of Mouth"" feature on TCM. She and others have noted over the years that the wind machines required to keep that impossibly long veil moving and undulating between and above her and Kelly made filming a nightmare. But it looks effortless, on a set that is a subtle optical illusionnot as deep nor as sloped as it appears to be.Both dances end the same way. Whether she's a cheap gangster's moll in garish green or a Grecian goddess in white, less obviously in a mobster's sway, Charisse is invariably lured back to reality by proffered baubles and menacingly tossed coins. But at the end of the crazy veil number, she's the one tossing the coins.Wonderful.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"What a glorious feeling, indeed!","Everybody remembers the scene. It's the one where he walks along the street, dancing, and singin' in the rain. The musical sequence has yet to be surpassed by any film -- even my all-time-favorite musical, ""Grease"" (1978), doesn't stand a chance. In fact, there's another great musical number in ""Singin' in the Rain,"" with Donald O'Connor throwing his body around like a rag doll. Even though the singin' in the rain number is the infamous trademark of the film and musicals everywhere, my personal favorite is ""Make 'em Laugh.""Not many people know, however, that Gene Kelly had a 103 degree fever during the filming of the infamous scene -- a dangerous thing to do, in retrospect, considering that he was flailing about and working up a sweat in pouring water with such a high temperature. But even then, not many people know that the ""rain water"" pouring down on the joyously cheesy street was actually composed of water and milk. The milk was added to the mix in an effort to achieve the effect of raindrops showing up on screen. (Mel Gibson noted once that most of the time during the filming of ""Braveheart"" it was raining around them, but it was basically impossible to notice any rainfall in the film since the sheets of liquid were so thin.)""Singin' in the Rain"" can probably be called the greatest musical of all time, even though my guilty pleasure is ""Grease"" (how outdated the film is, and yet how amusing it remains!). Every serious filmgoer knows this movie, and just yesterday as I watched Britain's countdown to the greatest musical ever made, I noted that ""Singin' in the Rain"" was high on the list (""Grease"" was no. 1, although any list that posts ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Musical"" higher on a list than ""Singin' in the Rain"" can't be trusted).Don Lockwood (Kelly) is a silent film star in 1927, an ex-musician living an on-screen romance with Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) and letting the publicity take their screen relationship to a whole new level (think Ben and Jen's recent tabloid romance). The press loves to think that its two biggest stars are the nation's cutest couple, but in reality Lockwood despises Lamont, and Lamont -- having read trashy magazines -- believes their relationship to be factual. ""Oh, Donny!"" Lina cries. ""You couldn't kiss my like that and not mean it just a teensy bit!"" Lockwood: ""Meet the greatest actor in the world -- I'd rather kiss a tarantula."" Lina: ""You don't mean that."" Lockwood: ""I don't? Hey Joe, get me a tarantula!""When the silent film studio begins the transition from silent film to new ""talkies,"" it means that Lockwood will have to take acting lessons in able to learn to truly be able to act, and Lamont -- a squeaky-voiced young lady -- will have to learn to learn proper grammar. (Some scenes with a grammar instructor reminded me of ""My Fair Lady,"" truth be told, although it was filmed 12 years afterwards.)Lockwood meets a young girl named Kathy Seldon (Debbie Reynolds), who refuses to fall victim to his Hollywood charm but eventually learns to love the guy after he gets her out of a tight squeeze or two.Meanwhile, Lockwood's pal, Cosmo (O'Connor), suggests that they start to stage film musicals instead of feature ""talkies"" -- that way, all Lockwood needs to do is sing and dance, something he already excels at. (""Make a musical! The new Don Lockwood: he yodels! He jumps about to music!"")But people want Lockwood and Lamont, not Lockwood by himself, and the prospect of losing money is not a bright prospect for the film company. So Lina is filmed in the musicals with him, and towards the end of our film, sweet young Kathy dubs over Lina's voice and is given no credit for the task. Lamont is too embarrassed to admit that she can't sing, and so she blackmails the film distributor -- if they credit Kathy at the end of her new feature film, she'll take legal action.And so comes the climatic finale on stage as Lockwood reveals the true singer behind the film (ironic, since it was Lamont herself who dubbed over Reynolds' voice during the sequence). As Roger Ebert noted, the scene where Lockwood bursts onto stage and fingers out Kathy from the crowd of onlookers is corny, but it's sweet and exactly the time of emotionally uplifting moment that is rarely made nowadays.Gene Kelly's notorious cruelty on the set of ""Singin' in the Rain"" has become a sort of folklore, and it's true. He berated the actors if they messed up a single dance number. O'Connor later admitted that he was extremely frightened to make a single mistake, afraid that Kelly would lash out at him.That strictness doesn't shine through Kelly's character in ""Singin' in the Rain."" In fact, many of the dance moves (such as the frantic splashing in the puddles) look quite haphazard, but they were all choreographed to an extreme.Is that why the film is highly regarded as perhaps the definitive American musical? That probably has something to do with it. I think it's mostly the joy of it all, though -- bright, cheery, happy, and uplifting, the film is one of the most purely fun films of all time. It doesn't demand anything like some films, but it gives a lot back.The ads for ""Singin' in the Rain"" promised a glorious feeling, and in that way the film lives up to its slogan. It is fun and bright and glorious and entertaining. It doesn't take itself seriously, but it offers the viewer a chance to experience something quite rare -- an all-around great movie.What a glorious feeling, indeed.5/5.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Singin' will Sing forever!!,"It has long been thought that the musical era was born out of pure enthusiasm over the ability to put sound on film.  And while the case holds water, it is not entirely correct.  As `Singin' In the Rain,' so eloquently shows; comedy, charm, music, and dance can all be featured successfully within one film.`Singin In the Rain,' is also generally known as the greatest musical of all time.  Roger Ebert, the late Gene Siskel, Leonard Maltin, and many other prominent critics agree with that opinion.  The plot was born from a song and used others that had been around for many years, ever since `the talkies' were born in the late 20s.  The screenplay was written according to the songs.  Although the cast had been cast,  and re-cast several times; the end result was one of perfect chemistry.  The combination of the ever-so talented Gene Kelly (arguably 1 of the 2 best film dancers ever) and Debbie Reynolds worked very well, despite complications that arose off the set. And Donald O'Connor was born for his role as Cosmo Brown, the best buddy to Kelly's Don Lockwood.  His wit keeps the film fresh and funny.  If you took a drink for every smart remark he made, you'd be drunk, before Lockwood gets the girl!All the characters in this film are dynamic, save Cosmo Brown and Lena Lamont (played by Jean Hagen).  This was perfect for what was called for, for this film to succeed.  This helps the film `move,' where other musicals fail.  This is where the irony enters; since this film was written in reverse of this philosophy.  Being able to incorporate quality songs into a quality storyline is a skill no studio has ever mastered, even to this day. Even, MGM, which was known as `the king of the musicals', failed more often than it succeeded.  To this day, no one has mastered it; although Disney has almost reached MGM proportions with its animation department.As the film opens, the premiere for one of the famed `Lockwood/Lamont' films is taking place for `The Royal Rascal.' As the stars arrive, one by one, Cosmo Brown arrives.  A bit later Lockwood and Lamont arrive. Lockwood tells a `story' of how he and Cosmo get to stardom.  To celebrate the release, there is a party at the studio's producer's house.  But to get there, Lockwood must go by a different rout than everyone else, finding Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) in the process.  After a few cute surprises and accidents, Don gets a conscience attack.  After finally finding her, he realizes that he cares for her.  Meanwhile, Cosmo Brown keeps up his antics and funny nature.  The comic relief is never amiss in this film.  Lamont soon learns of the romance and is up to something, but what?  What do you think she is, `.dumb or something?'The co-director (also co-directed by Gene Kelly) Stanley Donen called the `Moses Supposes' dance sequence with Kelly and  O'Connor, the best dance sequence ever.  I agree that it is in the Top 3, but not the best, that's in another film; which Donen directed, for another review.  All numbers in this film are memorable, where most from other films are not.There is only one detraction in this film.  It is the `Broadway Melody' sequence.  It begins with another interesting and amusing song and dance number by Mr. Lockwood, trying to convince his producer of something.  But the scene becomes too long and unnecessary.  Cyd Charisse is an amazing talent, but the dance number she has in the film, should have been deleted. It is mesmerizing, but is out of place in this film.  This 13 minute sequence should have ended at about 7-8 max.  Still, this detail is so minute, that it isn't a bad detraction. When this film was released in 1952, it opened to luke-warm reviews and average box office receipts.  It wasn't until it's `10th Anniversary,' that people began to notice that `Singin' In the Rain' was special and has been known as such ever since.  The AFI, when it released it's list of `The 100 Greatest Films Ever,' ranked this film No.10, to put it at the highest mark for a musical of any era and place Ms. Debbie Reynolds as half of the only mother/daughter combination on the list*.  `Singin' In the Rain,' is always fun to watch, the film has also been recently released on DVD with tons of extras.  As enduring as Mr. Kelly's lamppost lean is, so this film echoes Mr. Lockwood's sentiments of nothing; nothing but pure joy that is.Personal Rating: 99 on a 100 point scale*Note-Ms. Reynolds' daughter, Carrie Fisher appeared in AFI's No. 15 film, `Star Wars.'",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Most entertaining movie ever made!,"A perfect movie in every sense, 'Singin In The Rain' has rightly gone down in history as the best musical picture ever. But it is much more than that. A sparkling comedy, with a cast that is 100% perfect, and one of the best movies about movies ever made too.Gene Kelly's genius has never been more apparent than in this movie, but, as always he never steals the show, in fact here practically having the show stolen from him by Donald O'Connor's gravity defying 'Make 'Em Laugh' and Jean Hagen's unforgettable Lina Lamont. Kelly's title number is the epitome of carefree nonchalance. The guy's in love and he isn't going to let a little rain get in the way. This 'classic' scene is possibly the feelgood moment to beat all others. I defy anyone not to succumb to the Kelly's Irish charm during this number, if you haven't already been won over.But a musical is just a musical without a decent story. That's where Comden and Green's pertinent screenplay comes in. Using Nacio Herb Brown's songs from the era in which the movie is set we are taken back to Hollywood in transition, a time when silent movies were ousted by the talkies. For what is generally regarded as just a light-hearted song and dance movie 'Singin In The Rain' takes a pretty accurate line and takes a satirical swipe at the studios and the gossip mongers of the day. There were stars, like Lina Lamont, whose careers disintegrated on the advent of talking pictures, and others, like Kathy Seldon, whose stars were beginning to rise. For a while, there weren't enough voice coaches to go round! The race to match the success of 'The Jazz Singer' was truly chaotic, with studios churning out potboiler after potboiler to cash in on the talking picture. It was also a time when MGM itself started it's reign of the musical genre with epic production numbers, and casts of thousands. In a sense,'Singin In The Rain' both lampoons and celebrates it's own ancestry and place in cinema history.Exhilarating, exuberant, and mesmerising. Still, in my opinion, the most entertaining, and the best, movie ever made!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Timeless Perfection from Hollywood's Studio System,"Up there with film classics such as 'Casablanca' and Orson Wells' groundbreaking 'Citizen Kane', 'Singin' in the Rain' is one of the all-time top films to come out of Hollywood. Considered by many (including the American Film Institute) to be the greatest film musical, 'Singin' in the Rain' , with its awesome production values, was made 12 years before the stunning 'West Side Story'.When I first saw the film as a teenager, however, failing to see beyond its American sugar-floss sentimentality, I arrogantly despised it. Yet just one year later I sat through it again and instantly came under its spell, caught up in a magic that has never left me. 'Singin' in the Rain' is a riot of self-indulgent fun, studio skulduggery, romance and innocence of not just one, but two by-gone ages: and therein lieth part of its enduring magic. In rich Technicolor, with some of the finest and slickest visual stunts, (it all looks so effortless on screen) along with some of the greatest song and dance numbers, no one can really say they 'know Hollywood' until they've laughed and cried their way through this film. Parodying a Hollywood back in the days when sound was first coming to the silver screen, it simultaneously reflects the late 1920s, in which the film is set, and the early '50s, (the era in which it was produced). Thus, unwittingly encapsulating much of the entire golden age of Hollywood in one motion picture, like fine wine, it has simply matured with age. The production values are so flawlessly high that I sometimes have to pinch myself to remember that the film recreates in song and dance an era some 25 years earlier..All the songs, including the famous title number, are revivals of numbers that appeared in early sound films, giving the film an air of authenticity. Donald O'Connor's 'Make 'Em Laugh' number is a particular highpoint to watch out for. The typically flamboyant Gene Kelly ballet sequence in the second half is slightly more controversial, with some viewers feeling that despite its brilliant choreography and staging, it slows the action and is out of touch with the naive innocence of the rest of the film, but others view it is the sequence that makes the movie, giving it balance.It is worth noting that this ballet sequence probably would never have made it into the film at all has it not been for the stunning 1948 British film, 'The Red Shoes' (produced by Powell and Pressburger). The ballet sequence featuring Moira Shearer included 15 minutes of uninterrupted, dialogue-free screen time. Gene Kelly loved it, and thanks to the critical and popular success of 'The Red Shoes', (photographed by the legendary Jack Cardiff), Kelly convinced producer Arthur Freed that ballet on film was commercially viable.Just five months before the 1952 premier of 'Singin' in the Rain', MGM had released another major Gene Kelly musical, 'An American in Paris', and initially, this was the film critics preferred. However, with audiences making 'Singin' in the Rain' a box-office hit from the very start, critical opinion began to change and it soon became clear that 'Singin' in the Rain' possessed a timeless quality approaching sheer perfection, revealing that the whole is often greater than the sum of its parts. Overall, in a happy combination of chance and design, (not forgetting the chemistry a 19 year-old Debbie Reynolds brought to the screen and Adolph Green and Betty Comden's wonderful script), the production elements in 'Singin' in the Rain' flow together perfectly, revealing just how well the Hollywood studio system really could work at those special moments when everyone, craftsmen and artists alike, were on peak form.Due to loving restoration and the marvels of modern digital transfers, we can now see the film as it originally looked, in all its brilliant colour saturation - a far cry from the washed out versions you may have seen as Christmas time TV fodder. If this is the fist time you've ever seen it, then I hope you are wiser than I was, and that you fall in love with this timeless picture first time around: it really is a cinema treat for all ages!

Overrated as a film,"Let's get things straight: this is by no means a bad musical. There are some wonderful numbers- ""Make Em' Laugh"", ""Good Morning"", that one where the gal with the long leg dangles a hat in front of Gene Kelly- but the film itself is disappointing. I've always found Gene Kelly too arrogant and annoying to want to watch him as a romantic lead, a bit too uptight to be comic and his dancing's better in An American in Paris. Debbie Reynolds is cute but not earth-shattering. Donald O'Connor is fabulous- he's the reason to watch this film. His talent, particularly for comedy, exceeds Kelly's talents. He's definitely underrated.I was told that the whole spoofing of the advent of the talkies was hilarious. It's mildly amusing at best. The characters didn't really grab me either. It's a total myth that the story of a musical can get away with being complete fluff. Even if the story's a bit of a stretch (or a lot if it's Brigadoon), it should at least be entertaining. This film really ought to have simply been a revue.I think that nostalgia and hype may have clouded the judgement of quite a few viewers.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Deserves Every Accolade,"This is one of those handful of films that is universally loved and respected and I have to join the crowd on that. For over 50 years it has been considered the best musical ever made and I can't argue with that, either, especially with the newly- restored DVD version that came out a short time ago. The film never looked and sounded better!In a nutshell, the reason for the high praise, I would think would be: 1 - Likable lead characters (Debbie Reynolds, Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor); 2 - Excellent song-and-dance numbers, capped off by one of the most famous of all-time, the title song ""Singin' In the Rain,"" featuring Kelly; 3 - Very good humor throughout the film, aided by Jean Hagen's dumb blonde imitation, which may be the best ever put on film; 4 - Spectacular color (please get this latest 2-disc DVD), and 5 - of course, simply a very entertaining film start-to-finish.A few side comments: Kelly gets the legacy with his title song dance but O'Connor's dancing in here is just as good. In fact, one of his solo routines reportedly exhausted him so much he could not work for five days. A nice bonus is seeing Cyd Charisse in here, showing off her dancing skills and great legs.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"There's certainly a lot of singing, some of it even in the rain","A movie about the early years of Hollywood. More specifically, about the transition period between the silent era and the so called talkies. One of the most well-known musicals of all time. The best musical of all time, if some critics are to be believed.And there definitely is a lot of musical content. The movie sees no problem in bursting into a song and dance number whenever it pleases. I'd even argue that it's a bit much. By the time the seventh or so tap dancing sequence rolled around, I was ready to throw in the towel. Granted, some of the song numbers are absolutely phenomenal, like the titular Singin' in the Rain or Good Morning that comes immediately before it.Luckily the film hits its stride around the middle and it's a much smoother sailing from there. Or I just got used to it. Who can say.The acting is also very good, which helps a lot. Gene Kelly not also directed the film, he also plays the lead role, and he's certainly having a blast with it. Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor, playing Kelly's love interest and best buddy, respectively, are also great and their joined song numbers are easily the most entertaining ones.Character-wise, the one thing I didn't quite get is the character of Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), the acting partner of Kelly's character. She's showcased as this great villain and is the primary antagonist of the film, but the way the film tried to portray her never quite matched with the actual character. Sure, she's self-centered, narcissistic and willing to trample others in her pursuit of fame, but she never seemed all that malicious to me. It seemed much more like she didn't know any other way to act.A film that certainly earns its status as a classic. It's a product of its era and quite different from modern films, but it has a lot of charm and energy, which carry it far. Recommended for fans of the musical genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A bit of a mess.,"Every now and then comes along a movie so iconic, everyone knows its name, even if they haven't seen it. And sometimes the hype greatly overstates the value. Singin' in the Rain has its good moments but it is also a mess of a movie.The main romance in the film came out of nowhere. It has that age old cliché where two people do not like each other at first but then fall in love, except the cliché is done badly. The dislike is very sudden, feels very forced to the point that it seemed like the main female character could not act. After the initial dislike there is no natural progression to a warmer relationship. It just becomes a fact at one point so the romance also feels very sudden and forced.The story as a whole has a disorienting structure, getting interrupted by parts that do not belong.The film is saturated with little jokes and slapstick and almost none of that stuff is funny! After a while the dumb forced humour becomes painful. There is a character played by Donald O'Connor whose mission it is to be a harlequin that got high on speed. He has a good delivery and can be funny but he also overdoes the whole clown business to the point of his character becoming annoying.The actors are definitely capable when they want to be, they sing very well and they dance well too. But those 3 aspects (acting, singing and dancing) are not tied together well. Look, if you wanted to make some random songs, make an album and put it on a record. If you are making a film with a story then it has to make sense and the songs in it have to be related. That is not the case here.On top of that, the songs are not all good either. There are two songs, Singin' in the Rain and Good Morning (to a lesser degree), that are discernibly interesting. The rest are average, some with primitive rhymes and of questionable purpose in the movie. There is one song that starts for no apparent reason and is not about anything, with its few lyrics being nonsensical babble. It is several minutes of your life you will never get back. The song could have been cut out of the film and it would have lost NOTHING.Moreover, the music is constantly being interrupted either for a change in tune or for another scene or for a dancing part. I like tap dancing too but quitting and interrupting the music into which your brain is trying to tune feels horrible, like getting mentally slapped. These dancing parts are not brief pauses either; they last a while and they too get interrupted by slapstick or other dancing scenes. What a mess.As the movie was drawing to a close I was bored and tired of it (my partner tuned out after just 10 minutes). And that is despite the fact that certain parts of this film are bouncing of the wall hyperactive. The music is good, the acting is good, but the structure is wrong. Next time someone asks me to watch this movie, they will need to get me high first, because clearly that is what the makers were when they made it.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Delightful!,"Many good things can be and have been said about this one and they're all true.  It's a great movie.

One of the best films I've ever seen,"Definitely one of the most genuinely feel-good films I've ever seen. For a musical, it did not fit the mold of being a bit on the corny side. And some musical films I've seen are a bit stale, but this one is far from that label. I was just beginning to see Gene Kelly's work (I had first seen An American in Paris--which is another gem) and I was captivated by his energy and how overall talented he is. Definitely a great dancer of his time. It was also the first film I saw of Debbie Reynolds' earlier work. It is very clear why it's considered one of the best films of all time. It's witty, romantic, charming, and contains beautiful musical numbers. I definitely recommend it to be an addition to anyones film collection.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
MGM Near the Top of Its Musical Game,"The heaps of scholarly criticism heaped on ""Singing' in the Rain"" have done it a disservice by giving it the ball and chain reputation of an IMPORTANT picture in cinema history. Let's not forget why ""Singin' in the Rain"" was made, which was to provide a form of escapist entertainment, nor why it's still so loved now, which is because it's great fun and everything clicks. It's not homework, and it's not medicine.I don't even think it's the best movie musical ever made (I liked MGM's ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"" more), and it's not one I feel compelled to go back to again and again. I'm not a huge fan of Gene Kelly, and think he's squirrelly when he's trying to be dashing, and Donald O'Connor's manic energy is just as likely to be exhausting as it is funny. But there's no improving on Jean Hagen's pitch-perfect performance as the ditzy villainess, and Debbie Reynolds shows how sweet and charming she was early in her career, before she became a broad.The songs and dances aren't especially well integrated into the film --you can practically hear the gears grinding whenever the film transitions from its book to its musical portions. But the numbers are so wildly entertaining in and of themselves that you don't much care. The ""Singin' in the Rain"" sequence does what far too few films do -- it transports you to a place where what's happening on the screen in front of you is the only thing that matters.Grade: A-",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

We Lived The Research,"In the book The Films of Arthur Freed, Freed made one comment about Singin' in the Rain that always stood out in my mind. As the film was about the Hollywood era when films were learning to talk, Freed said that there was no need to do any research as he lived the research. He and any number of people who were still working at MGM a quarter of a century later.The knowledge that folks had who worked on Singin' in the Rain and the talent of Gene Kelly are the two things that make that film some consider the greatest of all musicals.Arthur Freed who wrote a lot of the song lyrics in those twenties and thirties MGM musicals together with his partner, composer Nacio Herb Brown, just reached into his own catalog for the score. The whole score is Brown-Freed except for Moses which was written by Roger Edens and Adolph Green and Betty Comden and Fit As A Fiddler with lyrics by Freed and music by Al Goodheart and Al Hoffman.The only 'original' song written for the show was Make 'Em Laugh by Brown and Freed and was Donald O'Connor's specialty. You have to put that in quotes because even the writers agreed they ripped off Cole Porter's Be A Clown. Which is from an MGM musical that Arthur Freed produced. Lucky they weren't sued.Of course the number that Singin' in the Rain is noted for is the title tune sung and danced in the splashing rain by Gene Kelly. That and the Broadway Melody ballet became two of his signature numbers. I know I don't enjoy myself as much as Mr. Kelly did in that inclement weather.Jean Hagen got a Best Supporting Actress nomination for playing that 'shimmering star in the cinema firmament' Lina Lamont. Unfortunately she lost to Gloria Grahame for The Bad and The Beautiful. One thing that the silent screen did was mask a whole lot of personalities whose voices did not fit the screen image created.That was done for great comic affect by Hagen, but Kelly in some of his love scenes was using the tragedy of John Gilbert who acted in two much the classical manner as a continental lover. Just think how history might have been different if Gilbert had the background of a song and dance man and could have transitioned to musicals.Of course Debbie Reynolds is just fine in her first real starring part as the young singing hopeful whose career is made by sound. So many in fact were, as many as those that were broken. A favorite of mine in this is Douglas Fowley the harassed director trying to get a talking performance out of the nasal Hagen and dealing with the new technology at the same time.As Freed said, no research was needed. Singin' in the Rain is a product of his life experience in those early days of sound.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Movie Review: Singin' in the Rain,"Singin 'in the Rain is a classic musical in every regard and has gathered a large following of people who claim that it is the best musical ever conceived. The movie has a big emphasis on the new technology that was being used at the time that allowed actors to actually talk and audiences could hear them, this was not new technology when the movie was made in the 1950s, however this movie is set in the 1920s when this technology was still new. The actors all do a really great job throughout all of the musicals shown in the movie, especially Gene Kelly as he was the one of the people that Choreographed a lot of the musical scenes. I personally thought this movie was a fun watch even though I don't really care for musicals in general, I can definitely see why so many people really like this movie. I would recommend this movie to anybody who likes musicals as many people would see that this is a must watch for the musical genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
best film musical of all time?! I don't think so G.,"I watched this film with the expectation that it would have a good storyline that would keep my interest like Oliver, My Fair Lady, or at least Mary Poppins. I was sorely disappointed. This film has been called ""the best"" film musical of all time. I do not share that opinion.The characters were campy. Gene Kelly was far too happy all the time and it made it very difficult for me to watch him. The dumb blonde played by Jean Hagen was an exception. I found her to be very funny (apparently so did Frank Loesser in that he plagiarized her character in his musical ""How to Succeed at Business Without Really Trying"".) The supporting cast was fair and Debbie Reynolds was competent but I really see no reason to rave about this musical.I would take Fred Astaire over Gene Kelly any day for choreography. The story is rudely and abruptly interrupted by this ridiculous ""vision"" that Kelly has where he is suddenly on Broadway or at a burlesque show and this horrible dance sequence that lasted forever, all in the name of his character finding a good ending to their swashbuckling movie. From swashbuckler to Broadway is a bit of a stretch. Speaking of stretch, visions shouldn't take up half a movie in MY book.This movie was genuinely bad. I am sorry that this is considered a classic. I guess we can look for future generations to hail the Beegee's and Peter Frampton for their ""ingenious"" work when they name ""Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" a musical ""classic"" as well. After I saw ""Singin' In The Rain"" I could clearly see why the musical genre took a steep dive back then.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Spectacular,"Everybody knows Gene Kelly singing and dancing in the films title number, but this is just one of the many magical musical numbers in this epic piece of blissful entertainment. Set during the turbulent period when Hollywood was converting from silent films to sound, Singin' in the Rain' is a perfect example of everything that is good and right about movie-making. Gene Kelly in his greatest role is an all singing, all dancing sensation and his acting is pretty damn good too. Donald O'Connor excels as his exuberant sidekick and almost steals the show with the unsurpassed Make em Laugh'. Debbie Reynolds is feisty and sexy as Kelly's love interest, while Jean Hagen gives one of the screen's greatest supporting performances as the horrid Lena Lamont, a silent screen goddess whose voice will just not cut it in talkies.The musical numbers flow fast and furious as Gene and Donald perform amazing feats of choreography with Fit as a Fiddle' and Moses Supposes' while Good Mornin' will have you dancing in the aisles. If Singin' in the Rain' had no musical numbers it would still be a contender for the funniest film ever made. The problems with experiments with sound films are painfully funny, and Kelly's silent sparring with the demonic Hagen is hilarious. The accolade of sheer perfection can be conferred on few films, and such a title is perhaps even an understatement in this case. And never before did rain look like so much fun.",,Anonymous,Romance
The...best...musical...EVER!,"I watched Singin' in the Rain for the first time ever this afternoon and I think I'm in love. Oh Gene Kelly!.. *What* I would give to have you flash those pearly whites at me! The story is really just a musical about a musical, going into various dream-like sequences embodied in the twelve minute ""Broadway Ballet"". The songs are cleverly intertwined with the acting so there's none of that phoniness one is used to seeing in some musical pictures. To watch the choreography is to watch pure genius. Gene Kelly is so talented it should be outlawed. (It's downright sacrilegious he wasn't nominated for the Academy Award®!)  I mean - DAMN! I kept backing up to the 'Singin' in the Rain' part seventy-five times in a row...it fills me with such a sense of joy! My Gramps once broke his ankle trying to imitate ol' Gene.The supporting cast is perfect as well, you really must hand it to Debbie Reynolds! She wasn't a trained dancer up until this point. They made her rehearse eight hours a day, hiring different dance instructors to work with the young actress in shifts. The stress proved so overwhelming she eventually had a breakdown and caught the attention of neighboring Fred Astaire who asked, ""Why are you crying?"" Not able to recognize the man through her tears, Reynolds confessed she felt hopeless and would never meet Kelly's standards. Astaire led her to another rehearsal room where he was busy working on Royal Wedding. ""You come watch me,"" he said. ""You watch how hard I work. I don't cry, but I do get frustrated and upset and I'm going to let you watch."" The experience showed her how a legendary performer like Astaire, known for his elegant moves on the dance floor, can even feel daunted : )Finally, what else can I say (other than Cyd Charisse wears the hottest dress I've ever seen)? This is one of THE greatest films of any genre ever! They just don't make 'em like this anymore.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Technical Comments,"Wonderful wonderful movie! I love this movie as seeing it is a musical. The excellent and superb camera and lighting effects, as well as the constant activity leave you scarce any time to be bored. The lighting of the screen as well as the voices of the actors give it a ""vaudville"" taste. It tells of the silent movie era and the transition to ""talkies"" (as mentioned) along with the Lina Lamont and Don Lockwood duo. Wonderful choreography, as seeing the two dancers match up just perfectly in step. I imagine it must have taken a long time to learn, practice, develop and film the steps perfectly. It is chock-full of wonderful music, dancing and singing. What's more, the songs sang by the actors reoccur frequently during the movie, which reminds you of the scene it was last sang in. Which is a refresher, and the closing is a wonderful aspect of humanity. I love it!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Easily the finest movie musical of all time,"For sheer enjoyment, no movie ever made beats Singin' in the Rain.  Donald O'Connor and Gene Kelly remind us why vaudeville was as popular as it was in the 20s, Debbie Reynolds lights up the screen, and Jean Hagen gives the performance of her career-of anybody's career for that matter.  If the title dance sequence doesn't get you moving, then there's no hope for you. There are only two down spots, ""Beautiful Girl"" and the never-ending ""Broadway Melody"" dance sequence (but the latter is worth it just to see Cyd Charisse).  The rest of the movie is flawless.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the Best,"SINGIN' IN THE RAIN's story is well known, and concerns 1920s silent romantic acting team Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen.) Trouble is that sound is coming in--and Lina's speaking voice could peel paint off the wall. The solution? Don's best friend (Donald O'Connor) and love interest (Debbie Reynolds) have the inspiration of revamping Lockwood and Lamont's debut sound film as a musical, with Reynolds dubbing Hagen's vocals. The resulting story is a high-energy, extremely witty, and truly sparkling film laced with period songs by Arthur Freed, a film that many regard as the single finest musical to emerge from Hollywood.In many respects SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is a throwback to the early musicals of the era it satirizes, for many of its musical numbers ('Make 'em Laugh' is a notable example) have absolutely nothing to do with the story it tells--but unlike such early musicals the storyline is exceptionally strong, and since the film is about the creation of an early ""all talking, all dancing, all singing"" movie in which such musical numbers were typical, they have here a certain validity that could not otherwise be achieved.The cast is absolutely flawless, and without exception Kelly, Reynolds, O'Connor, and Hagen (particularly memorable as the literally unspeakable silent star) give the finest performances of their respective careers. The musical numbers range from the vibrant and complex 'Good Morning' to the lyrical 'You Are My Lucky Star' to the brilliantly conceived and executed title song, each without exception the definition of perfection. The art designs are meticulous, beautiful, and recreate the late-silent and early-sound era of Hollywood with considerable wit and charm. As a whole, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN possesses an energy and vitality that simply makes you bounce in your seat from excitement.SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is a musical that even people who hate musicals love. Whether or not you consider it ""the"" finest musical ever created by Hollywood is, ultimately, a matter of personal preference; there are several contenders for that title, most notably MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS, GIGI, and THE WIZARD OF OZ. But no matter where you personally rank it, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is certainly ONE of the best, a film that simply gains in critical and popular stature with every passing year, a national and a world treasure of cinematic art.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Collection: Musicals (3/6),"After a trip to Europe, now it's a return to America and the cradle of filmmaking: Hollywood. Usually, I'am not fond of this kind of story (a movie about movies, a TV show about TV, a book about an author) because it's a blow to imagination. Instead of creativity, originality, the camera shoots what happens in front of it so it's not very interesting.Except this movie shows a pivotal moment in the golden age of Hollywood, when sound appears with the pictures so mute movies turn into ""talkies"". I am surprised that the first reactions were to despise this technology and above all that mute ""stars"" could have such silly voices or unable to act. The premiere of this new kind of movie is really funny.Another good thing about this movie is that all the songs have subtitles. But, the best thing remains Gene Kelly. Change him for another actor and the magic is gone. It's true that is an affirmation of life because we can share a glorious feeling in the rain whereas it's usually a unhappy moment to be under.In memoriam of my grandmother (1911-2010) who died this day of watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's The Cat's Meow!,"""Singin' In The Rain"" is a musical for people who don't like musicals. Fast, funny, self-aware, and chock full of the best singing and dancing you can cram into 105 minutes, it might as well be the best movie musical since the entire genre peaked here, never to be effectively revived.Fittingly, the movie focuses on the birth of the Hollywood musical. It's 1927, and the silent-film romantic pair of Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) find themselves suddenly wired for sound after ""The Jazz Singer"" inaugurates a new era. While there are a lot of problems for the pair to overcome, including the fact he hates her for the nasty witch she is, the only real problem is that Lina's Godzilla-like ego comes with a Godzilla-like voice. Making their new movie into a musical might then seem a bad idea, except that Don's new girl Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) can sing like a dream, and doesn't mind dubbing Lina.Knowing humor abounds in this classic, clever film. ""You have to show a movie at a party. It's a Hollywood law,"" says Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor), Lockwood's buddy. An opening sequence features a Hedda Hopper announcer introducing vogue-ing celebrities at a red-carpet premiere. ""They've been married two months now, and happy as newlyweds,"" she coos as a catatonic couple stroll past.Even the musical numbers are done with a wink, like ""Beautiful Girl"" and ""All I Do Is Dream Of You."" This would be a great film even if the most famous of those numbers, Kelly's ""Singin' In The Rain,"" was left on the cutting-room floor. There's still ""Make 'Em Laugh,"" the funniest song-and-dance routine ever done (by O'Connor and a mannequin) and ""Good Morning,"" with some of the most intricate tap dancing ever performed times three.But ""Singin' In The Rain"" IS there, and it fully deserves its place in the pantheon, not only with Kelly's wonderfully irrational exuberance but some incredible camera work that pans over and around him to maximize the uplift in this goose-pimple number.If only they left out (and not just trimmed) that Broadway musical number near the end, the pseudo-ballet with Cyd Charisse. It pulls us away from the story for 20 minutes, apparently so Kelly could have a section with his favorite dance partner. No one ever looked better on the big screen, or projected such natural-seeming charisma, as Genial Gene, but apparently he could throw his elbows with the best of them. It's obvious how much this film owes to the other director, the playful and creative Stanley Donan. If Kelly stuck to the on screen stuff, this would have been a better film.But what am I talking about? It's ""Singin' In The Rain""! I can't dock this simply because Kelly had a big ego. He earned it with this great film, a movie milestone. If you never see another movie musical, see this one. You'll be glad you did.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
An enduring and memorable movie musical.,"'Singin' In The Rain (1952)' is one of the most memorable and enduring movie musicals of all time, remaining a classic even after all these years. It is also, despite my well-documented reservations with the genre, one of the best of its kind, especially when it comes to handling its sing-song scenes. All of its song-and-dance numbers are diegetic, or otherwise make total narrative sense, and only a couple seem to slightly break from the presented world-space, with the occasional abandonment of actual scenes to long tap routines feeling like there'd be at least some objection from those being fobbed off in favour of dance - or those wandering why on earth the characters are dancing like madmen at these occasionally inappropriate times - and the players sometimes making eyes at the 'camera' as opposed to anyone within their vicinity. There's also one number in which three people simultaneously know choreography to a dance they're making up on the spot, though this isn't a massive issue as they're all professional dancers and doing fairly standard tap for most of the piece - plus, the song in question is pre-existing and so the dance could be inspired by it. Indeed, only two songs were actually written for this flick, despite the fact that most have become synonymous with it. Even the title song was already around, which has certainly been tied to its segment in the film but is actually supposedly the inspiration for the entire picture (somehow). What's most striking about the flick, for me, is its story. Sure, the musical aspects are wonderfully done and certainly some of the best of their kind. I can't express how impressed I was when Donald O'Connor ran up a straight wall and back-flipped off it. Sometimes, these dance-numbers go on for too long, though, especially towards the latter half once the choreography starts to repeat. They actually begin to detract from the narrative slightly. While the 'Broadway Ballet' sequence is a visual treat and a remarkable achievement, it is totally superfluous and kills the pacing. It takes away from the most important aspect, which is - and always should be - the story. Still, we're back on track before long. The tale is an interesting and rather well-told one, despite some unfortunate signs of its age. The silent star pulled into the sound era has been used in a number of films since this, though this puts its focus more on creating the first movie musical and therefore becomes a slightly meta experience. It is also nicely satirical, too, a self-aware look at cinema history seen from fairly fresh eyes (the fifties weren't far off from the late twenties, after all). It's this light-tone and moments of genuine humour that keep the piece afloat, with an endearing cast caught in an entertaining quest to keep their careers afloat. It's an enjoyable experience that provides all the spectacle you'd expect but does sometimes get a little too caught up in it. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
This movie certainly didn't appeal to me,"Well, I have to be one of those people who simply HATED this musical and really cannot see all the fuss over it, or ever why people think it should have won the Oscar for best picture of that year. Although it had some catchy tunes, and I guess the dancing was fine, it really didn't grab me. The plot was nearly non-existent. I put it up there with ""Easter Parade"", ""Bandwagon"", and ""Finian's Rainbow"" as the most boring musicals. Even though all of them have some wonderful tunes, none of them really do anything. Though I fully understood the weak excuse of a plot dealing with the transition from Vaudville, silent movies, then to talkies, I found that the actual plot was so thin it left me wanting, and it became nothing more than an excuse on which to hang some songs (albeit some really catchy and lively ones).Sadly, I find that to be the trouble with most Movie musicals. There are no characters that develop at all. However, there are some that have really grabbed me: ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"", ""Meet me in Saint Louis"" (and yes, it hasn't got a strong plot either, but it hangs together far better than ""Singing in the Rain"")""Brigadoon"", ""Showboat"",""Wizard of Oz"", and a few like that. My favourite musical is ""Fiddler on the Roof."" Why it appeals to me is there is a real plot, and the music is not intrusive and doesn't stop the actual storyline. That is my biggest complaint with musicals is the way everything comes to a stop for the music (""Oliver"" is one of the worst for this), and that usually the plot is so weak that well, were it not for the music there would be nothing whatever to watch.Each performer did a masterful job in this movie, that I can admit. The choreography was well thought out (especially anything that Gene Kelly danced, but of course, he did the choreography, so naturally what he designed for himself would be masterful). Even the singing was quite good (though I prefer more robust singing over Kelly's soft breathy crooning). And of course, the sets, costumes, and all that were wonderful. And the editing was well done.But even with all that going for it, it just left me cold and for the most part, bored. The only Movie Musical that bored me more was ""Westside Story."" And again, it is a musical with some really great music, just far too long.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Trot Out the Accolades--It's Unparalleled,"This is my favorite movie musical with no stage forebear.Consider what's in the mix: A cachet of songs, all tried-and-true from other movies. A cast that was at the top of its form, all the way from Kelly himself to the supporting leads played by Rita Moreno and Millard Mitchell. A script that is, at once, romantic and exciting and sharp and funny.Stir together with a generous heaping of MGM color and a dash of a director with a stellar pedigree and the result is, well, something like ""Singin' in the Rain.""There's not a misstep in the movie's entire 103-minute running time. I love the pokes at early filmmaking (""She never *did* figure out where that microphone was, boss!"") and the sheer energy of the musical numbers (""Fit as a Fiddle,"" ""Good Mornin'"").Not only that, but there's not a more romantic scene in all of filmdom that can compare with Reynolds and Kelly dancing to ""You Were Meant for Me."" Their side-by-side tap dancing says more about how they feel about each other than pages and pages of dialog.Great stuff!If you think this movie is just the sequence of Kelly splashing like a five-year-old in a puddle, you obviously haven't seen the entire film. Do so--now! You won't regret it!PS: In the ""rent-this-too"" category, if you've seen and love ""Singin' in the Rain,"" check out ""The Band Wagon."" It skewers the world of theater in much the same way as this film roasts Hollywood!",,Anonymous,Romance
How do you review a movie that's quite literally off the charts?,"To be successful, a musical needs to have good musical numbers well performed. This movie has that, often in spades.In addition, it has one of the cleverest, most brilliant scripts ever written for a Hollywood movie, musical or otherwise, and directors who know how to realize it to its fullest potential.And two male stars that are, themselves, so far off the charts that we're lucky if we can appreciate at least part of their astounding talent. Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor dance as well as any dancers have ever danced on film, and play off each other like the best of vaudeville teams. Debby Reynolds certainly holds up her end, but it's Kelly and O'Connor, and the directing of Kelly and Donan, that transform what would have been a first-rate musical into what is, indeed, probably the best musical ever made.Watch it once. Watch it multiple times. Each time you will marvel more at its brilliance.What a picture!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best of these romance dance and song films--AMAZING,"Singin' in the Rain (1952)You gotta love a movie like this.But--how in the world do you talk about a classic that has grown so big it defines its own genre? How can you mention, politely, that it's filled with flaws?If there are parts that are frankly corny, to the point of being ""stupid"" if they appeared in some other movie, can you say so? (The first big opening night scenes where people are getting out of their cars might be one.)If some of the dance scenes seem like throw-ins, adding nothing to the plot and offering only more lighthearted tap dancing and goofing around, isn't this a distraction? (The diction coach dance is one candidate.)What if it's just full of itself? (The Cyd Charisse ballet scenes can be seen that way, for sure.) Or what if the plot is just too obviously a vehicle, and we can't get involved like we should in something more sincere, or more surprising? (The guy lands in the seat of a moving car and finds himself next to the girl, hello?)Well, the answer to all these is you need to chill and lighten up and realize that that's how these musicals go. It's like you had Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds over to your house and everyone started hamming it up and dancing and being silly. And Donald O'Connor stopped by to play piano (and dance up the walls). And you blow it up and give it dazzling color and bright lights. Then rehearse a little so the dance steps aren't just fun, but they are astonishing, and choreographed exquisitely? And what if you, say, want to have a little history of dance thrown in, why not? And of course modern ballet is the counterpart to modern Hollywood musical dance numbers, so why not try to mix them a bit (this is Gene Kelly's doing, mostly)?So if you ramp up the affair into a big budget, slickly filmed movie, but never lose sight of its origins as a kind of fun, not-so-serious romp, it's just a great time.

"As long as Anne Marie is no where about, you'll enjoy this lovely film.","Tonight was my second time watching ""Singing in the Rain"" and I am actually surprised that I ever saw it again. Now it is not because it's a bad film--it just holds an annoying memory. You see, when I saw the film, an annoying person named Anne Marie was also watching it....and yelled out what would happen in the finale BEFORE it happened. So, after years of therapy, I have finally decided to watch this again. And, in light of the annoying Anne Marie, I WON'T spoil the film by announcing spoilers in my review!""Singing in the Rain"" is set at the time period in which silent pictures were being replaced with sound (about 1927). Gene Kelly and Jean Hagen play two established stars who are beloved by the public. Sound isn't a bad thing for Gene, as he can sing and dance. But Jean, uggh, she has a voice like a Brooklyn parrot and her career is doomed (and she great in this role). That is, until they get the idea of dubbing her with sweet Debbie Reynolds. But as the film progresses, it becomes obvious that Jean is a devil and Debbie is amazing--and Gene is head over heels for her. What's to become of them?The film does something interesting for a musical. Almost all the music is actually recycled from earlier MGM musicals (often from this late 20s time period). While this might seem cheesy, it worked very well because the songs were period and because the production values (the dancing, Technicolor and singing) were so nice it really breathed life into them. In fact, several of the musical numbers are among the best ever filmed--such as ""Singing in the Rain"" and ""Make 'em Laugh"". Unfortunately, and I know this will sound like sacrilege, but I think the film had too many numbers, as some of the more garish dance numbers (""Gotta Dance"") detracted from those that were sublime. Still, it has a very, very memorable score, a lot of energy and fun make this a musical to watch...provided Anne Marie is no where in sight. I wonder what ever became of her....perhaps some other film viewers killed her (we can only hope).",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Why it's the best,"There are two kinds of musicals. You can call them different things. You could call them the Hollywood Musical and the Broadway Musical. That's not quite proper because the Hollywood Musical is what the Broadway Musical was in the 20's and 30's, before Rogers and Hammerstein changed everything. maybe a better distinction is the Dancing Musical vs. the Singing Musical, except that both kinds have dancing and singing...Let's try it this way. The original musicals on Broadway in the 20's and 30's and Hollywood in the 30's and 40's were musicals with a slight storyline, some singing and tremendous dancing numbers. They also have low comedy and plenty of beautiful girls. They usually are about show business itself and many of the numbers take place on the stage. the others seem like the likely result of bringing show people together: of course they are going to sing and dance from time to time. Looking at them these days, the singing is kind of boring, the comics dreadful and the plots the answer to a moron's prayer. It's the dance numbers that are timeless. These films were made for highlight reels like ""That's Entertainment"".Rogers and Hammerstein changed all that. They took serious plays and converted them into operetta of popular music. Characters who were not in show business at all used songs and dances as soliloquies to reveal their private thoughts. The result was some of the best plays and films of all time- Oklahoma, Carousel, The King and I, South Pacific, The Sound of Music, Brigadoon, Gigi, My Fair Lady, The Music Man, etc. South Pacific was the first film my parent sever took me to see and this is the type of musical I normally prefer. Here songs tended to dominate- ""Surrey with the Fringe on Top, ""Out of My Dreams"", ""People Will Say We're in Love, ""If I Loved You"", ""My Boy Bill"", ""I Have Dreamed"", ""Hello Young Lovers"", ""Some Enchanted Evening"", ""Younger Than Springtime"", etc. ,etc. There are dance pieces but the dancers are on the sidelines.""Singing in the Rain"" is the greatest of all the Hollywood Musicals. It has the memorable dances a Hollywood Musical needs: ""Make 'Em Laugh"", Singing in the Rain"", ""Good Morning"", ""Broadway Melody"". There is also the best of the Freed-Brown songbook, such as ""You are My Lucky Star"". But it has the strongest story of any of the Hollywood Musicals, thanks to the Comden-Green team and the memories of the early days of sound. it's virtually the only Hollywood Musical that could have held up as a non-musical. It could have just been a comedy about he conversion to sound. it would not have been ""Singing in the Rain"", but it would have been good.As it is, it's the one musical that has it all.",,Anonymous,Romance
"It's the vitality of its parts, as well as of the whole, that does it","That ""Singin' in the Rain"" is a great film you can learn from more erudite and closely argued reviews than mine (and from more enthusiastic reviews, too, although I love the film as much as anyone and could be just as enthusiastic if I chose).I'd just like to mention one thing: the films within the film. Donen and Kelly deserve especial credit for not slacking off here. The swashbuckling silent picture that introduces us to Lockwood and Lamont actually comes across as a well-made crowd-pleaser (it is admittedly more compressed than a real film of the era would have been, but we can forgive the compression), and since Gene Kelly isn't afraid to give Lockwood his own charm, energy and physical skill, it's no strain at all to believe that he's a popular actor, or that the film could be a box-office success. (I wouldn't mind seeing it myself.) And the first and last sound Lockwood-and-Lamont vehicle is equally persuasive (in its earlier incarnation as a dire piece of petrified staginess AND later, when it's a perfectly decent early stab at a screen musical).Kelly claims that the ""Broadway Melody"" section grew and grew from a tiny diversion to a huge, long, lavish diversion; and this, too, tells us something: that side references of this kind, to projects which the various characters happen to be or have been working on, have a life of their own, which means that the projects themselves have a life of their own. This is a GOOD thing. The musical numbers that are part of the story fit the story perfectly well, and as everyone knows the title song could not be a more natural or apt expression of Lockwood's feelings than it is in context. The musical numbers that are NOT part of the story are bound by no such rules of integration. Nor should they be.The final film-within-the-film  Lockwood and Selden's first project together, the film they're looking at a billboard advertisement for in the final shot  is also entitled ""Singin' in the Rain"". Some people think that the film they make is more or less the film we see. But of course it isn't. ""Singin' in the Rain""  neither the film we see, nor any film that Lockwood and Selden would have made together  is not some exercise in twee, unimaginative, academic self-reference. These people have talent. It's clear from the other samples of their craft that they're capable of CREATING stuff (in fact, they could scarcely prevent themselves from doing so), and they don't need to bottle their own autobiographies and pass it off as art. If you want some clue as to what the film-within-a-film version of ""Singin' in the Rain"" is like, look to the opening credits, in which we see Kelly, O'Connor and Reynolds singing in the rain together. I believe that this is a conceptual sketch (just as the version of ""Broadway Melody"" we see is a conceptual sketch) of the musical number as it will appear in Lockwood and Selden's film.

Everything is as it should be: the cast, the music, the lyrics, the dancing, the script and plot... the last is most significant, since with musicals (and movie musicals in particular), you always get the sense that the plot has been skimped on--compromised for the songs that the writer wants to feature in the film. In this film, however, all the songs are part of a whole, and the whole works beautifully.If you watch one movie musical in your whole life, make it 'Singin' In The Rain'. Join Gene Kelly as he dances and whirls through the rain and straight into Kathy's (and the audience's) heart. A classic for the ages.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
truly terrific,"""Singin' in the Rain"" is rightly regarded as one of the most fondly regarded musicals of Hollywood's golden age.  Not only does it contain four superb performances (Gene Kelly as vain silent screen idol Don Lockwood, painfully making the transition to sound; Debbie Reynolds as Cathy Selden, a chorus girl who wants to be a great actress; Donald O'Connor as Cosmo Brown, the dependable friend who puts fun into the movie; and Jean Hagen as the screechy Lina Lamont, Don's erstwhile co-star) but is an affectionate tribute to the birth of the talkies.The best scene of all is of course, Gene's dance down a rain-sodden street, much anthologised and by far the most technically accomplished and totally joyous piece of musical cinema.  I also have to mention the Broadway Melody sequence, featuring the great Cyd Charisse - perfection itself.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Bravo, Bravo!","I love this movie!!!  While the music definitely has a 1950s sound to it, it also somehow fits the 1920s, which is what it is portraying.  My favorite song from Singin' in the Rain is ""Good Morning.""  I love ""Good Morning,"" because it doesn't really make much sense, yet it fits perfectly in the time it is sung (1:30 am).  No one really makes much sense at 1:30 in the morning if they have been up all day.The casting and direction were done superbly.  Gene Kelly is not only good looking, but he also can dance, sing, and act like it is going out of style. He is wonderful in every movie I have seen him in, & I must admit that he is one of my favorite actors of all time!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
dancing that gives you the chills,"Singin' In The Rain quite possibly one of the best movie musicals of all time. The dancing is unforgettable and fantastic, mesmerizing the audience until the credits are done.  Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor are perfect in their roles.  Kelly plays Don Lockwood, a cocky and handsome superstar in the 1920s who just made a bad talking movie with his romantic leading lady, Lena Lamont (Jean Hagen).  Donald O'Connor's character, Cosmo Brown, is the absolutely hilarious best friend of Lockwood, who sings his famous ""Make 'Em Laugh"" number and cracks jokes from beginning to end.  Kathy Seldon (Debbie Reynolds) enters the plot as Lockwood's love interest and Lena Lamont gets jealous.  ""Moses Supposes"", ""Singin' In The Rain"" and ""Broadway Melody"" are fantastic and classic numbers that will make you want to become a dancer yourself! Each time I watch this film, it gets better and better.  I can never get sick of it. ***1/2 out of ****",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The greatest musical of them all,"The biggest numbers, the greatest stars, the snappiest dialog, and a story worth telling... Sure the lengthy ""Broadway Melody"" ballet at the end drags things for the non-dance fan, but even it is a superior effort to other attempts at a jazz ballet, say, American in Paris.  From ""Fit as a Fiddle"" to ""Lucky Star"" the numbers sizzle.  If you single out the title tune and Kelly's wonderful dance, you can't forget the outrageous O'Connor's ""Be a Clown"" or either of the male leads comedy duets.  Words fail me.  See the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The best musical I've ever seen,"I never thought I'd write a review for a musical since usually I am annoyed by the long, poor-made singing scenes, especially in Bollywood movies.
But I could never say that about this one, there is no way a single scene from this masterpiece could be annoying or anything close to that, it's just full of joyful scenes, all the dance scenes are catchy and well, anyone could admit that you don't see these things done anymore... at least not as much as they were done before.
I'm a '98 kid so I can only guess what it felt like for that generation back then to make this movie and to be a part of that scene of musicals and lifestyle in general and most important what it feels like for them watching this movie now.
It's one of the rare gems of television and I am so glad that I saw it and that many people still watch it today, it's like the most lively and charming history lesson about musicals.P.S.: I don't usually rate movies, but I thought I'd just do it now so it boosts it's general rating a bit, even in the slightest.

Singin' In the Rain (1952),"I'm not usually one for musicals, but this film was actually pretty enjoyable. The story was interesting and making it about the change from silent to talking films was a good subject. It not only showed how people felt about it, but what it also meant for the actors/actress' and the movie business at the time. This was the perfect subject for the film as in this film they also show just how far sound and color have come from the age that is portrayed, putting on elaborate and colorful singing and dancing routines. Some of the routines did get a little carried away at times, but overall they weren't too frequent or overbearing and there was a pretty good balance of musical and story.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The most over-rated film ever? Pure contrived advertising and product placement,"This is the most disappointing film I have ever seen.It is certainly not the worst film, but I had such high expectations because of the cast and how famous the movie is.However, as a movie, it is contrived, banal, uninteresting, uninspiring and unbelievable. In fact, none of the movie made sense at all until I watched the special features that contained interviews with some of those originally associated with the movie.Then it all became clear: One interviewee pointed out that the film was created purely as a vehicle to string some promising songs together, as well as to try and recycle a couple of duds that had bombed in the hope they would be better received on this outing.And that is exactly what the movie looks like - a disjointed collection of 'music videos' strung together into a contrived story.Lots of other movies or stage shows have taken the same tack, such as the Abba musical Mama Mia. And while they may be harmless fun, they would not qualify as 'great' musicals in the way that the truly great musicals can - where music and story are brilliantly woven together into a beautiful fabric that is better than either the story or the music could be on its own.It has some merit as an example of an early advertising vehicle, where the threat posed by product pitches in distorting and destroying art was not yet fully understood. But any reasonably critical view of this film at that time should have stopped this poor film and that tragic trend in their tracks.As it turned out, audiences were prepared to accept and even celebrate the mediocre in order to fawn over favorite celebrities. And that wide embrace of shameless-advertising-as-art and celebrity over quality would prove over subsequent decades to be the dominant trend.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's not called the greatest musical of all time for nothing.,"Although it was somewhat overshadowed by An American in Paris in it's time, it is now justifiably considered one of the best Hollywood musicals ever made. It's my favorite musical, Gene Kelly film, and one of my favorite MOVIES.Kelly was without a doubt at the peak of his amazing career as an actor, director, choreographer, and above all dancer. Each scene is dripping with bright, vibrant colors and plenty of laughs. Kelly's class and charm just exudes from the screen.What makes the film so extraordinary is the way each song and dance number flow effortlessly and are perfectly intergrated into the story. These numbers not only showcase the amazing ability of Kelly, Donald O'Connor, and even Debbie Reynolds, but also the exuberance of that happy and carefree feeling of the 1920's.Some of the standout numbers are of course the title dance through the rain, and Broadway Melody, but also the hilarious ""Make Em Laugh"" where O'Connor displays his talent of blending humor and acrebatic movements, and ""Good Morning"" where Reynolds holds her own between the  2 greatest dancers of the time.This film is an American classic and an absolute must see. It's the perfect movie to watch if you want to laugh, smile, or just simply watch something that leaves you with a good feeling. I know I am always left with a glorious feeling in my heart.",,Anonymous,Romance

"""Hey Joe, bring me a tarantula!""","My grandfather used to chuckle as he recalled seeing 'The Great Gabbo' with sound out of sync, which proves the veracity of the technical problems depicted in this masterpiece whose failure to win a single Oscar further undermines what little credibility the Academy Awards has ever possessed.Debbie Reynolds said the experience was one of the two hardest things she ever had to endure (giving birth to Carrie Fisher was the other), and both she and Donald O'Connor found Gene Kelly demanding and tyrannical to work for; while Kelly himself later declared that he had seen himself performing the title number - running a high temperature and soaked to the skin on a soundstage that stank because milk had been added to the rain in order for it to photograph - so many times it was impossible for him to derive any pleasure from it anymore.But posterity has had the last laugh, since a full seventy years later the film continues to give pleasure.

Quick Review,"""Singin in the Rain"" is a classic Hollywood Picture being both an omage to (the even more) classic Hollywood and a satire of it!Is one of musical's best, but even though some of the songs have stood the test of time, the overall tone might be a bit slow or unpaced for some.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Snippets of fond musical moments,"""Singin' in the Rain"" is like a theatrical necklace, strung together with gems in the form of musical numbers and then crowned with a sparkling diamond in the middle: the unforgettably classic title track. The running thread in between them might be a little weak, but it's the jewels that that win out in the end.Each musical number carries its own unique magnitude, breathing life, emotion, charm and romance into a lackluster plot. The story is about what happens when the motion picture business in the '20s develops the first talking picture (the appropriately referenced ""The Jazz Singer"" starring Al Jolson) and how it affects two of the business' biggest stars: Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen)...and of course their quirky piano player Cosmo (played by physical humor extroadinaire Donald O'Connor). Underlying it all is Lockwood's love for a wannabe actress Kathy Selden played by Debbie Reynolds, a relationship built on one of the more preposterous Hollywood fantasies.Because of the plot's unoriginality and the sometimes lengthy tangents the songs take you on, ""Singin' in the Rain"" is enjoyed by the scene. As a viewer, you pick your favorites and pay more attention to them, dismissing those that bore. O'Connor's humorous turn in ""Make 'Em Laugh"" is a surefire favorite as is ""Moses (Supposes)"" and of course ""Singin' in the Rain."" The choreography and the non-stop energy in these numbers makes them so fun and easy to watch. Other scenes like ""Broadway Rhythm Ballet"" fit the tastes of the dancing connoisseurs as Cyd Charisse steals you away from the film for a good 15 minutes with her incredible shape and grace.There's also a good amount of gags and slapstick filler between numbers, but the numbers are what make ""Singin' in the Rain"" stand out. The title number is about the only one that perfectly accompanies the storyline. Don is so head over heels for Kathy that he could sing and dance carelessly out in the pouring rain. That's what makes the scene stick out as classic: most of the other numbers are not extensions of the storyline, they're detours from it, but ""Singin' in the Rain"" endures on this glorious number.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

When Hollywood Was Great - Early Last Century,"This first time I saw this film was sometime in the 70s. I was a teenager and saw it in a theatre that 'specialized' in oldies.

Hubby and I decided to watch something uplifting, romantic and fun. So of course that meant practically nothing done since the 80s. We decided this and what a great choice.

Singin' in the Rain,"Musician Don Lockwood (Kelly) rises to stardom during Hollywood's silent-movie era--paired with the jealous beautiful air headed and squeaky-voiced Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen). When Lockwood becomes attracted to young studio singer Kathy Selden (Reynolds), Lamont has her fired. But with the introduction of talking pictures, audiences laugh when they hear Lamont speak for the first time--and the studio uses Selden to dub her voice.An affectionate, tuneful and exuberant as well as satirical look at Hollywood in the roaring '20s when the movie capital wrestled with the problem of turning silents into talkies. It's fun all the way with Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds and Donald O' Connor playing their parts well; Gene Kelly is on top form, his physicality oozes class when he dances. Check out the long segment with Cyd Charise and of course, the classic 'Singin' in the Rain' number, where Gene dances in the rain, and was sent-up years later in the Morecambe and Wise show. It's a solid, feel good musical that has other memorable numbers such as ""Make 'Em Laugh"", ""You Are My Lucky Star"".",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Back When Sweat Was Involved,"I had put off seeing this movie because of the tremendous amount of build-up it has associated with it.  ""The Best Movie Musical of All Time"" is a large title to uphold and...well...it just couldn't do it.  Now, before I get pummelled with rotten tomatoes, I'd like to point out the things I really liked about the film.First, and foremost, watching Gene Kelly dance was very entertaining.  He really made it look effortless, and it was so delightful to see a man of his build and facial expressions doing the kind of dancing he was doing.  One just doesn't get the opportunity to see that in film anymore, and I think it would still be received appreciatively today.Jean Hagen's performance was hilarious.  She was very believable and no ""dumb blonde"" either (well, of course she was!).  To me she was the true scene stealer who gave a timeless comedic performance that will continue to be revered.I think one of the reasons this movie will not be timeless as a whole, however, is because of the Donald O'Connor character.  There is no doubt this man was a product of a time when Hollywood actors had to work extremely hard to earn their money (I'm thinking of his dancing solo where he defies gravity) but there is an element to his performance that screams ""I'M TRYING TOO HARD TO ENTERTAIN YOU"" and it is hard to ignore.    I found it to be really annoying, particularly in the ""Good Morning"" segment, which in and of itself, was a terribly silly concept and situation.  Not a funny silly either--more of a preposterous silly.I don't think a film like this could be redone, and I don't think it is supposed to be.  It is just one of those films you are supposed to see because it represents a certain time in American film history, and it can be appreciated for some of the things it is missing.  Hard work was definitely not one of them.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Dull, unfunny, and over-rated.","Don't bother to try to change my opinion, I just don't like this movie.

It's obscene and insulting.  This is no classic movie.  This is just a stage musical in front of a camera.  And why is that one dance number near the end so interminably long?Musicals and non-musicals should be kept separate from each other, as documentaries are not put in the same category with fictional or ""depicted non-fiction"" movies.

What a Glorious Feeling ..,"And what a glorious film ... #5 film in AFI's Top 100 movies, #1 musical, #16 romance and #16 comedy, ""Singin in the Rain"" doesn't celebrate Hollywood, it defines it through a range of emotions, so rich that you can't finish this timeless classic without shouting : ""Now, that's entertainment!""If there is ever a movie for which the word iconic takes its full meaning, ""Singin' in the Rain"" takes the cake, and an appetizing one where you can expect the beautiful Debbie Reynolds jumping out of it. With Donald O'Connor and Gene Kelly, she forms the so lovable trio that sets the cheerful mood in the opening sequence : holding their umbrellas, wearing raincoats, they enthusiastically walk and express their joy to be simply 'singin in the rain'. Indeed, the title itself, beyond its reference to the most memorable song, embodies the film's main feeling, something so positive it's impossible to write a review without using up all the synonyms of 'happiness'.""Singin' in the Rain"" incarnates a quite hedonistic philosophy of life, inspiring the most positive emotions even when the natural elements don't help. While many people try to run for a dry spot, afraid to get wet and catch a cold, Gene Kelly's let himself getting rain soaked while his heart is basking under sunshine of love. He savors the moment with a total carelessness, inviting the rain to come at him. This part doesn't only work because of the communicative aspect of the 'glorious' feeling, but also as an incredibly inspirational moment in its sheer simplicity. The image of Kelly swinging on the lamppost, is the eternal allegory of happiness that only Cinema could have illustrated, a happiness going through every possible stage, delight, pleasure, enchantment until it becomes a totally jubilant moment where Kelly literally splashes on a ocean of joy, until he faces a cop, whose presence puts an end to this orgasmic mayhem, and the melody can finally end  leaving us with these immortal lines ""I'm dancing and singing in the rain""This is one of these magical sequences that immediately penetrated people's hearts and, once and for all, our universal heritage. No one can imagine this film without immediately thinking of the rain, the lamppost and Gene Kelly's illuminating smile. I can't evoke the film, I can't watch it or live it without it bringing me back to my childhood memories. I discovered the song through one of its countless parodies, and it stuck in my mind right away. Once, my dad saw a documentary about the film and immediately called me to see if I that sequence rang a bell. Another day, still as a child, I saw a documentary about Hollywood MGM Golden Age, only waiting for the 'Singin' in the Rain' part  and when I got to see the film, I finally surprised myself by enjoying the comedy more than the musical, and ""Make 'em laugh"" by Donald O'Connor, became my favorite part.""Make' em Laugh"" is another amazing achievement that works alone as an efficient antidepressant. Donald O'Connor accomplishes an impressive acrobatic number, extending his comedic performance to every single element of slapstick, with a natural goofiness and perfect timing that makes it look like a spontaneous act of virtuosity and makes you forget about the rehearsal this would have probably taken : you just open your eyes, and admire the performance. He laughs, smiles, makes funny faces, gravity-defying moves with one motto, no ... not ""dignity, dignity"" but on the contrary trading any sense of dignity in order to make the other laugh, or giggle, or smile or at least feel good. O'Connor is the perfect clown without any ounce of sadness, the scene-stealing comic relief of a rather hilarious comedy!The movie doesn't disobey the implicit golden rule that there's no better comedy than one with a heart, and the heart of the film belongs to the exquisite Debbie Reynolds, whose character has the merit of having 'inspired' the iconic rain sequence. She's extremely poignant in her lack of confidence and her will to help her friends that we automatically feel for her, as he would do to a Disney Princess. This analogy is not fortuitous and probably explains why I enjoyed the comedy more than the romance, the funny musical numbers more than the serious ones, the villain more than the princess. What a villain by the way, hard to imagine the film's success without the incredible Lina Lamont, played by Jean Hagen who provides perhaps more laughs than O'Connor in the comedy department, with her voice, speech mannerism and hilarious ""What am I dumb or something?"" catchphrase.My last comment didn't intend to diminish the merit of the romance but I don't really see it as the movie's highlight although it features many memorable scenes. When Kelly as Lockwood says to Lina : ""I don't like her half as I hate you"", I think he sums it up quite well, as many fans probably love the romance but not as much as they adore the comedy. And count me also among those who fail to see the relevancy of the whole 'Broadway Melody' sequence that kind of deviated from the intelligence of the plot and weakened its 'vis comica'. ""Singin' in the Rain"" had to keep on the clever homage to that crucial transition to talking pictures and self-reflexive celebration of the genre that consecrated the triumph of talking pictures, the genre that probably best incarnates the bright side of Hollywood : musicals. As flashy, flamboyant and enjoyable as it was, the scene could've been shorter, end up with a kind of punchline or at least respected the ""Make' em laugh!"" motto.I rated it a 9 because of the Broadway sequence, but the rest of the film deserves a 11 as one of the greatest comedies and the greatest musical ever, even better than ""Guys and Dolls"" put together.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Singin' In The Rain is pouring with whimsical musicality and soaking in silver screen magic.,"The musical genre is not my favourite. Not in the slightest. Taking a drama and having characters randomly burst into a musical number never really appealed to me. But here I am reviewing what is quite possibly the most famous 50s musicals to ever come out of Hollywood. And I'm going to start this review with a bold statement. I've had some time to contemplate and arrange my thoughts before confirming my opinion. Not only is this the best musical I have ever seen, but actually one of the best films these eyes have watched. Period. A stuntman turned actor finds love with a stage actress and must quickly adapt to the era of ""Talkies"", where dancing, singing and acting are consistently scrutinised.During the 40s and 50s, actors didn't have to just act. They had to perform energetic choreographed dance sequences whilst singing in tune. Multi-talented stars that put actors working today to shame. This musical takes the evolution of early cinema and uses it to depict a blossoming romance. From lessons in diction to gain the proper pronunciation for the sensitive microphones at the time, to the technical synchronisation of sound and picture. The film doesn't need to convey heavy themes or a tell a melodramatic story. The reason why it has become a timeless classic is because of its light-hearted wholesome magic that is purely made for cinema. The characters, including the bitter Lina, had infectious personalities that made them likeable. Kelly's Lockwood is as charming as ever and Reynolds' Selden (who was an absolute diamond) is magnificently developed. Every character was engaging, and that is primarily thanks to a well-rounded script that was surprisingly comedic. Several laughs came from visual humour, like being unable to capture an actor's voice as they talk away from a concealed microphone, however a large portion of smiles came from silly jokes (particularly from O'Connor's Cosmo). ""Remind me to give you a raise""...""Can I have a raise?"". Simplistic lines of dialogue like that really do age well.With a musical, it is imperative that the original songs that are performed are memorable. Well, Singin' In the Rain has some of the best. From the eponymous tune that sees Kelly joyfully dance through a rainy street, to songs like ""Good Morning"" and ""Broadway Melody"" that are still referenced today. Whilst the lyrics are catchy and easy to remember even after one watch, it's the choreographed dance sequences accompanying these that provide the core energy for this musical. Absolutely sensational. Kelly and O'Connor were spellbinding as they tap their way through various numbers and dance the Charleston til the sun comes out. Consistently inventive with each sequence being varyingly different. The dazzling frocks and stylish haircuts emulate the era it is portraying with accuracy, making every scene pleasant to watch. Donen and Kelly's directing techniques ensure that minimal cuts were injected within the musical numbers, resulting in several long takes that really draw you in.To be quite honest with you, I'm lost for words. Unlikely as that is, I am. Timeless classics like this is the reason why I love film. No matter the age and technological limitations, masterpieces can still be conceived. I truly believe Singin' In The Rain is just that, which is why it is getting the perfect rating. I didn't want it to end!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Amazing,"Singing in the Rain has got to be one of my favorite movies of all time. I'm 20 years old, and my mother raised me on the songs, but I had never seen the movie itself until I took a cinema class in college, and boy, was I missing out. The music and sound were incredible, as well as the tracking shots. It all has a kind of staged feel which I felt fit very well with the plot of the movie, since most of it DID take place on the stage. And, we have the introduction of dancing and musical numbers, which are always a great thing to throw in. Keeping in the trend of having the viewer feel like the people they are viewing, everything was lit very well, which is reminiscent of the stage lights that they had to stand under. Furthermore, the viewer is introduced to the type of problems that they might face if they were in show business during the transition from silent to sound: Worrying about one's voice, etc. I really think it's an incredible movie that doesn't get near enough attention.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

O'Connors steals the show!!,"I'm not a big fan of musical movies, in general, and this one is no exception. I only give the movie a 6 out of 10, because of Donald O'Connor's amazing dance and movement, and Debbie Reynold's innocence. The focus of my comments, however, goes to Mr. O'Connor. The fact that he spent 3 days in bed resting after ""Make 'em laugh"" shows how hard this man worked. It is one of the most brilliant pieces of solo physical comedy in any film.Donald O'Connor makes dancing look like walking, it's so natural for him. Gene Kelly dances like the egoist that he apparently was. I love the fluidity of O'Connor's movements, and the contrast is never so pronounced as when they are dancing the duet in the elocutionists office. O'Connor is fluid, whereas Kelly is clearly stiff and wooden and ""on"". This is what makes O'Connor, and Danny Kaye, so much more professional than the Kellys and the Astaires. They put their efforts into their work, not into their egos.I also can see where Chevy Chase snagged some of his aping techniques that he used so well when he mocked Jane Curtin behind her back on Weekend Update. O'Connor does the job here, behind the elocutionists back - what facial dexterity!!",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Greatest Musical Ever,"As everyone says, Singin' in the Rain is the greatest musical ever. It has everything. Great songs, great dancing and a funny story. Gene Kelly, one of my favorite actors, is absolutely fantastic playing the lead character Don Lockwood. When he performed the title song I was taken away and when he dances it is simply amazing. Donald O'Connor, who plays Cosmo Brown is also very  hilarious especially when he sings ""Make 'Em Laugh."" My favorite scene is when Kelly and O'Connor sing ""Moses."" I thought the dancing was incredible. Singin' in the Rain is one of my favorite movies of all time and whenever I am feeling down in the dumps I just put Singin' in the Rain in my VCR and it makes me feel a little better.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Awful,"I know this is going to be contentious, but I HATED this film. I'm a fan of musicals, but this is by far the worst musical I've ever seen. I only carried on after the first half hour because my wife came to watch (and ridicule) it with me.. otherwise I could not have taken any more. I found it so boring that I didn't care one bit what the ending was going to be - I was ready to go out for dinner, but my wife said she was at least curious to know the ending.It's musicals like ""Singin' in the Rain"" that help give musicals a bad rep amongst the young IMO - people bursting into cheesy, pointless songs, with ridiculous, goofy expressions on their faces while doing slapstick dance routines that make you want to cringe with embarrassment. It was all so silly - over-the-top acting at every turn, Cosmo's clowning around downright embarrassing, and some of the cheesiest effects imaginable in the dance routines. As far as being a comedy, there's more good humour in the first 5 minutes of Phantom of the Opera than there is in SITR.The only scene of any worth at all is the title song, which is understandably a classic scene. But the film itself is just horrible. It embodies everything I don't like about old musicals. Another ""classic"" movie I hope I never have to sit through again.UGH. 2/10.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
I tried to think of all the film's flaws...,"and came up with:1. Don Lockwood and Cosmo Brown are supposed to be about the same age, judging by their childhood flashbacks, but as adults Don looks significantly older (Gene Kelly being thirteen years the senior of Donald O'Connor).2. When Don leaps from a streetcar into Kathy Selden's convertible, she doesn't recognize him, which is odd considering that she later confesses to having seen a ton of his pictures (implying she's a big closet fan). Maybe they'd planned for the makeup crew to muss him up and then forgot about it.3. I wish that the weakest song in the film (""Make 'Em Laugh"", Arthur Freed's quick knock-off of Cole Porter's ""Be A Clown"") didn't accompany what is probably the best dance routine in the film.4. The woman doing Kathy Selden's singing for ""Would You?"" (Betty Noyes) doesn't sound anything like Debbie Reynolds.5. Events in the picture are a little condensed in relation to the real-life birth of the sound era. It's unlikely that a 1927 film like ""The Dueling Cavalier"" would have been hastily remade into a talkie.(I thought about including points like ""a few of Don Lockwood's spiffy outfits are really ugly"" and ""that head-of-the-studio guy is sometimes annoying"" but then decided that these things, which were no doubt intentional, added to the charm.)And I couldn't think of anything else. The fact that such minor nitpicking was all I could come up with in the movie's disfavor should give an idea of how good it is--as almost all the other reviews here confirm. (Yes, I know some folks think the ""Broadway Rhythm"" sequence is as long and unwieldy as Cyd Charisse's scarf and that ""You Were Meant For Me"" is a little poky, but I wouldn't change either of them. I doubt most people would, when you get right down to it.)",,Anonymous,Romance
A homage to movies and actors,"This movie still stands as a rock today, over half a century after its release. As movies from the 40s and 50s seem to be a bit slow compared to today's standards (for example in movement and conversation) this is certainly not the case in 'Singin' in the Rain'.Maybe 'The Sound Of Music' is a winner when it comes down to remarkable and memorable tunes, but this movie also has a few pretty tricks on its sleeve.First of all there is the fabulous and superb choreography and (tap) dancing, one of the most impressive achievements in movie history.Secondly this movie is a homage to movies and actors, in their struggles to make the movie a mature form of art.And last but not least, there is humor all over the place. Especially the ups and downs of making and releasing the first 'talkie' musical is extremely funny.'Singin' in the rain' is therefore a milestone in the evolution of movie making and deserves to be watched by everyone who likes dance and musical.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

the best musical out there,"Singin in the rain is a classic musical in the 50's that will leave you smiling all through as well as laughing. As the movie commences, you have to hold your breath because you don't picture it coming out as a classic but as time progresses and some of the acts come into play, this movie takes a shape in your mind leaving behind an imprint that you won't forget.Having moderate success in the box office, as it was produced with $ 2.5 Million and it made over $ 7 Million in the box office. This movie became known by critics as one of the best musicals ever made and it stars Gene Kelly, who also directed and provided the choreography for the movie. The movie's plot featured the transition from silent film to talkies and the reactions of the actors involved, it also features the birth of musical films. Mentions were made of the first talkie The Jazz Singer in 1927.The movie has a cast of three leads, Gene Kelly as Don Lockwood, Donald O'Connor as Cosmo Brown and Debbie Reynolds as Kathy Selden. In 1927, Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont are a Hollywood romantic pair on screen but Lina, however thinks the on-screen romance is real love.Don with his former partner Cosmo has been together for years and their chase of success led to Don's rise to fame. Don and Lina's latest film is being transformed into a talkie musical but with Lina being unable to sing and act in talkies Kathy Selden is brought in to help provide the voice for Lina, which was then recorded over Lina's.During the movie production Debbie Reynolds faced major criticism from Gene Kelly, because she couldn't dance. As she was crying away under a piano, the great Fred Astaire (Astaire is named the fifth greatest male actors of all times, and whose dancing is known to have influenced many popular artist including Michael Jackson and Gregory Hines) who took her under his wings and taught her how to dance.The films famous dance routine which featured Gene Kelly singing the title song, twirling an umbrella and dancing in the rain. Kelly was sick with a fever during the shoot, as he was soaked. The shooting of the dancing scene took 3 days to shoot.Receiving a 100% approval in Rotten Tomatoes, and rated the best Musical film of all time by the American Film Institute (AFI) and is rated 5th greatest movie of all time in the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition).

"Believe it or not, there are better musicals out there.","I don't like usin' the word ""overrated"" ('cause it always sounds like: ""people who loved this movie are idiots""). Still, I seen too many hyperbolic comments about Singin' In The Rain: ""best musical ever"", ""best movie ever""... sorry but I really can't agree.Since my English is quite bad, I'll get straight to the point: as a comedy, it's VERY dated, and quite childish to boot. It's not a complete disaster, some lines are still pretty funny, but everything else is naïve to say the least - and I think it wasn't so good even in the fifties.Talking' about the ""musical"" part... two songs are simply beautiful (""Make 'Em Laugh"" and, of course, the immortal ""Singin' in the rain""), the rest is just good, but not memorable; only when it comes to dancin', the movie shines. Still, some dancin' sequences don't fit with the rest of the movie: if you seen Michael Kidd's awesome work for ""Seven Brides For Seven Brothers"" (now THAT's a masterpiece that aged well), you can't help but notice it.If you only watched this one, do yourself a favor and try Little Shop Of Horrors, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, West Side Story.

Musicals...,"Let me start off by saying, I hate musicals.  Hate them.  I have little respect for a genre with such patently bizarre conventions as the musical. Of course, there will always be a place in my heart for The Wizard of Oz and The Sound of Music, as they are films that are more rites of passage than actual entertainment, they are part of the American cultural landscape in a way that makes them almost unavoidable.  I also, much to my chagrin, like Grease and Hair, but for different reasons.With all that said, I love Singin' in the Rain.  I love it.  It is one of the finest films that I have ever watched and I can watch it again and again.  SitR is a fun movie, that pokes fun at its own conventions and explodes them in strange and wonderful ways.Gene Kelly is simply too cool.  He is one of the few men that project cool while doing goofy and graceful dance steps (Billy Joel could pull it off sometimes too).  Gene Kelly is a damn cool guy with the chops and credentials to make nearly any role legitimate.  SitR is no exception. Especially the bizarre, Bernhard-esque dance number at the end, which Kelly choreographed himself.  Fantastic.Donald O'Connor, though, is one of the main reasons why this film works.  He is damn funny.  His hyperkinetic Make'm Laugh skit still gets me rolling today.  He is beyond brilliant in this film and really makes his scenes work.The plot itself is interesting, it is a musical about the origins of musicals.  It is a romance, a comedy, a history lesson and a some of the best dance numbers ever all rolled into one.  I don't really know what else to say about this film except... wow.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Entertaining,"Although I wouldn't call this film Oscar worthy, it was definitely one that captured my attention. The quick witted humor between Don and Cosmo, as well as the adorable romance between the Hollywood beau and the up-and-comer were entertaining, to say the least.I do however, believe this movie is both wonderfully simple and highly overrated. Yes, the musical numbers are outstanding, the singing and dancing are great, the cinematography looks beautiful, and there's some memorable sequences, but overall, this feels rather light. But, it did irritate me that most of the musicals numbers weren't really there to serve the story or move things forward, but just pass the time.I will say, that Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly's direction is flawless. Rather than the quick cutting and intense camera movement which is supposed to create more excitement but is really just proof of the director's lack of confidence, Kelly and Donen are content to simply enjoy the spectacle of each amazing set-piece. Their restraint is on display throughout the entire film, trusting that the audience is feeling each moment without the need for explicitly telling them.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Here's 1 person who hates this movie,"I know this film is considered a classic among classics, but as a knowledgeable fan of 1920's music, I always thought this film was the most typically bad example of rewriting late 1920's/early 1930's history. Yes, the settings and costumes are more proper to the period than other films, but the arrangements of the music is strictly 1952.Also, I must put in a plug; I have always thought that Gene Kelly was the most overrated Dancer/Actor of that era.So, while I'm sure that my comments won't change anyone else's love for this movie, I, for one, have always thought it was another typical 1950's musical attempt at history with no grains of truth.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Jean Hagen's contribution makes 'Singin' in the Rain' one of the all-time greats...,"Much as I admire the talents of Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor, it's really Jean Hagen who provides us with the funniest, most hilarious moments in her way-over-the-top performance of the dumb film star with the appalling accent. Her character also provides the key to the plot for this witty look at Hollywood making the transition to sound films. A pity Hagen wasn't given any of the song numbers to participate in--but that's my only complaint. Everything is in good hands here--Kelly and Reynolds and O'Connor do outstanding jobs. The only other drawback, as I see it, is the extended Broadway musical number Kelly imagines and co-starring Cyd Charisse. It strikes a somewhat jarring note and wasn't really necessary. His song-and-dance routine in the rain is, of course, the most famous highlight--but equally endearing is the 'Good Mornin' number, staged with such style and verve and performed with gusto by the three stars. Betty Comden and Adolph Green provided a supremely funny script, somewhat reminiscent of an older film with Alice Faye and Don Ameche called 'Hollywood Cavalcade'('39), which also dealt with the transition from silent to sound movies. One of the great MGM musicals, not to be missed.",,Anonymous,Romance

Exuberant and sublime,"SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is quite possibly my favourite musical of all time, a glorious and sublime experience in movie-making which shines with sheer exuberance and, it has to be said, brilliance. Nobody puts a foot wrong - literally - in this colourful, song-packed outing which really offers career-best turns from the cast.Of course, the film belongs to Gene Kelly, whose professionalism towers above all. The titular sequence is highly memorable, but then so are many others, and none of them a disappointment. This is the kind of musical you can't watch without your foot tapping away, the sort of film that Hollywood producers try to hark back to but fail miserably because they truly don't make 'em like this anymore.The likes of Jackie Chan and other martial arts performers have cited Gene Kelly as a major influence on their work and it's clear to see how; the way Kelly moves, turns, and interacts with props, other performers, and scenery is just flawless. Even better, in some ways, is Donald O'Connor's solo number in which he performs the wall somersaults with dizzying splendour. SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is the sort of film that finishes leaving you with the feeling like you want to watch it all over again.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Broadway Sequence Doesn't Fit,"The Broadway dance sequence is quite phenomenal, but I always thought it was inconsistent with the rest of the movie.  It's pretty impressive for a 1952 musical, but not the sort of thing you'd expect to see in a 20s era studio's first talkie.  The movie (Singin' in the Rain) is about the making of a talkie about a dancing cavalier, but this modern sequence suddenly pops up unexpectedly.  And where's Lina Lamont who's supposed to be the star of the movie?The Broadway sequence is a joy to behold, but it really doesn't fit.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not All It's Cracked Up To Be,"I hate to say it, but I just don't understand all the hype about this movie. It has a good cast and great production values, including gorgeous color, but to me, it was just a ""pleasant"" movie -- not all that funny, and with only a couple of memorable dance numbers: The ""Singin' In the Rain"" number by Gene Kelly, and the terrific segment with the fantastically talented and sensuous Cyd Charisse. Why she didn't become a bigger star than she was, I'll never understand. Nothing against the also-talented and versatile Debbie Reynolds, but I would like to have seen less of Debbie and a lot more of Cyd. Maybe this is just a movie that hasn't worn well over the years, but to me, it's greatly overrated. All that being said, it's good family-type entertainment, and they couldn't make a musical like this today. Multi-talented performers like these are gone forever.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Top Song & Dance,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Classic musical making its way through art houses with a remastered format that causes the colors to jump off the screen.  Never a much of a Gene Kelly fan, however, his pompous persona lends itself very well to screen star Don Lockwood.  Tremendous performances by Kelly, O'Connor, Reynolds, Hagen and Charisse drive this spectacle to heights no other song & dance film has ever reached.  I do not rate it as the best musical of all-time, because I think ""Sound of Music"" and ""Music Man"" are both slightly better, but only ""West Side Story"" even comes close on the dancing.  O'Connor is nothing short of physically amazing on his ""Make 'em laugh"" and the trio's performance during ""Good Mornin'"" will leave you wanting more.  Jean Hagen is perfectly excrusciating as the screech-voiced Lina.  Truly, I think Reynolds and O'Connor should receive more credit for the success of the film.  Both are in supporting roles that nearly steal the film.

Im not big on musicals though i thought the artistic aspect of the film was very cool. As well as the ability of the main character to act and dance. I liked how the film used colors as well certain scenes were very vibrant with colors to set the mood while others had a lot of grey in them. I thought the setup for the film was amazing though as well as the editingt. The scenes were immensely large and abstract.

A good movie but no classic.,"If you closed your eyes and threw a potato into a crowded street, you'd be guaranteed to hit someone who loves this movie. Everyone loves this movie. Just looking at the other reviews here, it's hard to find anyone who thinks it's anything less than a masterpiece. I guess I'll just have to be Billy No-Mates, because I found it to be significantly less than that.Whether you've seen it or not, you've at least heard of it and been made aware of its reputation, but as is so often the case, its reputation overstates its virtues. But while it may have been a fair distance from the five-star masterpiece I was expecting, it was still a good, and sometimes great, movie.The first thing that struck me was Gene Kelly's smile. Cheesier than a statue of Celine Dion carved in Gorgonzola, it simply refused to leave his face. He seemed incapable of frowning, and typified the mood of the movie. Its relentless cheer and optimism was infectious, and it is easy to understand why so many people describe it as a feelgood film. No one could be miserable watching this.There is an unavoidable quaintness in the film. Set in the 1920s, as silent movies gave way to talkies, it both celebrates and gently mocks a legendary era in Hollywood history. But the movie itself is now part of another legendary era in Hollywood history, and this double-nostalgia works only in its favour and adds to its immense charm.The cast is excellent without exception. Gene Kelly is great, and Donald O'Connor is just hilarious. He seems to be having the greatest time in the world making this movie and making em laugh. His face-pulling scene is undoubtedly one of the funniest moments the film has to offer. Jean Hagan is perfect as Lina Lamont, and gives us a truly original character. The scene where her terrible voice is revealed was lessened somewhat by having seen a similar joke in The Man with Two Brains, but this deserves the laughs having got there thirty years earlier. Her stupidity is at its funniest when she insists she and Kelly are an item because she was told so by the gossip columns, and she is blessed with perhaps the funniest line of the film: `Why, I make more money than... than... than Calvin Coolidge, put together!'It may be stating the obvious, but the dancing was just mesmerising. Kelly and O'Connor move as if on ice, and their energy is just stunning. To see real talent like theirs, and then switch to the jerky, simplified arm-waving that appears in every video on MTV, emphasises their genius. The songs, however, were something of a disappointment. With the exception of the title track and Make Em Laugh, they are nothing special. There were times when they felt forced into the story rather awkwardly, with Good Morning being the most irritating example.I can understand why so many people love this film, but I have no love for it myself. It was fun, and there were a load of great moments, but it didn't come close to being a masterpiece. I know I'm in the minority. For most people, it's a flawless classic. Like most of Cher, it will live forever, and that's fair enough. There is a long list of classic movies which have all disappointed me, and this was by no means the worst offender. I just wish I could have liked it more.",,Anonymous,Romance

"I can't stop smiling,,,Help!","Singin' in the Rain is one of those movies I think of when I think ""classic"". I have a question; who can hate this movie? Just like Wizard of Oz, this movie is so full of life, so colorful, so upbeat, so happy, what's not to like? The songs are great, the characters are great, the art direction is great, everything is just great. This movie brings such a big smile to my face that I have to go to a surgeon to fix it. If you're ever feeling down, Singin' in the Rain is the perfect movie to watch. I love the story, and how it tells of the tragic time when movies went to sound and a lot of actors couldn't make the transition. It's like The Artist, but much happier. The acting is typical 1950s musical acting, and there's a lot of corniness to the whole thing, but that's what makes it hold up so well today. Just like Wizard of Oz, this is a movie most people see at a young age, and grow up loving it. It doesn't seem realistic, but this is classic Hollywood. We don't watch movies to see our own lives, we watch movies because they're the opposite of our terrible reality, and they allow us to escape for a short time. It may be a little silly at times, but it just shows how much fun making movies can be. Singin' in the Rain is a classic, and one of the greatest films of all time. It really is one of the most lovable classics in American cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Magical!,"Singing in the rain is an absolute movie feast! The movie focuses on that period of time in which the entire motion picture film industry was in nervous transition from silent to talking pictures. Although the movie compresses time in this respect - the transition actually took about three years. There was an overabundance of musicals in the first batch of talking films, many stars did have heavy accents that made their speech undecipherable or voices that came across like nails on a chalkboard like Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) and saw their careers ruined, and early sound technology itself was so fragile that you would often see actors speaking to potted plants or to coat racks with comic effect.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
So close to perfect,"I got to see Singin' in the Rain as part of a double-feature with An American in Paris; I know that one's not as widely beloved, but they're two classic Hollywood musicals I've always found very enjoyable, even though I'm not always crazy about such musicals from this era. I can remember where and why I watched Singin' in the Rain on the two occasions before this, and I'll likely remember the context of watching it this third time. I think that's the sign of a good movie. The memory of watching and rewatching it becomes a core one, usually incidentally. And I will say, watching this at a cinema made it so much better. I appreciated the camerawork and everything visually so much more when it was on a big screen, and movies about movie-making always benefit greatly from being seen in a cinema. I love being in a cinema and watching people in a movie watch a movie - it never gets old for me, and Singin' in the Rain is one of the quintessential movies about making movies.That might all sound like praise which would suggest a perfect score is in order, and, for what it's worth, I feel like the first 80% of this movie is pretty much perfect. But the Broadway Melody number that takes up what feels like 15 to 20 minutes (it's probably closer to 10) right near the end... I've never liked it. There's a punchline to how long it goes on for and how gibberish it is, but I don't feel like that payoff makes it worthwhile. I do love the visuals of Cyd Charisse's ridiculously long white dress (or whatever you call it, I don't know) in that one part, but the sequence outside that feels less inspired than all the other musical numbers, and divorced from the movie narratively/thematically. Every time I go back to this film, I hope to understand (or even just enjoy) that sequence, but I never do.The film would still be 90-ish minutes without it. I wish it wasn't there. Everything else is fantastic; I guess a nitpick would be that Lina Lamont doesn't come off as villainous as I think they wanted her to be, but she's still a fun character and it's one of those things I know would be done differently today and can excuse it being the way it is because of the age. Seriously though, everything else is exactly what I want out of a classic musical. I love everything outside the Broadway Melody tangent (Cyd Charisse and her dress can stay; otherwise, I wish it wasn't in this film).",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Believe me, the number was not small.In a nutshell, these famous actors of the Silent Era may have projected plenty of that wonderful thing called ""charisma"" onto the silver screen, but when it came to their voices (ugh!), they were atrocious!Actors such as the super-dashing leading man, John Gilbert, with his laughable, high-pitched lisp, and the ultra-chic beauty, Barbara La Marr, with her horrendous Bronx honk, were literally laughed right off the screen when their voices were finally heard by movie-audiences all across the nation.In Singin' In The Rain, actress Jean Hagen is absolutely priceless as Lena Lamont, the seductive superstar of silent films. I mean, Lena may have looked like a million bucks, but, whoa, when that babe opened her trap, man, she had a voice that could literally rupture eardrums from 50 paces. No kidding.Hagen's ""Lena"" was a prime example of an actress whose career was, most surely, destined for the axe once ""Talkies"" took over in 1927.All-In-All - Singin' In The Rain ranks right up there as one of the greatest and most entertaining Hollywood Musicals of all-time. Even if ""Musicals"" aren't your thing, you'll find it near impossible not to enjoy this high-energy, non-stop spectacle of song, dance, and comedy.Singin' In The Rain is a fond recreation of that bygone movie-making era when the flourishing Hollywood film industry was making its shaky transition into the greatest sensation of all - Talking pictures.The entire cast in this film are all absolutely first-rate, with everyone putting in a stellar performance from start to finish.My favourite musical number was ""Broadway Melody"".",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
THE GREATEST MOVIE MUSICAL!,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE! Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, Donald O'Connor, and Jean Hagen are just great in this movie! The best sequences are Gene's 'Singin' in the rain' dance in the rain (pure cinematic genius!), the scene where Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) tries to say her lines with a diction coach (Kathleen Freeman) (her 'can't' comes out 'cain't), the 'Good Morning' dance with Gene, Debbie, and Donald, and the famous 'Broadway Melody' ballet with Kelly and Cyd Charisse (with a Clara Bow/Louise Brooks haircut and a seductive dress). I was in a production of 'Guys and Dolls' and the kids in the troupe worshiped this musical. I would watch this film over and over again without getting tired of it! As many film buffs say, this is 'the greatest musical ever'. 10/10",,Anonymous,Romance
An injection of joy,Family film night. Old school classic. First time I've seen this and what a wonderful movie. Incredible dance numbers and comic timing. An injection of joy.

Whimsical and educational,"Singin' in the Rain is a whimsical and, I'd say, educational musical. This movie portrays some of the struggles that came with the introduction of talking pictures in a way that keeps a song in your heart and your toe tapping.

A musical for those who don't like musicals,"I'm not a musical fan, and I've seen quite a few, but I have to say that ""Singin' in the Rain"" is the best musical I've seen. It's a musical for people who don't like musicals. Aside from the fact that the numbers featured are immortal, the dancing is a lot more athletic and frankly amazing, for those of us who don't really ""get"" Fred Astaire.What grabbed me about ""Singin' in the Rain"" is that it's about a serious issue, the move from silent films to talkies, and actually features some real-world detail, like a star losing her career when she opens her mouth to speak, and a relationship manufactured by a studio.The movie lost my attention at times, but it works. Watching it back-to-back with ""Wizard of Oz"", I never felt the same apprehension when each musical number started. The dancing helped - though I was more impressed by O'Connor than Kelly.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
What a Glorious Feeling!,"Self-referential art can be tedious. Although there are exceptions, it is generally a safe rule of thumb that any novel whose main character is a novelist should be left on the bookshop or library shelf. About conceptual works of art whose purpose is to make a meaningful statement about the purpose of works of art, the less said the better. And when Hollywood makes a film about Hollywood the result is normally either introspective navel-gazing or smug self-congratulation.There are, however, exceptions. The early fifties saw two great movies about the movie industry, one a tragedy (""Sunset Boulevard"" from 1950) and the other a comedy (""Singin' in the Rain"" from two years later). Remarkably, both films were inspired by the same actress, Norma Talmadge. Talmadge is today a largely forgotten figure; she was a huge star in the silent era of the 1910s and 1920s, but along with John Gilbert became one of the major casualties of the coming of sound in the late twenties. She made two ""talkies"", but neither was a success and her career came to an end in 1930. Part of the problem was her working-class New Jersey accent; American society is not as linguistically classless as some would like to believe. (Talmadge was still alive in 1952, and I often wonder what she made of these two films; in neither case is the character based on her portrayed in a very sympathetic way).""Singin' in the Rain"" is set in the Hollywood of 1927. The Talmadge figure is Lina Lamont, a highly popular silent film star working for the fictitious studio Monumental Pictures. Lina has a crush on her handsome co-star Don Lockwood and convinces herself that he is in love with her. In reality Don has little time for Lina who is vain, shallow and stupid. (She is also to prove bitchy and spiteful). When the first talking picture, ""The Jazz Singer"", proves an enormous success, the head of the studio decides that he will convert the new Lockwood and Lamont film, ""The Dueling Cavalier"", into a talkie. (The film is a romance set during the French Revolution; Talmadge's final film, ""Du Barry, Woman of Passion"" was also set in eighteenth-century France). This, however, proves to be a problem, as Lina has a harsh and grating voice, and attempts to give her elocution lessons prove unsuccessful. A young actress, Kathy Selden, is hired to dub Lina's voice. The rest of the film deals with the growing romance between Don and Kathy and with Lina's sexual and professional jealousy of her young rival.Mention ""Singin' in the Rain"" to anyone today and they will probably think of the sequence in which Gene Kelly performs the title song, a sequence which has become famous, even among those who have not seen the actual film. Even parodies of it, such as the one performed by the British comedy duo Morecambe and Wise, have become famous in their own right.There is, however, more to this film than just one single scene. It is often compared with that other fine Gene Kelly musical from a year earlier, ""An American in Paris"". The two films, however, are quite different, and each has its own strengths. ""An American in Paris"" is certainly more visually imaginative, and I would also rank it higher in terms of its music. Although ""Singin' in the Rain"" has some well-known songs, including not only the title song but also the likes of Make 'Em Laugh"" and ""Good Morning"", I would not class these as highly as Gershwin's music used in the earlier film. Both films have a balletic sequence designed to show off Kelly's dance skills. In ""An American in Paris"" he dances with Leslie Caron, who plays his love-interest in that film, but here his partner is not his leading lady Debbie Reynolds but rather Cyd Charisse, who does not actually have an acting role. (At this stage of her career Reynolds was not regarded as a dancer).In terms of plot and of humour, however, ""Singin' in the Rain"" is the better of the two films; the plot of ""An American in Paris"" consists of little more than a boy, a girl and a happy ending. The phrase ""musical comedy"" (like ""romantic comedy"") does not always imply that a work is particularly humorous; it is often used as a description for any musical play or film except for the minority (like ""Carousel"" or ""West Side Story"") which end tragically. ""Singin' in the Rain"" is one of the few musical comedies which is worthy of the name. It is one of the few Hollywood films which actually dare to make fun of Hollywood itself. A lot of the humour derives from the difficulties the industry encountered during the early days of sound, not only actresses with dodgy voices- Jean Hagen's Lina is a great comic character- but also problems in hiding the ungainly and not very effective microphones and in synchronising the sound with the picture. One of the themes is the antagonism between stage and screen during this period- during the silent era, and even in the early years of the sound era, stage actors, particularly classically trained ones, despised the cinema which they saw as a vulgar pantomime. Here Kathy claims to be a stage actress, although it later turns out her experience has been rather limited. There is also a lot of physical comedy, especially in the scenes featuring Donald O'Connor as Don's friend Cosmo.""Singin' in the Rain"" was a hit at the box office, but it was not a great success with the critics, unlike ""An American in Paris"", which won the ""Best Picture"" Oscar for 1951. Over the years, however, its reputation has grown, and today it has come to be regarded as one of the great musicals, not only of its day but of all time. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
""" Course he's missed you,  He's been looking inside every cake for weeks""","When asked which musical film I remember best, few if any can compare to this all time memory maker. ""Singing in The Rain"" has it all. A simple but impressive story which winds itself through several decades of various films. Gene Kelly stars as Don Lockwood, a city hoofer who enjoys being a popular and noted 'silent' celebrity by everyone except Kathy Seldon (Debbie Reynolds) who rebuffs him by saying about movies, 'if you've seen one, you've seen them all.' His life long friend Cosmo Brown, played by (Donald O'Connor) is magically talented both singing and dancing which is nearly impossible for the obstacle in the picture, one Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen). When the studio discovers that silent pictures are obsolete, the director R.F. Simpson (Millard Mitchell) launches a new course for his cast, one which does not include Lamont. The movie is filled with many dance routines, which includes perhaps the most remembered song and dance number in Hollywood. I remember it well. Excellent film for any generation. ****",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Over the top at times, but fun to watch","I think some of the songs could have been cut. The dream-like sequence at the end didn't really seem to fit in, and also there are parts I think could have been cut out. The Good Morning song I guess makes sense (it was morning), but I think it could have been cut, for example.Regardless, it is an excellent example of a comedy, and of a musical done well. I just don't like it when they begin dancing spontaneously, as it takes me out of the world within the movie. That's just me though.The ending was fantastic as well, with the tension building up, and then the grand reveal behind the curtain, and everyone lives happily ever after. That didn't even feel contrived to me, and I think it's difficult to pull of a happy ending like that while making it feel natural.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

What a glorious feeling!...,"OK, after commenting on many of the great films that I liked very much, I figure it's about time to comment on one of the films that I truly love... ""Singin' in the Rain"".... I just adore the hell out of this film. There are only a few movies out there that can truly transcend any and all boundries, and make even the most depressed person joyful... Singin' in the Rain is one of them.This film is pure magic. In today's teenage-dominated film industry audiences seem to want more of an adrenaline-pumping, special effect-driven thrill ride instead of a film like this which is true cinema art. It communicates feelings of joy instead of mindless heart-pumping action. Today's films are not art... they are mass-produced moneymakers that attempt to give you nothing more than a rollercoaster-like experience. No substance to them at all...But back to the film, the performances are phenomenal! Gene is always great and is the true entertainer. In the famous 15 minute Broadway finale Gene combines three art forms into one (Song, Dance, & Film) to communicate the story of the aspiring actor who comes to Broadway without using one line of (spoken) diologue. This scene should also be noted as quite possibly the most beautiful use of technicolor ever committed to celluloid.Donald O'Connor... what can I say, the man is incredible! It is so refreshing to see a vaudeville performer in a film outside of the silent era. His gravity-defying performance of ""Make 'em Laugh"" echos the great silent comedians of the 20's (especially the great Buster Keaton)...And Ms. Debbie Reynolds rounds out the trio. She's magnificent... especially considering that it's one of her first roles. She posseses a wide range of emotion throughout the film, going from the popping out of a cake :) ...to the tears at the end. I really think her performance is underrated... she really brought so much of everything into this movie and I could never, ever picture anyone else in her role. It's really a shame that her performance of ""You are My Lucky Star"" was cut from the final print.Of course my favorite moment is when these three legends come together to sing ""Good Morning""... ahhh, pure magic!Anyway, I just thought I'd express my joy towards this film... not one of the greatest musicals of all time, not one of the great classics, but one of the greatest films of all time.... period.",,Anonymous,Romance
That's Entertainment!,"What is about Singin' in the Rain that even the film elite hold it in such high regard and has even appeared on a previous Sight & Sound poll as one of the ten greatest films of all time, ranking among traditional highbrow films? Singin' in the Rain is not just a great musical but also a film with a great story. It is not as harsh a critique on Hollywood as Sunset Boulevard but who would have still believed the content of fan magazines to be genuine after this film. Singin' in the Rain has a cynical side as it pulls apart the Hollywood myth; beginning with Don Lockwood's back-story as to how he rose to fame, which the movie comically shows us is full of crap. ""Dignity, always dignity"" but not if you want to make it to the top but at the end of the day Singin' in the Rain is a movie for movie lovers which celebrates Hollywood as much as it makes fun of it.The film is set in 1927 albeit a very colourful 1927. In 1952 Technicolor films were in their final years of production and would soon become a thing of the past. The movie is a tribute to MGM producer and songwriter Arthur Freed - head of the MGM Freed unit - the producers of some of the greatest film musicals of all time. Although the days of the studio system where coming to an end in the early 1950's as films from different studios started becoming homogenous and not containing unique aesthetics to each studio, the MGM musical still remained its own unique beast that no other studio could replicate. Likewise, the film studio in Singin' in the Rain is a fictional studio and not MGM itself, I guess that would have been too much of a self-endorsement.The soundtrack itself has entered the pop culture lexicon for good reason. I've had no shortage of listening to my CD soundtrack; glorious corn and camp topped with beautiful orchestrations, all of which never leaves your head and contributing to making Singin' in the Rain one of the go-to anti-depressant films. Few other songs can lift my mood more than Moses Supposes or the film's title number: could there be a greater expression of joy? After all, it is in the title; he is singing in the rain; turning the dreary rain into carefree joy, finding joy in despair. As for Make 'em Laugh, even though it is a plagiarism of Cole Porter's Be a Clown from The Pirate (1948), I considering Make 'em Laugh is a superior rendition. There is also that disorienting fashion parade sequence which could be removed and have no effect on the plot but I do love me some 50's fluff. But they do save the best for last in the form of the Broadway Melody Ballet. A number of MGM musicals had a lengthy ballet sequence, and to say they outdid themselves here would be an understatement as Gene Kelly dressed as Harold Lloyd with the go-getter attitude of the 1920's celebrates a simple notion, ""gotta dance!"". The visually asserting array of bright colours and impressionistic backgrounds is aided by Cyd Charisse; what a talent, what a figure!Singin' in the Rain presents a light-hearted and comical look at what actors and studios went through during the transition to sound. Few other scenes in cinema are as entertaining as Lina Lomant's failure to understand sound recording technology. This scene not only showcases the problems with the technology in its early days by picking up unwanted sounds (complete also with the classic angry movie director) but it perfectly captures the relatable frustration that comes with filmmaking. I can tell you there is nothing more frustrating than out-of-sync sound. Likewise, the star's difficulty in adapting to talkies and being laughed at by audiences parallel the legend of audiences being in howls of laughter as actor John Gilbert's attempts to deliver dialogue on screen. Jean Hagan playing the dumb broad Lina Loment does a comedy act similar to Judy Holiday but in my view better than Holiday ever did. Donald O'Connor on the other hand surely isn't human with his vaudeville-style act his facial and body movements and ability to walk up walls. Just name me a film with a more astounding display of talent. Here's to you Singin' In the Rain, I bow humbly to your cinematic and musical perfection.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Loved it!!!,"This film centers on an actor whose first ""talkie"" film is about to release, marking his transition from silent films. There is a mention of ""The Jazz Singer - movie""and Warner Bros, showcasing how talkies began, and it's impressive and I am glad that India adapted this technology within 3-4 years later came-up with Alam Ara in 1931.The film features several songs, each fitting naturally into the scenes - something I'm used to as an Indian viewer, where songs are part of storytelling. The comedy also works well for me, though I know humor is subjective.Jean Hagen's character is beautifully portrayed, especially since her acting is so good that you'd almost believe she was really ""dumb"" every-thing is fine util she don't speaks her lines 🤣. The film also highlights how mass-market films often follow predictable storylines or patterns (""if you've seen one, you've seen them all.""), emphasizing the importance of dialogue, audio, dubbing, smart decisions to avoid flops, and teamwork.One detail I noticed is how much effort goes into making an actor look good - it's a collaborative effort. In one scene, the main actor showcases film's sets and equipment to his crush, leading right a lovely romantic dance sequence on those same sets, It was executed beautifully.There was a smile on my face when i was watching this film.For more review me on Instagram : @Cineculturist.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Possibly my favorite film,"This may or may not be my final user review. I don't really know as I type this. Every character my fingers hits, every key-stroke, brings to me a new realization of my thoughts' worth on film. In that vein, I hope that what I've written has served those who've read my reviews to better guide them to quality entertainment, and hopefully with new insight.But, to the film.""Singing in the Rain"" has a special place in my heart. It's a window on an era of cinema that itself is another window on another era in cinema. We're seeing what the people of the 1950s thought of film some thirty to forty years before during its infancy.But, the real charm of the film is that we have a dancer who is masculine in his poetry. That, and he carries himself (to borrow from the film) with ""dignity"". This is another icon of male that a lot of men looked up to when the film was first released. Gene Kelley didn't ogle women, nor mistreat them. He showed gentle power through grace and poetry. A thing that today would be considered effete, or perhaps too high brow for the common man.But, even though we see Kelley giving us his smooth cultured delivery, we're also shown his comic side. He's a clown, but a smooth one. Even the most dignified have their comedic moments. He shows us guys how to court a cute young woman like Debbie Reynolds, and shows us that a woman of quality wants a man of quality. And quality doesn't come in the form of a fat bill fold, but the shedding of baser impulses, and embracing of the heart.Then we have Cosmo, the a-sexual friend whose relegated to the realm of emasculated dudeness. He's the class clown who never grew up. Does he date? We don't know. But then again, does it matter? He seems happy and content to play second string to Kelley's Lockwood character, but shines himself as he brings us the former Vaudevillian turned Hollywood supporting star.Then, there's Reynold's Kathy Selden character, who takes pot shots at the big boys from her humble station. She is elevated to professional performer status from her Catskills beginnings as a side show girl. She's beautiful and charming when she isn't being jealous of those who made it into ""the industry"", and is taken under the wing of Kelley's smitten character.The plot thickens with Jean Haggen's Lina Lamont, the not-so-ditzy blonde with a nose for leverage. She may not know art, but she knows what she likes. And she likes getting the lime light, and it doesn't matter whose talent she has to exploit to get that light shining on her instead of those making her the starlet she's been made into.There's the head of the studio, the high energy director, various supporting roles, and, of course, the musical numbers. Call me nuts, but I like a good musical. To me there's something reassuring about men and women being able to show their physical prowess to the creative notes conjured by a musical mind. To me that's the peak of expressionism. Why musicals have been unfairly attached to fringe and counter culture is beyond me. Sure, they're old and corny, but why attach a feminist quality to those characteristics?The great thing about ""Singing in the Rain"" is that it's a musical comedy that formulaic, doesn't take itself very seriously, but is smashingly successful. The guy gets the girl in the end, and isn't that what it's all about?""Singing in the Rain"" is good old fashioned Hollywood film. It truly is, in every sense of the word. It was done in the days before CGI and green/blue-screen techniques, has its own brand of SFX, has a lot of dazzling production numbers (again, to wow the audience in the days before model spaceships and CGI), and somehow manages to focus all of that on the haphazard and somewhat rocky (yet still sweet) flavored courtship between a man who wants to be a talented star, but isn't, and a woman who should, but is held back. The two eventually meet, and romantic magic is conjured.And I guess that's why it's my favorite film. It has all the gags and good musical numbers from days of old, but it also tells a tale of the way love ought to turn out. The way it ought to be. And, in spite of all the Hollywood gloss, glitz and glamor, it stays focused on that single message.There's of course Gene's famous dance number, which, truth be told, should resound with every red blooded male who's ever fallen for that one special lady. It should also give us guys hope that that special lady is out there, just waiting to inspire us so that we too can go splashing, and Singing, in, the Rain.I loved films from my days as a boy. This film was, and still is, one of my inspirations for life. If I were to go back into the film industry, hopefully, if allowed, I would be able to go back in time and visit the MGM lot during its musical hey-day, and help create magnificent films like the one I just reviewed. Something with a lot of humor, pizazz, little violence, and gentle story about a man and a woman meeting one another. I think I've always felt that... in fact I'm pretty sure I always have.With that, I'm going to end my series of reviews here for now.

Genius Gene Kelly in one of the best music scenes in the history of cinema,"This film is on all the lists of the best films of all time.

Hooray a musical about a Musical =/,"In my own opinion if you want to make a musical about a musical you better be Mel Brooks. ""Singin' in the Rain"" (1952) is by no means a bad movie and the dancing and comedic feats of Donald O'Connor as Cosmo Brown are sure to delight anyone, but the this musical movie is about the making of musical movies and at times seems to trade of substance to add an extra dance number. If you love Musicals by all means this is the film for you, but if your like me and your indifferent about them I'd steer clear of this one. To me a good musical will incorporate the song/dance number into the actually plot, ""Singin' in the Rain"" (1952) often fails to do this. Now the scene where Don Lockwood and Kathy Selden finally meet up again and have a romantic duet in a studio on a Hollywood lot the film does a great job of incorporating the song into the plot. An example of where the movie fails to do this is during the number ""Moses Supposes"" where Don and Cosmo are at a professor of linguistics office and break out into this goofy little number for pure entertainment. Now I don't mind a funny goofy musical scene but at least make it matter!!!

Basically soggy,"The title song is catchy, and it's doubtless interesting for younger viewers (those under 65) to see why this guy was so happy that he'd get all wet and yet remain in high spirits. The whole thing is so clearly fake that the most impressive thing in that scene (apart from the cunning decision not to use cardboard for the lamp-posts) is the wonderful drainage on the set.Hmmm... you write a tongue-in-cheek review with a sarcastic title, and now the reviews are of course reviewed... well, fair enough, this is not a ""useful"" review, as determined by fans of the film that have been willing to trawl through and rate the 200 or so comments... but for the average Joe who will probably never make it through to the last pages of the reviews anyway, feel free to make up your own mind -- if you're planning to direct or star in your own musical, it may be compulsory viewing -- there's no denying it is a classic that captured the hearts of a generation or two.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Musical Switch To Talkies,"'Singin' in the Rain' has been mentioned as an all-time favourite musical by many and I can totally see why. It is such a delightfully hilarious film, one that can be easily enjoyed with family or a group of friends. The story outline revolves around the switch from silent movies to talkies and how a film crew, namely the stars and the producers attempt to create a talking movie but there is one problem. The leading lady has a ghastly voice and she can't act. Enter Kathy Selden who offers to be a partial replacement.Donen and Kelly do a stupendous job as directors. It's remarkable how they have brought such a well-crafted piece on screen. For Kelly this is a multiple achievement on different levels as he directs, acts, sings and dance. Clearly the guy is a multi-talented legend. Cosmo Brown too is great as the laugh-out-loud supportive friend. His physical comedy are among the funniest sequences of the film. Debbie Reynolds is pretty ands vivacious. She is lovely, both as singer and actress. Jean Hagen deserves mention as the squeaky voiced and arrogant Lina Lamont.The songs are full of energy and spectacularly shot. The dances are amazingly choreographed and a treat to watch. The visuals are pleasantly colourful. The cinematography is superb, especially the long takes.

A great movie that's great fun,"There are plenty of movies which may be a lot of fun but aren't really great movies. Singin' in the Rain is a great movie. And great fun. It is one of the most iconic movies ever and deservedly so. Even people who have never seen the whole movie know Gene Kelly splashing about in the rain. But this is a movie which is so much more than that one legendary musical number. For starters there are plenty of other musical numbers which are just as good as, or perhaps depending on your tastes, even better than Kelly's famous nighttime twirl through the rainy streets. But what makes the movie truly great is that it does not have to rely solely on the big song-and-dance numbers. This is a movie with a great story. So many musicals are just biding their time between songs. Not this one. There are actually compelling things going on between the songs. And funny things too. Add it all up and this is absolutely fabulous entertainment.It's Kelly everyone remembers most but great credit must also go to his co-stars Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds. The three of them make such a great team, their Good Morning number is as good as it gets, just as much of a highlight as the title song. We know what a legendary dancer Kelly is but O'Connor and Reynolds more than hold their own. O'Connor even gets a showcase of his own with Make 'Em Laugh, a number which is as much acrobatics as dance. Kelly, O'Connor and Reynolds are all terrific in their singing, their dancing and their acting. And yet perhaps the best performance is turned in by Jean Hagen. And Hagen doesn't do any singing or dancing at all. And that's the point. Hagen, a wonderfully talented actress, is playing a completely terrible actress who can't sing, can't dance, can't even talk. It takes a great actress to pull that off and Hagen absolutely nails it.The story takes place in Hollywood at the dawn of the talking pictures era. Kelly and Hagen play Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont, the most famous and popular screen couple of the time. But they are silent film stars, the transition to talkies will be quite painful. The biggest problem is Lina's voice which is indescribably bad, grating to the extreme. The movie has plenty of fun at her expense and milks lots of laughs out of the overall struggle of those working in film at the time to come to grips with this newfangled sound technology. How can Don Lockwood go forward in this new era if he's attached to the talentless dim-bulb Lina? Enter, thanks to a rather ingenious suggestion from Don's friend Cosmo Brown, young Kathy Selden. Kathy's got the talent and the charm Lina lacks and Reynolds plays the part of the wide-eyed girl caught up in the crazy world of Hollywood so beautifully. Don and Kathy could be a great pairing, on and off screen...if only Lina could be nudged out of the way.There is a story here full of comic possibilities and the movie takes full advantage of it. O'Connor's character of Cosmo has a few clownish moments but nothing too far over-the top. No need for a lot of slapstick silliness. The movie's more subtle than that. Smarter too. And whereas many musicals struggle to weave the songs into the story everything fits together wonderfully here. The only real misstep comes near the end with a huge production number which unfortunately sticks out like a sore thumb. In addition to going on for far too long it is quite disconnected from the plot. It really seems like an indulgence for co-director Kelly. There was nobody who could tell him it didn't belong. It's performed very well, it just is out of place. And it stops the movie's momentum just as it should be building to a big finish. It's one musical number too far. But that should not detract from what is all in all a brilliantly conceived and performed movie. It may have slowed down a touch at the end but it still has its big finish, and a thoroughly satisfying finish at that. Such a fun, enjoyable, charming movie. Great entertainment. What a glorious feeling indeed.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Makes you want to sing,"It is 1927 and Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) a recognized Hollywood duo are making another movie everything is going along swimmingly when the movieThe Jazz Singer (1927), comes out.

"A Singing, Dancing Masterpiece","This film is set in a time where silent films are being converted to talkies. And the trouble lies in the fact that the successful duo, Lamont and Lakewood, have a woman (Jean Hagen) whose voice is more or less awful. How can they continue to be successful and open their mouths?I had some concerns with this film. Gene Kelly gets all the credit, but his little buddy is clearly the better dancer, especially during his long comedy scene. Sure, Kelly has more talking time, but the other guy gets the short end of the stick (so much so that I cannot even recall his name). Also, Lena's voice is made out to be bad, but it really wasn't that awful. Judy Holliday has roughly the same voice in ""Born Yesterday"" and no one complains. I'm not sure why this is called ""Singin' in the Rain"", as that's just one scene... it could just as easily have been called ""The Dueling Cavalier"". Oh well.The humor of converting silents to talkies is pretty great, more or less the highlight of the film. The strategic use of hidden microphones, and how the sound can get out of sync. The film as a whole is good and has some nice dance sequences if that's what you're into, but this part was really want made it memorable. This will go down as one of the greatest films in MGM history, and someday maybe it will get a retroactive ""Best Picture"" Oscar.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Overrated Trash,"""Singin' in the Rain"" is a terrible musical that has been absurdly lauded by the Hollywood establishment types just because the plot revolves around the Hollywood film industry. Equally bad is the similar 2016 musical ""La La Land."" Both have been heaped honors just as a means of self-congratulation and flattery. Beware, ""Singin' in the Rain"" features annoying characters, dumb plot, badly choreographed dancing, and little in the way of nice music.

But several of the song and dance numbers seem like they were in the movie just because they thought there should be a song and dance number at that point.  The numbers didn't advance the story, or illustrate people's emotions, or anything like that.

A really great Hollywood parody actually.,"Never knew that the movie ""Singin' in the Rain"" was not just any other musical movie, starring a singing and dancing Gene Kelly. The movie is actually being a great parody as well of Hollywood society, how all big Hollywood productions are very much alike, studio's, the actor's big star behavior and everything else surrounding- and involved with the industry.The movie is set at the end of the silent movie era in 1927 and 1928, when the ""The Jazz Singer"" got released. This meant new opportunities for some studios and some actors but also meant the end of a lot of other actors and movie-makers, who were not suitable enough to work with the new sound medium for movies. This movie shows people from both these groups and also shows how the Hollywood-world works and how careers get made and ended in the blink of an eye. The movie is not too afraid to show this more evil and less glamorous side of the whole industry but of course at all times with a wink and fun and charm added to it.Fore ""Singin' in the Rain"" is a real colorful and entertaining movie, that of course is still best known for its musical numbers. It has some of the best songs that the genre has to offer in it, including of course the well known title song of the movie, performed by Gene Kelly. It's one of those typical studio shot musical with some grand looking numbers in it, with lots of big sets and dancers involved. It also on the other hand has some smaller and more timid moments and it knows to create a well balance between these two musical styles. Cyd Charisse also makes a grand appearance and does what she did do best; dance, show of her legs and look greatly sensual, in a silent role.It's a greatly entertaining movie to watch, both through its musical aspects and comedy parody references to the world of Hollywood.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"No Doubt About It, One of the Best","This 1952 classic romp often tops critics' and audiences' lists of best musicals-sometimes of best movies, period-of all time. Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor star as dancing buddies, while Debbie Reynolds sets her sites on Kelly by trying to convince him that she is not the least bit interested. Watch as O'Connor throws himself around like a ragdoll, singing ""Make 'Em Laugh,"" and Cyd Charisse, one of the best dancers ever to appear on screen, adds elegance to a film that is set in the 1920s, when sound motion pictures spelled career-end for many a whiney-voiced silent film star, spoofed in this film by the hilarious Jean Hagen. The film also revived the song of the same title by Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed, which was first popularized in ""Hollywood Review of 1929."" Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen directed the movie, with story and screenplay by the dynamic husband-and-wife team Betty Comden and Adolph Green, lyrics by Arthur Freed.

An absolute masterpiece,"An absolute masterpiece, and easily, easily the highest rating. Gene Kelly's performance of 'Singin' in the Rain' has to be the greatest dance numbers ever performed on film, and I could watch it over and over again. He's a genius throughout this movie as both actor and director. It's just one fantastic number after another, including Donald O'Connor's 'Make 'Em Laugh', the two gentlemen and a 19-year- old Debbie Reynolds performing 'Good Morning' which includes that beautiful sofa sequence at the end, and Kelly dancing with Cyd Charisse in a stunning ""imagined sequence within an imagined sequence"", with beautiful modern art touches – and many others. This film works on all levels – a musical, of course, but also a romantic-comedy, and an ode to Hollywood's past. It makes you feel good not just because of the story, but because of the irrepressible joy in the performances, and because of you know you're seeing real artistry in the choreography and execution. They make it look smooth and easy, often making the most (so creatively!) out of an economy of space, but if you read the stories of the effort that went in, you'll appreciate it all the more. It's not for nothing that the cast of LaLaLand watched this movie every day on set for inspiration. Pure joy.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Timeless classic,"I was going to write a long review eulogising about the spellbinding choreography, the timeless songs and the one-of-a-kind chemistry between the cast but what is the point when every film fan already knows what a timeless classic it is? It is easy to be cynical about the Hollywood machine, and even the film itself gently satirises the system that made it, yet every now and again that soulless production line churns out a perfectly formed piece of screen magic where every element is in perfect unity. In 1952 such an event occurred and Singin' in the Rain has been enthralling generations of people ever since.It is pure undiluted cinema at its finest.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
10/10,"Singin' in the Rain is a timeless masterpiece that continues to captivate audiences with its charm, wit, and infectious energy. From the moment the opening credits roll, it's clear that this film is a celebration of cinema itself-its magic, its evolution, and the joy it brings. Gene Kelly's legendary performance, especially in the iconic ""Singin' in the Rain"" number, is nothing short of mesmerizing. His seamless blend of dancing, singing, and effortless charisma makes every scene unforgettable.The supporting cast, including Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor, delivers stellar performances that balance humor, heart, and sheer talent. O'Connor's ""Make 'Em Laugh"" is a comedy classic, and Reynolds shines with a perfect blend of vulnerability and strength. The film's vibrant choreography, clever script, and lush musical numbers make it an absolute delight from start to finish.But it's more than just the performances-the story itself is wonderfully engaging. The behind-the-scenes look at Hollywood's transition from silent films to talkies is both entertaining and insightful, while also providing a timeless message about the power of adaptability, creativity, and love. The movie is a perfect blend of nostalgia and modern appeal, showing just why Singin' in the Rain remains one of the greatest musicals ever made.If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and experience this iconic film. It's a joyous ride, brimming with heart, laughter, and all the reasons we love movies. A true five-star classic!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Overrated but cute,"It's a shame that Gene Kelly's most famous movie is Singin' in the Rain. This is a man who's danced with a cartoon, on roller skates, and with a trash can lid strapped to one foot, but for some reason, he's famous for splashing around in some puddles and posing on a lamppost. The same argument can be said about Donald O'Connor who got his start singing with Bing Crosby, recreated many of Buster Keaton's famous stunts, and did one of the most impressive dances in screen history where he popped balloons while tap dancing-yet he's remembered for making faces and running into a wall during ""Make 'Em Laugh"".Still, as much as I've just dissed Singin' in the Rain, the movie does have it's good parts. As a kid, I didn't like this movie and actually got rid of my DVD copy, but when I grew up and went to film school, I grew a new appreciation for it. I learned that there was a time when movies were made without sound and that the adding of the element was often difficult for actors and crewmen to adjust to. Kids don't know these things, so when an entire scene is devoted to Jean Hagen's inability to change her lowlife accent into a cultured one, they don't care. When the actors learn they can't move their face away from the microphone, kids don't care or understand. When actors lip-synch and loop their own dialogue, kids are bored and wondering when they can go outside and play. But film students will definitely get a kick out of it.Gene Kelly and Jean Hagen are silent movie stars in the 1920s, and the tongue-in-cheek salute to the silent era is very amusing. With the advent of sound, they each face challenges to keep their jobs and their adoring public. Also, Gene clashes with a hopeful starlet, Debbie Reynolds, who ends up dubbing Jean's speaking and singing voice. Interestingly enough, Debbie's singing voice was dubbed by Betty Noyes. She also wasn't nearly as marvelous a dancer as her costars, and during rehearsals, she reportedly cowered under the piano crying because it was too difficult to live up to Gene Kelly's standards. One has to wonder why she was kept on in the cast-or why she was cast in the first place-and if she showed such unprofessional behavior on the set, why she continued to have a career. In case you can't tell, I'm not a Debbie Reynolds fan; she's ruined for me almost everything she's been in.When all's said and done, this movie is a classic and a staple in old musical viewings. You're going to want to see this one. It has cute songs, like ""Moses Supposes"" and ""You Are My Lucky Star"" and classic dance numbers. If you've seen Donald O'Connor running into a wall, Gene Kelly posing next to a lamppost, or the three leads toppling over a couch, those famous clips are from this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
The titular song is still stuck in my head,"""Singin' In The Rain"" is a 1952 musical romance directed by Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly starring him and Debbie Reynolds. I think I speak in the name of countless when I say that two of the most important factors in my life are my passion for movies and my love for music. Not only do I happen to be a passionate stage actor and musician myself, both have played a major role since I was a kid and there's nothing more moving for me than the rawest and purest output of emotions. That's why I think that I was literally born for the genre musical - in both watching and performing. In any way, having witnessed this classic was a revelation for me. From the first minute on, it grabbed me on a deep emotional level. There's no actor or actress in this feature whose ability to act, dance or sing isn't absolutely masterful. Kelly and Reynolds pretty much dominated the screen with their absolutely heartwarming chemistry. It's a colourful piece or art that perfectly manages to amaze the audience with it's uplifting story that realistically depicts a time in the history of cinema when talking films were said to never make it in Hollywood - and at the same time subliminally criticises it. It's a touching story that perfectly balances well written and crafted scenes or dialogue and drama with ingenious and non-repetitive musical numbers. They all fit so well in the atmosphere of their respective scenes and (except for one in the end) had me on the edge of my seat and in a form of indescribable ecstasy. What I experienced there was classic acting at it's finest. The songs and musical score are absolutely loveable and unforgettable and the titular number has been stuck in my head for hours since I watched it. The magnificent camera work enables the viewer to literally live every scene on such a close level that everyone who feels in a bad mood before watching it will feel immensely better afterwards. It's the sheer amount of talent and the perfectionist directorial style of the director duo that make this film almost reach perfection and so much inspiring in so many ways. All in all, it's outstanding as it is iconic, still untouchable and the forerunner for every musical that comes after. Even in modern standards this one still beats every film in direct competition. I'm pretty sure that when you look up the term ""musical"" in a lexicon you will find an image of Gene Kelly dancing around a streetlight pool and singing one of the most famous numbers of all time. No matter how I felt today, I can't help but repeat what he's singing over and over again. It cheered me up and made me see rain in a way more positive way. ""I'm dancing ... and singing in the rain."" - and literally feel this. Thank Hollywood this films exists!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
There is actually more to the movie than Gene Kelly's stroll down the pluvial sidewalk.,"Obviously, everyone remembers Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) dancing down the street while it's raining. In case anyone's forgotten the plot, it's about the arrival of sound in Hollywood and how it destroyed some people's careers due to their voices. So, Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) - who has a scratchy voice - has to get dubbed by Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) - who has a beautiful voice. Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) provides some comic relief.The idea that this innovation ruined some people's careers...that actually has some relevance to the present. Every time that there's some innovation, it shortens our attention spans. The radio, TV, even the Internet...they have all shortened our attention spans. Whereas once we had to use our imaginations about everything and/or go out and experience life a little more, we can now just do everything from home.Oh, well. I guess that there's nothing that we can do about that. I guess that all that we can do is watch ""Singin' in the Rain"" and wait for Gene Kelly to explain ""what a glorious feeling"" it is.

Hagen is a stitch as the Noo Yawky cartoon-voice afflicted shrew co-star of Kelly in their ascent to stardom.

Possibly the best movie musical of all time,"It's between ""The Sound of Music"" and ""Singin' in the Rain"" for the best movie musical, in my opinion. It's difficult to choose, but this might be it. This film proves to be so funny that it could make a great comedy on its own. However, the songs really add something to the story and now I can't imagine the film without them. In an Oscar-nominated performance, it is Jean Hagen that cracks me up the most and really steals the show. She can't sing and act, but she can certainly make an audience laugh. Watching the three main stars (Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, and Debbie Reynolds) sing ""Good Morning"" is one of my favorite moments of the film, not to mention Kelly's ""Singin' in the Rain"" scene being one of the most famous moments on film.

"""Round tones, Miss LaMont, round tones...""","This is near-blasphemy, but I would love ""Singin' in the Rain"" even more than I do if it were a non-musical, or, more to the point, a musical with different music. Gene Kelly's talent is incontrovertible, and sequences such as the lengthy ""Broadway Rhythm"" number underscore his (and Stanley Donen's) remarkable vision and talent.They also hold up this snappy, bright, FUNNY comedy.Which is not to say that all of the musical portions are not entertaining adjuncts to the film; the ""Beautiful Girls"" fashion show is hysterically camp, and of course, Kelly's solo ""Singin' in the Rain"" is charming, romantic and joyous. However, the screenplay is so solid on its own, the lesser moments (""Good Morning,"" ""You Were Meant for Me"") seem to drag on forever.Kelly is movie star handsome here, befitting his role as silent screen lover, Don Lockwood. Donald O'Connor is fine as the ubiquitous funny man sidekick, while Debbie Reynolds displays a nice, sassy touch, especially in her first scene. ""Here we are, Sunset and Camden,"" she trills, having just deflated the ego of one of Hollywood's most notorious wolves. She's a much more interesting romantic foil than most of the colorless ingenues which grace male-dominated musicals.But the real scene-stealer is the extraordinary Jean Hagen, as shrill-voiced screen queen Lina LaMont. It is such a bravura performance, she simply blows the competition off the screen. Never once does she break character. Her slow burns and takes as she reacts to other characters' comments and actions are almost as funny as her (numerous) quotable lines. ""I...can...SEEWWWW."" ""People?! I ain't PEOPLE! I'm a...'shining, shimmering star in the Hollywood firmament.' See? Sez so, right there!"" ""I CAN'T make LOVE to a BUSH!"" ""Gee, this wig weighs a ton!

A tremendous talented trio lead a superb plot,"Who couldn't like ""Singin' in the Rain?"" Even these decades after it was made in 1952 - at the height of Hollywood's golden era, this film still entertains audiences, old and young. Gene Kelly, Donald, O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds are sure to sing and dance their way into the hearts of audiences for many more decades. The sheer talent in the three leads makes this one of the liveliest musicals of all time. All three sing and dance, and the full cast join in for superb choreographed numbers. Kelly and O'Connor have original and unique routines that are among their best. The film has more than a dozen songs, including hit tunes from Broadway and several earlier musical films of the Golden Era.To package this exceptional ensemble of entertainment, the producers wrapped it in a scintillating plot. The setting is Hollywood in 1928. The glamorous stars, the top director, the studio head and the cast and crew of a fictional big name studio are in a stew over what to do. Sound pictures are being made. Many put them down but the studio head foresees trouble. Then, Warner Brothers releases ""The Jazz Singer,"" and overnight, audiences clamor for more sound. The era of silent films is about to end, and a new motion picture industry is born.So, the story provides a fictional look at the big transition period in Hollywood history as well. Then, to top it off, the outstanding writing team of Betty Comden and Adolph Green wrote a humorous screenplay filled with many good laughs and more than a couple of jabs and pokes at the film industry, people in it, and the fans.The entire cast of this film gave top performances. Jean Hagen did a great job playing the sexy idol of the silent screen who wouldn't make the transition to sound. Her voice said it all, and the story is very funny as everyone keeps Lina Lamont from ever speaking. Kelly's Don Lockwood does all the talking. Of course, the film audience knows what the audiences in the picture don't know until the very end. That the great leading lady of silent film really can't sing or even speak well with her squeaky, high-pitched voice. Lamont answers her own question, ""Do you think I'm dumb or somethin'?"" Hagen's real voice is normal and very good, but she plays the ditzy blonde bombshell to a tee.Millard Mitchell is very good as R. F. Simpson, the studio head of Monumental Pictures, and Douglas Fowley is very funny as Roscoe Dexter, the studio's top director. Some of the humor pokes fun at cinema fans when Lockwood and Lamont arrive at an opening night event and fans are lining the streets to catch glimpses of the stars. The young girls scream with delight as Lockwood gets out of their limo with Lamont, and while the police cordon holds back the people, a couple of fawning girls faint. The scenes of Lamont speaking for the first sound picture by the studio are very funny,The capper in this film is a real jab at celebrities and society. The notion that the wealthy and entertainment celebs of this world are the smartest people on any subject, still seems to sway many in the media, politics and the population. After people hear Lina Lamont's real voice, she gets jeers instead of cheers. She then complains to Simpson, ""Whadda they think I am, dumb or somethn'? Why I make more money than...than...than Calvin Coolidge...put together.""This is just top entertainment from start to finish. It's one of the best musicals of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

One of my personal favorites,"Singin' in the Rain is a movie that my Dad has talked to me about for years and when I finally decided to watch it this year I was expecting something that was going to be very campy and really show it's age. Boy, was I wrong. Singin' in the Rain is one of the greatest song and dance musicals ever to be put on the big screen and is just a feel good movie.

A fantastic musical,"Even though I am not a musical fan, i found this film enjoyable because of the up beat attitude that the characters have. the storyline is easy to follow and the film included music that can be up lifting. The acting was decent but the dancing and singing from the actors and actresses was tremendous. Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor seemed as if they had been lifelong friends before the movie was made and that made that aspect of the movie believable. As a director, Gene Kelly did a beautiful job putting together the different aspects such as choreography, music, singing, and acting. the film is a classic musical that is rightfully considered one of the best movies of its gene.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Swingin' in the rain,"I can't gainsay this classic musical its status as one of Hollywood's very best, although I do have one or two issues with it which stop me giving it an even higher mark. On the plentiful plus side are the wonderful dance numbers, particularly the iconic title piece, but also Donald O'Connor's brilliant solo ""Make 'em Laugh"", the golly-gosh niceness of ""Good Morning"" and of course the celebrated ""Broadway Melody"" finale, the often overlooked very witty and funny screenplay which brilliantly satirises the traumatic transition time in Hollywood from ""Silents"" to ""Talkies"" and some fine acting performances, if not by the leads.I admit to something of a problem with Kelly, he's no great singer and his lantern-jawed acting often distinctly smells of ham, but a great choreographer and dancer he undoubtedly was and he's never better than here. I did find Debbie Reynolds too young and winsome for her part as Kelly's love interest and it's a pity her character's initial feistiness is watered down as the film progresses, but her personality still shines through more than enough. Donald O'Connor I do like in his supporting part as Kelly's side-kick, even if he does seem at times to be a mini-me Danny Kaye, but it's Jean Hagen who steals the acting plaudits with her sub Judy Halliday routine as the screechy, back- stabbing Lina Lamont - you'll be saying ""I caint stain 'im"" for hours afterwards.The film is bright, colourful, musical but most of all very funny and can deservedly be celebrated as one of the best musicals ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Singing in the rain is a Farce,"The whole premise of this movie is to give credit to people like Marni Nixon and others who were never listed in the credits for the great movies they dubbed--You are NOT hearing the voice of Debbie Reynolds in these songs, her voice was dubbed --Sometimes the very woman who she was supposed to be dubbing was in fact dubbing her--The movie was over hyped and what was actually occurring was kept very hush hush when it came out for viewing==Debbie Reynolds' voice was dubbed by Betty Royce for the scenes where Reynolds' character dubs Lina Lamont's singing and speaking voice. And in one scene were Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) is dubbing Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), Hagen is actually dubbing Reynolds dubbing Hagen on screen for just one line.==",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

The reds, greens, yellows, and in-betweens, all cascading in magnificent procession. And what about those unbelievably agile dance routines - I'm still trying to catch my breath. And here's hoping Kelly and O'Connor got extra pay for those magnificent moves. I guess my only gripe is that the leggy Charrise didn't get more exposure time amid the other leggy chorines.

Shouldn't be ruined by a remake,"Singn' in the rain is an unforgettable musical that still entertains people today.It is based in the year 1927 when talkie movies come in and one film company is struggling to get their movies right and try to dub their squeaky-voiced actress.When one of the actors named Don falls into a car when trying to escape from fans he meets a woman who mistakes him for a robber and he has to explain to her that he is a famous actor.

The scenes had great movement in the camera part and the shot were great and didn't expect it to be so good for the 50s to be honest. The colours of their clothing and sets where espectacular , i loved how they tapped danced with the music they were singing nothing like the musicals nowadays with a lot of autotune this was just wonderful, i loved how they used the scenography with the dance sequel so perfectly also the scenography just the art department had espectacular paintings like real theatre and the places filmed too, how they used sets in the movie because the plot line which i really liked, they started showing us film in the time with no audio, just they making faces and corporal acting, then the discovering of pictures with the talking and how they started using the microphone, they showed us how it is in the industry to make films and how the departments work so hard and also the actors, the production of it all.

A Clever Charming Film,"I love old classic movies, silent movies, really anything from the late nineteenth to mid twentieth centuries. I have seen what this film was trying to emulate and I congratulate it for being such a success.My complaint is that while the film emulates the transition from silent films to talkies well, it does not make a great enough movie to justify being lauded as such a critically acclaimed period piece. The story, while creative, is wafer thin because it is really a twenty minute sketch that is spread out to an entire feature film. The majority of songs were not original to this film, which isn't bad in it of itself, but by deciding to place their own songs in the soundtrack the creators unwittingly created a battle between their songwriter's skills and the skills of already successful songs. And the songs which were created for this film, (Moses Supposes) are neither interesting, catchy, or fun. There were many fun dances, but unfortunately the camera had to keep rolling until it became a punishment to the viewers.The humor was one of the only purely great parts. I enjoyed the joking, the comedy, the acting. This aspect was fine.The cinematography I feel was trying to mainly emulate late twenties and early thirties films in how much it feels like this is only filmed on a singular stage, maybe this is because of the Broadway play, but I'll give them credit for designing cinematography.The color theory displayed in the film was actually superb. It is vibrant and popping, which might hurt the fact that it is supposed to be a twenties period piece, but who cares?My main problem with the film is the music, which wouldn't normally matter, but as this is a musical I feel that I have to be critical. West Side story rules.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Musicals Aren't For Everyone,"Listen, I am not a fan of musicals. It just isn't my thing. However, due to a film class we were forced to watch Singin' in the Rain (1952). I'm not going to say it was great or even good, but I could tell why it was a classic. It has the great actors, great voices, and a pretty good story line. I went into the film not expecting much comedy but came out laughing at certain scenes. Jean Hagen's character is funny the entire length of the movie and is a really underrated piece I believe. You can say that she is the center of the movie and what the plot centers on. The singing is okay, typical 1940s/50s corny stuff. This movie is certainly a pioneer for the musical genre but not something everyone will get on board with.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
At Best Silly Reputation Larger Than Itself,"When it was released in 1952, Singin In The Rain was seen as just another musical and forgotten without much consideration. However, like Citizen Kane, in the next decade or so it suddenly shot up in terms of adulation. It is now widely regarded as the greatest musical and one of the most enduring films ever made. Now, I must make it clear that I'm not a fan of musicals. In fact, I never saw one I enjoyed.Like films such as Star Wars or The Lord Of The Rings or any fantasy/alternate world set films, musicals aren't meant to be viewed as reality. Nobody solves their problems by jumping around and singing as they do in this film. And this film requires a viewer to suspend their disbelief and go with it. But even if you do there isn't much there. The plot is no more than a wisp and the other cast members' purpose only seems to be supporting Gene Kelly. Which only leaves you with the numbers. And it's not like there wasn't any good music at the time, the problem is it just wasn't getting put into this film.Singin In The Rain is silly to say the least and has grown a reputation much larger than itself. I only hesitate from giving it a lower rating because I don't want to completely judge off of personal taste.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Most likely the best musical ever filmed, although I sure like ""Cats"" and ""A Chorus Line"" too!.","""Singing In The Rain"" is unique in that the song actually inspired the movie. It is set in Hollywood in the mid-1920s. Gene Kelly, 39 when it was made, stars as Don Lockwood, silent film star. Donald O'Connor was 26, played Cosmo Brown, Lockwood's long-time sidekick. And 19-yr-old Debbie Reynolds, in already her 6th film, plays Kathy Seldon, aspiring legitimate (stage) actress set on going to NYC. Lockwood met her initially when he was escaping overzealous fans and leaped into her car from a streetcar top. Also, they later met again when she jumped out of a cake at a party. She obviously needed work!However, the character who really makes the whole story possible, and the movie fantastic, is Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), Lockwood's silent screen co-star, who also happens to be a totally self-absorbed person with the most irritating voice possible. Hagen is absolutely perfect in this role, and I understand she received an Oscar nomination for it.   In 1927, the first ""talkie"", ""The Jazz Singer"" with Al Jolson, changed movies forever. Suddenly the ""talkies"" were making all the money and the Lockwood/Lamont team had to follow or close down. No amount of diction coaching could get Lamont to sound good, and the audience could only laugh at the test screening just 6 weeks before scheduled opening. Cosmo had a great idea - Kathy would dub in her voice over Lina's. Also, the serious ""Dueling Cavaliers"" would become a musical, ""The Dancing Cavaliers.""The new musical is a big hit, Lina gets coerced by the live audience to sing a song, but it was Kathy singing behind the curtain. Midway through it, they raised the curtain to expose the truth, Lina was put in her place, and the new team of Lockwood and Selden was a hit, on and off the big screen.Except for an extended surreal dance scene with Kelly and Cyd Charisse, which seemed to break the continuity of the story, the movie is almost perfect. I rate it ""9"" of 10. Of course Kelly was choreographer, and co-director, so I suppose he just wanted that number in. The several energetic dance numbers with Kelly and O'Connor are simply great, as are the two individual solo numbers, ""Singing in the Rain"" by Kelly, right after Don leaves Kathy's apartment, realizing he is in love with her, and ""Make 'Em Laugh"" by O'Connor, which includes his running up two different inclining walls and back-flipping off them.Who knew Debbie Reynolds could dance so well, and hold her own with Kelly and O'Connor??  Well, she couldn't until she was cast for the part, and she literally worked herself to bleeding feet in rehearsing for the production numbers, and all her hard work shows. She became a dancer for this role.I love music, and I love good dancing. I cannot watch a film like this without mentally comparing the two great dancers of 1950s film, Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire. I suppose Astaire was the greater ""pure dancer"" of the two, with always perfect positions and movements that would just glide over the floor.  Kelly, however, is my overall favorite of the two. Not only is he a superb dancer, his more athletic build and dancing style, combined with good looks and singing voice, make him more believable in the musical film roles they both starred in.",,Anonymous,Romance

It's a beautifully shot, beautifully choreographed film with tons of humor and warmth.It's the cinematic equivalent of a bowl of chocolate ice cream; no matter how upset or tired you may be, this film will always perk you up.

"Singin in the Rain is a classic, and deserves to be watched over and over","There is no movie musical more fun than ""Singin' in the Rain,"" and few that remain as fresh over the years. Its originality is all the more startling if you reflect that only one of its songs was written new for the film, that the producers plundered MGM's storage vaults for sets and props, and that the movie was originally ranked below ""An American in Paris,"" which won a best picture Oscar. The verdict of the years knows better than Oscar: ""Singin' in the Rain"" is a transcendent experience, and no one who loves movies can afford to miss it. The film is above all lighthearted and happy. The three stars--Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and 19-year-old Debbie Reynolds--must have rehearsed endlessly for their dance numbers, which involve alarming acrobatics, but in performance they're giddy with joy. Kelly's soaking-wet ""Singin' in the Rain"" dance number is ""the single most memorable dance number on film,"" Peter Wollen wrote in a British Film Institute monograph. I'd call it a tie with Donald O'Connor's breathtaking ""Make 'em Laugh"" number, in which he manhandles himself like a cartoon character. Kelly and O'Connor were established stars when the film was made in 1952. Debbie Reynolds was a newcomer with five previous smaller roles, and this was her big break. She has to keep up with two veteran hoofers, and does; note the determination on her pert little face as she takes giant strides when they all march toward a couch in the ""Good Morning"" number. Kelly and O'Connor had dancing styles that were more robust and acrobatic than the grandmaster, Fred Astaire. O'Connor's ""Make 'em Laugh"" number remains one of the most amazing dance sequences ever filmed -- a lot of it in longer takes. ""Good Morning"" uses the kitchen and living areas of Lockwood's house (ironically, a set built for a John Gilbert movie). Early in the film, Kelly climbs a trolley and leaps into Kathy's convertible. Outtakes of the leap show Kelly missing the car on one attempt and landing in the street.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

The colors were amazing which made this movie very interesting to watch. The love story was complicated but not so much that it didn't make sense. The thing that I most enjoyed were the dance routines. I have never seen dancing like that before. Even the minor characters could dance, like the ""make em laugh"" song. Even if you aren't a big fan of musicals, this is one that anyone can enjoy and it is obvious why it is a great American classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Heartwarming Musical Classic About Unexpected Love!,"In one of the earlier films that Hollywood has made about itself, there is no other adjective that can be used to describe 1952's Singin' in the Rain except for delightful. When Gene Kelly stepped outside, oblivious to the rain, to joyfully declare his love for a gal, a big smile arose on my face. This lamppost scene is an iconic scene that every movie lover knows about. I have no idea why it took me so long to see the movie, but better late than never! For one hour and forty-three minutes, I was in a state of joy watching Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, and Debbie Reynolds work their magic. Considering this an Arthur Freed production, you are pretty much guaranteed that there will be great music, lavish sets/costumes, and pitch-perfect dance choreography. The music certainly wasn't new (as most of them were older Freed songs), but the song versions from this movie are certainly the most memorable. When I think about the title song, ""Singin' in the Rain,"" I think about Gene Kelly singing it. The successful usage of the songs is impressive in my eyes because they were written two decades earlier, so they were not related to the actual story. Freed just wanted to make a movie that connected the backlog of songs he created. He hired Betty Comden and Adolph Green to be the connective tissue (writing the script) for the songs.Freed wanted Stanley Donen to direct and Gene Kelly to star, but they were busy working on the 1951 Oscar-winning An American in Paris. Once their schedules cleared up, they were sent the script. Donen and Kelly were both enthusiastic and began to revise the script with their own inputs. Donen was ready to show off the state-of-the-art Technicolor that still looks impressive today. The production design and costumes were vibrant with the colors as everything is bright and jumps at you on the screen. The sound is also very good and it benefits from being an MGM musical. The songs that were performed were written by Freed decades earlier, right around the time talkies were the new thing in Hollywood, so they made sense to use. Some songs were original such as the Donald O'Connor scene-stealing song, ""Make Em' Laugh.""This movie takes place in Hollywood as The Jazz Singer was making rounds as the movie that revolutionized cinema. This changed the acting profession for better or worse. People like Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) are able to adapt because of a vaudeville background. Lockwood and his best friend, Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) team up with the gorgeous actress Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) to form a successful acting tandem. When Lockwood escaped from a gaggle of fans, he met an aspiring actress with a beautiful voice, Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds). Lamont is having trouble with the film transition because of her sharp voice. Lockwood and Cosmo made a decision to dub her voice using Kathy. When Lamont finds out about this, she becomes jealous and angry. The truth will be discovered when Kathy decides to sing for an audience.The cast has such great chemistry with one another. In a way, that is surprising because Gene Kelly (who also co-directed the movie) worked the 19-year-old Reynolds very, very hard. She was an inexperienced dancer and she was forced to keep dancing until her feet bled. She became friends with Fred Astaire who taught her how to dance. I think she danced very well especially given who she was dancing with. Donald O'Connor had an intense, complicated sequence during ""Make Em' Laugh,"" which is one of my favorite sequences. He was a man who smoked four packs of cigarettes a day and had to be hospitalized because this scene wore him out. Gene Kelly stuns with his flawless choreography. I thought An American in Paris was just a bit overrated, but Kelly was the reason why the film worked. He had a more agreeable story to work with and talented co-stars, but he still was the star of the show with his voice and dancing talents.Singin' in the Rain is a film that ages like fine wine. People discover and fall in love with the film many, many years after it was released. It is a top-tier musical that features lots of A-talent on the top of their game. As a romantic comedy, it is an endearing one with fantastic chemistry between Kelly and Reynolds. Who needs umbrellas when you are celebrating love in the rain? There is such a warmth that Donen and the cast delivers and you instantly feel it. So many musicals and romantic comedies try to emulate this movie. Some come close, many do not. If there is a fault, it has to be predictability. That, however, is a fault of the genre. This is about the best you can get...with the addition of some excellent songs.My Grade: A.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Now everybody knows the songs aren't original but the dance numbers are great, even the ones that you would think were less prominent (i.e. Make 'em Laugh) are better than most musical's best numbers and Donald O'Connor really steals the show with this one in my opinion.

"Calculated, pleasant time-waster for the masses.","This musical was built around the title song. It was calculated to please the masses, and it does. The three leads all turn in fabulous performances, with some of the best dance moves by O'Connor, and some of the finest singing by Reynolds. Of course the best all around singing and dancing is by Gene Kelley, especially performing the title song. You would probably have to have been living under a rock to have been born in the 20th Century and not seen that scene at some point. Noteworthy in that and many other scenes are the long, continuous takes of song- and-dance numbers. They are beautifully shot with no cuts to interrupt the flow. Ultimately, the film is little more than a bunch of dance numbers with a corny plot to string them together. If that's good enough for you - you'll love it.

Among the most iconic Hollywood musicals,"""Singin' in the Rain"" is one of the most highly praised American films of all time, regularly appearing on critics' top ten lists. It tells the story of a group of film-makers and stars circa 1927 making the awkward transition from silent to 'talkie' pictures.The film is basically a celebration of the well received MGM musicals that had been appearing for about 25 years at that point. Almost all of the songs featured in the film originated from earlier films. Actually, the story was built around the songs, which is sometimes evident in the tenuous associations given by the script.Nevertheless, the story is quite interesting as it revisits the period of transition between silent and talking pictures, showing some of the difficulties encountered along the way. The romantic subplot is a bit more pedestrian but, on the whole, the story is both joyous and satisfying.Whatever the material, the cast certainly left little room for improvement. You couldn't ask for a better leading man than Gene Kelly for what is arguably the definitive MGM musical. He's well suited to the role of movie star Don Lockwood and his singing & dancing are as good as ever. Nineteen year old Debbie Reynolds was as cute as a button while holding her own with both Kelly and Donald O'Connor, who was no slouch himself. Meanwhile, Jean Hagen snagged an Oscar nomination for what is easily the film's best comedic performance. Also notable were Millard Mitchell as the studio head and Cyd Charisse as a featured dancer.Another of the film's high points is the technical aspect. The co-direction by Gene Kelly & Stanley Donen is top notch and provides us with several memorable moments. The ""Broadway Melody Ballet"" portion of the film is particularly ambitious and breath-taking, while Gene Kelly's rendition of ""Singin' in the Rain"" is legendary. And let's not forget the sumptuous Technicolor photography.All things considered, ""Singin' in the Rain"" has to be regarded as one of the best movies in the musical genre. While there are a few Hollywood musicals that I would rank above it, there's no denying that the movie is a joy to behold and that it still holds up surprisingly well today.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

It shows this generation changing in different ways. The first one is this changing offers more chance for those new movie actors who has an attractive voice. The second one is the changing on the movie editing. Because the editing for a sound movie is different from a silent movie. editor can use a lot of fantastic edit ways to shape a silent movie, such as thematic montage and classical cutting. But when they edit a sound movie, they have to pay attention to the sound track with the actions. It is a challenge that editing those shots in previous editing ways and also keeping the continuity of the sound track. So in this movie, I see a lot of long shot or so called ""sequence shot"". The third changing is the dialog. In the silent movie, this almost no dialog. That's why in this movie, when the actor said:"" I love you, I love you, I love you"", the audiences didn't like it. Then it changes the dialog. The new dialog becomes metrical and meaningful. This movie is a good movie because it shows the revolution for the movie production. And the result is this new technique helps to make movie production better.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
stinky in the rain,The music in this is awful. The story line is awful. The singing is awful. The acting is awful. This movie is just campy and awful. This a very bad movie. Why did is get an 8.3. This is just overrated crap. I give 1 out 10 because it is a pile of pooh pooh. Some do a play were singing. And the lead part is woman I can not sing. So they get her lip sync to another woman who can not sing. She sings a little better. But not mush. There is a scene were a woman is wearing a dress that look like toilet paper. That proves that this is a crappy movie. Do not see this movie. Do not wast your time. And do not wast your money. This movie is awful.,1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great Entertainment,"With an entertaining story, interesting characters, a good cast, and song sequences that are often both lavish and creative, this has everything you could ask for in a musical.  Besides being one of the best musicals ever made, it is also one of the best of the movies that Hollywood has ever made about itself.The story is a somewhat exaggerated and very amusing look at Hollywood as it underwent the transition from silents to sound.  The main characters are defined nicely, and the cast does a fine job with them.  The trio of Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, and Donald O'Connor really look as if they are having a good time together.  It gets a lot of mileage out of even the simplest aspects of the changes that sound pictures brought, and while the main plot is fairly simple, there are plenty of laughs.  Most of the musical numbers work quite well, although the rest of the movie is so good that it probably could have stood up pretty well on its own anyway.This classic is great entertainment, and a movie you can enjoy whether or not you usually like musicals.",,Anonymous,Romance
Didn't expect to like it as much as I do,"Being from the generation that grew up in the 1980's, I missed out on the golden age of Hollywood, both the studio system heyday, and the second golden age, the 1970's.

Wonderfully entertaining musical comedy,"Masterpiece of the musical genre, complete with hilarious slapstick silliness, a sweet romance, dazzling song and dance numbers, and amazing acrobatics.This is one of those movie where Hollywood laughs at itself; a nostalgic glance at the dawn of the ""talkies,"" in the late '20's. That innovation turned the film industry up-side-down, as studios hastily but ineptly scrambled to give audiences a taste of this new cinematic toy. Some of the funniest bits are when actors, with bulky mics stuffed in their clothes make loud brushing noises as they embrace, or the sound goes in and out, or you can literally hear the actor's heart beating! They also had no idea how to script dialog, and the resulting overdone melodramatic corn is hilarious too. ""Yes! Yes! Yes! No! No! No! I love you! I love you! I love you!"" Delightfully idiotic nonsense. Also some actors' careers disappeared, because they had bizarre voices or accents. This is represented by Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), who makes a hilarious, nasal-voiced villainous.Classic routines by Donald O'Connor (Make 'em Laugh), and Gene Kelly (Singin' in the Rain), plus wonderful singing by Debbie Reynolds, and you have one of, if not the best, musical ever made. My only nitpicking objection is the ""Broadway Melody"" routine goes on too long, and seems disconnected from the rest of the movie--perhaps included only to give Kelly an extra opportunity to dance.That minor excess aside, this movie remains one of the fun movies to recite lines from and to watch and enjoy again and again.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Singin' in the rain will make you laugh, sing and dance with the film!!","Singin' in the Rain is a musical romantic comedy film directed by Late Gene Kelly and Late Stanley Donen. The film stars Late Gene Kelly, Late Donald O'Connor, Late Debbie Reynolds, Late Jean Hagen and Late Millard Mitchell.Don and Lina are accomplished silent film actors who have often worked together, however with the rise of Talkies cinema they are forced to make their upcoming film a musical film and they had to bring Kathy Selden to dub the excruciatingly laughable shrill voice of Lina.One of the best and probably the perfect musical romantic comedy films that i've ever seen. The film has a perfect blend of some of the lovely songs, superb acting and is nicely supported by the perfect amount of humor, some great dialogues and is accrued together to make a perfectly balanced Rom-Com.The story of the film is good and the execution is superb.

One of the best musicals ever.,"This film is, for me, the second best musical film of all time, only being surpassed by ""The Sound of Music"". The story is based on a real fact: the rise of sound cinema and the consequences it has brought to an endless number of actors and actresses, whose bad voice or diction wouldn't allow their career to continue. The film stars Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds and Jean Hagen, who bring to life a love triangle that supports the entire film. The script is extraordinary and doesn't deserve critical, as well as the cast performance. Kelly and Reynolds solidified their stardom with this film, in all fairness, for they are amazing together and excellent when separated. Jean Hagen gives life to some of the film's most hilarious moments. As far as music and songs are concerned, they are truly beautiful and some of them are in the ear. It is not by chance that most of the songs in this film have gone to the history of cinema and have become as immortal as the movie itself.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

You'll be walking down the lane with a happy refrain!!!,"Singin in the Rain is perhaps the greatest movie musical ever made. I absolutely just love this film. It combines music, dance and a really witty script to make the most magnificent of MGM's musicals.  The story goes like this: Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are the toast of 1920's Hollywood. Then The Jazz Singer comes out and all hell breaks loose when they realize that talkies are going to be the next big thing. Unfortunately, Lina has a voice that could shatter a mirror and caaaiiint seem to get anything done when a microphone is present. Don't worry though; Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) saves the day and knocks Don right off his feet. She promises to dub over Lina's voice and stay at the back of the cameras. Of course while Lina believes the press that Don and her are an item, Don is falling in love with the beautiful Kathy. All of the stars put in brilliant performances, especially Donald O'Connor, his Make em Laugh' scene has to be one of the best-choreographed displays ever. Jean Hagen's portrayal of the shrill blond bombshell is absolutely hilarious, which won her a Best Supporting Actress nomination that year. And of course the multi-talented Gene Kelly: he can act, sing, and dance the triple threat.  It still amazes me how Gene Kelly was also able to choreograph and co-direct while taking on the role of the main character. Debbie Reynolds is great too, but in my opinion she plays second fiddle to Ms. Hagen. My favorite bit would have to be the trademark Singin in the Rain scene. Just watching Gene Kelly sing and dance around in the streets while it is pouring rain is just wonderful.  This is a great film and I recommend it to everybody.  If you haven't seen Singin in the Rain then you must go see it, if you already have seen it then watch it again, and for those who don't think highly of musicals; this one is a must for you guys cause it will change the way you view musicals.",,Anonymous,Romance
unequivocally the best American musical-comedy out of (and about) the Hollywood Golden age,"Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly's Singin' in the Rain embraces conventions and self-reflection like it's the most wonderful things that can be accomplished with a musical-comedy. It's knowing so well of everything that made up the Hollywood musical- and the bumpy transition from silent film to sound- and always gives a wink and a nod while retaining as a form of pure cinema, in a sense, by giving into its gleeful archetypes. It's also, surprisingly, very smart and witty for a comedy, with its goofy and cornball moments well earned thanks to the earnest effort put into looking so effortless and totally fantastical. It's a fantastical sensibility that can only come out of the movies, the escapism of smitten romances, eccentric characters, and a more contemporary spirit than one might expect (one ends up laughing at how risqué the humor can get, and how guiltlessly silly). And ultimately, it breaks ground, like Citizen Kane, using all of the songs, tricks and superlative technical additives at the disposal of the artists to make a film/amalgam a marvel on all fronts. To put it in a more direct way, if you don't feel happy once this movie ends, it may be time to hit up the the doctors for some heavy medication.The story is like a double-edged sword, where the world of film-making and musicals get their just due in being revealing and reveling in the history of it all. Two movie stars (Kelly and Jean Hagen) of the silent era on high acclaim, who really shouldn't be together, get put to the task of there being a new medium: the sound picture, where people need to talk into the microphone, big physical acts and motions of the grandiose don't quite fit, and the dialog needs to make sense- through strong voices. After a disastrous test screening, a new plan is hatched- that the leading lady, the wonderfully high-strung and ""dumb"" Linda, be dubbed over from her squeaky voice to the impeccable voice of Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds). Adding in the musical sequences, and tweaking it a bit, make it a total hit, but at what cost? This is the broad stroke of the story, anyway, but there's much more to Singin' in the Rain than the usual double-crossings and cynicism to the Hollywood ""dream factory"".All the humanity that the principle characters feel, be it humor (""Make em Laugh"" is a classic number), or in love (the sweet song behind the Dali-esquire set behind Kelly and Reynolds), or in just enjoying what the world has to offer ala ""Good Morning""), gets expressed through song and music, with the title song given a classic form of song and dance expression- as elsewhere in the film- as the camera gets its chances for going into the vibrant style, but also is patient in just capturing all the music on all fronts. On top of being such a sharply crafted comedy, with practically all of the jokes hitting levels of hilarity few musicals could aspire to today (usually in part to Donald O'Connor's determined comic relief and levity), Kelly creates indelible images of choreography, in painstaking detail of foot-work and in the timing of movement with the characters. This all reaches its nexus in a sequence that's all the more brilliant considering it's not even a filmed scene within the film, but that it's the visualization of the idea behind a musical sequence in the film, as Kelly pitches it to his producers.It's loaded with bits of sensuality one wouldn't expect in a 1950s movie (look at those legs!), and encompassing all of the juicy, delightful bits in the crossroads between Broadway and Hollywood musicals. You can lose yourself in this sequence, and always with a big grin at the proceedings. Even towards the end it doesn't lose sight of its 'movie-ness', yet critiquing the nature of the business amid the magic that comes out of it. So get ready to tap your feet and, if inclined, sing along to what serves as the perennial feel-good movie, a work of popular art that has some serious questions in the subtext and never relents to let the audience have a good time at the absurdity of it all- a master's class in absurdity, artificiality, and a love of all things Golden-Age-Hollywood. Think of it as the musical-comedy side of the coin to the dark film-noir coin of Sunset Boulevard; both question what it is to work and stay pertinent in the Hollywood system, but where one treats Hollywood with tougher satire and darker themes, the other goes the route of everything being so fake that it resembles a reality of a fluffy, knowing and kidding dream. An essential of 50s cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Do feel free to ignore me!,"I'm clearly in the major, major minority. Honestly though, I didn't enjoy this.It's certainly worth noting musicals are probably my least favourite genre, but I'm still more than capable of finding entertainment with them - e.g. 'The Greatest Showman', 'The Sound of Music' and others.'Singin' in the Rain', however, simply didn't connect with me. There's one, maybe two, good songs that I had already heard, while Gene Kelly (Don) is solid fun in the lead role. The premise, minus the music, is actually very interesting, what with the silent film transition era. Given it's a musical, though, they don't delve as deep into that as I wanted.None of the songs, aside from the previously alluded to ""Singin' in the Rain"", landed well with me, I kinda found them a chore to sit through to be frank. Elsewhere on the cast, aside from Kelly, I found Debbie Reynolds (Kathy) alright but Donald O'Connor (Cosmo) a little irritating - he tries too hard, for my liking. Jean Hagen (Lina) is likewise a tad annoying, though that's intentional with her to be fair.I will acknowledge that the film, aesthetically, looks excellent.

"""The new Don Lockwood. He yodels; he jumps around to music!""","Just to get the record straight, I don't really like musicals. Whilst I'm fond of most cinematic genres, the musical has been one to which I have been rather averse. Perhaps it is the sheer absurdity of a character suddenly breaking into song at the most inopportune moment, or maybe it is the films' tendencies to have a flimsy story connecting the numerous song-and-dance numbers. In any case, it is the mark of a truly great musical when it makes me completely forget that I don't really like musicals, and 'Singin' in the Rain' is certainly one example. It must also be telling that, after seeing the film, I spent the rest of the day treading down the rain-soaked paths and singing the title song to myself, and I continued to do this for at least the next three days, even after any traces of precipitation had long-since cleared.Following the great success of 'An American in Paris' a year earlier, 'Singin' in the Rain' was co-directed by Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly, and is set in 1927  appropriately, the year of cinema's transition from silent films to ""talkies."" Don Lockwood (Kelly) is silent cinemas biggest star, featuring in a string of monumental financial successes for Monumental Pictures, usually opposite the glamorous Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), who can't comprehend that Lockwood only acts affectionate towards her for his films' publicity. With the release of 'The Jazz Singer,' every studio is eager to cash-in on the demand for talkies, but Don and Lina find themselves with a problem: Lina's shrill New York accent definitely does not complement her glamorous public image.After their share of difficulties  including one hilarious, trouble-plagued test screening for Don and Lina's new film, ""The Dueling Cavalier""  a possible solution is happened upon. Don's energetic best friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) and pretty, young Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds, just 20 years of age when the film was released) suggest turning the disaster of a movie into a musical  ""The Dancing Cavalier""  with Kathy dubbing all of Lina's dialogue and singing. Of course, not everything goes quite to plan, particularly when the selfish and arrogant Lina finds out about this and tries to have Kathy stripped off all the credit for her excellent work. What sets 'Singin' in the Rain' apart from almost every other musical is the story. Whilst it's obvious that most of the songs were selected well before the plot was formulated  sometimes the musical numbers go off on an unnecessary tangent that is irrelevant to the story  no true fan of cinema can go past a film about Hollywood itself.The actual storyline is genuinely engaging, and Lina turns into quite a loathsome villainess by the end of the film, especially when her selfishness threatens to destroy the career of one so innocent and promising as young Kathy. Gene Kelly is great in the main role, his superb confidence and boyish charm, coupled with flawless singing and dancing skills, helping to make him one of Hollywood's most fondly-remembered stars. Debbie Reynolds was also very good, despite reportedly having a difficult time on set, her underdeveloped dancing skills often incurring Gene Kelly's frustration. Donald O'Connor, who I can't believe I've never heard about before, is absolutely phenomenal throughout, his every appearance funny, energetic and memorable. Likewise, Jean Hagen savours every moment as the dim but influential Lina Lamont, earning an Oscar nominations for her troubles.Of course, the true highlights of ""Singin' in the Rain' are the musical numbers. Whilst very few of the songs are original to the film (for example, the title song was taken from 'Hollywood Revue of 1929'), the use of each is so inspired that they now forever associated with it. I'm not particularly a fan of the slow, romantic love songs, but some of the more lively tunes appealed to me greatly. ""Singin' in the Rain,"" performed by Gene Kelly on a rainswept nighttime street, has now becoming legendary, superbly demonstrating how Don's love for Kathy has eradicated all of his troubles and left him blissfully happy. O'Connor's energetic rendition of ""Make 'Em Laugh,"" in which he somersaults off the walls of a movie set, left him in a state of extreme exhaustion. ""Good Morning,"" a catchy little tune performed by Kelly, O'Connor and Reynolds was also nice to watch. Perhaps the film's centrepiece, Kelly's ""Broadway Melody Ballet"" has little to do with the plot of the film, but it is such an astounding flurry of colour and excitement that I am willing to forgive its running a bit overlong. For fans of musicals, 'Singin' in the Rain' is a treat for the eyes and the ears. Indeed, even for people who have little interest in watching musicals, you shouldn't give up on the genre until you have at least seen this one.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

A good musical number cam be like a soliloquy in ehich the character shares their deepest thoughts through words and movement, however most of the musical numbers in this film were just an excuse to make the lead man tap dance again.The writing wasn't awful but it did come off sometimes like a low rent sitcom that was constantly patting itself on the back, which was kind of fun in places, if largely not great.

There are so many great numbers in the movie aside from the title track ""singing in the rain"".  Debbie Reynolds is terrific as the love interest of Gene Kelly.  The plot of the movie is interesting.  It involves scandle and intrigue and romance.  However, the singing/dancing numbers stand out above all other musicals I have seen.  This movie left me feeling great (which I need from time to time).  I found my face fixed in a grin throughout the entire film.  Few movies have forced my face to contort that way without me realizing it.  Ah, if only there were a way I could go back to that magical time when film noir was more in fasion.

"""Enchanting. What?""","This movie is simply fantastic and certainly has a cushy spot in my top five. Singin' in the Rain was a high-water mark for musicals, and after 1952 there would be few true classics of the genre (just The Band Wagon, Kiss Me Kate, West Side Story and a couple of others). What a pity, especially since Kelly had only been in Hollywood ten years when this was released.But regardless, Singin' in the Rain is a real treat, from the first time to the fiftieth, because this one just keeps getting better every time.Yet I can see how it might seem overrated to some. When I first saw it I had never been very interested in classic film, so phrases like ""best musical of all time"" and ""one of the greats"" certainly weren't running around in my mind. I'd heard of it, it was supposed to be good, so I watched it and I was hooked. Only when I started looking around the net and the library for more information on this gem and it's star did those words pop up. I thought about it and, since by then I'd seen more of the genre, I decided it seemed to fit. So I am now one of the many who regards this as one of the greats. But people who go into it thinking this will have high expectations and will possibly be disappointed.The songs and dances are sheer perfection. I love them all, but my favourite is the Broadway Melody Ballet in which Cyd Charisse slinks around a bewildered Gene Kelly. Incredible. I admit that the rest of the number is a bit lengthy, but it's worth sitting through for Cyd.If you need encouragement beyond the comments on this page, forget it. It will be lost on you. But if you're willing to give it a try, do so, but don't go expecting entertainment that far surpasses anything you have ever seen, or a plot so complex that you have to take notes, but look for cute numbers, likeable characters, and great use of colour.

This is Gene Kelly at his very best and was his best by far but his other films are still good to watch. But let's not forget Donald O'Connor's performance he was just as good but like many others will never be as good as the great Gene Kelly. The songs were catchy and is something that would suck in the audience and make them sing along. Gene Kelly's dance when he sings singin in the rain is just fantastic and leaving me wondering how on earth he can dance like that. Even though Goodfellas is my most favourite movie of all time, i would still have to put singin in the rain up there on my list, but would definitely be my favourite musical as nothing compares to this. It is authentic and has some funny moments in it too but anyone who has not seen this PRETTY PLEASE i beg you to watch this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great in all respects,"Everyone seems to agree that not only is Singin' in the Rain the greatest of Hollywood musicals but one of the best of any kind of movie ever made. That's what I think too. Its plot line of the arrival of movie sound points one inevitably toward one of the greatest comic plays ever written, Kaufmann and Hart's Once in a Lifetime, (1931) written equally hilariously about the same topic. And its reminding us of all the vocal pronunciation coaching that went on in those panic stricken days irresistibly summons up analogies to Eliza Dolittle's language lessons in Shaw's Pygmalion and My Fair Lady.The musical goings on are very hard to focus on in the crediting department. Usually one name in the credits will suffice for a movie composer. But between orchestrators and music directors there are about 15 musicians in the crew list, most of them uncredited, including Johnny Green as music director and Alexander Courage, later of Starwars fame. The lush adaptations, orchestrations, and ballet numbers, all especially written for this movie make it a festival of musical riches, never mind the great songs themselves. I found it strange that Donald O'Conor's ""Make 'Em Laugh"" song never broke into the more familiar words ""Be a Clown"" featured in ""That's Entertainment."" Anyone wanting to read an excellent background book on the whole silent-to-sound transition should read ""The Shattered Silents,"" by Alexander Walker (1978).",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
With a happy refrain,"""Singin' in the Rain"" is a musical that explores the transition from silent to sound films. It also features the story of actor Don Lockwood, who is famous for his on-screen romantic pairing with Lina Lamont. Lina expects Don to marry her, but Don is more interested in Kathy Selden.Gene Kelly, Jean Hagen and Debbie Reynolds are all excellent in the lead roles. Hagen is especially amusing and her screechy voice functions perfectly as an impediment in the transition to sound films.There are not surprisingly a lot of musical numbers, which are generally well-made. Especially good is the title number as sung by Gene Kelly while meandering through a street. The only number that seemed out of place was the extended ""Broadway Melody"" number toward the end of the film, which looks nice, but is disruptive to the flow of the story.The storyline exploring the tumultuous transition from silent to sound films and the relationships between characters were clever and amusing. It helped that I watched ""The Jazz Singer"" (1927) shortly before watching this one, as the film makes reference to its role as the film that ushered in the sound era. It is not essential to view it before seeing this, but it may help to learn of the song ""Mammy"" from that film since some of the jokes in this film make reference to it. ""Singin' in the Rain"" is not my favorite musical, but it is certainly one of the better ones I have seen.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the greatest films of all time,"This is a sparkling film and the best musical of all time. Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen are masters of musical movies and this is the best of the bunch.

Of course it is easy to mention the title routine but no one should forget Donald O'Connor's spectacular ""Make 'em Laugh"" or the lead trio's ""Good Mornin'"".

"I love this film, but...","I think the dance numbers, and even some of the songs, are less amazing than those of its immediate predecessor, An American in Paris, made by gene Kelly a year beforehand. I know that the An American in Paris songs were just adaptations of Gershwin songs, but they're great, and they work. That rendition of ""I Got Music"" is wonderful, and the 20 minute ballet at the end is one of the greatest things I've ever seen in a film. There are several songs from Singing in the Rain which were a little weak, and the ""New York Ballet"" doesn't feel right at all in this film. It's obviously a grab for the success of An American in Paris and its amazing finale. That one made a lot of sense in that film (and was itself inspired by the even more amazing ballet sequence from The Red Shoes). That ballet sequence had much more substance, and didn't seem excessive. The New York Ballet did seem a bit excessive, although nice to watch.What puts Singing in the Rain above An American in Paris is its plot. An American in Paris' plot was almost completely filler material between the songs and dance. The ending to that film (after the ballet sequence, that is) was very abrupt and didn't even make much sense. Singing in the Rain is extremely interesting in its setting. It's very interesting from a historical perspective, and that's what pushes it to a 10/10 for me, 1 above An American in Paris.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Greatest Musical Ever Made? Hell Yeah!,"Reflecting state-of-the-art quality in every filmmaking aspect, jam-packed with wonderful songs, amazing choreography & exquisite use of humour, and depicting the often frustrating process of getting accustomed to something completely new, Singin' in the Rain is the story of a silent film production company which, along with its cast, makes a difficult transition to sound.To be honest, I'm not really a fan of musicals. In fact, I despise live-action musicals but this film has so much charm, charisma & laughter that it manages to make itself work extremely well for the majority of its runtime. Directed by Gene Kelly & Stanley Donen, the film is a hilarious ride from start to finish & puts on screen some of the most exhausting dance sequences ever filmed.The technical aspects deserve a mention too as cinematography includes many moments of long single-takes, fluid camera movements & perfectly captured shots, editing concisely paces the whole story without ever letting any boredom to set in, although that Broadway sequence did feel out of place & unnecessary to me. And last but not the least, many of its songs are instantly catchy & memorable.Coming to the performances, the cast consists of Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds & Jean Hagen, and although Gene & Debbie no doubt share a great on-screen chemistry here, it's Donald O'Connor who ends up impressing the most for he was an absolute show-stealer in every scene and his highly energetic performance easily overshadowed everything else, including Gene Kelly's magnetic work both on & off the screen.On an overall scale, Singin' in the Rain is hailed by many as the greatest musical to come out from Hollywood & I wholeheartedly agree. It certainly has every ingredient that makes a movie great & despite my initial lack of excitement or expectations, it turned out to be such an incredibly fun, hilarious & enjoyable cinematic ride that I'm going to cherish it for a long time. Don't miss it.",,Anonymous,Romance

Now, I have many reasons for this choice. One of which has to be the absolutely fabulous soundtrack. Any movie that can launch a song that thousands of people sing whenever it starts to rain must be absolutely fabulous. Make Him Laugh is likely one of the funniest musical numbers in movie history. Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds are fabulous actors that sell the story wonderfully. And the plot is funny and well written.

The Best Musical Of All Time...,"...and I am not merely saying this because I love it..., I am not saying this because AFI says it, but I have watched this film over and over again since I was six, and I have not been able to forget it. It was mentioned at my theater class a few years ago, and it is by far one of the most colorful musical of all time.Who could incorporate more important songs into one musical like they did here? Unlike many musicals that are coming out not, this was originally a movie. The plot is so beautiful, and the songs just nail it on the head.While the film is long... possibly too long for a young child, it is certainly a movie that should not be watched in two sittings. The splendor of the color and the dance sequences are killed when the film is stopped. Believe me. I know this from experience.The plot is relatively simple. Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lana Lamont (Jean Hagan) are two legendary silent film stars. A young Debbie Reynolds is a great Kathy Selden, a girl who is trying to break into the film business. Lana Lamont (Jean Hagan), who is Don's stage girlfriend, disproves of Kathy's breaking in, because Kathy is winning Don's affection and love. All at the same time, a movie that Don and Lana have made, `The Dueling Caviler' is not safe. Warner Brothers has come out with their first talkie, `The Jazz Singer' and studios are now converting to sound. Not only that, but they must do so, also, in order for the long-awaited film, `The Dueling Caviler' to be a success.So Don, Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) and Kathy decide that the film must be made into a musical, `The Dancing Cavalier'. One problem- Lana's wretched voice. Kathy will have to dub all of Lana's lines and songs without Lana knowing.The film ends with a great finale and all throughout the film the sons are intertwined with great fun.

How musicals should be!,"There are a very small, select number of films, which stand the test of time and will live on forever. One such film is 'Singing in the Rain'. Made in 1952, much of the Hollywood satire found in the film is still relevant to the star system and studio structure of Tinsel Town today. Gene Kelly puts in an unforgettable performance as the all-singing, all-dancing, Don Lockwood.The story follows a group of Hollywood filmmakers, making the transition from the silent movies of yester-year into the new age of talking-film. With a little help from his friends Lockwood turns a terrible formulaic studio picture into a show stopping musical.This is one of those films that everyone should go back to and watch again. It is a fantastic reminder of how the musical genre used to be, and should be! It also struck me as surprisingly historical, charting the introduction of the talking-movies and the initial public and professional reaction to it. Watching this film will remind you of the heart-warming, lifting feeling that many modern films just fail to deliver. If anyone can resist the urge to smile and laugh during Donald O'Connor's fantastic performance of 'Make 'em laugh' then it would be a very sorry day indeed! If it is an achievement to get your audience on the edge of their seat then this film surpasses that achievement because I was very close to dancing on mine!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Mama mama, what a great show!","In late '20s Hollywood, a beautiful but squeaky-voiced star of the silent screen can't adjust when Tinsel Town goes Talkie, yet a disaster is averted when her male co-star has his new girl dub the actress's lines and her singing for their latest costume epic. Glorious musical-comedy is savvy (if a little soft-hearted) about show business, and truly first-rate as a visual feast (with colors that saturate the screen like a painter's dream palette). Though he deserves most of the credit for his co-direction, singing, dancing and choreography, I'm not sure how convincing Gene Kelly is as a love-interest for Debbie Reynolds (they seem more along the lines of close pals, or perhaps brother and sister). Kelly, a real showboater who constantly plays to the camera, knows his strengths like no other musical star, yet his penchant for playing to the audience can either be deemed cute or simply unctuous. Still, the man is a human dynamo, and he cuts quite a presence on the screen; though his elaborate ""Broadway Melody"" number really belongs in a different picture altogether, Kelly is ingratiating calling out ""Gotta Dance!"" to a stage full of arms-flailing teens--he's the bedrock of the movie, as well as its heart and soul. Debbie seems rather young for him, but she's full of joshing good cheer, like a great buddy. Donald O'Connor has energy to spare as a pianist, and his exhausting showpiece ""Make 'em Laugh"" (though prolonged) is one of the few times when Kelly doesn't steal the spotlight. ***1/2 from ****",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
a review of how this film fits into the careers of the stars.,"You don't need a 500+ person to tell you that this film is a classic in terms of the abundance and quality of the music, dancing and comedy, So, I'd like to fill my space with insights into the stars' overall relations and how certain key performances relate to their previous and subsequent films.It's the only film that paired two of the greatest male musical comedy entertainers of that era: Gene Kelly and Don O'Connor. We might wonder why they weren't paired again? Although Gene was a well established MGM star, this was Don's first musical outside his home studio of Universal. He would do another MGM musical the next year: ""I Love Melvin"". Debbie Reynolds again was the romantic lead. Clearly, this film was not given the royal treatment of the present film and is much shorter. But, it gives us an opportunity to see what Don and Debbie could do without Gene and Cyd(quite a lot of fun,too!) Reportedly, working with Gene on the present film was rather a traumatic experience for both Don and Debbie, especially the latter. Gene's extreme perfectionism and egoism was legendary. Nonetheless, nearly all his costars, especially Debbie, improved their dancing and acting by working with him. However, neither Don nor Debbie was anxious to do another film with Gene, and neither did.Debbie was actually an anomaly in Gene's '50s musical comedies. In every other of his last 5 Hollywood musicals beginning in '51, his first choice as his leading lady and main female dance partner was Cyd Charisse. Cyd had been kicking around Hollywood for a decade, mostly as a cameo dance specialist. Gene wanted her to costar in ""An American in Paris"" the previous year, but a pregnancy ruled that out. Of course, she was a conspicuous dance specialist in the present film. She was his leading lady in the much less commercially successful ""Brigadoon"" and ""It's Always Fair Weather"", but declined this role in Gene's last Hollywood musical: ""Les Girls"", as did ""An American in Paris"" costar Leslie Caron. I think they rightly smelled a turkey.I'd like to talk about Don's famous ""Make 'Em Laugh"" solo performance, having seen nearly all his Hollywood musicals. Although there are certainly original features to this madcap performance, you might be interested to know that a number of the main features can be recognized in several of his previous Universal films, from '45-'51. Thus, in ""Top Man"", Don and Peggy Ryan dance with cloth dummies in one scene. In ""Something in the Wind"", he does the bit behind the couch, although without the dummy.In ""Feudin', Fightin'and Fussin'"", he does the terminal plunge through a papery wall after dancing. In ""Double Crossbones"", we see his jumping up on a wall, followed by a backwards flip. Even the tune was essentially recycled from the ""Be a Clown"" Gene Kelly-Judy Garland performance in ""The Pirate""Having also seen nearly all of Gene's Hollywood musical comedies, I'd like to comment on the relation of some of his past and future performances to this film. Back in '44, he costarred in a color film with Rita Hayworth and Phil Silvers, called ""Cover Girl"". Several features of that film have often lead to it being dubbed 'the poor man's ""Singing in the Rain' "". Phil takes the place of Don, as the odd man out in the central romance, but nonetheless an intimate friend of the romantic couple. Rita takes the place of Debbie, being a stage dancer and singer. This threesome do a street dance of joy, sometimes arm in arm, twice, including the parting scene. This somewhat resembles the ""Good Morning"" and threesome ""Singing in the Rain"" scenes in the present film. Also, Gene does a solo street dance with his shadow, somewhat foreshadowing his ""Singing in the Rain"" solo street dance in this film. However, there is a critical mood difference. That 'Alter-Ego' dance was inspired by frustration and apprehension about his future relationship with Rita's character, not by the elation of a new found love, as in the present film.As regards his future films, we see Gene's joyful ""Singing in the Rain"" solo as a model for functionally equivalent solos in his next two musicals: ""It's Always Fair Weather"" and ""Brigadoon"", in the form of the ""I Like Myself"" and ""Almost Like Being in Love"" dances. I find the former performance, done on roller skates, his most challenging and interesting dance. Don, who didn't do solo dances in this context in his prior Universal musicals, did a functionally similar new love-inspired performance in the first portion of his long ""I Wanna Wander"" performance in MGM's ""I Love Melvin"", and his classy ""A Man Chases a Girl"" dance performance in Fox's ""There's No Business Like Show Business"". His equivalent solo dance in Fox's ""Call Me Madam"" was, like Gene's previous dances in ""Cover Girl"" and ""On the Town"", born out of romantic frustration, but seemed like a dance of enthusiasm, because he got drunk from his frustration! Even MGM's Fred Astaire got in on this trend with his classic new love -inspired ceiling and wall ""You're All the World to Me"" dance in ""Royal Wedding"", the previous year, and his solo ""Seeing is Believing"" levitation dance on a high building in ""The Belle of New York"", released the same year as ""Singing in the Rain"", and unfortunately overshadowed by it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

There are reasons that these songs are loved even after 70 years.Tap dancing performance is upbeat and cheerful just like the romance between Don and Kathy. Trio really nails the 'Good Morning' Performance. Audience can also watch variety of dances including tango, ballroom dance, and ballet. Set Design! I almost forgot to mention. Broadway setting and studio where Don confesses his feeling to Kathy are not outdated or tacky at all after 70 years. Lightings are subdued, and a new element is added as Don steps along such as fan, ladder, smoke, and pin light. Costume is beautiful and graceful. I especially love the long white silk tail in the ballet performance.

Singin' in the Rain review,"I'll say it. I do not like musicals. Ever since i was little i always found them hard to sit through and watch.

But that doesn't mean i didn't think it was a good movie (if that makes any sense.) Like while i was watching i didn't like it but i could still see why people like it.

Stunning,"What struck me the most about the movie was both the music and the costumes. ""Singin' in the Rain"" tells the story of Don, Kathy and their friend Cosmo during the time that Hollywood pictures were beginning to talk, and therefore beginning to sing. I am a lover of musicals, yet I had never seen this one before. I was amazed by the colors of the costumes as well as the musical numbers and the choreography that went with them. Gene Kelly amazed me at his dancing abilities, as I had never seen any man dance like that before and Debbie Reynolds, who I learned was not a dancer, but in fact a gymnast and learned all her dancing on the set. In a age where the only place one can seem to see a musical is on a Broadway, or off Broadway, production, it was refreshing to see a musical as a movie with amazing sound and color.",,Anonymous,Romance
one can hardly resist its old-fashioned flair and crowd-pleasing charm,"No wonder it has been universally acclaimed as the apotheosis of Hollywood musical in the golden era, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN conjures up an enticing historical premise of the significant sea change in the film industry, with THE JAZZ SINGER (1927), the dawn of talkie which would forever change this scope of the burgeoning media.Set in 1927, Don Lockwood (Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Hagen) are Monument Pictures' golden couple on screen in the silent films, yet in private Don despises the ditsy and talentless Lina, whose diva temperament and funny sheep voice is the studio's best kept secret. Don, on the contrary, starts his career in showbiz as a vaudeville artist and stuntman with his fellow Cosmo Brown (O'Connor), so his bent of singing and dancing well-tested. One day, running away from crazed fans, Daon hops on the car of a young girl Kathy Selden (Reynolds), who quite pertly disses the superficiality of his acting and stardom, it strikes a chord to Don, who begins to question his own capability.However, it turns out Kathy is a struggling starlet, with a doll-like cuteness and a voice can sing. Don falls for her instantly, but does she love him back? Of course she does, it is a musical comedy, no one can resist a superstar's charm. After THE JAZZ SINGER becomes a sensational hit, all the studios begin to tread its footsteps, so Don-and-Lina's next picture will be their first talkie, named THE DUELLING CAVALIER, talking is a cinch for Don, but the soft underbelly is Lina's cockamamie voice, a disastrous test screening forebodes this talkie would be the Waterloo for Don-and-Lina trademark. Six weeks before its official release, Don and Cosmo creatively advice to change the picture into a singing-and-dancing musical, renamed THE DANCING CAVALIER and asks Kathy to dub Lina, the last-minute plan saves the day, except for Lina's prestigious career as an actress.Stretching from the titular song, the script cunningly grafts a cheery romance upon the nostalgia to a bygone silent era, from the opening flashbacks trace back Don and Cosmo's slapstick entertainment (also brilliantly contrasts Don and Lina's lovey-dovey public images and their personal incompatibility), until the long and elaborate set piece named Broadway MELODY BALLET, freshly revamps several music numbers from THE Broadway MELODY (1929) and Broadway MELODY OF 1936 (1935) as a fetching homage, which is not germane to the main narrative, but introduces dancer-turns-actress Cyd Charisse's vampiric moll to the limelight.Kelly, the co-director and the leading star of the project, is swooningly deft in the iconic solo titular piece, and admirably, he also magnanimously leaves the stage for his co-stars to shine, O'Connor's MAKE 'EM LAUGH is la crème de la crème, his effortless agility makes the dangerous antics look ever so easy and winsome. Although billed as the female lead, Reynolds is less a spectacle especially lined up with Hagen, who is the only one in the cast nominated for an Oscar (the film's unjust snub by the Academy is another big scandal mars the award's credibility), fakes her comical tone and upstages everyone else with sheer deadpan amusement.SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is a tested classic, a first-rate choreographic marvel, a less refined character development nevertheless, one can hardly resist its old-fashioned flair and crowd- pleasing charm.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
finest musical of all time,"What if you wanted a phrase to sum up elation in spite of difficulties? Then you illustrated it with songs, dance, a love story crossing different eras, you offered parallels in the business and personal world, and then underlined it all with a dig at a society that takes itself too seriously? Would it come become widely acknowledged as the finest musical of all time? Singin' in the Rain takes a lost art form, travelling back to the days of silent pictures. A matinée idol (played by Gene Kelly) is caught up in the transition, together with his buddy (Donald O'Connor), a co-star with a grating voice (Jean Hagen) and the girl of his dreams (Debbie Reynolds). Just as is often the case in real life, the lovers bond by accepting each other's worst side. She can't stand his pompousness but her image is shattered when she takes a lowly job and jumps out of a birthday cake. She seems the perfect 'star' but, apart from her whole opposition to the Hollywood industry, she has the jealousy of the real 'stars' to contend with.Singin' in the Rain successfully re-creates the roaring twenties. By placing much of the story within the film studios themselves, there is easy access to backdrops of wildest imagination, providing constant visual contrasts - music-hall, western, action stunts, as well as forays into black-and-white. The aural contrasts are no less scintillating. The opening scene has Kelly, Reynolds and O'Connor dancing to a jazzed-up title song, quickly cutting to the dreamy Lucky Star number for the opening credits, followed by the clamour and excitement of a red carpet interview. Parodies on silent film, dubbing for sound, and dialect coaches continue to grab attention from one moment to another.This effervescent, all-American movie (together with An American in Paris) heralded a revolution in the American musical. Part of a counter-trend against popular film noir of the day (like Double Indemnity and The Big Sleep), Singin' in the Rain has been described as a 'great amalgam of realized style and stylized realism'. Even the ending, for all its emotional fulfilment, exalts successful caricature over 'serious' film making.Although it had to overcome many difficulties in the making, it remains one of the most enduring, effervescent and exuberant of films. It spoofs not only the silent era but also many earlier movies from which most of its songs are taken. Finding true sincerity beneath such light-hearted irreverence is part of the task of the seemingly ill-matched lovers. Today, Singin' in the Rain may be bypassed by devotees of contemporary cinema, echoing O'Connor and Reynolds' characters quip: ""Why bother . . . You've seen one, you've seen them all."" Yet each year the film gains new converts.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hollywood Melody,"A man and a woman stand at the top of a stoop in the pouring rain. After they kiss and embrace, the man walks down the stairs and waves off his driver. The stage is now set for one of the most legendary sequences in cinema history.MGM's Singin' in the Rain (1952) has dazzled audiences for over 50 years. It's a movie about singing, dancing, and movie making. Gene Kelly (An American in Paris) stars as Don Lockwood, a silent film star who along with everyone else in the movie making industry is trying to make the transition from silent's to talkies in the 1920's. He is part of the duo Lockwood & Lamont, the other half being Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen). The unseen member of the threesome is Don's right-hand man and best friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O' Connor, Francis).One night after a successful premier of the latest Lockwood & Lamont feature, Don finds himself in trouble with hardcore fans and jumps into a passing car. The driver, Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds, The Unsinkable Molly Brown), is startled to find out that it is Don Lockwood, and continues to hurl a barrage of insults to his profession, ""If you've seen one, you've seen the all,"". Later that night at the after party, Don finds Kathy is one of the dancers who ends up getting herself into quite a mess with Lina.When the movie The Jazz Singer, the first full length talkie, debuts it's a smash hit. All the studios must make the change to compete. This brings production to a halt and the need for a new screenplay. Their current work in progress The Dueling Cavalier is a travesty and needs to be revamped. The only problem is Lina can't sing, dance, or act ""the triple threat"". Now they must find a way to make a winning picture.Directed by Kelly and Stanley Donen, Singin' in the Rain only received two Oscar nominations for Best Supporting Actress (Jean Hagen) and Best Score. This movie was ranked 10th all time on AFI's 100 Greatest Movie list. How could it only receive two nominations and no wins? Most likely it was due An American in Paris, released one year prior to Singin' in the Rain by MGM, winning a total of six Oscars and eight nominations.Today's cinema has changed dramatically since Singin' in the Rain. Movies have incredible special effects, the cost has gone up considerably, and the values have changed. Kelly worked like a dog to make this movie all it could be and he did that and more. The movie is filled with color and sound using a well crafted style.One of the most intense sequences in the film is the ""Make em' Laugh"" number performed by the incomparable O'Connor. He showcases his dancing abilities and acrobatic stunts. The scene involves Cosmo trying to cheer up Don. The only way he knows how is to make him laugh. The scene was so tiring that after filming O'Connor was in bed for three days straight. Reynolds also endured a lot on set trying to keep up with Kelly and O'Connor.To truly become a masterpiece a film has to have survived through many years and Singin' in the Rain has done just that. It's truly a work of art that will be cherished for years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great musical!,"It has some great numbers, including the incomparable Cyd Charisse.But what really puts this on my 'must see' list is the deep self-reference. Superficially, it is a movie about a movie, but actually the folding is a whole lot more complex, even psychedelic. The narrative structure is flashbacks, flashforwards, about the movie, IS the movie, about the fooling behind the movie (oddly, Debbie's non-movie songs were dubbed by someone else!). It has nested abstractions, and encompassing ones. It has several manner of annotative features. And the internal movie itself grows while we watch to have internal nesting of different types: the original costume drama becomes a vision from a modern newcomer whacked on the head. And further, there is the Charisse number which is another abstraction.There were precessors: 'Kane' (41) introduced the use of many parallel narrative devices, 'Children of Paradise' (45) had conflated reality and performance: 'Red Shoes' (48) took it to dance, and those are must see as well. But here, the technique becomes visual jazz improvisations on reality. Thrilling.None of the people involved ever came close on other projects. Odd.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Singin in the Rain,"Singin in the Rain is a good musical that is dynamic and is one of the first color movies if I recall. It was fast paced for me and I felt that the dances seemed to be moderate early on and then later on just got wildly out of hand. I feel like my opinion on this has to do with me not being a musical person but it didn't do anything to help pull me in and give it much of a chance.

A story about the making of musicals in the 1920's,"This movie serves as a kind of meta commentary...as it is a musical about the making of a musical. The film seems to poke fun at the desperation of the movie industry in the 20's to put out sound films, just to please audiences. The soundtrack for this movie is fantastic. I can honestly say I've never heard the entire title track ""Singing in the Rain"" until watching the whole film and it was stuck in my head for weeks. All of the musical scenes were well choreographed, looked great in color, and were extremely well voiced by the actors and actresses. The cast was largely multi talented and created a great musical in the process of making fun of a bad one.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great characters and great songs.,"A wholesome and heartwarming movie. I thought parts were genuinely funny. The acting is great too. Maybe the only thing that put me off was the amount of dancing involved. I get it that it's a musical and dancing is a key item in the plot, but somehow those long dance sequences were just too monotonous for me. Other than that a great movie overall.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Disappointing Movie,"When Isaw this film I expected something special, what I got was high camp comedy, Gene Kelly was a great actor, appearing in films Like Xanadu and many other classics, in this film he was stupid, it turned me right off, this film truly sucks, if it was his first film he would be a washed up actor. Sorry Gene, not your best film, no wonder he reverted to a Tv series Going My Way, not a bad show at all, no singing. The show also starred Leo G. Carroll and a very young Dick York (Darin In Bewitched). Nothing else to say really, That is why it scored a 3, it was for the costumes and sets. Not the acting.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A wonderful film, but only in its true version","I have always adored this movie. It is a wonderful, funny, creative and influential film. However, if you've only seen the fullscreen version, please realize that you are cheating yourself! The original widescreen version gives you the full effect and wonderful visual scope of the film. The fullscreen version is literally painful to watch. The choices made in shots take away from a cinematic masterpiece. Please, please, please invest the time in seeing this film in its original format. Also, take a few minutes and examine the ""Broadway Rhythm"" section of the film. It is a beautiful piece of dance, and is often underrated in my opinion. I have seen An American in Paris many times and of course I adore the ballet encapsulated within the film. However, the Broadway Rhythm section of Singin' in the Rain is my favorite dance within a film scene of all time. It is extremely funny if you take the time to watch it closely and it is also beautifully scored.",,Anonymous,Romance
The ultimate feel good musical,"I'm not a musical fan at all. But you can not NOT love Singin' In The Rain. Everyone knows the most famous scene where Gene Kelly sings and dances in the rain. But this film is much more than just that scene. The craftsmanship of Kelly and male co-star Donald O'Conner still looks mesmerizing. It's amazing what these guys can do with their feet. Next to that, the film (like The Artist) tells the story of a major change in Hollywood: the arrival of the talkies. It is a great behind the scenes look at the golden age of Hollywood and in my opinion this film still is (one of) the best musical out there.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
cuter than cute,"I'll be quick. This is the kind of innocent, cute musical that only musical haters can hate but everyone else loves.Cheery songs, cheery faces and cheery dancing light up the screen. Don Lockwood (or Gene Kelly) is of course the star of the show but every time I see the ""Make em' Laugh"" routine with Donald O'Connor, I can't help chuckling.I definitely think Donald is underrated in this film, the central point being focused on Debbie Reynolds and Gene.I also think Jean Hagen does a fantastic job impersonating Lina Lamont, especially during the speech lessons.In conclusion, a great movie for a rainy day with a twist at the end.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Definitely a Great Movie,"This is a great classical musical movie. The singing and dancing is just incredible. The dance numbers are intense and beautifully done that I just have to give a huge applause to the whole cast. A lot of musicals end up being really corny and in a way this one was corny but in a good way. It was executed extremely well that everything just flowed in a way that pulled the viewer in and made them want to see what happened next. Another thing that really helped make the movie was the chemistry between all of the characters. It was very believable how feelings were betrayed between each of the characters and how it changed through out the movie. The movie also did a great job in representing the shift from silent films and ""talkies"" and how some actors/ actresses had a hard time shifting. Over all definitely one of the best musicals ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Memorable film,"Memorable film. Here are several memorable performances in this film. O'Connor performs the comical ""Make 'em Laugh"", Kelly of course performs the title tune and appears in the ""Broadway Melody"" production number with a cast of thousands and the lovely Cyd Charisse with whom he has a couple of dance numbers. The stars do a delightful ""Good Mornin"" song and dance as well. Jean Hagen almost steals the film as the deceitful Lina Lamont.MGM dusted off several of their old songs for this film. ""Good Mornin'"" for example, was sung by Judy Garland in 1939's ""Babes in Arms"". The song, ""Beautiful Girl"" is ably performed by Jimmy Thompson who received no billing or acclaim for his effort. Wwatch for Rita Moreno as Zelda, Lamont's scheming ally. ""B"" western bad guy Douglas Fowley turns in a dandy performance as the frustrated director and Kathleen Freeman and King Donovan turn up in minor roles as well.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fifties Musical that has it all,"The Hollywood musical certainly went out with a bang in the early 1950s with ""The Band Wagon"" and this film: ""Singin' in the Rain"" has something for almost everyone, even those who don't care for musicals. Set in 1927, the year ""The Jazz Singer"" (and the Oscars) changed the movies forever, it is simultaneously an original musical, a period re-creation, and a good-humored satire of everything Early Hollywood-- from the stars' street clothes and PR-driven romances to styles of direction and the alleged differences between the Follies and the burlesque house (both of which supplied Silent-era sets and other rooms besides).The screenwriters pack the script with references to, and outright impersonations of, period figures: Fairbanks, Gilbert, De Mille, Chaplin and Keaton (O'Connor does them both at once, while wearing a hat that is half of each), Harold Lloyd, Clara Bow, Bebe Daniels, Norma Shearer, Louise Brooks, Pola Negri, Elinor Glyn, Busby Berkeley, and many more. Kelly and O'Connor are amazingly versatile, but the best performance comes from Jean Hagen as the haughty star from Brooklyn whose career is being ruined by the new gadget, the microphone. And Cyd Charisse does some memorable dancing as a flapper with a Lulu haircut.As if a quality script, music, dancing, singing, choreography, photography, costumes, sets, design, and period details weren't enough, SITR also manages to squeeze in several original and ingenious movies-within-the-movie (bits of a silent swashbuckler, a transitional clunker, and a hilarious ""demonstration Talkie""), and some Charleston and Black Bottom.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
All the best,"Many have said that the two numbers in ""Singin' in the Rain"" that feature Charisse probably belong in another movie. I don't know as the flapper in jade, she sexes up Kelly's rube character to a steamy height unusual in movies of that era. In a dance full of wonderful moves, my favorite comes after she's left him with her cigarette holder. She sashays away from him, blowing on her nails in studied boredom. She's gotten some distance away, and as she tosses her right hand back, he throws down the cigarette holder, grabs her hand and brings her flying up to his chest, where she proceeds to slide down Kelly's thigh to the floor for one of several prone positions she takes during this duet, from which she returns to a standing position with amazing grace. I'm not wild about dances that rely heavily on props, but this one does so very effectively: they're amusing and they reinforce character.And thank heaven for the artistic control that allowed Kelly to keep the ""crazy veil"" number in the picture. Charisse has discussed that dance, where she got to show off her early ballet training, most charmingly for a ""Word of Mouth"" feature on TCM. She and others have noted over the years that the wind machines required to keep that impossibly long veil moving and undulating between and above her and Kelly made filming a nightmare. But it looks effortless, on a set that is a subtle optical illusion—not as deep nor as sloped as it appears to be.Both dances end the same way. Whether she's a cheap gangster's moll in garish green or a Grecian goddess in white, less obviously in a mobster's sway, Charisse is invariably lured back to reality by proffered baubles and menacingly tossed coins. But at the end of the crazy veil number, she's the one tossing the coins.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Be Warned: This is a musical!,"I can't say this is one of my favorite movies. I'm not a huge fan of musicals so I did not have very high aspirations for this film. I thought that the plot would be a little more exciting so that caused me to loose focus and therefore ultimately not like the film. The only saving grace for this film was that the characters were moderately funny which made it relatively enjoyable and kept my interest until then end. The cinematic elements of this film were very strong but I think the most effective was the light and obviously, since this is a musical, the sound. The light really gave the film that movie studio look that the production staff was looking for. The movie sounded good overall and those who have a greater appreciation for music could certainly find a loathing for the way the sound was implemented in the film.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Perhaps the Greatest Musican Ever Made,"Singin' in the Rain (1952)**** (out of 4)If this isn't the greatest musical ever made it's certainly near the very top of the list. Set in 1927, a movie studio decides to pull the production on a silent picture and convert it to sound. The lead star (Gene Kelly) is fine with the idea but the only problem is that the leading lady (Jean Hagen) doesn't have a good speaking voice. After a disastrous preview screening, the idea gets launched that they should dub the actresses voice with that of someone who can sing and speak (Debbie Reynolds). SINGIN' IN THE RAIN just had its 60th Anniversary re-release and it was quite something getting to see it on the big screen but what's even more remarkable was the fact that the film made it this long. It's funny to know that the film was only a moderate success when it was first released and I wonder what the Kelly and company would have thought at the time if people would be gathering sixty years later to watch the film, which is certainly one of the most loved of all time. Even though everything in the film is a major success, I think it's fair to say that Kelly deserves most of the credit since he not only played the lead but he also co-directed, came up with the dances and helped with just about every part of the picture. The work Kelly does here is just remarkable and especially considering how many terrific moments there are with just the singing and dancing alone. The title track and dance is one of the most memorable, charming and joyous in film history but we also get classic takes with 'Make Em Laugh,' 'Good Morning' and the closing big number, a take on 'The Broadway Melody.' Not only are these sequences terrific but so is the main story as it works perfectly well as a throwback to the day when musicals really took off. The stuff dealing with Hollywood's transition from silent to sound rings especially true and leads to some terrific jokes and some very funny moments. Of course, it goes without saying but the entire cast is terrific with Kelly leading the way with a very strong performance in the lead. Reynolds is also very good as the virginal new star and Donald O'Connor gets some terrific moments with his laugh out loud funny performance. Hagen deserves a lot of credit for the high-pitched dumb blonde who can't do anything right. SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is clearly one masterpiece that really lives up to its high reputation. It really doesn't matter how many times you've seen it, the magic lives on each repeat viewing because the dancing, the singing, the mood and the performances are simply so good that it's impossible not to get drawn into the material.",,Anonymous,Romance

Singin' in the Rain - 5 Stars,"""Singin' in the Rain"" has provided me with probably the most joyful cinematic experience so far in my life. The movie functions entirely on happy juice. Some movie characters can light up a room; the main cast in ""Singin' in the Rain"" can light up the whole darn street. Many profound critics, like Roger Ebert and Pauline Kael, has declared it as the best Hollywood musical ever made. No wonder.Great movies have a way of beating time. Their original audience is replaced by a new generation, but the positive reception stays the same. Curiously, ""Singin' in the Rain"" earned more praise as it got older. Though a success at the box office upon its release in 1952, people were late to give the praise it really deserved. It seemed that the increasing admiration continued with the following generations. And as I saw the film for the first time only a few nights ago, I was struck and stuck in a state of awe. It's been a long, long while since Hollywood has made a musical like this one, hasn't it?""Singin' in the Rain"" is a marvelous movie for many reasons, but watching it at this point in time highlights some things about it that has become a rarity in today's movies, making these things all the more treasured. Consider, for instance, its attention to a sense of movement. The sets are simple and the props are few, but one can tell that the makers of ""Singin' in the Rain"" have spent a whole lot of time and training to the people and their performances. And these performances were about feelings and passion and about the art of performance itself. Most musicals today, and other genres too, have learned to place too much dependence on money, for the sake of money.

This film will make anyone like musicals,Singin' in the Rain sets the standard for musicals because it really owns what it is. Other musicals take themselves too seriously and make the musical number seem out of place. Others are too nonsensical and lose the audiences attention. Singin' in the Rain is perfectly balanced. The acting performances are great. Characters meant to be loved are lovable and those meant to be hated are despicable. The musical talent these actors possess is impressive as well. The choreography is wonderful and the singing is amazing. However some songs do go on too long and lose some of their splendor. This does not happen often though. There is also too little character development between the lead actor and actress making their romance a bit unbelievable. But that is forgiven because the nature of the film is meant to be jolly. This would be my number one recommendation to anyone who has never seen a musical.,8.0,Anonymous,Romance

A smile inducing musical classic,"Ranked by the American Film Institute as the 5th best film of all time in a 2007 publication, Singin' in the Rain remains to this day one of the most whimsical and purely enjoyable films ever created.While its hard to quantify or substantiate such a claim, Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly's comedic themed musical, that additionally acts as a love letter to the early years of cinema and the once prevalent screen musical, is a film that charms throughout its story of a group of Hollywood players transitioning from silent film-making to to the ""talkies"".From the moment the film begins through to the moment it ends there's barely a moment that goes by that feels as though its wasted a second of screen time with Donen and Kelly pushing themselves and their cast (many of whom admitted this was one of the most grueling films they ever worked on) to achieve greatness, with Rain's abundance of iconic scenes and song and dance showpieces deserving of their places in the trophy room of classic cinema moments.One to always push himself and demand nothing but 110% commitment to the cause, Kelly clearly required a lot from his co-stars, especially from the then 19 year old Debbie Reynolds who had to take a crash course in dancing to bring her live-wire performance as budding Hollywood star Kathy Selden to life, but his hard stance towards excellence paid of handsomely in his passion project here, with Rain a near flawless example of the joyous nature of cinema at its most playful.You could spend many an hour examining and exploring the many grand moments found throughout the film, a whole piece could be written about the incredibly realized showpiece of the titular song alone, but the film also has more than one ace up its sleeve when you include great moments such as the Good Morning sequence between the central trio of Kelly, Reynolds and the films comedic MVP Donald O'Connor or O'Connor's great staging of the Make Em Laugh song number.These are all moments where you will find yourself with a big old smile on your face, toes tapping away on their own volition as the film can't help but charm you into a transformative like state of pure cinematic ecstasy, with the film understanding it is here to please and entertain at all costs, a piece of art that exists solely to offer laughter and joy to those lucky enough to watch it.Final Say -A wonderful piece of golden era film-making, Singin' in the Rain is deserving of its reputation as the king of Hollywood musicals. A film the whole family can enjoy, Kelly and Donen's film is the perfect antidote to the moment in time we all find ourselves in.4 1/2 couches out of 5",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Said Before...(I'm Sure),"I have to admit that I am not much up on my musicals.  Nevertheless, after watching this movie it makes loads of sense why this might very well be the greatest musical of all time.  This flick was really enjoyable from start to finish! However, not being a big musical buff, a few things really stuck out to me: 1.) For all the greatness of Gene Kelly, Donald O' Conner stole the show (although I realize that Kelly is the one who choreographed all the moves). 2.) The only thing that keeps the movie from being a ""10"" in my book is the whole ""Broadway Melody.""  While it is very entertaining in itself; nevertheless, it made no sense in the grand scheme of the movie.  In other words, it seemed liked SUPERB filler...yet it is still seemed to be filler material.

Yes,"I enjoyed every aspect of this movie. From the plot to the acting to the cinematography. Everything was made perfectly, and the songs weren't ""corny"" but instead catchy! The characters all evolve a little, and the annoying protagonist gets hers in the end. This movie is perfect for any age. This movie is a musical, if you didn't gather that. Most people my age wouldn't agree, but musicals can be interesting, and this movie is great evidence. Also, a lot of editing and mechanics went into this movie. A lot of special effects were added, but it made it that much more fun to watch. Not many dull moments in this film!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Singin' in the Rain,"This movie is a colorful up beat type of musical. This film is full of classic tunes that they will have stuck in your head for the rest of the week. However some songs and dance sequences can drag on and seem a bit dramatic.Speaking of dragging out I feel that is all the ending was , a big drawn out symphony of dance and song that didn't seem to fit or really feel necessary. The title song is popularized in a more recent film a Clock Work Orange(1971), and having seen that film first i think gave me the wrong preconceived feeling about the song maybe causing me to enjoy it less in this film. However this film definitely leaves your foot tapping and has its own type of hilarity in its dance routines.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not A Bad But Not A Great One,"""As a viewer, I was excited to watch 'Singin' in the Rain' as it is considered a classic musical film, but unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations. The budget for the film was evident in the impressive sets and costumes, but the story and script fell short. The scenario was predictable and lacked depth, and the acting from the lead actors felt wooden and forced at times.Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont, played by Gene Kelly and Jean Hagen respectively, were not convincing in their roles and their chemistry was lacking. The musical numbers, while visually stunning, were not memorable and failed to capture the audience's emotions.The film's plot and characters are set in the late 1920s Hollywood, which could have been an interesting setting, but it was not utilized to its full potential. The film also lacked the humor that was expected, which made it quite monotonous.All in all, I would rate this movie a 5 out of 10. While it may be a classic in the eyes of some, it did not live up to my expectations and left me feeling underwhelmed. 'Singin' in the Rain' is not a bad film per se, but it's not a great one either. It's an average film that fails to deliver the emotion and energy that a musical should.""",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

This is the film that will change your opinions on musicals.,"Now, before watching this film I never really cared for musicals. I just thought that musicals were bland stories where the characters would just go and start singing terrible songs every five minutes. But with Singin' in The Rain there was something different about it. The songs that were sung in this film were enjoyable to listen to. Each one had a certain characteristic to it that fit each scene well. And the colors in this film all look amazing. They're so vivid that your eyes will always be focused on the scene. And I must say the one scene where they are thinking of ideas with the studio president is without a doubt the best part of the movie. It does drag on for longer then it needs to be but nonetheless it was still enjoyable to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Best musical,I will be honest I hate musicals. I think they are corny and just not relatable. That being said I was a little frustrated when I started to like this movie. I loved the beginning. The movie is funny and the singing just flows its not random. it was a good movie the middle/end was slow in my opinion. The scenes confused me and I wasn't sure if it was actually happening or if he was just imagining it. The ending of the movie was perfect though since the evil girl go exactly what she deserved. I was actually very frustrated. she had the whiny voice and I am glad the audience was able to see that. I also never made the realization that America fell in love with stars and sometimes had never even actually heard their voices.,8.0,Anonymous,Romance
More Than A Movie,"The year is 1952. Incredibly but the mesmerizing performances of the actors especially Gene Kelly's dances feel us living in a lovely dream.

The Forecast Is Only Bright and Sunny for This Unparalleled MGM Classic,"Only the cloudiest of curmudgeons could possibly begrudge a musical as pervasively buoyant and consistently inventive as this 1952 classic. Thanks to the unstoppable creative energy of Gene Kelly and co-director Stanley Donen and the sharp writing of the redoubtable team of Adolph Green and Betty Comden, what could have been just another MGM confection is really a non-stop singing and dancing entertainment and a clever satire on the talkie revolution that transformed Hollywood's movie industry in the late 1920's. Fortunately, the 50th Anniversary, two-disc set released in 2002 is an appropriate tribute to this film since it includes a pristine print, clear audio and plentiful extras.Kelly's athleticism and natural braggadocio manner are put to optimal use in the fictionalized story of silent screen stars Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont, both of whom make a particularly bumptious transition to sound with their romantic costume epic, ""The Dueling Cavalier"". Thanks to the introduction of primitive and awkwardly placed microphones, the stars' mute over-emoting looks and sounds ludicrous, in particular, Lina's Bronx-accented helium squealing. Off-screen, Don can barely stand Lina, and what's more, he becomes smitten with young ingénue Kathy Selden much to the consternation of Lina. After the movie's disastrous preview, Don's best friend and piano accompanist Cosmo Brown comes up with the idea of turning the potential fiasco into a musical, ""The Dancing Cavalier"", with Lina's unbearably comic voice dubbed by Kathy.While Lina uses blackmail to keep Kathy under wraps, the plot still comes to its inevitable conclusion but not before an elaborate and rather anachronistic production number, the fourteen-minute ""Broadway Melody Ballet"". Although not as enthralling as Kelly's similarly lengthy tribute to the French master artists in ""An American in Paris"" the year before, this number has all the razzle-dazzle one could possibly hope for in a single number, including the leggy Cyd Charisse dancing flawlessly as a coin-flipping femme fatale. In fact, the whole film is so energetic and saturated with color that it's hard not to be enraptured.Most every musical number is a memorable classic from the classroom antics of Kelly and O'Connor in ""Moses Supposes"" to the ebullient furniture prancing of ""Good Morning"" to O'Connor's acrobatic turns on ""Make 'Em Laugh"" to Kelly's classic rain-drenched solo set to the title tune. Kelly is inarguably at his peak here, and so is the youthful O'Connor who proves even more than the females, to be Kelly's most compatible dance partner. Nineteen-year old Debbie Reynolds is kewpie doll-adorable as Kathy and dances with hard-earned ease with her veteran colleagues. The scene stealer, however, is Jean Hagen who plays the not-so-dumb Lina with genuine comic élan. You will also notice twenty-year old Rita Moreno playing a Clara Bow-like movie star named Zelma Zanders.The DVD comes with a wonderfully insightful if somewhat crowded commentary track with participation from O'Connor, Reynolds, Donen, Comden, Green, Charisse, and co-star Kathleen Freeman (who plays Lina's failed elocution teacher), as well as film historian Rudy Behlmer and director Baz Luhrmann. Most of them also participate and repeat their recollections in a thirty-minute featurette on the second disc, ""What a Glorious Feeling"" made specifically for the DVD. There are two other shorts - one on the first disc called ""Reel Sounds"" which details the evolution of the sound picture during the setting of the movie, and the other is a lengthier 1996 documentary, ""Musicals Great Musicals: The Arthur Freed Unit at MGM"", which provides a broader view of the classic MGM musicals of the period.There are also trailers, some outtakes and antiquated movie excerpts of songs written by Freed and Nacio Herb Brown, who penned ""Singin' in the Rain"". All in all, this is a terrific package for a most deserving Hollywood classic well worth repeated viewings.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great movie,Musicals have never been a favorite genre of mine in fact I found them to be rather boring but this film changed my view of them for the better. The colors were bold and daring and made the movie feel modern. The musical numbers themselves were catchy and fun so they were bearable to watch. The dancing was a bit to over the top for me but it flowed well with the film and did make it more entertaining to watch. The actors did a great job and due to that this movie was enjoyable to watch. Lastly the plot was simple enough to be easily followed. Overall I really enjoyed all of the aspects of this film and it was a lot more entertaining than I had anticipated which was a pleasant surprise. I would defiantly recommend this to any one with an interest in musicals.,9.0,Anonymous,Romance

I Could've Watched Another Hour,"I had always avoided ""Singin' in the Rain"" because I thought it was one long musical number. Don't ask me why. I think it's because the only clip I'd ever seen was Gene Kelly singing in the rain.Turns out it was an excellent movie and I'm not a fan of musicals at all. There is a very short list of musicals I like and the only one I truly truly love is ""The Wizard of Oz."" I prefer dialogue over singing everytime, but ""Singin' in the Rain"" had a terrific plot with the right balance of singing and dialogue.The movie takes place in 1927 and the main character, Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly), was a big time silent film star. He and his regular co-star, Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), were media darlings and Lina believed that their on-screen romance extended to off-screen as well, while Don wasn't that interested in her.The two of them had major adjustments to make when 1.) Don found love in Kathy Seldon (Debbie Reynolds) and 2.) the studio was planning to make the transition to pictures with sound. The second matter didn't seem like such a big deal except that Lina had the most annoying voice imaginable, which made her character hilarious.I think that's it.I tend to like comical musicals and ""Singin' in the Rain"" was funny. It was funny, lively, and gay (as in merry). Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds, and Jean Hagen were sublimely entertaining and I could've watched them another hour. ""Singin' in the Rain"" doesn't supplant ""The Wizard of Oz"" as my favorite musical, but it is easily in my top five.HBO Max.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Signin in the Rain Review,"Singin' in the Rain (1952), directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, is a joyful, exuberant celebration of Hollywood's transition from silent films to talkies. Set in the late 1920s, the film follows Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly), a silent film star, as he navigates the chaos of the industry's shift to sound. Along with his co-star Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) and aspiring actress Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds), Don faces the challenge of turning a silent film into a successful musical, all while dealing with Lina's diva behavior.The film is a true classic, filled with unforgettable musical numbers, such as the iconic title song ""Singin' in the Rain,"" where Kelly's performance is both charming and infectious. The choreography is dazzling, particularly in the energetic dance routines, and the humor is sharp, blending satire of Hollywood's growing pains with lighthearted romance and slapstick comedy. Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds have fantastic chemistry, and their performances elevate the film into an enduring favorite.What makes Singin' in the Rain so enduring is its perfect blend of humor, heart, and brilliant musical numbers. It's a feel-good film that celebrates the magic of cinema, while also offering a clever commentary on the challenges and absurdities of Hollywood. The film's timeless appeal, catchy songs, and dazzling dance numbers make it a must-see for any fan of classic cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Shows passion for the art of movie making,"Appreciated the look at movie history, especially the use of sound even when the industry wasn't quite ready for it. The passion for movie making and affection for silent film can be seen in the funny film clips within the film. The transition from silent to talking film was tough. It's sad, real, and funny when the director (film within the film) tries to get the performer to talk into the microphone. Best scene was seeing and hearing the film from the director's point of view; he struggled with new technology and we all can relate to that. Perhaps an editing weakness is that some dancing shots are too long and a few too short. Finally, with awe, wow, that's dancing at its very best, and they make it look fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Classic film, yet flawed","It's almost sacrilegious to find fault with a classic film, one on most top 10 lists of great all-time films, but I continue to wonder about the dream sequence. Enough has been said about all of great scenes and song and dance numbers, but what about the Gene Kelly / Cyd Charisse scene? I never liked the piece and thought it totally stopped the pace of the film. The scene itself seems to have nothing to do with the picture and just drags on and on. I left the movie for many years and in watching it again my opinion of that scene only gets worse. I turned on many people to the film over the years, including my family. The first thing they said when the movie was over was, ""what was with that dream scene? Is just dragged on and on!"" I can only guess the director, Stanley Donnen either thought that somehow presented another view of the toughness of making it in Hollywood, or Gene Kelly used his star power to make sure that number stayed in the film as an ego trip. I would have much rather seen the deleted number with Debbie Reynolds singing to the billboard. Oh well, it's still a great movie. Though it meant something different to audiences who saw this picture only 20-30 years after the advent of talking pictures and who heard these songs in other movies, it still is good family entertainment.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the few absolutely perfect films ever made!,"Singin' in the Rain is absolutely one of the very few perfect films ever made in the history of the medium. The rapid pacing of the editing, the snappy dialouge, the purely genuine performances, the glorious cinematogaphy, the framing of the scenes, the songs, the themes, etc. etc. all contribute greatly to this film being not only a supremely entertaining picture but also a lasting work of art.  I readily admit that I am not a lover of musicals, but this simply works as a celebration of life. Hidden amid the technicolor hues and radiance are a wide assortment of life affirming truths: love the art in yourself, not yourself in the art (Stanislavski), remain loyal and work hard. This is just to list a precious few lessons to be learned. This is also one of the few films that everyone, no matter what age or religious orientation can enjoy, despite a large number of suggestive puns and jokes. Gene Kelley, Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds and Jean Hagen as well as the entire cast display what class, beauty and committment are all about in relation to the craft of acting.

"Funny, Colorful, Entertaining!","Probably the greatest musical ever made (and also one of the greatest comedies), Singin' in the Rain is the definitive form of entertainment. Starring screen legends Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, and Donald O'Connor, Singin' in the Rain was released in 1952 as an all musical, all singing, all dancing extravaganza.  It truly is.  It is probably the greatest feel-good movie of all time.  Kelly and O'Connor have a great musical duo with ""Moses Supposes.""  Add Reynolds and you have the classic ""Good Morning."" O'Connor's ""Make 'em Laugh"" is a scream and hilarious.  Kelly has his unforgettable ""Singin' in the Rain"" number where he literally tap-dances with an umbrella under pouring rain.  Jean Hagen, as Lina Lamont, was the only actor to be nominated for an Oscar and is truly the standout in the film providing most of the laughs as a brainless and obnoxious blonde with an annoying high-pitched voice.  The film is a perfect showcase for showing the transition from silent films to talkies and all the mishaps that came along with the period of the late 20s and early 30s.  Witness the romance, the dancing, the music, the singing, the comedy, the profound impact of the greatest musical entertainment of all time!  10/10",,Anonymous,Romance
Not only a great musical. A great comedy too !,I'm not a fan of musicals but I always wanted to see that movie.

The Greatest Musical Ever,"Or is it? I don't know. I first got interested in musicals when I saw Hepburn and Astaire in Funny Face (1957). My logical reaction was to watch Singin' in the Rain (1952). The story is extremely smart and funny - two great silent stars having trouble to pass through to talkies, Lina Lamont is the great, special treat. My problem with it is that years went by and I continued to study musicals.It seems to me that all numbers are recycled versions of other movies. The titled song first came up in Broadway Melody of 1929, and was quite popular in the 30's and 40's. And what can be said of Good Mornin'? I'm sorry! I know that for most people that song finishes up with Kelly, O'Connor and Reynolds laughing out loud in a couch, but for me it's Rooney and Garland selling a song in Babes in Arms (1939). I've Got a Feeling You're Fooling only reminds me now of Robert Taylor, and Would You brings back the Jeanette MacDonald in San Francisco. As for Make Them Laugh, Freed himself was ashamed of that - I mean, could he more obviously have copied Cole Porter's classic Be A Clown?In the end, Singin' in the Rain might be considered the greatest musical ever because of its extremely original story, but definitely not because of its musical numbers. I think that, at MGM in the 50's, that title might as well belong to The Band Wagon (1954), Minnelli's underrated masterpiece starring the greatest dancer of all time (Astaire - it's not an argument, Kelly will always be second best and everyone knows it) and Cyd Charisse (a much more interesting leading lady than Reynolds, who I always found annoying).",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Greatest Movie Musical of All Time,"The greatest movie musical of all time!  ""Singin' in the Rain"" is justly famous for Gene's immortal dance in the rain but there's so much more to love.

Donald O'Connor proves himself worthy to dance with Gene in ""Moses"" and ""Fit as a Fiddle"" and brings down the house with ""Make 'Em Laugh.""  It's hard not to applaud in your own home after that number.If you see a few Gene Kelly movies (and I advise that you do) you may notice that he always wears his hats tilted to the side in an inimitable way that will always be cool.  No one wears a hat like Gene Kelly.There is no other movie that I can pop in the VCR that will fill me with the joy that ""Singin' in the Rain"" does.  This is a movie that can be watched over and over again and never lose its magic.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Gotta Dance!""","This is a movie that'll give you Happy Feet just thinking about it once you've seen it.  Quite possibly the purest movie musical ever made, `Singin' In the Rain,' directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, has everything you could want in a musical:  A good story, perfect cast, imaginative choreography, memorable music and songs, terrific performances, and a presentation that is nothing less than inspired.  It takes you behind the scenes of the movie business, set during the transitional period between the heyday of silent films and the advent of talkies.  Don Lockwood (Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are two of the biggest stars in Hollywood, the Tracy and Hepburn of Monumental Studios, which is about to release their latest movie-- a swashbuckling costume drama.  But a rival studio has just released `The Jazz Singer,' and overnight the industry is revolutionized, and silent films are just that quickly a thing of the past.  To keep up and stay afloat, the major studios need to produce pictures that talk.  And where does Monumental start?  By retooling their latest big star vehicle (with Lockwood and Lamont) into a MUSICAL swashbuckling costume drama.  If it's song and dance the public wants, then that's what they'll get-- right along with the drama of the costume and the swashbuckling thrown in to boot. There's one problem, though; the sound of Lina's voice has the effect of fingernails scraping a chalkboard, and her diction isn't going to land her the role of Juliet anytime soon.  The powers that be at Monumental fear they may soon have a `falling' star on their hands.  But there's always a solution, of course; and leave it to Don's partner, Cosmo (Donald O'Connor), to come up with it.  And it just happens to involve a young lady named Kathy (Debbie Reynolds), with whom Don has just recently become acquainted.  And that's where the story really begins.Kelly and Donen (who also teamed up for `On the Town' and `It's Always Fair Weather') certainly know how to put on a show.  The name of their game is Entertainment-- yes, with a capital `E'-- and that's exactly what you get. The dazzling production numbers are upbeat and electrifying:  Donald O'Connor's `Make 'Em Laugh;' `Good Mornin',' which features Debbie Reynolds (joined by Kelly and O'Connor); a diction lesson by Kelly and O'Connor that begins with `Moses,' who `Supposes his 'toeses' are roses;' and a transporting routine with Kelly and Cyd Charisse.  But the highlight is Kelly doing the title song while `Singin' and dancin' in the rain.'  And these are but a few of the magical marvels of this film.When Kelly sings `Gotta dance!' you'd better believe it, because he's the best of the best, and he's at the top of his game here.  He's a consummate entertainer and a perfectionist, and simply a joy to watch.  And with O'Connor next to him you really have something special, as they tend to bring out the best in one another (I submit their `Moses' number as evidence).  Also, they seem to genuinely enjoy working together; there appears to be an almost fun sense of spirited competition going on as they dance, and it's an invigorating experience (if this wasn't so, then they've pulled off a marvelous bit of acting).  But no one can out-dance Gene Kelly. Period.  And he may not be the world's greatest singer, but in this film his voice is in top form, as well.Also a consummate performer, Donald O'Connor more than holds his own with Kelly on the dance floor (and he's at the top of a very short list of those who can), and the sense of humor and personality he brings to the film are invaluable.  His energetic `Make 'Em Laugh' number does just that; and while it's funny, it also showcases O'Connor's versatility and gives him a chance to display some amazing moves (how many people-- even professional dancers-- can dance up the side of a wall and into a back flip?).  And he makes it look so easy.  As Cosmo, he's the quintessential second banana and jack-of-all-trades.  He dances, sings, plays piano, cracks jokes, pops up for tech work in the sound booth, and on top of everything else he's an idea man and a general facilitator of anything and everything that needs facilitating.  If Danny Kaye had a brother it would be O'Connor; and-- like Kelly-- he's just a pleasure to watch.Debbie Reynolds was twenty-years-old when she made this film, and she's a perfect fit with Kelly and O'Connor.  Beautiful and talented-- and mature beyond her years-- she has a kind of sparkle all her own and a terrific screen presence.  She can sing and she can dance, she looks good no matter what she's doing, and there's a wholesome, girl-next-door quality about her that makes her endearing.  It also makes Kathy a very real and believable character, and Reynolds plays her perfectly.As Lina Lamont, the girl with a voice that could make cats cry, Jean Hagen is an absolute riot.  Reminiscent of a character Mia Farrow would create years later in `Radio Days,' Sally White-- though perhaps a bit more dense-- Lina takes the `vain' out of `vanity,' and Hagen brings her to life with a vivid, memorable performance.  And it's just another of the many elements that make this such a great film.The supporting cast includes Millard Mitchell (Simpson), Rita Moreno (Zelda), Douglas Fowley (Roscoe) and Kathleen Freeman (Phoebe).  If pure entertainment is what you're after, you need look no further than `Singin' In the Rain,' which successfully dispels any doubts that there is, indeed, magic in the movies.  Because this movie is magic, a sheer delight from beginning to end no matter how many times you see it.  There's been a number of great musicals made over the years, but of them all, with Kelly and O'Connor at the top of their form, this one just may be the definitive offering.  I rate this one 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Also, the leads are fantastic- although Gene Kelly as the hero was pure exuberance personified I really admired more Donald 'O Connor, whose legs seems to be motorized and who was the definition of the word ""rascal"".  And who knew that Debbie Reynolds was so cute back in the day?  All in all, a movie highly recommended if you love to watch movies just for the sheer joy they can have.",,Anonymous,Romance
They don't make them like they used to,"This is such a wonderful film. An original, clever story filled with amazing musical performances.

The greatest musical ever made,"Singin in the Rain is not only the greatest musical ever made, its one of the greatest movies ever made.  Gene Kelly, Donald O' Connor, and Debbie Reynolds are SO talented.  Especially Kelly.  His dancing is just so amazing to watch.  And all three have such beautiful voices, and ""Good Morning"" was such a wonderful song because all three of their songs blended so beautifully.  Singin in the Rain is one of my favorite movies, and it has one of my favorite soundtracks",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"If Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder, this is Beauty at its Best","Imagine you are strapped to a torture chair Mr. A pops up on a television screen and announces nonchalantly: ""Dear XYZ. This may be the last day you get to see your parents. You will have the movie 'Singing in the Rain' playing in front of you. At the end of the film, you choose your favorite number and scribble in down on a piece of paper."" If I were the victim, I would prefer dying. Anyone who has seen SITR will really face this dilemma. We have numbers ranging from the titular 'Gotta Dance' to the benign 'Good Morning', titillating 'Singing in the Rain', dazzling 'Beautiful Girls', hilarious 'Make Em Laugh', foot-thumping and naughty 'Fit as a Fiddle (And Ready for Love)', chirpy 'All I do is dream of you' and the poignant 'You were meant for me'. Selecting one would be to disregard the other numbers in this legendary, avant-garde spectacular, extravagant, joyous, spellbinding and sizzling, magnum opus par excellence! Singin in the Rain is a lustrous effort showcasing the making of a movie in changing times. Lamont (Hagen) and Lockwood (Gene) are silent-film's darling couple, revered and envied by fans and carnal, shameless paparazzi who write 'bananas' about the couple. The cameras flash as celebrities grace the red carpet, the first being a unhappy sexagenarian-or-so with a unusually happy and ditsy girl in her 20's (gold-digger alert), the second an impassive one that is supposedly gleeful and then enter the couple-of-the-moment, with Cosmo being ignored completely, smiling photogenically, slickly pushing away an intruding paparazzi. Lockwood then glibly fabricates a make-believe story, devoid of crushing reality, while contradictory events play on screen. The reality of the couple too is quite different. Lamont is an egocentric, deluded, diva with a screechy voice and uncultured manners, reviled by much of the crew, who now face the brunt when both have to star in a talkie. To Lockwood's side are his comical yet versatile partner Cosmo and his love Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds), chirpy, sprightly lass. And the director, producer etc. while Lamont has her by-the-book lawyers. What follows are unforgettable, timeless musical numbers with effervescent colors, embracing both screen and stage.What makes this movie such a bundle of crackling joy is its interminable will to entertain. It has a buoyant story to be, which is rare for musicals that normally falter in this facet; iconic, veteran performances, delectable dance routines (some are as sizzling as a sizzler heated to perfection), memorable music and taut direction. With every viewing, the viewer not only is enchanted by its timeless persistence but also taken aback by the depth of the film. British countdown voting 'Grease' as the best musical ever is a travesty. Grease was greasy, a movie that has a pungent '70-80s' odor with clumsy, non sequitor storyline. SITR however is a movie that transcends all times, and this is how musicals should be made- without compromises.The musical aspect itself would've covered a 1000 word if I had the choice. This, clubbed with creamy, crème de la crème dance routines by Kelly, Donald, Debbie and extras transports the audience to a heavenly stadium. And everything is so faultlessly placed, each balancing the other. The first, Fit as a Fiddle, is more for the feet, 'All I do "" too flutters up the atmosphere. 'Make Em Laugh' is a comical treat, and really explores Donald's comical forte (The funny faces he makes are drop-to-the-floor funny!). Then we move on to 'Beautiful Girls"", a classy number, that is preceded by a dazzling montage on the burgeoning of musicals in the 20s; 'You Were' is radiant, powerful, slender, 'Moses' again increases the pace (redundant though some may find it, it still seems refreshing, to keep the attention of the fidgety audience intact). 'GM' with its impromptu Hawaii interlude is quite a spectacle, while 'SITR' is legendary. Then, to top it all, we have 'Broadway Melody' a twelve minute clou du spectacle, with an enchanting, ethereal number by Charisse and Kelly. In fact, Kelly's lines are so expertly and gracefully executed I had a vicarious ecstasy within me. I would be delighted to see more movies of his.The acting is stupendous across the board. And the Oscars and the Critics Circles should be ashamed for not recognizing the merit of this wonder. I'll enlist the performances in brief: 1) Gene: Marvelous, with shining comic-timing, he is the ultimate ladies' man and quite a gentleman too. Watch out for his chemistry with Debbie and his mis-chemistry with Jean. Favorite lines: ""Believe me; I don't like her half as much as I hate you. You REPTILE!"" ""What can I do to you, I'm just a shadow!"" are ROFTL ones.2) Debbie: Naïve, bubbly and a girl-next door Kathy is so gently played by Debbie, shedding any grandiosity of an actress and adding a genteel quality to the film.3) Donald: Robbed! Yeah, carrying a performance with such jovialness is hard, and incorporating silly faces without making the movie look silly is indeed Oscar-worthy.4) Jean Hagen: Probably the most distinctive aspect of the film apart from the dance-numbers is the hare-brained Lena Lamont, hysterically played by Hagen. Her delivery is impeccable, with perhaps the most memorable lines. (Including the scene with her speech therapist) 5) The rest fill up the minute crevices in the film. The surly director, Lamont's speech therapist (perhaps an aspiring but failed actress herself in the film) etc. solidify the movie.The most alluring aspect is its replay value, as I've seen it four times in 3 days, not just being enticed by the flashing lights but being educated on the fiascos the poor actors of the 20s had to endure. Singing in the Rain is everything; the granddaddy of musicals. I'll take one step further and say it's one of the best movies in film history. Its efforts have paid indeed. And its infinitely better than that overrated Casablanca.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Singin' in the Rain,"It took fifty years but this movie finally found an audience, not too surprising given today's trends. Me, I couldn't enjoy a musical making mockery its mainstay, even as it has moments that feel like reviving oases in a desert of dry wits: one gorgeous melody (raindance), an incredible routine (Make 'em Laugh, perhaps tribute to early phyiscal humor) & Reynold's bouncy Good Morning, yet, Singin has the worst off key opener in film and proves little more than smart aleck's delight, using the Silent era for cheap laughs, often on the augmented Brooklyn accent of talented Jean Hagen (Asphalt) & Millard Mitchell who should've stayed on the range (W73). ""Buttercup mood?"" Bosh!The big numbers had better be perfect with Gene spending months to get each raindrop falling right and Don likely devoting as much time climbing the walls. But the best musicals go beyond their routines, subtracting silly scenes and pseudo sex in addition of serious sentiment. I don't like the arithmetic of co-directors Kelly & Donen for a movie that, in 1952, the heyday of musicals, barely blipped on film fan's radars but has, in the new millennium, oddly become the best thing since buttered popcorn.The pen & sword will always vie for dominence but it's the status quo that has them both beat. There are so many joyous movie musicals (Oliver!, Gigi, Swing Time, Sound of Music, Elvis, West Side) that the AFI believing anyone or anything could determine the best of all time (Singin) only proves the committee has many more films to see, if they can put down their phones long enough to seriously engage (2/4).",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
the song alone makes the movie,"I'm still a very young man (14 yearsold)  but my aspiration in life is to be a film critic. So I started watching the old classic movies.  The first one I  said I needed to watch was Singin In The Rain.  After seeing it many times since I have come to one conclusion.  Gene Kelly singing in the rain is the single handed most beautiful and aspiring pieces of work ever caught on film.  I think that the rest of the movie is also just pure classic. Moses and Make Em Laugh are two classic scenes that any person who has ever seen a film should see this movie.  Donald O'Conner is great and Gene Kelly is just so perfect.  May he rest in peace.  In conclusion, Singin In The Rain is just beautiful and no one but Gene Kelly could pull that off.  The only thing that comes even close to me is the end of the first back to the future and of course the end of Casablanca.  But Singin In The Rain is just the best.",,Anonymous,Romance

I've seen this film twice in it's full length, and both times, I repeated the same words over and over again: ""THIS IS Unbelievable! HOW DID THEY DO THAT?!"" Singin' in the Rain is perfect; it is not only a spectacular school example of how a musical should be made, but is also the most romantic film I've ever seen; love is in the air when Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds interact. To focus on the ""smaller"" characters, I've never seen anything like Lina Lamont and Cosmo Brown; the mere line said by Julie Hagen, in that wonderful, unbelievable voice: ""What do they think I am? Dumb or something?""! And amazing Donald O'Connor as the hilarious Cosmo who dances up the walls and pulls stunt-tricks I'd never imagined; what would this movie be without him?

Donald O'Connor is excellent as Kelly's best Friend Cosmo, as id Debbie Reynolds as the star struck fan who falls in love with Kelly. Great performances are also given by Jean Hagen as the ditzy blonde and Cyd Charise as the mysterious dancer in the fabulous 13 minute Broadway Melody Ballet. There is no point during this film where you feel like you want to skip to the next chapter on your DVD, every moment is brilliant, and it is a shame that it is not in top 10 of the Imdb's list.

"A Celebration of Moving Pictures, via the Musical...","It is amazing how a movie such as SINGIN' IN THE RAIN can hit all the right notes, epitomize a genre, and paint an important picture of the most innovative of times in Hollywood: the evolution of silent films to talking ones.  There are 'films' and there are 'movies', as George Lucas likes to say.  This is a 'movie',  a popcorn movie, that is filled frame by frame with fabulous performances, beautiful technicolor, and period songs that will be remembered forever.  Directed by Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly, also its star, this movie musical was made on the coattails of Kelly's previous hit, AN AMERICAN IN PARIS, which won best picture of 1951.  It was only meant to capitalize on that heavily honored favorite.  Not only did it capitalize, it transcended all expectations and has become one of America's most loved and important works of art.The main trio of actors, Kelly, Donald O'Connor, and a young and cute Debbie Reynolds, are perfectly cast in what is really a perfect 'movie'.  Their characters work for Monumental Pictures, actually MGM, and the studio boss is ""L. F. Simpson"", representing MGM boss L. B. Mayer.  Silents rule the silver screen, but, this is 1927, and Warner Bros. has released THE JAZZ SINGER, the first ever talking picture.  It becomes the craze and ""Simpson"" wants to jump onto the bandwagon of sound as soon as possible.  With this premise, we see how studios changed gears and utilized the new 'talkie' technology. One problem: many of the actors and actresses looked great but did not sound fit for the new regime.  Jean Hagen symbolizes the countless actors who lost their jobs because of the new technology.  She can't sing a lick and is as dumb as a brick. (Her voice reminded me of ""Susan Alexander's"" from CITIZEN KANE)  Dialogue coaches are brought in and the studio system is revolutionized.  Not without some hilarious screenings of poorly synched sound pictures that almost has Kelly's career disappearing.The musical numbers brilliantly relay the movie's story of loss and change, but there is never a sour note.  Two sequences stand out.  Kelly twirling in the rain, of course, and O'Connor's Chaplin-esque turn in a stunning virtuoso mix of dance and slapstick during ""Make 'em Laugh"".  Watch this sequence over and over.  You will not believe your eyes.  The grand ""Broadway Ballet"" scene is wonderful at giving us Busby Berkeley-type choreography and Technicolor illuminates the fake facades of a skeleton-like stage of New York City.  The switch from silence to sound is quietly told by the song and dance.  The writers even managed to get quite a few rips on the industry as a whole, especially the false relationships presented to the tabloid journalists to boost image.  This is ironic considering Louis B. Mayer condemned director Billy Wilder for his dark and bitter take on Hollywood just 2 years before in SUNSET BOULEVARD.Don't miss SINGIN' IN THE RAIN.  It ranks alongside the greatest ever made for a reason.  See for yourself (and crank up the sound and color) !",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Gotta Dance"" drags??","I don't really understand the user comments saying that ""Gotta Dance"" drags on!  That is outrageous!Not only was Gene Kelly one of the most captivating dancers, but he was an awe-striking choreographer and director as well!  The man knew dancing AND how to present dancing!!The sequence tells of the trials of the young dreamer in flawless beauty, like a soliloquy without words, but in motion and mood.  The colours in these scenes are like that of an oil painting, beautiful in their brilliance, style, and emotion.  Charisse and Kelly bring ""Singin'..."" to a delight of mood and subtlety; possibly to never happen again on celluloid!Perhaps it is too much a forgotten art form in today's movies, but of its own genre, ""Gotta Dance"" is a true work of absolute excellence!  Does that mean because it is ""too ballet"" for audiences that it should be said to ""drag on?""

Gene Kelly is obviously an amazing dancer, but, one should not overlook the equally amazing Donald O'Conner, who simply stops the show with ""Make Em Laugh"".

Singin' AND Dancin' in the rain and all sorts of other weather conditions too!,"I don't know what it is about him, and I have tried to like him, but Gene Kelly really just doesn't do it for me. I was even trying to checkout his backside and package while watching this, but it was inconclusive, although I would imagine that he had a great butt?
He is obviously very talented, you can see that he puts the hours in too and I don't dispute that at all, but there is just something a bit smug about him, although I'd be smug as well if I could even walk as fast as he can dance.Donald O'Conner on the other hand is just great. Funny, endearing and he just seems to be enjoying himself. He really should have had more work from this film alone.Debbie Reynolds is lovely, but you can sometimes see that she is doing everything she can not to muck up. She does sing well too, it's hard to believe, with that voice, that she is supposed to have given birth to Grace Adler in Will & Grace (If you know, you know).Overall the film is enjoyable and covers the interesting topic of the changeover to talking pictures and everyone gives their best.It is clear that some of the numbers, that bear no relevance to the plot whatsoever, were thrown into flesh the film out. In particular ""Gotta Dance"", especially the individual piece with Cyd Charrisse, but it can be forgiven as the dance numbers are so beautifully choreographed and so well performed.It probably doesn't rate that highly for me up against other musicals, because of my distaste for Gene, but this cannot be helped.

What a wonderful feelin'!,"What a wonderful feelin'! There is no other movie that will brighten up a cloudy day more than 'Singin' In the Rain'. A classic movie musical, complete with comedy, romance, and a full-length Broadway Ballet, 'Singin' In the Rain' is an enjoyable watch. The story features Don Lockwood, (Gene Kelly) a young, romantic, 'swashbuckling star of the silver screen' who rose to fame via a lucky break, after living the trials and tribulations of a vaudeville hoofer/musician, accompanied by his lifelong best friend, Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor). After a flashy world premier, Don is nearly suffocated by adoring fans, and narrowly escapes by jumping from a tour bus into the car of the unsuspecting Kathy Seldon (Debbie Reynolds), a cute, talented dancer/actress, and not only finds himself falling into the passenger seat, but falling for her as well. Throughout the film, he and his leading lady, the very stunning, not so cunning, Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are presented with the challenge of switching from the over-dramatic silent films to the new, hip talkies. The production studio then attempts to transform their current film, 'The Dueling Cavalier' staring Don and Lina, into a vocalized picture. Donald, who has had vocal training, can easily surpass this new feat, but the lovely Lina has a voice that would rival a banshee's. After the humiliating sneak preview airs for theaters, and only a few months until the world premier, our three heroes undergo converting the 'Cavalier' into a musical, and superimposing Kathy's exquisite pipes over Lina's screechy squeals in an attempt to save their careers.

Jean Hagen is the funniest actress ever as Lina Lamont!,"This film has everything a fan of musicals, particularly those of the really great years, could ask for.  Donald O'Connor is at his peak, Jean Hagen is remarkable as Lina Lamont, and Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds do a superb job in their parts.

Debbie and Gene Shine Like the Stars They Are!,"An American Classic, I don't think there's anyone who doesn't know the first four lines to ""Singin' In The Rain'.""  It's not only an absolutely hilarious movie, but there is wonderful chemistry amongst the entire cast, the charming Don as played by Gene Kelly, the talented, bubbly Kathy as played by Debbie Reynolds, the jealous Lina played by Jean Hagen, big time exec R.F. Simpson played by Millard Mitchell, and comedic best friend Cosmo played by Donald O'Connor.  The musical numbers are FANTASTIC, the choreography and voice is great!

And I can stand it!,"This is one of the best movies I have seen. Yes, it was made in the 50's. And yes, it is a little cheesy. But this is so on the floor funny, I couldn't believe how much I was laughing. The musical itself is very wonderful. The songs are very catchy and you find yourself singing to them. And the actors are absolutely wonderful. They got into their characters just right. Gene Kelly was beyond words that I could describe in his opening number ""Singing in the Rain"". This dancing was astonishing. And the story is perfect. I couldn't think of anything more to say than this is one of the best musicals. I would highly recommend this.

Charming and wonderfully made musical & dancing extravaganza,"1st watched 12/21/2002 - 8 out of 10(Dir-Gene Kelly & Stanley Donen): Charming and wonderfully made musical & dancing extravaganza with a background built on the movie-maker's entrance to talkies.  What makes this movie unique is it's wonderfully staged numbers from ""Singin in the Rain"" to wonderfully funny songs with Kelly and Donald O'Conner.  Kelly has a knack for using props and he does this with wonderful results especially in the use of water for the title track.  Oh, if life, we're only as perfect as a musical such as this(then we truly would be singing and dancing in rain, snow, sleet or hail).  Movie magic definetly puts us in this place for this feature which is what gave this picture such a broad appeal and will make it last for a long time in movie history.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

I have the script at home and it's brilliant to read as well. I can honestly say, that when feeling sad this is the movie I put in my VCR (sorry no DVD yet)! Gene Kelly is the best.

THE great movie musical of all time.,"This is the one that they will all be compared to. Incomparable camera and acting, beautiful music, funny, touching, silly, this movie sets the standard for all musicals before or since. Nothing comes close, in my opinion. The plot, such as it is, is about a bunch of kids ""putting on a show!"" during the birth of talkies, and of course two of them fall in love.

The finest musical ever made,"This  has been described as the finest musical ever made. With Kelly, Reynolds and O'Connor adding comedic and musical talent to the Comden and Green book and score, how could it miss? This is a movie about the movie industry as it turned from silent to talking pictures.The most memorable scene in the movie has Gene Kelly splashing in and out of puddles, dancing and singing in the rain.  A young Debbie Reynolds ,new to Hollywood,  becomes a star before our eyes.

How rare!  A thoroughly enjoyable musical!,"Not being a fan of the Musical genre, when I come across a musical film that I enjoy, it's pretty much an anomaly.  `Singin' in the Rain' is one of those exceptions, because it is not only immensely enjoyable, but it is sarcastic and intelligent as well.  `Singin' in the Rain' stars Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds and is a romantic comedy about the advent of the talking picture in 1920's Hollywood.  While a lot of the jokes are over the top and biting, one can't help but imagine that this is probably a fairly accurate portrayal of the hysteria over talkies and the scramble by the studios to compete.Probably the most striking thing about `Singin' in the Rain' is the unbelievable talent, particularly the performances of O'Connor and Kelly. When they start dancing and doing their shtick, I'm suddenly ten years old again and grinning like a fool at the screen.  There are few films that make me laugh out loud, and often, but this film is one of them.  One of the very few criticisms I would have about this film is the scene with Gene Kelly (`Gotta Dance!') toward the end of the film that is about twenty minutes long and pretty much grinds the film to a screeching halt for me.  Until this (unbearably long) musical number, the film is moving at a really quick pace, but it takes a few minutes after this scene for the film to pick up steam again in time for the hilarious conclusion.  I'm not sure what the reasoning was behind the decision to put such a long and displaced number in the film, but if the intent was to show the irony of Hollywood, etc. I'm sure they could have been a bit more concise about it.  (And still showcase Cyd Charrise's amazing legs!)It takes a lot for a comedy, and especially a musical comedy at that, to turn me into a drooling fangirl, but `Singin' in the Rain' does that every time to me.  This is a feel-great movie that is truly a fantastic classic.--Shelly",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
All Together and in Pieces,"The story is a bit silly, but it's funny. I remember a diction coach in college, working with beautiful young women, to try to get them to pronounce the simplest words. This story revolves around this issue. It takes this simple plot and then explodes. Wonderful production numbers. Wonderful characters. Wonderful songs. Each one delivered in an imaginative way with incredible charm. The title tune is a part of Americana with Gene Kelley stomping through the gutters in on of the most incredibly choreographed moments ever. Also, the ""Good Mornin'"" song is great. I could go on, but this is one of those movies that you can turn on any time and wait. It doesn't even matter if you see the rest of the movie. Each number can stand on it's own, but, more importantly, it progresses the story.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

What a pity,What a pity that Donald O'Connor and Gene Kelly never made another movie musical together (not counting 'That's Entertainment').  The possibilities are endless.

Singing in the Rain is simply put perfect I can't think of any element I didn't like the singing, dancing humour and characters are all bright breezy and uplifting. The affectionate lampooning of 20's Hollywood is spot on and my favourite scene goes not to the the most famous piece of musical history but to Kelly's dignity always dignity speech with visual highlights of how he's character really made it as a star. I must have seen this movie about 20 times now and I can always sit through another screening and find a new favourite line or scene and that's the mark of something special.I could go on but all I really need to add is just see it 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Funny and iconic,"It's 1920s silent movie era Hollywood. Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) and Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) are the biggest stars of Monumental Pictures. Their public persona is a loving couple but in reality, he hates her and can't get rid of the clingy Lina. Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) is his piano playing childhood friend. Don meets Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) as he jumps into her car getting away from adoring fans. They meet again when she jumps out of a cake at a company party. Monumental's boss R.F. Simpson (Millard Mitchell) is blindsided by the success of talking picture ""The Jazz Singer"" and he tries to jump start his entry with Don and Lina. Cosmo Brown becomes the new music director. It's a struggle to do something new and worst of all, it's a struggle for the self-obsessed and delusional Lina with the horrible voice. The first attempt ends in a laughable disaster. The trio decides to change it into a musical with Kathy dubbing for Lina.The moment that Jean Hagen starts talking is the most hilarious thing. She's a real gut buster. Gene Kelly is a cad and a very likable one. Donald O'Connor is solid in being the nice guy second fiddle. His dancing is so energetic. Debbie Reynolds is completely adorable. The songs are incredible and so catchy. The dancing is iconic. Most importantly, the story is actually funny and compelling.

An all time Classic!,"Singin' In The Rain is a film that I come across through a context subject of Film and Interpretation in my degree in Business at RMIT.  It it is university policy that each students undertakes 3 units totally irrelevant to their degree with the intention of broadening ones greater knowledge of the world.  I am delighted by this films story line, it offers the viewers so much and given the period in which it was filmed, it would have to be up there with the best produced movies for that era.  The dancing is fantastic, the synchrinisation is perfect, each song neatly entailing a story, a theme. As a movie to study, Singin' in the Rain has provided me with many issues and topics that I have been able to recognise and follow throughout the movie, noting the significance of each song and dance to the story line.

Singin' in the Rain deserves all the accolades it gets and more!,"""What a glorious feeling I'm happy again!"" That's the feeling I got watching this again on DVD-after 30 years of last seeing it. Gene Kelly's title number is sublime and deserves it's iconic status. Donald O'Connor deserves his place in film musical history by his ""Make 'Em Laugh"" number alone. (Never mind that the song is a partial steal from Cole Porter's ""Be a Clown"".) Young Debbie Reynolds does well with such polished hoofers. Jean Hagen is hilarious as the vain and egotistical movie star. The songs by Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed, who's also the producer, are entertainingly performed. And the direction by Kelly and Stanley Donen is just perfect not to mention the original screenplay by Betty Comden and Adolph Green! Nothing more to say except, Singin' in the Rain is indeed perhaps the greatest movie musical ever made! P.S. Great commentary on the track of the DVD in which Ms. Reynolds intros various members of cast and crew and others making their comments. Oh, and it's a shame it was only nominated for two Oscars-none for Best Picture: Ms. Hagen for Best Supporting Actress and Lennie Hayton for Scoring of a Musical Picture. At least Donald O'Connor got a Golden Globe (as Best Actor-Musical or Comedy) for it. The eventual winner for Best Picture at the Academy Awards for 1952 was The Greatest Show on Earth which I'm reviewing next...",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Still captures the magic....... but little else,"Lets be honest, Singin in the Rain hasn't stood the test of time very well. The jokes just aren't funny and are oudated. Compared to todays standards, the acting is disgraceful. The songs are very dated. But, strangely enough, this is still one of the best MGM musicals. The beauty lies in the exhuberant set design. Particularly in the Broadway fantasy scene. The colours and lights bounce off the screen and makes you want to be there. The title song's set is still colourful, so, despite its flaws (and there are plenty of them) this is still enjoyable, and not just for critical snobs. 7.9 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Simply Amazing,"Being that the is the first musical I've seen it is hard to say that this is the best, but I must say that it was an incredible movie, and must see for movie lovers. The originality of Gene Kelley and his dance scores is just simply put,  `amazing.' As the director and major character of the movie, Kelley makes this film come alive. The plot line, based around a silent film movie actress forced to begin making talking pictures, is an inviting and amusing one that keeps you coming back for more. With such talented actors as Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds it's hard to find flaws in the casting directors picks. O'Connor's antics and awesome dance routines make him unforgettable. The role that he plays as Cosmo Brown, Don Lockwood's sidekick, is very well acted. The chemistry between O'Connor and Kelley is well rehearsed. The beautiful Debbie Reynolds, who plays the young Kathy Sheldon, is also stunning. In the beginning of the film she picks up Lockwood so he can retreat from the crazy crowd that is chasing after him. She pretends to know little about him and his impressive career, but we later find out she has seen a great deal of his films. Lina Lamont, who is the silent movie actress, is so realistically played by Jean Hagen. She is the gorgeous blond bombshell that is certainly not hard on the eyes but whose tone of voice could just pierce your ears. This movie is just such wonderfully directed and almost effortlessly made movie. I would suggest it to anyone in for classic movie and great time.",,Anonymous,Romance
A delight for film fans,"Story of a silent film hearthrob's uneasy transition into stardom in the ""talkie"" era is spiced with the cream of N.H. Brown's MGM library crop.  The dance sequences are superb, featuring Charisse as the ""dream girl"".  But what really makes the film is the real chemistry and well-developed (within the limited time available) love story.  Comden and Green have provided a very nice script, and the photography and directing are excellent.The song ""Make 'em Laugh"" is a blatant rip-off of Cole Porter's ""Be A Clown"" (written for the Freed unit only a few years before), and all the other music is from the 30s, so this lack of originality is the film's only real fault.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A lovely, great film, worth watching by just about anybody.","This was not my first film starring Gene Kelly, but it had a good light to it and I very much enjoyed it. :-) It has fantastic dancing from Gene Kelly and Donald O' Connor, an expected but lovely storyline, wonderful characters, good themes to the plot (such as the one of the main characters starting out as stunt men and struggling through the beginning of ""talkie"" films), memorable and likable songs and a shiny MGM quality no longer made in films. If there is one thing I am slightly negative about ""Singin' in the Rain"", it is that the horrible woman is so horrible and has a very irritating voice.In this film, we meet the film star Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and his (sort of) fiancée Lina Lamont. Trying to escape hordes of fans aware of his fame and desperate for an autograph, he finds himself in a woman stranger's (Debbie Reynolds) car. She is quite impertinent about the way he is behaving, partly because she does not watch films and does not realize Don Lockwood is famous. He tries to explain to her he is an ""actor"" and basically she replies, ""I'm an actress, but I act on the stage."" She tries as quickly as possible to deposit Don out of her car, who has already decided he is in love with her and not Lina. We meet his friend Cosmo Brown, who is very close to Don and for the characters mentioned above, there is later plenty to be dancing and singing about..!Highly recommended to whole families of people who like musicals, absolutely fantastic dancing, quite funny films and romance films. A real classic, enjoy ""Singin' in the Rain""! :-)",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Singin' in the Rain (1952),"It is really hard for a musical to grab my attention. Not only did I thoroughly enjoy Singin' in the Rain, my favorite parts of it were the musical numbers. Admittedly, Donald O'Connor & Gene Kelly are magnificent dancers. Make 'em laugh is simultaneously a jaw-dropping routine, and a work of absolute comedy, and their duo dance scene in the voice training studio is unbelievably well done. The one routine that, while also very well made, didn't really fit in, was the one towards the end. Not only did it feel way too long, it was also out of step with the rest of the film.Beyond just the dancing, the film was topical and interesting in plot as well. Even without the music, a movie about the advent of sound in cinema and the differences in acting and performance that came with it is an interesting an original topic to explore.",,Anonymous,Romance
A GREAT musical treat,"What everyone says - a fun look at the movement from the 'silent movie' era to the sound movies. There are SO MANY fun scenes, like 'moses supposes', etc. And not the least of which is the title song with the beautiful dancing of Kelly.The most surprising is that Jean Hagen did not win 'best supporting' for her role. Just try to imitate her lines. So great and amusing. Of course everybody talks! What's the big deal??The movie is a true classic and everyone should see it. Aside from Kelly, there is the wonderful O'Connor and a very young Debbie Reynolds, who worked so hard on the dancing.

"Amusing premise, spectacular dancing","Truly a ""classic"" and I can't believe I'd never seen it. The premise is fun... a silent film duo look to make the jump to ""talkies"" except one has a terrible voice and no real performance skills. Enter the talented (but unknown) chorus girl to dub her voice and help save the day.Yes, it's a bit dopey and farcical at times, but who cares? Kelly, O'Connor, Reynolds, and Hagen all shine in their roles, with almost effortless ease and sincerity. And yes, the story seems to wander on occasion just to accommodate a couple of song and dance numbers that don't factor at all in the plot, but the songs and dance ARE the stars of the film, so this is excusable. In the end, we're left with a cute Hollywood love story, and a ""triumph of good"" tale, wrapped up in a magical package of dance and glitz, and that's plenty. An 8.5 bumped up to a 9 because the dancing is great, and Kelly's ""Singin in the Rain"" sequence is iconic.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
CSUN Student Review of Singin' in the Rain (1952),"I have lost track of how many times I've seen this movie but each time I see it is as if I have never seen it before. I have always loved this movie and it always feels new whenever I watch it. I gave this film a rating of 10 stars because I believe it really is that good. The music, the choreography, the story, and the cast of very talented people are what make this film so memorable and fun. Sunset Boulevard was a film released two years before Singin' in the Rain, and that film was a more serious and high-stakes take on the topic of Hollywood transitioning to talkies from silent films. I prefer the take that Singin' in the Rain had, because even though there was drama surrounding the transition to talkies, this film made it approachable and entertaining. Having this kind of story be told through a musical is kind of genius, because it showed 1) how far Hollywood had come from the silent era, and 2) made the telling of the transition to new technologies more colorful and optimistic. I have always loved musicals, whether on the stage or through film. Singin' in the Rain, in my opinion, is one of the best movie musicals of all time. I know that some people aren't fans of musicals and they say things like ""how do these characters know the dance if they have never rehearsed it"" or ""why are they randomly breaking into song"", but I love how there seem to be no rules when it comes to musicals. Singin' in the Rain would not be as famous or iconic as it is if it wasn't a musical.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very sweet,"Everyone loves this movie, there is no way that you cannot. Like The Wizard of Oz, it shows that film can be a creation of positive creation and we don't need horrible violence to have a film be considered great.I think what's also worth noting is that Kelle had a 103 Degree fever when he danced and sang in this picture, it shows the effort that was put into film back in the day. The determination is striking, even though he probably should have taken a sick day, or hired Malcolm McDowell.It's also great to watch this with our grandparents, because it is a safe-for-work film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Easily my favorite musical, a contender for favorite movie too.","""Singin' in the Rain"" is a wonderful film. It's beautifully shot, the songs are memorable and the dance choreography is fantastic. Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds have perfect chemistry together and are all terrific physical and comedic performers. It's really amazing to see them singing and dancing together and because the film maker knew how talented these people were, the editing during these scenes is sparse, allowing you to really admire everything with few cuts. I had seen the titular segment where Gene Kelly is ""singin' in the rain"" and still it contained so much joy that it felt fresh to me. That's an iconic moment that makes the movie worth seeing all by itself there are many other great segments, like the ""Make 'em Laugh"" sequence, where Donald O'Connor does an impromptu number, all on his own without a stunt double and ""Good Morning"" where we get to see the three leads together celebrating a breakthrough. You really get to see that these people were amazing physical performers and it makes you want to get up and practice their moves in the hopes that you could be as good. There's so much energy in the film that it's a real delight to see. It's sure to please you and make you smile, it's laugh-out-loud funny and I also enjoyed seeing the lighthearted insight on the world of filmmaking as the talkies started replacing the silent films. Even if you're not interested in musicals, it's hard to imagine someone not enjoying the movie. (Theatrical cut on the big screen, August 19, 2012)",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

This is a wonderful way to escape reality and dive into the magical world of movies.

"Dignity, always dignity","In his own words Gene Kelly said that this one will last. Not all of them do as films age but Singin in the Rain will stand the test of time.It is not a perfect film, it does have flaws in its story but it is a gold plated classic and according to Kelly it is all true, these things happened.Kelly presumably meant the various incidents in Hollywood relating to the transition from silent to sound. A subject of the more recent Oscar winning silent film The Artist itself based on the Don Lockwood character played by Kelly. The Artist is set in an alternate universe where Don is washed up when sound arrives not Lina.Don Lockwood is a song and dance man who worked his way up to be a movie star from being a stuntman. Along with hyperactive Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) who these days would be regarded as the gay best friend.Lockwood and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are formidable box office stars and everyone thinks they are an item. In truth he detests her which makes you think that if they have not been together for all these years. Then who have they been with all along or were they living like monks?After a film premiere Lockwood literally drops into Kathy Selden's (Debbie Reynolds) car. She is a wannabee stage actress and he is immediately attracted to her.On the horizon is talking pictures and this makes (as in The Artist) the stars of today 'has beens' unless they quickly adapt to sound, because the kind of films they have been making so far now look laughably bad.Worse as they quickly try to make their new film as a talkie, Lina has difficulty talking into a microphone.

A Joy,"Bright, colorful, energetic, and fun. What more could you ask for from the movie called the best musical ever? I don't know about that specifically, but I do know that Singin' in the Rain is a hodgepodge of a film that shouldn't work at all but works marvelously. Built around a series of songs that the studio had the rights to, the story of the transition from silent to sound movies is told with such innocent and infectious energy that it's nearly impossible to resist.It's the silent era of movies and Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont are the king and queen of dashing romantic adventure. The movie starts with a fun jolt as Don and Lina get pulled into an interview on the red carpet premier of their newest movie where Don describes his life story. The contrast between the urbane and suave story that Don describes and the rickety rags to riches story we see are a wonderful source of comedy. Don's description of the finest music and dancing schools that he and his best friend Cosmo went to while we see them as boys scrapping for nickels after a quick tap number in a pool hall is delightful, but it's when we get to a full number from the two in the flashback that we see the movie's first glimpse at the source of its most consistent fun: the song and dance. Young Don and Cosmo dancing to ""Fit as a Fiddle"" with great physical acuity and wonderfully precise comic timing around sight gags like Don accidentally taking Cosmo's bow and Cosmo needing to get it back while still dancing.All through this interview we see Lina pop up, but we never hear her speak. Their relationship is a public relations creation with nothing behind it (though Lina still doesn't seem to understand that), but her biggest problem is that her voice is steeped in some kind of screechy Chicago accent that goes wildly against her film image of a debonaire lady (Jean Hagen had a rather deep voice in real life). This is not a problem as long as Don and the Monumental Pictures PR department can keep Lina away from a microphone during promotional appearances. She chafes under the stricture, but what else can she do?On the way to the after party, Don gets mobbed and jumps in the car of an unsuspecting young woman, Kathy. She pretends to have no idea who Don is unlike any other girl Don meets, and the new treatment keeps her on his mind even after she shows up to the party as a dancing girl, throws a pie in Lina's face that was intended for Don, and gets fired from the Coconut Grove.This is all the stage setting for the great change that is the talkies.In a movie full of joys, it's fun to watch the growing pains of the talkie era, especially after I dove head first into it with my Hitchcock viewing experience. The voice coaches, the giant box that held the camera and sound equipment, the halting efforts to get microphones where they could actually pick up sound, and the general poor quality of the early sound entirely captured on set all ring true and are just amusing. A note, though, almost no one used records to record sound because of the synching problems the movie shows. Still, it's a great source of fun and leads to Cosmo's great idea after the wonderful ""Good Morning"" number.You see, Kathy, whom Don found on the lot as a chorus girl and gave a better job to, has a better singing and speaking voice than Lina, so Cosmo imagines that by using the magic of movies they can replace Lina's voice with Kathy's so they can help turn the disastrous new movie, The Dueling Cavalier, into a musical called The Dancing Cavalier.Now, the movie's greatest charm really begins and ends with its music and dance. Gene Kelly, who co-directed the picture, knows exactly how to film this kind of dance, and it's to pull the camera back and just let the performers dance. From Donald O'Connor jumping off walls in the desperate to make you laugh ""Make 'Em Laugh"" to the trio of O'Connor, Kelly, and Debbie Reynolds going up and down stairs in ""Good Morning"" to Kelly solo sweeping through the downpour in ""Singin' in the Rain"" we get these immaculately choreographed and executed sequences that show off the physical talents of the performers, thrilling as much as entertaining. It's all in the service of a well-natured ribbing of Hollywood that obviously loves the industry and town that it hails from.Acting performances are winning all around. Gene Kelly is his charming self as Don. Debbie Reynolds is a sweet spitfire as Kathy. Jean Hagan is delightful of Lina (a role that won her an Oscar). Donald O'Connor is a wonderful physical comedian as Cosmo with flips in ""Make 'Em Laugh"" and marvelous facial contortions in the lead up to ""Moses Supposes"". Even the supporting cast gets into it all along the way.I suppose my only complaint of the film is the ""Broadway Melody"" number. It's far from bad, but it feels a little long considering what it's supposed to do. It's supposed to represent the new opening to The Dancing Cavalier, but it seems rather completely removed from it, encompassing its own story that doesn't really seem to be about leading up to the action. It's a big excuse for a number that's big and wonderful to watch with its own narrative flow, but that flow kind of breaks up the flow of the overall picture. Still, I think it's better placed and used than the ""American in Paris"" ballet at the end of An American in Paris.Singin' in the Rain is classic Hollywood doing what it did best: bringing together talent onto a project that probably shouldn't exist in the first place. It's a deliriously fun accident of a movie that looks lovingly at Hollywood's own past and gives the current audience a fun time.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Audience are all singin' in the rain!,"Since the time I first began viewing films with a certain passion, there haven't been too many- in fact, very few- musicals that have impressed me and lent me to revisit them appraisingly. Firstly, very few of them actually contain interesting characters and subject matter with Les Miserablés being a recent, remarkable musical/example. Then, there was the whole eventual boredom that would emanate from the film's constant dancing, singing, and stylistic and unnatural reliance on choreographic performances. Fortunately, in this case, Singin' in the Rain managed to surprise me with its sheer quality and entertaining nature.Attuned to what I previously claimed, the picture features incredibly charming characters with Don Lockwood (played by the great Gene Kelly) being a very clear exemplar. Normally, Hollywood films in that era would portray relationships in largely superficial and (negatively) theatrical fashion. The couple would persistently utter hackneyed lines to one another. Some might find them beautiful, but I find them horribly clichéd- that is unless the pairing has a charisma and charm to them that's able to separate the two from the generic Hollywood romance that was customarily depicted on-screen during those times.In this instance, Don Lockwood and Kathy Selden (a rare beauty played by Debbie Reynolds) commence their unorthodox relationship with a stir of skepticism in which Kathy doesn't quickly wrap herself up in the famous star's arms. Her likability and credibility is earned by her resistance to his glamour. This effectively displays her character as strong-willed and alluring- she's not the kind to thoughtlessly sleep with a guy the day she met him because he's a worldwide sensation; no, she's the kind that's hard to obtain. At this point, the male audience (or, at least, me) immediately find themselves resonating with Don because I'm sure most of us have come across a woman we painstakingly loved but were unable to attract without great effort. This fascinating relationship follows in a similar manner throughout the film until they realize the appeal of one another. In sum, the terrific chemistry between the two characters is self-evident from the absolute start, which is also wondrously contributed to by exceptional acting performances.On another note, the soundtrack is quite delightful and classic in its melody and rhythm and provides for astounding choreography. With that being said, though the feature is predominantly entertaining and clever, it slightly loses its pace with its middle act in which we're introduced to non-stop singing and dancing. The intriguing story is compromised and temporarily paused while the filmmakers use this precious time to showcase the musical performances as this is a musical at the end of the day. Unfortunately, that particular segment (prolonged, indeed) lowered the film's overall quality and troubled it with a highly noticeable flaw. When I was discussing the unrealistic look of musicals at certain moments towards the beginning of my review, this is exactly what I meant by their unattractive aspects. When all is said and done, Singin' in the Rain was a pleasing experience, and although it was considerably hurt by its second act, I hope my memory of the film will be dominated by its satisfying plot, characters, music, and cinematically historical significance, which all drastically overshadow that one meandering element.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

The jazz singer,"This is one of the most purely exhilarating films you will see in a lifetime of movies, pure Hollywood royalty. You didn't need me to tell you though, so let's talk about something else.Visually, the thing is as magnificent and minutely controlled as Kubrick's 2001, as vibrantly colored as The Red Shoes, with a weave of self-reference layered deep enough to make Peter Greenaway sit down and write a list about it.Of course the whole idea behind the thing is that it is a movie about the makings of a movie, the one we have come to see. Warners pioneered this in the early 30's, and they had Busby Berkeley staging wonders, but this goes beyond.Why the film amazes to this day, beyond its technical credentials, I think has all to do with the spontaneous engineering of the design. How it has been choreographed to dance around the burdens of a thinking mind and speak directly to the eye, the pull smoothed over so that it appears completely natural. I shudder to think what painstaking effort must have went into choreographing the lights and camera and individual performances, and then timing everything to flow at once.It is a perfect accomplishment in how we're engaged to dance; first with the fictional space as though it were real, but gradually, getting to know the steps of the spell, coming to understand that we were only using the fictional to hover closer to what is real and matters. Love in our case, the glorious feeling.Consider for example the scene where Don takes Kate to an empty studio lot and begins to arrange an illusion around her, movie lights, wind machine, painted horizon in the back, but all arranged to allow him to speak about a love that is true. They erupt in spontaneous dance, adding to the illusion arranged for us. It doesn't make a lick of sense why they would suddenly dance, but we absorb naturally because the spark is natural.Consider how love for this woman transforms the entire film in production. The many times that characters avail themselves truly while framed inside a fiction, before a camera or in front of a screen. How the plot of The Jazz Singer is cleverly mirrored in the plot of a man pursuing his dream about dancing.",,Anonymous,Romance

The singing in the rain is another one of my favorite dance numbers but overall I enjoyed all the dance numbers but those two are the top on my list.

You Could Always Dance your Pain Away,"A musical about movies and musicals. It can't get better than that. Now it's official. Musicals are definitely my favourite genre. I could watch everyday for the rest of my life people (or just Gene Kelly) dance and sing and play on screen, without any particular hint of story or structure or anything. Dance, music, acting are alone already very powerful tools to express emotion. Imagine putting all of that together. You have something that is immensely potent, emotional, joyful, so much that tears were falling down my face just watching these incredible actors dance. But it's not just that. It's the jazz, it's the charleston, it's the orchestra, it's the choreography, it's the smiles, the facial expressions, radiant, funny, happy. It's the characters, with an incredible chemistry on screen. It's (also) the plot, a joy for us cinephiles, a miracle, a musical in the Hollywood studios! About the fate of actors after the sound transition. God bless those who invented musicals, all those geniuses, like Gene Kelly, who made sure that this genre would get all the praise and success and love that it deserved (and still deserves!). Those who don't appreciate musicals don't appreciate life, or simply don't listen to music. I don't know what I would do with my life if musicals weren't around the corner to lift my spirits up, reminding me that you could always sing or dance your pain away.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

While Gene Kelly's title number is the most famous, Donald O'Connor's Make 'em Laugh performance is a bit mind-boggling. This fine cast is highlighted by the hilarious career peak of Jean Hagen. She is a horrid delight. This film is a must if you have an interest in musicals or simply great American filmmaking.

"He did indeed, sing in the rain","It would appear it is time for another completely uncontroversial review of a film no one's heard of.If I'm to be completely blunt, with a lot of older films that I end up not thinking much of, I can at least understand why they were so beloved at the time, but musicals were absolutely everywhere in Hollywood in the 50's, and other than the music, there's really nothing special about this to me.Honestly, I found myself wishing that Gene Kelly's sidekick was the main character, because he delivers a much better performance, his physicality is really impressive, and crucially, he isn't a complete tool.I think that's likely the crux of the issue here; I just don't like the leads. I think they're both majorly unlikable at varying points, I don't buy their romance, and while it has its funny moments, the script feels fairly bog standard.Sure, certain images are up there as being some of the most iconic in cinema history, and for good reason, and the music is pretty great too, but nothing about the story or characters really clicked with me.I guess I might as well also admit that I've never really been a big fan of classic musicals - the kind where the songs don't really play into the story and the characters just randomly burst into song and dance at the drop of a hat, a) because it's ridiculous, and b) because it always seems to pad the film out rather than add to it.But I seem to be the only person around who doesn't think it's a masterpiece, and we could all use a bit of positivity and learning how to sing in the rain, so don't let me stop you checking out a classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Only Thing Missing is a Couple of Droogs,"I love the title song to Stanley Donen's Singin' in the Rain. The whole scene, with Gene Kelly joyfully relishing in his love for Debbie Reynolds is a pure and simple delight. Yet, strangely enough, it's Malcolm MacDowell and his Droogs' home invasion, assault, and gang-rape in Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange that gives me a pause when I think of SITR.That and the fact that, after it gets off to a rousing, funny, and witty start, Donen and Gene Kelly's musical comes apart at the seams, with one over-long and self-indulgent song-and-dance number after another, eventually causing the movie to become a tedious mess instead of the tender love story it should have been.With all-due attention given to my musical apostasy, I got half way through Singin' in the Rain and started to squirm and harumph, wondering when this damn thing would be over. I started longing for an episode of Don't Forget the Lyrics--at least that's only an hour! SITR just seems to go on and on, heaping on noisy songs, and it's not until the end that Donen and Kelly bring the original story back to its logical start, that of a talented heel who finds character and fulfillment in a nice girl's arms.Singin' in the Rain is a big, bloviating pain in the butt, with one or two great--really great--bits, and a sore butt for sitting through the rest.",,Anonymous,Romance

Dancing Through the Downpour,"From the moment the opening notes of ""Singin' in the Rain"" began, I was instantly transported to a vibrant world of color and joy. I had seen snippets of this film before, but experiencing it in its entirety was like uncovering a hidden treasure. The film's charm lies not just in its catchy tunes and dazzling choreography but in its ability to weave a delightful narrative that reflects a pivotal moment in cinematic history.As I watched Gene Kelly glide across the screen, particularly in the iconic titular scene, I found myself grinning from ear to ear. The sheer joy radiating from his performance is infectious. It's hard not to feel uplifted when he dances in the rain, and I could almost feel the droplets on my own skin, wishing I had the courage to join him in that carefree celebration. The choreography is not just impressive; it feels organic, as if the characters are expressing their emotions through movement rather than forcing a performance.Debbie Reynolds shines as well, bringing a youthful exuberance that complements Kelly's seasoned charm. Their chemistry is palpable, and their interactions are filled with a playful banter that adds depth to their characters. I found myself rooting for them, invested in their journey through the tumultuous transition from silent films to ""talkies."" The subplot of dubbing and the challenges it brings is both humorous and poignant, showcasing the struggles of artists adapting to change.The film is a masterclass in storytelling, using music and dance not as mere embellishments but as integral parts of the narrative. Each song feels perfectly placed, enhancing the emotional stakes rather than detracting from them. Even as someone who typically steers clear of musicals, I found myself swept away by the rhythm and heart of the film.What struck me most was the film's timelessness. It speaks to the resilience of artists and the ever-evolving nature of the film industry. Watching it felt like a celebration of creativity, reminding me why I fell in love with cinema in the first place. ""Singin' in the Rain"" is not just a film; it's an experience that lingers long after the credits roll, leaving you with a smile and perhaps a desire to dance in the rain yourself.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Delectable Film for all Ages,"Singin' in the Rain is a film that will be enjoyed by all ages.  This musical is the only one which my friends and I have truly enjoyed.  It is a humorous film that has talented actors and actresses such as Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor.  Singin' in the Rain was a great movie in the time which it was produced, even though there were some critics who would disagree.  It is a story based in 1927 about a man named Don Lockwood who has yet another film to star in.  Only this time it is a `talkie' which his partner, Lina Lamont, doesn't have the voice for.  It was great how they showed the use of dubbing in films which is used quite often in many films.  Don later falls for a fan of his named Kathy Seldon. This becomes the romantic part of the movie that mostly appeals to older generations.  The film was pretty cool in the tap dancing and musical parts, but the most amusing was the comedy. You don't really see men dancing and singing all the time, most of us are brought up to be masculine and do masculine things, not sing and dance. This is where the great Gene Kelly came in, he made the singing and dancing seem like it was the thing to do. The comedy mostly played by Donald O'Connor, was hilarious.  It was by far the funniest classic musical I've ever seen, and blew everything else in those genres out of the water.  The more technical fascinations with this movie are just as great.  The illusion shot was definitely one of my favorite parts, when Cosmo, played by Donald O'Connor, runs up a wall.  The synchronous sound worked great for the film, and I'm sure it amused the audiences then as it still does now.  As for the illusion and reality part, in reality not many successful actors go for their fans.  Also Jean Hagen who played Lina Lamont, can actually sing and doesn't sound like she has been sucking helium. One thing I have found, is that, if you are ever feeling down or sick, this is a great movie to see to get you going again.",,Anonymous,Romance

Best musical ever. Thanks MGM.,"This movie was recently chosen by British critics as the best musical ever made, and not by accident. The song and dance numbers are elaborately staged and full of energy, the production design is gorgeous and everything looks colorful and lit up brightly in classic MGM fashion with lots of high key lighting effects. No detail was spared and no expense either, on costumes, set pieces. It just looks phenomenal.Also - rare for a musical comedy - the plot is actually worthy of being followed. So many musicals have just enough plot to string the audience along between songs, but this one has a clever, funny story line that plunges briskly ahead, tracking the ups and downs of the coming of sound to the movies. It could have been done as a comedy without the songs and still been a great movie, and how many musicals can say that?More than anything, though, the musical numbers actually fit into the emotional background of the story. Yes, cast members start singing or jigging and music appears from no discernible source - pretty standard for the era - but the numbers are a joyous expression of friendship, a means to express ideas, to mock, to revel in the moment. So many musicals have to contrive reasons to put in song and dance numbers, and sometimes don't even bother with logic and just throw them in anyway. Here, no musical number fails to fit logically or character-wise.This movie is a triumph. Watch it once a year forever.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Beautiful Review in the Form of a Musical,"This wonderful musical showed me how criticism can come from the most varied means, with beautiful music and choreography, singing in the rain shows a somewhat dark side of Hollywood, criticizing everything from this gigantic industry, to the actors themselves who are in it. Themes such as ego, greed and lust are explored in an incredible way, bringing an air of renewal and inspiration to the cinema of the time. I don't like musicals, but after watching this film, I decided to give the genre a chance, I would like to see more shows like this nowadays, but unfortunately a film like this will never be made again, the beauty and depth in the songs from sing in the rain will be difficult to reach.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great musical,This is one of my favourite musicals. All of the songs are so energetic and lively. The characters are relatable and the story goes through a lot of Hollywood history.,8.0,Anonymous,Romance
15 minutes of fame/dance/singing,"No pun intended - the movie has so many things it touches upon, it is almost impossible to mention all of them. It also is able to wink at the audience, show behind the scenes stuff and generally have the theme of duality in it. Seeing one thing, while something else is going on. It begins with the introduction of our main characters. What Gene Kelly is saying, does not always fit with what we see play out in front of us. This is something the movie does throughout ... and in just a great way that ... well even if you don't like musicals, this may be the one you will like.Believe me, I am not or would not call myself a musical kind of guy. But this movie is so good ... how can you not like it. Gene and Donald are looking fabulous - and the 4k version of the movie I watched is exceptional too. Set design, costumes and choreography are next level to say the least. I really liked it and the song and dance numbers ... should I call the tight? Awesome? Amazing? Out of this world? Invent new words to describe them? All of the above is probably the right answer ... and more.Then you have Debbie Reynolds who completes the trio (holy trinity) ... the way they move together when they have dance numbers ... well I won't bore you with more superlatives but it is what it is. And let's not forget about Jean Hagen, who has the toughest job ... ridiculing herself for laughs, but also being the villain, by trying to destroy everything positive and lovely the others built and have done. You may feel for her, because she really wants to excel ... she wants to be loved ... and yet she is denied many times over and over.The movie influenced so many people, dancers and artists in general. And if you watch it, you can see why. The singing (and dancing) in the rain may be the best known of the songs, but you might find at least one other song you will like at least as much as this one ... and Gene never loses any of his charm or his manhood .. you can dance ... anyone can. Singing on the other hand .. but let no one deter you from what you want to be and what makes you happy! 70 plus years on and the movie has not lost its touch ... or a step to use another pun ...",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sheer Perfection!,"This film isn't just the best musical ever, but also the best MOVIE. A definite highlight is the amazing Broadway Melody number with Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse. The first time I saw it  I was sort of reminded of the dance scene in The Mask with Jim Carrey and Cameron Diaz, but this one's way better. I recommend Singin' in the Rain whole-heartedly!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Endless entertainment,"In 1927, Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont are two greatest stars of the Cinema. Lover inside the screen and ""Lover"" outside of it, just because of fans and gossip magazines. But, in fact Don barely tolerate Lina, a definition of a blond.Troubles begin with the period of transition from silent movies to talking pictures. Beside technical problems, screenplays with dialogues, main problem is Lina. Beautiful blonde with horrible voice.In fact I don't like Musical movies at all. But, Singin' in the Rain surprised me. I was surprised with the picture and colors that are great even that this movie was made in 1952. Music is wonderful, as I knew it would be. My favorite one was ""Good Morning""Along with Music and Romance are those Comic moments with Donald O'Conner as Cosmo who reminded me Charlie Chaplin. Funniest guy in the movie! Acting in overall was great with Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds, especially Jean Hagen.Generally speaking, Singin' in the Rain is one of the greatest movie ever, with great acting, directing and script.Combining Music, Romance and Comedy, entertainment is guaranteed.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
In my opinion it is by far the best film ever made.,"The fastest,funniest most musical musical ever. I have watched it countless times and after fifty years it has remained my top favourite film. Every performer in the film right down to the minor players (eg. Kathleen Freeman) all deserve some kind of special Oscar for making this the happiest most uplifting film ever made. Whenever things in life get me down...and I mean really down... I watch ""SINGIN' IN THE RAIN"" and somehow suddenly things don't seem so bad. If they could bottle this film it would be the greatest anti-depressant on the market. In my opinion it deserves more than the highest rating ever. LONG LIVE ""SINGIN' IN THE RAIN"".

TIMELESS FILM THAT MAKES US DANCE EVEN IF ITS RAINING,"Film from 1952 that takes place during the transition from silent to talkies in mid-1927....
We are presented with falsehood and staging that suddenly, with the words appearing, shows us people really who they are... even when the star LINA LAMONT (Jean Hagen) does not speak in the film, whether behind the camera or in front, she is always acting, in the scene or in his real life, all with beautiful direction by Stanley Donen together with the protagonist Gene Kelly.We really see a transformation in the language of broadway, with a lot of respect for theater because we know that there has always been a certain amount of conflict between film and theater actors.A beautiful photograph, it is worth remembering that we are talking about one of the most remembered scenes in the history of cinema when DON LOCKWOOD (Gene Kelly) interacts with the scenery and his tap dancing during the rain. Interaction with the scenery, of course, is part of all musicals, but here it comes in a way that serves as an example for all other subsequent musicals in the history of cinema, especially when COSMO BROWN (Donald Connor), DON's inseparable friend, steals the show and the leading role in a song, solo, in an uncut musical sequence in several scenarios worthy of an Oscar for the main actor, even though he was acting in a supporting role.Well-fitted itinerary,
Such beautiful performances (of course a bit theatrical for the time) with excellent sound work and historical photography...
...A timeless film that makes us dance even if it's raining.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Review,"The story of the film is very, very beautiful. I enjoyed the length of the film. The events were wonderful. I enjoyed the movie. The acting was very wonderful. I enjoyed the acting. The director was very good. The music and colors were the best. The film was similar to me. La la land.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""I've had one motto which I've always lived by: Dignity. Always, dignity."" - Don Lockwood","I feel a bit guilty writing this review given that I'm not a musical guy. So I'm reveiwing a film that I knew I most likely wouldn't like purely because of the genre. Now, although musicals are not my go to when I want to watch something I can admit quality when I see it and Singing in the Rain is a quality film. The story is easy enough to understand and I liked the setting of late 1920s and the rise of ""talkie"" cinema. It was educational. Most of the songs are very memorable, a couple didn't do it for me mind you and the lines or scenes which were trying to be funny ... weren't. The song Make Them Laugh for example, didn't make me laugh. At all. The dance numbers are well thought out and very intense, lots of colour and movement with the actual Singing in the Room sequence my favourite. There was a section in the film which felt out of place and was akin to a dream sequence, it was filmed differently to the rest of the film and I didn't really enjoy the imagery. Debbie Reynolds looked absolutely stunning in her debut film, and it was clear she was going to be a star. I can also see why Gene Kelly was considered one of the best dancers of all time - he had very impressive timing and lots of energy.Final Verdict: I'm not into musicals but as far as musicals go, this was well made with good dance numbers and mostly memorable songs set during an interesting time period. Debbie Reynolds looks stunning and Gene Kelly was a masterful dancer. I may not watch it again but certainly didn't regret watching it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Changing Paradigms, Reinventing Movies.","The next twenty years will interwave cinema, television, special effects, digital arts, animation western/oriental styles, games, graphic novels, creating models we cannot see even so near to ""the Singularity"" as we are.
Last century, between belle époque, art déco, art nouveau, surrealism to dadaïsme, literature from late influences of romanticism through symbolism, passing by magic realism, cubism, Kerouac, Kalo, Kandinsky only to use three of the same as Kino. Cinema has changed its parameters from mute to the first soundtrack experiences reaching this century surpassing THX already.
Singing in the rain is a colorful testimony of a black and white world gaining voice, a crucial period of adapt or stay aside.
Excelente art direction by the main male character and pal, new techniques of post war first big leap.
It was a time of wonders.
And now we can see the twentieth century's masterpieces restored, colour or not, remastered sound Dolby Digital at least.
Like the version I had the privilege of having seen tonight. Not one but Two, (if not the best musicals ever), this marvelous Singing in the rain and George Cukor's 1964 Pygmalion's Musical, with that magical duo and a quality crew like this more than a decade before.
Every day is a day of wonder at the place where dreams came into being, and so many perish.
Singing in the rain is a song most of the old timers sing from the early youth...
It was an honour seeing it remastered.
Congratulations, it's important to light the bright side to deal with ""stuff""...
Let's congratulate once more.
I never get tired to give praise to those who deserve, named or unnoticed but part of the whole...",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fun and memorable,"I'm not usually a fan of musicals, but this was a fun movie to watch nonetheless and I enjoyed it. The music is so strong that it makes up for the unnaturalness that I usually get from musical movies. Multiple were stuck in my head after finishing the film. The narrative was really strong, and the music contributed so well to the storytelling. It was also really interesting to see commentary about filmmaking and Hollywood from that time. Reynolds and Kelly had great chemistry and belivable romance. You are really left with a positive feeling after watching and it makes you want to go about life in a more lighthearted fashion.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great movie,"Great movie, great songs, great plot, great cast. Everything was great although I could do without the ""modern number"" and the Cyd Charisse scene. Way too long and pointless. Otherwise a perfectly creative movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
