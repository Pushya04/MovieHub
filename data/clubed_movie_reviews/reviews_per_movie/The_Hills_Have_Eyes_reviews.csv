Disturbingly creepy,"Let me start by saying that it is a truly disturbingly scary production. Very realistic scenes can satisfy horror enthusiasts. The cast gives a good performance. They seem to realize that they are in a serious horror movie. This leaves a positive impact. The production starts quickly and continues that way. The music played at the opening event signals that a frightening atmosphere will be experienced from the very beginning. I think it is one of the movies that those who like the genre should watch, but as I said, it may be a little disturbing. One of those that will be impressed for a long time.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
If you're in the mood for one of 2006's most brutal movies...,"Shocking. Disturbing. At times hard to watch. All words to describe the horror of being forced to watch Michael Moore take his shirt off. But these terms also accurately describe this brutally vicious upgrade on Wes Craven's 1977 low-budget horror classic.What would you do if you were traveling through the desert and became stranded amongst a group of genetically-mutated freaks who were intent on killing you? You'd probably die. Granted, I would kick all sorts of genetically-mutated butt (not an easy accomplishment when said butt has a foot growing out of it kicking right back), but the average human would be in some major trouble, just like the Carter family.The father looks like he could handle himself in a fair fight, after all he is a detective, but what are three girls, a boy, a cell phone-selling geek, and a pizza place (maybe two of you will get that lame joke) going to do against a bunch of unnaturally strong psychos? How will they survive? Will it be through might or strategy? You'll have to watch the movie to find out. And if you're squeamish then you'll most likely find yourself cringing in your seat and watching with your hands over your eyes. The Hills Have Eyes is a movie that knows exactly what it needs to do to satisfy its target audience, and it does it well.Case in point... I'm not very vocal during movies. I usually don't clap and scream and hoot and holler like most the dorks sitting around me, but there were a couple of scenes where I literally said aloud, ""Ooooooooooh, crap!"" Of course, one of those instances was during a trailer for Phat Girlz, but one scene of violence left my mouth hanging open for about 30 seconds. Then I realized that my mouth was agape like some buffoon, so I quickly closed it.It takes a lot to shock and disturb me these days, so congrats go to The Hills Have Eyes for accomplishing that. It comes at you fast and hard and isn't interested in sugar-coating the violence it's about to serve up. The intensity level starts high and never gives you an opportunity to take a bathroom break. I highly recommend you address any and all bladder issues before the movie begins.For me, the main drawback of the movie was the ""hero."" You can argue that he was more of a ""regular guy"" and not a typical macho hero, but I felt he transitioned a little too quickly from a gun-hating wuss to an ax-wielding killing machine. My hat's off to the dog though; that canine rocked! Easily the coolest dog in a movie since the German Shepherd in The Lost Boys.""I like horror movies, Johnny, but I liked to be creeped out more than being subjected to a lot of gore. Would I like this?"" It's very doubtful. I'll make this as blunt as possible: this is a movie that contains severed body parts, brutal shootings, axes to the head, a person biting off a bird's head and drinking its blood, and disturbing violence to helpless women.If that description turns you off then you know to save your money. However, if that fits your style then the movie will succeed in giving you exactly what you want. But I have to say that if you think this sounds like fun for the entire family then I'll have to decline any invitations to sit down with you for a family dinner.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not bad , but still prefer the original by a mile","What made early Wes Craven movies so special were these eary and daunting atmospheres he was so good in creating ; And this is what Hills Have Eyes 2006 totally lacked. Firstly the music through out the movie was awful and totally clich√© and unfortunately diminished any depth that HHE was trying to show. I did like the nuclear mutant idea , but then seeing them reminded me on how the original HHE villains had way more presence on the screen and they had no make up !!Now I did like the actors , they played their respective roles well The effects were good + I did like how they twisted the original script and added some new ideas instead a complete knock off of the original So my final word not a bad movie , but lacked atmosphere/suspense , which is so important in horror/slasher movies , shame !",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Doug has just become one of my favourite characters ever!,"The Hills Have Eyes? More like the hills have some deformed degenerates who like to call you ""Daddy"" in the middle of the night!Jokes aside, this came as a surprise! To tell you the truth, I never had high regard for campy horrors; to me, they are just okay for passing time, nothing more. Therefore, it goes without saying; that I didn't have many expectations, to begin with. Yet here I'm, mulling over what I just saw and also feeling quite ecstatic following my time with the film.Unlike some of its contemporaries, there is a palpable tension here that they were able to uphold until the end credits started rolling! And trust me, it gets pretty dark in the middle, not to mention, the usage of practical effects and prosthetics took it to a whole new level! Well, all the performances do indeed come off, as you might predict, a bit cheesy, but I have to say I freaking cherished how they handled the character arc of ""Doug"" (Aaron Stanford).P. S. That scene towards the ending; when the Camera tries to focus on Doug (Through the campfire) who's coming back to the RV, with blood all over his body and his face, and with him holding his little girl with one hand and the dog leash with the other; that shot, I thought was a great way to ascertain the badassery he had shown earlier!Doug, my man! I will remember you!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not terrible, fun ride","The movie is thrilling, with great monster moments of terror. I felt uncomfortable, but that was intended. A great re-invention of Wes Cravens 80s flick. Not sure it would be PC in 2021, but still a fun watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Aja sees Craven's 1977 and raises him one HELL of a remake,"Alexandre Aja, you have a new fan.Before this movie was released in theaters, I made sure to watch Wes Craven's original endeavor. Let me just start out by saying that compared to today's standards and conventions, Craven's classic ""The Hills Have Eyes"" seems almost mild when compared to Alexandre Aja's remake. However, purists too skeptic to check this movie out should rest assured that the film is very, VERY faithful to the original. The characters, story, and overall progression of events remain unchanged, however, the quality of all said elements has increased dramatically since the original 70s release. Furthermore, like any other quality remake, there are twists, there are surprises, and for people who think they're getting the same film with updated technology, think again.The film starts out with the nuclear bomb test-radiation disclaimer, and from there, to those who've screened the original, the familiar New Mexico desert setting is presented for all to take in. Make no mistakes, though. Aja never misses a beat, and he makes sure to take advantage of any opportunity he can when it comes to scaring the living crap out of the audience.After a very vivid and graphic opening, the film gets rolling, mixing elements of freshness with both nostalgia and familiarity. People who saw the original will know what they're looking at, however their eyes will also be glued to the screen due to the overall difference in presentation and cinematography. The familiar gas station attendant is shown to the audience, and soon after, the Carter family + in-law stroll in. From there, the real fun begins.Aja and his fellow screenwriter did an amazing job adding depth and dimension to the family members, ensuring that throughout the course of the film, people in the audience would certainly be able to connect with or identify with at least one member of the Carter family. This is accentuated by very strong performances by all the actors. Recognizable, seasoned actors are chosen for the older family members, while younger, relatively lesser known actors are chosen for characters like Bobby and Brenda.I really could not complain with any of the performances. With all the craziness and gruesome things happening to the family, the actors' reactions are all portrayed very realistically, with emotions dead-on with very few hiccups in line delivery. One performance that stood out in particular to me was definitely that of Aaron Stanford (Pyro, X2 and the upcoming X-Men 3). Despite the fact that Standford was merely a year old when the original 'Hills' was released, he more than proves his acting credibility and fits the role of Doug very well. He does the role justice, and fills the shoes of the protagonist very well. I could go on and on about the performances of the rest of the cast (which are all extremely solid), but you want to know more about the movie, right? One cannot help but compare this film to original. There are 3 reasons I feel Aja's remake tops Craven's original: 1) the emphasis Aja places on the Carters, 2) the make-up effects, 3) the excessive gore.Whereas Craven gave the deformed family clan plenty of screen time in 1977, Aja opts to shroud them in mystery for much of the film's duration. In many ways, the family emphasis is almost reversed in either film. Aja makes sure to hide the deformed family members from the viewers until just the proper moment, while Craven made their names and personalities as clear as day. I personally think the less information there is about something, the scarier it becomes to the person dealing with it. Aja realized this, and presented it very well.Speaking of presentation, one cannot help but watch in sheer awe and amazement at some of the deformities displayed by the irradiated family members. I personally have not seen such drastically deformed individuals first hand, and I'm not sure how accurate their portrayals were in 'Hills' '06, but one thing is for sure: they were damn gruesome. Do not be fooled, the little child shown in the commercially televised trailer is NOT representative of the rest of the film.And then there's the gore. Ah, the gore. Monsieur Aja, you are the brainchild of modern horror, and you definitely know how to ride with the best of them. No body part is taboo in this film, and for all you gore fanatics out there, there are no annoying instances where the camera ""looks away"" when someone or something is, say, struck with the menacing swing of a weapon. For all those who've said ""But I wanted to SEE what happened to him!"", rest assured, you will indeed see what happens to everything in this film.The Hills '06 will satisfy your blood-lust. Alexandre Aja takes Craven's original film and builds on it in just about every way. Better acting, better visual effects, better make-up, better story presentation (i.e. no unanswered plot holes or abrupt ""halts""), and much, MUCH more gore. This film is not for the squeamish, and it is my opinion that it will suppress the doubts of any skeptics who, upon seeing this film, may have badmouthed horror movie remakes in the past.Only thing that caused me to dock it a point were the questionable courses of action some of the characters took. Alas, such things may always fall into the category of ""typical horror movie no-no's."" Furthermore, I wasn't really horrified while watching this movie. A more accurate description would be that I was highly impressed and satisfied.Horror movie fans: see this film as soon as you can. Non-horror movie fans: if you see this, prepare to have your world rocked.See this movie people, it's pure gold.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Finally, an excellent horror movie","The Hills Have Eyes, although a remake of the original, was everything a horror movie should be. Typically, I'm not a fan of slasher flicks, but this movie had elements I like to see in a movie. I don't like to see the protagonists making stupid mistakes (the old ""curiosity killed the cat"" syndrome), I don't like being able to guess the villain 20 minutes into the movie (although this wasn't the scenario in this particular movie). I don't enjoy picking out who's going to do die first, and being correct. I don't think sex scenes have any place in horror movies. I like things to be important and advance the plot.Although the movie had some ""MTV"" elements to it, it still adhered to the classic horror movie thrills. The thing I liked about this movie was the fact that they repeatedly ""crossed the line"", doing things that you wouldn't expect modern movies to do, nothing is off limits in this movie. Horrifying elements that made you, well, terrified. Lots of ""boo"" surprises, but also more complex and twisted than modern movies have allowed. I spent most of the movie with my mouth agape... It's not just the gore, although there is a lot of that. They didn't leave anything to the imagination, did not imply anything...they showed you everything.It was admittedly a little slow at first, but then all of the sudden things began to take a turn for the wicked. One thing this movie did that most horror movies don't bother to do is go into character development. Not a lot, but more so than a typical thriller will bother to do.This movie was so disturbing, I'm not sure I'd want to see it again. That ""Deliverance"" mentality...you see it once, you're glad you saw it, but so disgusting you're pretty sure you don't want to experience that again.Any horror aficionado should see this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
S10 Reviews: The Hills Have Eyes (2006),"Plot: A family taking a road trip to celebrate the mother and father's silver anniversary run afoul of another type of nuclear family, one that is cannibalistic and mutated.Alexandre (High Tension) Aja wrote and directed this remake of the 1977 Wes Craven (who is attached as a producer) semi-classic. It sticks pretty much to the source material story-wise. Almost all of the original is replicated here but a few new wrinkles were thrown into the mix mostly having to do with Jupiter's clan and their origins. A little bit of a political slant is thrown in for good measure but it's not awfully heavy-handed and most will glance over it. The remake turns up the style quite a bit over the original no surprise considering the better budget and change in directors. The gore got bumped up significantly and the family looks more disgusting than ever. Now for the big question, how does it stack up to the original?. I say it did pretty well. The original had it's flaws as well as this one but I think they were both done honestly and Aja did an excellent job trying to pay homage to the original and breathe more life into it. The acting is as good as you'd expect with a pretty good cast. Lovers of the original should be OK with it, I am.Both the original and the remake score a 7.5 or 8 on my scale.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Had me running for the hills...in boredom,"A remake of Wes Craven's 1977 version, 'The Hills Have Eyes' left me feeling utterly unimpressed and, while I have not seen the original, if it is anything like this then I wonder why they even bothered . The plot revolves around a family lost in the desert and end up being picked off one-by-one by mutants, and it was basically one huge disappointment with only a few half-hearted scares, instead relying on excessive violence, blood, and gore to gain a reaction from the audience. In fact, the only real chill I got was in the ten minutes of trailers in the beginning when more intriguing flicks such as 'The Omen', 'The Dark' and 'An American Haunting' were advertised.I am no conservative when it comes to violence in horror/action films since most sensible people understand it is just fiction yet nevertheless this film just left a bad taste in my mouth. Rather than using a sharp plot and clever camera work to deliver the chills, this was just a case of 'look how many gory ways we can kill people! Look at how we can splash blood around'. There was even a gratuitous rape scene that left me sickened, rather than terrified, that the scriptwriter could stoop to such depths to try to shock us. And there was even the typical predictable ending to gear us up for a possible sequel (though hopefully no Hollywood studio will sanction that).The result was a flick that is clearly just intended to appeal to lads in their late teens and twenties who still get a kick out of seeing blood and guts flying around. For real horror fans, I'd advise waiting for the more promising horror/chiller flicks to be released through the year. Or, if you are really desperate for the mutants, check out 'The X-Files' episode 'Home', which does the whole concept in a more intelligent, frightening manner.",,Anonymous,Horror

Retired cop takes his family through a desert and finds themselves being stalked by a clan of psychotic murderers.,"I found the Hills Have Eyes to be a decent horror/thriller. Not too suspenseful, yet eerie all the same. I'm not a huge fan of Wes Craven, yet I do enjoy his movies from time to time.The Hills Have Eyes takes the Carter family thru a terrifying experience. A retired old cop takes his family on a trip across the USA. Our story takes place in a desert. After making a wrong turn and being warned to, ""Stay on the mail road, you here."", by a gas/junk store attendant. The Carter family find themselves being followed and stalked by an inbred clan of psychotic murderers. Kidnapped and tortured, the family barely escapes. Or do they?I like this movie.

Excellent Survival Horror Film,"I haven't seen the original, but I now want to because this movie rocked. The movie starts as a slow-boil suspense/horror movie, provides some decent jump-scares (at least in the theater) and spends some time building up character. The movie then switches gears and turns into a gritty, brutal horror movie more the likes of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and further switches to gears to a action/revenge movie, but still with horror elements. It's scary, sick, nearly uncompromising (the unrated cut will undoubtedly be so) and disturbing, but also adrenaline-filled and riveting. Certainly NOT for the weak-stomached person. People were leaving the theater, and the IMDb boards are rife with people damning the movie for it's 'lack of moral substance' and 'taste'. This movie isn't for the average movie-goer. It's for the horror buffs. Alexendre Aja should be proud, and is 2-for-2 in my book having done this and High Tension.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Solid remake,"Alexandre Aja's remake of the Wes Craven classic about a family besieged in the desert by cannibals. This film was a lot better than I thought it would be. While sticking closely to the original's plot, there are a few new twists added to the concept. The monsters aren't really fleshed out, but their past is given more of an explanation. The film is also gorier than the original. Again, this is more of an update tactic. Dan Byrd turns in another fine performance as does Emilie De Ravin. Ted Levine is appropriately gruff as the father. The monsters seem very interchangeable. Its obvious that there are several of them, but they have no personalities like they did in the original. I also don't remember the head of the clan being in a wheelchair with a bulbous head before either. Gone is the brute leader, in is a crippled brain. Some changes work. Some don't. Still, it could have been a lot worse.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Scary and intense! A remake that beats the original!,"We've seen dozens of remakes in the past several years: Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Ring, Dawn of the Dead, The Fog. None could hold a candle next to the original films.Could it be? After all this time, do we finally found a remake that's actually superior? You're damn right! The Hills Have Eyes is not at all like the other remakes in this ungodly trend. It's not a cheap cash-in. It's a movie made with respect by horror filmmakers for horror fans.Sure, it has its share of problems: There are too many cheesy false scares, they added a corny patriotic subtext, and it sticks so close to the original that fans will find little in the way of surprises. But it's a leaner, meaner animal than Wes Craven's original film. The characters are more believable, the mutants are scarier, and the whole thing is incredibly visceral! This is the first studio horror film in years that I've liked...mainly because it doesn't feel like a studio horror film.Funny side note: A girl next to me in the theater was silently weeping through the last half of the movie.

It was alright... But very disturbing...,"I just saw a special preview screening of this film...It was alright in my opinion - not quite what I was expecting though...It will definitely make you jump a lot, and is definitely scary enough - the film is perhaps a bit too disturbing though...The storyline is OK, albeit a bit thin for my liking. The acting was OK but nothing amazing...The feeling of helplessness in this movie is what I really liked about it. It captures that feeling perfectly, in a similar fashion to 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'... In fact, it reminded me a lot of that movie in many ways...The people I went to see this movie with, didn't really enjoy it... however, I thought it wasn't too bad...Anyway - Some of the scenes are pretty horrific to the extreme, so only watch this if you are not easily offended by stuff like that... It has got to be one of the sickest most disturbing movies I have seen for some time... Not to everyone's taste... But if you like that kind of thing...

A worthy remake,"I've been a fan of the original The Hills Have Eyes since I first saw it during a midnight showing while in college. I had my doubts about the remake, but as I enjoyed Aja's High Tension more than I probably should have, I at least felt the film was in good hands. I still enjoy the 1977 version more, but my faith in Aja as an up and coming player in horror was not misplaced.The film is very faithful to the plot Craven used in 1977 - a family traveling cross country finds themselves stranded in the desert and under attack from a mutant family living in the nearby hills. There are a few significant changes (the crater full of abandoned vehicles and the nuclear test city) probably due more than anything to a much larger budget, but these changes actually add even more interest and variety to the script.There's a lot here to enjoy. The acting is great and definitely an improvement over the first film. I especially enjoyed Dan Byrd and Aaron Stanford's performances over the same characters from 1977. The new film is much more graphic than the first film. Aja doesn't skimp when it comes to showing the blood and gore. Aja has done his best to keep the brutality and savagery from the first film in his remake. And, for the most part, he has succeeded. One complaint I've already read on the internet is the movie is too slow. I completely disagree with that statement. I enjoyed the pacing throughout the film. The Hills Have Eyes may start off slow, but it builds to finale full of violence.But there are a few areas where I had problems with the film. One thing that bothered me was the treatment of the mutant family. They never felt like real characters as there was virtually no character development within the mutant family. They are just there. I was also bothered by some technical aspects involving camera work and editing. The movies features what I consider to be way too many shots filmed with a hand-held camera and edited in a rapid, MTV style. Maybe I'm just getting old, but there were several moments during the film where I wanted to scream at Aja, ""Be still and let me see what's going on"". It was too much for me. Also, I thought the exposition was handled rather clumsily. The preaching like exposition given by the immobile mutant felt forced. Finally, and I realize many will disagree, I enjoy the low-budget look of the original. The look helped to give the movie a feeling that anything could happen. In contrast, Aja's film is much more polished looking. I won't go so far as to call it over-produced, but the look of the movie doesn't add as much atmosphere as the lower budget look.In the end, while I did have problems with certain aspects of the film, overall The Hills Have Eyes is a solid horror film. Fans of the original should be able to find something here to enjoy that doesn't trample all over their memories of the first film.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The editing was weird at certain point and the digital effects were also weird, however there are some things I did like. I liked the ""Breakfast Time"" scene. I liked how it fixed the original a bit and did things different (according to what I have seen in some analysis reviews). Everything else is kinda done weird or disturbing. It's not enjoyably disturbing because of the nature of the film, and if it's intentional then I would lower the score because I simply didn't like that, but there was some things that I did enjoy. There's no charm or good execution. The family is passable I guess. This is a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Hills are Alive with the Sounds of ... SLAUGHTER!!,"I dislike the nowadays and boisterous remakes of classic horror movies as much as the next person but, ever since the news came that an update of ""The Hills Have Eyes"" was in talks, I had great expectations towards it. There are reasons for this rather enthusiast anticipation, actually. Unlike ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""The Fog"", to name just two examples, Wes Craven's original 1977 screenplay was open for improvement AND Alexandre Aja would be just the right man for the job, as his own project ""Haute Tension"" is definitely one of the best horror films since the year 2000. That particular film wasn't really a masterpiece of plotting, but it was genuinely grim and barbaric and those are exactly the qualities a film like ""The Hills Have Eyes"" require as well. The new screenplay follows Craven's original fairly strict, except that the eyes in the hills aren't of members of an inbred family anymore but of an entire community of horribly mutated ghouls. Deep in the New Mexican deserts, a small village of coal miners once refused to leave the area at the time the American government decided to test nuclear weapons there, and now they still prowl the wasteland, assaulting travelers that dare to leave the main highways. The Carter family is next on the menu, and the mutants really don't care whether the victims are females, elderly folks or even newborn babies...Alexandre Aja delivers the exact right amount of disturbing tension and really a lot more gore than you could possibly dream of. Much more than the overrated Eli Roth, this young French filmmaker is the new prodigy of horror. Strictly talking in terms of cinema, ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is also a more than decent production. The dialogs are fluently written and the characters are a lot more likable than in the original. By them I primarily refer to the members of the Carter family, as Michael Berryman's charisma as creepy Pluto remains unequaled. Altering the background of the desert-people into mutants was a pretty intelligent move by Aja, though. Despite being sadistic and utterly repulsive-looking bastards, these people are basically a sort of ""victims"" themselves, which brings a lot of extra depth and unsubtle social criticism in the overall simplistic story. I'm sure this film also had its share of flaws, like the editing being a little too MTV-ish perhaps, but the thrills and fast pacing were just too overpowering to have me bother about them. Kudos also to the terrific selection of songs, the convincing cast of actors and actresses and ¬ñ last but not least ¬ñ the personal trainer of those brilliant German Shepard dogs!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Once it gets going it really goes from 0-100 real quick, it's intense and it doesn't let up. The acting is done really well, convincing and most importantly the visual/practical effects are insanely good. Most movie's these days wish they had such good gore.The directing shows its age and era it was made it. The cinematography is bland and boring. There's a lot of shaky-cam for action scenes that felt incredibly disorienting. Simply nothing special.Acting overall was good, It didn't have any characters or actors that felt too out of place or off putting. The family dynamic is a bit cynical but feels real and believable.The score is very forgettable. Sound effects are good.The practical effects and visual effects though. To be clear, there's 95% practical effects and it shows, in a fantastic way. It looks absolutely brutal, this movie does NOT let up. It will not shy away from showing the grunge. This made the kills so much more satisfying. But also that more disturbing for the less fortunate. In addition the character make-up is done really well, aside from some odd CGI moments on irrelevant characters the make up is great. Perhaps a few moments in close ups it felt a bit ''silicone-y'' but those moments were sparse. The also leads into the kills, just really good. Very satisfying.Also.. the camper scene... absolutely disturbing and one of if not the best scene in the entire movie. It's the epitome of horror in lots of ways and it has no shame in showing it.The pacing and story, the story is fine. It doesn't feel incredibly far fetched. But it's simple, as most horror movies are. The pacing, the first half is a bit slow, and it doesn't build that much tension at all. Also the Doug at the crater scene felt a bit long, but did serve a purpose thankfully.Now, a major/minor annoyance from me was the ''teleporting'' of characters and what sometimes felt a bit rushed. It's especially bad towards the end, so I wish that part got a little more time. Also some characters decisions, especially with guns were sometimes frustrating. Especially the veteran detective.Going into this blind was quite the trip though, it's definitely a movie that will subvert your expectations in some ways.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Distasteful,"The entire film from beginning to end was extremely disturbing.I may be naive, but I never imagined that the thought of mutated men raping seemingly innocent women would appeal to the general public. Most of this film consists of Morbid, utterly disgusting, and repulsive behaviour that couldn't be fabricated in your worst nightmares. The extent of gore was truly unbelievable and honestly quite haunting. I wasn't at all prepared for what i was about to view. I have to question the producer when I say ""where do these thoughts come from?"". As far as I am concerned straight from hell. This film is enough to permanently scar you for life. I hope to never view another movie of such distaste.",,Anonymous,Horror
An all time horror film,I'm a simp for this movie. It's not the best horror movie ever but I love semi decent reboots of classics. This movie has some great action and violence while still maintaining a decent story line and acting.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not bad, glad I watched it","To start this review off, I have never seen the original 1970s version but I am however a fan of slasher comedies and this one is nicely unique.Plot:
The story is very slasher familiar, so basically follows common formula for most slasher movies. However it was nicely done and uniquely done by having cannibals living in hills all disformed by radiation. its a very interesting subject. The movie does a good job of introducing scenery, characters, villains and giving a good creepy chill down your spine. Very gory and pretty much a good slasher flick, however only down side is the characters make insanely dumb decisions sometimes which is always painful to watch, mind the pun.Cinematography:
For a slasher movie it ticks all the boxes of having very good shots, gory special affects/ prostectics especially for the time. Cant say much more it's good for the age of the film.Acting:
The performances are again that of a slasher flick. Pretty good but not oscar winning. They did a good job of making us feel concerned and uneasy all the way through the movie.Summary:
I thought this movie was pretty cool and interesting. Definitely a good watch and If you like horror movies, i would highly suggest it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Hills are Alive with the Sound of Mayhem,"Revenge is a dish best served cold. Well, only at night. During the day, it gets kinda hot.Most unbelievable part of this movie was in the opening credits/scenes. The credits show Ted ""Buffalo Bill"" Levine stars...but he doesn't play the leader or even just one of the cannibal mutants. He actually plays the straight man to those abominations.Not to criticize this movie too heavily, as I do love Director Alexandre Aja's work, especially this movie and have few poor words to say about it, but it's pretty forgettable and it REALLY belongs to these excessively gory mid-2000s remakes. In fact, this 2006 remake would be an ideal double-feature with 2003's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and even a triple with this same year's Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning. They are all so very similar.That might sound like a complaint. It really isn't. Well, except for the forgettable part. I only say that because I've seen this before and aside from the main plot, which was lifted from the superior Wes Craven original, I barely remember any of the events. Why it's not a complaint - I like this movie and these brutally violent, Wrong Turn movies of that era. Especially the Texas Chainsaw Massacre Reboot & Prequel.A rather large family does, indeed, take an alternative, unmarked route in the scorching desert and as horror movie has to horror movie, they get stranded. This family WISHES their only troubles were them being lost in the New Mexican wasteland as the title suggests...the Hills Have MANY Eyes. And guns and pitchforks and hungry scavengers...It was rather odd this family, upon learning they may be stuck in the middle of nowhere with little chance of rescue, just sets up camp with their towed trailer. They even drink their water and use tons of electricity all willy-nilly. Even if there weren't hungry, ugly cannibals stalking/killing them, this family isn't too bright.BUT, the second half of the movie is where it's all at. If you love revenge/brutal survival stories, this is one for you. It's RARE to see the good guys (and more than just a final girl) fight back and so nicely. While it was a pretty much shocker to see who dies first, I did like to see the surviving members stand their ground.It isn't perfect, or even that original and it's not too much of a plot, but it's a good show to watch and mercifully, it's not that long. It's been YEARS since I've seen this and even longer since I saw the original. I do recall, this is pretty much beat-by-beat the classic.Recommended. Even if you forget it pretty much a week or so after watching it.I just wish I would've forgotten that sad, 2000s trend of guys wearing their pants just below their buttocks like the kid did in this movie. It was so distracting. I sound like an old man, but for reals, he needed to pull his pants up. Aside from just looking dumb, it can't possibly be a good strategy to try and escape killers running after you while your pants are about a third of the way down.***Final Thoughts: While I don't recall actually seeing this, though I 100% know I have, I DO recall its 2007 follow-up sequel. Well, NOT the movie itself - I actually have forgotten almost 100% of the events of that movie, as well. With good reason. A friend took me out drinking for my birthday and after I probably had too much, we made the weird choice of going to see Part 2. I do NOT think I lasted long before I passed out. Perhaps I need to also revisit that one again just to see what I blacked out to.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horrific.,"Hollywood is hardly lacking in remakes of 70s cult horror flicks, Wes Craven bringing many of them to us through what seems to be a real desire to genuinely frighten a hardened contemporary audience. The Hills Have Eyes brings us more 'lambs to the slaughter' in what may be one of the most gruesome remakes in years.The films plot more or less abides the pre-set rules of it's predecessor; average American family complete with the 'Big Bob' (Levine) father figure and his teenage children are stranded in a desert, seemingly alone. Of course, they aren't alone. After one of the family's beloved pets goes missing, a twisted (and ultimately shallow) plot begins to unravel involving terror, shock and (of course) disgust.Being a shocker film, The Hills Have Eyes relies heavily on what is clearly a good eye for horror direction; which results in scenes of quiet, wait-it-out torture, and others of genuine, intense terror. One scene in particular, which lasts for perhaps ten minutes maximum (yet feels like an hour) is incredibly uncomfortable to watch, and although the characters involved are never properly established (as is a common trait of horror flicks), audiences will find themselves holding their breath, mouths agape throughout. Musically, the film excels in places, as screeching strings conjure images of sharpness and agony, further enhancing the tense nature of the films more horrific scenes.The Hills Have Eyes is, rather than a horror flick, a gruesome shocker. And although it may not really reach it's audience on a deeper level of communication through a meaningful and complex plot, the drama and genuinely horrific scenes portrayed at the films darkest moments certainly make its audience feel something. Even if it is nausea.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bloodthirsty mutant cannibals in the American wasteland,"The question most people ask when it comes to modern day remakes is ""why remake a classic?"", but the question I ask of this one is ""why call it The Hills Have Eyes?"" Many films have been made before and after Wes Craven's original shocker with similar ideas, so why not take the basic plot idea and give it a new title; thus making it a new film. Judged on its own merits, Alexandre Aja's exploitation horror flick is actually a good film, but it loses credibility unnecessarily just because it's a part of the remake crowd. After an explosive beginning which gives you an idea of what Aja intends to do with the remake; the pace relaxes a little as we get to know the doomed family at the centre of the piece. While this may not be very exciting, it pays dividends towards the end when the mutant cannibals start to get their own way. We follow a family who decide to take a holiday that involves driving through the desert. After fuelling their car, the helpful petrol station attendant tells them of a shortcut in the desert; but after they have a crash, it soon becomes apparent that they aren't the only ones amidst the nuclear hills.Towards the start of the film, Aja packs the film with references to nuclear testing which leads us to believe that he wants to go deeper with the plot. However, by the end it all feels very half-arsed, as apart from a few references towards the mentality of America - these ideas never really bear any fruit. Ted Levine heads a capable cast in a role that is a world away from his turn as Buffalo Bill in The Silence of the Lambs, and actually feels a lot like a Sid Haig impression. The rest of the cast have some impressive film and TV credits between them, but nobody is a particularly 'big' actor, which actually does this sort of film credit. The real stars of the show are the make-up department, who do a great job with the mutant cannibals. They all look very realistic, and it's easy to believe that the people in the film actually are mutants. The violence and gore is fairly heavy, although Aja is actually quite restrained in this respect, as it only occurs when needed and never goes too over the top. Aja also does well with the scare factor, as he continually creates a foreboding atmosphere by way of lots of scare tactics, including the backwater desert atmosphere, glimpses of the killers early on and my personal favourite - the voices that come over the walkie talkies.The main reason that this film works is not because of the violence, however, it's the way that Aja almost makes the audience a part of the central family. The characters are all well defined and realistically done; and this means that once we get to the horror of the piece, it really is horrific. Aja does go over the top with this towards the end, but in general the characters are very well defined, and I certainly cared a lot more about the family in this remake than I did in Wes Craven's original. It seems obvious that Alexandre Aja approached this film with care, and he definitely did have a lot to live up to after the surprise hit 'High Tension' the year before. The director certainly has talent, maybe even the potential to become one of the modern masters of horror; but I'm disappointed that this was his second film, as I really think that if he'd created something original, it could have been something really special. The fact that this film feels like an attempt for him to break into the American market is too obvious also. I do have faith that some day he'll top his debut film - but he hasn't done it with this. On its own merits, however, The Hills Have Eyes 2006 is a good film, and Aja can certainly be proud of himself for doing Craven's original justice.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
I mean it's ok...,"To be completely honest, i absolutely hate the original film. I got no enjoyment out of it, not because of its substance, but because it was boring as hell! I disliked it so much to the point where i was hesitant on even checking out the remakes. But i've been told by countless people that this is one of the better remakes from the big early-mid 2000s horror remake boom. Alexandre Aja being behind the camera peaked my interest, mainly because a The Hills Have Eyes premise with the level of gore High Tension had, had a lot of potential. Overall this movie was wishy washy for me. There are parts i really dug. That whole middle chunk is fantastic.You get great gore, shock factor, and memorable moments. The acting performances were great across the board, Dan Byrd especially. That kid can act!! Unfortunately the first and last act are kind of a bore to me. They mostly miss the mark when it comes to what i want from a premise like this. That whole climax in the town was mostly a disappointment for me. Overall even though i'm not on the same level of enjoyment as other people, this was still a watchable and enjoyable movie. There's nothing offensive about it, and it definitely holds great elements. Maybe the hype i kept hearing dampened my expectations. But it is definitely better than the original, no doubt about that.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alexandre Aja will be the next Wes Craven,"A remake it was... yes a remake, and of a classic horror movie too that  was good enough as it was, however... in a world of terrible remakes  and sequels, this was something that was far from terrible.  I would like to say first and foremost, that I was pleased with Aja's  first film ""High Tension"", the man has talent, and he put it to good  use here: A gory, insane, slasher type horror thriller that was the  opposite of cheesy. It really was creepy, and that is extremely hard to  do these days. It had great character structure, you can identify with  and care for the people who are going through this hell. Not many  horror movies do that, it's not even their job, however, it worked for  this film.   now that we know the character structure was believable, The story, oh  yes, the story itself, which we already seen in the original, was a bit  far fetched... but it was interesting and thrilling. In a way,  believable, because there wasn't much of anything in the movie  happening that one would refer to as bull****  like what tends to  happen in most of the rather bad films they make nowadays.   Great fight scenes, well choreographed, great realistic, really  disturbingly graphic looking gore FX, the acting for both the victims  and the killers all done well by these mostly relatively newer, lesser  known actors, who all did great jobs at portraying.   All that I can say about this film, in my humble opinion is: one of the  thrilling, more fun horror films that has came out in the past few  years. Right on par with Texas Chainsaw Massacre, this beats the hell  out of crap like the Ring, The Grudge, Boogeyman, The Fog and other  watered down, pussified horror remakes. If you want scary, than see  this film. But I must warn thee: It is definitely not for the faint of  heart, so leave the littl eones at home.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Needlessly Savage and Not Remotely Scary,"My wife recently planned a night out with her girlfriends, so I had the T.V. to myself and the chance to watch some movies she wouldn't want to see. I had a hankering for some good old fashioned vintage porn and a good scary movie, so I rented this, ""Debbie Does Dallas"" and ""Taboo."" Of the three films I rented, ""The Hills Have Eyes"" was by far the most pornographic, and the last of the bunch I'd want my child (if I had one) to see.It astounds me that the MPAA will give a movie like ""9 Songs"" (which does happen to be a lousy movie) an NC-17 rating, virtually guaranteeing that no mainstream movie theatre will carry it, just because it depicts real sex between real people, and then turn around and give a movie like ""Hills"" an R. What kind of sick world do we live in when the sight of penetration is believed to be more damaging to our youth than the sight of people getting axe picks through their heads and their intestines ripped out? And lest you think I'm just a cranky prude, let me say that I love horror movies, and I'm always on the outlook for good ones (""The Descent"" happened to be fantastic) but I've nearly given up hope that today's batch of filmmakers know the first thing about what scares people. I'm not opposed to gore, and I think it can be used effectively (again, ""The Descent""). My objections to ""The Hills Have Eyes"" rest almost entirely on the fact that it's not effective horror. It's gruesome, to be sure, and it does inspire a sort of visceral reaction from the viewer, but so would a car accident. I've not seen the original Wes Craven version, but the film that this most reminded me of, 1974's ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" gave me close to the same feeling, except that Tobe Hooper's film is unbelievably scary in addition to being nauseating, and it uses true film-making skills to scare the pants off of you, not simply digitally enhanced makeup and sound effects.It depresses me that there's a market for movies like ""The Hills Have Eyes."" I must be getting older, because I'm starting to worry about the state of our country's youth. Doesn't anyone have the attention span anymore to be scared by a clever, psychological thriller, or even a sophisticated slasher film like ""Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""Halloween,"" where your imagination did the work that computers do now? Horror movies used to be fun -- now they're just exhausting. I used to come away from then scared but exhilarated -- now I come away just feeling bad. It's hard to have fun in a movie that shows a woman's baby being held at gunpoint so that a sadistic mutant can suck on her boobs, and then shoot her in the head anyway; or in which a boy comes across the body of his dead mother being disemboweled and eaten.I don't believe that anyone should be stopped from making films like this; I just wish people would have the brains to stop wanting to see them.

"Great movie, but intense","Great movie with an interesting plot however some of the scenes were very intense towards the end. The Hills Have Eyes is a tense horror remake that delivers atmospheric dread and intense moments. The barren landscape enhances the isolation, and the special effects effectively portray the mutants. However, the character development is weak, making it hard to connect with the characters, and the pacing is inconsistent. The violence is also quite graphic, which may not appeal to everyone. While it offers relentless scares for horror fans, it lacks the depth to be a standout film in the genre. 6/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Still rather enjoyable...,"As I sat down here in 2023 to watch the 2006 movie ""The Hills Have Eyes"" again, I believe it was my third or fourth time to watch it. And while I do somewhat remember the storyline in the movie, I opted to return and revisit it once again, as I have been watching some of the ""Wrong Turn"" movies just prior to watching ""The Hills Have Eyes"".Of course I have wwatched the original 1977 movie ""The Hills Have Eyes"", from writer and director Wes Craven, before as well, but I have to admit that I don't recall that movie more than even more vaguely than the 2006 remake. I can't recall how similar or different the two movies are, however.The storyline in ""The Hills Have Eyes"", as rewritten by Alexandre Aja and Gr√©gory Levasseur, is an enjoyable and entertaining one. Sure, one might argue for it being a somewhat generic storyline for a movie of this kind; and that being a movie about cannibalistic mutants living in a desolate location and preying upon any visitors. But it makes for some good old fashioned horror entertainment, nonetheless. And that is what mattered here.The narrative is nicely constructed, as the storyline slowly intensifies in its pacing and thrills. And gradually, the audience are given more and more insight as to what is actually happening in the desolate hills. It was reminiscent of the classic 1980s formula of making horror movies, and it works nicely.The cast ensemble in the movie is good. And I had forgotten that the movie had the likes of Ted Levine and Kathleen Quinlan on the cast list. And it was definitely nice to see that it was the likes of Robert Joy, Billy Dragon and Greg Nicotero that portrayed some of the mutated cannibals. Sure, they were under a ton of prosthetics and make-up, but it was nice nonetheless.Visually then ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is good, because they had the likes of Greg Nicotero working on the special effects. And all horror fans are familiar with the work of Greg Nicotero. And if you aren't, you just got to take certain things of your horror fandom up for revision.""The Hills Have Eyes"" is quite worth taking the 107 minutes to sit down and watch, as it is a good old fashioned type of horror slashing movie.My rating of director Alexandre Aja's 2006 remake ""The Hills Have Eyes"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The hillbilly anthem of the year,"Back in 1977, horror master Wes Craven released upon the film world a low budget horror experience called ""The Hills Have Eyes"" which helped revolutionized the horror genre. After the film's release, Wes Craven's career had become a hit or miss directing crappy films(Scream 3) to highly influential genre pics(A Nightmare on Elm Street). 29 years later, what many consider to be Wes Craven's finest moment in his film career is brought back to life with the 2006 remake called ""The Hills Have Eyes"" of the same name.This movie is brought to you by none other than Alexandre Aja who directed the shockingly gruesome gore fest ""High Tension"" last year. The same as ""High Tension"" Aja is a master when it comes to splatter, gore and truly capturing tension on screen.I have not seen the original ""hills"" so I cannot compare it to this one. While this is not the best horror movie or movie in general in the whole wide world, it is fairly entertaining. The plot might be a little ludicrous but what it lacks in a simple, contrived plot it surely makes up through it's direction and cinematography. Aja is truly a master of this genre and when he starts creating thrills, he doesn't let up.Many people might complain that this film was too heavily edited and has to many quick cuts but I feel that this works to this film's advantage because it truly emphasizes the tension that I think Aja was going for.I recommend anybody to see this movie.

Pretty Useless,"The first problem with this movie is the characters. None are likable. In fact, the script seems to go out of its way to make sure every single character is annoying. You never really care for any. Towards the end you might, but only because the characters stop talking. The movie then depends upon the charisma of the actors, which thankfully they have. Somewhat. Don't expect any characteristics from the mutants, though. Bloodthirsty, nothing else. Hell, they're obviously breeding, but there's only one female capable of it. Plot holes!The second problem with this movie is the heavy-handed politics. They feel contrived, forced, and too blatant. The family is full of ultra-conservatives. Gun loving, God fearing republicans. Except for the one democrat, though. Sure, he's the most annoying of the bunch, very whiny, but suddenly you know where he'll stand. All of this would be fine if the politics were either subtle or crucial to the plot. They're neither. In fact, they almost entirely drop away. It feels like a desperate attempt for depth, but comes across as terribly contrived.The last problem is the action. Very little. The first half of the movie is painful. Nothing happens. All you get is annoying conversation and dumb decisions. The second half picks up, with a couple of good gore effects, but... meh. There's only one interesting action sequence.If you want to go to a movie and turn your brain off and see gore this is maybe a 5 out of 10. Worth seeing, but not good. Unfortunately the director decided to add ""depth"" to the movie, meaning he wants you to think. The movie does not stand up to any form of scrutiny, regardless of your political views. It's just terrible. For the record, though, I thought High Tension was poor as well. Decently directed, but plot holes abound. This is a much worse movie.

Surprisingly good.,"A modern horror film which actually has some good acting, great students, real practical effects, superb makeup. The shocks are there and the landscape looks great as somewhere bleak and isolated. The premise is pretty silly, an atom bomb test creating a race of mutants, when the radiation would probably more likely just give them cancer. It's B movie nonsense. The film uses a fair bit of handheld and there's some really good music to go with the horror stuff. The idea of the film is passing travellers are preyed on by these violent mutants. Of course there's no phone signal either for our characters to call for help. There's a nice bit of writing about how our main character the father is somewhat less than the full macho man his father in law is, running his own security business and being very much the captain of the operation. There's also some slightly suggested subtext about some flirting going on between two other characters who shouldn't be doing it. Both the young characters in the film are really quite good and the story of a boy who has to become a man is of course quite universal. The film is quite gory and in the 2000s a lot of horror films became more interested in that than almost anything else. The mutants though are quite smart in this film and able to lay traps and ambushes. You do wonder though where they get their electricity from? The story is almost a bit of a western too at times with the climax showdown taking place in the seemingly deserted little dusty town.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"An OK remake, although much brutal than the original!!","The Hills Have Eyes is a horror film and remake of Wes Craven's 1977 film of the same name. The film was directed by Alexandre Aja and stars Aaron Stanford, Kathleen Quinlan, Vinessa Shaw, Emilie de Ravin, Dan Byrd and Ted Levine.The film based on the a family who is been travelling to California and is been attacked by cannibals.A Disturbing, violent and an intense film. The film which is a remake of a classic might doesn't match the standards but still the film doesn't disappoints. There could be a debate on the type of cruelty shown on animals of human but with the genre of film this violence is expected and criticism based on this is not justified.Plot is ok and screenplay is also ok, the screenplay could've been more crisped and tight and the length of the film could've been little trimmed although the screenplay will not disappoint you.Acting is average to above average as there was nothing much to showcase in terms of acting due to the genre of the film.

Can't decide whether to be offended or impressed,"I review this movie without having seen the original. Maybe that's just as good, since the review will then be based on the merits of this movie alone and not on how it holds to the original. What is this movie all about ? To me it's about shock value, horror, torture, freaks, sadism, survival, humiliation, revenge and a lot of gore. Some people will probably find the gore and horror in this movie hilarious and look at it with humor, while other people will be offended. Personally I'm leaning more towards the latter. I love horror movies, but I was never a fan of movies like Hostel and Saw, where horrific killings and torture seems to be used solely for shock value - as cheap entertainment. This movie will probably appeal to the audience of those movies. But in my view it is a superior movie. It's not Deliverance, which explored the theme of survival against sadism on a different and more serious level (I would label that movie more of a drama than a horror movie). Hills is definitely a horror movie and pure entertainment. But as such it's actually very well made ! The directing, acting, locations, effects, musical score...it is all quality stuff and makes this movie something more than just a cheap bucket of blood and fake limbs being poured all over the audience. I find this movie quite artistic and atmospheric at times. The cinematography is nice. It's not a cheap attempt on cashing in on gore hungry viewers..it's quite a classy attempt on cashing in on gore hungry viewers:) And I guess it must be a worthy remake of the original. What it all comes down to is - do you like these kind of movies or not. If you do, I guess I can recommend this movie. But it's definitely not for the faint of heart. Personally, I was balancing on the edge all through the movie, not being able to decide if I should be impressed by the quality of the filmmaking, or if I should be offended on what was portrayed on the screen. What really made this movie hard for me to watch was the scene involving rape and murder of innocent women, and the fact that there was a baby involved. But in terms of filmmaking it's definitely a good movie. So I guess I will give it a 6. I'm sure people who are not offended, will easily be able to give it a higher rating.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Highly recommended for strictly hardcore horror, blood, gore fans",Firstly I would like to agree with the first reviewer. If it is graphic violence and gore you want then this will be the equivalent to a Wet Dream for you. The make up artists should have had an Oscar nomination for the mutants. When Ruby takes the baby to protect her and the baby's father searches the house and the deformed kids ask him to play was one of the highlights for me.If it's violence you want then you cannot go past this. I was totally gob smacked by its impact and if you are a horror freak and this does not satisfy then you are hard to satisfy.

Intense Horror film,"Just returned home from the theatre after watching ""The Hills have eyes"".I have heard of Wes Craven's original but never had the chance to see it. Therefore I cannot tell you if it is better than the original, equal, or worse. What I can assure you is that is an highly intense movie. You get very attached to the characters, you feel like you are in their shoes. Frustrated and lost when the car breaks down in the desert, scared and helpless when they are attacked by the mutants, angry and revengeful when they attack the mutants. If you also consider that the plot of the movie is nothing special (a family lost in the desert is attacked by mutants), the director succeeds in keeping us at the end of our seats during the whole time.Whether you are a horror fan or not you should watch it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Finally a contemporary American horror with a little bit of guts!,"Alexandre Aja has constructed a wonderful horror remake of Wes Cravens' The Hills Have Eyes, but before I get to the ins and outs of my comment I think it's important to note that the horror genre should split opinions and on reading some of the other comments this film it clearly does. Yes it does contain scenes that some viewers would find 'gory', 'stomach churning', 'horrific', 'sick', 'twisted' and even 'demented', but these are all terms that I believe should be associated with a good horror film. Secondly it is one of the few contemporary American horror films that dare to embrace a scene of sexual violence and consider it integral to the plot. This is due to it occurring during the audiences' introduction to the nuclear fall-out victims and is purely there to help assist the audience in establishing these characters as extremely menacing and repulsive and every time these characters are seen on screen this is how the audience will feel - repulsed. Having seen the film several times now I can say that it is encouraging to see a film that is attempting to push the boundaries that little bit more on what can be accepted in modern Hollywood cinema (even if it is in the form of mutated killers in the New Mexico desert).The suffering encountered by the family throughout the film will be seen by some viewers as gruesome ¬ñ but then again it is a horror! The film does suffer from horror clich√©s and it does pose you with many burning questions whilst you are watching (including ""Why shoot?"" Why investigate the strange noise?"" ""Don't go in there"" etc) and these thoughts will take the edge away for many viewers.The Hills Have Eyes does have a strong Texas Chainsaw Massacre feel to it as there are many similarities that can quite easily be drawn. Another film that's heavily referenced is Straw Dogs, mainly through the Character of Doug to Dustin Hoffman, as audiences will quite easily buy into his perceived outlook on life not to mention his laid-back appearance.Another downfall in the film lies with the decision for it to have a strong political stance. It is littered with examples, predominantly encapsulated with the over use of the American flag. There are many political connotations including the reference of guns being a tool for Republicans (and the guns ultimate failure in achieving any service for the family ¬ñ in fact it's negative), the use of the Hendrix's 'Star Spangled Banner' riff when Doug reaches down to collect his glasses after a bloody battle with a nuclear fall-out victim (a rendition that is often associated with anti-war and anti-American notions), the use of the dog as his sidekick can arguably be seen as an association with the Democrats (Blue Dog Democrats, Yellow Dog etc) and of course the role of the girl in the bright red coat.Finally the film is a very good remake and yes, in my opinion, it is better and it will divide movie goers but what it won't do is divide the level of appreciation that will gained by many horror fans from this welcomed, well-made and well delivered re-instalment to the genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Decent remake, okay film.","Nobody really expected any higher of this depressing remake to Wes Craven's 1977 horror film. Although it does follow the first quite well, the film itself could have been less depressing, and more frightening. Its set on what kind of horror your into. The psychological type, or the gory type. For this, its a little of both. But a lot of key things in this are taken away for its own pleasure. But it still holds out.The story is about an American family who become stranded in the middle of the New Mexico desert, where they become the prey of cannibalistic mutated humans living in the hills.Similar characters, similar dialogue, and similar events to the original, this one brings a different approach that the other one did. Brought up the gore, and simplified the dialogue. Goes a little overboard with the blood and violence, and the scenes go on to the very end until your ready to call it quits. But if you stay throughout the whole film, its not that hard.A few fatalities are entertaining. But the scenes for this film become not much, and don't seem that long. The first half is them becoming stranded, and getting attacked by the mutants. The second half, all the way to the end is hunting down the mutants. It just turns into a slaughterhouse.Not that this takes away from the film, but these guys are pussies. A guy with a gun runs away from one of the mutants chasing him. Try shooting him! It would be so awesome to bring the Dawn of the Dead guys in there, and take care of all of them easily. Its like, stand aside and make way for these guys. They would all gun them down in no time.Like I said before, it as a remake is good. As for it as an actual film, its not that bad, but its not that good. It has its flaws, but overall its watchable. If you have seen the first and are curious, give it a viewing. If you haven't, then still go ahead. Its not like you absolutely have to watch the original first. Just avoid the sequels. They suck!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very Violent and Gore,"While traveling in a trailer to California through the New Mexico Desert, a family is misled to a shortcut going to nowhere by the owner of an isolated gas station and wrecks the car in a rock. Along the night and on the next day, they are attacked by a group of deformed cannibals, fruit of the atmospheric nuclear tests conducted by USA from 1945 to 1962 in that spot. Absolutely trapped by the psychotic mutants, they have to fight to survive.""The Hills Have Eyes"" is one of the most visually violent and gore movies that I have recently seen. I have never had the chance to see the original 1977 Wes Craven's version, but this disturbing and sick remake certainly is not recommended for sensitive persons. Is spite of the having a storyline very similar to ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Wrong Turn"", ""Wolf Creek"" and even ""House of Wax"", i.e., a group of innocent people is under siege of psychopaths, most of them dies and in the end few of them survives, I liked this film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Viagem Maldita"" (""Damned Trip"")",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
a surprisingly good film.,"Usually when it comes to remakes I tend to stay away from them, but I actually enjoyed this movie quite a lot when I watched it in March of 2019. Although I love the original Hills Have Eyes, I'm definitely gonna have to admit that I liked this one more than the 1977 version, no offense to Wes Craven of course. I thought the backstory they gave to the mutants on why they're like that in the remake was interesting. Kudos to Aja because this movie is definitely enjoyable to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
An impressive remake that I preferred to the original!,"The Hills Have Eyes (2006) is a remake of the 1977 original and follows a family who get stranded on a government atomic wasteland, which they find is home to a murderous mutant family. I definitely prefer this to the original. It was a really good and terrifying film! I loved it!Firstly, The characters were very likable and the acting was great too, the performances got gradually better as the film progressed. I specifically liked Doug, he was an absolute sweetheart. My main criticism for the original is that I didn't care for the characters, but I was really rooting for them in this one.This movie had good visual effects and was very brutal, it was a hell of a lot more disturbing than the original! The gore was very impressive and looked very realistic, which made it hard to watch at some points.The film included a classic 2000s horror score which added to the experience of watching. Also the sound design was effective and really stood out in certain scenes.The cinematography was great; the film was full of bleak colour palettes and very well it scenes. Alongside this, there were also some cool editing techniques and good cuts between shots.The film started with a gripping intro, and some super creepy opening credits. It immediately had an ominous and eerie atmosphere, and throughout the film the tension just gets higher. I was hooked almost straight away! It really was a sad tale that made me deeply upset for the characters. The ending was great, and although the final shot was cheesy, I still liked it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Shockingly Savage Remake,"The Hills Have Eyes 2006 remake is terrific piece of terrifying terror.The 70's wes craven original CLASSIC is obviously excellent but the remake makes everything abit better, scarier & a sense of more gritty realism, it's terrifying.I'm not knocking the original 70's Classic as I'm a huge fan & think it's a Horror classic too, it's just the remake ups everything including the tense dread filled atmosphere & the savage mutant attacks, it's a blood soaked masterpiece of a remake & is genuinely terrifying, both films make for an excellent double bill.The atmosphere is so on the edge & full of dread, it's actually scary as hell without any silly comic moments, it's all kept tight,serious & tense.The cast is superb, that goes for everyone in this movie!!!The desert setting is terrifying & lonely, the mutants are absolutely terrifying & extremely savage.This is a brutal,raw survival Horror with intensely filmed action scenes & fight scenes that are horrifying.The whole mutant town scene is truly terrifying!!!This is as raw & savage as these survival slashers can get along with the also outstanding Texas chainsaw massacre remake (2003) & the extremely underrated Horror Gem ""Borderland 2007""This is a bloody slaughter house of a movie with scary cannibal mutants slicing up anyone they can get & ordinary people rising to be heroic.A brilliant Horror masterpiece with intense performances & shocking gore.Aaron Stanford gives the most powerful, intense & ferocious performance in the movie as ""Doug"" a timid geek type of guy until his wife is murdered & his baby is taken, then he become a savage vigilante warrior who brutally fights back against the mutant hillbillies & it's fantastic to watch!!! It's one of the greatest performances in the Horror genre & his character ""Doug"" is easily one of the greatest in the Horror genre!!!Doug becomes as tough as Evil Dead's ""Ash"" as he goes through hell to get his baby back & as heroic as ""Mad Max"" by the end of the movie!!!It's a standout stunningly raw performance.Aaron Stanford is so great to watch fighting these monsters to save his baby, pure Horror & one of the greatest Horror movie hero performances of all time,
Just watch the tense as hell fight scene between him & Pluto, it's a terrifying & raw savage fight for your life sequence, one of the best fights in cinema history.The Hills Have Eyes is truly a modern horror great but it's Sequel is even better.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Worst Ever?,"I do like horror and gore has never been a problem (Carpenter's ""The Thing"" is among my favorite films) but I also come into a theater expecting to be entertained. ""The Hills Have Eyes"" provide NO entertainment of any sort. It's a movie that apparently, and firmly at that, believes that showing gratuitous violence and scenes straight out of the lowest snuff movie you can find (being burned at the stake anyone?)is somehow going to make it worth our while. In reality it just makes the filmmakers(?)look desperate for not having anything solid in which to cling this lame remake. I don't go into this sort of films expecting very literate plots but I do go under the assumption it at least will have one, not a car-breaks-down-mutants-attack doodle as a screenplay, I don't expect to encounter something written by chimps and that's what this one seems to be.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Hills have Noses,"The hills Have Eyes. Have you seen this? It is horrendously garbled tat. The version I saw was the re-make and it made me start to wonder why it was ever made in the first place. A weak and flimsy plot scattered with Hollywood style philosophical lines that are guaranteed to have you squirming with hatred for everything that is American. lines such as; The lucky ones die first. My immediate thought was that the lucky ones never get to watch this trite pap. I did actually consider myself to be lucky. right up until the point when I had sat through this unholy epic, now I think I am probably more unlucky than the people who actually survived this ordeal. The premise is weak; A suburban American family is being stalked by a group of psychotic people who live in the desert, far away from civilisation, and that's it. Each member of the family is killed off one by one in hideous and unimaginative ways by these psychotic hill-billies. I think it is fair to say that there are a couple of humorous parts in the film, but I really don't think that Alexandre Aja, the director of this modern masterpiece actually intended them to be funny. The film is supposed to be hard hitting and scary. I found it puerile and boring.",,Anonymous,Horror
A creepy and effective horror remake,"A family traveling through the Nevada desert are sent on a short-cut that puts them into the path of a deadly group of killer mutants, who have been preying on innocent travelers for years.The Hills Have Eyes is a scary and effective horror film that actually takes the time to develop everything instead of just rushing into the violence. For this type of film, there are really only two formulas that are commonly used today. The director could either develop the characters and story so the audience becomes familiar with them or the director can just do a quick introduction and just rush into all the murders. The Hills Have Eyes is an example of the former and it does a good job at it. The pacing is not too slow at the beginning and we get to know everyone as well as get a good look at the location. Then like a torpedo, the film just takes off and it manages to be memorable without being gory or over the top.Alexandre Aja did a good job behind the camera. He really set up a creepy atmosphere for the film and he used that desert location perfectly. He managed to create plenty of tension with horrifying villains and quick editing shots. He also produced a few inventive death scenes that didn't depend heavily on gore to be scary. He sometimes dragged a situation out for too long but as a whole, the movie was usually interesting and entertaining to watch. The villains looked pretty good as well especially compared to other similar films like 'Wrong Turn'. I would say that the dialog was largely bland yet the characters were still interesting because they were more ordinary and therefore relatable.Compared to the genre, the acting was better than the standard. Emile De Ravin gave a good performance. She could have played a shallow, spoiled brat but she had a little more depth to her. Vinessa Shaw was a bit of a miscast because she didn't strike me as mom to the baby, maybe more of an older sister. Dan Byrd was surprisingly good and I say surprisingly because I was expecting his performance to be really annoying but it was quite tolerable. Aaron Stanford was unlikable at first but quickly improved as the movie progressed. Kathleen Quinlan and Ted Levin gave adequate performances as the parents. Also, the actors portraying the bad guys did a pretty good job. Overall, The Hills Have Eyes covers some familiar territory but it still manages to be quite exciting thanks to the interesting direction and talented cast. Rating 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Wrong turn"" indeed, Greg Nicotero's effects are delightfully gruesome","*** Aaron Stanford, Dan Byrd, Emilie De Ravin, Kathleen Quinlan, Robert Joy, Ted Levine. Directed by Alejandre AjaLets face it remakes are all the rage and we've already seen a bomber with ""When a Stranger Calls"" kudos to Simon West. But Aja's ""Eyes"" is one of the best remakes (of a horror movie to boot) I've seen in a long time. He adds himself new parts that honestly made me jump, I haven't seen a horror movie that made me jump in a very long time, it's was delightful.The story of a family traveling through the remote desert to get to San Deigo which are soon sent into hell. When their car crashes and breaks down in the middle of nowhere (sure it's been done before but remains interesting) the family is stuck and left to wait. A band of radioactive mutants (! attacks the family and leaving them traumatized. The trailer seen is one of the most horrific scenes in the movie, especially for the 1977 Wes Craven version.My personal favorite was he mutated effects done by genius artist Greg Nicotero, Tom Savini himself couldn't have done a better job. Again Nicotero working with Robert Joy who was in last years ""Land of the Dead"". And the duo go hand in hand, Joy delivers the acting while Nicotero helps make it more terrifying.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"One ""Hill"" of a Film!","There's one word to describe this horror masterpiece: riveting. I never gave Alexandra Aja the serious chance as a filmmaker to impress me. I viewed his previous film, ""High Tension"", and was entertained, yet not so much to the point where I was having a blast. Then ""The Hills Have Eyes"" trailers started to pop up and I checked out who was the director. I almost moaned when I saw Aja's name, but decided I'd give it a chance, seeing as I was already a fan of the original ""Hills"". I paid, I sat down in the theater, and...wow. I'll never doubt Alexandra Aja as a filmmaker again! This is truly a horror-drama, when carefully looked at from all the elements. You have the familiar story of the slightly dysfunctional family who become trapped in the least-liked place in the world. How do you scare us? Throw in mutant cannibals! Truly original and highly unexpected. The directing was phenomenal compared to the other crap we receive from horror films *cough**cough* ""Silent Hill"". The acting is truly believable. I was even stunned to find that veteran actors such as Ted Levine were totally committed to this project. Also, the make-up...friggin' creepy and it works! I completely forgot that they were actors and really believed they were these mutated freaks! I mean, I was chanting throughout the film, ""Please kill that guy"", ""Please kill that big woman"". The suspense is well built and even made me jump, 'cause I'm one of those people whose hard to scare at horror films. Alexandra Aja has directed a beautiful, gory, suspenseful masterpiece and will surly go down in cinematic (and horror) history as, not only a great remake, but an excellent horror film as well.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gore galore and nothing more,"Wes Craven's 1977 flick ""The Hills Have Eyes"" has just been remade by Alexandre Aja and would certainly please the targeted audience. If you're looking for hardcore gore, this may work as the film is basically two hours of sadomasochistic viewing pleasure (minus thirty minutes for the character exposition). Else...Set in an abandoned area of New Mexico, a family on their way to San Diego gets stranded among the hills of the desert. With no contact to the rest of the world, they try to survive the dangers that lurk around them, including psychotic mutated cannibals. Uhm, basically that's all.Movies of this type don't really rely on plot and characters, so it's natural for the main characters to be stereotypes of various degrees - although to be fair, the script does generate genuine sympathy for the family. The cast also gives a decent performance, with Emilie de Ravine of ""Lost"" prominently popping first into my mind. (I wonder why.) Aja, who also directed the French horror film ""High Tension"", amps up the gore level here, drifting over the story at a faster pace, obviously to suit the attention span of its expected viewers. And of course, logic begins to lose its grip and falls off completely behind. Thereon, heads are pierced with picks, fingers are severed, body parts are eaten, and so on.Sure, ultimately we'll all view it subjectively and there are those who will drool over this kind of stuff. Personally, I find ""The Hills Have Eyes"" not total crap, with building tension and occasional scares at some point. Still, in the end it's nothing fresh either, without breaking any new grounds and nothing much to offer to anyone else. From the slashing and skewering opening scenes down to the twist, the film becomes not just a remake, it also becomes an index of clich√©s of the genre it treads on.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

great horror fun!,"some people here have said 'even better than the original' etc... from what i've heard, that isn't saying much!!however i still found this movie to be highly entertaining, and it satisfied what i was looking for... i.e a good gore fest to enjoy with the missusthe first half of the film is quite gripping because you don't actually see the horror, however after seeing two of the deformed villains in a fairly farcical caravan sequence the movie then develops on nicely to a good old fashioned tasteless horror rompAaron Stanford, who you'll recognise from the x-men, puts in a good show as a nerdy liberal telecommunications salesman. by the end of the movie he looks in very poor shape indeed, but still manages to muster some good old fashioned American spunk to help him pulp the mutated flag waving red necks!some of the other characters are quite annoying though, and the movie tries hard (but fails) to be as disturbing as 'wolf creek' (some scenes are completely and shamelessly stolen from that movie)however on the whole this is great mindless fun. go in with low expectations as i did, and you might just be in for an unpleasant surprise..",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Mess,"Yes, I am a fan of the original and at the time Craven made the 1977 version, he had little to no budget and yet the film is brutal and scary and disturbing. So now, decades later, with quite a lot of money, French director Aja is given the reins. The film has one flaw that a horror movie shouldn't have - it is rather boring. Now I like films to take their time - I'm a huge fan of Asian horror and they can be so effective at drawing things out so that dread is pushing down on your shoulders. But there were soooo many long scenes between the stranded family where nothing was happening and yes, at the end, when the ""gloves come off"" and it's REVENGE time - the movie picks up speed and lots of violence and gore and so what? The mutants in the movie are so outlandish that any reality factor goes out the window, they are basically fighting comic book monsters. While being stalked by REAL humans, by real depraved psychos is much more terrifying than subhuman monsters out of Tales From The Crypt comic book. The actors deliver and I do feel that Aja has talent as a director. But overall the whole thing felt like a big empty excuse to use a ""brand name"" in horror and show off the latest gore effects.

Actually quite good ‚Äì by remakes' standards,"Yes, 'The Hills Have Eyes' is a good film. Doesn't that mean it's a classic? No, it's a remake. And, seeing as ‚Äì seemingly ‚Äì every film needs to remade/re-imagined or have Spock home back in time to create an alternate timeline, most of them fall nowhere near 'okay.' Therefore, remakes need to be judged through more lenient eyes, so it may not be a good film, but it's a damn fine remake! The plot from the 1977 original remains the same ‚Äì a nice, happy family gets stranded in the middle of an American desert and is slowly picked off by the local mutants who generally want them dead for varying reasons. Nice and simple. The family must therefore fight to survive.And that's all there is to it. With a plot so simple, it could be great or it could fail. Luckily, the cast of actors save it. They work pretty well together and generally annoy each other (as most real families do). They bicker, they moan and get at each other, but ultimately come together to overcome a greater threat. Plus, most importantly, they don't make too many ridiculous judgements meaning they're the architects of their own demises. There's nothing worse than yelling at the TV screen to the protagonist because they're making ridiculous calls which simply further the plot. Here, the family do basically what we'd do in such a grisly situation.And it is grisly. First of all there is gore (and strong violence) aplenty. Not only are the kills pretty extreme, but the make-up on the mutated locals is suitably gruesome. 'The Hills Have Eyes' certainly isn't for everyone. Its strong gore and adult content will certainly put some people off. It's not for the squeamish, but if you like your horror films brutal and violent then this one is for you.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Goes flat when it's not being brutal,"Alexandre Aja's ""The Hills Have Eyes"" goes flat when it's not being brutal. It has explosions of violence instead of suspense. The desert dwellers who attack the Carter family look like they stepped out of ""Wrong Turn; they're too cartoonish to be truly threatening like the previous tribe, which included the immortal Michael Berryman and James Whitworth as Papa Jupiter. Photographically, the film is slick, and Aja does some good work layering in old photographs of deformed babies and older children suffering gross deformities. If you know the plot of the original, there are no surprises here. Despite its limited budget, the original maintained an atmosphere of dread and doom, and the family felt real. This remake family, unfortunately, feels like a movie family, and I didn't buy them as a unit with a history together. The violence, thankfully, is impactful, and there are shotgun blasts to the head, axes buried in skulls, a slimy mutant incapable of movement, big shotgun deaths, a ghost town that looks like it just got built, a crater of abandoned vehicles, a fantastic little girl mutant with uneven eye sockets, a rape, a burning, and a fast climax. Still, between the good bits, the narrative grinds to a halt because the characters, as newly re-imagined, aren't any more human than the owners of the eyes in the hills.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Great Action-Horror Movie (and One of the Best Horror Remakes),"This is a review of the unrated version of the movie (the one not shown in theaters). According to sources, the unrated version has around 60 +/- seconds of addition footage (mostly violent content). Thought I'd share that tidbit in case anyone was curious!While many might have stopped reading by now because of the amount of high violent content, I have to admit I was entertained throughout the vast majority of the movie. It all sort of stems from how well you can sympathize with those being tormented. I personally found the family dynamics totally worked, siblings acted bittersweet to one another, the father was dead on (arrogant and the man with a plan), and together they felt real. Even if at times some of them were unlikable they still felt like the typical squad. Put them in a very tense situation by Mr. Aja and you have a fast-paced mutant thriller.This is an action-horror movie plan and simple. Characters fight against the mutants multiple times, they make traps, traps go off, chases ensue, one-on-one fight scenes, and many more aspects that make this an action type movie. There is little suspense to mention outside of first few scenes were the mutants move unnoticed. That being said, it was a pretty enjoyable film (as long as you can handle the violence) because of how fast paced the movie is. And by fast paced I mean once the carnage starts and the mutants make their presences known, the movie doesn't let up till the final image. This is a movie that creates its scares by visuals, from the grotesque looking mutants to the over the top gore displayed on the screen. So for me, the movie wasn't scary at all.So are you going to find this movie on a list of best horror movies of the past XX-amount years? Probably not, mostly because the movie substitutes suspense for gnarly imagery and in your face violence (which a lot of people aren't down with). That's not to say the movie is bad, but Aja (director) knows what he was going for with this one and who his target audience is (gore hounds). The Hills Have Eyes was created for those people who want visual stimuli and unrelenting violence, and the movie succeeds as such.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Shockingly good movie,"The plot of the movie was very interesting, but I had low expectations on that movie. Eventually, it was unexpectedly good. The storyline was well-written, but there weren't any ""huge"" plot twists. The characters weren't very interesting, but it's okay. The kills were so disgusting, gory and graphical. There were many scary and intense scenes. The ending scene was expected. In my opinion, it's for sure one of the most disgusting movies I have ever seen. Also, I have to admit that I was angry of the decisions some characters were making. Anyway, the remake is for sure way better than the original.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Remakes do work you know.,"Ah, the homely, squabbling Carter family. Traveling through the Nevada desert on the way to San Diego. When suddenly their trailer is beset with punctures and promptly crashes off the road. Was this an accident? Or is there here, in a place where atomic testing was done years before, really eyes in them thar hills?So here it be, yet another horror remake of an older much loved picture from the age of the X certificate. Taking on the task, and wrath of fans, for The Hills Have Eyes is Alexandra Aja. Aja, boasting good horror credentials after directing 2003s Haute Tension (Switchblade Romance), actually pulls it off rather well. Sure it at times feels like he's confused as to if it wants to be ""horror porn"" or a ""boo jump scary movie"" but by and large it's a dirty damn grimy chiller.Once Aja submitted his cut to the US censors for classification, word quickly spread that it was so grotty and sick it got the death knell NC-17. Rumours were rife that the film was so disgusting, people were walking out of test screenings feeling ill. There is no such thing as bad publicity, but in this case it became a bad case of unachievable expectations, the desensitised MTV crowd just wasn't enamoured with it. This was after all a hip horror director in waiting, aided on production duties by Wes Craven himself {director of the original}, throw in the shrewdly out there press reports, well it should have been the second coming of the anti-Christ in many eyes.Yet now it's finally getting support in the right circles, and that's rightly so. For Aja builds his film up nicely with an extended introduction to our characters, whom we know are soon to be desperately violated. The atmosphere, thru gliding camera work and plinking score, is heavy, pervading doom is the order of the day, and then Aja unleashes his hellish barely human monstrosities {led by a fabulously vile Robert Joy}. Blood flies and screams are abound as Aja gleefully starts to up the anti for screen horror violence.Very much following the marker set by Craven's original, is actually what stops this from truly breaking the mould. It lacks freshness to go with it's willingness to set bloody parameters. But, and it's a good but, this is still one fine and squeamish little ride, one that lingers like a naughty thought for days in the memory. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Hills Have Eyes,"My husband wanted to see this movie and I enjoy scary movies as well, so we checked the movie listings and of course the reviews. I was impressed by the fact that the director was Wes Craven, as I enjoyed The Nightmare on Elm Street movies, so together we decided we would go. I have no idea how this movie rated a 6.5 out of 10! What a waste of time and money. One couple sitting near us even left about 25 minutes into the show. Unfortunately we stayed for the entire show. My husband actually leaned over about half way through the movie and apologizes for his movie selection. He thought it was particularly funny that when the movie finally ended someone in the audience actually yelled ""Boooooo"" The acting was so cheesy. If this saves even one couple from going to this show it is worth it to me. Seriously, choose something else. There was one good thing about this movie.....the popcorn was GREAT!!!!",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

When Hollywood Goes too far,"This movie is a graphic and visually sickening display of a Hollywood film that crosses a boundary and goes where there is no artistic merit or any redeeming value to the film other than to appeal to the sickest minds who are interested and want to see something that is the ideal dream of a psychopath. It goes to the very bottom of a soulless human being with no creativity and who has nothing to contribute to film-making and instead dishes up one heeping, smelling pile of refuse. This is something that is so sick and twisted I think theatre owners need to take a stand up to this kind of utter assault on Americans. It is a form of visual terrorism.

Not bad done...,"first of all I want to tell you I am not really a horror fan, but this movie scared me sometimes in a good way. Good acting and filming. The negative thing about this film is that it's again the tourists who are killed and that's the same in so many other movies. But if you want to have nice exciting night, this movie will help you with that. But you need to be used to a lot of ketchup (read blood) because that's one thing you see a lot. The creatures are very scary I must confess. They don't die quickly like in every horror movie, but this film keep in touch with the realistic world. So it doesn't look stupid as many other horrors. Bottom line this is a pretty good movie, with a good story and a lot of blood.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very suspensing and gruesome movie!,"I saw the unrated version of this movie, and I now wonder what the rated version could possibly be like. This film had many twists to the road it was taking by killing off some characters you wouldn't expect, which is what you need in horror films to build suspense and curiosity. Some of the scenes were filled with great tension, some with so much, I kept shouting at the screen because I couldn't believe what I was seeing. The acting was great from most of the characters except a few. The deformed people are horrific and creepy, but what's even creepier is what they do and how they act. Bottom line, this movie delivers a big gory horror piece that nearly becomes excellent.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Worthy remake of a classic,"OK this is a remake, of which we get a lot of here lately.Most remakes I hate, a few I like.I like this remake.This isn't as good as the ""TCM"" or the ""DOTD"" remakes we got recently but it is good.It holds your attention and is tense and gory ,as we would expect.An all-American family ends up lost and stranded in the New Mexico desert and falls victim to a group of mutants descended from some folks who decided to hide out and remain in the desert rather than heed the government's warning and leave during the nuclear testing of the 1950's.So we get some mutants who are nasty mean and suffer all sorts of hideous birth defects.Pretty cool.The struggle of the all-American family to survive the repeated attacks of these mutants makes for a pretty good movie.Well at least as good as the restrictions of the rating system will allow it to be.I always want more gore and guts and boobies than an ""R"" will allow but ,alas,we must take what we can get.Cool special effects and a good cast and tight direction make this horror film worthy to see.While not a great horror movie,it is a cut above most of the schlock we see here lately with the label ""horror"".",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alexandre Aja is the new horror king!!,"I got to tell you I remember seeing the original in a drive-in with my sister when I was 8 years old. Its scared the crap out of me, having seen my share of horror movies since then I look at the original as lame. So when I heard they were doing a remake I thought they couldn't make it any worse. Not in my wildest gory wet dreams could I have imagined that they would surpass the original, hell this is probably the best remake these jaded eyes have seen since the Texas Chainsaw remake. I was blown away!! Yes, there are some slow parts but its called creating tension. Aja and his parter Levasseur re-wrote Craven's mediocre (sorry Wes but after Red Eye I lost all respect I have for you) and created something truly dread inducing, and disturbing at the same time. Big props to KNB effects, the mutant makeup is Oscar worthy and the gore...ah yes the glorious gore. How Aja gets a R-rating I don't know but he is truly the new master of horror. Carpenter and Craven can safely retire the genre is is great hands.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Just another mediocre remake of a unique horror movie.,"The original The Hills Have Eyes was an OK horror film, if not a bit slow and a bit rough around the edges. The remake lacks the raw realism of the 1980 version and it borrows too heavily from other recent remakes (including their flaws). It has Texas Chainsaw Massacre all over it and the mutant village reminded me of the House of Wax. Don't you think these remakes are following a formula? 20 minutes of bonding (pop culture jokes) between characters from popular TV shows or teen angst movies, then 20 minutes of wandering around to build suspense that is ineffective because everything has a familiar and predictable feel. The wandering around ends when the stupidest character reads a newspaper clipping (killers love to make scrapbooks, always) and gets killed before he can warn anyone. Instead of using creative writing the writers make the characters so stupid that that they put themselves in dangerous situations; unfortunately, people like seeing whimpering Nimrods die which makes suspenseful pacing becomes wasted time. What's with the gratuitous ammo wasting (a trained policeman firing randomly into the dark and his son waiting until the bandits are acres away before shooting)? When the daughter was heard screaming in the trailer why did the helpless mother and older daughter go see what was going on instead of the men with guns; somebody dangerous set your dad on fire(he didn't spontaneously combust), and now that person is raping your sister. When the dog was attacking the ax wielding ogre, why not take the chance to bash the ogre's brains in instead of poorly barricading yourself in a plywood bathroom? So you shot Mr. Cleft lip in the arm and he fell... shoot him in the head! Don't put your gun down right next to him; you don't know how many other mutants there are out there, and he might be playing possum. Plus, the mutant that was feeding on your mom was 30 feet away and unarmed... do you take time to aim a shot to kill him? No. What you do is waste all your shots while running away just to set up an overly elaborate trailer explosion. I am not impressed with the writing of this film, the only thing clever about it were the make-up/blood effects, but everything else has been done so many times that i could hardly get excited about anything happening on screen. I am a fan of B-Movies, and there is fun to be had here (the audience was not scared at all but laughing the whole time), but please, no more hurried remakes, people! These are the movies that got me into horror, and you are beginning to hurt my feelings as well as insult my intelligence.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cinema that makes you want to shower,"Tonight I went to see, ""The Hills Have Eyes"" with my sister, roommate, and another friend of ours. While the film showed spurts of originality, it was generally predictable. The only thing in it that shocked me was how far they went. The first word that comes to mind is ""exploitation"" and the second is ""rape"".And I don't mean that I found the rape scene to be explicit... what I mean is that I find the idea of forcing a woman's shirt open while you have a gun pointing at her infant is putting something in my head that I would have never agreed to be placed there. There is some level of... trust that you give a director, a producer, a writer when you go to see their film.You have come to be frightened. To gasp. To jump. To walk outside seventy minutes later feeling like everything is fine and you don't live in the desert anyway. You don't come to leave with a headache, arguing with your friends about how they movie simply WENT TOO FAR.Sitting in the theater I literally felt like someone was taking my deep love and attachment to my own family and using it to horrify me. Let me explain. I like being scared. I like being on roller coasters that go upside down and take sharp turns. But once, I went on a roller coaster that wasn't just going upside down ¬ñ it was starting and stopping so quickly that it threw me around and bruised me up. It wasn't just scary, in fact, it wasn't very scary at all. It just hurt a whole lot.At the point where I was beyond being frightened and started to feel hurt, I saw a couple a few rows in front of me get up and walk out. It was like someone had stopped the ride. I didn't have to be subjected to something just because I was in the middle of the row. I got up and walked out, too.According to my friends, the rest of the movie was mostly predictable. The ending a little less so. The four of us went outside and started chatting.""I wanted to walk out when you did,"" my sister explained, ""but I wanted to know what happened. I wanted to see the people triumph."" ""They went too far,"" was all I could say.At this moment, all I feel like doing is calling the director and the writer(s) of that movie and telling them that every penny they make off that movie is blood money. That they didn't create the kind of movie that scares you and then slowly fades away when you step outside the theater. That the monsters in the movie aren't mutated miners ¬ñ that the REAL monsters in the movie are all named in the credits.I may not be able to get back the $6.50 I spent to be violated on a Friday night, but I hope I can do one small things. I can stop other people from making the same mistake. Don't go The Hills Have Eyes. It's disgusting. And PLEASE don't go see it JUST to see how DISGUSTING it is.

The most shocking scene was obviously the part where the guy wakes up in a box filled with bodyparts. I would have thrown up. Also, the shotgun suicide scene was amazingly IN YOUR FACE. I was shocked at how that girl from LOST played a ditz without an accent. Of course, the JUPITER character at the end is the ""your friend died like a pig"" thug from the Untouchables.

Repugnant,"Vile degenerative schlock that passes for horror these days. The great debate between horror fans I suppose will always be is horror supposed to be scary or is it supposed to be shocking and stomach-churning. I favor the former but this is the latter. First, the original movie did not need to be remade. But I realize that argument is a lost cause in this creatively bereft age for films, particularly horror films. Remakes are and have been a constant for the last decade. They almost always are terrible of course and a pale shade of the original film. But it doesn't matter. Money talks and people keep watching these things so they keep being made.The favorable reviews for this remake seem to mostly drool over the gross, bloody, rapey shock value of it like that is what a good horror film should be about. Clearly there are those who feel that way and as I've stated, I am not one of them. So if you like that sort of thing check it out and become a little bit worse inside.

It is pretty formulaic, but even if a film is somewhat formulaic, it can be entertaining, well this movie has it's moments, but unfortunately the moments come far and few in between. The acting is suitable but everything is kind of blah. The violence is too graphic for my taste and the characters are pretty boring. Well, bobby and Doug are kinda interesting, but the rest of them just don't have enough depth. The suspense is there, although there are other scary films that have much better suspenseful scenes.

Excellent Remake of an old classic,"Well, when I first rented this movie I thought it would be a slow-paced raw and gory film, But as soon as the violence started to show up I suddenly changed my mind, (But it was gory) The movie is totally awesome, especially for being a remake of an film from the 70-80:ies. I recommend it for people who doesn't get disturbed or find violence disgusting. The story itself reminded me a lot of the well-known movies named The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and a pretty new movie named Wrong Turn, but as we all know, T.T.C.M. and the original movie The Hills Have Eyes were made and released years ago.

plenty graphic,"In my recent search to find a descent horror flick, ""The Hills Have Eyes"" was my next choice. Being born and raised in New Mexico, I am always interested in movies that are either filmed there or claim to take place there. Now that I live in St. Louis, I am a big critic of ""New Mexico"" movies. First off, the opening scene had me laughing hysterically. I love how they made the desert look more like Mars. It was obviously not filmed there. There are a lot of directing mistakes, mainly in geography. First off, there is no Hwy 88. I also know that parts of NM (like near Lordsburg and Alamogordo) look pretty desolate, but it's not as bad as shown in the movie. I'm also surprised how these ""creatures"" keep sneaking up on the characters in the wide open desert. Here are a few more mistakes: there are no mosquitoes in NM--it's the desert--remember? Also, if it's supposed to be the middle of summer, why are they wearing pants and jackets when it would be 95-105 degrees outside? There was gore galore and a few ""jump out of your seat"" scenes. I was a little weary to watch the scenes with the baby (being a mom, it was hard to think what they might have done to her). I also don't like how they portrayed the mom. Why do they always make them sound so stupid? ie- ""oh, honey it's probably just a coyote....""

Solid Remake of a Wes Craven Classic,"This film I actually saw in the theaters when it came out with a bunch of friends. I would have been the only horror fan and it would have been right after my freshman year of college. I'll admit, I loved it after that initial viewing. I'm sure I had seen the original and during that time, would have said this was better. I've seen it a few times throughout the years, but this is only the second time with a critical eye. This is thanks to the Summer Challenge Series for the Podcast Under the Stairs and for October Movie Challenges as well. The synopsis here is a family falls victim to a group of mutated cannibals in a desert far away from civilization.We begin with two men in hazmat suits. They are trying to take fishes from a creek and collecting samples. The reason is that there's a text before hand about all of the nuclear bomb testing done in the desert. The government claims it doesn't have any effects on genetics. These people are they are attacked by a deformed person who is very strong. A sign is also shown that a nuclear bomb testing site is nearby.We shift to a gas station attendant, played by Tom Bower. He thinks he hears something and he begins to yell at someone named Ruby (Laura Ortiz). He doesn't find anyone, but there's a bag full of things is left outside of his door. He tells whoever brought it that he is done and will no longer be helping them. When he starts to look through the items, there's a Styrofoam container with an ear in it.Then a vehicle and a trailer pull up. The driver is Big Bob (Ted Levine). He's honking his horn for service. With him is his wife Ethel (Kathleen Quinlan). His eldest daughter is Lynn (Vinessa Shaw) and she's married to Doug (Aaron Stanford). They have a baby named Catherine (Maisie Camilleri Preziosi) with them. Big Bog and Ethal have two more kids of Brenda (Emilie de Ravin) and Bobby (Dan Byrd). Big Bob inquires about getting back to the highway. At first, the attendant is directing them back, but then tells them about a road that isn't on the map that will save time.They take this route and we see that someone has a spike strip that punctures all of their tires. This causes them to crash into a rock, busting the axle and totaling the vehicle. The damage cannot be fixed so it is decided that Doug will continue on the road and Big Bob will go back to the gas station. Bobby is left in charge and he is upset with Brenda when she lets the dogs out of the trailer. There are a male and female going by the names of Beast and Beauty. He gives chase and hears a cry. He then finds Beauty gutted. In a panic to flee, he trips and falls, knocking himself out. A young girl that we learn is Ruby watches over him. She's alone with Cyst (Greg Nicotero) watching from above, eating part of Beauty.Things don't go well for the two guys. Doug finds a crater full of abandoned vehicles. He takes a bunch of items he finds and heads back. Big Bob makes it to the gas station by nightfall, where he finds the attendant drunk in the outhouse. He kills himself and Big Bob is stalked by something in the darkness. These people live and hunt here, with this family as their next prey.I want to start out here stating that I've always liked this version and feel it is a pretty solid remake. This one does have the feel of being a completely different movie while bringing back some key scenes from the original in my opinion. There is one thing I will say here is that I do thing the reason they're out here is a bit weak compared to the original, but I can also still believe it.Something that actually is funny for me to think back on was when I first saw this. I thought that it was really brutal. I'm not saying that isn't the case now, it just isn't as nearly violent as I remember from that first viewing. That doesn't even really start until the last like 20-30 minutes of the movie as well and it isn't as much as I was thinking. I do think the brutality that we get to come over the character is good as well. Doug is mocked by Big Bob and even to extent Bobby for being a Democrat and not wanting to use guns. We see though that even someone like him has this violent person inside.I want to shift this over to the idea of the mutants living out in the desert. The original builds them up as inbred over a couple of generations. This one leans more into this group of miners decided to stay on their land and hid in the mines when the bombs were tested. I've heard on the Summer Challenge Series episode say I don't think the changes that came over them would happen like they do and thinking on it, I agree. The children could be altered, but this is literally just people living here for 50 years. I also don't really buy the super strength we get from Pluto (Michael Bailey Smith). That opening scene really didn't hold up for me.Before moving on I just want to delve a bit more into the family dynamic. Big Bob is a former police detective and Levine does a great job in the role. I even think that Quinlan supports him well in the role of Ethel. Byrd works as this different take on the Bobby character and I like what de Ravin does as Brenda. She is more outspoken, but I think that is her age and not wanting to be there. She gets attacked in the trailer in a heinous way that it gives us a satisfying change in her character. It takes her through a few stages of accepting what happened. I've leaned into how they portray Doug and Stanford plays it well. Shaw is fine as his wife as well.Then to take this to the mutants where I think their make-up looks really despite my issues. Smith has imposing size and makes a good Pluto. Robert Joy as Lizard I really like and it makes sense how he plays the role. Aside from that, Cyst looks good, but with his age he shouldn't be that deformed. Billy Drago is an interesting take on Papa Jupiter, but he really doesn't stand out to me. The others are bit a much for the concept, but the make-up is good.The other part of the effects to delve into would be the attacks. I think overall they lean into it being practical and it looks good. The blood, gore and other visceral fluids are all things that worked for me. There is an odd zoom into what happens with Big Bob that I hated. It took me out of it. Some of things with super strength turned me off as well and there is a bit of CGI that just didn't hold up. Aside from these issues, the cinematography was solid.So now with that said, I still am positive on this movie, I'm just not where I was after that original viewing. The changes made from the original film work for the most part, but I've come to see that the Wes Craven version is superior. This isn't as violate as I thought, but that's not to say it doesn't have its moments. The acting is solid across the board. There are some minor issues with the effects, but the practical were done by Nicotero and Howard Berger was behind them. The back-story doesn't fit necessarily and it runs a bit long for its own good. The last thing would be the soundtrack fit, but not one that really stood out to me. I would say my rating is has come up from the last time I saw this. It is an above average movie in my opinion just with some slight issues preventing it from going higher.My Rating: 7.5 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
And they're watching.,"'The Hills Have Eyes (2006)' is a remake of Wes Craven's 1977 film of the same name. It follows the plot of its source material pretty closely, with some minor alterations being made in an effort to up the impact of its already unsettling violence. You can tell that director Alexander Aja is coming off the back of 'Switchblade Romance (2003)', an entry in the New French Extremity movement, because he really goes all out with the more unpleasant aspects of this picture. In some ways, that's a positive; it contributes to the movie's genuinely grimy vibe and often hard-to-watch nature. In some ways, that's a negative; it often favours shock value over actual horror and is arguably somewhat irresponsible in its depictions of certain types of violence (the women essentially all exist to be assaulted, with the intention being to scare the audience with the cruelty inflicted upon them). I'm torn on the piece because it captures that nasty, dead-soaked feeling of the original and is well-made in almost every aspect, but it often doesn't do the work needed to build genuine scares and instead settles on being as outright gross and upsetting as possible in the hope that the two elements will be conflated with one another. It features the trifecta of trigger warnings: rape/sexual assault, suicide, and violence against children and animals. It seems to only include these elements for the sake of being edgy and, almost, traumatic, never really earning their inclusion (I understand it's tied to the original in some ways and that said film does the same thing, but this interpretation doubles down on most of these aspects in a way that feels more concerned with pushing the envelope than telling a compelling story).There's a scene about halfway through that's absolutely horrific, the sort of thing that makes your heart sink and your stomach twist itself in knots. It's more than squirm in your seat, it's downright distressing. If you've ever experienced anything close to it in reality, I can see how it could really mess you up. It would be tempting to say that the scene is successful because it's supposed to be vile and difficult to sit through, but the more you think about it, the more you realise that it's a pretty cheap way to get your audience hiding behind their seats. Although its somewhat slow first half is portentous, the movie doesn't really build an atmosphere that matches the intensity of the scene in question (and it's difficult to tell if the dread it conjures is due to the filmmaking itself or due to the fact that you already know where the picture is heading, at least in the vaguest sense, whether or not you've seen the original simply because it so obviously occupies a certain genre). The caravan attack doesn't quite come out of nowhere, but the abrupt increase in sheer savagery creates a whiplash effect that isn't really earned. Arguably worse than the sequence itself is the direction the picture takes in its aftermath. While the remainder of the picture is filled with buckets of blood, bodily harm and generally grotesque imagery, it shifts its focus from nihilistic dismay to (cautiously) cathartic exploitation with a series of scenes in which a certain character becomes a bit of an action man and gets into a few scrapes that aim to be entertaining in their own, genre-specific way (there's a scene in which he fights a guy who's basically a cross between Sloth and Jason and it almost feels like something out of a different movie). The feature is never able to coalesce its two thematic modes. As a result, not only is it an imbalanced and incohesive narrative experience, it also feels somewhat distasteful. The violence against women it depicts (which is primarily sexual) feels like it only exists to allow the male characters to take revenge later on, even if it is intended to up the stakes of the overall situation, which cheapens it and makes it rather problematic. Another problem is the fact that the picture links physical differences directly to abhorrent behavior, making the classic mistake of having its 'monsters' look atypical and driving at least some of its horror from that aspect. That's obviously an irresponsible thing to do, but it would perhaps be a difficult thing for the filmmakers to escape considering their source material basically demands its inclusion in one way or another. The attempts to garner a smidgeon of sympathy for its antagonists by emphasising the man-made reason for their current condition doesn't actually absolve any of the issues regarding representation and stereotype reinforcement, either.Ultimately, though, while this does have a lot of flaws, it also isn't too out of keeping with either its source material or some of its peers. Its technical aspects are typically rather strong, and it does succeed in making you squirm. It definitely isn't a nice experience. It's better than a lot of 2000s horror remakes, and is probably of a similar quality to the original (although it should have known better in some areas since it's nearly 30 years younger). It's not a bad effort, but that scene definitely didn't need to be as explicit as it is and I also can't deny that a lot of the film's choices backfire.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Okay remake. Given the choice, see the original for real fright.","This remake of the Wes Craven classic is nowhere near as good. Certainly it has some great moments and visual images and the idea of a ""modern"" family having to fight off a family of savages is a frightening one, but some where along the way it lost its teeth. Certainly the fact that the studio asked that some of the more subversive touches of the original (baby for dinner anyone?) be trimmed doesn't help. It also doesn't help that this film has inspired countless remakes an homages over the last 30 years. Worse, I don't know how many retreads I saw in the last year. Why remake a film if you're going to de-claw it and then take the same path as every other film maker. Its pointless. Worse its about 20 minutes longer than the original film and as a result this film tends to stagger about for a good while before it seems to get its focus. Its not bad, but the remake is better and more out there. Given the choice, see the original.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good Job! Alexandre Aja! A very disturbing Good horror movie!,"After seeing this movie for the first time in the theater, the only thing came to my mine was : WOW! What a horror movie should be! Indeed, this movie is outstanding of its genre. The atmosphere set in this film was brilliant. Fast pace, and bloody which is necessary for this kind of film. Everything is perfect including the scoring. The whole movie is quite disturbing - which is the major reason I would give all my credits to it. Very disturbing. The best scene, personal opinion, is the trailer scene when the burning on the body tied on the tree and the rape is happening in the trailer. Very disturbing and scary as well. I would say the trailer scene can be one of my ten favorite ""scary"" or ""disturbing"" scenes. Very brilliant. Good job director Alexandre Aja!",,Anonymous,Horror
Lots of gore but had a nice ending with thoughts of a part 2.... Not for 11 year olds!,"The 11 y/o I usually pal out with and I wanted to see this movie. Apparently, the previews we THOUGHT were for this particular movie were DEFINITELY not for this movie!! The movie was well-paced and had some blood and gore in it that made one lady in the theater scream!! (I, on the otherhand, was laughing hysterically because this grown lady screamed, haha- cruel, I know) There's a part with LOTS of stuff going on at once and all I could do was bite my nails and say over and over again, ""OMG! OMG! OMG!"" and it was WAY too much going on in the movie for my little buddy and he started crying and we had to leave for a little bit until he settled down. The rest of the movie wasn't too graphically violent or gory or anything like that, I found a good bit of it amusing as well (when some bad guys got killed, etc.). I'd go back and watch the movie again(with another unsuspecting child--- JK!) to see the 10 minute interval that I'd missed and the story was pretty well setup too. Kinda reminded me of Texas Chainsaw Massacre though...",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Solid, well made movie","I am ashamed having to admit that I have not seen the original. But I liked this version very much. It is not exactly a scary movie; but being scary is not its goal. It is quite unsettling and very well-made in terms of cinematography, directing, acting and soundtrack. It is a story of a family, and the characters are very well presented, offering some surprising and convincing development. The plot is very solid, too. There were no moments when I kept asking myself: why the hell is he/she doing this or what the hell is happening now?.. The plot is much more clear and comprehensible than in most of the horror movies which tend to be vague and 'mystifying' for one simple reason, namely not having a credible idea or explanation for what is happening and why.For me, it is rather a quite emotional family drama than a horror movie. But it surely has its deal of shocking moments and unsettling atmosphere, so I clearly recommend it to any horror film fan to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
These Hills Definitely Have More Than Eyes,"I feel that a remake is only fairly judged in comparison to the original. If a bad remake is made, it should receive less respect for ruining a good idea. If a better remake is made, it should be praised for its improvement. But one thing we should never do is give credit to the new movie for things already established in the old movie (why give a writer or director credit for something they just copied?).I ma pleased to say this remake was exactly the best it could have been. It kept all the best scenes, all the best dialogue and added to them. The gore was increased, a whole new extended scene was inserted. The opening credits added more to the feel of the movie than the entire 1970s version had at all. The only thing lacking is the experience of a 70s/80s film you can only get from the the original (or from ""The Devil's Rejects""), but this is also a strength... allowing us to identify better with the new characters and add the new aspect of cellular technology.The story, as you may know, is that of a family stranded in the desert by a nuclear testing site. They are soon attacked by a clan of radiation-affected mutants who also like the taste of human flesh.There isn't much to say. If you like a good survival story or a gorefest, this is a fine film. If you liked the original, you'll probably like this better. I have heard that this director is ""the new Wes Craven"". Not true... he is much better than Craven can ever be (see ""Cursed""). I will gladly see his next film.Bottom line: horror movies should not be remade, and neither should most other movies. This film, however, is the one exception to that rule.

"A worthy remake, finally.","The Hills Have Eyes is a shock a minute thriller directed by Alexandre Aja. His modern adaptation of Wes Craven's original has had audiences around the world horror struck and terrorized.The Hills Have Eyes follows a family traveling cross country from Cleveland to California. Big Bob and Ethel Carter are celebrating their 25th Wedding Anniversary along with their kids and their daughter's fianc√© and toddler. Naturally, being a horror movie, the get some bad directions and are catapulted into a forsaken 50's nuclear testing zone. Slowly but surely they realize that there are people living in the hills of the sharp, edgy landscape, and all hell ensues. This is a survival film, and how one family invades another's territory; they just happen to be radioactive, cannibal mutants.This film throws real characters into a beyond belief situation, which some people may find difficult to trust. But for those who are just interested in a good, gripping movie, then this is it. The characters in this feature bring compassion and drive. In particular Doug (Aaron Stanford), a whimsical, spineless, Democrat who provides comic relief when necessary. His relationship with his wife and toddler, Catherine, is one to be admired and is the over all force in the film. He is a character who grows and develops from being the coward we laugh at to being the heroic and intrepid character we cheer for. Stanford's all out performance brought tears to my eyes and gave me goosebumps.His gripping performance is supported by two upcoming young actors, Emilie DeRavin and Dan Byrd,. They play the young adolescent siblings who still get embarrassed by their father's singing. They create another reason why we want this family to survive. Bobby (Byrd)is a lovable teen who only wants the best for his family and is torn between his father's ways and those of Doug. Brenda (DeRavin) is an average teenager who just wants to spend her summer with her friends at the beach. Their realistic acting intensify the story.This movie is savage, brutal, but also very moving. This is due to an excellent cast, magnificent special effects, interesting script and creative directing. The Hills Have Eyes is probably one of the only remakes that has more of a psychological impact than the original. Wes Craven should be proud.I recommend this movie to those who aren't afraid of blood or mutants. This movie I guarantee will have you scared out of your wits.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Gladly this movie has a descent score on the site , one that i actually almost agree with so this movie doesn't get underrated for some stupid reasons. The cast is good and the plot is good too even though its not an original one , The tension is kept through all of the movie since the beginning of the action till the credits . I guess this is one of few remakes that is actually better than the original.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Starts well, but degenerates soon afterwards","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningThe sneaky peeps in the US government conduct a series of radiation tests in the American outback that leave a number of the locals who inhabit the place deformed, deranged and psychotic. When a suburban American family breakdown there during a cross-country road trip, they find themselves trapped in a desperate battle between themselves and deformed monsters with an insatiable blood lust.Here we have a glossy Hollywood remake of a low budget Wes Craven horror flick from the 70s. Which, of course, I've never seen. In fact the first I knew about it was when I saw it advertised on the side of a bus. Never mind, though, I wasn't around for the original Dawn of the Dead and still thoroughly enjoyed the recent re-make. Which sadly isn't the case with this one.To be fair, it does open fairly well and delivers a promising start to what could be a great horror film. But it soons degenerates, with a clich√©d, predictable set-up, a torrent of blood and gore that can't generate one great scare and some laughably misfiring monster make up/design.

When night falls, the blood hits the fan.Director Alexandre Aja pushes the violence and gore levels into the ultra-red zone, making his remake a very grisly tribute. The real difference between the two films comes in the final act, when Aja opts to dig into what he hinted at during the opening credits, and show the truth behind the murdering mutants. This is also the most visceral part of the movie.

Eat them up,"Sick remake of old cult horror classic about a family stranded in the desert, at war with a family of bizarre killers. The gore quotient is satisfying, and the production values are first-rate. Shot in Morocco, of all places. Ted Levine of MONK fame plays the dad, and the cast is peppered with several other familiar faces. The only problem with this remake, we've seen this story played out in so many movies over the years, most recently WRONG TURN and, to a lesser extent, the remake of HOUSE OF WAX. So it becomes more difficult to offer up something new or different by way of shock or scares.

The great horror movie of the world!!!!!!!,"This film was great how the characters acted especially Doug and bobby. The mutants, Pluto, lizard and cyst are my favourite mutants because lizard is quite cool, Pluto is big and strong but very stupid and cyst looks scary but is ab it weak. Goggle, papa Jupiter and big Brian are boring characters because there cowards, gay and pussy's. The plot of the story is very good like tests, nuclear bombs, ugly mutations blah blah blah and how they must rescue there Babbie before its dinner to ass mite cannibals. Sorry but i think some of the women didn't even try to live as there crap but Brenda was good at surviving. Bobby is a hard ass ed teenager who hates all the mutants so much, man! He is hard core! Doug is really cool and its cool that he kills two mutants, Pluto and cyst, and wounding lizard! He just do-sen't give up for his lovely daughter, Cathrine or something i don't know.

shows what can be good- and not so good- about a remake,"Maybe I shouldn't be looking to making overt comparisons to the Wes Craven 1977 cult film The Hills Have Eyes, of which this Alejandre Aja filmed remake has done over Hollywood style, and just look at it on terms of just being a horror film in and of itself. But even on its own I found this film to just not work for me, even as I recognized things that I admired about it. And maybe it's because I decided to watch the 1977 original earlier this week that that film is so fresh in my mind that I can't help but make comparisons. However, when you are remaking a film that already has a flaw or two, you can either improve, be on par, or just not be as good as that film, or just be so-so on its own terms. Co-writer/director Aja has a film here that does work for its target audience- the young teen horror fan crowd looking for a quick fix of gore and cheap scares done in a somewhat shaky-hand held camera style. But the problem for me was a little more elemental.For all of Craven's film's shortcomings- mostly by budget and time- was made up for by being a sharply entertaining exploitation flick, building on both the good and evil sides of the characters. This time, Aja is content with making a decent enough set-up for the first half hour or so, and then just plunging the viewer into a kind of checklist horror movie kind of layout. This is not to say he doesn't use the big-studio backup for some good; the makeup by Greg Nicotero on the deformed mutant villains is very cool and creative; the gore factor (not that I was necessarily relying on it for scares, which it didn't really) was very high and well laid out; the performances by the family, for the first half of the film, are believable enough with the dialog. But the problem for me lies in that the second half of the film, where Aja could make this good versus evil struggle scary and intense, into being slightly boring.Not withstanding the fact that 80% of the original is transplanted (sometimes seemingly with the same shots and angles) into the remake, the new ideas put into the film also aren't launched off with enough to really engage. And then there are the action/bloody horror scenes, where Aja has his fun pitting these quasi super-mutants against our can't-be-beat heroes (one of which seems to survive and fight back with an incredible suspension of disbelief for one), but its not really that per say. So yes, there's more gore than the first go-around, yes, there are some added disturbing elements (i.e. a rape scene, not as disturbing as in some films but gruesome enough), and yes, the twist factor is turned up to 10. But with the turns of the horror-film screw, I just didn't get involved, even in separating myself from the original. And the fact that the mutants are very robotic-like in their pursuit of their semi fish-in-a-barrel takes some of the jump out of some of the could-be scares. It will please many, and if you are just a general horror film fan (and R-rated I mean, it doesn't cheap out on that end) you'll want to check it out). But it's a 'meh' in terms of it being engaging film-making.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

I finally gave it a watch 3 or so years ago and I have to say I wasn't scarred at all, but boy was I entertained. This goes on the list of the best remakes. The characters weren't your average stupid people, just an unlucky family. I did find it strange that all these people go missing, including scientists and no one looks for them. This film builds enough suspense , not letting you fully see the mutants. Then they show them in full, they weren't scary but they definitely were sadistic. The last half becomes a revenge action movie. There is a great and bloody fight scene, and large amounts of blood and body parts, more than enough for any horror fan.

The Worst Movie I've EVER Seen,"I saw this movie a few months back and was deeply disgusted at the theatrics that were contained. Now, I'm not one that is sickened by the sight of blood, but the gore in the movie got to be so overdone, it became quite ridiculous and unneeded to support the story plot- blood doesn't need to be splattered over every single inch of the wallpaper to prove your point that the man is dead. That point was made ten minutes ago when they were massacring every other single character in the movie.That fact that the baby died was a disgusting portrayal of ""horror"". It was just plain disgusting and rude! You do NOT need to kill everyone in the entire movie to prove your point that it was a scary place, a few characters will suffice.Another thing that bugged me is the ""deformed humans"" that are the villains in the movie. I'm not regularly a human rights activist in any way, but the way that they were portrayed in the movie made me disgusted and probably lost a large percentage of the viewers on look of dis-formed people, lessening them in stature.I think this is a HORRIBLE movie and should not be seen by anyone!

skillfully constructed gore flick,"After ""High Tension"" my expectations regarding Aja's next movie was very high. I feel fully satisfied and I think that followers of extremely brutal gore flicks from the 1970s will be as well. ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is a remake of Was Craven's classic slasher. Even though the film is not an exact adaptation, it retains the climate of the original. Alike Aja's previous flick, this one keeps in incessant suspense and daring gory scenes occur, therefore it's not a film aiming at teenagers or people with weak stomach. Furthermore, the plot is well-developed and characters with their well-outlined traits are characteristic and likable. I only would rather they behaved more rationally in some scenes. For instance, the scene when the main hero leaves a gun by his victim is very hackneyed. Nevertheless, the transformation of the main hero who has to radically change his attitude to violence and become 'killing machine' is believable and fully explicable. ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is also perfect from the technical side. The film is well-shot on desert location and both mutants' make-up and set design are abominable and great at the same time. All in all, every hardcore horror fan should see this flick.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Pretty effective cheesy and gruesome fun,"Recent notable Alexandra Aja's The Hills Have Eyes begins in fairly awesome fashion, roaring out of the gates with a rather spectacular bit of murder. It may be holding to a standard slasher trope but it does it well, its a ballsy, exuberant piece of mayhem that gets things moving in just the right way. Sadly the film then sets about doing its best to undo this fine work, tiresomely moving back down the gears in its mishandled build up to its later shenanigans. The trouble is with the characters, or rather lack of them, writers Aja and Gregory Levasseur adopt the cheap shot approach to writing characters, piling up the symbols of a clich√©s eye view of Americana, guns, god and government, with a prominently shown American flag to drive home the impressionthat this isn't just any family we are watching but an American one writ large. The cast do well, but their roles are woven around careless emblems rather than genuine attempts to conceive worthwhile characters, as a result it appears that the makers care not for their characters, only the terrible scrapes that befall them. As a result I cared even less than I usually would, and so all the period of calm before the storm that the film takes is rather humdrum. The second half boasts some great fare though, brutal violence and bloody gore, smart pacing and generous quantities of cheese, its pretty darned silly but it works because if nothing else, Aja really knows his way around a violent set piece. He knows his way around a location as well, soaring camera and ruminating takes give the desert location a suitably desolate grandeur, while the cinematography of Maxime Sendre brings out a certain doomed and rusted out atmosphere. The Kurtzmann, Nicotero and Berger team do a fantastic job of effects as well, savage splatter rendered with grim realism is the order of the day here, as well as some effectively gnarled designs for the twisted desert dwellers. Acting wise everyone is solid, Ted Levine an effectively gruff patriarch, Aaron Stanford essays a fair badass in the films more ludicrous moments, while Kathleen Quinlan, Vinessa Shaw and Emilie de Ravin all get to run through fear, screams and brutalisation, all coming off relatively sympathetic in the process. Undoubted highlight though was Robert Joy as the liveliest and most talkative of the mutant enemy. Making good use of quirky looks under make-up his leering, grotesque enthusiasm is a pleasure to watch, skin crawling villainry that steals every scene in which he appears. Overall this is pretty decent stuff, but it never made me care. Mishandled elements in the writing, a certain smugness, various silly moments in the second half as it adopts the manner of an action film, all this brings the film down to a pure and simple level of cheesy fun. Problem is, it just isn't joyful enough for this approach to really work, so the film rather lacks in impact. Still, its quite well done stuff, a pretty good time. Reasonably recommended at least.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Pretty good remake,"I am something of a classic horror aficianodo and Wes Craven fan. I went into this film preparing to be disappointed and was pleasantly surprised. The film does a good job of being faithful to the original but adds some new aspects and updated special effects (but not too much to be over the top) to make the film good. I would still recommend the original, even though it is certainly dated in its special effects and limited by its shoe-string budget.Make no doubt about it, the film is pretty intense, gory and brutal--definitely not for the faint of heart. It does, however, have its share of starts and I jumped a few times--which isn't easy to make me do.Basically, the plot revolved around a typical middle class family which gets lost in the desert and is attacked by a feral family that lives in the hills. By the end, however, you are supposed to be asking yourself who the real savages are. In this respect, the re-makers stay true to the original film. In this version, however, we find out more about the feral family and why they are the way they are.The film does a very good job at creating suspense and using subtle effects (sounds, music) to generate fear without necessarily utilizing typical gore.

Terrible,"Frankly, I hated this movie. Ironically, I would've enjoyed it - and still been extremely scared - if they had left the graphic rape scenes out. They were unnecessary; they made me feel extremely violated and angry and I had to force myself to watch the end of it. What angered me the most was the fact that the women are completely helpless. I know that in horrible situations people react differently, but I thought that making *every single woman in the film* incapable of defending herself was not necessary. It's easy to fall back on rape to make everyone in the audience feel uncomfortable, rather than create a scary atmosphere with music, lighting, etc. Horrible, horrible film.

Not leaving any details of mutilation out, The Hills Have Eyes is hard on the eyes, but keeps the audience entertained throughout. I must admit that the film is definitely a little corny and the way the mutants look is sure to make someone laugh but the new ""trailer"" scene is bound to leave no smile on anyone's face. I was so impressed by this scene that I really feel that this could be one of the better horror films this year just due to that one particular scene.

This degrades everything about film-making and the art of cinema because of a nobody director who would stop at nothing at getting media attention. Sad but true what some will do to get known.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Decent Remake,"Hills Have Eyes, The (2006)** 1/2 (out of 4)Alexandre Aja's remake of Wes Craven's 1977 shocker about a family who gets stranded in the dessert just in time to become dinner for some mutants. Craven's film is one of the greatest of the genre and remains a high point in the director's career as well as the horror genre overall. It's also a personal favorite of mine so I was interesting in seeing what Aja did with him version. Just like Haunte Tension, the director pulls out some great stuff but also some weak stuff. You can tell Aja has a very good directing style and this is clear during the first attack on the campsite. The biggest problem I had with the film, as well as the director's first movie, was the violence. I don't think I'm becoming sensitive because I a true, 100% gorehound but the secret behind most slashers is that the violence in never mean spirited. The violence and gore here is just downright cruel, vicious and at time too disturbing to actually enjoy. Craven's film didn't have any gore and instead went for scares and got them. That film, with humans and not mutants like this one, is a masterpiece of suspense and that's why I love it so much. With this film, every time Aja gets the suspense going he throws it out the window with the violence. It was a pleasure to see Ted Levine as the father since he's one of my favorite character actors. Kathleen Quinlan seemed out of place but oh well. The rest of the cast were decent but no better or worse than what we usually get. While the ""humans"" were changed to ""mutants"" this time around, the basic storyline and how things happened all stayed the same down to who gets it and how. I thought a few of the scenes got laughs when they weren't suppose to and the political stuff thrown in was also qutie cheap. I think Aja is going to be very good for the genre but he needs to cut back some.",,Anonymous,Horror
Gore fans unite! The Hills Have Eyes is one solid flick,"Horror movies are in. Big time. They're cheap to make, easy to sell, and almost always make money. Ever since splatter flicks like Saw and the remade Texas Chainsaw Massacre started cutting the movie mustard, Hollywood has been pumping out horror films like water from a sinking dinghy. Yet behind all the flair of Tinseltown's latest line of manufactured monster movies, the audience is left with something to be desired: a horror movie that actually scares.Well, look no further. The Hills Have Eyes, a well-acted, well-directed new slash-and-smash is the film horror fans have been waiting for.Hills begins with a team of sweaty government workers in a desolate New Mexican desert. They are testing for radiation when they are attacked by two hideous men who smash the workers' heads against rocks until they are dead.Then begins the most disturbing opening credits sequence since the movie Se7en, where a collage of horrific footage and photographs is shown like a View-Master from hell, featuring human deformities supposedly caused by nuclear fallout. The film claims that radiation from government A-bomb testing in the southwestern United States caused these deformities as well as the deformities of the villains in the film.The audience is then introduced to the Carters, an all-American suburban family en route to San Diego for vacation. Kathleen Quinlan (Apollo 13) plays Ethel Carter, mother of Lynne (Vinessa Shaw, Melinda and Melinda), Brenda (Lost's Emilie de Ravin) and Bobby (Dan Byrd, A Cinderella Story). Lynne's husband Doug (Aaron Stanford, X2) is a glasses-wearing cellphone salesman who at first seems more affixed to his gadgets than their baby-daughter Catherine.Ted Levine (Memoirs of a Geisha) plays ex-cop/pater familias Big Bob Carter, who learns from a seemingly good-natured, toothless old gas station attendant that a shortcut through the hills exists which could shave hours off the family's venture. What Big Bob doesn't expect is the spike strip laid out a few miles down that shortcut, which causes the tires to blow and the axle to snap in half. He also doesn't anticipate the onslaught of hungry and grossly deformed cannibals come nightfall.Needless to say, Bob Bob's nuclear family is no match for the microwaved mutants from the hills. By the end of the first night, half the family is killed, poor Brenda is molested and raped by a man who closely resembles Sloth from The Goonies, and baby Catherine has a gun pointed at her before she is kidnapped. What follows is an hour of non-stop butt-kicking, ax-swinging, blood-gushing action. The surviving family members take up arms and wage an unholy war against the hill people.Director Alexandre Aja's update of the gritty 1977 Wes Craven film of the same name is a slaughterhouse of a flick. It boils to the brim of decency with maiming, dismemberment and decapitation. In one scene, a man blows his head through the roof of an outhouse with a shotgun, leaving nothing but a bloody stump. Soon after that, another man is burned alive like a witch on a stake while his family helplessly watches. But, shocking violence aside, the film is frightfully entertaining.For once, there are some scares in this movie that actually do scare. One scene in particular has one of the most terrifying jumpers since 1999's The Sixth Sense, and another scene, featuring a character aptly named ""Big Brain,"" is a nightmare waiting to happen.Special effects fans will appreciate the gore galore served up fresh from special effects wizards Howard Berger and Greg Nicotero of K.N.B. EFX Group Inc., Hollywood's premiere gore-makers who have provided stomach-turning effects for films like Hostel and Kill Bill.Aja, who's High Tension was an international hit last summer, is the Wes Craven of this generation. He directs with the skills of a master, achieving a combination of fine acting, great suspense and some jump-inducing scares.All in all, The Hills Have Eyes is the fright-flick many have been waiting for. It delivers goretastic goods like a freight train driven by Jeffrey Dahmer. For moviegoers looking for some toxic terror, see this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Some nice effective modern horror.,"I'm not against remakes in general, since sometimes modern movies can give 'older' movies something extra with a makeover with todays technology and standards. Doesn't mean that I just agree with all remakes, since some of them are just plain pointless since the original ones are already brilliant at their own right. However this is just a remake that I don't mind. To be honest I haven't seen the 1977 Wes Craven original but I'll bet that it was quite different from this movie. This movie is a typical modern horror movie, with a modern atmosphere and style written all over it. I wouldn't at all be surprised if this movie actually turned out to be better than its original.The movie features purely unknown actors, with the exception of Ted Levine perhaps and Kathleen Quinlan also has had her 15 minutes of fame. The fact that this movie purely mostly features unknown actors in it ensures that you just never know in advance who is going to die next. This of course has a successful effect on the tension and therefor the movie overall.Yes, ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is mostly a formulaic genre movie and also story-wise this movie really ain't anything special (basicly the movie is about the one killing after the other) but its simply such a fine made one that you tend to sort of forgive the movie for all of its imperfections.For the genre movie lover this is just one great to watch movie, that features all of the ingredients you would expect from it. Some good scare moments, some fine make-up effects and plenty of good old gore. It's a quality made movie, with a fine crew behind it. Director Alexandre Aja previously had directed the French stylish horror hit ""Haute tension"" and was probably the reason why he got picked to directed this movie.There are definitely worse genre movies to watch out there, especially when it comes down to remakes.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A Horrific, Grotesque, Intense & Above All Fun Ride Through These Hills.","In this remake, we see the family trip take a horrible turn as a mutated family living in the hills in a remote desert take a family hostage. The mutants are bent on revenge and will stop at nothing for blood and carnage.I've yet to see Craven's original, so I can't really compare this remake to it. Although, from what I've heard this remake is far better. If I had seen the original, I would probably agree. Alexandre Aja, who brought us a little french film called ""High Tension"" is at the blood and guts genre again. This time he has more people to slaughter and a great team behind him to bring these horrific mutants to life. What we as an audience get is a sick, twisted, no holds barred horror film that isn't afraid to smack the viewer in the face. With so many horror films playing it ""safe"" in the recent years, Hills Have Eyes is a nice breath of fresh air in the horrors of the horror genre.Alexandre Aja and co manage to create such a creepy and isolated atmosphere, that if there were no mutants at all I would still get the creeps. The hills play characters themselves, as the home to these creatures, they too are frightening. The cinematography is too scare people and it does a pretty decent job at that. How is this film different from other horror films out there today? Well, instead of having a guy kill a bunch of teenagers, we have disfigured mutants kills and raping a family. Yup, a family.Yes, there is a rape scene, and while it's not as horrific as some may have it seem be, you still have that uncomfortable feeling when it starts to play out. With the girl getting beaten by her attacker, then raped. While this may seem tame compared to the women beating of ""Ichi The Killer"", this film if more mainstream, so you can sense of surprised face when I saw it.There are two scenes that are the highlights of Hills, one is when the mutants first attack the family, which is where the rape takes place. The second is when one of the family members goes to the mutants ""home"" and is basically a killing machine. I can watch the most horrific thing happen to a human being, but when an animal gets hurt, that's when it hits me. Yes, a dog dies in this film, but the other dog makes up for it by kicking some major ass.The blood and gore? Plenty. One to keep the gore hounds happy. Hills showcases a mix of CGI and prop deaths. Along with the effects from the brilliant minds of KNB (oldschool Evil Dead, I love these guys). Seeing the mutants is fun too, even if you can't remember the names of any of them. They are cool to look at and all, but not very memorable.Throughout the film I got a vibe from The Dawn of the Dead remake...mostly from the opening credits, and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the films look and feel. Hills is one of the better remakes to come out of the bag in recent years. With other films like The Fog and The Omen appearing, Hills Have Eyes can stand proud to be the best of the bunch. I can see good things from Alexandre Aja in the future of horror.Hills is an excellent horror experience, it has the right amount of creepy scares and more then enough uncomfortable gore. I found the performances to be surprisingly well done for a horror film, that is about mutated cannibals. This film is a horrific, grotesque, intense & above all fun ride through these hills.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Well Done Piece,"Alexandre Aja's vision (or version) of Wes Craven's movie from 1977 belongs to the few remakes of a horror classic that are well done. But if I had to choose (forced by some alien superpower), I would still prefer Wes Craven's movie, I just like that 70s vibe a lot. Anyway, Ajas The Hills Have Eyes is also a fine and bloody pleasure to watch, and worth your time. Aja's piece got everything I crave for watching these kind of movies - it's nasty, it's disturbing and disgusting, that's how that kind of movies should be - a bad trip to hell without a way back.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Something very wrong....,"There has to come a point where a line is drawn defining that which is entertainment from pure sadism.Given that many people will disagree on where exactly that line should be drawn, this movie still manages to go way beyond what any reasonable human being could call entertainment.Lets be clear, the point of this movie is violence. Any so-called plot is inexpertly slapped on almost as an afterthought it seems. The movie from start to finish is the product of a very sick individual (or individuals) and its my honest belief that using or viewing movies like this as entertainment is extremely unhealthy. There is something very wrong with people who can see this as entertainment and perhaps needs addressing through the realisation that there are positive types of excitement as well as negative ones.Given the nature of the movie, it is almost impossible to grant it any awards for acting ability, script, effects etc because all of these are deeply overshadowed by the gore and negativity this movie exhibits.Needless to say, I didn't thank the friend who took me to see this bilge!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bloody Amazing!!!!!,"This film most definitely has to be one of the best films and remakes i have ever seen in my entire life. I had bought it on DVD off of ebay a few days ago and i had to see what all the fuss was about cause everyone said it was a brilliant film, and man they were right. It was delivered to me one morning, i opened it up and looked at the case and read the description on the back of the cover and thought it would be kinda like wrong turn but this film beats wrong turn, but thats my opinion. Anyway the film starts off with flashbacks of the nuclear bomb testing and how they became deformed, then you got the family who we obviously know they are gonna get stalked by the mutants and get slaughtered which is my type of film. I also liked the way Alexandre Aja tells the story of each person of the family, he don't tell you much but its enough to know about them and i definitely liked the way he kept the mutants mysterious until the scene where they attack the caravan, that was awesome and nice and gory just the way i like it.If its blood, gore and suspense you want in a film then you have to buy or rent this film, close the curtains, turn the lights off and just have fun.I personally found this film bloody brilliant and give Alexandre's remake of the hills have eyes a 10/10.

"It's Your Typical Hollywood Remake, It Exceeds Over Others, But Doesn't Do Much Either","Just got back from an advanced screening so I will make this short and sweet.There is nothing in this movie that makes it great and there is nothing in it that makes it bad. It is predictable, yet it exceeds and surpasses other remakes at least somewhat in character development. It doesn't expect us to shut off our minds, but it doesn't make us think twice either. It has patriotism, and it has gore. When the ending comes, you will be happy that it's over but also clamoring for more.With that said, if you can get free tickets to see this, I would recommend it. If not, there are far better movies coming out to see instead.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
There are people living on those hills,"Remakes, either a clear sign that a particular genre and/or artistic approach is exhausted of original content, or a heart-felt and invigorating tribute to a classic effort of cinematography: opinions diverge and each case seems to be so particular as to render too strict generalizations somewhat trivial.If one is to judge The Hills Have Eyes (2006) on how well it achieved what it set out to accomplish- a truly disturbing, violent and convincing portrait of human depravity- then can is fair to say it is nothing short of brilliant. However, it naturally follows that this is not an experience that everyone is likely to enjoy, it does contain very graphic gore and quite gruesome acts of sheer horror which will obviously alienate a certain audience. But, in a way, that is part of its impact. Horror, and particularly this kind of insane gore-driven horror, is not for everyone.Plot-wise, The Hills Have Eyes is nothing amazing, it follows a pattern that has been long established to explore highly tense situations that include as major elements a complete sense of isolation and vulnerability, which is keenly felt by the victims, and naturally presumes a group of villains to ""ignite"" the action, so to speak. What is quite well conceived is how these basic structured is handled and delivered to the viewing audience.First of all, the setting was simply perfect. The desert is described with a lucid camera, creating a truly bleak and desolate atmosphere that only gains by reiteration. That we are not presented any alternative location only makes the claustrophobia more sublime. Clever light filters transform the world of rocks and ravines into a near surreal worldscape of nightmarish proportions.In terms of character, we are given enough time to empathize with the people of the movie, and even though it is far from being a study on character, there is more attention paid to the emotional interactions of the characters than what one would expect in such a movie. Which is always refreshing as it adds a grim intensity to the horror such characters undergo.Now, for the monsters. Truly disgusting, viciously horrid, mindlessly abject. And amazingly menacing, their presence is enough to make one uncomfortable. Which does say a lot about people in general and how they react to deformity. Yet, in this case, it is simply impossible not to follow the formulaic rhetoric offered, ugly= horrifying.****Spoiler****It should be added, however, that this same logic is not strictly adhered to. Ruby, although not as deformed as her kin, is far from normal and she acts as a redeeming force nonetheless. It could also be said that the very fact that she manages to show and feel mercy is only a proof that the actions of the rest were, indeed, the product of a choice and not the result of a genetic pre-disposition.****End Spoiler****Overall, this is a movie that is not afraid to show violence on screen, a raw and vicious kind of violence that is not diplomatic and makes no compromises with the audience's expectations.And even though The Hills Have Eyes is a cult movie, it is, nonetheless, a coherent work of cinema that displays a mature and sophisticated attitude towards shooting a film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
This is why you go to the movies,"""The Hills have Eyes"" is, without a doubt, the best horror movie I've ever seen. Before true horror buffs burn me at the stake I will confess horror is not my favorite genre, but with movies like this I could be converted.My weekend started with a very disappointing ""V for Vendetta"". I simply concluded ""Not enough violence"". When someone suggested ""The Hills Have Eyes"" I more or less went with the crowd. I soon realized I was not to be disappointed.I'm that guy that reads credits and when I saw Wes Craven's name I almost left the theater. Say what you want about Mr. Craven, but I saw ""Red Eye"", and I hoped Freddy Krueger was going to kill me before I fell asleep. Don't even get my started on ""Cursed"". I will say this much: He does cast beautiful women. Please, I beg, don't let the credits or opening scene distract you from the movie. It's a work of art not to be missed.The movie has great character development. You truly feel as if you're watching your own family. Except for the fact that I instantly fell in love with Brenda (I hope Emilie de Ravin has a long successful career). The mountains, sun, and shadows are filmed to perfection. The cast has the look and mannerisms that make you forget it's a movie. It's as close to real life as you can get. Not enough can be said for every aspect of the movie. It better win awards.Once the horror starts it does not end. The original confrontation between ""good"" and ""evil"" is so intense I don't know if I even took a breath. ""Shock and Awe"" is the only term that can even come close to describing what you'll see. The tone is set, and you know you are in way over your head. The transformation from ""wholesome family"" to ""kill or be killed"" is brilliant. I truly feared for the characters.After leaving the theater I said ""That movie was brilliant!"" I then questioned, ""Are they allowed to show movies like that?"" Every line is crossed. ""Saving Private Ryan"" changed war movies forever, and I predict ""The Hills have Eyes"" will have the same effect to horror movies. My hat is off to director Alexandre Aja. I hope he, and the other genius that worked on this film, continue to bring American movie goers unforgettable films such as ""The Hills have Eyes"".",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
do people have Eyes for the Hills?,"What do you think of the title? Witty, eh? I thought of it myself. *sighs* OK, subject at hand is The Hills Have Eyes. If you're looking for a morose, gory-flick that'll have your date clinging to your arm, this would be a steal at double the price. But if you're looking for an intellectual, provocative heart-stopper with genuine characters... you'll be walking away empty handed. As for me, I'm a mix of both (that being, I didn't have a date) Acting: I'm kind of debating key part of any film. I've never experienced being stalked by fall-out victims from the 50's, but given the unlikely plot... I'd say they did decent. Decent. The actors were the B-Class's best and brightest, including Ted Levine and my personal favorite, Emile de Ravin. She's too fine. uh... back on subject. The characters were flat. The father was a retired serviceman who's a conservative (saw that coming, right) The mother's a... for lack of a better term... a mom. She prays a lot. Ahh, the son. This was an interesting addition. He played a sort of Macauly Caulkin in a post-apocalyptic desert. Only, this was no Home Alone, and there was no Joe Pesci or Daniel Stern! The one that stood out the most was a clich√©' as old as anvils falling on coyote's heads. And that was the outcasted son-in-law/ determined father. Enough said.The part that I thought captivated me the most was pure, un-adulterated chaos that this movie portrayed. And that's basically a 16 year-old, white male speaking. Sure, I'm up for loading buck-shot into freaks that the government left behind. Hey, you won't hear me complain when a cell phone salesman digs a pick into a man's skull. (the cell phone salesman reference is what the determined father does for a living) But that doesn't really make up for a weak story in the long run. Not in my opinion, no.I don't regret seeing it, no, not at all. But it's not one of the situations where ""I love you, but I'm not 'in' love with you"" Readers, it's not even an ""I like you, like you."" It's basically ""hey you're a cool kid, let's hang out!"" no more, no less.When all is said and done, (and dead) I'll give it One-Thumb-Up... and that one thumb's probably for Emile de Ravin and the creative fatalities.-Theodore Reddinger",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
please reconsider watching this film...,"I would like to start out by saying, god this film was awful. Do not give into the blood gore temptation, because if you do, you will be let down, due to the lack of storyline and plot. I know people enjoy the blood gore, I do too, a lot, but not the way this film did it. I saw myself swearing at the TV screen, because I was wondering where the storyline was? I guess this film followed Wes Craven's original, but even considering Wes Craven's film, usually lacks story lines anyways. When someone like Wes Craven and this new director Alexi.. something sticks to 'horror' genre, the public will notice your lack of understanding of total film-making. For instance, David Fintcher, director of Seven, can do horror drama. Or James Cameron, he can do great films like Terminator and T2, The Abyss, Alien, and then do something like Titanic. Really, in regards to the hills have eyes series,(original, 2006 version) grow up! People are getting intellectually demanding with films. Blood and gore will just not cut it anymore.

"Brutal, horrifying, sickening, amazing.","I have been a horror fan sense as long as I can remember. I can not tell you how amazing I thought this movie was. Tryly horrifying, i have never been as scared as i was watching this film. The acting was so good that i really felt invested in the family, and there stories. I cared for each and every member and my heart broke for them when all hell broke loose. This film IS NOT for the average movie goer, i was really shocked to see how grutesk it was, and at times i had to close my eyes. The characters are believable as a family. VINESSA SHAW and DAN BYRD were standout in my eyes. They both had amazing roles. Vinessa Shaw's character Lynne seemed to be the glue that held the family together and wanted so much for everyone to be happy, and she loved her baby as any caring mother would. She also seemed to be the smartist and maybe strongest of the group. Dan played the teen boy role very well, i liked how he used the word ""random"" to explain the pig he saw, because I am a teenager and i use that word to describe just about everything. Any horror film will love this movie, it is A lot different from other horror films like house of wax and the Texas chainsaw massacre, because it is a family that is being torn apart, and everyone can relate to that, not random teenagers being stalked by ex boyfriends while blowing each other.

Good Remake,"The original ""Hills Have Eyes"" (1977) is often fondly remembered as a gruesome and disturbing film, when it actually isn't really. It was actually passed in Britain with comparatively few cuts for the time, and for a lot of British viewers was, for a long time, the only really 'horrific' horror movie available, however Alexandre Aja's remake makes up for that by including all the buckets of blood that audiences might have missed form the original.Sticking closely to the original storyline of an all-American family stranded in the desert and being attacked by depraved cannibal mutants, created from nuclear bomb testing decades earlier, the film nevertheless is far more intense than the original. Although it does suffer from the glossy look common to most modern horror films, instead of the bleak, rough low-budget appearance of the original.Another change is the added emphasis on the background of the attackers, which does add something of another dimension to the film, making them slightly more sympathetic.Worth watching for horror fans, and a must-see for fans of the original. This is a decent horror film, but ultimately nothing special.Contians swearing and graphic violence.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Good Remake,"I enjoyed the remake of Hills Have Eyes. I thought the acting was above average and enjoyed the way director Alexander Aja built the suspense in the film. I can't remember the original real well, but this movie was much better than some of the more recent horror films. I was way better than The Fog, and much better than Cursed, another Wes Craven film.The most surprising part about this movie was the acting. I actually felt sympathy for all the members of the family, and was glad to see them fight back against the mutants. I've actually grown sick of movies where the characters are simply put in a film only to be hacked to bits. However there are deaths of course, but I will not give any of that information away.I also enjoyed Alexander Aja's camera work in this film. I enjoyed the various angles he employed to make the film more disturbing. The movie also had a gritty quality about it, which only added to the films overall creepiness. In fact it kind of reminded me of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and The Hitcher. I never saw the remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre though.The plot of course is simple. A family is crossing the New Mexico desert on vacation and stops at a gas station where they get directions on how to get to California. The weird gas station attendant at first gives them the safe direction to go, but changes his mind when he discovers that maybe one of the members of the family has learn his little secret. We already know what that secret is when we are first introduced to this strange person. They follow the shortcut he gives them and mayhem en shews from there as they become stranded in the middle of nowhere. The vacationing family soon discovers that they are not alone and are being stalked by a murderous mutated family that lives in the hills surrounding them.Very effective film with many gruesome scenes, Hills Have Eyes is definitely a movie that horror movie buffs should enjoy. Its starts with some very violent scenes and then builds from there into one of the better horror movies to come around in a long while. It also gives us a back story about the mutated family which deals with the nuclear bomb testing that went on around the area and how the bomb testing is what caused the mutations, making them what they are today.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Raw and vicious done well.,"I like to think of myself as fan of all genres of movies. I also like to think that I know what the difference is between good and bad movies. This movie,""The Hills Have Eyes"",is a good film. I would like to iterate the fact that if your not a fan of this genre then your not going to enjoy it. this movie does horror well. It's really violent and gruesome with very tense moments. The movie plays close attention to detail especially in the gore and makeup effects and the setting and atmosphere also plays a large role. Unlike many movies in the same genre this movie is not cheesy and the acting is believable. with that said there are weak spots in the plot and some parts which are very predictable. But what Horror movie isn't like that? personally I believe thats what makes a horror movie.

You know the plot, if you've seen the original you know what's going to happen, but the twists and turns in the second half of the film make this essential viewing. The gore and violence is extreme BUT GODDAMMIT IT NEEDED TO BE! How long have we had to wait for a real nasty film of this nature.

They manage to find an isolated gas station nearby. the area in which their car breaks down was used by the U.S. Government for nuclear testing An area that was thought to be empty this means that they are stranded in the middle of nowhere. the family soon realise that they might actually be caught in a trap. which was set up by the inhabitants of the site who are out to start a gruesome massacre.

Could only watch 1hr of it, in fact 56min. couldn't even make it to the full hr. the beginning was pretty good on how it was set up but then like most if not all horror movies now a days get very bad. First the father is a retired cop. who all of a sudden sees a guy off him-self and hears a voice so starts shooting around. gets into a car without checking and ohh someone in the back seat. Then it just goes way down hill from there. girl gets rapped but no one sees her or hears anything inside the trailer where there is a few people sleeping. the mother even just wakes up ignors her getting rapped by 2 guys and walks out to see her husband burning which was tied on with ropes to the only tree in the desert which are special ropes that don't burn until the body is burned to a crisp.

Worthy Remake,"Having seen the original ""Hills Have Eyes"" and was bowled over by Alexander Aja's ""Haute Tension,"" I anticipated his take on this recent remake of a well know horror film. I have to say that Aja stayed true to the original but then built upon that further and made some improvements that worked. The effects were impressive, most notably, the mutant make up effects and the acting was better especially with the characters of Bobby and the son-in-law. The infamous trailer attack scene is much more brutal and shocking than the original. The only problem I had with the film was that it dragged in places much like the original had and the characters are never really sympathetic but rather a bunch of boorish, whiny people (with the exception of the older daughter and the dogs). Having watched the original, I knew who was going to die and I think this took away from the intensity but Aja did a wonderful job at recreating and updating the film for today's audiences.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Could have been brilliant but ends up as a slither- above-average horror,"I watched the original Wes Craven film a couple of nights before this remake and was overall disappointed. I won't go into a review but I have to say that it was clumsily but together and overall not scary or gory as it has been raved about so often.After several trailers, I was very much looking forward to this film, expecting plenty of frights and buckets of gore. The start of the film is predictable, a couple of people getting killed to establish to establish what the rest of the film is like. OK, so it's done well, and has a sinister and gory effect...but what does it accomplish that the audience doesn't already know? What would have been better is a proper and decent introduction to the family travelling through the desert.The film's pace, as well as introduction is also questionable, it seems to leap forwards at times but only to grind to an immediate halt...whether this is to try and force feed us some character driven moments. The film only really picks up pace when it seems the director is most comfortable, towards the climax.If you like your scares and gore, look no further. I can honestly say the film does have its jumpy moments and is indeed full of gore and some unpleasant moments...but these are far and few between. Between the moments of horror and gore, you really want certain members of the family to just get on with it and die...which shouldn't happen if the director wants his / her audience to sympathise with the characters.In conclusion, the film was worth-while experience...and whereas it fails to identify itself as a leading horror film, it certainly keeps itself above the likes of; ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (2004) and ""The Ring 2""....but if you want in my eyes what is the BETTER Wes Craven re-make...then look to ""Wrong Turn "" (2003)...which although technically isn't a remake, serves as a better reminder of the earlier Craven work than this film does.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
not a waste of time,"First of all i have to say that i did not see the original movie which released in 1977. A good reason that i did not try to see it is that i did not find this movie masterpiece. There are many mistakes on this film. First of all why to trust a miserable alcoholic man?Second mutants did not waste a time and kill some of the good guys to eat them but they bring alive the little baby to their village and they keep her alive.Third some mutants have problems with their body so they are disable but the same time they have and some super natural powers.FOURTH WHICH IS THE WORST: a little mutant girl is helping good guys to survive. So the other mutants did not learn her to eat people? If all the mutants around her even her parents are the ""bad guys"" how is it possible to be a ""good girl""?Anyway it was good film",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"If you like horrors, you should like this...","Let's face it. Most horror movies are pieces of garbage. Its rare when you run into a truly good horror movie. This movie does the job and then some. It sticks to the original perfectly, and the nuclear monsters are on a completely different level of scary (With a new backstory). Even though this movie had its share of corny moments, and seemed to drag on a bit too long... I loved it. I didn't expect an Academy winner here, and If you compare it to most of the crappy remakes that have been processed the past 5 years Id make it one of the best. Some of the acting was poor, but what do you expect in a horror movie? Soundtrack was also amazing. Highly recommend to any modern horror fan. Up there in my rankings as of late with The Ring and Dawn of The Dead. Best Remake in a long time.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
What are you people thinking,"I just went to see this film and all I can say is this was the worse film I have ever seen. For anyone with a hint of smarts this film is brain numbing. After the first ""kill"" scene, it takes for what seems for ever for the action to start. I wish I could add a spoiler in this review, but there is nothing to spoil. Just think of the most predictable scenes in a slasher film and there you go. Not only is this film painful to sit through, but it is even painful to write about. The acting is poor, the plot is thin, that is if there even is one, and the writing (and I love all of Wes Cravens works) is weak.

SCARY,"Before I begin, there are QUITE a few reviews on here containing spoilers, but without labeling them as such. If you don't want to read about the entire movie, do not read these reviews. Mine does not contain any spoilers.This movie went from 0-60 VERY quickly. I did not watch the original first, and I normally don't like remakes more than originals, particularly when Wes Craven is involved (love his work). But this was just WOW.I believe Wes Craven was involved in this...if only to help oversee and give input. Maybe that's why it's so fantastic. But I give credit where credit is due and Aja created one hell of a horror.The story is nothing to write home about, but the thrills and chills ARE. If you love horror...you WILL enjoy this. If horror movies scare you or you're not a horror buff...put your diapers on. For realI do NOT scare easily, and I don't even know if I was scared or just in a full state of ""OMG"" the entire time. But yeah...I was fully immersed and it was FUN. And I don't mean funny. No...uh uh.I can't quite remember but I believe I watched at least part of the original later on...and lemme tell ya...this remake is BETTER...for SURE.For fun and thrills I ought to give it a 10. I gave it a 9 simply bc it's not exactly Oscar material. Then again, what horror is?I'm not going to tell you any of it. All I can do is HIGHLY recommend this if you want a fun, shocking, edge-of-your-seat 2 hours.I'll admit, I was in-tune to who the hero or protagonist was early on...but near the end he/she is almost forgotten. I had a jump-outta-my-seat moment in which I realized 1/2 second prior and called out the hero's name in the nick of time (and then they appeared). I think it will surprise most people but in a very enjoyable way. Some people may think it's a certain someone. I FULLY believe it's their friend. (Sorry to be vague but I just cannot say more).Highly recommend this. I was very pleasantly surprised, and thoroughly enjoyed it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
creepy remake,"The horror genre has a tendency toward recycling ideas over and over, whether it be for the purposes of sequels, remakes, or franchise mergers. ""The Hills Have Eyes"" was a chiller written and directed by Wes Craven in 1977, and has now reappeared in the hands of ""High Tension"" director Alexandre Aja with the horror master's presumed approval, since he is credited here as producer. The basic premise remains intact from the original with a family's road trip hitting a dead end in the middle of a former nuclear test site. Much of the first half of the film unfolds with squirm inspiring tension, but once the pay-off arrives the quality of the film-making simply goes down. The unevenness this causes loses the film any possibility of being more than just a lazy, creepy, nonsensical shocker, which is a shame since the first hour suggests something more.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A great comedy/ a terrible horror,"This movie was Hilarious! I was gonna give it 6 or 7 stars because it was so funny , but then i remembered it was supposed to be a horror , and it was definitely not a scary film. Some people would probably be offended by the violence and gore in this movie , but it appealed to my sense of humour.Mainly because I kept in mind that it was not real , and also because it was so incredibly stupid and cheaply made. Especially when the guy from the goonies (Sloth) turns up on the scene and eats a budgie!! HILARIOUS!! But ultimately , the joke of this film began to wear thin , and i was pleased when it finished. This Movie is funny, cheap , silly , most likely offensive to some and should probably be considered a B movie.Not a good horror , but a good comedy for those with a dark sense of humour. Its unintentionally a bit like Tromas Toxic Avenger.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
dizzying suspense with the grittily satisfying payoff of bile-bubbling gore,"The Hills Have Eyesreviewed by Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.comrating: 2.5 out of 4Oh the humanity. Or lack thereof. In Alexandre Aja's remake of the 1977 Wes Craven mutant-fest, characters rip, shoot, tear, bite, axe, swing, kick, detonate, jump, and dismember each other to the bitter, very bloody end. Clearly reminiscent of Aja's last picture (the cult fave/box office sinker High Tension) The Hills Have Eyes has its sights, so to speak, directly on the same horror exploitation genre of the 1970's, where the make-up artist played as much a role as the director. And for the most part, Aja's style rings as true as it did with High Tension. But often Hills asks Aja to branch out into the realm of psychological horror; and here, Aja's direction stalls.A family of seven (a smaller family apparently wouldn't produce enough body bags) is well into a cross-country road trip, tugging a streamline trailer through the barren, hilly deserts of New Mexico. They're given a tip by a scruffy gas station attendee that there's a shortcut up the road; a shortcut that will cut hours off the trip. Lo and behold, the family's car is sabotaged eight miles into the desert and they're hunted by a band of mutant miners. No, the premise isn't rolling heads with its originality. But this is a remake, after all. And a Wes Craven remake at that. But before we discount the film, take into account that High Tension's premise was even less inventive, instead making great advantage of the plot's simplicity. And, for once, isn't it nice not to work out the mucky, ghost-girl-in-the-bathtub mystery we've rehashed a dozen times over by now with the recent tsunami wave of Japanese Psych. Horror?""Character Arc"" apparently isn't a term Aja has learned in his young film-making career. But its exclusion here is another refreshing breath amongst the continual spray of blood. His characters are plopped straight into the film fully constructed, not asked by the screenplay to develop and evolve throughout the film, but instead simply react to the situation. The method works to sidestep dialogue segments and long teary monologues that would otherwise slow the plot. Aja keeps the pace sprinting throughout, eager not to let his audience slouch in their seat in what would usually be a lull in the action for other, more conventional, horror films. The contradiction to this method, however, is that the screenplay asks for a lot of screen-time before the killing starts. Aja deals with these segments poorly, often depending on shadowy figures suddenly crossing frame to keep audiences twitchy. These tricks are cheap and without thrill. They rely on jump factor instead of true terror, letting Aja's trademark pacing stumble early on. They also make idiots out of the mutants. The things just look damned silly at times, chomping on the stump of a dog's leg and groaning like a sing-song caveman.But when the heads start rolling, The Hills Have Eyes finally shifts into gear. The first scene of terror (the first attack on the trailer) is a multi-layered set piece of gratuitous violence. It mixes bloody, horrible tragedy with white-knuckled, unsettling suspense. The scene screams at us with a bloody breath, shouting to us that no character is safe and that visceral is only a euphemism for what Aja intends to throw at us throughout. Alexandre Aja is, after all, the master of modern suspense. And from there the film continues strongly, stumbling only on the occasional silliness of the mutant characters and the laughably overwrought orchestral score. Aja sticks to his old tricks, mounting dizzying suspense with the grittily satisfying payoff of bile-bubbling gore. His thrills are a whirlwind of intensity, dropping us directly into the scenes of violence and giving them a reality that only heightens the cringe of the inevitable. And Aja spares us no gore. There are no cut-aways here. We see every shocking, bloody moment. But after films like Saw II and Hostel, we're a tad desensitized to such gore, calmly swirling and sipping our slurpees as fingers roll about on splintered floors.The Hills Have Eyes was the obvious progression for Alexandre Aja, stepping from cult indie hit to mainstream remake. But Hills isn't a sell-out film, as indie snobs are keen to point out. Aja keeps to his guns with style here. This is the same gritty director from High Tension, just with a worse script and some silly mutants hanging cross-eyed on his back.-www.samseescinema.com",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"One of the most brutal, disturbing horror movies that had the largest impact on me","Beautifully done. What constitutes a horror movie as ""effective?"" You get a few screams and laughs, people talk about it for a week then forget about it?No. The ones that last, the ones that leave a mark, a mark that is searingly PERMANENT, the ones that truly stick with you throughout the years, no matter what stage in life in which you are currently when you first view the film, THOSE are the ones that have the greatest effect. Jaws. Alien. The Exorcist. These movies are popular for a reason. One of the lesser known movies to be so effective, is the Hills Have Eyes remake of the Wes Craven classic.I could go on for pages about how brilliant this movie is. I'll do my best to keep it short.When I first saw it, it had recently came out on video, and I was still new to R rated features, but my childhood drew me to the horror genre, and with a morbid curiosity phase, I was instantly drawn to the aspect of this film.I bit off more than I could chew at the time.I almost couldn't finish it. Even today, I still have to fast-forward through a small part of the ""ambush"" scene. Sure, there are notorious horror movies more violent, gory, and merciless than this film (Martyrs, Cannibal Holocaust, A Serbian Film to name a few. Basically 20% of the films that Horrible Reviews on YouTube covers in his ""Most Disturbing Movies"" montage). But this one is special. It's so well done, the acting is flawless, special effects are superb, to the average viewer, it is a very difficult film to get through. At least through the ambush scene.After the scene that gets the ball rolling, it doesn't get any worse than that. But it's still hardcore and effective.Be warned before you watch it. It may be about two decades old by the time you read this (or even older), but it's still not for the feint of heart.I swear I've changed my rating of this film more than any other film. I started it out on a 3 or 4 because even though I recognized its genius and effectiveness, I hated the movie for how it made me feel. I lost sleep over it. I saw things I've never seen on film before. I wasn't desensitized yet in the least, so I was susceptible to its horrific influences. I changed it to a 5 or 6 years later because I became more used to the content and was more lenient. I changed it yet again a bit higher later on, and just now I changed it to an 8 as I started this review, and then a 9 at the time I'm writing this sentence. I may even change it to a 10/10 eventually.I would keep going, but I won't, sorry I went so long already.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Freakiest movie I have ever seen...,"OK, so I am pregnant and me and my family are really close. So, if some weird ass mutant was raping my sister and sucking on me while there is a humongous gun on my babies head. Someone was going to leave that trailer without a mutated penis and his mouth was already screwed up but, that wouldn't stop me from tearing his teeth out. Honestly, if he was going to go any farther I was ready to walk out. I couldn't stand watching that. My fianc√© had no blood in his hand at the end of the night.It is one of those movies where you can't figure out what is going on and what is going to happen next. I didn't think at all for a second that the ""pussy"" Doug? was it? would save the day. And I really hope that they get outa that desert alive and I hope they have something for that baby to eat while they are walking out of there. Otherwise, they are screwed.This movie was great other than that. It scared the crap outa me and I would see it again.

Alexandre Aja equals Walking Scum,"This guy is a horrible director with absolutely zero talent, and yet he manages to become flavor of the second in the ever fickle horror film industry. First off what makes it so sad aside from this grotesque morbid and despicable poor excuse for a horror film with no real suspense whatsover and instead has rape and a family slaughtered which is a totally deplorable concept in itself to make a film centered around. It's the fact there are so many amazingly talented writer/directors out there who's projects out there never see the light of day and they have universes more talent than this piece of garbage has in his pinky finger. I think certain film execs should be arrested and put in jail for their assault on humanity with deplorable films like this with no redeeming value whatsoever. It just gives already sick and mentally unbalanced people something to get turned on by. And this guy thinks he so cutting edge? His head should be on a plate.

Very Intense!,"Back in the 1970's, there was a movie with the same title. Now they have the same movie, same title, different type of intensity. ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is a movie that will leave you on the edge of your seat. A family going to California for vacation would have to take the scenic route. Who would know it would end up being a tourist trap? No one when some spike strips used in highway pursuits would totally disable the family SUV. In the original version the vehicle was a station wagon. That there's an upgrade. That one has a history. A history anyone would should forget. Mutant outcasts spreading terror after a nuclear blast years ago. Man, these people got a serious grudge. Not only did they take out the father, mother, in-law, and brutally assaulting the sister, it's up to the men of the group to fight back. Doug, who hated guns puts his ideologies behind him fast to get his daughter back from those fiendish beings. However, only one of them mutants was helpful with the victims, and rebelled against them. That freakish one with the strength and ax was a challenge. And the brother of the sister was mad enough to avenge the death of his dog. Very bloody, and very intensifying, ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is a keeper. So either way you go, 1977 or 2006, it very scary and not for the weak! Rating 3 out of 5 stars!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

I haven't seen a movie ever with such vulnerable, wholesome victims. Overall, I guess I would say that the movie was effective in suspense and horror, but I was shocked and disturbed by the victims they chose to die. The ending was very depressing, but I can see why it was done that way. This was worth watching, but left me with nightmares for a few days.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Very good remake, lots of blood and gore!!!","The hills have eyes (2006) was an enjoyable experience, a better than expected remake of a horror classic, i wasn't a massive fan of the original and found this remake to be much better.The film is about a family who are travelling to California but on their way they get sent down this deserted lane in the desert to save on travelling time, but little do this family know that their detour will turn into a trip to hell.A bunch of freaks who love to torture and kill ""normal"" civilians are watching the family from the desert hills and it's not long before the family are fighting for their lives against the evil freaks!!! I'm a big fan of horror films and this movie held my interest, it's creepy at times and there's some strong gore and very disturbing moments, there's lots of blood too, so if your a fan of horror movies then you'll be entertained by this film.In the day and age where us horror fans are over-fed crap remakes such as ""The Fog"" ""The Omen"" and ""Black Christmas"" etc etc or just general crap teen-slasher horrors!!!

Finally a decent one.,"A family decides to take a vacation to California. After stopping at a run down gas station and taking directions from a seemingly less than trustworthy individual, their innocent little family outing turns into a living hell. I think everyone has been waiting for a good horror film, in spite of the recent lack luster ones that have came out this year. Having never seen the original ""The Hills Have Eyes"" I couldn't tell you which one is better. This one definitely exceeded my expectations. I had an opportunity to see this at an advanced screening. It starts of a little on the slow side. Some of the characters are just strait up annoying starting off, so be prepared to be wishing death on some of them. When the action starts, it hits hard. You will find yourself pitying this poor family. The acting wasn't that bad surprisingly. If you are a fan of gore this movie offers some pretty good scenes. Nothing outstanding though. The suspense was a little mediocre. You have your typical ""boo"" type scares. You can see most of them coming. This movie's strength is in the situation this family is in. They start off not getting along very well, but after loosing some of their own they have to learn to get along as a family and fight for survival. I'll give the family dog kudos. You'll see what I mean.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
An Entertaining Remake For Sure.,"We all know how bad remakes can be, especially in the horror genre, but that's certainly not the case here. In fact, I like the 2006 version BETTER. This was terrific I thought, coming from French director Alexandra Aja who's first film ""High Tension"" was a highly disturbing masterpiece. This movie isn't really scary (except one specific jump-out moment that I distinctly recall). It's mostly about how sick these mutants are. The key to the movie was the drama and the edge-of-the-seat suspense, which grabbed you by the throat the whole way through. This movie also has one of my favorite fight scenes of any recent horror film. I would definitely recommend this movie to fans of the genre, as long as you have a strong stomach. This movie makes the desert hills much more creepy and unsettling. And again, it's not very scary as you're watching it, but if you ever end up stranded on a deserted back road out in the desert, you'll be ten times more scared than you would've been after seeing The Hills Have Eyes.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best horror movie remakes,"Just got done watching the 2006 remake of The Hill Have Eyes from writer-director Alexandre Aja and it was even better than the original. This is the movie that fully established this man as someone for horror fans to keep their eye on.Positives for The Hill Have Eyes (2006):
First off, this movie has a bigger budget than the original and Alexandre Aja takes full advantage of that budget to phenomenal success. I loved Aaron Stanford as Doug Bukowski and he is one of the best and most underrated horror movie protagonist I've ever seen and it pains me that no one ever talks about this guy. I appreciate that this movie makes the mountain cannibal a lot more terrifying and animalistic then the original. I love that the German Shepherd Beast is allowed to be more badass as he kills two of the mountain cannibals in this movie. And finally, the gore and kills from Greg Nicotero are absolutely phenomenal.Overall, The Hills Have Eyes (2006) is a perfect example of how to do a remake properly and it's even better than the original from Wes Craven.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
an OK movie but it could have been better,"I dislike the nowadays and boisterous remakes of classic horror movies as much as the next person but, ever since the news came that an update of ""The Hills Have Eyes"" was in talks, I had great expectations towards it. There are reasons for this rather enthusiast anticipation, actually. Unlike ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""The Fog"", to name just two examples, Wes Craven's original 1977 screenplay was open for improvement AND Alexandre Aja would be just the right man for the job, as his own project ""Haute Tension"" is definitely one of the best horror films since the year 2000. That particular film wasn't really a masterpiece of plotting, but it was genuinely grim and barbaric and those are exactly the qualities a film like ""The Hills Have Eyes"" require as well. The new screenplay follows Craven's original fairly strict, except that the eyes in the hills aren't of members of an inbred family anymore but of an entire community of horribly mutated ghouls. Deep in the New Mexican deserts, a small village of coal miners once refused to leave the area at the time the American government decided to test nuclear weapons there, and now they still prowl the wasteland, assaulting travelers that dare to leave the main highways. The Carter family is next on the menu, and the mutants really don't care whether the victims are females, elderly folks or even newborn babies...",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Amazing remake,"Just to start the original The Hills Have Eyes is so great but the remake brings so much more to the table.

The makeups, special effects, and gore are off the wall awesome. The connection between characters feels much deeper. The intensity is turned up to 11.

I know I know it's a remake but the plot followed so closely that it seemed to take away the shock value of the special gore effects. The gore was good when it was there but still was not what I was expecting. Out of the 3 recent horror movies that I have seen at the theater I would have to rank them: 1. Hostel 2. Final destination 3 3. Hills have eyes as far as the gore factor, don't get me wrong the acting and story line in this movie is far superior to FD3 but FD3 had more astounding kill scenes!

Unfortunately part of the effect comes from a terribly cheap and irresponsible tactic. It is something that I found no reviews mentioned, and something which I feel people should know. There is a rape sequence at one point in the film which last far too long and is far too tastelessly done to really get any reaction other than trauma out of the audience. From that point on the theater was silent after watching it. I went to see it with someone who was sensitive to that sort of content and it just was not a pleasant experience.

"Brutal, Intense and Unsettling Remake that respects the original","'The Hills Have Eyes' is one of the most intense, visceral and unsettling horror remakes out there that not only pays respect to Wes Craven's 1977 original vision yet expands upon it in the right places and even manages to outdo it in some areas such as scope and execution. What let's this version down slightly was the pacing issues and the forgettable characters, but other than that this one hell of a horror movie with plenty of gore and carnage to keep you more than entertained throughout.The Plot = 'Big' Bob Carter (Ted Levine) and his wife Ethel (Kathleen Quinlan) are heading west to celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary. Joining them are their teenage kids Bobby (Dan Byrd) and Brenda (Emilie De Ravin), as well as their eldest daughter Lynn (Vinessa Shaw), her husband Doug (Aaron Stanford) and their newborn baby Catherine. While travelling they get into an accident leaving them stranded and falls prey to a group of mutated cannibals.This is a solid and sometimes innovative adaptation that pays respect to the original by keeping the same basic story and expanding it on a much bigger scope and direction and differs just enough for it to stand out on its own. What also helps is the stellar direction by Alexandre Aja who takes a risky approach with the material by injecting more extreme violence and brutality into the production, while at the same time still delivering the scares and suspense the original had without watering anything down. This movie has a cool European flavour to it and while it's slow to start with, once it gets going it's brutal, disturbing and relentless and that's what makes it so fun.The movie changes the villain's motivations from the original by having them as mutated cannibals instead of an inbred hillbilly family living out in the desert was an interesting choice and gives the movie an element of social commentary, but to me they weren't as frightening or as interesting as their counterparts, but I do admire the filmmaker's efforts.The cast here were fantastic despite being one dimensionally written they still manages to shine in their roles. Ted Levine is great as the head of the family Big Bob, Kathleen Quinlan gives a strong and likeable performance as the wife. Dan Byrd and Aaron Stanford each gives perhaps the movie's strongest performances and Emile De Ravin and Vinessa Shaw were also good in their respective roles.Overall 'The Hills Have Eyes' doesn't quite outshine the classic original in my opinion, but nonetheless it's a good solid effort and certainly better than most of the horror remakes that came out during the 2000's.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

More meat for the grinder,"The Carter family is traveling across the New Mexico desert on their way to San Diego. On an isolated road, their vehicles run across tire spikes. They don't notice at first, but they have fallen into a trap. They are hunted by a group of cannibalistic society warped by nuclear testing in the area. This is a remake of 1977 Wes Craven horror. The ultra ugly violence is pretty interesting. It's meant to shock and it does that to some extent. It certainly gets very brutal.The actors are pretty good but the characters are unoriginal. They are certainly better than this B-movie material deserves. The problem is that I didn't really root for the family. Neither did I root against the family. So the tension of their kills aren't maximized. They're just meat for the grinder.I wish Alexandre Aja could concentrate on one character and make me root for that person. These people are not worthy of my sympathy. They do stupid things like splitting up. The father runs away when he should be attacking like when his dog bites the ax guy. The boy is useless. He's probably the only guy with a gun in the world that is the underdog in a fight with an unarmed guy. It make me want to slap him.... BADLY. And somebody needs to shut Emilie de Ravin up. Sometimes, you can scream too much in a horror movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
I would say this is a hair below the original but very close to as good (the first time I saw this I thought it was better than the original),"The Hills Have Eye (2006) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently watched on Tubi. The storyline follows a group traveling across the Midwest on their way to California when they decide to take a shortcut across some lands deserted due to military testing. When they breakdown in the middle of the desert they'll need to look for help, unfortunately for them some people have found creative ways to survive in the desert and the stranded group may be their next meal.This movie is directed by Alexandre Aja (High Tension) and stars Ted Levine (Silence of the Lambs), Kathleen Quinlan (The Doors), Dan Byrd (Easy A), Emilie de Ravin (Brick) and Billy Drago (The Untouchable).The opening sequence with the scientists was a great way to start the movie. The makeup, gore and special effects were perfect. The meat locker scene in this was very creative and the movie is a 10/10 at the end starting with the line ""it's breakfast time"" then the movie takes off like a bullet. I did like they brought back the use of dogs in this remake but it wasn't as good as the first film. The settings, much like the first film, are well established. I did love moving the family in the hills from the caves to a more societal appearance. The cast for this horror gem was perfectly selected and I loved seeing Levine as the overbearing dad.Overall I would say this is a hair below the original but very close to as good (the first time I saw this I thought it was better than the original). There were so many elements I liked. I would score this film a 8.5/10 and strongly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"This is one cool, gory movie","This movie has absolutely brilliant, as soon as it came on i was glued to the screen, the opening credits were rather, urm, tasteful, showing different tests of nuclear weapons, then what I'm assuming is the results of these tests, mutated baby foetus' and other people alike. The instant gore of a man swinging a pick axe through the back of some sort of scientist is just the start, the pick axe makes plenty of other appearances throughout the film. The story of how the people become stranded in the desert is the same as all other horror flicks, they mutants have a friend who agrees to bring them food if they'll bring him the victims' merchandise. There are some disturbing scenes in the film though that were almost too real at one point, mainly when the mutants first turn up at the caravan, enter huge amounts of disgust as we see people burning at the stake, shootings to the head, breast feeding(not to the baby, sick.) and other disgusting shows from the villains. I was glad that the film didn't result in the same fashion as wrong turn and other recent horror films where the attackers cannot, will not be killed. All in all it was an entertaining film, if not for the horror and violence that pursues throughout, but for the different mutations that occurred to the once normal people of the town, disturbing or hilarious, I'll let you decide.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the better horror movies,"I just watched this movie early to day and I think this is one of the better horror movies of the past few years. I didn't find the movie too scary but it was suspenseful at times and very gruesome. It started out intense at the opening but then things calmed down as the character background was being developed. As soon as the mutants ca.me out, the intensity picked up and although things were predictable at times, there was also a lot of suspenseful moments. I enjoyed this a lot more than any other remakes. Dawn of the Dead was good but I think this was more original in the direction it took. I would recommend this to fans of a lot of blood and gore cause its not really scary but I don't really know of any horror movies that are scary anymore. If you have a weak stomach, don't watch this but if your a fiend of gratuitous violence, then check this one out",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Technically brilliant...but morally unsound,"I have to say i'm an avid horror fan, i think horror movies are fascinating in the way they satisfy the senses that audiences are unable to admit to. Human beings are fascinated by violence, and not just anyone, all humans, it is in our nature to be violent.The Hills have eye's is the remake of the relatively unknown 70's cult horror film by Wes Craven. The remake has all the ingredients of a great horror film, superb performances, great cinematography, great music. Now tell me what element is missing from that list?I had already heard beforehand of the films graphic content, and had prepared myself for the absolute worst, Cinema is an experience to be had, Jumping into controversial material is a great joy personally.One scene and one scene only spoils this film for me, the rape scene, it is despicable. In fact the whole trailer scene, the first attack, is most awful. It crosses the line. The film is not all that original, and i wasn't having fun while watching the film, i found it to be verging on sadist porn. The final half hour though i thrilling, but it is out weighed to the down points.Recommendation: Well.....Not recommended",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
lol,"My first reaction after this movie was...l m a o ""Holy Sh*t!"" Not because I am disgusting and found it humorous, but because I was so dumbstruck at the entire thing, it was definitely a ""holy f*ck"" moment. I haven't ever seen that much blood and gore in a mainstream horror movie before. It was so freaking cool. I was expecting lots of gore when I watched it, and what I got was way beyond my expectations, I was one happy gore-phile after that one. But the thing is, it's actually a good movie, the story is clich√© but it's alright, the acting isn't great but it does the job. It is an average movie that I would normally give a movie like this a 7, but the violence and the tension definitely boosted the rating, because it adds so much to the movie and makes it so much more effective. If you love gore, than you and your fellow gore loving friends need to watch this with Large bags of popcorn for each of you. I guarantee it will have you sharing a round of high fives afterward.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best gruesome scary films I've ever seen!,"I was told this film would be so gory that it would actually make you vomit. Id have to say it never made me physically vomit but it sure was terrifying. I did actually think it would be scarier than what it was, as i was told by other people that its extremely frightening, but it was still pretty disturbing. Id have to say it was without doubt more gruesome than scary. Some of the scenes in the film were extremely shocking and horrific it was almost upsetting and one of the scenes was even a bit of a tear jerker. I thought the story line was excellent as I don't think I've ever seen a scary film quite like it, but I didn't realise this was a remake. After seeing this i will definitely check out the other version of the film to see if its any better or even worse. Id definitely recommend this film to anyone who likes a good spine chilling scary movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Would have been bad 30 years ago,"As someone who's old enough to remember the video nasties of the late 1970s and early 1980s, I had the hope that the horror genre has moved on. These days, I figured, an intelligent audience want some thought in their slasher flick as well as the obligatory gratuitous violence. Sadly after watching this loose remake of Craven's classic I realise I was misguided. This sort of movie was done better 30 years ago with no CGI and a fraction of the budget.The plot premise is actually very good. The execution (no pun intended) is dire at best. I don't think it's necessarily the director's fault: the script could have been written better by an 8 year old. Shallow characters, ridiculous situations, a ploy holier than the Turin shroud, and just plain stupid lines (Brenda's ""Let's get out of here"" towards the end takes the gold here - you'll see what I mean). Save yourself 1hr 40min and avoid this one like an atomic bomb test area.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Reminded me of what a horror is supposed to be like,"I didn't go into watching this film with high hopes. Hearing that it was a remake of an old Wes Craven slasher furthered my skepticism. The only real reason I bothered was because a) my girlfriend had broken up with me and I needed something to distract me and b) its got Emilie De Ravin in it who in my opinion is extremely cute.The last movie that truly scared me was Aliens which I saw when I was twelve, since then all horrors I've seen have been little more than gore feasted stalker movies. The Hills Have Eyes changed all that. It opens with a nice gory scene of scientists getting impaled with pitch forks, the brutality caught my attention. Things slow right down as the film introduces the Carter family taking the scenic route through the desert to San Diego. ""Yay there's Emilie!"" says the slightly interested me.Then things get a bit worse, their truck and caravan gets sabotaged by road spikes. Okay, now I'm watching. Whilst the 1st 30mins is a bit slow, it did something that other horrors don't do: character development. When the s#!* hit the fan (and it does horribly), I wasn't laughing like I generally do. I was genuinely shocked and felt sorry for the characters.The violence is extremely explicit in this movie, no holds barred and it was for once genuinely disturbing. This movie has restored my nervous approach to horrors and also on a side note confirmed that Emilie only does good movies ^_^",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than I expected,"Let me be clear about one thing: This is not a good film. The narrative is sorely lacking in places, the dialogue is nothing special, and in some parts the acting is almost painful to watch. In too many cases the director attempts to cover up bad writing with disgusting and disturbing special effects - a sad trend in today's horror cinema. And speaking of horror, outside of those special effects, very little in this movie is actually scaring. There are no ominous moments, nothing to psychologically shake the viewer, and what few genuine scares the film does contain are all pretty much ruined by the all-too-obvious accompanying music cues.That said, if you watch this as something other than a horror film, it can actually be fairly entertaining. This is more along the lines of something like Evil Dead 2, Planet Terror, or Army of Darkness - each of which has about the same amount of realism as The Hills Have Eyes. This movie features a mixture of comedy and action similar to the previously mentioned movies. The violence gets quite comical at parts, and the fight sequences are pretty well-coordinated. While THHE lack's the clever catchphrases that make Ash so popular, it does manage to maintain one's interest throughout the movie. In fact, if the creators had spent more time molding the movie into something like Army of Darkness, this would probably have turned out to be a much better film. Unfortunately, it suffers from attempts to keep it in the horror genre, and the makers do not have enough imagination to make that concept work here. As an action-thriller-comedy, however, it's worth a rental.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Utter garbage!,"I cant find words to describe how pathetic this film was. I sat down to watch it fully prepared for the torrent of gore and violence but when will these Zombified film makers realise that on its own, blood and guts doesn't make an enjoyable cinematic ride. It has to ""WORK"".In the movies you can chop a person into a thousand pieces with an axe but if the viewer doesn't give a flying **** about the characters, they might as well be hacking away on a rare joint of beef.In short, the characters were so incredibly stupid and annoying you started to side with the mutated miners before long! And don't even get me started on the concept of nuclear radiation turning these people into flesh eating superhuman cannibals that can survive for 50 years in a derelict nuclear test site in the desert. Surely with no water supply.Above all this, what really concerns me is that there are people on this planet that thought it ""Rocked"". ROFL. Surely these kids got in with fake ID??

"same old story, but still fairly thrilling","I'm a little tired of the ""Texas Chainsaw"" template playing out ad nauseum. You know the story...wayward travelers end up stopping at a gas station, receiving misdirection from some creepy individual tied to a murderous clan, then end up victims of said clan. That's the biggest negative about this movie: it's old hat (except for a particularly upsetting mid-section). Acting by Shaw and Quinlan and the cast is solid, probably more likable and naturalistic than it needed to be. The direction is strong, the photography fantastic...it's a transporting film...there's just something a little uneven in the tone. Realistic humans, cartoonish villains...I think the Texas Chainsaw remake did this one better.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
better than the original,"here's the odd remake that far surpasses the original. while craven's 1977 flick does sustain a raw & gritty queasiness (a result of a good, archetypal horror premise mixed with a willingness to take things too far mixed with no budget), the execution is lacking, the premise is under-explored, and the campier and cruder aspects eventually overwhelm the whole affair. the re-make, though, attains an even higher level of tension and horror. a sense of hopelessness pervades the entire nightmare, the gore is more gruesome and believable, and the terror is more unrelenting. and like 'godzilla' or 'night of the living dead', the socio-political underpinnings keep the movie from becoming just another run-of-the-mill genre pic.(on the opposite end of the spectrum from the omen remake. that was bad. just bad.)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The hills have eyes and the producers too: excellent popcorn horror,"When you decide to watch a movie like this updated version of ""The hills have eyes"" you are not looking for a Hitchcock nor a Kubrick. Not even an Oscar nominee. What you really want is a couple of hours of good plain entertainment, with some smart suspense, a minimally coherent plot, and a good production that should translate in a clear direction, good photography and adequate sound (yes, sound, the main element in the ""boo-factor"", you know, those moments when the people jump from their seats and screams pop up around the theater).Well, this movie has all of the above. It provides the kind of entertainment you expect without being too explicit except in what refers to human or mutant butchery that nowadays seems to be a must for the genre. Nevertheless these scenes are very well achieved, rounding an excellent work in cinematography by Belgium Maxime Alexandre, under an overall good direction over his own screenplay by Frenchman Alexandre Aja.For my surprise this movie does not make use of the usual resource of the hot chicks nor hot guys. Actually there is nothing close to the hot guy stereotype, but even though there is good hot chick material in American Vinessa Shaw (a Kubrick-chick if you remember ""Eyes Wide Shut"") and Australian Emilie de Ravin (your lovely Claire Littleton in ""Lost"") playing as sisters, there is basically no explicit use of her sensuality, even less of her natural body attributes. There are two scenes than run together where one after other sister are under some kind of perverse sexual harassment where almost everything is left to you to complete with your own dirty mind.Again, be aware that this is a good movie form the absolute light entertainment point of few. Don't think not even for a second it's perfect. The plot is full of holes, some impossible stuff happens, but what the hack, the whole idea is just a big impossibility, this is not a documentary or anything like that. So be smart, lower your criticism, help yourself with a drink, a good dosage of sugar or whichever substance makes your mood go smooth, relax and have fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
not bad,"I love the original film. Michael Berryman was a scary guy and he to me is Hills Have Eyes. hen i heard they were doing a new one i couldn't wait to see it at the cinema. It was a slow start, too many scenes of the desert and the mines. Also too much on the nuclear testing years before, i don't' recall much on that in the original but i suppose all re makes change a few bits of the film. The Cannabals weren't quite as scary and a bit shocking to see the young children towards the end of the film. What happened to them? The rape scene isn't as bad as some have said and has kept to the original script again. What started as a slow film got really gory and quite jumpy. A few bits were a bit unbelievable, the Hero Dad rescuing his daughter after so many beatings...even though he had been portrayed as a bit of a wimp. I love horror films and love to be scared but too many films use killings/violence as a a way to scare you, to me the unknown and the not knowing what is going to happen next is scarier. All in all for someone who hasn't seen the first one then they will probably enjoy it but i would suggest watching the first one too.

Gotta say Hills Have Eyes was pretty average.,"Just expressing that this film wasn't necessarily a bad film like The Fog or anything, but not exactly up to Saw 2 standard.

Completely missed the point of the film: it lacked a good story (like most horror films); good killings; and a unique ending.That reminds me... Wrong Turn... go see that instead - basically the same film entirely, but much more fun, gory and intense.

Only For Those Who Appreciate Great Horror Film-making!,"I do not know how good the replay value of this movie will have yet, since I only watched it in the theater once... But there was a lot to admire about the director's skill in making this film. It really grabs a hold of the audience and those unprepared for what ""true horror suspense"" really is, will leave the theater by the frighteningly despicable ""trailer scene"".The reason I gave this movie a 9 out of 10 is because the ""hero"" character that arises from the family to deal revenge in the 3rd act, is not the character I would have chosen. I probably would have made the son character a touch older and made him the hero... If only because I believe the kid could fire a shotgun sooner than the liberal cell phone salesman. Also, oddly the father and son characters should have handled there firearms with more skill then running and firing at random like idiots. Meanwhile, the cell phone salesman, who never fired a gun before, seems to handle a shotgun with ease by the finale. Minor quibble.. in an otherwise uber-suspenseful and satisfying horror film.This falls more in the category of the revenge horror flick. Cause I could understand why people leaving at the trailer scene, would be disgusted by the film. You didn't stick around long enough to see the monsters get what they deserve.One bad review from someone that did leave at the trailer scene kinda baffles me, so I had to quote it here.LITTLE_WACHO, from Canada says: ""This movie lacks any integrity. Please, don't waste your money or time to go see this movie. You can't even laugh at the crimes being committed. They're not funny or entertaining. They create a feeling of uneasiness in the pit of your stomach. This movie is a waste of money not only for those who see it, but for the idiots who made it. There's a line when it comes to horror films, and they left it way behind them with this film.""First of all, why would you want to laugh at a rape scene? The director didn't play ""Benny Hill"" music with the family members running back and forth from the rape scene in the trailer to the father being burnt alive outside. He made it hard to stomach and edge of your seat suspenseful for a reason...That ""uneasy feeling in the pit of your stomach""... that's called a good HORROR movie. People that don't like to ride rollercoasters, usually don't like that sinking feeling in there stomachs. Which is fine... The reviewer should just admit they don't like horror films... not bash a well-made one.Personally, I agree that the ""trailer scene"" is hard to watch... And that makes the revenge on the ""monsters"" by the second half that much more satisfying. It's not a brilliant thought- provoking film people... It's just a well-made horror film.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A good, solid horror flick with plenty of guts and gore to spare.","Without a doubt, solid (albeit gory) entertainment. Most of the films that I've seen were kinda lame. Saw 1 and 2 was okay but none of them had the intensity and blood-soaked carnage as this (with the exception of ""Hostel"" which IS far more sicker and gruesome than THHE). The direction and cinematography is BEAUTIFUL; the arid, endless desert is a wonderful setting for this horror film. My only gripe with this film is that there's very little character development. I wanted to know more about the mutants and their inner workings as well as more interaction. It may slow the film down, but a little more development wouldn't hurt. I would advise parents not to take the younglins along for this one but I was shocked to discover a group of 8 year olds on a field trip watching this film in the theater. I fear the worst for them come bedtime.The Hills Have Eyes is a solid gore fest for those with a taste for the gory details.

Aja tones down for American remake,"Yeah, this film's first 45 minutes are a bore. I think Aja tried to introduce the audience to the characters and the mood of the film the same way some flicks from the seventies (TCM, Dawn of the Dead, the original Hills Have Eyes, I Spit on your Grave) did, but in this case it really drags and feels like an empty attempt. If you loved Aja's Haute Tension, I think you will be expecting the same realistic impact from the violence, but don't be fooled, THHE doesn't feature anything like that. It's gorier, but the tone of the violence is your typical American tone, instead of the European wild-and-insane- as-hell violence present in Haute Tension. So this movie seems more like that¬Ö a movie. One of the things that really made an impact on the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, was the way it was filmed. Like a documentary. Haute Tension had a small dose of that, and it worked, but this one is filmed in such a neat way it feels artificial. Don't get me wrong. There's plenty of violence, but I wasn't really moved by it. The miners look good, but not particularly disturbing. If you have seen Chris Cunningham's 'Rubber Johnny', you'll find nothing disturbing about THHE's mutants ¬ñthere's one that resembles Rubber Johnny too much. The death's aren't that violent either. They are pretty repetitive. After everything I read here, I was expecting something with more impact.You will have fun. But that's as far as it goes.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tries hard,"Aja had a really wonderful scary film before he did this (although his previous project had one major flaw, at least that's what I think, but more on that subject on that films IMDb site later), so they gave him this project. A remake of a Wes Craven horror flick from the 70s, that is considered a classic. Sounds like he had to lose everything, but couldn't gain anything? So why did he do the remake then after all that?Because he tried to bring it to the new millennium and changed a few things. Some of the changes are good, others aren't. One of the changes is the back story of the ... let's call them bad guys, another the dynamic in the family (main characters). All in all good things, but if you have seen the original, you can't shake the feeling off, that something is missing or that this isn't original enough (that's how I felt), plus there are characters (the guy at the gas station), who just didn't make sense at all ...

The hills have side show freaks,"""The Hills Have Eyes"" wasn't that bad of a movie, but it wasn't that good either. I only saw a couple of brief trailers before seeing the movie so I wasn't exactly sure what I was going to be watching. The only thing I really expected was some type of suspense or fright factor based upon the trailers I saw.The movie was about a town of miners and their families that were horribly disfigured because of living near a government nuclear test site. During the movie you come to know that the reason these side show freaks are so hideous and venomous is due to their idiotic decision to stay in a town near a government test site though they were given ample warning to leave. That little tidbit of information helps the story a little bit, but not much.The movie does give you a rooting interest in the family that is being preyed upon. They are a typical vacationing American family totally undeserving of being victimized AND... they have a baby. Of course the movie is very graphic as well just to get you to cringe. If you are looking for a movie to be startled and disturbed by, then ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is the movie for you. I was expecting a bit more of a story without the heavy reliance on blood and violence, hence this movie didn't quite suit my taste.

The movie really starts to get exciting when the remaining stranded family begins to defend themselves and seek revenge on the mutants that surround them.

The most intense horror film in years,"Yes sire, we have a winner here folks! The Hills Have Eyes is the best horror remake since 2004's Dawn of the Dead, and I doubt you'll see a better horror flick all year long. It's brutal, gory and insanely intense; a really well done, fleshed out nightmare, that pulls no punches and takes no prisoners. The movie is a remake of a Wes Craven film from the 70's about a family driving through the New Mexico desert on a cross country road trip when their truck is wrecked and they are left stranded in the middle of nowhere. Their cell phones are out of range to pick up any signals, and their truck is smashed up beyond any kind of repair. Their options are limited, and none of them are good. As it turns out the part of the desert they happen to be in was once a nuclear testing ground used by the government. A group of miners were ordered to leave their homes and seek refugee from the nuclear fallout, but they didn't leave, and in turn were left deformed, mutated and extremely deranged.I've always found that the best horror films are the ones that really allow you to care and sympathize with the characters, because being able to put your heart into the characters really is what keeps you on the edge of your seat, and most horror movies do a poor or terrible job at doing that. It's only once you're emotionally invested in the people that you can really root for them and hope that they all make it out alive in the end. If not, then your just watching people who you don't care for getting endlessly slaughtered, and it's not engaging or interesting as a movie going experience. The Hills Have Eyes does manage to do this, and does it quite well. We spend the first twenty or thirty minutes learning about this seemingly average American family on what would seem like a completely normal road trip. I was actually quite surprised at how much time the film burns just allowing us to grow closer to this family before plunging them head first into a hellishly intense nightmare in the middle of nowhere. Once we've become attached to these characters it hurts us to see them in such jeopardy or even killed off, but that's the reality of the film; it's survival of the fittest in the grittiest of ways.The first scene in which the family is terrorized by the mutants from the hills is quite a tremendously disturbing scene. So much so that I did notice several people get up and walkout, so this movie clearly isn't for everyone. The scene in which two of the mutants torment the women of the family in the trailer is pretty sick, and is made only more horrifying because there's also a little baby, whose life is also in jeopardy. It's a risky scene, very real, but also very risky. Once the sequence is over you're left shocked, repulsed and immediately you hate these mutants, and you can't wait until these guys get it in the end. The mutants in the film are monstrously primitive and relentless, and it helps that they're also cannibals, which puts them over the top on the creepy scale.You watch this normal average everyday American family being victimized and tormented and then there's the aftermath; what are they gonna do about it? The mutants have killed members of their family (including one of their dogs) and have kidnapped their baby. From this point on the entire film is in straight up smackdown, in-your-face horror splatter mode, with plenty of nasty gore, slow, but gradual building suspense and a wickedly vicious score filled with raging guitars. The remaining members of this poor family aren't just gonna sit back and let themselves be terrorized again; they take action, holding down the fort (which in this case is the family trailer), and go after these freaks, kicking ass and taking names. Heck, even the family's dog kicks a little mutant ass! At that point you'll be screaming ""Hell yeah!"" The Hills Have Eyes is an intense horror film; shocking, horrifying, gory, and unpredictable. It just might be too much for some people, but for hardcore horror fans, THIS is the film you've been waiting for, and it certainly delivers the goods! It's an unapologetic exercise in visceral horror, so raw it just might fry your nerves.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disappointed?,"I have just watched this film and am so surprised by the IMDb responses to this film I felt compelled to register to post my first review.Firstly I bought Wes Cravens 2 Hills Have Eyes films and the two remakes at the same time, so I don't feel I am too biased in any way as I have only seen each film once (bar the modern sequel). But I watched the original film first (about 9 months ago) and thought it was great. Very thrilling and had me on the edge of my seat for the majority of the film. I loved it. I then watched it's sequel about 6 months ago which I am sure everybody agrees is awful.Now having watched this film I am disappointed with it but was shocked to see the majority of people on here not only enjoyed it but preferred it to the original. I completely understand that the film is the same story on a bigger budget with better production standards and more gore. But I felt that the film lacked the character of the original, it was competent enough sure, but even with the increased gore (and there was a lot) it did little for me.Maybe it is because I watched the first film first so you may think I am probably biased but for me the film lacked the feeling of the original. I didn't like the new family and I didn't like any of the new mutants in the film. Excessive gore doesn't make up for character. And I am no prude to violence of that nature, but honestly I was bored for the majority of the film.Also I didn't like the nuclear theme being brought up in the opening credits. I think it would have been better if this was revealed at the time it was in the movie not at the start cause then it would have had a better twist.I have not watched the sequel to the film but I will do because that's the sort of person I am and I will watch it in the hope it is a new story and will obviously be better than the God awful sequel by Wes Craven.I must also add I thought the 2009 remake of The Last House on The Left was pointless, it too lacked the charm and character of the original, but I enjoyed it slightly more than this.Finally, I do also think if I watched this film at the cinema in 2005/2006 before seeing the original I probably would have liked it more but it reminded me of Leatherface, plenty of gore but doesn't captivate.I now want to watch the original again and I may review it in due course.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

First blood to the mutated cannibals, but those city folk sure are driven by their primal instincts to avenge monstrous creatures that society turned into savages. Watching the contrasting families, all with their own defining characteristics which the narrative builds upon, go tooth and nail at each other, momentum swinging either way, gives the film its core. All in all it is great late night fun slasher fare with insane lashings of violence and foul play driven by a dirty metal riff.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A shadow of a deeper thought can not be found in the desert,"-The film lacks a scent of humor or even a political reference, which should be expected due to the Motive of victimized inhabitants of the desert.

"Decent remake, not much more...","Wes Craven's The Hills Have Eyes is a horror classic. Extremely disturbing and intense. This remake is pretty much the same apart from a few minor tweaks. Usually I am against horror remakes, I see them as pointless, money-grubbing affairs that never top the original. Although this isn't as good as the 1977 version, it's still an intense and well made horror movie.The movie opens with images from nuclear testing. There are some disturbing images of mutations and explosions. We then enter present day, the Carter family are travelling through New Mexico to California. They stop off at a gas station and get directions from the crazy attendant. Of course, this shortcut causes them to crash. Big Bob (Ted Levine) and Doug (Aaron Standford) split up to find help while the rest of the family stay behind. At night, the mutants raid the trailer.....Alexandre Aja has done a decent job with this remake. High Tension, his other film, was very well made. It was scary and suspenseful and it packed a punch in the gore department. THHE doesn't either. This movie is extremely gory and quite disturbing. But by the end, the gore doesn't become anything at all, since there is so much being thrown at you.The special effects are brilliant as is the brooding score. The hills aren't as haunting this time but are still quite creepy. The acting was fairly good from all, nothing outstanding.I'd recommend this for gorehounds or fans of the original.3/5.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Average remake of an overrated ""classic""","I wasn't impressed by Wes Craven's original movie so it was with more than a little trepidation that I sat down to watch the 2006 glossy remake. Despite a relatively impressive opening, my instincts proved correct. While the new film is a reasonable re-imagining of the original, it still suffers from the poor premise.With both Craven's and Aja's movies, I've felt very little empathy for the characters. While I like horror films, the nihilistic elements of ""Hills"" has always left me feeling somewhat cold.The film does have some redeeming features. There are some brief scenes of tension towards the finale and the effects work is top drawer stuff. The cast is pleasing and the cinematography is beautiful.What lets the film down is an overall sense of suspense for the most part and the overall premise doesn't really work for me. Both the original and remakes of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" stand head and bloody shoulders above these efforts.6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
For Parents and the MPAA alike...,"I'll just start by stating this is a VERY well made film. Good production value, sound, visuals, performances, etc... It's a relentless, thrilling, scary freakin' ride! Don't know what the point of the film is - but does it really matter? This is a horror remake that can truly be labeled ""HORROR"". It offers a true sense of dread. I can't say I ""enjoyed"" it. It wasn't ""fun"". It was, however, horrifying. It seems like movie makers, like video game designers are interested in shock value, pushing the moral envelope, if you will. Since there is so much real terror in the world now, then our entertainment should be that much more, right? Maybe. As long as we, as adults, can decipher what is real and what is fiction... we should be okay, right? Maybe. It's when I buy a theater ticket to The Hills Have Eyes remake, and see a guy, his girlfriend, and their 3 kids (all three clearly UNDER the age of 8) sitting in front of me that makes me sick to my stomach. In my opinion, this movie is a clear case where the MPAA should have rated it with an NC-17. And parents, even if it's only an R rating, do you, your kids, and the rest of the viewing audience a favor, and LEAVE the little ones with a freakin' babysitter.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Great Horror Film.....Truly Horrifying!,"A family is driving across the desert wastes of New Mexico on their way to San Diego. It's the last trip for the whole family as one daughter has married and has a child, and the other two kids are reaching an age where family trips aren't quite as fun anymore. But dad has just retired from the police force and it he and his wife's wedding anniversary so it's a special occasion. None of the kids wanted to take the cross-country trip in the Suburban with an old Airstream trailer in tow but it was for the parents so you suck it up and do it. On their way through the desert an old man who owns a fill-up station tells them of a short cut that will save them a couple of hours drive time. Wonderful. When they take this shortcut though the family quickly finds out that it's no short cut at all, but a trap set by a family living in the hills that cover this desert. A family with a taste for human flesh. And now this suburban family will have to fight for their lives against another family that is barely human, a family that has made its livelihoods on preying on travelers coming through their hills, and a family with some monstrous secrets that won't be secret much longer. So if the movie is damned close to the original in its story ¬ñ identical in fact save for some important fleshing out ¬ñ why the hell do I like it more than the original? The aforementioned fleshing out is why. In this version the hill family, and there are a lot more of them this time around, come straight out of a nightmare. Deformed and deranged, this family doesn't just seem like hill people who have lived out in the wilds too long but like true mutants that are no longer human at all. These are truly monsters, and they act monstrously. And director Aja allows the family to act their fury and their horror out instead of giving them dialogue. These are monsters and monsters rarely need to say a damned thing to be monstrous. I also love that the story of where these people come from and what made them is expanded. Sure, we hear about the fact that nuclear testing made this freakish family but it's far more powerful when we see it and see where they live. And I liked that the husband to the family's daughter is such a weasel because it makes his story arc so much more interesting when you see it come to fruition. All is not perfect however. There are some very odd musical cues here that all but work to take the air out of scenes. I can't really remember us finding out solidly that the gas station owner is the father, to a degree, of this family of mutants. Unless they decided to change that fact altogether, they make it pretty vague. A strength in the original was the back-story on Papa Jupiter and poor old Jupe is kinda relegated to a bit part in the film, which is a shame. There is also one edit that drove me nuts, where the camera pushes in on something but there are jump cuts added in as well. Ack! So there are some bumps on this road but not so many that it derails a pretty good movie. And a pretty nasty movie. I know there were a lot of young people in our showing and at least two young women walked out. Why? 'Cause this isn't a fun horror film, something we have gotten a lot of in the past few years. There are no real laughs, there are no ghost kids, and this is not PG-13. This is a hard 'R' rated horror film that will upset a lot of people. As well it should. It wasn't made to give a few light scares but to freak you the hell out. Whether it goes too far is up to each individual to decide but for me, it nailed the feel it should have. This is an unsettling story and feels that way. I like the original Hills but I really like this remake. The direction is great, the camera-work is superb, the scares are solid, and the makeup fx is amazing. Myself, I have problems with a few things in it but it wasn't enough to ruin the movie for me and it was actually better than I expected it to be, and that's always nice to find. I recommend this for horror fans looking for another hardcore movie to remind them why they love the genre but casual fans might sit this one out.Definitely Worth A Rent!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Definitely one for the horror fans,"I would of rated this a 6 but I thought I'd be generous and bump it up to a 7 due to bobby being such a savage, I mean literally the bloke is indestructible, he actually makes the movie as frustrating.

The acting is alright nothing amazing but it's believable, some of the mutants are that realistic and scary it's pure nightmare fuel.

Not too Bad...,"Along with many other fans of the original, I was pretty annoyed when I learnt that it was getting the remake treatment. However, that was before a mate of mine pointed out that Alexander ""switchblad Romance"" Aja was at the helm. Although i haden't seen Switchblad Romance, i had read the reviews, seen clips from the film, and was able to deduce that the man has a considerable amount of talent. Indeed, the script for this film, which mercifully does not rely too much on old clich√©s, sets the tone and pace very well. the story is pretty basic, so could have turned out badly in the wrong hands, but it proves to not only follow the original closely, but also to add some interesting twists. You see, i find that many remakes, although good films, do not follow the original closely enough (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, House of Wax), which makes us wonder if the makers have actually SEEN the original, or too closely (psycho, the Omen), which leaves us wondering what the point is, but this is a very well done adaptation that Wes Craven should surely be proud of. It features nice character development, unusually good acting, great special FX, and enough blood to keep all gorehounds well chuffed. fans will love it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

It does exactly what it says on the tin,"Extremely nasty, (the gore factor is stomach-churningly high for those that like that sort of thing), but a terrifically effective shocker nevertheless. On one level director Alexander Aja may be appealing to the slasher brigade but he also knows how to crank the tension all the way up to eleven and the film works as a genuinely frightening comment on the (literal) nuclear family, even more so than was the case with Wes Craven's celebrated original.The problem is that the family at the centre are so unlikeable and act so dumbly you may be inclined to side with the mutants even if they are presented in a far less sympathetic light than previously. Still, it should appeal to anyone who rates ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" as a satire on a warped consumerist society as well as a great horror movie. The rebirth of the film's obnoxious 'liberal' hero as a macho superman will obviously remind you of Dustin Hoffman's similar transformation in ""Straw Dogs"" and the whole thing is very dubious.

Eyes see You!,"***SPOILERS*** Incredibly grossed-out sequel to the 1977 original ""The Hills Have Eyes"" follows the 1977 version almost scene for scene until some half hour into the movie. It's then, with the advancement of special effects over the last thirty years, the movie becomes an almost unwatchable horror show.Traveling to California Big Bob, Ted Levin, and his family stop off at this out of the way gas station, in the middle of the New Mexican desert. After filling up their given directions to a short cut through the hill by the somewhat creepy gas station attendant Tom Bower. It turns out that old Tom is working with a number of psychos who have it in for the human race because of the condition that they find themselves in; due the the years of nuclear testing in that part of the country.Disabling Big Bob's van, and the trailer attached to it, the unseen killers wait for darkness to fall and then make their move on the helpless, and unsuspecting, stranded travelers. With Big Bob going back to the gas station for help he's shocked to see old Tom laying drunk in the outhouse talking to himself. Before Big Bob can figure out what's wrong with Tom he takes out a shotgun and blows his brains out. Running to Old Toms car Big Bob is then attacked, by one of the many weirdos in the movie who ties him to a tree and sets it on fire.The next ten or so minutes in the movie with the out of hiding mutants attacking Big Bob's family are so disturbing and shocking, even to grown ups, that I'm surprised that the movie ""The Hills Have Eyes"" didn't get an X-rating just for it's graphic violence alone. Breaking into the trailer the psychos fall upon Big Bob's younger daughter Brenda ,Emilie De Ravin, and manhandle, and possibly rape, her so badly that it's almost a miracle that she didn't end up losing her mind much less her life. Both Big Bob's wife Ethel and his older daughter Lynn, Kathleen Quinlan & Vinessa Shaw, are then viciously murdered. Lynn and her husbands Doug, Aaron Stanford, infant daughter Catherine is then kidnapped by the killers who take off into the hills.Big Bob's teenage son Bobby, Dan Byrd, had earlier gone out in the hills to find one of his pet German Shepherds Beauty and, after finding Beauty torn to pieces, fell off a cliff almost breaking his head. Helped by one of the psychos children Ruby(Laura Ortiz), who was about the most normal of the bunch, Bobby had some idea of what was in the hills but was just too traumatized and afraid to tell any of his family members. Now, with both his patents and sister-in-law murdered, Bobby becomes almost insane with anger only wanting to get even with those who did him family in.Lynn's husband Doug a life long pacifist and anti-gun activist also changes his opinion of guns and knives and every other weapon of death. Now becoming almost as ferocious and kill crazy as those who did Lynn in, and took his infant daughter Catherine away with them. This sets up the audience, who still have the nerve and stomach to stay around to watch the movie, for what has to be some of the most unwatchable and horrific scenes in motion picture history.Defintly not for the meek and weak at heart ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is not the kind of movie that you'd take a girl, whom you want to impress, out to see. The violence in the film almost turns cartoon-like with both the killers and Doug and to a lesser extent Bobby and Brenda having it out in a battle of life and death in the empty desert as well as in a deserted town that was the test site and target of atomic explosions. Doug together with his pet dog Beast take on almost the entire band of mutant/psychos in his attempt to rescue his daughter. Dough ends up so badly beaten and mauled by these crazies that it's hard to believe that he's still alive by the time the movies over. Bobby and his sister Brenda have a somewhat easier time of it only having to deal with what seems like the head man or psycho of the bunch with him ending up blown straight to kingdom come, together with the family trailer, at the end of the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Still Weighing It,"I've never seen the original Wes Craven version of The Hills Have Eyes, so I will not be comparing this one to that one. However, as its own beast, it's good, but it's frustrating in some ways. It's apart of this new batch of slasher and horror movies, where the cinematography is boisterously gritty and choppy, the script and the acting are more contrived in the melodrama department than horror films before the 21st century, etc. It seems to have boomed since High Tension came to America and though its plot disappointed it carried itself in a manner and style much above average, keeping us riveted with its brutalizing tension and suspense. Its director, Alexander Aja, spends his sophomore effort here with this film.His suspense remains very fulfilling and very nervous, his cinematography is stale and overused by now but it does work well, his attention-grabbing stylistic details are kind of fun, and Ted Levine and Kathleen Quinlan are good, even if their roles are almost painfully clich√©. That is this film's biggest drawback. It not only completes a competent checklist of all horror/slasher/survival film/thriller/sci-fi clich√©s, but accents a few of the more frustrating ones. Among these particularly frustrating clich√©s are the use of animal death as a precursor to the terror upon the humans. Yes, I'm very biased because I am an incredible animal lover and I hate it when animal cruelty is seen as ""Hm. Strange,"" and when humans are terrorized, not only are they surprised at their dangerous situation after they've practically ignored their pet(s) being mauled, but they treat human casualties as something so incomparable to the death of an innocent animal. But aside from this bias, aren't you tired of knowing as soon as you see an animal in a horror film that that animal is going to die? Another painfully hackneyed inanity here is its entire exposition. The film almost confuses itself, for instance by making Quinlan's character a strict, structural mother and still making her the cool mom that can talk about pot with her kids. The dialogue is so loaded with routine that it defeats itself when trying to develop its characters.The horror franchise is almost founded upon giving the audience what they expect, which is entirely the WRONG WAY TO DO IT. Horror films need shocks and surprises, yet nearly every one, even these new high-production-value slashers, can't help but succumb to them. However, Aja has somehow kept The Hills Have Eyes suspenseful enough to entertain, even if he let it be too much of a stereotype to be memorable.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very Good Remake!,"Here it is, usually remakes are horrible. Usually nothing is as great as the original. I wasn't expecting a full throttle horror freak out but I wasn't expecting a cheap piece of trash. Lets just say that The Hills Have Eyes totally changed my perspective on remakes! This movie was insane! Great scares, good gore, sweat breaking suspense, and a terrifying storyline. The brilliant thing about The Hills Have Eyes is that you care for the characters and through every scene your cheering them on to kill those creatures. You can feel their pain through every scene and that just makes the movie even better. This is not for the weak stomach, there is definitely some disturbing content. But if your in to these kind of movies and you can handle gore and some big entertainment, scares, thrills, and suspense. Then you will definitely enjoy The Hills Have Eyes.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not as Scary as the Original but Still Fun to Watch,"This movie starts off great. The opening title sequence is beautifully done -- everything, that is, except the title credits themselves. On a big screen they may have been readable, but reduced to a TV screen they are a messy glob of orange. Dark orange which is absorbed by the density of the images behind them. Maybe it's time for movie companies and post houses to start considering that film titles and TV titles are two different things, and separate sets could be made. At least until five foot TV screens are the norm. That is, when everyone has them. Not just the people designing the credits.The casting of the family is superb. What a blessing to see a horror film with a mostly unknown cast. No supermodel ing√©nues like Jessica Biel or Sara Michelle Gellar to detract from the illusion of reality. Considering the quasi-verite feel of the original, which was a huge part of its power, this was an especially wise choice. The costumes and make-up are magnificently mundane, contributing to the build-up of tension. These are characters any average human can relate to, and the hints that they are stepping into something horrific effectively prime us for an explosion of horror.Unfortunately that promise is broken the moment we meet our first bad guy. While the casting of the family is sublime, the actors chosen for the mutant freaks is soft and unconvincing. The lamely designed make-up never disguises the fact that these are normal, even attractive actors. One can only assume that the director, who handled so many aspects of this production perfectly, took a miscalculated gamble that the make-up itself would render the characters frightening. Either that, or someone decided that they wanted this to be a soft horror film. Something to appeal to the undemanding, middle-of-the-road audience, rather than the hardcore horror fans.One of the creepiest things about Wes Craven's original version was the believability of the hill people. Michael Berryman's freakish features combined with his subtly bizarre costume were more unsettling than any of the characters in this remake. Even in their special efx make-up, the new freaks are about as scary as something you'd expect to find in a circus sideshow.One real treat in this film is the cinematography. This is perhaps the most exciting piece of cinematography in the horror genre since Adam Greenberg worked with Kathryn Bigelow on ""Near Dark."" Hopefully the young Belgian cinematographer will continue to grace movies worthy of his very distinctive style, and not wind up shooting bloated Hollywood turkeys... or worse, directing humongous turkeys like Jan de Bont.Older horror fans who caught the original version in a theatre will no doubt view this differently than younger viewers who have no pre-conceived expectations. Those who do note the difference have to call into question Wes Craven's influence in making this one a bit glossier and less frightening. Every year sees more Wes Craven productions, with a wide range of success. The sheer volume and disparity suggests he's more of a rubber stamp than an actual hands on producer -- but the lack of true scariness in this movie may also be the mark of his older, softer sensibilities imposed upon the director.While not as scary as the original, this is an enjoyable film. It's the kind of ""horror movie"" that a true horror fan can sit through in the company of friends who are fans of the kind of horror which isn't really very scary but can scare the pants off them.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Ambitious movie, but Aja missed his point","The scariest part of the movie may be its opening, which makes me dreamed of a remake of ""Hills have eyes"", somewhere between Tod Browning's ""Freaks"" - for the deformed characters - and Tobe Hooper's ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" - for the rotten atmosphere.Helas, Alexandre Aja rapidly chooses another direction : more fun and distantiation. Of course, the film is gore (a lot more than the other recent 70's horror movies remakes) and could be somehow shocking (I agree with that for the rape scene), but it can't really traumatize the public. It doesn't go to far in pure horror because of the monsters, who are shown without any humanity left (exept for the little girl). They're like carnival's figure or clowns, a grotesque caricature of the normal family, which makes them unreal and untruth.This treatment of the evil characters - all in exaggeration - undo the fear they could have deeply inspired, for an immediate but not durable thrill.

Not since George A. Romero...,"Not since George A. Romero has there been a director that is willing to take their movie to the next level in the horror genre. When Romero showed the living dead munching on the skin and bones of the actual living in 1968, people gasped in horror and disgusting, yet today, Night Of The Living Dead is a horror classic.Alexandre Aja is the 21st century's answer to the zombie legend. Starting big with a cult-y very original ode to the 70's horror style ""Haute Tension"" to yet another horror remake: ""The Hills Have Eyes"" Many, many of the top film reviewers do not realize what decade they're living in. Roger Ebert, this is not the 1960's. Our society isn't keen on the horror ""parlor tricks"" of the 60's, showing people eating chicken although exclaiming they're chowing down on the flesh of humans. Our culture needs more visually shocking horror films to give us that sense of terror of the random people in the world being so villainous to commit these act of violence.""The Hills Have Eyes"" is that type of movie. As it gets going after the mandatory 45 minutes of character development, the movie's brutality does not stop. Throat-munching dogs, burnings (√¢ la Joan of Arc), throat stabbings with the American flag, an over-sized nuclear-deformed cranium, explosions, a freezer full of dismembered limbs and torsos, visually stunning facial deconstruction with a shotgun, and (the most recognizable trademark of Aja) numerous axe shots to the back, head, fingers, and chest.""The Hills"" isn't meant to win big at the Acadamy Awards, another major aspect major movie critics forget. Horror movies are changing. The past five years have brought more visually-pleasing cinematography and more visually-stunning violence. This is where ""The Hills"" wins big on both accounts.

I liked how they just grazed over the topic of politics and showed all of the characters love/hate for each other. Some scenes were almost taken too far, like in almost all horror movies people just can't seem to die they just keep fighting and fighting until some ultimate end.

The cannibals were more likable and normal in the original. Also, the themes and symbolism was great too. Having a normal family turn to their dark side and being just as savage as their enemies is neater than suggesting the negative after effects of atomic testing like in the remake.

Also, there is no snakes like in the original.It has some gruesome deaths and disturbing scenes. Watching your dad burn to death is very bad and that really wasn't the worst part. One of the final fight scenes between Doug and the big mutant was good. It's like the mutant had the chance to finish him with the ax but gets too cocky. That was great.

And because this is a horror movie, the family listens to the gas attendant's advice and follows the shortcut only to find out that it's a trap. The family is now stranded in the hills of some unknown desert in New Mexico only to find a group of deformed miners who were victims of nuclear testing seeking their revenge on humanity. Lots of blood and violence ensueFirst things first, how come almost every time I go to see a horror movie in the theater I have to deal with idiotic people who either talk through the entire film or bring little kids to the film? In my case I was lucky to experience both in one place. So note to parents, leave the kids at home, this type of movie is not appropriate for your kids. And secondly for those who want to give their social commentary during the film please wait until it's over or go outside the theater to do so. Thank you. Anyway despite my frustration by this I was still able to sit back and enjoy majority of the film.I personally didn't find ""The Hills has Eyes"" a great movie by any means but I think it was a decent horror movie especially for a genre that usually produces very bad movies. After seeing director Alexandre Aja's last film, ""High Tension"" which I really enjoyed, I was very excited about seeing ""The Hills have Eyes"" but sadly after seeing it I do not feel it lived up to all the internet hype surrounding it.The main problem is that the movie's plot is very similar to majority of horror movies. A family gets stranded in a desert which no one else knows about. Something bad happens and more bad things happen as the film goes on. ""The Hills Have Eyes"" however does a great job of building suspense and you are pretty much at the edge of your seat during the entire film. The movie also contains some of the most violent and gruesome scenes I have seen in a horror film which seems to be Aja's trademark for horror films. Both of his movies have a lot of violence, a lot of blood, and a lot of gruesome images.The one main problem I had with the film was character development. Yes, I know it's a horror movie and not a drama but I do still expect a little. This movie does very little to provide character development. In fact, I felt like I could careless about most of the characters. The only characters you felt bad for was the baby and the little sister Brenda (Emilie de Ravin). And you only felt bad for Brenda because of what happens to her later in the film because something happens to her that no one should ever have to experience. Other than that the characters just seem so typical and lame that you really don't care about any of them.Also the film gets a little too much near the end; the violence goes a little over the top and the invisible character (you know the guy or girl who keeps getting stabbed, shot or killed but keeps coming back to life) becomes a little too clich√©d. And when the film ended I literally laughed because I found the ending to be so ridiculously typical and clich√©d that I couldn't do anything but laugh at it. The acting at times as well is a little weak but then again this is a horror film and even ones I have really enjoyed never have that good of acting. I wonder why horror movies can never have really decent acting. I don't understand this but hey it's the genre is so I can really blame Aja for that.In the end ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is a decent horror movie, it's not the best film in the genre but it is certainly not the worst. The director, Mr. Aja definitely has a skill for creating very violent and gory films. I just hope the next time he directs a film he can add a little more substance and thought to it like he did with ""High Tension."" Overall I can't say I didn't enjoy myself watching this film, it was very suspenseful and had a lot of action. It is definitely a must see for those who are a fan of the horror genre.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is a 7/10. Please for the love god if you are going to see this movie don't bring any kids under the age of 12 with you. It's really not appropriate at all for them.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gripping and Gritty,"I recently watched ""The Hills Have Eyes"" and thought it was a pretty good movie. At first, I wasn't sure what to expect, but it turned out to be quite entertaining.The story follows a family who gets stranded in the desert and ends up being hunted by a group of mutated people. The setting was really creepy, and the sense of isolation added a lot to the tension. I found myself on the edge of my seat for most of the movie.The characters were interesting, and I got really invested in their survival. The way they fought back was intense and kept me hooked. The villains were genuinely scary, and the makeup and effects used to create their look were impressive. It made the whole situation feel even more real and terrifying.One thing I really liked was how the movie didn't shy away from showing the brutal side of survival. It was gritty and sometimes hard to watch, but it felt honest. The suspense and action scenes were well done, and I appreciated the balance between them.Overall, while ""The Hills Have Eyes"" might not be everyone's cup of tea, I found it to be a solid horror movie. It had a good mix of scares and thrills, and I enjoyed watching it. If you're into horror and don't mind a bit of gore, it's definitely worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best horror movie since loooooong time,"OK finally.....after waiting several years, there is finally a horror movie that rises above my expectations. Where many horror films of the last years which i expected very much of, like The boogeyman, The grudge(omfg), Exorcist Dominion, and many many more. Where BIG disappointments and i was beginning to think that nowadays they forgot how to make a real horror film.But then there came The Hills Have Eyes. Expected much from it but got more they i expected.No fooling around with cutting all the good stuff out, or let everything to your imagination. NO fake CGI crap. No, just real life terror.Do not think i only love this movie so much because of the blood and gore. But the tension and suspense is great to. Acting is great. And very important, you could believe this was really happening. For instance i saw Stay Alive last week. this crap movie about a video game if u play it you die. OK the idea was nice but....if u see the movie it was so unbelievable. You could never ever imagine how such a thing could happen for real.The Hills Have Eyes is very believable and that gives extra creepiness to it.So if you are in for a ride behind the hills...GO WATCH THIS MOVIE10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not bad for a remake,"Personally, I have been watching horror movies for years now. I've seen the original and the original was really good. The re-make on the other hand really wasn't great but it wasn't bad either. The characters that were portrayed really seemed weird especially bobby's sister (which I don't remember her name). Some of her crying scenes seemed fake but then again, she did have one that was believable. As for the deformed people, the make-up was just amazing. Well done on that. Doug as a character really showed out right after Lizard took Katherine. From being a pacifist (in my eyes) then going on a huge killing spree really portrayed him as a ""ballsy"" character. So all together, 6 out of 10 is my rating.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
most disgusting claim to horror I've ever seen,"to all those of you who claim that this was what horror fans were waiting for you ought to be locked away to save humanity from your presence in society. cravens remake of the hills have eyes was the most disgusting display of shock value I've ever witnessed in my entire life. I was forced to exit the theatre to save my mind from the degenerative effects of finishing this film. horror is an art that cannot be tampered with. one cannot put rape, butchering, torture, burning, mutation, slaughter, and cannibalism into a five minute period as was done in the scene in the trailer and pass it off as horror. this film should be reserved for sickos who feel the need to watch it in a dark room alone with the blinds pulled so the neighbors don't witness them doing so. i am a huge horror fan and this movie evoked the need to vomit in the theater. this is not horror. this is disgusting and immoral. this should never have made it past script.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Blood in the hills...,"""The Hills Have Eyes"" is a horror movie which has to do with an American family who is being stalked by some psychotic people who live in the desert and they are very far from civilization.I liked this movie because it had many moments with suspense and because of the plot. I also liked it because of the cast and their interpretations and especially Emilie de Ravin's interpretation who played as Brenda Carter. Another good interpretation made by Vinessa Shaw who played as Lynn Carter.Finally I have to admit that I did not expect that this movie could be so unexpected and not as nice as it was in the end.

Excellent new take on a 70s classic!,"Right after the worldwide success of the excellent violent horror film ""Haute Tension"", French director Alexandre Aja found himself under the spotlight as one of the new talents in the horror genre. Asked by director Wes Craven to rewrite his own 70s horror movie ""The Hills Have Eyes"", Aja accepted to write the remake but as the project got bigger, Aja finally accepted to direct the film himself. The remake of Craven's violently gory tale of a dark ruthless side of America remained mostly faithful to the original, although Aja certainly did add his own touch and aimed for a subtler (but still appropriate) social cometary this time. This new version of the old 70s classic really plays its chances and does what every remake should do: try to actually improve the previous film. And surprisingly, it succeeds.As in the original, ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is the tale of the Carters, an all-American family on a trip through the American southwest as they head to California for a nice Vacation together. While crossing the most difficult part of New Mexico's desert, their vehicle's tires blow and soon they find themselves stuck in the middle of the desert. Apparently without any way to get help, the family members' own personal differences begin to arise, but their familiar difficulties will be the least of their troubles as they discover that their accident was in fact a trap, a trap set by another all-American family, that just happens to be a bit twisted.Alexandre Aja and his regular collaborator Gr√©gory Levasseur take Craven's original nightmarish plot about the violent meeting of two sides of America and flesh out the story giving some more details about the origin of the mutant family. As in his previous movie, ""Haute Tension"", suspense and tension play a role as big as the violence and the gore, and the long scenes of introduction of the characters are a key factor in this: Aja and Levasseur create believable and overall likable characters, so realistic that it's really easy to be identified with them and be terrified by the horrors they have to endure. While the film may not offer something truly original, I found that the way it develops the characters is really what makes it so effective.As in his previous two films, Aja makes an excellent use of color and cinematography to create haunting atmospheres of isolation and hopelessness. The graphic violence displayed on the film is ruthless and without remorse (specially during the first attack), but what makes the film so powerful is the way Aja builds up the situation, making the actual violence seem even more disturbing than what's shown on screen. While the film still follows some of the conventions of modern horror (mainly the editing style), it somehow recaptures the spirit of the original's ""grindhouse"" way of film-making.The acting in the film is remarkably realistic, as most of the cast does an excellent job, particularly Aaron Stanford and Vinessa Shaw, who are very effective. Stanford truly stole every of his scenes and ends up being an excellent lead actor. Ted Levine, Billy Drago, Tom Bower and Kathleen Quinlan are the experienced side of the cast, and without problem show their talent even when their roles are somewhat small (Sadly, Billy Drago's screen time is almost a cameo). Dan Byrd and Emilie De Ravin are the youngest and show a huge potential as their reactions to the horrors in the film are nothing short of believable.As far as remakes go, it's safe to count Aja's take on ""The Hills Have Eyes"" as one of the best, not only in terms of being an excellent horror film, but also as a movie that shows respect for the original while adding some good new ideas (as well as better technology for the effects) to an already known plot. Probably my biggest complain would be that Aja's decision of taking the mutants out of the spotlight makes Craven's cometary too subtle to be noticed (they look less as a family, and more as a gang of monsters), however, I can understand his reasons, as the now enhanced mystery surrounding their actions truly adds to the suspense and tension that Aja was going for.""The Hills Have Eyes"" may not be a turning point in cinema, or a very original film (it's still a remake after all), but it certainly delivers what one looks in a horror film of this kind: captivating plot, enough suspense, and horrifying violence. All in all, it may not become a classic, but it's good enough to give it a chance. Alexandre Aja is showing a lot of talent, and one wonders what he'll show us in the future. 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A truly scary and unsettling film.,"Let me start by saying the title sequence for this film is very well done and really sets the mood for this nuclear horror. I always appreciate a good atmospheric title sequence. The performances are authentic and convincing in this movie. Before long I have forgotten I'm watching a movie and I am immersed in the hot desert with this stranded mid-western family on a vacation gone wrong. This movie is a feather plucked from the same bird as any Toby Hooper horror film. A truly violent movie, some of the scenes are difficult to watch and leave one feeling violated and horrified. The music is nostalgic, the papa's and mamma's, obscure classic country rock creates an atmosphere that pays homage to classic 70s slashers while misleading the viewer into an ""everything's alright"" state of mind. It isn't before long that things start to take a turn for the worse. People fear what they don't understand and rightly so in this scenario. I give this movie 5 bags of popcorn. For a truly immersive experience try watching this film on a hot summer day in the middle of a desert.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Superior Remake,"Yes, you heard me, a SUPERIOR remake. The original movie, despite being a Friday Night video classic throughout the eighties, really wasn't a particularly good film. It always seemed like a cheap remake of 'Texas Chain Saw Massacre' in the desert, but without the atmosphere, the suspense, or the scares. The remade 'The Hills Have Eyes' manages to be surprisingly faithful to the original in story, while improving on it on almost every level. The characters are more believable, the performances more professional, the narrative is tighter, the suspense more masterfully built. The crazies here actually seem crazy, rather than the lumbering cavemen morons of the original, and the production design, especially when we arrive at the 1950's test village, is excellent.That's not to say that it's a great movie. It's entertaining and enjoyable, but what you see is what you get and there's nothing beneath the surface that could ever warrant a second viewing. It's nice to see that the recent re-emergence of hard-R horror is restoring a little quality control to a genre that has been descending headlong into creative Armageddon the last few years. These movies, from the 'Texas Chain Saw' remake to 'Hostel' aren't BAD, but they have yet to produce a bona fide classic either. Not sucking is no longer an acceptable objective. Now we want to see something that is actually good.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Aja defies , and conquers !","Being the craze at the moment that is with Hollywood (prequels,remakes and sequels)it was just a matter of time before they went ahead and remade this. However people should be glad to know that the man in the directors seat this time was Alexander Aja and if you have seen his french horror master-piece High tension your headed for a good time! Aja's take was different from Wes Craven's in the sense that this time round he shows us a travelling family on vacation going through the New Mexico desert where the U.S. government had secretly been conducting atomic energy blast and this is vividly explained all in the opening credits not leaving much to the imagination however the survivors of these nuclear explosion show us what did not kill them , only made them more insane! There is no time wasting in this one as we dive straight into the action and waste little time with things like character development (hey they all gonna die after all). The camera angels and cinematography is used in a brilliant way to show the vastness of the mountains and really giving the viewer that they truly are stuck in the middle of nowhere but then also shows a close up focus of how the horrors and consequences caused by radiation. Gorehounds and horror fans shall be pleased by the levels of blood , and body count and not to mention body parts flying about! and Aja also manages to weave our heroic dog into as homage and respect to Wes Cravens original. Another great thing was the cynical tone it had with the family members which made it all the more realistic.To conclude , very rarely a remake can over take an original and especially one like The Hills have Eyes which has a devoted cult following but again , it shows that if you go away and do homework then you can inject something new fresh and make it worth while checking out. I recommend this to fans of the original and horror/gore fans or maybe people who are just in need of some entertainment during a boring summer day. I would not be at all surprised if this one started developing a following or people saying they prefer this to the original hopefully a remake of part two will make up for the original shambled part 2.THE HILLS HAVE EYES - 8.9 OUT OF 10THE LUCKY ONES DIED FIRST!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A sick little puppy.,"In this remake of Wes Craven's 1977 cult hit, a family stops for petrol in a remote New Mexico desert, only to discover that the road less traveled is best left that way, but then we wouldn't have a film.From the opening minute, its clear young French wunderkind, Alexandre Aja (Haute Tension) has this journey under his control, and what a sick, twisted little trek it is. It's very violent, perhaps unnecessarily so, though it does add to the tension and increases the payoff. Sometimes the characters act so stupidly you think that they deserve what they get, but this wouldn't be a horror film if the players acted with sense. It's almost as though the Darwinian theory is at work here, but then it doesn't go the way you expect, which is part of the reason it works so well. The writing team of Aja and his usual cohort, Gr√©gory Levasseur provide plenty of suspense and a solid back-story for their desert loving maniacs. They also throw Middle America into the mix by assembling a family that is Republican and religious; there's even a newborn in tow, something you don't see in the average horror flick, and this certainly isn't one of those.Hills ranks as one of the very few worthy remakes in recent times; I found myself enjoying it in spite of myself. This plays at many emotional levels, and questions our propensity for revenge. Exactly how far would you need to be pushed before you react with violence, no matter what your political leanings and beliefs? A smart, slick, but sick little puppy.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The movie was disgusting.....,"The movie was disgusting..... A few people left the theater early. There was even a lot who didn't leave but were crying it was so horrific.. Shouldn't have made it to the movie theater.. No one needs to see crap like that. The only people who would actually enjoy this movie have got to be twisted and sick. There are horror films out there that actually have some kind of good thing about them but this whole movie was just ridiculous.. Makes you really scared of anyone who has an abnormality. The only good part was when something you didn't expect with a little girl happened. I wanted to puke this movie was so stupid. I guess I can see the point that they are saying we shouldn't' be doing nuclear testing and that it might effect people in a wrong way.. But if stuff like that happened, I don't think that people would think they were okay enough to stay in the area that's being bombed. If they were like that then the government would probably go take them and test them. I guess it wouldn't' be a movie then but it was just a scar on my brain after I watched this.

Moments of sheer brilliance are ruined by moments of pure stupidity.,"This comment contains very mild spoilers Let's start off by saying that although I thoroughly enjoyed Alexandre Aja's remake of Wes Craven's groundbreaking shocker THE HILLS HAVE EYES, most of what I will focus on in this review is comparing the original to the remake, and to Aja's other film HIGH TENSION.THE HILLS HAVE EYES starts off with a laughably bad opening scene. I dunno if Aja intended laughs with this part, but there's something comical about a 7 foot deformed Neanderthal mutant spinning an astronaut around with a pick-axe in the middle of the desert. Is it just me? Now that is an example of one incredibly dumb scenes.After that we are treated to an awesome credits, with a cool 50s song and footage of deformities and nuclear explosions. I have to give props to modern horror films, the opening credits always deliver something interesting.Following the credits we meet an old gas station owner packing up his store. Enter a nice typical all-American god fearing family; the Carters. Father (Big Bob Carter), mother (Ethel Carter), eldest daughter (Lynn Carter), eldest daughters daughter (Catherine) and husband (Doug), younger daughter (Brenda Carter), son (Bobby Carter) and two faithful dogs (Beauty and Beast). The family are shown the off-road route by the gas station owner and told they can take the back way to say a few hours drive.The gas station owner was poorly acted. In the original, John Steadman portrayed the disturbed old man with a campy, charismatic and frantic charm about him. It seemed as though Tom Bower just wanted to get out of the role as quickly as possible, and his performance was rushed and hollow.When the family station wagon and Winnebago crash off the road, the Carters are stranded in the middle of the desert. Big Bob pulls out two guns, gives one to his son Bobby and keeps one for himself, and Doug and Big Bob head off in different directions looking for some help. When are clan of cannibalistic mutants attack the family in their Winnebago, the resulting film could have been a horror fans wet-dream. Rape, cannibalism, a cool setting, cool music, dismemberment, mutants, homage to famous films, hot young things, home invasions, revenge, sadism, everything a fan could hope for. But THHE is missing something. The mutants have no personality, unlike in the original, when the mutants had ALL the personality. They're not recognizable, and the scenes are not suspenseful. Aja goes all out for shocks and jump scares, where as Craven went for suspense and little violence. Intead of Brendas blood curdling screams terrifying you, it was that a mutant was sticking his meat in her. Instead of Lynns fight for the life of her child, she's getting her breast milk drunk. Instead of a social commentary on who the real evil is and which family rally is more civilized, Aja ditches that and goes for a pretty poorly done kill-the-monster-you-created angle.One of my favourite things about this film were the kills were very well done, the rape scene was pretty suspenseful (I loved the rock musical score), Big Bobs capture was also suspenseful, and the best part was how much Doug was willing to do for the life of Catherine. There was also a cool homage to one o my favourites, TRUE ROMANCE, where Doug, clearly defeated, sticks an ice pick through a mutants foot and resourcefully gets the better of him.The acting was good, I liked the casting of Emile De Ravin as Brenda and Vinessa Shaw as Lynn. And Aja's style was clearly evident, in comparison to HIGH TENSION. Like the time inconsistencies and graphic murder, and the cool camera work he does. Little heavy on the CGI when it came to the mutants but they still looked good.Overall I thoroughly enjoyed THE HILLS HAVE EYES, I've probably seen it about 5 times now. But it fails in comparison to the original and Aja's other film HIGH TENSION. Better than most of the recent crop of remakes.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Another horror re-make that outdoes the original!!!,"There are few re-makes that are better than the original, but there is a new trend on the rise; The Better Re-Make! The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, directed by Marcus Nispel, is a better version that the original, directed by Tobe Hooper, but this film makes the original Hills Have Eyes, directed by horror master Wes Craven, look like a high-school snuff project. There were a few moments where I actually jumped, something that does not usually happen to me at a horror movie, and a lot of moments where I thought what I was seeing was disgustingly cruel. Though I will say this is one of the better horror films I have seen in the last year or so, it did not have as much staying power as I expected after seeing it. The acting was a little weak and the ""mutants"" sounded goofy. However, when they stopped speaking and started terrorizing, there was nobody laughing anymore. In fact, at some point the whole theatre started clapping when one of the bad guys got butchered! How's that for fan-participation?",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
This movie will blow your mind,"There are many things one can say about a movie like this. Everybody knows that when they go to see a horror movie, they go to see a movie with little story line and a vast amount of violence. In this case, The Hills have eyes contained both. Not only were there the greusome images that everybody hoped for, but there was also a REASON to make all of the killings. The movie could make a lot of sense if you put into a real life conflict. Although the PEOPLE would probably not kill just for the ufn of it, I could see a family getting stuck in the desert where they lived when the US dropped bombs and then they became mutated and got revenge.As for the storyline, the writer makes a concrete conflict between the people in the hills and everyone else.

Slick Remake,"Aja's the Hills Have Eyes retains the suspense, feeling and real horror of Wes Craven's original 1977 The Hills Have Eyes, and adds more modern characters and a bit of plot. Unlike many recent horror films, Hills develops its characters beyond stereotypes before subjecting them to grisly deaths and cannibalism, and develops suspense very well by allowing the plots to expand between gross-out scenes. The Hills also cuts very few corners in terms of graphic horror and disturbing violence, and the gore is refreshingly realistic, non-Tarantino, and unsanitary.A family is traveling across the Nevada desert near a former nuclear testing range when they need to get gas. The gas station attendant finds them annoying and decides to misdirect them into the testing range. A few clues are scattered about the early scenes from which the back-story of the plot can be deduced, but these are not to be fully understood until it becomes clear that the family is to be hunted down, sadistically murdered, and eaten - 1 by 1.Although the film vaguely connects to environmental issues and various fears concerning deformity, it appropriately avoids making any political and/or moral statements and exhibits the sort of nihilism needed for a truly scary film.The acting and the script are very good in comparison to the genre's norm. Dan Byrd was particularly impressive as Bobby Junior. the film is also well directed and the cinematography, pace and editing are a touch better than the original Craven film. All considered, this is one of the better horror films of the new millennium, so far - a little less innovative and intelligent than The Descent and a little less scary than 1408, but much more suspenseful than either.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Aja Very Well Could Be The Next Wes Craven,"With his American debut ""High Tension"", Aja definitely went where many modern-day horror films don't....he went the most violent, vicious, and animalistic route that he could to tell the story of a pshyco chopping down a family and kidnapping an innocent girl. Most would think that since his next movie, ""The Hills Have Eyes"", was all-American, the censors would have to cut his original ideals. It has been reported that the original cut was NC-17, however, that doesn't mean that this ""R""-rated version made it all the easier on the eyes.Comparing the old to the new, Wes Craven's was a very good classic horror movie. It wasn't the best, but this was only due to the fact that it was so ragged. It lacked sufficient funds and, in my personal opinion, didn't give Wes the full-range he could've used in order to make it the way he wanted. Instead, at times it felt more like a Mad Max involving a family instead of something that would seem brutal or scary. It was raw.Aja's version is much more fleshed-out with a much clearer back-story, as well as tension and suspense. The violence was similar to that of a 80's slasher with a big budget, so, if you're in it to see blood fly, this is your movie. I believe that, had Wes Craven has Aja's budget when he had his original idea back in the early 70's, the original would've been much similar to this.As a horror director, Aja is definitely on his way to becoming one of the greats. His style is defined much more in this, only adding to what we could see in ""High Tension"". He likes gore, and he shows it well.I could actually say that the remake was better than the original.To the people who liked the original better, I mean no disrespect. This is only my opinion.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
top film,"The Hills have eyes..another potential cult classic from Wes Craven.The most striking feature of all to me is it seems to be a comment on the politics of the USA rather than a straight forward slasher flick.The main protagonist, Doug is a democrat and general Left wing looker. He sticks out like a sore thumb with the overtly traditional structure of the Carter family. Many references are made to manliness by the patriarchal figure. In the plot there are many clues given to the director's political opinions. Sutble references are given in the use of guns, dope smoking and the backdrop to the nuclear victims homes. In the opening scenes a mismatch of imagery is presented perhaps suggestive criticism of politics of the past.I am trying very hard not to give plot details away but there is a sense of unending in the final scene. However a conclusion is drawn to the politics of the under plot. The final scene suggests an optimism in youth of today and the freedom of choice when it comes to defining what a family is.But thats all politics!The film deserves much credit for the unbelievable camera angles. They really create a sense of creeping up, dread is approaching. The scenery itself is breath taking, remote and desolate.go see!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

There are also multiple killings that were so over the top in showing everything.I was ready to walk out after the first 30 min. of the movie. I would have but I was with people. So the rest of the movie I really just tuned out. Many people at the movie left and never returned.I don't advise you to see this movie. You leave feeling as though you are going to be sick and if your anything like me you will have wished you spent your money on something else. So my advise is if you want to see it wait until it comes out of video that way you don't waste so much money and you turn it off any time you want.I think I can honestly say this was the worst movie I have ever watched. Save your time and skip this one.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Deep in the Heart of New Mexico,"I saw the original The Hills Have Eyes - a compelling, stunning, morally bereft film by a then Wes Craven dedicated to showing the baser side of humanity on film. A chore he did surprisingly well. I knew what to expect from a remake from his 1977 film about a family of cannibals living in the New Mexico desert preying on any interlopers that might make their way through their territory. I was surprised; however, that the remake was done with so much care and attention to detail as to not just make a hasty remake but a homage to Craven's film as well. The Hills Have Eyes through its first 2/3rds is as compelling, tense, taut, relentless as the original but with greater character development. The acting in this movie was really quite good with Ted Levine standing out as the patriarch of a family going west in a huge camper with two dogs(and a couple of lovebirds). Levine is one of those actors that just has a presence about him and a believability to any character he creates. The rest of the cast does well in their roles despite being asked to undergo some major character transformations. Director Alexandre Aja shows he knows how to use a camera and I loved the location shots in Morrocco so convincingly used as the Sout-West American desert. As I earlier stated, the first 2/3rds of the film are gold(gold, Jerry!) The last 3rd, at least for me, lacks that same kind of tension as we start to get a reason WHY the cannibals are in the desert to begin with - and though I think it is a nice attempt at some kind of explanation, I just did not find it very credible. That being said, the way it was set and the look were nonetheless impressive. The remake of Craven's original film is a gory, at times very unpleasant film which has the ability to do what so few sequels do today - stand on its own feet to some extent as a movie worth seeing in its own right.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Crossed a Line,"I really think Hollywood can and does go too far at times in history and they do need to be pulled back, shaken, and have their asses kicked. This movie is a glaring example of this. Lucky for me, I was warned about this movie from friends who saw it. It saved me from making a financial contribution to this kind of dangerous propaganda. It is by far Hollywood's most literal promotion of death and violence against the American family to date. There is absolutely no redeeming artistic or social value to this film. Yes there are a lot of really messed up people in this world. They see little or nothing at all wrong with this kind of ""entertainment"". All you have to do is turn on the news to know there are really sick people out there. Have you paid any attention to the news lately? The bottom line is films CAN influence people who are already unhinged into desiring to commit unspeakably horrible acts of harm on others. This film is definitely one of them. It crosses the line and makes sane mentally healthy people shudder to think of what ideas it may be giving some unstable, emotionally disturbed people out there. A film like this is adding gasoline to the fire. I can't imagine how those responsible for the making of this film can sleep at night. I guess its easy when you don't have a soul and want to make easy money. This film should be destroyed and all copies burned in effigy.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good action and suspense, poor character development.","I'll keep this quick and to the point. If you like gore and suspense, good. If you like character development and likable characters, then you are out of luck. The suspense build-up is long, but I think worth it in most respects. However, you must get through all this suspense with the long winded conversations that don't make you connect to, or care about the characters. I felt no empathy for these people. It seems like dialog for the sake of dialog. If you want to see a lot of 'disturbing' images in an easy to follow and decent plot you've come to the right place.Still worth watching if you like the genre.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A good story, but disconcerting","Overall this wasn't a bad movie. The premise was decent, and the adversaries were scary but amusing. I enjoyed the way the mutants interacted with each other, such as during the rape scene, when Pluto tried to argue that Lizard would be unable to commit the act. Big Brain's speech seemed to leave me almost feeling sorry for the creatures, which is uncommon in horror films.One thing that bothered me however is that the characters are given guns, and yet they can't seem to use them. It was sad to see the dad, who was apparently a cop, blatantly wasting ammo without actually acquiring a target. This would be someone who has been trained to keep cool in tense situations.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
These hills have more than just eyes........,"Few horror movie remakes can surpass the standard set by the original film it was based on. Fewer still can manage to craft a story that balances believable characters, intrigue, suspense and genuine horror. The Hills Have Eyes 2006 by Alexander Aja is a remake of the 1977 Wes Craven classic which does just that.After an adrenaline charged and intriguing(not to mention graphically violent) opening sequence involving the murders of some men in HAZMAT suits, we go into the story proper which follows a unsuspecting family, the Carters, who are tricked into taking a short cut through the desert and ambushed by a clan of mutated cannibals(These mutants were the result of nuclear testing conducted in the 40s ).Now here was a horror movie in which i actually grew to like the main characters. The Carter family, consisting of middle age Ethel and Bob along with their son Bobby, teenage daughter Brenda and eldest daughter Lynn with her husband Doug and their baby Catherine, is played with such earnestness and believability that it is really easy for anyone to relate to them and connect with them emotionally. This emotional connection made the Carter family's tragedy a whole lot sadder and scarier.Alexander Aja and Gr√©gory Levasseur manages to add a lot of depth to the characters particularly Doug; his development throughout the film from a spineless pacifist husband picked on by his father in-law to a reluctant hero pushed to the limits to save his family is handled very well be believably. The acting is adequate and serves to heighten to realism of the film.I applaud the decision to limit exposure of the mutant cannibals. It serves to make them scarier when they are only partially exposed in shadows. When we do finally get to see them in full view, they look shockingly hideous thanks to some really creative make-up and prosthetics. I also liked how unlike usual horror/slasher shows, these malformed misfits are not dim-witted, dull brutes but are as clever as regular human beings(they coordinate their attacks via walkie talkie for heavens sake!)Like most other horror movie remakes of recent years, The Hills have eyes revels in its bloody gory violence. Alexander Aja's unabashed camera shots allow all the kills and spills to be viewed in full bloody glory. A sure-fire way to please any slasher movie fan.Arguably one of the better horror movie remakes around, The Hills Have Eyes 2006 manages to not only keep faithful to the original story, but surpasses it in many aspects. For those who think horror movie remakes are a waste of time, this movie would change your mind. It is an impressive little piece of work that manages to to be genuinely scary while delivering a well plotted story with some intense action and visceral bloodletting.Horror movie fans should not miss this and even the casual movie goer would grow to like it if he/she could stand the gore.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
This Is Your Remake On STEROIDS!!!,"French horror film tyro Alexandre Aja and his production partner Gregory Levasseur just missed giving us a modern-day nightmarish classic by THIS much, with 2003's all-out assault on the senses, HIGH TENSION. It made a great calling card for the duo, combining the balls-to-the-wall sensibility of Seventies grindhouse cinema with a post-modern vibe tinged with the angst and anxiety of a world that seems to be getting a little more out of control every day. From the first twenty minutes of that film, I knew I would be a devoted fan of these new, daring filmmakers.But then they tacked on an ending that would've made me reach for an air sickness bag if theaters stocked them, because it seemed to be so jarringly, unexpectedly implausible, misogynistic and just plain STUPID. I sincerely believed that they could never redeem themselves as far as I was concerned.Fast-forward to three years later, after horror legend Wes Craven handpicked Aja and Levasseur to redo his early drive-in favorite, THE HILLS HAVE EYES. By this time, I was absolutely an anti-fan of remakes of any kind. As a rule, most Hollywood remakes and ""reimaginings"" of classic films have now managed to live down to the lowest of my expectations. Unlike some really well-done examples from back in the Eighties - Cronenberg's THE FLY, Abel Ferarra's BODY SNATCHERS and Chuck Russell's THE BLOB just to name a few - remakes now seemed to be a miserable excuse for some bloated Hollywood suit to command that a beautifully crafted original be stuffed into an effects-laden, badly scripted and acted, PG-13 rated pale imitation of its former self, just to make some ready cash off its ravaged carcass.I had no hopes at all that this incarnation of THHE would be any different. None. Even though the preview trailers were well-done, it seems that anybody can make fantastic trailers for craptastic films. And with Aja and Levasseur as creators of this new version, I figured that just like with HIGH TENSION, the croissants would surely hit the fan like before.Happily, for the most part, I'm glad to say I was wrong.Classic fright film purists who would ""fart in this movie's general direction"" should give it the benefit of the doubt first. The new script not only remains basically faithful to the original premise, but the manner in which the original film established a reputation for being the second most brutal film Craven ever made for its decade, still holds true with this version for our own times.Every aspect of the original story is amped up, with a few scary pluses added. Where the former THHE presented a mutant clan that lived in the desert hills with very little explanation for how they got there, Aja and Levasseur plays upon the deepest musings of your most morbid outdoor fantasies with a ""what-if"" scenario that adds government-sanctioned nuclear testing and the usual bureaucratic screwing-up and screwing-over the ""little guys"" to give the marginal plausibility a little goosebump-y kick. If you've ever stood in the desert during an off-road trip and gazed at the forbidding hills, wondering what in the hell might be out there besides coyotes and scorpions, this movie provides a gut-churning possible answer.The best advisory I can provide regarding the violence is that those without ""hard-R""-rated constitutions should stay far, far away. The effects work and action sequences here make Craven's original seem almost quaint. And the acting here is more than adequate from the ensemble cast, even if some of the character arcs in the script become a little less than convincing.I just want to say in closing that I have gained a new respect for director Aja's talents. I still haven't found it in myself to bestow full trust in him after the HIGH TENSION debacle, but the new THHE is certainly a big step in the right direction; not only for him, but for millennial remakes in general.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
NOT a good movie to wake up to,"Though I have not seen the original 1977 film, I cannot help but agree with some of the positive comments about this film, especially those regarding the engrossing use of character development and violence to captivate the viewer. Rather than rehash what has already been said, I would like to share my personal experience with this film with you.I began watching this film at midnight on cable. At one point, I fell asleep due to personal exhaustion. Not too long later, I awoke to my television blaring the screams and shrieks of the victims in the film. I woke up at what is clearly the most vile, raunchy, and disturbing point of the film. I am a 27 year old male. I love to show gory movies to my girlfriend and friends and creep up on them when they're not suspecting it. Still, I was completely taken aback, appalled, slightly sickened, and disturbed by what I awoke to. Clearly unable to fall back asleep, I HAD to keep watching to see the film's resolution (if any).This is the power inherent in good film making; to reel the viewer in with character development and then manipulate the viewer's emotions by doing wretched things to those characters.This is by no means the greatest or scariest horror film, but I found it to be far more enthralling and captivating than any recent teen slasher or pseudo-scary Ring-type movie.I haven't had this much fun being appalled in years!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Where were the scary parts? the parts that made you jump and get goosebumps? this movie had nothing to offer. And as far as the gore throughout it...It got tiresome to watch after a while.

"very disturbing at some points, but pretty good","This movie was very much like the movie ""Wrong Turn,"" about a group of campers getting lost in the woods and chased by inbred, cannibalistic mountain men. But it was a pretty good movie, although some parts were pretty disturbing. It also has that ""revenge"" factor, where the victims are able to get even with their attackers which sort of helps the audience better deal with all the stuff that happens to the family. The story in general is also pretty interesting in that its actually somewhat believable (the fact that the miners and their families in that area were effected by the nuclear testing going on.) Pretty cool special effects too. In my opinion, it wont win any awards, but its worth seeing",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bad taste (may contain spoilers),"I normally give movies more then a one but this movie really upset me. I like horror movies and even gore does not bother me. The movie was good up until the rape scene. I thought that was just over the line. That scene just ruined the entire movie for me, it was the only scene that kept playing in my head. It really bothered me, and still does. Also, the end was very predictable. I did not see the original so I have no idea if that one ends the same way. I just wish a good horror movie with an actual GOOD plot would come out. Directors just seem to be in a slump with these cheesy horror flicks, The Grudge, The Ring, and now The Hills Have Eyes. I would not recommend this movie to ANYONE. I think it is tasteless and one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Comparisons to the ""Original""","Viewers will be happy to know that the remake of 1977's ""The Hills Have Eyes"" maintains the hokey fake binocular point of view device. Ever notice how those two circles with the black borders used for movie POV purposes are not what you actually see when you look through a pair of binoculars (there are no circles in there).I had the luxury of watching the two films at the same time. I would run 15 minutes of the remake first and then she same15 minutes of the original. Roger Ebert contends that it is a loose re-make; I disagreed until well past the midway point of the story. Until then it pretty much followed things scene for scene, with minor updates to reflect 2006 rather than 1977. The bill for a tank of gas was under $10 in the original.They chose to alter the back-story; in the original the gas station owner had spawned the original creature back before WWII and he tries to persuade the family to stay on the main road. In the remake the creatures are products of atomic testing and the gas station owner is paid by them to divert people off the main road. The introduction of the old atomic testing device allows the production design people to create a government built fake town left over from the testing. It is populated with old mannequins originally placed there to show the effects of a nuclear blast. This set is a nice addition to the original and the biggest deviation or the remake.Not so effective is a ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" field of abandoned cars and trucks (belonging to prior victims); mostly because the device has become almost obligatory to these familial horror stories (insert ""Wrong Turn"" here). In the original this was an off camera Air Force dump site from which the son-in-law salvaged some equipment. Making this a textbook example of why showing nothing is sometimes better showing something.My reaction until well after the midpoint was that the remake was better. It was very respectful of original and the higher budget and technical improvements meant better film stock, more elaborate camera work, and better audio. Neither cast is exactly full of heavyweight talent. The new higher budgeted group might actually be more talented but Craven is a much better acting for the camera director than Aja; so the acting advantage clearly goes to the original (who also seemed to be having a lot more fun with their material).The remake falters (relative to the original anyway) for the last third of the film. In large part this is because Aja failed early on to define and adequately develop personalities for the mutant family. This was the real strength of the original as the family in the hills was quickly identified and their internal relationships developed. They took a gleeful pleasure in their mayhem and Craven kept them in character throughout the production. The remake is inconsistent, at times it tries to make them more sympathetic and at other times more primitive and savage. Plus it adds a non-ambulatory character like that in ""TCM"" and ""Monster Man"". Unfortunately here he serves no purpose other than as an excuse to employ more people in the make-up unit.Finally, the remake lacks the original's best visual image, Michael Berryman's hairless asymmetrical head which was featured on the poster and video cover art. Berrymore's characterization of ""Pluto"" became a cult figure with his groveling and whining. Michael Bailey Smith's new ""Pluto"" does not begin to measure up to Berryman's. The remake's best visual image is a superior ""Ruby""; Laura Ortiz manages an expressive performance that is both wistful and eerie-nice job.It appears that Aja incorporated parallels between the two families but few will notice and even less will care. I say ""appears"" because somewhere between production and release this stuff was so haphazardly assembled that it lost all sense of unity and purpose.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pretty decent horror flick,"Having never seen the original movie, I didn't really know what to expect from this new version. But I have to say that this is a horror movie that will send most people home happy.The first half hour or so is a little slow, building up the story and, to a certain extent, the characters. Although horrors aren't exactly known for strong characters. Eventually after around 30 minutes or so it all kicks off and we're bang in horror country as knives, guns and pickaxes are used in a bloodbath between good and evil.The acting is decent throughout the film, even if there aren't any stand-out performances, but then again you don't expect Oscar winning performances in a gory horror. There are some problems though, such as some characters suddenly being killed off before we barely know who they are. As well as that there are some moments early on where the family don't really seem to realise the situation (being stranded in the middle of nowhere) they are in. And God knows what the old guy is on about at the gas station, his part in the film is never really explained properly. But these are all minor nitpicks as the action more than makes up for the minor plot and character flaws.So overall, an above average horror movie, which has a likeness to 'Wrong Turn'.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Brutal,savage and unrelenting - the way horror film should be.","A family on their way to California come across a rundown gas station in the middle of the New Mexico desert.They then think they're taking a shortcut through the hills,thanks to the kindly suggestion of the gas attendant,but find themselves stranded in the middle of no where.And to make things worse,the whole thing was a trap so a group of deformed mutants can butcher and eat them.""The Hills Have Eyes"" remake was made by Alexandre Aja,the guy behind ""Haute Tension"".It offers plenty of nasty violence and gore,several scenes with nail-biting tension and a few solid scares.One of the most radical departures from Wes Craven's original is to give the cannibals back-stories.In the 2006 movie,they are miners who were deformed by the radiation fallout from 1940s and 1950s nuclear testing.The trailer attack sequence is wonderfully audacious and the violence is brutal and bloody.Aja manages to unsettle the viewer few times,such as when he intercuts the burning alive of the family matriarch Bob with the suggested rape of younger daughter Brenda.The mutant and gore effects by Howard Berger and Gregory Nicotero are excellent and the photography of the desert landscape is great.A must-see for fans of intense survival horror!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The Hills Have Eyes grounds itself in mounds of blood, gore and mutant carnage.","The last decade embellished in horror remakes, some absolutely abysmal that shan't be discussed whilst others were just rolling around in mediocrity like a pig in mud. Aja's remake of Craven's original mutant bash is surprisingly well-fitting despite some tendencies that cause characters to make impeccably stupid choices. Hills were present, and deformed eyes were glaring down at tourists with a palpable sense of blood-thirsty dread. Delicious. A family embarking on a road trip get lost in the middle of a New Mexico desert. With their car mysteriously damaged, they are unable to go anywhere.Enter the irradiated miners to cause terror, steal babies and illicit some uncalled promiscuity in the form of rape. Most family members, notably the father, son and sister's boyfriend, have a suitable amount of personality that make their characters worth investing in. After all, this is a horror dealing with an ever-growing list of expendable cast members, so to inject some attachment to them made the obnoxious jump scares and ridiculously dumb character choices tolerable. Individuals splitting up doing their own thing without thinking is a precedent in this remake, allowing the mutants to prowl the hills and hunt them down. Speaking of murdering primitives, Aja intelligently shows us glimpses of them initially in order to crank up the tension. Unfortunately he does not maintain that for much longer. As soon as he shows them in the glorious moonlight, the mystery and suspense dissipates immediately with most of the mutants coming across as basic.Let's be honest though, you came for the gore. And my word, you got it! Shotgun to the head, pickaxe to the eye and the heroic pet dog Beast ripping throats out like it's his day job. Exceptional work in the makeup department, no question. This is by far one of the better remakes from the naughties. Whilst I do take issue with some characters, directorial choices and the lethargic ending, these hills were a pleasant (if you can say that) re-visit.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Terrible movie and hilarious/Cannot be taken seriously.,"With a full theater of people watching, I embarked on my journey through The Hills Have Eyes. Little did I know how much fun I would have.The movie is awful. Just completely and totally awful. I didn't care about the characters and even wanted the baby to die. The characters in the movie are so stupid that a lot of your time will be spent cheering when someone is killed or screaming at the screen, telling the character how stupid they are.Every single person in the packed theater was laughing at the movie and mocking it repeatedly.During one point when the character brandishes a shotgun like I club, I felt compelled to yell out ""There are bullets in the gun, asshole."" Many people found this funny and even more people screamed something similar at the exact same moment.I really...really can't say anything else. The movie is a Must-See because of how completely awful and terrible it is.

With inventive and creative use of the original script this makes one very good film. The addition of the nuclear theme over the original, and weak, freak theme is excellent.

If like me you not really a horror buff, you just like a good film that takes you out of yourself, then you won't go wrong with this one.A word of warning though, it is not for the faint hearted.

Since the family are on their way to California. This family gets stranded in the middle of nowhere and not thinking, they are near an old nuclear test site. An strange group of Bloodthirshy monsters are watching them from the hills and these monsters are planning their attack on this wholesome family.Directed by Alexandre Aja made an effective, strong brutal horror movie. Which is based on a 1977 film, written and directed by Wes Craven (The Last House on the Left, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream Trilogy). Co-Screenwriter/Director:Aja and Art Director/Co-Screenwriter:Gregory Lavasseur (Who also co-wrote ""High Tension"") made this remake with more irony, emotional and violent than Craven's take on his original movie. In this new remakes focuses on a nuclear waste subplot, a different third act and making the villains more mysterious, creeper & open minded. The only thing i felt missing watching this remake is Craven's (sometimes outrageous) dark sense of humour in the original. Oddly enough Aja and Lavasseur made this villains a bit more sympathetic. Because this remake, they made these monsters victims themselves by the nuclear test site. Which of course, the big differences between the original and the remake. In the original, these attackers were inbred cannibals living near an old nuclear test site. In the remake, they become monsters by being deformed by the test site turning into cannibals themselves and living at a old test site.This remake is actually (only sightly) better than Craven's movie. This remake has top production values by having excellent cinematography work by Maxime Alexandre, a surprisingly good cast (including:Robert Joy as Lizard, Micheal Bailey Smith as Pluto, Laura Ortiz as Ruby and Billy Drago as Papa Jupiter), great production designs by Joseph Nemic the Third (Terminator 2:Judgment Day), convincing make-up effects work by Gregory Nicotero and Oscar-Winner:Howard Berger (The Chronicles of Nadia:the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Hostel, Land of the Dead) and sometimes brilliant music score by tomandandy (The Rules of Attraction). Like Craven's original, this remake is also flawed in parts. Especially in some of its dramatic moments and towards the conclusion.The Unrated DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The DVD has two informative commentary tracks. Commentary One is the Co-Screenwriter/Director:Aja, Art Director/Co-Screenwriter:Lavasseur and One of the film's producers:Marianne Maddalena (Cursed, Music of the Heart, Red Eye). The Second Commentary is by the producers:Craven and Peter Locke (The original producer of the 1977 picture) is actually a bit more entertaining and fun than the first commentary track. DVD also has a terrific 50 minute documentary, production diaries and a music video. Only two things missing are the excellent theatrical trailer and deleted scenes (Which it was briefly seen in the documentary).The new ""Hills"" is one of the best horror remakes in a while. Like Craven's original film, this remake will also have an cult following. Since this remake was a sleeper hit at the box office and did well on DVD. There's no doubt the producers:Craven, Maddalena and Locke are working on the upcoming sequel. Let's hope the sequel will not be a remake of the absurd second ""Hills"" 1983 movie. Which Craven and Locke were also involved in. Super 35. (****/*****).",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
great old bloody entertainment,"for everyone who complained on how sick and brutal this movie was. why did you see it. anything that was originally rated nc-17, you could assume some crazy things were going to happen.myself thought the movie told a great story and every shot was really distuinguished and had its own feel to it. the whole horror formula gets a little boring at sometimes, but i feel that alexandre aja did a fantastic job. and i salute him for not cutting anything or shying away from using less blood to gain a bigger audience.if he decides to do the sequel, then he's got my ticket money hands down. cause what i paid for was more than what i was expecting.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

One of the least ambitious remakes ever made.,"Note for note remake of the 1977 film, as a family gets lost, stranded in the middle of the desert, preyed upon by mutant killers.Expectedly colour-saturated, high contrast horror film follows the original film so closely, and even uses strikingly similar dialogue, that it becomes entirely predictable, and it reduces the plot merely to gross- out torture-porn.The film unwisely reverses the cautionary gas station attendant and turns him into another generic ambusher, telling this family to take some unmarked dirt path, instead of staying "" on the main road "", leading them straight to the killers' traps.The killers from the original film were terrifying, with hardly any make- up effects, and they were actual characters, with personalities, and oddly likable quirks ( as demonstrated by some of their one-liners directed at each other ) , but here, the killers are just gross looking, and they have none of the personality or presence of the original's killers, having been reduced to generic, CGI, cardboard cutout killers.Oddly enough, the Nevada desert locations in the original film were haunting, prehistoric, unearthly looking, but the Ouarzazate desert landscape in this film looks like just that: a desert. Completely lacking the atmosphere in setting.This remake does have its moments, just not enough of them. Best scene: Doug ( whose character endures enough injuries to kill several people ) discovering the nuclear blast crater.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Stunned. Gripped. Scared shitless.,"Stunned. Gripped. Scared shitless.I was -- when watching Alexandre Aja's excellent remake of the 1977 Wes Craven slasher on a preview screening.If Craven's film is considered a classic, then this new version is an instant classic of artistic integrity, unique frights, and brutal honesty.Aja is a great guy, and truly a visual poet -- still, his first gorefest ""High Tension"" (aka ""Switchblade Romance"") was a hysteric movie looking for an actual plot line.Since then, Aja has grown into his task, with a simple, effective script for ""The Hills Have Eyes"" remake, which combines the best of both ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Dawn of Dead"", my two favorite slasher remakes in recent years.I can't wait to see Aja's next film, the appropriately titled ""The Waiting.""

A Trip Gone Wrong,"""The Hills Have Eyes"" features a small family that goes on an incredible trip that suddenly became a living hell. Such was the same unfortunate fate of the movie itself. The movie had potential to be a great thriller, but slowly faded into a world of horror movie clich√©s and improbable situations.A small area in New Mexico was designated a nuclear testing site. However a family of miners refused to leave the area. The result: a generation of deformed beings with a strong resentment to the rest of the human race.This movie tells the story of a small family on their way to San Diego. The movie was successful in establishing the family as a relatable and likable group of people. There is a retired cop father, a loving mother who was once a 60's hippie, their oldest daughter along with her baby and husband (the son-in-law looking for the approval of the in-laws), the adorable adolescents Bobbie and Brenda, and their lovable canines Beauty and Beast. Aww how cute.Little do they know, they are driving directly into the clutches of another family that is not so lovable. A group of deranged individuals, physically and mentally, who not only rob from the passing tourists, but mutilate them, and of course, the inevitable tendency for deranged families in horror films to indulge in the delicacy of cannibalism.The film was good in setting the atmosphere for the different families and in turning up the suspense and tension when the two collide. In the beginning, you surprisingly care for the tourist family and hope they make it out alive. But as the events transpire, and the family begins to make stupid decisions, and the deformed family begin to make stupider ones, the emotional content of the film is lost, including any hint of compassion and even, unfortunately, fear.There were a few walkouts in the theater when I watched it opening night, but i couldn't tell if they were due to the graphic content, or the unsatisfactory film-making. There are moments of great suspense and a phenomenal makeup job on the Texas Chainsaw-like ensemble. But seriously, when are victims in movies going to learn never to leave each other alone and follow unfamiliar noises? And when will cannibalistic families learn to eat 'em when you get the chance, instead of waiting around and giving your dinner that final opportunity to get away?For what it's worth, this was a decent attempt, and the movie is good enough for a rental. But when it comes down to it, I'd rather spend a night in those hills than a night with the crazy truck driver in Harold and Kumar. ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is not so much a horror film as it is an instructional video for what not to do when going on a cross-country road trip. Never trust gas attendants. Unless its a Shell.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wow.,"Wow. This movie is phenomenal. This is how movie remakes should definitely be done!!! Aja is... wow... he's so good. So the movie starts off with the Carters going on a trip to California. They want to find out if there is a shortcut so they stop at a gas station and ask for directions. The merchant tells them to follow a certain road, they do. The road to hell...So, anyway. They are on the road and don't see the spikes on the road. Their wheels get severed, but luckily they have a trailer home. They decide to wait it out. I don't want to say anything else. But this is when it gets really intense. I do admit, the pacing was a little to fast for the scenes to come, but nonetheless, it was well done! This movie made me feel things I've never felt. Claustrophobia, Anxiety, Suspense, Dread, Aw. I shuddered at some of the scenes. There was some drama in the movie, which helps the audience catch its breath, but right after we go back in to another fright-fest. The characters are well developed, so, that you actually care for them. People were clapping when some of the scenes were going on because it was so intense! Wow. Great job Aja, also kudos to the makeup!!! well done! This movie sets a high mark for all the upcoming remakes that will be done. Great movie! 9/10 on my list.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Hills Have Eyes (8/10),"Director Alexandra Aja had a lot riding on his own Hills Have Eyes film and he certainly did not ruin his rep by remaking this film. In the grand scheme of the horror genre, Aja's Hills Have Eyes is one of the best remakes out there. It was true to the original with a very similar plot but it added some different twist and cool scenes along the way. The town scene, which is a unique idea to the nuclear subplot, is very gory and tense. One negative thing compared to the original is how deformed the mutants are. The mutants are too unrealistic looking, with no distinguishable features, the original gave a way better image. Also, the last five seconds is a big let-down, it's low class sometimes how horror movies try to make it interesting and set itself up for a sequel. Still, the 2006 modern version of The Hills Have Eyes is a big hit and one of the better horror films of that decade.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

a very fine remake,"""The Hills Have Eyes"" (2006) has to be one of the finest remakes I have ever seen (my personal opinion). I know the original film well and it has long been a favourite of mine. The story line of the 2006 version is the same as the 1977 version - even the cast look like the original cast - but the new filmmakers brought something new to the story. I won't spoil the movie for those of you who have not yet seen it, but let me say this, the additions in the remake are great. The new aspects of the story, the sub plot and back-story, really enhance the picture and gives the fans of the movie much more to think about - it's more exciting and much scarier. Could even say it's more believable this time round (okay, maybe not believable but definitely more thought provoking along the lines of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre). In short this is the best example of a remake - the original was very good, but this was far better, it built on the original film (even had the look shot for shot in some places) and then took it to the next height, whilst skilfully remaining faithful to the original story and never veering away on it's own tangent. I thoroughly recommend this film - I love it. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
This Film will leave you Disturbed,"Aka remakes Wes Craven's classic the Hills Have Eyes. I thought this was going to be another gore fest which was going to suck though I was really wrong about that.I saw the Hills Have Eyes (1977) & (2006) both on the same day and I'd have to say the Original is better, though the Remake catches on very well because I find the Remake more of a disturbing film.This remake keeps with the same plot as there is an American family riding in the desert and their car breaks down and then after that, blood-thirsty Mutants come and stalk them and then end up killing most of them.This remake did an excellent job at leaving you scared shitless, I know I was after watching it. Especially the rape scene, my god that was disturbing. Usually remakes are never scary nor Disturbing but this one did a terrific job at it.Though like always this remake has a downfall for being bloody. I'm glad that they didn't make it gory cause that would've ruined the film and most remakes with gore usually don't turn out the best.I can't really complain about this remake because it was a very creepy, stalking one. The atmosphere was chilling, the villains where different which was quite a change and entire plot does have a more darker side.I suggest you watch this film because you'll like it. This film will honestly leave you Disturbed for days and that is a great thing. That is what Horror films are meant to do.

Alexandre Aja gets it right,"A remake of the 1977 film by Wes Craven with the same name.A family on their way to California go through a remote portion of the New Mexico desert in effort to cut down on travel time. When they have an accident (that's not really an accident) and get stuck out there in the middle of nowhere they realize that they are not alone. A group of people living out in the desert that has fallen victim to radioactive mutation starts to terrorize them.Unlike the original Aja keeps a strong focus on atmosphere and keeping certain key things shrouded in darkness or off frame until the opportune moment for a shock comes along. That is really the main difference in this version from the original and it works to great effect. The original gave the mutant way too much screen time and that took away much of the horror and the atmosphere become more uncomfortable rather than scary. He not only is the atmosphere eerie, even though much of the film takes place during day, but the visceral shock is also much more intense. Featuring a good use of computer and prosthetic effect seamlessly blended together this film provides some of the best visceral horror around anywhere. Alexandre Aja is a good path to becoming a horror master now that he has both 'High Tension' and this film on his short, but impressive, resume.One slightly annoying thing in this version, that wasn't in the original, is the opening scene. In 'Hills 1977' Wes Craven just got right down to business and showed an eerie shot of the desert at twilight. Here we get an admittedly shocking, but kind of generic horror film opening with a few nameless victims getting done in. How many times since 'Jaws' has that been done? But it really doesn't matter, since it is a good set up for the intensity that will come at you full force later in the film. 8/10DVD release is unrated and contains intense brutal violence/gore, a rape scene, and profanity",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Another remake; another yawn; another out-of-work screenwriter in Hollywood...,"I was really psyched about a remake of the original Hills. However, the 5% of changes made were unoriginal and pretentious. Much of the script is copied and pasted, line for line (which is somewhat obnoxious because there were setups in the dialogue that don't pay off here... like several mentions of rattlesnakes). The car/trailer showdown is not as creative as the original (lacking the body bait and the dragging sequence). The ""test village"" sequences are disjointed and fall flat (although the fight in the house is great).Despite all of its low budget cheesiness and flaws, the original is what it is: an original (and labor of love).

A scary and intense Survival Horror film,"What I'll always remember about this horror movie is how attached I became to the main characters. In most horror movies, the victims are just there to be killed in creative ways, you never really feel any emotions watching them die. In this movie, the characters felt like a real American family. You will find at least one person in the family who you will relate to. The acting is great, which adds to the intensity of seeing people who you've come to care about be attacked by savages. The final act of the movie is one huge adrenaline rush that had me cheering. There are some minor issues, that I will not mention, because they are easily overlooked.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Terrible,"Switchblade romance was already a really stupid film who treat it's audience like idiots and this remake of the Wes Craven classic if less stupid is still quite moronic. Then again it's full of incoherences, it's heavy on symbolism, then again Aja has never been known for subtlety, but if it's the case don't do,symbolism or psychology and just go plain trash! The scene with killings with the American flag doesn't make any sense : the US army is after all responsible for the mutation of the bad guys. In the original the bad guys were characters , here they're just a freak show with no depth at all. The Wes Craven was really inventive in ways of killing people, the dragging of the bad guy with a rope and a car wheel, the python scene. Here it's just violent and pointless. The end is particularly bad, Ruby sacrifices herself, she could have pushed her dad but no she's jumps with him, in the original she saves the young dad using a python, that was bad ass.The bits where the guy is holding his phone to check if there's any network is phony, especially when they do it twice , that actor for that scene only should get an award for worst actor ever .I cannot believe people think that might be a better version than the original , the make up on the villains is so bad you can actually see the plastic, it's plain awful.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

A very good horror movie,"Having recently discovered the attraction of very old horror films, I seek movies which are not simple exploitation of the word horror, such as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which in my opinion checks one's intelligence at the door. A few things attracted me to The Hills movie, one being the promotional trailer which shows a history of nuclear testing. So it's not completely out of the realm of possibility, as there is a historical precedence, which is clearly illustrated. This is not an entirely predictable movie. Too many movies are, which detracts from their quality. What I did successfully predict paled in comparison to the shocks I received. My companion had to look away from the screen a few times.

"vile, depraved, depressing filth","this film gets the two rating only because of the technical excellence of the cinematographers and the editors.the original Hills Have Eyes was an exercise in tedium, and this remake speeds up the pace at the expense of making a proper film.to be honest, i have no problem with the current trend of remaking ""classic"" horrors, as they often tend to produce some interesting watching. the remake of ""Texas Chain Saw"", for instance, provided a film that was as entertaining as the original was innovative. but this is nothing more than open pornography in its truest form.it's hard to understand what this film wants to be. there are no true ""scare"" or shock scenes, just acts of violence that one tends to find repulsive, unless they are the proud owner of a diseased mind. there is no element of suspense of fear at any stage, so it is difficult to say it is a true horror film as such. as a thriller it is a bit of a dead-weight as the twists are obvious, and as some sort of revisionist dark comedy it fails to give a laugh.a deeply unpleasant film with no redeeming content. film students may want to look at it for the production aspects which, as mentioned, are rather flattering for this film. otherwise, when you are at the video store, you could rent practically any other movie available and have by far a more enjoyable evening. do not willingly put yourself through this trash.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

Disgusting and unnecessary film that offers nothing bar that adrenaline kick once the pain causers get their comeuppance.,"Yes, it's one of those films that's so gruesome and nasty you're either going to enjoy it and love it for its pure, out and out effectiveness or hate it for the exact same reason. Horror as a genre has that ability, like comedy, to produce content some will take to but others will not. The Hills Have Eyes to some will be a thrill ride of adrenaline and eventual retribution played out in glorious, grimy, grungy cinematography; to others it'll be a freak show with few redeeming features. Truth is, the film is more of a freak show with few redeeming features than it is an intelligent and interesting exercise in horror but comes complete with daft metaphors and ill logic at times.The original was made at a time when the genre was on the cusp of a wave. 1972's Deliverance and 1974's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre helped launch the idea of out-of-towners stranded, lost and helpless in a wilderness unbeknownst to them. Wes Craven's 1977 version was about a family getting stranded right where they didn't want to be and the 2006 remake is a similar set up: place the pigeons exactly where you want them and unleash the cats.The trouble is The Hills Have Eyes is just this followed by an orgy of buckets of blood, violence and disturbance. It's not like Deliverance or Hooper's 'Chainsaw' movie in the sense it doesn't incorporate the location as a third element to the character's survival (as the forests of Deliverance did) but merely renders the desert in which it's set a large, open space people must take ages in travelling through. Additionally, it lacks the sense of danger Hopper's 'Texas Chainsaw' had, which gave us a fair amount of suspense and disturbance in equal measure, as seen in the dinner table scene nearer the end and the chase through the woods/country house prior to that. The Hills Have Eyes ignores elements of chase and setting up a potentially nasty encounter and skips straight to the shock and horror of it all.The film begins with a montage of nuclear weapons being tested which immediately reminded me of the opening of 1998's Godzilla, but it is as much about nuclear testing and makes about as much-a statement on nuclear testing as Godzilla did, which is zilch. Once the set up has been done and a gas station attendant has an attacks of morals, the film gets going; descending into its messy and needlessly unpleasant procession. Throughout the course of the film, we will get to see loved one's watch their other loved ones burnt to death whilst being alive the whole time. We will also get to see someone else being raped in front of the family members, also watching on, and in clear, obvious un-comfort ‚Äì is this supposed to be entertaining? Is this the level these action/horror hybrids have sunk to?But the film isn't just a series of scenes in which we get to see harmless, innocent people suffer at the hands of creatures that get no introduction bar a nuclear testing montage and a small title paragraph of information. The film is about a band of Americans; a band of Americans in a desert locale getting horribly picked off one by one by an enemy they have no clue to either: how to defeat at first; where they are coming from or what they even are. Parallels could be read into to do with the Iraq war or general conflict in the middle east and it may well be that people look back at this film in years to come as some sort of parallel to these events.Talking of the location being a large and wide open space that bamboozles and forces the family to cover large distances, why is it that the mutants whom eventually show themselves are able to negotiate and hide within the canyons whenever the family try to intercept or chase them down? Some of the more would-be humbling scenes such as one family member discovering a graveyard of previous victims' cars have been done before, recently in a film entitled Wrong Turn so the impact does not hit you like the makers want it to and thus, it comes off as uninspiring and flat.I think The Hills Have Eyes is supposed to be a thrill-a-minute, action film that entertains and scares in equal measure but it's more of one, long sick procession of gore and unpleasantness that nobody needs to see ‚Äì was there a point to all of this? Even more-so, was there a point of remaking the original? One element of real distaste arrives in the form of a young female character who sunbathes in a bikini, is provocatively shot and states she'd ""rather be in Cancun"" ‚Äì it's clear the audience is supposed to be attracted to her since she's shot accordingly so. It is when that character is raped later on that we get to see possible repressed fantasies the film embedded within our psyche earlier on, getting played out. Like this tiny element and the Iraq war situation acting as a metaphorical backdrop, the film is needless and unpleasant thus allowing most people to come away from the film thinking they've seen something brilliant, purely because they've been taken on a roller-coaster of thrills, spills and surging hormones ‚Äì what a shame.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

"In a word: Garbage, in two: Absolute Garbage","I am a horror film fan. I have enjoyed films that may be perceived by some to be on the same basic level as this film such as The Devil's Rejects for instance. But using that film as my bases for comparison, this is nothing but splatter porn. At least Devil's Rejects gave us a bit of a story; with antagonists who exist in and outside of the horrific world they've created. These ""mutants"" exist only to torture and to move quickly in front of cameras to make them seem scary from the audience's point of view as most of the movements in those types of shots are not necessary unless you happen to be filming them. I don't know what I wanted out of this film, as I did not enjoy Craven's original, yet this still managed to somehow disappoint me. Absolute garbage.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Lots of Gore with plenty more,"Good ole Wes Craven did it again !Awesome ! I finally watched the latest version of the above movie and I was totally happy with it. The story stuck directly to-the- point and never once wavered in the wrong direction. The acting was very-well done except for the scene midway through the movie when one of the freaks was chasing the young boy. This kid appeared earlier to have great knowledge of firearms but when he was being chased, it reminded me of a toddler with a water pistol. If these mutant rejects had just killed my family, I would be just as blood thirsty as the freaks were. All in all, If you're into suspense and horror, this movie is worth checking-out. The crew who looked after make-up, special effects, and costumes did an amazing job on the freaks. They looked authentic and a lot better then the ones in the original 1977 version. I especially liked the setting of the nuked-village with the old cars, houses, furniture, and mannequins. It got me wondering if there really are places like the one in the movie ????",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Crapola, with a CAPITAL C.","My god, I had hopes with this movie, when I saw the cover. It was a Friday, so me and my friend stacked beer, cigarettes, and chow, and eagerly put the DVD in. We finished four bottles of beer, and nothing had happened on the screen till then. Then the first ""blood-thirsty-mutant"" made her appearance. The thing looked like she'd been in a ""soft"" roadkill. How did the girl-monster acquire that face? Was she hit by a bicycle? Or did Dennis Rodman kissed her? I have no clue. Somewhere, this particular scene reminded me of I am Sam, but that is irrelevant.Then the first dog was killed by one of the monster ""thingummies"". A little while later, the other monster made his appearance. I cried copious volumes of tears when I saw him. This one looked like he'd been hit with a pan, bottom first. Anyway, he sneered and jeered at the screen till I wanted to smash my TV.And then the happy campers start getting killed, raped, and maimed. Yes, in that particular order. Then they trap a mutant and blow him to smithereens. They almost had a high-five sequence there. Then the lead guy pokes the Master-Monster in the eye and gets away with it too.In the final scene, the survivors walk away in the sunrise or sunset. I was busy pulling the last strands of hair in my armpits by then anyway, so I didn't notice.Verdict? I think a guy a guy in Ghana with a lower budget would have done a better job. This is easily THE worst movie I have ever seen. I mean, I live in India, and we have our own home-grown gore-masterpieces. But THIS movie, left me speechless.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Blood and entertainment galore,"Alex Aja (High Tension) directs a well made horror film with great finesse here...well, the scenes are anything but clean, however. There is TONS of blood in 'The Hills Have Eyes', a disturbing film about a family (Cast members are not important, but movie goers will recognize Aaron Stanford of X-Men: The Last Stand and Emilie de Ravin of Lost), a mom, dad, sisters, one brother, one sister's husband, the young couple's child, and two dogs. This family is on their way out west when the get lost, unaware that their location is also home to enraged and horrifying humans who were mutated from nuclear radiation from atomic bomb testing. And the monsters aren't too happy about having visitors.'Hills' is full of blood and gore that any horror fan will be a fan of. There is not a ton of mystery, but that is not really a factor. This is a very gruesome picture, as it contains material that no one under 17 should see, including strong and bloody gore, a scene of rape, masses of blood, people burning alive, and explosions. The film does do a great job of keeping the audience attached, which is it's best quality. The action and suspense keeps going throughout the entire film, and doesn't just stick with the normal 'crazies are attacking' plot. It actually grows into more, like a good movie should. I must add that Emilie de Ravin is a ton of fun to look at, so that was probably one thing that helped me enjoy more. The ending does leave it open for a sequel, which is great, because I can't wait to see more films like this. This film is not as scary as High Tension, but it IS better. Any horror fan will love this film, and any movie fan who can stand for the gore and blood will enjoy too. Alex Aja has done well on this one, and I look forward to watching more films of his.8/10 --spy",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Worst Horror Movie I've Seen,"This was one of the worst movies I have seen in recent memory. The plot was so cheesy and unexciting that me and my two friends could not sit there long enough to watch the entire movie (we got our money back as well). I have watched a lot of horror movies over the last ten years or so and this one was the worst. I had few elements of a good horror movie and was very predictable. There were scary moments in this movie, but they did not make up for the incredibly slow development of the plot or un-intriguing story line. The bottom line is, if you like quality slasher and horror movies then I do not recommend seeing The Hills Have Eyes.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horror movie fans!,This movie is awesome especially if you love horror movies.Usually the older ones are better.But this movie unlike all those pg 13 so called horror movies that have been coming out the last few years actually takes you where you want to go.Its got a good story line but doesn't bog you down with it boring you into submission like house of wax(first 30 minutes snooze fest).Its straight forward to the point.Its bloody like any horror movie should be!And it doesn't follow all the stereo typical horror movie rules.They are not afraid to curse which is really important in horror movies.This movie definitely stands out.If your a horror movie fan please see this movie!,9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Dumb movie,"Typically, I don't turn movies off - and I didn't with this one - hence, the 2 out 10 rating. Otherwise, it would have gotten a 1 out of 10. I was pretty close to turning it off though. I was I had because I smelled sequel at the end there. God, I hope not.This movie was really just plain dumb. While the acting wasn't too bad, I really didn't feel anything for the characters. I could care less when they were getting whacked. And that's the whole point, I think. Do I really want to sit through a movie where I have absolutely no feelings for the characters while they are getting bludgeoned to death? I think not.Now, let's get to the plot: IT STUNK! I'm not going to give anything away, but it's mind boggling that someone in Hollywood green-lighted this script. I know it's a remake, but seriously, I think a monkey could've done better. I haven't seen the original, but I've heard it wasn't that good - so why remake it?? Money, money, money.I'll tell ya what's truly perplexing to me is the current rating on IMDb - 6.4!!!

A Remake With Bite,"This remake of Wes Craven's cult classic from the 70's features a family who get stranded in the desert and have to square off with a family of inbred cannibals.The Hills Have Eyes wisely settles its audience into the mayhem for the first 40 minutes or so. We get fleeting glimpses of upcoming danger until one particular scene where everything falls apart at once and we see the main bad guys in full light during one incredibly violent and intense sequence where they siege upon the family. From then on, the film never lets up and you might find it hard to catch your breath. It felt me drained.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
My way of reviewing a horror film,"This is not a very in-depth review for the movie itself. It's more of a generic ""this is how I grade a horror movie"", but i think people will find it useful: When I go to a movie (horror especially) I want to know next to nothing about it and see where it takes me. I've had too many experiences hearing about a movie and going into it with a certain expectation and having it shattered. so, ignorant of as much possible, I want a horror movie to:--Scare me-- OK, duh, but i mean: not just cheap ""BOO!!"" scares but shocking me with twisted, messed up, depraved actions that I'm glad I could never think up myself. I'm not especially squeamish, so i expect a good horror movie to lay the depravity on thick and make me think, ""oh sh**!""--Be believable-- I hate it when an actor makes a stupid decision or a plot line that would never happen brings you into reality and you think, ""oh yeah, i'm watching a movie. the writer who came up with that idea right there is an idiot.""--Draw me in-- Have believable characters, character growth (if even possible in a horror movie), contain sufficient suspense and gore, able to create reactions from me - make my jaw drop, have me (want to) yell at the screen, feel my heart rate increase, etc.This movie does it all. I don't care about how it relates to the original or whether or not it's offensive. All i know is i was scared, i got involved with the movie / characters, and enjoyed it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A perfect example wher the remake is far superior to the original.,"Saw this on a DVD in 2006. Had seen the original on a VHS in the late 80s. Bought the dvds of the remakes. Felt like reviewing the remake as its much better than the original. Alexander Aja (High Tension) did a terrifc job in remaking Wes Cravens 1977 cult movie. Aja managed to greatly improve upon the flawed original in more ways than can be counted. This one is scarier, intense, a visceral experience n more technically improved remake coz of the larger budget and major studio backing. This movie is like a shotgun to your senses. The mood, atmosphere, and music add the perfect touch of edge of your seat creepiness. This is an extremely rare occurrence when a remake is far superior to the original. Cinematographer Maxime Alexandre allows Aja to use the desert to its fullest to create a foreboding landscape. The hills and desert in bright yellows and subdued reds. The Moroccan locations that double for New Mexico r captured perfectly as a waste land totally isolated and foreboding at the same time.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Awful until the last 10 minutes,"Let's get something straight from the off, this is not a horror movie where the scares come from the unknown, the film is based on gore and killings. The fact the film got as high as a 3 was down to the last 10 minutes, otherwise it would be languishing on 1.It's not in the slightest bit scary as their is no tension, and twists as someone mentioned in the featured comment...where?! The director includes too many of the deformed characters too really feel scared by any one of them and he goes with the old mistake of making them almost invincible.I haven't seen the first, but if this movie sticks closely to the storyline I'm unsure of why anyone would want to do a remake of it. It's one saving grace is that it creates a few protagonists that react in the same human way as anyone else would, making it easier for them to be related too or enjoyed.Overall, only a good movie if you like gore, in terms of suspense, thrills, twists and a decent antagonist/s (which all combine to make good horror films) this film comes up WAY short.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"My favorite horror remake that is better than Wes Craven's original its, more bloody and disgusting","I love The Hill Have Eyes to death my all time horror favorite film, which is much better than Wes Craven's original movie. Alexandre Aja's vision is more bloody more disgusting and Aaron Stanford as Doug is ulitamate hero and a bad-ass. He has more to do than the guy who played Doug in the original movie.
Emilie de Ravin is hot and gorgeous as always. You have gory deaths, bloody terrific scenes. I love how Bobby and Brenda lure Papa Jupiter (Billy Drago) towards the trailer and prepare an explosive trap, which destroys the trailer.Alexandre Aja is a bad-ass director he directed the film better than Wes Craven did. I have the unrated version on Blu-ray I love, love this film to death. I don't like the sequel that come out in 2007. I don't like Wes Craven's sequel. I like the original ""The Hills Have Eyes"" movie that Wes Craven directed in the 70's, heard that the movie was based on true story but it was added fiction. I love this film with House of Wax, Friday the 13th, The Thing, The Blob and A Nightmare on Elm Street is my all time favorite horror film of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Absolutely Horrible,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I watched it last night with my brother and after the movie ended I wish had those 2 hours of my life back. I have not seen the original so I can not comment on that. This movie ranks up there with Battlefield Earth. The film was very unrealistic the characters actions were just plain unbelievable. For example, the victims have a limited amount of ammo yet feel the need to just fire into the darkness or at some random creature hundreds of yards away. Also how have the mutation people been able to survive on their own for 50 plus years with the occasional passer by. This film is littered with plot holes and just plain bad. Basiclly stay away from this film and don't waste 2 hours of your life.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Far better than 1977,"I can just far out say that this was 100% better than 1977. The 1977 version was so cheesy. I know it's one of Craven's first movies,but I think we can agree that his best films are Nightmare on elm street and Scream. 2006 version offers more action,more emotion,better blood effects,and action packed fighting. While 1977 only show only little of it. Personally I thought 1977 looked like a bunch of cave men more than mutants. The 2006 version had better unexpected scares and mysteries to why it is the family was stuck in the dessert. While 1977 actually just gives the whole movie away by showing the trailer. I don't know why,but it's just my opinion that the 2006 version showed more empathy in horror. Like 1977 just tells the story about these people around the beginning of the movie,while,of course,2006 gets to the story last before the action fighting begins. Just to get to the point,and I have already said this before,but 2006 was just better.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Copletely stupid - completely funny,"One of the funnies horror movies I have seen yet. Amazingly stupid and basically just a splatter flick, the reactions of the people and their acts where so predictable and wrong that I just had to laugh all the time. It had few new ideas, but a lot of blood, blood and - oh yeah - body parts. Probably the logic of the story was burnt away with the atomic explosion, but who cares - if you liked ""Army of Darkness"" (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106308/) you'll probably like this one. Just don't take it seriously! I still give it a 3 rating, since I got the impression the movies was meant to be serious and not meant to be funny.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of my favorite horror remakes,"I was really glad I decided to watch this again because I really enjoyed it.The movie had plenty of jump scares and bits that made you really think and not being able to take your eyes off the screen.There was still the bits where you could tell that something that was going to happen and it was predictable but the jump scares and differences from the original made it a great horror remake.When Bob was being burnt on the tree that was a bit that i was completely not thinking was going to happen but if it didn't you would really think where the guy went after he got captured by the mutants.Also the first time the two mutants got into the van and one of the mutants raped Brenda I thought this was sort of clich√© in horror movies but in this case all they wanted to do is re-produce.Throughout the rest of the film I was enjoying it, plenty of jump scares and scenes that really made you think.I really wish the ending was a little better but of course at the end of the film as it was zoning out from Doug, Bobby and Brenda you could see a unknown mutant looking at the three survivors. I have yet to watch the second one (2007) so maybe this means that the mutant at the end is one from the sequel in 2007.Altogether great film I enjoyed it from beginning to end so I rate it a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
At least it improves..,"Having not seen the original, I cannot compare the two.. but I am pretty sure I have seen a hundred other films just like this. A family are on the road with their caravan through the desert on the way to California, and unwisely decide to listen to a weird petrol store attendant's advice on taking a short cut. En Route, the tyres mysteriously blow out on their car, and strand them in the middle of nowhere with little water and (conveniently) no phone signal. Little do they know, this area used to be a ground for nuclear testing.. and the mutated survivors of these atrocities aren't happy about having strangers on their patch..After a VERY slow start with a lot of bad dialogue delivered by third rate actors, the film finally gets going around the half-hour mark. Then, in a devastating sequence of events that is never topped, we get an attack on our protagonists which is so gratuitous it should satisfy even the most demanding gorehound. Sadly, after this high it soon degenerates back into a standard mediocre horror flick. We get the typical scenario of the mild mannered man who has finally had enough and proceeds to take revenge on those who have kidnapped his baby. There's a lot of blood & guts to come, but it is directed in such an unexciting fashion your pulse level won't rise above normal very often.It doesn't help when there are many strange decisions taken by the characters that put them in more danger, you quickly lose sympathy for them. Why, for example, would you leave an infant and it's mother alone if you knew there were killers in the area? And why shoot a pursuer at point blank range when you can blow him up with your motorhome (which has all your supplies in it)? Also, how many times do you need to be reminded to tie your dogs up if they keep running away every five minutes? Yep, these are all very worthy questions, but not ones you'll find any sensible answers to here.Overall though, despite my complaints above, I have to take my hat and say it was better than I thought it was going to be. At least after the snoozeworthy first third, the film is never really boring. It contains enough action to make it a hit with teen audiences, and you cannot possibly predict who will live or die as is common with most in this genre. The ending drops a strong hint there could be a sequel. Wow, I'm surprised. Is that the sound of a new franchise I hear? Hollywood must be very pleased.. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nicely done remake,"THE HILLS HAVE EYES (2006)directed by: Alexandre Ajastarring: Aaron Stanford, Vinessa Shaw, Emilie de Ravin, and Dan Byrdplot: A suburban American family have their car and trailer break down in the middle of a nuclear bomb test village in the desert, which is occupied by mutated, murderous, possibly cannibal rapists, and you know the drill.my thoughts: I was just as excited to see the remake at the Palace Theatre as I was to see the original. I knew that it's directed by Alexandre Aja and produced by Wes Craven, where can you go wrong with that?After the opening murder, this film didn't impress me too much. It did have a very good atmosphere, as in the original. But I didn't like how almost everything was exactly the way it was in the original since I was watching them back-to-back.But then, once the violence began, I realized this is a fun, gory remake.The deaths are almost the same but shown with more blood and guts, we have Doug (this time played by Aaron Stanford) taking the lead while in the original he wasn't too developed.The suspense was also great here. You never know how many things can happen to an infant. And half this movie has Doug trying to keep his baby from biting the dust.Emilie de Ravin and Dan Byrd take the characters of Brenda and Bobby to a different level, having Ravin show more of a naughty side and Byrd show more of a bad ass side.The only thing that really bothered me from that point on was the ending, it just didn't do it for me.

The backstory of the villians and their town that was not included in the first film doesn't really land well in 2024.

had good points,"Actually, I usually don't like gory slasher films except a few classier ones like Halloween (because of Michael Pleasance as the doctor) and night of the living dead, etc. I only saw this because there was nothing else to watch except garbage about gay cowboys, racial films, and transvestite films).It seems impossible to say if this film is left or right. Yes it mentions government nuclear tests but it also mentions democrats not liking guns and brings to mind the major gay rights supporting, terrorist supporting (like the new film Vendetta) and agenda of democrat controlled Hollywood. But this film also leans left in some ways. basically, the film has hardly any agenda which is great. This was a big cut above most slasher films with a low budget look. It removes eroticism from horror in a redefining way. There is a clear good and evil here. The victims are not shown as fools or deserving it.

"Creepy and bloody... Yeah, great!","""The Hills Have Eyes"" is the remake of Wes Craven's 1977 horror classic. I haven't seen that one,but I've seen this, and I loved it.

I'm not squeamish or adverse to violence in films, but the utter depth of brutality in this film was inhuman - was very nearly physically sick when I left. ***POSIBLE SPOILER***And it doesn't stop at merely murdering the protagonists, but degrading them in every way imaginable, not only dehumanizing the mutants, but the victims as well.

Spectacular horror experience,"I am always wary of remakes of classic horror films, but this version of the Hills Have Eyes did not disappoint. First of all, the soundtrack was fantastic. The sounds really gave the feel of reality being eaten away by radiation while the orchestral parts gave a powerful emotional underscore to the scenes. Although the movie starts off slow, the action picks up at a pace that is neither too slow, nor too jarring. Even as someone who has seen a lot of horror movies, I was made rather uncomfortable by some of the nasty situations, but I still found myself cheering for the hero as he battled the evil mutants. This is probably because I am a registered Democract and also happen to sell cell phones for a living, and thus can relate to him rather well. The political aspects of the film are in the same commentary realm as that of George Romero. I don't often find myself on the edge of my seat much anymore in the theaters, but The Hills Have Eyes really gave me my money's worth.

"""Wrong Turn"" gone Wrong","As the film is ""spoiled"", so is my review full of Spoilers.I must admit up front that I gave up after an hour. Of course, I was hoping the family would be massacred before my boredom threshold was reached, but no such luck.There is nothing subtle about this film regarding character development, plotting or ""creation"" of suspense, of which there is absolutely no suspense whatsoever. We are deluged almost from the start with interactions between family members and all too soon get to meet, in daylight, the evil radiation diseased coal-mining monsters.First of all, I don't really give a hoot about this boring family, but the director apparently coerced the screen writers to pad this film to the hilt giving us all the clich√©d characters under the sun. The family is a caricature of the generation gap and political polarization which has existed since before the Constitution was written up.Let's see, the dad's a private eye who haphazardly fires his gun at oxygen molecules and then gets into a vehicle during a duress causing scenario, in the dark of night, without looking in the back seat first. Brilliant screen writing, but I was bored to tears way before this scene.Oh yes, let's not forget that mister private eye, whose job it is to find people, has led his family into a completely deserted desert which was used by the government for atomic weapons testing.The son, influenced by his father's gun-toting antics, is portrayed as freaked out after finding one of his dogs guts ripped open and yet wanders off the main ""camp site"" alone, at night, without his gun.The mentally deranged gas-station attendant has, gasp, almost no teeth and looks not at all affected by radiation poisoning like the others of his ilk do. Mr. gas-pump spends about 10 really dull minutes with the family pumping their vehicle with gasoline, and telling them exactly how to proceed to their destination. After an impromptu scene where he suspects they might find out he's a deranged gas-pump attendant with cannibalistic tendencies, he then proceeds to guide the family in the direct opposite direction. And Mr. private eye listens!By the way, who delivers the gasoline to the gas-station in the middle of an area abandoned by and forbidden by the U.S. government? Who delivers the food and drinks to this diner in no man's land?The nuclear coal-mining victims are portrayed as wild, mindless cannibals, yet know how to fire weapons, gut out dogs and outwit stupid families who listen to the gas-stop attendant who thankfully finally shoots his brains out almost half-way through the film.The son-in-law is a peace loving democrat who sells cell phones and won't pick up a gun, but will venture out, at night, without a gun, to search for mr. private eye with mr. private eye's son.Apparently, my suspension of disbelief failed me.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Hills Have Eyes An Effective Horror Remake,"The Hills Have Eyes is an effective horror remake that was better than expected. This film is definitely not for the squeamish but if you're a horror movie fan than you'll probably enjoy this one. Director Alexander Aja has done a decent enough job giving audiences a gruesome horror film with the perfect location that builds up suspense as the movie goes and things continue to get even more dangerous for the characters who find themselves in a desperate fight for survival. The cast are admirable in their roles including Aaron Standford, Kathleen McQuinlan, Vinessa Shaw, Emile de Ravin, Dany Byrd, and Ted Levine. Some of the actors aren't in it that much (except Standford, de Ravin, and Byrd who get the most screen time) but they do make the best of their limited screen time. The same can go for the relatively unknown actors playing the mutant cannibals. All of them are believable and they play their truly frightening characters to perfection. The make up used to create their characters are incredible because they look realistic as far as horror movies go not to mention many of them are absolutely terrifying and scary. This film may not have had me wetting my pants but The Hills Have Eyes has its share of suspense and scary moments that will make you jump in your seat. The brutal deaths committed by both the mutants and the main characters are well executed fitting the tone of the film. The music also adds to the suspense and syncs very well with the feel of the movie. Also worth mentioning is the location they chose because it definitely adds a lot to the film because the desert in which the characters find themselves is totally cut off from civilization. A place forgotten by humanity where a race of mutant cannibals have been lurking in the shadows snatching and dismembering victims who dare come into their territory. The dialogue for the film wasn't the greatest at times and there were a few predictable moments but the rest of the movie made up for it's couple of flaws. Overall The Hills Have Eyes is an above average remake with plenty of inventive gruesome deaths, just the right amount of suspense, and solid acting by the cast thats sure to please almost any fan of the horror genre.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Chilling Horrific Remake,"This is one of those horror remakes that bucks the trend by being a solid effort which is more horrifying than the original. For those who haven't seen the original this tells the story of a family stranded in the desert where miners and their families refused to leave when the govt began nuclear testing. This remake of the Wes Craven Classic doesnt pull any punches and it brings the horror, Violence and gore and is definitely enough to make you squirm in your seat. A must for horror fans.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Desert of Dread,"The Hills Have Eyes is a harrowing and unrelenting remake that surpasses its predecessor in nearly every respect. Directed by Alexandre Aja, the film reimagines Wes Craven's 1977 cult classic with heightened tension, more visceral horror, and a polished yet raw intensity that cements its place as a standout in 2000s horror cinema.The plot retains the essence of the original: a family stranded in the unforgiving Nevada desert falls prey to a group of horrifying, mutated cannibals. What sets this version apart is the depth of its execution. Aja masterfully builds a palpable atmosphere of dread from the moment the family enters the desolate terrain, crafting a slow-burn terror that explodes into sheer chaos.The cast delivers powerful performances, grounding the film in human vulnerability. Aaron Stanford shines as Doug, whose transformation from unassuming son-in-law to desperate, vengeful survivor anchors the story. Emile de Ravin, as Brenda, adds emotional weight with her portrayal of strength under unimaginable pressure. The family dynamic feels authentic, making their plight all the more gut-wrenching as the mutants pick them off one by one.The film's antagonists, led by the grotesque and menacing Papa Jupiter, are genuinely terrifying. Aja delves deeper into the mutants' backstory, connecting their existence to nuclear testing, which adds a layer of unsettling realism. The brutality of their actions is matched by the intensity of the violence, which, while graphic, never feels gratuitous. Each shocking moment serves to heighten the stakes and immerse the audience in the family's desperate fight for survival.Visually, the film is stunning in its horror. The barren, sun-scorched landscape becomes a character in itself, amplifying the isolation and hopelessness of the setting. Aja's direction ensures that every frame brims with tension, whether through lingering, dread-filled shots or explosive bursts of action. The sound design and score further enhance the experience, making even the quiet moments unnerving.The Hills Have Eyes doesn't shy away from its grim, unrelenting tone, which may be overwhelming for some viewers. However, for fans of intense, extreme horror, this remake delivers on every front. It manages to balance its raw brutality with a strong narrative and character depth, making it far more than a simple exercise in shock.This is a rare remake that honours the spirit of the original while surpassing it in both technical execution and emotional impact. It stands as a chilling, unforgettable experience that pushes the boundaries of modern horror.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Awful,"God I hated this movie. It was so awfully written. I just can't imagine this scenario playing out like this. The writer made this movie out to be as if nobody in this family has common sense. All throughout the film I was screaming at the family characters... commenting how dumb each and everyone of them are. I never wanted the bad guys to win so much... i wanted them to just end all of them and get this horrible movie over with. And If I can remember, the original was just as bad. FFS, give these characters a little more intelligence. Who takes a family pulling 5 to 10 ton trailer on a unmarked dirt road and expect nothing would happen...",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Intense and kind-of disturbing,"So I didn't really know what to expect with this one. I've seen the original, and that one was bad enough. But with today's technology and Alexandre Aja directing (I've seen ""High Tension""), I knew that this one would be rough.I wasn't let down, either. From the get-go, this movie is intense. The death scenes are so awesome. I can't wait to see this unrated. The trailer scene was the worst. It really creeped me out. And when Doug went after the baby, I felt like he was diving into Hell by going into the Hill people's town. And the chase scene in the house between him and one of them (I don't remember which) was awesome. This movie may or may not disappoint you because it is a lot like the original, which, I guess, is a good thing. It shows how dark the human nature can be. Fans of gore and violence won't be let down. Some of the camera techniques were a little odd, but other than that, the directing was wonderful. The acting was right for the film. Nothing really stood out in my mind.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hope For Horror,"After SNEAKING into the theatre as I was underage, I watched this movie with little to know hopes of it being any good. After losing all faith in the horror movie genre after seeing poor movies such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, House of Wax, The Grudge etc. This was a refreshing change. I don't know if it's because I thought I would hate it or the fact that it was SO suspenseful but I loved every second of this film. (I'm not sick I just love suspense.) The film kicks off with a nice little kill scene to get you prepared for the rest of the necessary gore. As we are first introduced to the characters there are mixed emotions but it turns into a character based film where you feel concern and remorse for the characters. This is also due to the fine and little known cast. I didn't find the movie predictable or one bit frustrating. Although the cinema I was in, there were a few laughs after one of the very graphic killings. You will be left asking yourself 'Can they do that'. Oh yes they can. Usually in horror movies you will turn to the person beside you and say 'This is where the character gets it' but this film leaves you wrong and feeling a bit stupid. So don't predict in this film just in case.I saw the remake before the original which is definitely best to do. I've read other comments and in my opinion I don't understand how such an average movie like the original was turned into such a 'masterpiece'. Keep in mind this is just opinion. I loved everything about this movie, especially the fact that you WILL be on the edge of your seat for most of it. Without talking the movie up please watch it and just sit back and enjoy horror at its finest. I have got the date of its DVD release implanted in my brain and so should you.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Senseless Violence...,"This movie was absolutely atrocious. Perhaps the most tasteless movie I have ever seen. I have not once in my life walked out of a movie before it was over. This is the exception. After seeing rape and senseless violence I had had enough. This movie is just disgusting. Makes Hostel look like the Little Mermaid. I would recommend this to no one except maybe the mentally impaired. This was just disgusting. There were about 20 people who left along with me which I had also never seen. I had never seen anyone walk out of a movie early, and this one had twenty including myself which is saying something. Senseless and brutal violence...not your average horror movie at all. Just atrocious I cannot say enough how disgusting this film was.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Well-made modern exploitation trash.,"Having never seen ""The Hills Have Eyes"" (1977), I can't say whether this is a good remake - what I can say is that this is a solid exploitation film. Importantly, our protagonists are fairly likeable and only irritating in the ways that normal people are. Their chemistry with one another is good, and the actors convey their characters' distress later in the film very well.The story is well-paced, dedicating a good chunk of its running time simply to introducing the protagonists and their family dynamic, as well as building up the tension with hints of something wrong. Halfway through the film descends into chaos, and the attack is an awesome sequence that flips everything on its head and turns this into something of a revenge flick. This film is trashy and definitely not high art, but it's fully aware of that fact and embraces the exploitative nature of the original film's subject matter.There's a sort of grainy, grindhouse look to the orange-y desert landscapes that really suits the atmosphere. Good use is also made of the environment, including the desert and hills, a huge bomb crater full of old cars, and the bomb-testing village littered with scorched mannequins. There's also some good makeup and prosthetic work on display, most notably the hill-person known as 'Big Brain', and good sound design around the violence (gunshots, rattling chains). Even the throbbing, bass-y score is good, and mixed in nicely with some old-timey ""Fallout""-esque music.The nuclear themes are outdated and portrayed in an over-the-top way, but they're still kinda creepy for what they are. There's some neat symbolism to the protagonists' use of guns too, as the nuclear American family brings weapons into the wilderness. Not a particularly deep movie overall, but a thoroughly enjoyable and distressing exploitation piece.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Happy to see Sloth still getting booked <3,"I thought this was going to be a lot more gratuitous/gore porn than it was. Don't get me wrong, it was extremely violent and gory... but I appreciated that there was still an interesting story there and the plot wasn't just a vehicle for vats of blood and guts.This was scary and tension filled without relying solely on jump scares which I always appreciate. The acting was solid across the board. At first I was annoyed by the cheesy score but it ended up feeling much more stylized and purposeful leading me to actually liking it.I just thought it was a really solid, entertaining experience all around.

The Hills Have Eyes : Biggest Waste of Time/ $4.50,"The plot, in theory, is good. Communism works...in theory. You see where I'm going here. The first 5 minutes of this movie is as good as it will get. Between the people running around in 110 degree weather in 2 shirts ( 1 long sleeved) and jeans, THEN putting on a heavy jacket to walk while still being concerned about water intake still baffles and enraged me. Blood trails from a body that had been dead for at least 24 hours also makes no sense.....blood coagulates and does not flow after the heart stops beating. This movie just further reinforced the notion that all recent horror movies ( other than the Saw series) do belong in the horror genre, but instead of the usual reasons, it is scary because people actually think it is good. I cannot emphasize my hate for this movie and the regret i have for being one of its victims.p.s. don't bitch about my grammar, this movie isn't worth the time. The 22% of voters that gave this movie a 10/10 must have been severely intoxicated, mentally challenged, or most likely both.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
I must put my two cents in on this one,"Right off the bat, I can tell you this movie will have very mixed reviews. I saw it on opening night with about 70 annoying teenagers, a few small children, and a couple real moviegoers like myself. After viewing the film, I jumped on IMDb to check the early reviews. I would like to address first my position on why the people that gave negative reviews are wrong. You don't go see a film such as The Hills Have Eyes for kid's night out and some good family entertainment. I read reviews that talk about this movie is atrocious and an over the top gore fest and things of that nature. The truth is, this movie is very violent with some gut wrenching scenes and some truly sadistic actions, but it is justified....let me finish. One review stated you would have to be a cold cold person to enjoy a film like this one, and I strongly disagree. This movie has a lot of emotion and very good acting. Very rarely in horror cinema do you get a chance to see what a murder actually does to a family. They really capture the suspense and drama of the situation and it's very real impacts on the family members. There is a lot of very well thought out heart behind the plot of this movie. Second, I read in a review that the gore takes the place of suspense, which is totally incorrect. The large amounts of unflinching gore and violence were put in places that were not supposed to be suspenseful to begin with. The gore comes from the protagonists actually rising up against incredible odds for the sake of love and family. The scene where the main character rises to his feet after being totally drained of all fight from opening his eyes to his wedding ring is absolutely genuine and fantastic. The suspense is there before the protagonists begin their uphill battle when they are the ones being preyed upon. OK now I've addressed a couple issues that concerned me. Now let me give you the good and the bad rundown on The Hills Have Eyes remake. The good points outweigh the bad by a long stretch. #1 - The acting is way above par from what I expected. The guy who plays Bobby is an especially solid and intense actor. #2 - The directing doesn't fall victim to clich√©d ways to present a truly eerie feel. Aja gets mad props here. #3 - The antagonists in the movie are crazed and very monster-like, which makes the viewer have absolutely no sympathy for the murderers. To often we see movie makers somehow glorify the cold killers and the agony they place upon people. Not here my fellow moviegoers, here you will feel nothing but hatred towards these savages. Even if they are deformed and mentally unbalanced due to government nuclear testing, they still deserve to die. #4 - -------SPOILER--------- The protagonists actually fight back instead of just getting stalked and murdered like so many other movies. It is great when a movie shows the unbelievable fight a family member can have for another. They fight with every last energy they have and never give up or give in. The family fighting back is really where the gore hits in and it every bit appreciated by the time it happens. People were actually clapping in the movie theater when they fought with heart to overcome the eyes in the hills. -------END OF SPOILER------ #5 - I had to say it guys, the gore. The violence is well placed and satisfying to even ""Hostel"" lovers. This stuff is truly unforgiving in it's presentation I kid you not. THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART. #6 - The setting was outstanding. They really show us the isolation and misery of the desert. With edgy camera work and a dark, gritty feel to it, the setting breathes and has a life all on it's own. The setting is the best element of the picture. OK, now for the couple bad elements to the film. #1 - Some parts with the antagonists were a bit cheesy and over acted. They tried to be creepy in a couple parts where it really wasn't needed since the setting and makeup alone was creepy enough. #2 - The protagonists make a couple dumb moves, but then again you must realize that you know the characters are going to go through hell, where as the characters have no idea. #3 - The very last second of the movie was not needed. #4 - The opening scene didn't much impress me and they should have either made it more impacting or just cut it completely. Overall though, this movie is BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL and gets my 7/10 rating. I hope more people will agree with my points of view on this one and really give it a shot. Any horror fan will not be disappointed. Thanks for the time.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A full-blooded horror ride, Aja does it again!","Remake of Wes Craven's 1977 horror classic proves to be a top-notch shocker that's fast-paced and never lets up on its sharp edginess!Family traveling to California breaks down in the New Mexico desert where a band of savage mutants threatens to kill them all.The Hills Have Eyes 2006 is an excellent and fairly faithful remake that works because it manages to retain the same merciless terror that made the original unforgettable. Director Alexandre Aja (who gave us the ultra-creepy High Tension last year) lends some slick style to the movie, but more importantly knows how to drive suspense and gruesome shocks to effectively horrific extremes! As violent and harrowing as the original film was, this remake is even more so. At times the movie is far more nightmarish than the Wes Craven film. The boys at KNB FX provide some truly gory blood-letting and some terrifying makeup work on the villains. There's also great filming locations, excellent set work, and a moody music score to boot.The cast is a strong highlight of the film. Aaron Stanford rises to his role well as a desperate father. Dan Byrd is great as a young victim. Vinessa Shaw does an emotional turn as an ill-fated young woman. Kathleen Quinlan and Ted Lavine are both strong as the parents of the family. Emilie de Ravin is also quite effective as a traumatized young woman.An outstanding remake period, it's easily one of the best in this old-school horror remake cycle!

"""You've Made Us What We've Become!"" (Movie Quote)","Was this 2006 remake, in reality, supposed to be some sort of a ""God-Works-In-Mysterious-Ways"" movie for New-Age, religious zealots?The reason why I ask this question was because whoever wrote the script made a firm point (before all hell broke lose in the story) of letting the viewer know full-well that the entire Carter family (the victims) were, in fact, Christians who actually prayed together as a religious unit.And, if this really was such a movie as I stated above, then it was yet another truly pathetic statement about Christianity as a whole, where (even after their prayers) ""god"" actually allowed his faithful followers (the Carters) to endure all of this horrific violence, bloodshed and murder.I mean, was this hideous ordeal (in a screwed-up sort of way) supposed to somehow renew the faith of the Carters (at least the ones who remained alive) just because the baby was spared?Anyway - This ""Wrong Turn/Texas Chainsaw"" copycat, horror flick was, as I expected, even worse than the 1977 original (which is hard to believe that anything could be worse than the likes of what Wes Craven directed).",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

"At last, a great horror movie!","I've been a great horror fan since I was a little child, and am quite unable to miss a single horror flick even when I know it's bad, like the 99% of all horror movies we're all used to watch these days. And I'm always disappointed by all of them, they're all superficial, shallow, not scary at all, badly acted and horribly written. The result is that if I happen to come across two good horror movies per year (over about 40) I'm happy and satisfied. I've never liked American horror movies based on family slaughter and massacre, which normally take place in deserts or rotten villages lost in the middle of nowhere. Not because I don't like the landscape, but because they're normally just BAD. Well, I have to say that ""The Hills have Eyes"" is the best horror movie I've seen this year (so far). The movie is well acted and directed, the soundtrack is great and the script is also fantastic. But what strikes me most is that I can't stop thinking about it, it leaves you with a disturbing feeling of fear and danger that is very unlikely to be found in any other horror flick nowadays.

I thought it was stupid, unpleasant with lousy special effects and acting. Well this one is STILL stupid but more unpleasant, the gore has been upped to an incredible degree (this was edited to get an R rating) and the acting is much better. But--that makes it harder to watch. The acting is so good that I was horrified (and not in a good way) by what I was seeing. Seeing a normal American family attacked and tortured and killed AND acting like it's really happening can get to you. It didn't scare me--it just disgusted me.Also, surprisingly, this was pretty boring. The graphic gore is in small, but powerful, doses. It's surrounding by boring dialogue and one endless sequence when one man wanders all over a deserted town. It's not creepy or chilling--just dull. It was so dull that when the violence kicked back in I was so bored it had no effect. Also a good portion of the audience walked out--in boredom.So if u liked the first one you MIGHT like this one.

Better Than The Original - Sorry Wes...,"There's not much difference between this remake and the 1977 original. A family of campers have decided to drive across America. Unfortunately for them, this includes the desert, wherein the 1950's the army carried out a series of nuclear tests. After stopping for gas, and inadvertently offending the station attendant, he tells the group of a shortcut through a valley in the hills... Just as it starts to dawn on them that the shortcut is turning out to be a long drive, their tyres blow out... This is a 50th wedding anniversary they'll remember until they die... which won't be long...This may sound disrespectful of Wes Craven, but the best thing about this film, by far, is the direction. Alexandre Aja, who had only previously directed the acclaimed, magnificent, and one of my favourite films, Haute Tension, does the story proud. His eye for panoramic shots and the ability to create an atmosphere of aloneness with them, and then his use of the nuclear-blasted ""Little America"", complete with creepy mannequins, creates a really uneasy eeriness that's exactly what the story needed.Also opting to get rid of the dreadful electronic soundtrack was a bonus. This was a major hindrance to the original. Without it, the excitement is created in different ways; camera shots, angles, lighting, acting, and sound effects.The other nice thing was the cast... though a cameo by Michael Berryman wouldn't have gone amiss. There are a more than a few solid actors in the film. Ted Levine as Big Bob the ex-policeman and father of the group. He gives a solid reliable performance in a supporting role, though he's yet to come across a role as meaty as his Buffalo Bill Silence Of The Lambs character. His wife, Ethel, is played by the beautiful and talented Kathleen Quinlan. Though the stand out characters is Tom Bower as the gas station attendant, Robert Joy as Lizard - he really does appear to enjoy this role, Dan Byrd as Bobby, and Emilie De Ravin as Brenda.Also, the special effects have moved on a long way from 1977... instead of the bright red blood which flowed copiously back then, we have a more realistic crimson, which gets slashed, gouged, and blasted insanely all over the place. Not only do the hills have eyes, they also run red...This is how a remake should be made. It was brave of Aja not to change the story but to bring it up-to-date, not just in the story but also with the filming techniques. Aja, just adds his skill into the mix and the outcome is beautiful, brilliant, and spooky as hell enjoyment. Because of this, I would recommend every horror fan or wannabe to check this out rather than the original 1977 film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

I also thought it was unrealistic for the family to go on that road with nothing in sight with a new born baby. I couldn't believe that the zombies didn't just kill people off instantly either. I have always been a fan of Wes Craven flicks, but I don't think this movie did him justice.

"If you like horror movies, don't be scared to watch The Hills Have Eyes...","I loved this movie. I have seen lots of horror movies, this was one of the best, if not the best. It is only rated in the 6.4-6.8 star range on this site, considering that it varies with votes, but to me this movie should have around 8-8.5 stars on this site. I give it 10 star rating for a horror movie, and a 9.5 star rating as just a movie. The reason I think it has been rated lower than I expected is because of a few things: gore, blood, and rape. Okay, those aren't reasons to rate a movie badly. This movie is rated R! The R rating allows those things. Its a horror movie, and lets be real, what horror movie doesn't have blood? Okay the rape scene isn't 'ethical' but it sure does add to the horror of this movie. So those things make the movie more of a horror to me, and are not reasons that I wouldn't like this movie. I have seen the SAW movies 1-3 and this movie is quite a bit better. A lot more creepy, has a better story line, better jumps, better acting, better emotions. To the point; this movie is better than all of those movies, head and shoulders.I rented this movie expecting an average thriller and horror movie. It was way better than I expected it to be. It has a 'this could happen in real life' sense to it. Sure, mutant cannibals are very uncommon to say the least, but the pictures at the beginning of this movie so everyone watching it that the nuclear testings DID deform things. Therefore, its possible that mutants could have formed somehow. Its not logical but its possible. The acting was great in this movie overall. Not a lot of big names but still the acting is way better than average. You will most likely be scared and grossed out at various points in this movie, which is how a horror movie is supposed to be. I'll admit I needed about 30 minutes before I could stop thinking about this movie and finally fall asleep. This movie is good, even great. Don't let a little extra gore or one attempted rape scene ruin this movie for you.Final comments. One of my favorite movies, and I'm not just saying that for this review, this is one of my favorite movies that I have seen. I plan on buying this movie, to add it to my collection of only about 15 movies. You will most likely be thinking of this movie next time you go to a desert. The Hills Have Eyes truly is creepy and yes, gory at times. This movie will make you wonder and make you jump. You will want to kill these mutants yourself at the end of this movie. After all, it is a horror movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Unbelievably bad,"Where to start with this crap. It's trying to be like the original and Texas Chainsaw Massacre mixed into one huge melodramatic hunk of celluloid crapola. The Hills Have Eyes is geared for a teen audience and never lets you forget it. It's laughably bad. The acting is just a smidge above House of 1000 Corpses and the directing is possibly worse (if that's possible). The cinematography (hardee-har-har) is like an MTV music video of the lowest quality and just as irritating (jump cuts and illogical angles and edits). The characters are just stupid (both enemies and heroes) and I was just hoping everyone would drink poison and die together in the first five minutes and end the pain. I've seen more entertaining pre-school plays. I love good horror films but this is just an absolute lowest common denominator money grab. If you liked this film, congratulations on not finishing grade 8 and good luck with that service industry career.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Well..,"This movie had potential, and it lost it quite quickly. This gets boring after a while, and the blatant gore is fun but unnecessary. Wouldn't recommend, and wouldn't watch again.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the better remakes,"Traveling through the New Mexico desert, a family finds the area home to a group of deformed mountain-men hunting in the area and must find a way to escape from the ravenous, blood-thirsty psychos.Overall this was quite the enjoyable effort that works better than the original. Among its great points is the rather hyped up amount of tension and suspense this one generates which makes it a far more enjoyable effort. The early scenes of the group out amongst the endless desert dunes under the blazing sunlight or the quick glimpses of them running around the cliffs while the victims are all completely unaware of their presence rare quite chilling, and even other tactics employed here as the glinting metal in the distance, strange grunting or being seen through the binoculars really let this one be known someone' watching them. All of this desert set-up perfectly allows the intense horror action to have a much bigger impact here as those are among the film's best here with the utterly impactful and dynamic van attack sequence. This is exceptionally fun here with a slew of utterly dark and morbid antics from the attempted rape and baby-theft to killing off the mothers all the while the others are distracted by their blazing companion outside, and all together the chaos, action and brutal activity create a spectacular highlight scene. There's a lot more fun here in the last half following up on the attack with plenty of tense stalking through the hills and tunnels before getting to the abandoned town as the walk-through here is just utterly chilling waiting for something to occur within the set-up of the dolls laid out in the town before the big action scenes through the brutal brawling in the house and the final fight in the hills where the brutality comes into even greater degrees where there's plenty of graphic bloodletting and frantic action that makes for plenty of good times here that really makes this so fun with the frantic pace making for quite the exiting time. Along with the creepy and utterly deformed look of the creatures and the truly brutal kills that are far more graphic and bloody than expected, all of these efforts manages to hold off the film's one real flaw here. The fact that this one spoon-feeds us the back-story of their genetic mutation history a second time here after doing so for the very of beginning of this one tends to really drag the film down in a crucial part of the film and lowers their mystique quite a bit by making them rather bland and nondescript during their time here. Overall, this issue is all that hold this one back.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Rape, animal violence and constant children-in-jeopardy.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
candidate for worst movie ever,"i'll keep this brief. this movie was disgusting, stupid, and completely without redemption in even the slightest regard. the sort of film that kills careers and embarrasses all involved. all the usual devices are present, only with less subtlety than even the crassest horror film. see the director's 'Last House on the Left' for an idea of how bad this one is. key elements: nearly unstoppable villainsunbelievably stupid intended victims""authentic"" period detail including television, which wasn't invented until after the town was hit by the blast, let alone likely to be present in such a poor community.really, really sick and repulsive violenceso much screaming and crying and panicking by the victims, one wishes for their rapid demise.a sick movie, made by and for masochists.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
This Is a Really Good Movie,"It seems to me that many horror movies disappoint. They are filled with bad acting or unbelievable plot lines but this movie does not disappoint. It follows the story of a regular family traveling through the desert on their way to a California vacation. The family is extremely likable and this makes it all the more excruciating when you realize they are the targets of some very bad people. The acting in this film is solid, my favorite performance delivered by the actor playing Bobby, the families teenage son. The rest of the cast is excellent as well. There is a lot of gore so if that's disagreeable to you, then don't watch this film. If you are a horror buff then this one will be very enjoyable!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disturbing but good! Definitely worth watching!,"This is great movie. It's definitely not the scariest movie you will ever see but it is very disturbing and some scenes will make you want to throw up. I'm not going to list the scenes like this but there are a lot! It's a splatter horror, so it's not the sort of film that would keep me awake at night, but it's not a nice film. I would recommend it to watch with friends to freak everyone out, but this film is definitely worth watching!SPOILERS AHEAD!The film starts good and you can hardly predict what happens until they reach the gas station. When the man directs them to the hills you know whats going to happen. In this part of the film, you desperately want to tell the family not to go that way. After a while when the car stops, the disturbing part starts. The mutants faces are terrifying!Really good film, watch it! I would not recommend it for people under 13 or people that hate seeing people get tortured.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Reprehensible and abhorrently manipulative film-making,"O.K. Three showers later and I'm in a state where I can analyze this gruesome, disgusting, piece of trash. If this movie hadn't had some scares and shock moments, I would have rated it even lower. Aside from a brutal first attack and clever decoy tactic using a horrific human barbecue (Does Ted Levine have to moan in every film?) it was predictable and formulaic.This movie was very manipulative and over-done. A great filmmaker could get the point across simply by letting the narrative depict the horror of a helpless baby and a teenage girl being trapped inside a trailer with two savage mutated freaks. Here, we have very average filmmakers so they resort to actually showing the events transpiring within. And what are those events?The two savage mutated freaks dry-hump and terrorize the girl and act threateningly towards the baby. OOOOOOOH! Excuse me while I'm not shocked. Lesson: Don't go through the motions of shocking us without any actual shock.Let's be clear: Shock is distinct from repulsiveness: Putting a child in harm's way and having a mutated freak breast-feed off a lactating woman while aiming a revolver at a baby is lower than most would stoop. Yes it's repulsive, but so is watching someone take a crap on stage or lick up vomit. It's beneath Wes Craven.Besides, everyone in the audience knew you wouldn't actually have the cajones to go through with the worst of it.Few movies actually make me mad. I can usually stay casually detached and objectively observant without seeing through the tactics so clearly. This movie made me mad. It insulted my intelligence. I could see what the director was trying to do a mile away and it was frustrating to watch as the fuse was lit only to have the bomb go off too soon.I liked the allusions to ""Straw Dogs"" with the broken glasses etc. The ""Total-nerd-turned-scrappy-survivor"" was a neat idea and the transformation was well handled.It always strikes me as funny how expert killers turn all thumbs in climactic showdowns. David slays Goliath so often in these glorified B-pictures that the betting line in Vegas always favors the little guy.A great horror movie will have three elements:1. Good shocks and scare moments 2. an overall pervasive sense of dread 3. abstract conceptual terrorThis movie had all three elements but none were executed deftly or properly fleshed out. The shocks did come but were routine (Uhhh, guys? The fast sillouette moving by the camera has been done about a million times before!) The sense of dread was palpable in the first act, with just enough friction in the family to make it seem realistic, but enough family chemistry to make you dread what was going to happen. The abstract conceptual terror was that of human evolution or mutation due to radioactivity, but it was a poor rationale for the events depicted in the film.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"About Time, A Decent Horror Flick...","This has to be one of my favourite horror films of recent times, along with Final Destination 3. What makes this movie stand out is that it goes further than most movies, making the viewer so scared and then firing a violent death at them. Very disturbing and gruesome ones may i add.To begin with, this movie started out like a standard horror/suspense flick. Building up all the tension with some nicely placed scares. Then after all the horror, comes a violent revenge film. Thats probably what made me love this, is that it doesn't stick to death after death of dumb/helpless people - they finally fight back! To be honest, I was expecting more violence and explicit scenes with all the hype. But i guess thats saved for an Uncut DVD :D I recommend this for any Horror lover out there who would finally like to see something that feels original, is actually scary and makes you feel sorry for victims.10 Stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wes Craven's Classic Gets A Makeover,"While Wes Craven is often called a ""master of horror"" (whatever that means), the film here is driven by the intensity of the situation and the speed of the film making. Violence is fast and filled with various camera angles, the tense moments flare up with lots of lockdown shots and slow pans. There is a good deal of work that has gone into matching the character's emotion to the camera work as they survive the mutant results of government nuclear experiments.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Jaw Dropping!,"Before I saw this movie, I had heard of the '77 cult classic. I didn't expect anything special. I saw this rental lying around the house, and popped it in the DVD player, not expecting more than a gory good time. Once the final credits started to role, my jaw was hanging 5 inches down. I was absolutely hypnotized by its brilliance. This 2006 remake has led me to be one of the biggest Hills Have Eyes fans there is. A very unique thing about the Hills Have Eyes is that the gore and brutality are at the perfect times. So, if you're expecting some slasher film with blood in every other scene, this movie is much, much more (even though there is a TON of blood). Above all it's inspiring. It's about what a man will do to save someone close to him, even in the worst possible circumstances. Still with all that, to be an excellent movie, it has to have great acting. Well, you have your wish! The acting is spectacular. Now that brings us to the mutants. The make up effects were genius. The mutants look so real and gruesome, it's almost hard to look at the screen the entire movie, and that's exactly how you know the make up effects are great! All in all, this movie is any horror fans dream, and if you come out not liking the movie, then you're not a true horror fan.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Violence that I no longer wish to see,"I am not a violence wuss. I have never considered a film to violent or over the top. My personal thoughts on this film is that the kind of violence in certain scenes was unnecessary. The mood could have been set without it and all it did was make me sick to my stomach.There seems to be a kind of acceptance of sexual violence in Hollywood at the moment. I think we may be reaching a point where a fair warning should be given. Many many people have been affected by this form of violence. These people should not be subjected sans warning to this form of violence as it may bring back issues they should not have to deal with at their nightly entertainment.I don't have a problem with the movie being shown and it is not a big deal if this stuff doesn't affect other people. I reiterate my point a warning would be sufficient. I no longer want to see this form of violence in a movie and I don't think that 18A is enough of a warning lots of films with swearing and lots of gun-play or maybe just some nudity are rated 18A.It wasn't that this movie was awful (as I said in my rating) but that ruined the mood for me and almost made me physically ill. I am well aware I sound like a wuss who cant handle violence, I can, but never again in this form. I will look harder for warnings of this form of violence in movies, it is not for me.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"It was unbelievably, ridiculously, terrible!","I have seen a number of ""survival horror"" type movies in my horror watching movie career, and i will have to say that this movie was the worst one to date. The main characters were plain stupid (for lack of a better word), they just ran around and screamed and didn't try to ""survive"" until the end of the movie.There was an incredible waste of ammo, and just plain dumb moves on the characters behalf. I would not recommend watching it for anyone, especially those who know even a little bit of how horror/survival horror movies are supposed to flow. I know that every movie has its own feel and what not, but this one was terrible.I will have to applaud the acting abilities of the actors and actresses, they did an amazing job all around.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Sturdy and scenic construction, plenty of shock violence","What makes this film is not so much the violence, which is well choreographed for impact and brutality, with survivors ending up soaked in blood, or the story, which is a sort of expansion of a desert, mutant Deliverance (1972), the mutants themselves being suitably grotesque, but the carefully chosen killing grounds. The locations were a sort of hostile charm offensive, full of stunning rifts, ridges and craters, as well as a spooky ghost town and a dilapidated service stop. This important aspect made the camera work and editing all the more stark and real, so you can more easily feel the rising heat and sense of despair. The Hills Have Eyes is not really like Last House On The Left (2009), being a separate genre more in common with Wrong Turn (2003), The Descent (2005) or Feast (2005). I'd argue that The Hills is better than all three of those movies, though there is plenty of teenage alarm as in Wrong Turn, and the bad guys are similar. The bad guys are less similar in Descent or Feast, which involve basically a separate species after mutation, although the dropping off of characters one by one in highly dramatic incidents is now run-of-the-mill. Still, this is full-on entertainment with great casting and direction, some totally classic scenes and moments, and, for me, some cool originality. Admittedly I haven't seen the original Wes Craven film. The plot wasn't predictable, and the tension was palatable. Great horror that hasn't aged.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
best horror movie EVER made,"this is by far the best horror movie ever made. it started out with psycho,halloween, went to Friday the 13th, then to nightmare on elm street, scream and now to the great hills have eyes. If you do see this, believe me, it's gross, disturbing, and very hard to watch. I have always enjoyed Wes Craven's films, but this beat the sh!t out of the original. Better screenplay, better directing, it's like they just took every idea from the hills have eyes, and made it ten times better. Alexandre Aja does a outstanding job making you closterphobic with most of the film taking place in a camper. It takes place during our time, the cell phones showing us that. Let's just hope that Alexandre remakes more of Wes Cravens films because he sure does a hell of a job at it. I HIGHLY recommend this film to any horror movie goer, of just any movie buff at all. Excellent! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Garbage,"I like horror films, all sorts, liked Scream, The Ring (both Japanese and the American version was OK not great but passable) and am pretty open minded about films. But....this was the worst film ever ..... It had no originality,mutated 'freaks' all in all a bit disturbing because of 'hollywood' scraping the bottom of the barrel for film ideas and the levels the present day horror films have now resorted to. Crude is the best word to describe this film,and pathetically violent (yes you expect this in a horror movie but unoriginal), and the normal terrible make you jump music. There is no empathy with the 'victims' and the hero is terrible. I have to stop now as words cannot describe how terrible this film is. Please I can safely say this is the worst film I have ever seen (Ive seen approx 50 of the top 100 IMDb films and agree they should be where they are.. and I know everyone has different opinions but really the film is dreadful and it does not deserve your well earned money !",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
beyond horrible,"Where do i start? This is one of your typical unoriginal everyone-in-it-is-a-moron gore festivals. The thing that intrigued me most in this movie is that not only are the victims ridiculously stupid but so are the attackers. There are so many clich√©s in this movie and so many logical loopholes that i had a headache when i walked out. And what was worse: I heard people saying not only did they like it, but it was a good movie. Ugh. It kills me when great movies such as the recently Oscar-honored Crash and movies like Brokeback Mountain and The Constant Gardener cant hold water at the box office but crap like this seems to flood our cinemas with a society that obviously has lost the value of entertainment. OK now back to the movie at hand. It is worse than the 1977 original and that is saying a lot because it sucked blue chunks too. Instead of wasting your time on this idiotic remake(I'm beginning to hate that word, find a concrete wall, paint it, sit there until the paint is completely dry and you will have made better use of your time than you would watching this garbage. The Hill may Have Eyes. Too bad they couldn't see how much this movie sucks.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
