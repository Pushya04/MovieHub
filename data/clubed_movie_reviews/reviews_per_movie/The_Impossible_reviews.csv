What a punch in the gut,"I checked this movie out because of the actors, and damn did they deliver. Ewan McGreggor and Naomi Watts are superb, as always, but it's Tom Holland (in his first breakout role) that steals the show. Arguably, he's the central character (although all three of those actors take center stage at various times), and he easily showcases a star on the rise.The film itself is a sucker punch. It hits hard and keeps you hooked either through suspense or heartache. One caveat though: this is by far the most intense and difficult PG-13 film I've ever seen. I'm sure it was rated R until it was toned down for the MPAA, and it probably squeaked by with it's PG-13 rating by only a hair. If you're have difficulty with reality based trauma or are in a headspace that might not tolerate this well, give it some time before you see it--it doesn't hold back what being in a tsunami would feel like. I actually thought it WAS rated R until I checked out the IMDb page.Overall, this is a good watch and a story that should be seen.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Not for the faint of heart,"Despite occurring in Asia, the Boxing day Tsunami of 2004 was truly a world event, with ripples emanating around the world as many of the 280,000 plus victims were holiday makers from all over the world.Focusing on a single family's true story, albeit changing their nationality from Spanish to English, was always going to invite accusations of filtering a tragic story through the eyes of a white privileged family, rather than the locals who lost everything.This is perhaps unfair, in the same way ""Schindlers List"" might be accused of focusing on those few that survived. Highlighting one families initial struggle, by telling a story a modern audience can comprehend or realistically watch, is the only practical option. Artistic licence is regretfully necessary to secure not only movie funding but offer a ray of hope for a western audience to desperately cling to.And holding on, is what you may have to do, even with the glimmer of hope offered. This is truthful, unflinching and harrowing film making.Be warned, this is no easy watch.The story centres on Maria (Naomi Watts ), her husband (Ewan Mcgregor) and three young sons, Lucas (Tom Holland), Simon (Samuel Joslin) and Thomas (Oaklee Pendergast), on holiday at a upmarket beach resort in Khao Lak.The sense of foreboding is swiftly alluded to and when the wave hits, the effect is quite breathtaking. The effects are terrifying to watch but more than that, there is visceral quality to the sound and turmoil. A maelstrom of not knowing which way is up with the sheer terror conveyed in a unsentimental manner, stripped of the usual Hollywood veneer. ""Towering Inferno or ""2012"" this is not, a disaster movie that conveys just that, disaster on a colossal human scale.Managing to survive, Lucas and mum are reunited. The pair attempt to find help for the serious injuries sustained by Maria. The foley and special effect work providing suitably grisly and very believable sound effects and wounds. At times this only stops just short of horror, it is intense, emotional and deeply troubling. The response of Lucas to his mothers injuries and state of undress, is truly gut wrenching.To say too much more would rob the story of it's emotional highs and lows. Overall the film is sensitively handled, with the film makers taking pains to show the local effort and help provided, hammering home that no-one is safe when a Tsunami hits, white, brown, rich or poor. Latterly the film suggests that that being wealthy or just holding good insurance cover, can whisk you away from all the unpleasantness. In the modern world, this represents undisputed fact. Whether this is ""right"", is a philosophical debate not likely to be resolved in a two hour movie.The acting is uniformly good, Watts gets the most to do and excels in a role that cannot have been easy from both a physical and emotional sense. The young boys are all exceptional, on occasion Tom Holland showing world class talent. The director Juan Antonio Bayona, teasing superb performances even from his youngest cast members. McGregor is solid and certainly does not let the side down.Whether the film needed to be made or indeed whether the intended audience exists, is subject to debate. Does it provide a small but just watchable glimpse into what such an event would feel like, yes. Will it live with you for a few days at least, certainly. For those directly involved, is this a fitting tribute to the human spirit and kindness shown, impossible to say.SummaryA natural disaster movie that is both affecting, effective and unflinching in it's depiction of a very real recent event with several notable performances.This is not for everyone, despite the focus on a white middle class family, this is no airbrushed Hollywood watered down TV movie. From the moment the Tsunami arrives, an emotional roller-coaster is unleashed and is not for the faint of heart.http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/",8.0,Anonymous,History
A terrible event ... but a moving film,"THE IMPOSSIBLE (2012)The 2004 tsunami was one of the deadliest natural disasters on record. Because it occurred in the Christmas season and hit many resort area beaches its death toll of almost 250,000 was indiscriminate, taking not only South Asians but many visiting vacationers. People everywhere were affected by it. My own relatives who were then living in Thailand were destined that day to be on the beach, but, unknown to the rest of us, illness caused them to alter their plans. I personally heard from Thai acquaintances the story of nieces and nephews who excitedly ran to the shore to see the wondrous phenomenon of the receding ocean, only to be swamped by its return. Weeks later, flying over the Indonesian coastline, I could see with my own eyes just how far inland the wave had rushed, and the devastation it had wrought.How do you frame such a catastrophe in human terms, and present a situation of pure chaos in a way that makes a compelling story? How do you tell such a tale in a way that respects both the lost and the survivors, many of whom suffered personal tragedies as well, and more of whom bore the guilt of survival? How does one story tell some of the many stories of that day? These were among the challenges that faced director Juan Antonio Bayona and screenwriter Sergio G. Sanchez when they decided to put an account of the 2004 tsunami on the screen. Their solution was to deal with one British family on vacation in Thailand from Japan, but their film uses that family as a catalyst to show the tsunami's awful effect not only on the tourist population but on the local people who suffered even more.Both the film itself and the filmmakers have taken pains to say that this is a ""true story,"" and they have aimed for the greatest possible authenticity in the circumstances. They have based themselves on detailed interviews with the family members and with other survivors, some of whom actually appear in the film. (For example, those who tell their tales to Ewan McGregor at the bus station are almost all actual survivors.) While footage of the tsunami strike itself was shot in a water tank at Alicante on the Spanish coast, and a couple of days filming of interiors took place in Spanish studios, the remainder of this picture was shot on location in Thailand using the real places of the story, such as the Orchid Beach Hotel in Phang Nga, and the actual hospital where much of the action occurs.The actual Thai locations and the many Thai actors keep the production values superb, and give this film an authenticity it would not otherwise have. So of course do the survivors who take part, whose emotions are sometimes all too real. Many video shots exist of the tsunami hitting the Asian beaches, but no one who was not there can have any real idea of what it must have been like to have been caught up by its waters. Bayona has chosen to focus not so much on the massive power of the tidal wave itself but on the sheer terror and disorientation it must have created for those submerged in it, and upon the human toll it took. But his scenes of its striking are horrific enough to give some sense of its magnitude, even on the screen. Nor does he pull his punches in some of the grisly scenes that follow. The impressive results that display both the striking wave and its terrible aftermath owe much to production designer Eugenio Caballero.The big names here are Ewan MacGregor as Henry and Naomi Watts as Maria, his doctor wife, while Geraldine Chaplin has a cameo role as a lady who comforts one of their sons on a starlit night. MacGregor and Watts seem to suit their parts, but in a sense they are playing predictable roles. They become a couple literally torn apart, a father having to search among the debris for the remainder of his family and a mother who for much of the picture hovers close to death. The family's three sons are played by Tom Holland (Lucas), Samuel Joslin (Thomas) and Oaklee Pendergast (Simon). The two younger boys are cute as well as being effective, but that is not really a word that suits Tom Holland. The young British actor displays a surprising maturity and delivers a wonderfully measured performance, reminiscent of a younger Daniel Radcliffe. Despite the bigger names involved, it is his portrayal of Lucas that carries the picture since he is the hub around whom events revolve as the individual stories unfold. That is a lot to ask of a young actor, but Holland delivers.No one story can ever do justice to the events of that day and the days that followed. Nor can a story set in just one location ever capture just how wide-ranging were the tsunami's effects. How can you tell the story of what happened almost simultaneously in Indonesia and India, Myanmar and Malaysia, and eventually affected even the African coast. Thankfully, Bayona doesn't try. He focuses on the few, hoping that through them audiences will better understand the tale of the many. For such a story, The Impossible is perhaps a more than fitting title, but the film works and gives a view that is both visually impressive and dramatically moving.The Impossible premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2012. It will open in Spain on October 11, and go into general release in North America in the last week of December.Ray Lahey",8.0,Anonymous,History
Naomi Watts superior performance,Maria (Naomi Watts) and Henry (Ewan McGregor) are on vacation with their three young kids in Thailand. It's a picture perfect trip at a coastal hotel. Suddenly a tsunami hits and the family is scattered.Naomi Watts gives a harrowing performance. It's a true life story of a family dealing with the 2004 Christmas Indian Ocean tsunami. The action scenes are unbelievable. The scale of it all and the danger it depicts is truly realistic. The performance that Naomi gives is absolutely Oscar worthy. She is truly believable as a mother fighting for her life as she loses track of her family. There are a lot of tear jerking moments here. Some of them pushes a little too far. But it never gets completely fake. Ewan McGregor plays the father who has an incredible scene with a cell phone. Highly recommended.,8.0,Anonymous,History
"Harrowing, emotional portrayal of a devastating event","It would be impossible to try and capture the widespread loss and destruction of this horrible, devastating event. The scope was so large and far too many people lost their lives to even attempt to portray on film. Instead, director Juan Antonio Bayona and screenwriter Sergio G. Sánchez focused smartly on the true story of one family's struggle for survival amongst all that had happened on December 26th, 2004.This allows the film to be much more intimate, and the audience is quickly able to connect with the Bennett family, starting simply with their arrival to Thailand. While the audience was filled with dread in anticipation of what was to come, the Bennetts were blissfully unaware and enjoying themselves over vacation. However, everything soon takes a terrifying turn as the tsunami hits their resort in a horrifyingly realistic manner, sweeping up people as they attempt to flee before it or protect themselves from its awesome power.At this point, I, too, felt like I was drowning. The camera bobs in and out of darkness, in and out of the water, as the family's matriarch, Maria, struggles for breath. Then, clinging hopelessly onto a palm tree, she screams all too realistically for anyone who could possibly help her in a desperate, surprisingly shocking moment. It is at this point where she spots her son, Lucas, floating in the fierce waves, and I held my breath as the struggled for what seemed like an eternity to reunite in the water.In a way, Lucas, brilliantly portrayed by newcomer Tom Holland, carries the film from this point forward. He takes on the role of protecting his stubborn yet badly injured mother, and in the process he's forced to mature far too quickly. During every moment, his emotions and facial expressions convey more than any words ever could, as she shies away from and is frightened by his mother's injuries and nudity, all the while attempting to deal with the scope of the pain and devastation.However, it is his mother, Maria, whom the film truly centers around. Naomi Watts gives quite possibly her finest performances to date, portraying harrowing desperation, stubborn determination in the face of incredible pain and agony, and, ultimately, a sense of love and care despite her deteriorating state. True, she is bedridden for about half the film, but it is during this time where there are these small moments of tenderness and humility which undoubtedly makes Watts's performance one of the best of the year.In fact, the entire cast was exceptional, including Ewan McGregor, the father desperately trying to put together his family again, and the two littlest sons, Thomas, played by Samuel Joslin, and Simon, played by Oaklee Pendergast, both of whose innocence prevented them from thoroughly capturing the extent of this tragic event. The story of these three is intertwined with that of Maria and Lucas, as they all struggle for survive amidst the destruction and reunite amidst the chaos.Ultimately, this is a touching and heartwarming film, as the true kindness of humanity can be seen in this time of great loss. Yes, the tsunami is terrifying, the injuries gruesome and shockingly realistic, and the pain and suffering visible on just about everyone's faces. However, the Bennetts' story is a remarkable one of love, determination, and hope, and it simply cannot be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Tearjerking; The Impossible,"On vacation at an exotic resort in Thailand, a family of 5 are torn apart by a large tsunami that rips the island apart. The mother, played by Naomi Watts and oldest of the three sons do their best to survive while the father, played by Ewan McGregor, juggles between the safety of his two boys and the search for his wife and missing son.Director Juan Antonio Bayona vividly shares the shocking and yet, miraculous story of the Alvarez family. The cinematography when the tsunami sweeps in is nothing short of stunning and captivating. A glimpse of the sheer force and destruction behind this natural disaster will undoubtedly leave you breathless. Watts delivers a strong performance as does McGregor but the stand out here, besides the cinematography, is the brilliant and mature portrayal of the oldest son by young, Tom Holland.An emotional tearjerker, The Impossible is a brilliant film, which will have you glued to the screen as you root against the odds while simultaneously fearing the worst. The fact that it's based on a true story is a testament of the human spirit and the bond of a family.The Impossible is definitely one to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A Must See Movie,"At first I did not think this movie was something I would like to see. I felt it would be one of those movies that once the disaster happened it would become dis-interesting and would be boring the second half of the movie. I am very happy I had the opportunity to see it. The only reason I did not give it a 10 was I thought the character build up was a little shallow. I would have liked to get know the family a little better before the disaster. Other than that I feel that the movie was fantastic. Once the inevitable happened the film kept my interest and was very compelling throughout. The special effects were realistic and not over done. I wish foreign movies like this would make a bigger release in the United States to show Hollywood how to make a movie especially a true story movie. I felt when I was watching this film that I was seeing it actually happening with no to very little exaggerations. That is where I feel Hollywood falls short and puts allot of drama in a film that really did not occur in the true event. If there were exaggerations in this movie they were seamless and not over done. If you have a chance to see this movie I feel it is ""a must see movie"" you will not be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Realistic, bleak, but ultimately life-affirming.","Disaster films have an odd reputation, often merely dismissed as popcorn fodder, so it's strange to have a film billed as such but to put character and drama over spectacle. Then again, as it's based on a true story, it's probably unfair to label 'The Impossible' as such a movie because the plight of the characters is at its heart throughout the entire duration. Perhaps this film is best described as a family drama with elements of disaster, then.The Boxing Day tsunami was one of those events that put our lives into perspective, and the film achieves the same feat. Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts play the parents of three children who decide to spend an exotic Christmas in Thailand. Suitcases are unpacked, presents are exchanged, but the sense of impending disaster is overwhelmingly unsettling. When the inevitable does happen, the following 15 minutes are intense, realistic and terrifying; an onslaught of terrific practical effects and incredible sound design. However, after that concentrated outburst, the drama shifts down a gear to a more intimate, personal level, which is no less frightful.That is why this film shines; it's about the smaller picture. By focusing on the survival of this one family rather than the scale of the event itself, a better, and more human, representation of the disaster is displayed. The performances from the central cast are nothing short of spectacular, especially Tom Holland, who carries the film for a hefty chunk of the running time with a gravitas that many older actors would fail to achieve.Many criticisms have been made in the press about the anglicisation of the story; in reality, the family was Spanish. To me, that seemed to be a decision to globalise this story to the maximum amount of people, a decision that was warranted in my eyes. Thus, the main issue with the film was the score to be unnecessarily overriding in certain scenes, adding an unwanted sentimentality to the film. The scenes which worked best were confrontational, uncompromising and, you guessed it, without a swelling orchestra. Nevertheless, this is a minor gripe considering that this is a film where tears are wholeheartedly justified.My Blog - Celluloid Ramblings . blogspot. co . uk",7.0,Anonymous,History
Watts and Holland own it...One of the Best Pictures of the Year!,"A film that captures real life the way J.A. Bayona captures it in his newest film The Impossible is a rare occurrence in filmmaking. Not only does he pay respect to the countless victims that were lost in the devastating tragedy, he makes artistic choices and liberties only the most seasoned directors can take. Starring Academy Award Nominee Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor, the film tells the TRUE story about a family vacationing in Thailand when one of the worst natural disasters of our time separates them.In the opening credits of the film, Bayona tells the audience that the story is true, but what may bother viewers and critics is how coincidental and inflated the story can seem. If it weren't in fact true, the film would fail within the first few moments. It's the notion that this did occur that demonstrates and heightens the execution of Bayona and writer Sergio G. Sanchez so brilliantly. The Impossible is the most emotional and devastating picture seen since Paul Greengrass' United 93 (2006). In the first several minutes, I was already in tears. Letting up only for short breaths, I feel like I didn't stop crying the entire time. I was invested, full body and soul, riding among the victims in a frightening state of mind. I could only imagine myself there, terrifyingly so and with appreciation now that I wasn't. The brave and committed performance by Naomi Watts is the miracle of the film and possibly the entire year. Watts falls into the role of ""Maria"" with perfect precision and accuracy. As a person who's only been a father for a year-and-a-half, Watts puts me right in the moment of unimaginable fear and pain. An Oscar-caliber turn as I've ever witnessed. The entire first half of the film is shared with Tom Holland, a child actor that can only be described as well beyond his years. Holland is motivated and equally as afflicting as Watts. A performance like his can only lead to more roles for him in the future. Ewan McGregor, who unbeknownst to me as gone this long without receiving any type of Oscar attention is pure magic. He shows an effortless approach as Henry, a father desperate to find his family. If there's one poor criticism about the film it's the first half of the film, where Holland and Watts dominate, is so gut-wrenching and brilliant that when McGregor and his story enter the screen, it unfortunately just pales by comparison. McGregor isn't given the most of character development to chew through but it's still an admirable work.Cinematographer Oscar Faura's orange and yellow camera work demands the utmost attention from the viewer, gaining a near first-person view of what could have been. It's a technical achievement of the highest levels. Fernando Velasquez's somber score will only build the tears even more as your catapulted through this reenactment of terror. J.A. Bayona's direction is simplistic but delivered with reverence. A fine directorial turn.This is a film that must be experienced by all. As you lay in your cozy beds tonight, take your loved ones for granted as they walk by you, and breath the air you so blindly feel entitled to, think about if at one moment, one single moment, from now, it was all gone. The Impossible dared me to be a better human being, a notion not many films will or attempt to convey. I'll try to listen.It's one of the best pictures of the year!Read more reviews @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)",8.0,Anonymous,History
emotional roller-coaster - but average script,"I watched The Impossible with a clear intention to remain a little emotionally detached. I knew from the trailer that a disaster was imminent from the word go, so I braced myself for impact and kept my fingers crossed that Ewan Mcgregor was going to give more than the lack luster performance that i feel like I've been growing accustomed to. Okay, so i was crying from about 10 minutes into the film. While McGregor is credible, although still not a return to form, the real performance here is from Naomi Watts. She is gripping to watch, and lends credibility to the rest of the cast as she watches the world fall apart around her. I winced, squirmed and spent many minutes forgetting to breathe. An emotional roller-coaster which, while somewhat lacking in depth in storyline, more than makes up for it with a strong edit. Great job with an average script.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Emotional and Epic,"With it being a New Year, I thought I'd go and see a comedy to kick off the 2013 film season. Unfortunately there wasn't any comedies showing at my Cinema so I ended up seeing this film about the 2004 South-East Asian Tsunami which killed over 250,000 people and displaced millions. Not what I had in mind as a cheery film, but oh well....So basically we have a family that include married couple Henry and Maria Bennett (played Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts), a classic middle- class couple, as suggested by the fact they spend most their time on the plane travelling to Thailand worrying if they set the alarm to their house back in Japan, and also their three sons all string sentences together without saying ''Bruv'' or ''Innit'', so they must be Middle- Class. Anyway the family arrive at their resort in Thailand, and all is going pleasantly when.....yes arriving in spectacular fashion, almost like the rise of Godzilla, the Tsunami arrives and decimates everything in site. The family is split in the wreckage of it all and the film then deals with them all trying ti locate each other, if they all managed to survive that is....The film was actually very good, a simple search story made gargantuan by the amazing effects used to portray the actual Tsunami, it literally comes at such a speed and power that leaves you in bewilderment and gives you a better idea that news reports of what it was all like at the time. They also have the classic ''Titanic'' Hollywood orchestra as the soundtrack whilst this is happening just to add to the emotional intensity, alongside top notch acting from McGregor, Watts and Tom Holland as 12 year old son Lucas. The main complaint, and flaw of the film, however lies in the fact we hardly see any actual Asian people, in a film about an Asian tragedy. The main Asians in the film are tribesmen and doctors who seem unable to apply composure or logic to any of the hectic situations occurring, we don't see any Asian characters searching frantically for loved ones or showing pain at losing those they love, unlike our Western Heroes here.So overall, aside from the debatable premise of casting for the film, which you'd expect from Hollywood, it remains a good, epic, emotional film if you watch it for what it is.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,History
Sentimental glop -,"Tsunami hits, 240k people die, let's make a movie about the rich British family who suffer horrible trauma (injuries! non permanent, tho...separation! for a few days...fatigue! dirt!) and who manage, somehow, to piece their lives back together once reunited, whisked by private plane covered by insurance to Singapore for medical care, then home to UK to resume their luxe little lives. OK, good for them, comes of living in the 1st world, having tons of disposable income, etc. But it makes for a boring movie, which it shouldn't have been since it's based on real events. I kept waiting to FEEL something, at least something other than wow! at the special effects. A much more interesting focus would be to delve into the lives of some of the local populace, the ones not-so-rich, not-so-white, no-so-insured. The ones, say, who lost homes, families, communities, livelihoods, health, virtually EVERYTHING that matters, and somehow neglected to have some Zurich-based insurance company covering all misfortunes. That scenario happened too, for real - and in numbers vastly surpassing the Tourist Trauma that is all this pricey film appears to care about. Those stories would be vastly more interesting, and would have made a far superior film.",2.0,Anonymous,History
"While Trying to Recreate the Horror of 2004, Bayona Manages to Do 'The Impossible'!","A married doctor couple, Maria (Watts) and Henry (McGregor), has brought their three young boys on a much-needed vacation to the coast of the Indian Ocean. In a scenic resort, the brood fit in for a gorgeous afternoon poolside with nary a Christmas tree in sight and their holiday plans prepared for a beautiful vacation. That day, however, was not to be the one they had hoped for.A mere fifteen minutes into the film, a slight breeze catches Maria's hair, quickly turning into a whipping gust of wind. It's one thing to hear stories of tsunamis and the spontaneity with which they appear, but it's another thing to see it happen in front of you. No warning. The ground rumbles, vacationers scatter and scream, their world about to be turned upside down, forever. From complete relaxation to impending death. No warning.Separated by rushing water and dangerous terrain, Maria and their eldest son Lucas (Holland) travel as best they can on her severely wounded leg towards civilization and hopefully help. The first half of the film focuses on this pair as if Henry and their other two children were swept into the sea like so many others. Henry, however, is still alive and his chapter begins at the halfway point when he tries to seek Maria and Lucas out. From then on, it becomes about the apparently insurmountable logistics involved in getting this family back together.Technically impeccable, 'The Impossible' gives the brutal caprice of nature its due, never romanticizing it or demonizing it. It begins as a steady radio dial, suddenly and violently spun into fits of static and garbled chaos. Director Juan Antonio Bayona conducts this symphony with a steady hand and a wonderful visual eye. He spins the focus in on a single family caught up in the disaster, personalizing the horror and bringing it home in unashamedly melodramatic fashion on its very own tidal wave of emotion. While doing so, Bayona creates one of the most traumatizing and realistic disaster sequences in history. Avoiding the temptation to fill his piece with dramatic underscore that swells as our protagonists are tumbled in the muddy waters of the invading ocean, Bayona removes all musical accompaniment for this portion permitting loudness and utter silence to fill our senses along with visual stimuli that will leave you scarcely able to breathe. This swift wrath of nature is expertly realized, but the heart of the film is in its characters and how they respond to the betrayal of the world around them.Naomi Watts, in her career best performance, expresses the rooted emotions of a mother both physically and emotionally, filling the film with so much fearlessness and unshakable motivation, that she enraptures the audience with her survival instincts. Ewan McGregor provides able support as the distressed father and is extremely competent. Tom Holland delivers one of the strongest juvenile debuts seen in years, conveying a complex series of emotions with natural serenity.The Impossible separates itself from the other disaster films by focusing not just on the scale of the mayhem, but the intimacy of the struggle. Yes it takes us back to an epic nightmare that was the Boxing Day tsunami of 2004, but the flashback is vertiginous and horrible and oddly poetic.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Good But not Great,"This is an extremely heavy movie and is extremely difficult to watch. It is not a fun watch but that isn't a bad thing. I think it is actually a positive because if there is something to be said about this film I think that it really tries it's hardest to capture the emotional gravity of events like this.It doesn't sugar coat things for the most part so scenes are graphic and uncomfortable to watch.I think Naomi Watts was fantastic. Everyone else was okay.Before watching I thought to my self that this whole premise was a weird ""in"" to this story. Why are we telling a story about a white family not native to Thailand when there are thousands and thousands of Thai stories that are also important to hear. Then I was even more confused when I found out the family was Spanish? Why cast English people. Apparently the real Maria wanted Naomi Watts but I think everyone involved probably thought it wouldn't be as marketable as a ""foreign language film"". So that was all confusing to me.The script or more so the dialogue was something. I don't know who is the blame. It could be the actors delivering the lines flat or it could be that the dialogue is bad. It is definitely over written. People don't talk like that. Lines feel like the come from a piece of paper.I also think this could have been trimmed. The pacing was strange to me. I was expecting to get to know the family more so I was shocked when things played out like they did. Some scenes could have definitely been shaved a little bit. And unfortunately the way this movie is there is a part in it which feel like Groundhog Day. The movie almost resets. Which slaughters the already unsteady pacing.You could watch it if it interests you. It is absolutely devastating and I do think that the film makers made a real effort to show the heartbreak and horror that this event caused. I just think it lets it's self down in some areas.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Spectacular as well dramatic story based on facts and masterfully directed by Juan Antonio Bayona,"In 2004 , a devastating tsunami hit southeast Asia , this is one family's true story of survival . The story of a tourist family (the family on which this story is based upon were present during the whole shooting process) in Thailand , they are an ordinary family called Maria (Naomi Watts), Henry (Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts previously had an on-screen relationship in ¨Stay¨, 2005) and their three kids travel to Thailand to spend Christmas . Then they are caught in the destruction and chaotic aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami . It follows Maria and her son Lucas (Tom Holland) , not knowing where is the father and if two younger sons are dead or alive . However , nothing is more powerful than the human spirit. Who will survive ?It's a grade A picture , a gem , absorbing , riveting , highly moving , incredibly tense . This is a psychological/survival/thrilling drama in which a family enjoying their holiday become involved into a terrible tragedy . It is a smart and sensitive thriller filled with intense drama , thrills , emotion , tear-jerker and pretty entertaining though overlong . This nail-biter is a tightly-knit drama centered on the relentless survival-fight , as it follows the seriously wounded Maria/Naomi Watts and her eldest son Lucas/Tom Holland , as they struggle to safety . The picture makes up for it with an evolving atmosphere of anxiety and fear . Everything in Juan Antonio Bayona 's impressive film looks so real that you might think it's a high resolution videotape of a tsunami . The crew filmed partially on location at the actual resort, since rebuilt, where the Belon family was vacationing when the tsunami hit ; for the tsunami destruction scenes, a scaled model of the resort was used . Interesting screenplay by Sergio G. Sánchez from a story by María Belón and being based upon on true events , as the real family that the main characters are based on are in fact Spanish but living in Japan at the time of the Tsunami and many of the extras are actual survivors of the tsunami . Lavishly produced by Enrique López Lavigne , Jaime Ortiz de Artiñano , Javier Ugarte and Belen Atienza, in fact , the producers of the film heard an interview on Spanish radio where the family told their story of surviving the Tsunami and decided to make a film based on it. Top-notch acting by Naomi Watts , for the underwater scenes, Naomi was strapped in a rotating chair , while filming, Watts couldn't hold her breath any longer and she gave the 'stop' sign. Instead of stopping, the chair started spinning the other way around . Later it was revealed that it was a technical error and Watts stated the she felt very scared and hated the chair for that reason. There is the urgent hand-held camera-work, a trademark refined and perfected by cameraman Oscar Faura , which lends an air of pseudo-documentary authenticity to carefully staged reconstructions, putting us right there in the huddle of the action . Furthermore , an emotive as well as enjoyable musical score by Fernando Velazquez .The motion picture was compellingly directed by Juan Antonio Bayona who proved his usual aesthetics and nail-biting filmmaking as well as he formerly made in ¨the orphanage¨ . In this excellent film of 2013 , Bayona has directed 1 actress to an Academy Award-nominated performance: Naomi Watts (Best Actress, Lo impossible or the impossible (2012). Rating : Above average , a magnificent film . Essential and indispensable seeing . The picture will appeal to Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor fans .",8.0,Anonymous,History
An uplifting movie with great performances,"¨The most scary bit for me was when I came up and I was all on my own.¨The Impossible is Spanish director, Juan Antonio Bayona's, follow up to his 2007 hit El Orfanato (The Orphanage). He has decided to change the genre, but still manages to direct a great film. This is a very powerful and emotional family drama about the true story of the tsunami that hit the coast of Asia in 2004 and a family's struggle for survival. The film is based on the main character's story: Maria Belon and the screenplay was adapted by Sergio Sanchez who had previously worked with Bayona in The Orphanage as well. The story was really well developed although sometimes the film felt a little over the top with the melodrama. Films always add a few elements to spice up the story a bit so I can't say how true this movie is to what actually happened in real life, but what I can say is that the Spanish family this film is based on is played here by a British one so there are some changes. Anyway, The Impossible works really well as a family drama and many people left the theater with tears in their eyes. This is a tear-jerker, so if you're an emotional person this film will pull your strings, especially through Naomi Watts's performance who gives a powerful and a very physically challenging one. Her Oscar nomination was very well earned although she probably won't be the winner. The film also succeeds in the technical aspect as the tsunami is beautifully shot and one of the greatest scenes in the movie considering it is one of the worst national catastrophes of our time. The imagery will remain in your head.Henry (Ewan McGregor) and Maria (Naomi Watts) travel to Thailand for their Christmas holidays alongside their three children: Lucas (Tom Holland), Thomas (Samuel Joslin), and Simon (Oaklee Pendergast). They are having the perfect family vacation in the beautiful coastline of Thailand in a lovely villa. Along with several other tourists they spend Christmas Eve together and the next morning the kids open their gifts. Everything seems to be going lovely, and then all of a sudden out of the blue a giant wave comes roaring across the entire coastline taking everything along its path. We follow the wave as it washes over the entire place, then the camera follows Maria and Lucas as the current has washed them far away from the villa. Maria is badly injured, but she is glad to have Lucas by her side. This is the story of their fight for survival and struggle to reunite with the rest of their family. The tsunami scene is terrifying as we see the terrible effects it had on the population, and isn't an easy watch, but it is worth it because it has an uplifting story.Naomi Watts has been receiving a lot of recognition for her work in this film, and she is truly amazing, but I thought Ewan McGregor also delivers a great performance as well and many people have ignored him. The children in this film are also great here, especially Tom Holland who should have received a nomination for his work in this film. He shares a great chemistry with Naomi Watts and holds up his performance to hers. My only complaint for this movie is that it goes overboard with the melodrama and intends to have everyone leave the theater with tears in their eyes, but it truly is an uplifting story. It is worth the watch and I recommend it because it reminds us that with faith we can achieve impossible things, and that we shouldn't take things for granted because things can change drastically from one moment to the next. Life is fragile, but love can conquer all.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,History
"the parallel world where white people get beaten by the Asian nature disaster, but only white people were injured.","This film is another example of great acting trumped by white washed theme. As a Thai person who grew up during the incident, I had to deduct points for the strange story. I hate to say that production design, editing, and script were all really bad. It was like the parallel world where white people get beaten by the Asian nature disaster, but only white people were injured.1.) The visuals of the town during that time were incorrect.While it is true that foreigners were strained, injured, or died during this incident, Maria was separated from her husband for only two days. It was during the time which she was badly injured and stayed in the hospital. Therefore, Holland and McGregor's storylines were written by the studio and were mostly inaccurate. As someone who was a teen during the tragic event, I can say that McGregor's story about melting-down calling his home or having access to transportation were unlikely to happen during those two days. I remember that it took a week for the locals to reconnect with the outside world because the tragedy had destroyed communication and transportation.2.) No harm was done to local people?I never saw local people being injured in this film. However, this is impossible as we faced the same tragedy, and their numbers were almost double that of the tourists. I saw my people looking clean and going about their business like nothing had happened. I felt awkward to see Tom Holland's point of view, in which he saw only white people dying on the streets or Asian people running around in perfect condition, was unlikely.Despite the strange plot of Holland and McGregor's storylines, I enjoyed their acting skills of father-mother-son dynamic on screen.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Emotional.,"Based on the tsunami of 2004, this film offers a look at the devastation and impact of this natural disaster through the eyes of the Belon family.This film oozes emotion through every scene; not only from the actors but the audience. At the cinema, I heard sniffles, crying and even yelps of sadness. Which shows how this film can affect people! I felt myself connect with the characters and was completely glued to the screen throughout.Nice performances throughout helped shape the story. In particular, Tom Holland gives a realistic and emotional performance.A film suitable for all ages and one which everyone should see.

An Emotional Journey Through the Human Spirit,"I offer two pieces of advice if going to see ""The Impossible."" 1) Bring Kleenex 2) Bring extra Kleenex.""The Impossible"" is the true story of the Belón family. Mother, father and three children who survived the devastating 2004 Tsunami which ripped apart south-east Asia. There has been some criticism that the film ""Hollywoodized"" the story by ""whitewashing"" the family, but clearly, they have not seen the film. The beauty of this story, written by María Belón and turned into a screenplay by Sergio G. Sánchez, may never have been able to be produced had they not been able to bring in big-name stars and get the funding for spectacular special effects, so one must forget the politics and just be truly happy this story made it to the big screen at all in a form which could touch a wide audience.Naomi Watts plays Maria Bennet who, along with her son Lucas, are separated from her husband, Henry (Ewan McGregor) and her other two sons, Thomas and Simon, after the tsunami hits the resort where they were vacationing. This is the true story of how they miraculously survived and found each other.And a reminder of the hundreds of thousands that were not as fortunate.Watts has been nominated for both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for her riveting performance as Maria, and with reason. The amount of emotion and pain this woman pours into the role makes it easily one of the most heartbreaking of the year. Sadly, she is not a front-runner, but this performance is far more deserving than the woman who is.And I am not one who is generally terribly impressed by younger performers, but if there was any young actor this year who actually deserves an Oscar nomination, it is Tom Holland in the role of Lucas. The depth and feeling that this kid brings to his role is astonishing for someone of his age. Unlike the other young kid that was nominated this year, Holland actually showed some actual skill in his craft and not just merely being, well, a kid.This is not to overlook excellent performances as well by an incredible strong McGregor and, yes, the two younger actors that pulled in much of the emotional weight, Samuel Joslin and Oaklee Pendergast.""The Impossible"" is an extraordinary journey of the human spirit. Not always easy to watch, but the devastation and pain is worth experiencing. Through the love of this family and the efforts of the people of Thailand, you are brought into an emotional wave almost as strong as the horrific tsunami itself while it drags you through the heartbreak to the bitter end.Take my advice, bring extra Kleenex.",10.0,Anonymous,History

An average movie with one great ten minute sequence,"The term ""disaster movie"" tends to conjure up images of campy and disposable entertainment involving killer asteroids and doomed ship voyages, so attaching it to a film like The Impossible feels wrong, considering the terrible true-life circumstances on which it's based. Those circumstances involve the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami that killed an estimated 280,000 people in 14 different countries. Specifically, the film tells the story of the Belon family, British tourists who were separated from each other when the tsunami hit their beachside resort in Thailand on December 26th.The bulk of the film features the parallel stories of Henry (played by Ewan McGregor) and his two sons struggling to reunite with his doctor wife, Maria (played by Naomi Watts), and the couple's oldest son, Lucas (played by impressive newcomer Tom Holland). The Impossible's focal point is obviously the tsunami event and the sequence is quite impressively executed by Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona. Mostly eschewing special effects and relying on recreating the spectacle in the second largest water tank in the world, the ten minute sequence is gripping and immersive, realistically conveying the magnitude, violence, and unpredictability of mother nature. The aftermath of the big disaster (meaning the vast majority of the movie) inevitably feels somewhat anti-climatic, as the family makes the slow, arduous journey back to one another. Bayona briefly livens things up during one of these scenes with a gruesome close-up shot of a thigh wound suffered by Maria that elicited collective gasps and squirms from the theatre audience. That shot apparently caused a couple of moviegoers at The Impossible's TIFF world premiere screening the day before to actually pass out. In either the same scene or one shortly before or shortly after it, the director also made what I thought was an odd decision in showing one of Maria's breasts being exposed to her son because one of the straps on her top had broken off. Considering the hell the tsunami had just put them through, the scenario was completely plausible and the real-life Maria was on set for most of the lengthy seven month shoot (ironically, bad weather slowed down production), so I can't even entertain the notion that the shot was exploitative. Even still, it just seemed like a very strange creative choice on Bayona's part.Watts and McGregor give sound performances in roles I'd classify as unremarkable, especially McGregor's. Watts has a lot more heavy lifting to do, particularly during the numerous scenes where she's bedridden. Some early reviews of The Impossible wildly speculated on Oscar nominations for their performances, which would devalue that whole spectacle even more in my eyes than it already is. Holland gets more screen time than either star and acquits himself very well. The Impossible's frequent reliance on the youngster's point of view, coupled with the spectacle of the tsunami, also lends the film an unmistakable Spielbergian quality (you can also find it in the occasionally overly manipulative musical score).I found myself intermittently more emotionally invested with the characters than I would have expected, but The Impossible ends up feeling like little more than average entertainment with one dynamic ten minute segment.( More of my reviews at Mediaboymusings.blogspot.ca )",6.0,Anonymous,History
Strong Performances Carry Film,"The Impossible (2012)*** (out of 4)A British couple (Naomi Watts, Ewan McGregor) take their three sons to South Asia for a vacation and soon they're separated by the biggest tsunami ever on record. This film tells the true story of a real couple caught up in the December 26, 2004. THE IMPOSSIBLE is a good movie but I think it falls well short of being great, which is too bad because there are some very memorable thing scattered throughout the picture. We can start with the tsunami sequence, which was just downright chilling and you have to give director Juan Bayona credit for really putting the viewer right there in the horror of things. I'm not going to sit here and say it makes you feel as if you were really there because nothing could do that. However, for something not real, I think the entire sequence was very scary and it makes you shocked that anyone could survive such abuse to their body. I think the film has its heart in the right place but I don't think it really makes the story flow. I found the film and story to work itself out way too easily. I know that might sound weird and perhaps the truth of the situation was this easy but everything just seemed a tad bit rushed and it seemed to happen way too easily. Another problem I had is that I really didn't emotionally connect with anyone involved in the story. Yes, the true story was something incredible and yes it was remarkable what these people went through. You still need to do more than just tell a story. As a film you need to get that across and I don't think this one did a good job at that. The performances are exceptionally good and this includes Tom Holland as the young boy who gets separated with his mother. Both Watts and McGregor were exceptionally good as the parents. THE IMPOSSIBLE is certainly worth watching due to that horrific tsunami scene as well as the performances but I think the story could have been told better.",,Anonymous,History
Juan Antonio Bayona knows how to make a fine film.,"Juan Antonio Bayona returns to the screen for the second time, after his first feature, the subtitled ""The Orphanage."" This time, he still captures a feeling of sheer terror, but from something completely different. Based on the true story of one of many families affected by one the biggest tsunamis to hit Asia in 2004. The consequences of the tsunami, and also the undying hope in a rapidly closing dark hole that they are all still alive.Bayona really shined in this film. He knows how to direct actors, set up shots and craft a fine film. However, he was unable to salvage realism in the sappy, melodramatic scenes and more importantly the last 20 minutes. But then again, it's hard to find any director who could make those scenes any less than what they were, which is those exactly.The dialog was gripping, there were a few unexpected developments in the screenplay, which poised a great deal of excitement. It grips you and never lets you go. I would say captivating, but that would be an understatement. Go see this film, it attained the perfect balance between being too exploitive and too childish. Not the best film of the year, due to a few scenes and maybe a bit on the children's acting side, but besides that, it is a great film.",7.0,Anonymous,History
They forgot the tsunami,"I just don't understand how this movie got good reviews.Imagine if James Cameron had filmed The Titanic entirely as closeups of people suffering in the hallways!!! Thats how the makers of The Impossible would have done The Titanic!!!! Closeups of people suffering as the hallways filled with water, then closeups of people suffering in lifeboats. With an initial 10 second opening shot of the ship, the ocean and other passengers.I expected that this movie would be about one family's experiences set against a backdrop of unique natural tragedy that caused 400,000 deaths and left 500,00 homeless. After all, thats what made their story unique. Unfortunately the makers of this film pretty much omitted the tsunami from this movie. Also omitted, the ocean, beaches and all the people in Asia.While the actual tsunami was a natural catastrophe of epic proportions, occurring in one of the worlds most exotic, beautiful and tranquil locations, the tsunami is only seen in this film as a wave entering the swimming pool area of the hotel.After that its pretty much all closeups of Naomi Watts suffering and screaming. Except for the cuts and bruises, she could be in any puddle of water, say in a bad rain at a Florida Motel. Strangely, even though hundreds of thousands of other people were swept away, Watts is always alone, under muddy water, walking out of a swamp, sitting in a tree. She and her son are pretty much the only ones in the first half of the movie. Nor are there any buildings, cars, or anything else that might have been hit by the wave.When she reaches the hospital there are a couple of dozen extras to represent the million people injured and dead. The hospital scene could have been filmed on Saturday night at any Brooklyn Hospital except that, in the movie, the scene was too calm. After 45 minutes of this we get closeups of Ewan McGregor yelling and suffering. Thats pretty much it, yelling and suffering, with cameras on their faces, almost never a reference to the scale and circumstances of the unique and colossal tragedy thats the basis for this film. We're left with one family having a bad day somewhere with palm trees.",2.0,Anonymous,History
Beautifully Realistic,"When I saw the trailer for this film I did not think much of it. The trailer seemed like a spoiler and left me disinterested. Do not be disinterested! wow.What an epic window into a tragedy most people would have flicked through on the news years ago without any true understanding of the emotional trauma the individuals involved went through. I feel this movie gets it 100% right. Maybe because it was a true story, maybe because there was brilliant acting even from the young kids in the film, perhaps the subject matter, Whatever the case this movie grabbed my emotions from the very beginning and did not let go for the duration of the film.I keep seeing reviews from critics arguing that the film is slightly racist as it centers around a white privileged family and not enough emphasis was placed on the fact that Thai people suffered also. This is absolute rubbish, the film is simply accurate, I have been to Thailand multiple times and nothing in the film seemed out of place. I have even been to hospital in Thailand ... thats what it is like. Lots of white people with the white people, why? because there is more chance you will be able to speak to the people around you. It just makes sense. I love Thai people but I don't speak Thai, If I was stuck in a hospital surrounded by people speaking another language it would just be confusing and confusion is not something that needs amplification in a disaster. Most of the critics have probably never even been out of their house let alone to Thailand. The movie was focused around what one family saw. That is what they saw, end of story. I didn't see any racism I just saw people helping people.This film gets it 100%. Its a deeply emotional story that made me appreciate my life more at the end of it. If you are a critic and you are talking about insignificant stupid things like how Ewans hair looked too perfect after the tsunami then you have completely missed the point of the movie. Just watch it and let it take you where it took me. If a movie makes you appreciate life more at the end of it, then it gets a 10. enough said.",10.0,Anonymous,History
good but too much (?),"A wonderful true story, some great actors, great music and shooting makes it a very good dramatic movie. We have to acknowledge the work of all the crew and researches for this movie as we can see it in the end titles but... But if this story is true why add so much dramatic effects to it? We already are living the drama alongside with this family; more than a nightmare it's a radical change in their personal life and in History too. I personally think that the music (a great score by the way) is just too much, and the casting is not really fair with this Spanish family... But maybe are they trying to put this story at some universal point of view? Kind of an ""evry one"" story and not only their?We didn't forget the 26th/12/2004, so why push it that way? And do not write on screen ""true story"" on the beginning when you put at the end ""inspired by"" and dedicate the last minute of the end credit (a few stand to see this!) to the personal thanks of Maria...See it as a movie, and you will enjoy your time, see it as a biography of the events and you will be disappointed.

A Story of hope.,"The 2004 tsunami shocked the world when nature displayed its destructive force, killing nearly 228,000 people and becoming one of deadliest natural disasters.'The Impossible' takes a look at one family's fight for survival against all odds. Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts star as Maria and Henry Bennett, who - along with their three children - vacation at the Orchid Beach Resort in Thailand. Just two days into their holiday, a massive tsunami destroyed the area.With the family being separated, their quest for survival begins, and the film becomes a story of hope. It is touching, heartbreaking, heartwarming, emotional and inspirational all in one. The film is incredibly well made and so realistic that some scenes were actually very difficult to watch. The production design is fantastic, along with practical and miniature effects.The performances from the entire cast are exceptional, and young Tom Holland in particular does a wonderful job in a very demanding role. 'The Impossible' illustrates how life can become a nightmare in the blink of an eye, and how people come together in the aftermath of a devastating natural disaster. Oh, and you'd better keep a box of tissues handy.In my opinion, 'The Impossible' is still one of the best and most incredible disaster movies ever made.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Moving film with outstanding performances and a story that everyone should be told,"This film is so hard-hitting and most of that comes from the foreboding at the beginning. However, despite knowing what is going to happen it still shocks you and the foreboding only helps add to your experience. Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts both give fantastic performances in their roles but are outshone by the child cast. Oaklee Pendergast and Samuel Joslin are brilliant and I would have liked to see more of them in the story and Tom Holland is perfectly cast as the older son Lucas. His acting is phenomenal for his young age and I would definitely like to see him get an award for this performance. A lot of people have slated the film for focusing on one vacationing family instead of the local people who were affected also but I believe that you understand the scale of the disaster despite this. It was a lot more gory than I expected and although I have seen gory horror films (Saw, Se7en etc.) I found this much harder to watch because you know it is based on a true story and when watching, due to the amazing performances you really connect with the characters. My friend was close to leaving the cinema he found it so hard to watch but afterwards he said it was worth getting through and he was glad he watched the rest. There is also some nudity, but it is not sexual and whilst I don't think all of it was necessary, it only adds to the sense of disaster. Juan Antonio Bayona's direction is fantastic and the cinematography is breath-taking, despite the tragedy being told it is quite beautiful. The effects are also incredible and this helps to bring home the impact the tsunami had. I didn't know much of the tragedy as I was only young when it happened, but this film really opened my eyes and helped me to understand how tragic the event was. The performances and the story of 'The Impossible' is so moving and the music adds to this, out of the five of us who went to see it, only one of us didn't cry and she was still shaken by it. I recommend taking tissues just in case. The whole audience in the cinema was entranced by this film which you do not see often. You really connect with the characters and the story hits hard. Although this film has a big emotional impact however, underneath it has a lovely message about the amazing endurance of humanity and the love between families that can withstand so much. This is not an easy film to watch but I completely recommend it, to the point where I think is should be compulsory for all to watch it.For more film reviews see deannareviews.blogspot.co.uk",7.0,Anonymous,History

The viewer is left to wince in pain at every gory detail as the vacationers deal selfishly with the disaster.Characters are occasionally heroic, but usually stupid, and always end up in ridiculously convenient situations. Almost nothing is learned about the multitudes of real people who were affected by this tragedy.There is only one scene worth watching... where the husband borrows a cell phone. Even that scene ends in a way that seems phony and smarmy.This has a 7.6 rating? I can only imagine that many people are sympathetic to the victims of the disaster and refuse to dis on a movie based on that.",1.0,Anonymous,History
A beautiful film with universal appeal,"I responded to someone who thought this movie had racist overtones. I thought it was a beautiful film with superb direction and acting.I just saw the movie. First of all, the medium of this illustration is film. Producers and and other involved in this kind of art have to consider the mode and the way characters are able to portray the story, not just the material. I suppose the most accurate method for delivering the story would have been to have the original family star in the film. Race certainly wouldn't have been a factor in this case, would it?When viewing art, yes you consider the artist and where he came from, his own personal story. But how far do you take this idea that 'race' should be as much a part of this story as the family and what happened to them? Should the director also be of this 'race'? Should they all meditate around the ideas that race might play? Remember, film is a form of art. One with limitations, such as time. And art also has certain rules. In film, like a ballet, you're dealing with a medium that uses time in a very different way than traditional art. Time is depicted, not in a linear fashion, but as a moment in and of itself. A ballet isn't made up of each formal move and the stories of the dancers themselves. Movement in this way is meant to capture all of these pieces as interpretive experience which can say something quite true in 2 hours about something that took a lifetime to construct: the struggle between grace and nature for example. Art in this way moves our soul, not our logic or our understanding of the progression of things in the 'real' world.I'm sure casting is a tough job, but Naomi Watts and Ewan McGreggor both have incredible resumes and were very qualified to play these roles. These are creative decisions, not social ones. There was no 'social' argument here. A Japanese family could have played these roles just as well if the actors were decided to embrace and commit the direction of this creative work. Yes it was a true story, and because of that the creative process demands certain considerations. But as far as critiquing western culture, your argument lacks premise. The family the film was based on is Spanish. And if my geography is correct, Spain IS a western country.Culturally speaking, like every country in Europe, they have their own way of life yes, but they're still largely western in their thinking, their play, their political ideology. But once again, this film isn't about 'Spanish"" culture. It's about a family. Yes they were Spanish, but as such a family they have their own familial nuances and particular way of life that I'm sure is different enough from other families in Spain to make them personal. Did it matter that the actors in the film didn't speak Spanish? They were on vacation. They played soccer. Celebrated Christmas. Played ping pong. Drank soda. And they enjoyed the amenities provided for people who are accustomed to western culture. So the fact that the cultural experience of the family in the film seemed to be British (Ewan McGregor's character was obviously Scottish) isn't in any way a distraction from what actually happened to the Belon family. I agree casting for Lucas might have yielded better results, but the outcome of the experience portrayed is unchanged.So the premise that this film somehow falls short of a narrative accurately depicting some 'racial' truth about Maria and Henry Belon and their children is just completely absurd. The film is a narrative about deep suffering, courage, love, ... a family's desperate struggle to find each other. The husbands undying devotion to his wife. The wife's bleeding heart to help others in need. To demonstrate that character for her son. To overcome her own internal fears. And somewhat about how they perceived this new devastated world they found themselves in. How to relate to others. How to cross a language barrier. How to let strangers take care of them. These ideas in fact aren't 'western' at all. They're Universal. If you can't see that, you should spend a little more time studying these disciplines, art, culture, psychology. Before you try to impose something as controversial as race into a conversation that obviously affected the readers in a very personal way. One of the gentleman who responded on the 'Boards' actually went THROUGH this disaster, like the Belon family.",9.0,Anonymous,History

The savage force,"I was in the Far East a few months after the 2004 Tsunami. I stayed in an island that was relatively only mildly touched by the disaster. The locals would not go to the beach and it was largely deserted.The Impossible is based on true events. The family concerned were actually Spanish.Maria (Naomi Watts) and Henry (Ewan McGregor) and their three young children are holidaying in Khao Lak, Thailand for Christmas. Suddenly the hotel is hit by a Tsunami. The family are seperated. Maria and eldest son Lucas (Tom Holland) are on their own. Maria is badly injured but they need to get to safety and they do not know what happened to the rest of the family.The film spends no time in scene setting. The disaster happens straight away and it is well staged. The movie is split into two. You really do wonder what happened to Henry and the other two children as the focus is on Maria and Henry.Only later do we see Henry and the other children survive as he tries to search for Maria and Lucas. By this time she is desperately ill in hospital.The film has a harrowing performance from Watts. Holland rises to the challenge as a boy who tries to make himself useful in reuniting other families. His performance reminded me of the young Christian Bale in Empire of the Sun.If there is a criticism. It actually pulls back on the chaotic destruction and panic that existed in the region at the time. Villages and local families were destroyed. Many people were split up.

Cry Me a Tsunami,"Greetings again from the darkness. Director Juan Antonio Bayona and writer Sergio C Sanchez reunite for their follow-up to The Orphanage (2007). What separates this from the long list of disaster films is that it's exceedingly well made, it's based on a true story, and it puts a young actor in a role vital to the connection with audience.The real life Belon family from Spain have for some reason been presented here (by Spanish filmmakers) as the British Bennett's with Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts (as Henry and Maria). They are on vacation at a beach resort with their three boys Lucas (Tom Holland), Thomas (Samuel Joslin), and Simon (Oaklee Pendergast). In the beginning the resort plays like paradise. Unfortunately, this is Thailand in 2004 when one of the worst natural disasters of all-time hits ... a Tsunami with enormous force and monstrous waves.Filmed with remarkable intensity, we see Maria and Lucas (separated from the others) struggle mightily to survive and stay together. This 10 minute sequence leaves the audience spent and gasping for air. Rarely do we witness such realistic near-drownings on screen. The film soon breaks into two simultaneous acts: the fight for survival by Maria and Lucas; and the quest to find them by Henry, Thomas and Simon.The first half of the film is the strongest portion and it deals with the storm and it's aftermath. The second half is very emotional and focuses on the courage of Lucas and the strength of Maria. It's one of the most unique combination tales of survival and family love that we've seen. The filmmakers wisely choose to let the story follow the family and not throw in cheap parlor tricks like TV newscasts. We all remember those reports, and the actual film does a terrific job of recreating those images.Acting by the leads take this to elite status. Ewan McGregor turns in what is his best performance in quite some time. His phone call home scene is excruciating to watch. Naomi Watts delivers what is likely an Oscar nominated performance, despite being almost unrecognizable while laying in a hospital bed during much of the film. The real star and soul of the film is Tom Holland as the youngest son. His performance recalls that of Hailee Steinfeld in True Grit and Shailene Woodley in The Descendants ... two of the best ever child performances.Be forewarned. This one is a true tearjerker ... especially if you are a parent or grandparent. Keeping in mind that it's the true story of one family's ordeal makes a few scenes almost impossible to watch clear-eyed. The film ends with a photo of the Belon family ... perfect.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"One of my all-time favorite ""family"" movies","First of all: It is a movie made by white people for white people. That's why its about a white family. The target audience can relate better to a white family. That's all. No disrespect or racism. The Asian people in the movie are all represented very well and genuine. There are no ""evil"" looters or whatever. They all are friendly, helpful and competent people.The fact that ""the impossible"" is about a white family is not a reason to vote the movie down. Please stop it.For me it is one of the best movies ever. I love the performances of every single actor. I love the cinematography and the score. Yes it pushes the emotions a little bit over the top, but exactly that's cinema for and ""the impossible"" is perfect cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Heartbreaking,"I had to watch this as part of my work, noting every single sound. The sound of the water, the breaking of branches to bones and each and every cry. Now, a film that showcases a tragedy front and centre, has been a real task for me. But I believe I experienced each moment to its fullest and felt the pain of the characters through it because of that. The performances of the three main cast and the direction carry the movie. Even though with lesser moments to shine McGregor ensures he comes out giving the most emotional scene in the movie that really broke me.Even with all the praise, I have for this movie, it did feel a bit problematic in how much of it is just the suffering of the tourists. Aside from some very brief stuff, everything was about white people. The family in focus would be the main focus, no problem. But there were a lot of other characters and most of it is centred around the tourists as if the native Thai people didn't endure the most of the tragedy of the tsunami. I believe it wouldn't have been as tasteless if it was made now.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Effective,"The Impossible is definitely an emotionally-manipulative film, as manipulative a film as one can get (hmm, perhaps not as much... just imagine Spielberg directing this!). But it was still very effective, the first act being among some of the best scenes of the year. The whole cast is great as well. Watts is fine here definitely, but I'm not sure she's much any better than McGregor, who has a phone call scene that is heartbreaking in its own right. The kids all hold their own as well and are overall pretty impressive. So this is definitely recommended, and while I'm sure many won't like just how shamelessly emotional it is, it's still worth it.",,Anonymous,History
"Review: The Impossible--A By The numbers, emotional journey of faith","Driving on intense emotional pain, explicit physical human damage and unbearable scenarios of brutal tragedy and deep suffering, The Impossible is a truly independent disaster movie minus any Hollywood trans fat. Absent of absurd fantastical elements plaguing high-end disaster movies in Hollywood, The Impossible is a film which uses the real disaster of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and one family's compelling true story of survival that surfaced cause of it. The Impossible may not be the best disaster movie ever made nor may it be the greatest parable for the strength of family and the bonds of community, but it sure as hell makes for one deeply satisfying emotional tale of endurance and hope. Re-Telling the story of Maria Belon's family's inexplicable survival, The Impossible is a retelling of one family's journey during one of the worst natural disasters ever recorded. Belon, along with her husband, were vacationing in Thailand from their busy lives back home in Japan. Caught without any warning, Belon and her family held on long and hard enough to live to tell the tale of there family's unbelievable tale of survival. Drenched with compelling special effects and outstanding stunt work, this was second in comparison to the stellar showcase of Naomi Watts' acting range. Being in front of the camera the longest and having her story told for the majority of the movie, Watts was harrowing as an injured mother clinging on to her life for the sake of her children. Accompanied by one of the stand-out performances by a newcomer this year, Tom Holland who plays Watts' son Lucas and her sole companion for the first half of the film, was completely on-point and the two were a dynamic acting duo. The two performances sparkled with life and ingenious moments of sheer beauty. Ewan McGregor did his best and held his own with what seemed like ridiculous plot- points for a father and very little screen time with two child actors (Oaklee Pendergast and Samuel Joslin) who were significantly overshadowed by Holland. The film itself owes great credit to its sophomore director Juan Antonia Bayona, whose direction is strategically planned and appreciated throughout the film. Dealing with a narrative with so much room for emotional manipulation, Bayona masterfully paces the film and its stars for small yet powerful instances of truly great human feats. The Impossible is a gut-wrenching and heart breaking marvel of a film. Layered with multiple challenges of the people who struggled to survive during a time of hardship and tragedy, The Impossible is a tale of true possible hope for the good in all people to shine. Challenging in not only content and the visuals it presents to the audience, the film is a challenge for people to accept and believe that good exists within everyone, especially during times of strife and extreme hardship. Physically challenging and magnificent, The Impossible is a true example of a small scale film doing it right with large scale heart.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Disaster,"This is based on a true event, but all from the perspective of one family. You may call this predictable and you won't be wrong about it, but it's not so much where it goes (or where the character go), but the journey itself. The visual effects are amazing, making it look and feel as if you were actually there. And all this is achieved without 3D (well at the time of writing, I haven't seen any production company making a 3D conversion on the movie).The acting is really good, but you could and should expect this. It's the bigger picture that counts anyway. The drama is heightened as much as the waves (or even more) and the conclusion will either leave you agitated or pleased. But it will not leave you without a feeling, that's for sure ...",8.0,Anonymous,History

This story was well told and even riveting at times. It is easy to watch footage of a natural disaster on TV and not be affected by it. This movie really hit home hard and gives you a deeper understanding of the suffering and struggle that is involved in the aftermath of such an event. As usual, Ewan Mcgregor and Naomi Watts were at the top of their game, but it was young Tom Holland who impressed more than anyone. This well acted drama is definitely worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Horrifying depiction of a tragic event,"A moment of guilt sunk in as I was watching Juan Antonio Bayona's ""The Impossible"". It's during the holiday scenes in the first five or so minutes of the film, where the tourists were happily lighting floating lanterns on the beach the night before Christmas '04. The calm before the storm.How haunting to remember, the happy faces of the tourists/couples as they bustle about partying and celebrating on the coasts of Thailand. How haunting to know that it would be one of their final nights, as I was, days before the horrific event, treading one of the very beaches struck hard by the waves. It's moments like that you ask yourself, do you truly have a life well-spent? Because it could be gone tomorrow, and there is nothing anyone can do about it.Yes, the trailers do indeed spoil the movie, but if you think about it, it doesn't matter if you've seen the trailer or not. We all saw the news footage during and after the disaster, and the images hauntingly burned in our brains as a memento of the merciless fury of mother nature.But Bayona does something else. The waves devastate the landscape, turning a land of pure beauty into a ruined wasteland beyond comprehension. Trees tumble, buildings are smashed, people are swept away and knocked around within the waves and debris. If that sounds horrific enough, Bayona doesn't hold back and we are treated to his recreation those cringing moments to gripping effect. Naomi Watts' blood-curdling scream as she clings on to dear life amidst raging waters and drifting debris sums the experience up. This scene makes the one in Clint Eastwood's ""Hereafter"" look like CliffNotes.After the tsunami comes another harrowing look at the aftermath. The survivors are meandering around, shell-shocked by the devastation and loss. The Thai hospitals are thrown into chaos as the hallways and rooms overflow with patients and corpses. These scenes are done tremendously well.The film's focus, however, is on a wealthy British family separated during the disaster. The mother (Watts) is swept away along with the eldest son (Tom Holland), and the father (Ewan McGregor) with the younger two sons. Each side fears the other is done for. It is a testament to their will and determination that all five manage to pull through to ultimately survive this ordeal. Holland and McGregor are very effective in their roles, but Watts gives the best performance, as a woman who has just seen the worst first-hand and still is determined to keep going.Yes, there are genre conventions. The real family which survived this have all been turned British for this film. Disaster genre conventions, especially fateful meetings and misses, are done to death in a lot of movies in a cheap attempt to exploit the emotion out of the audience. In this movie it's no exception, and the final reunion of the family, where they find each other, is frankly, ham-fistedly directed but well-acted. Aside from that minor gripe, the point is, Bayona uses this family's story as a central point to revisit the devastation of the tsunami aftermath. And he succeeds effortlessly at that.Three years ago, I saw this Chinese movie called ""Aftershock"" about the 1976 Tangshan Earthquake in China and it's ripples across a family. That movie used its effects horrifyingly well also, as per this one which ratchets up the cringe-factor up to 11. The PG-13 rating has never been more justified in recent times, with injury-related gore/nudity prevalent throughout the film to show the masses what's real. If you ever wondered if you spent enough time with your loved ones, this film will give you a reminder.A VERY GOOD disaster film.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"It's a Movie people, not a documentary! Get over yourselves!","I enjoyed the movie and NO, I didn't know that the original family was Spanish or that the ball was actually Yellow BEFORE watching the movie but NOW I DO!(after reading a couple dozen reviews here) And I Still Loved it! So many PC and petty people (giving 1-2 star reviews) that take a political stance about how no tsunami warnings were given to the poorer countries that suffered the most, or that a WHITE family instead of the dark-skinned Spanish were portrayed. Who cares! The movie ultimately was made for an American and English speaking audience and with it costing almost 50M to make, why not take some artistic license to make sure it is an ATTRACTIVE movie for most audiences! I get it. The movie, even with it's flaws, still works! Watts gives an amazing performance and how she hasn't won an Oscar yet is beyond me! She is astounding in her dramatic range. Ewon is good not great, and the older son Lucas also does a great job being a kid forced to grow up real fast. The movie focused mainly on this one family although a couple of other victims, a female in the bed next to Naomi and a man who lost his family at the beach and loans Ewon his cell phone are brief but good scenes. Yea, all white Euro-Americans but like I said, the movie is for middle-America so you have to dolly things up for the masses to fork over 15 dollars a ticket!I still give it 9 stars for the ultra-realistic tsunami scenes that look so real you think it's actual news footage but it is all original and Naomi Watts performance that despite it being a pretty simple story-line of tragedy and anguish, still rings with high emotion. The final scene of her looking out the window had me in tears.The nitpicking PC crowd can keep on bashing but it is a good movie about a devastating natural disaster.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Where are the brown people?,"Tom Holland as a child is not only adorable but is also an amazing actor. My only issue is that the movie focuses almost entirely on a group of extremely privileged white people and doesn't bother spending any time on the massive losses those who actually lived there incurred.It's not that the family the movie is about isn't important; it's not that rich white people don't matter. It's just that there was really no mention of anyone else. In fact, the real family wasn't even white, but we have white actors portraying them. In 2012, I think we knew better.

Impossibly Inept,"This drama looks at the impact of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami on a British family vacationing in Thailand. Although based on a true story, this is an unbelievably melodramatic film that feels contrived, with every plot point staged for maximum emotional impact. One of the problems is the singular focus on a tourist family. With all the devastation to the locals, it is hard to sympathize with the plight of an affluent white family. Poorly scripted and directed, it is shamefully manipulative, going for cheap emotions at every turn. Watts and McGregor are decent actors but can't overcome the material they have to work with here.

Brilliant depiction of a huge catastrophe--but the plot is linear and limited,"The Impossible (2012)I'll start by explaining the big basics: this is extremely well done, but it only does what the facts tell it to do.So, it's amazing. It shows the effects of the epic 2004 tsunami on a group of British tourists. It shows the unexpected before scenes (life is gorgeous, nothing will intrude) and it shows the flooding huge wash of ocean itself (the rush of destruction). In a way, that's enough for a great movie right there. Maybe the before stuff is generic—rich Europeans enjoying Thailand for its beauty and beachfront motel. Great.But the incoming waters and their pure terror are presented beautifully, incredibly. It's not just the spectacular crash of the wave on the upscale motel and palm trees, but the many minutes (it seems like hours) afterwards as our heroes get pushed inland with all the debris. It's quite astonishing, and for this alone I think the movie is worth the time—at the very least.There is another half of the movie that is about the core family trying to find all its members, one of whom is trying to simply stay alive in the makeshift hospital amidst all the other victims. This part of the movie is also well done, and very believable. Someone has taken the time to get the facts more or less correct. If you watch this you will be there. You'll understand at least what a rich foreigner might have experienced in the disaster.However (and you knew a however was coming, I hope): that's all there is. Yes, you might think it's enough. All the heartbreak and celebration all the struggle for meaning and life and family, keeping sanity and the basics of food and heartbeat, all of this seems like it's self-sufficient. But really, as a movie, as a development and investigation into character and meaning, I'm not seeing what it boils down to.For lovers of the movie this will seem petty, I'm sure. But really, as a piece, as a work of ""art"" or ""moviemaking"" or whatever we expect from a film, it does often seem like a simple portrayal of a disaster. It's not that we don't empathize—I was in the grip of the problem for the main two actors. It's more that it's really not quite enough for a cinematic project. It's almost like a docudrama, a re-enactment. Well done, but that's as far as it goes.To put it another way, if you like documentaries, and you have some feeling for the colossal tragedy of the earthquake and tsunami, you might like this purely and simply. If you want a movie-like development and some kind of moral and narrative complexity, this isn't quite up to snuff.Which leaves it in your hands. See it, for sure. But in perspective.",7.0,Anonymous,History

By far the best movie of 2012.,"The Impossible is the most gripping, heart shattering, intense piece of filmmaking I've seen in quite some time. The human tragedy, horror, fight for survival and unity is based on the harrowing true story of one of the worlds worst natural disasters of our time. 2004, Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami and one family's terrifying account. To me, this is the most powerful, heartfelt; disaster film based on real life events since probably Titanic, if not as grand.The performances were inspiring and heartbreaking. Naomi Watts gives one of her best and challenging roles to date; to me she deserves an Oscar for her performance. Another standout was Tom Holland and believe it or not this is his first major role, which to me is a bona fide movie star! Tom was the heart and soul of this movie and carried the film like a pro and deserves to be nominated, he was great! Ewan McGregor is always a strong performer and here is no exception, you feel all of his pain and powerful will to survive and find his family that swept away in a blink of an eye. I was also really impressed with the younger siblings in this film, played by newcomers Samuel Joslin and Oaklee Pendergast; you believed every emotion from them. Gripping ride!Director, Juan Antonio Bayona has created a triumph of a film, especially since this is his first major film, but you may also remember his other and also gripping foreign film, The Orphanage. The guy has mad talent and was bold and relentless in showing the horrors on that fateful day in December. Definitely a director to look out for. Oscar worthy all the way! The writing though, didn't match the effectiveness of everything else, but wasn't distracting from the film, it just could have been more memorable.Overall, forget about all of the other Oscar contenders, The Impossible is the real human soul of the awards season and an unforgettable watch.

LIVE IN SPITE OF... BELIEVE IN SPITE OF... ALWAYS,"The film ""Impossible"" is the best work of cinema in the genre of disaster films based on the great tragedy that occurred at the end of 2004. Stunningly filmed scenes of natural violence amaze and terrify at the same time, because you understand that all this happened in reality, with real people, not all of whom were able to escape (according to various estimates, as a result of the earthquake and natural disasters that occurred after it, from 225 thousand to 300 thousand people died)...It is also noteworthy that this is not an American blockbuster. Spain provides a good example of how you can make high-quality movies without resorting mainly to special effects (although they are present here, but only in order to convey to the viewer the scope of the disaster that happened many years ago). I want to emphasize the beautiful performance of the actors - you live these minutes, hours of despair with them, worry and sometimes do not hold back tears. Naomi Watts, who played the role of the mother of the family, by the way, was chosen for the filming of the heroine played by her (Maria Belen Alvarez). Naomi was her favorite actress, after Maria saw her in the movie ""21 grams"". But most of all admires of course Thomas Holland, the same 13-year-old Lucas, the eldest son of the family. But this is his first role, which should be noted - such a debut was appreciated by the American national Council of film critics, who awarded the young actor the award in the category ""Breakthrough of the year""! In the film, he resembled the angel himself, his courage resisting the ubiquitous fear and willing to help everyone who needs it so badly. Remember how he looked forward to his mother coming to her senses to tell her ""something very important""?! And this ""important"" was for him to share the news that he met the same boy in the hospital with the father who found him. The same boy they had saved in the darkest moments after the disaster. At the end of the tape, where Maria looks out the window of a flying plane, as if you catch the thoughts that fall with tears from her tired eyes ... Oh, how much gratitude they have to the Almighty, and also... in her eyes you can read the love for her family, and in particular, for her eldest son named Lucas. Thanks in many ways to his perseverance and zeal, the fate of not only his family, but also perhaps other people whom he managed to help, was formed in such a happy ending of this story!We should also mention the music in this film. She's amazing! Many melodies in different scenes were written by the famous Spanish composer Fernando Velazquez. I admit that some of these soundtracks are still relevant in my music playlist, and you can call me crazy, but as soon as I hear these incredibly sensual tunes, I sincerely want to go outside and hug the first person I meet...This film does not leave anyone indifferent, it fills the heart with warmth and faith in the brightest ideals of human relations. Very often, in the daily bustle, people do not see each other, remaining indifferent to human destinies. Sadly, it is in dramatic situations that one comes to understand the true nature of unity. It is impossible to convey this in words, but at least for the sake of this awareness, we can safely say that the film was not made in vain, despite some critics who ask questions like ""why profit from tragedies by shooting such pictures?"". Many years will pass, and I am sure that the interest in the film ""Impossible"" will continue to attract the attention of those who are alien to such concepts as indifference and disbelief. After all, is it not thanks to the opposition of these weaknesses, in an incredible way, contrary to all expectations, the family was together!",10.0,Anonymous,History

"Excellent performances, but protracted and predictable plot","The screenplay is based on a true story of the Spanish family Belón before and after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, and that is why it is a Spanish movie - apart from actors who are mostly from the USA. As its pace and running are very Spanish, hence the different running and longer focusing on reiterations and longer scenes. I am not very much into statics and several times I found myself in using (fast) forward function. Due to my imperfection, I guess... :) The cast is, however, brilliant, especially Naomi Watts as Maria Bennett and Tom Holland as Lucas Bennett; Ewan McGregor as Henry Bennett is great as well, but he spends less time on screen. On the other hand, because of the use of known actors, the viewers can shortly guess the outcome even if without prior knowledge of the story. It should be noted that all children's performances are very good and realistic, even the smaller Bennett boys have rather long bearing scenes.The movie is definitely for you if you like survival stories with ""ordinary"" people becoming real heroes.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Harrowing,"What happened in Thailand was truly a nightmare. One that I didn't really think about until I saw this film. The Impossible is a harrowing sometimes too intense emotional journey that although flawed has a truly powerful impact. Naomi Watts in a stellar performance and Ewan McGregor solid as well star as the parents of 3 young boys on vacation in Thailand when the Tsunami hits. The initial impact when the terror happens is daunting to say the least and handled with a suspenseful hand akin to Spielberg's in Jaws. The film that follows that scene is at times emotionally manipulative and frustrating in some spots but the overall effect is successful. What happened there was awful but the fact that this family survived is truly a miracle. Visually the film is gorgeous with tracking shots of the event, slow motion sequences that are breathtaking and lighting that really illuminates the emotions behind the events being depicted. It's a strong film from Director Bayona who made his mark with the brilliant horror film The Orphanage you can see shadings of the genre here with some questionable but intriguing directorial touches. All in all it's a great first film of the year and I really hope it sets a benchmark for the films to come. 4/5",9.0,Anonymous,History

The family is separated and lost in a strange country wishing and hoping they will find each other again. First off I will say that this is very emotional so be prepared for that. Also I know Naomi Watts was nominated for an Oscar for this but the kid that played Lucas should have been the one who was nominated. As far as the movie goes it was good, and I know it is a true story but it was really just too unbelievable for me to really get into. When the super emotional parts happened I was thinking, yeah right rather then tearing up. That is just me and maybe I am heartless but I couldn't get past the totally ""impossible"" aspects of the movie. All that said though this is a good movie and if you can handle it I would say watch it. Overall, a good true story that was just a little to unbelievable for me to get fully invested in. I give it a B.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Most painful movie of the year,"I cannot see this movie as ""entertainment"". It is a trip through hell and 15 kinds of human pain and suffering. How can I say that I got nothing from this movie except to say that I feel lucky to live where I do.I do not want to see this movie again. It is more than a horror movie. I had to shield my eyes many times just to decrease the painful input. There was only one small moment during the movie where someone was slightly smiling. This movie is 3 times more painful than ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""Zero Dark"" had torture in it.I now have more fearful respect for consequences of a Tsunami. Every painful thing that can happen to a person in such a disaster is presented in this movie. It overwhelmed me and I wanted to walk out. But I stayed. My day was slightly ruined by this movie. My mood was muted and somewhat dark all day afterward. If that is how you want to feel afterward, then you must see this movie.Perhaps it will someday become a Cult Film. As in: Wanna' know how it feels to be drowned, really? I am tired and beat just remembering it as I write this review. I do not want to see it again, ever.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Where were the Oscar nods for set and sound?,"there has been complaint from certain quarters that the film somehow does a disservice to the family by making them white Brits, rather than sticking to the reality that they are Spanish. There is also claim that, by focusing on this one fortunate family's survival, the movie arrogantly disregards the experiences of those indigenous to the country, and those whose experiences were not so fortunate. I find the prior accusation petty, and the latter ludicrous. In casting big names Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor in the lead roles, they simply ensure that the budget necessary for the production is more likely to be granted, and covered; the story of the family is still honoured well. The idea that somehow we ignore the plight of anybody else is just silly; certain moments in the movie, and in particular the beautifully conceived final scene, touch very well on the fact that many were not so lucky. The title of the film itself ties in with Bayona's intent to illustrate just how rare the sort of good fortune it depicts was, and the family are shown to clearly understand this. I am flabbergasted people are reading it any other way, to be honest.The first ten minutes of this movie are filled with a tension; the fact we know what comes next makes the setup of Maria and Henry's great relationship with their boys, Lucas, Thomas and Simon somehow more distressing. The next forty minutes are truly a technical miracle; never before have I been in a cinema feeling quite so overwhelmed by the depiction of a natural disaster. Bayona uses incredible miniature sets, real water, terrifying use of sound, and superb in-camera make-up to stunning effect, forcing us to endure the entire tsunami as mother and son do. We follow Maria and Lucas' events for about an hour before cutting over to Henry, Thomas and Simon. I will say that there is, for me, something lacking in the second act of the film, but this is possibly because the first has blown you away to such an extent, the devastated quietness of what follows feels naturally muted.This said, the performances carry through very well; McGregor is heartbreaking, and particular note has to be given to all the boys, who we adore pretty much on the spot. I would also suggest keeping an eye open for Tom Holland, who plays Lucas; his arc and the maturity of his performance feels so wonderfully natural, it is a struggle to believe his only experience has been as Billy Elliott on stage, and voicing a character in 2010's Arrietty. Naomi Watts has been nominated for a Best Actress Oscar, and whilst I suspect she will not win, I can say I have not seen her giving such a physical and emotionally draining performance, and that if you only see her in this and Eastern Promises, you might be forgiven for believing she is English.This film does drain you; by the time you leave the movie, you do feel a little washed out, and thankful that in the end this is a story of human triumph over adversity and a celebration of spirit, rather than the dour tale it could have threatened to be. Despite a second act lacking the kinetic force of the first, and the fact that Watts and Holland are really the more compelling characters and performances, and despite some moments where the gorgeous score does seem to teeter on being too much, overall this is a recommended experience. I have no idea why it is not nominated for production design and sound editing, because it should wipe the floor in those categories.",7.0,Anonymous,History

really boring,"I don't know how they did it, but the makers of this movie made the 2004 Tsunami seem really boring. In fact, only about five minutes of the film is dedicated to the Tsunami itself. There is no footage of the awesome pullback of the ocean before the wave hits and very little of the wave hitting. Instead, we watch a family who gets separated and then spends the rest of the movie looking for each other. The disaster appears as little more than a catalyst for this family's traumatic separation. It's more like a Lifetime movie than a film about an epic disaster. I was truly disappointed. If you want to see powerful images of the 2004 Tsunami, I suggest ""Tsunami: Caught on Camera,"" a documentary made up only of eye-witness footage. The documentary is powerful and eerie, while this film is understated and prosaic. This movie is just dull. I am baffled by its high ratings on IMDb. I wonder if people are rating this movie's overwhelming subject matter and not its underwhelming treatment of it.",2.0,Anonymous,History

"""Take Care of My Babies""","Few films manage to capture a story of devastation without stumbling into clichéd, sappy moments, but The Impossible—the newest film by director Juan Antonio Bayona (The Orphanage)—holds its head above water to deliver a visually beautiful and emotionally captivating feature.The Impossible recounts the true story of a Spanish (British in the film) family caught amidst the colossal devastation of the 2004 tsunami that ravaged Thailand. Maria (Naomi Watts) and Henry (Ewan McGregor) Bennett are enjoying a holiday at a picturesque beach resort with their three young boys: Lucas (Tom Holland), Thomas (Samuel Joslin), and Simon (Oaklee Pendergast). The family's vacation is interrupted by a massive wave that separates the family, and causes massive destruction throughout the mainland.The film's main focus is Maria—embodied perfectly by Naomi Watts—and the struggle she must bear with her eldest son, Lucas. When the family is torn apart, Maria and Lucas must travel through the wreckage, seeking shelter. While the entire cast provide brilliant performances (McGregor never ceases to amaze.), it is Watts and Holland who display the pinnacle of emotional fortitude. Sergio G. Sánchez, who penned the screenplay, demonstrated his ability to craft an engaging relationship dynamic between a mother and her child in Bayona's previous film, The Orphanage, and the emotional dependence he creates between Maria and Lucas is astounding.The film is a spectacle of chaos. When the tsunami strikes the beach, the magnitude of the impact is personalized through Naomi Watts' point of view. After she is delivered from the ocean's turmoil, Bayona pulls back, revealing the shear scale of the devastation. All that is visible lies in utter ruin. The scope of this event is frightening, and Bayona does not shy away from his material. The 2004 tsunami was one of the deadliest natural disasters in history, and this is respectfully envisioned by Bayona. Though the storyline concentrates chiefly on the Bennetts, the audience retains a sense of the desolation visited upon this community.The Impossible is a shocking film. Bayona manages to capture some riveting images, thrusting the audience directly into the horror of a natural disaster. Through this particular family, Bayona displays the necessity of human solidarity, the power of physical and emotional pain, and the joy of deliverance. This is the first movie I watched this year where I was unable to take notes while viewing it; my attention was consistently on the screen. The film is severe in its presentation of devastation, but enthralling in its display of human resilience.Here are my other reviews: http://flickermotion.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,History
Nothing is more powerful than the human spirit.,"Just a few weeks ago, I complained about how emotionally manipulative ""Les Misérables"" (2012) was. Yes, every film is manipulative in a way to elicit a certain reaction from the audience, whether it is to be scared during a horror film or laughter during a comedy. If a film is constructed badly, you see the tricks the filmmakers use on and off camera, making everything feel fake and contrived, which is the case with something like ""Les Misérables."" However, if done well, you get something magnificent like ""The Impossible.""Yeah, I cried. I felt empathy for the characters because they felt like genuine people. I felt like I was there with them through their tremendous struggle. As it is the case with sappy films like this, I'm sure some people won't buy into the film's melodrama. But I did. The film is incredibly well made and directed and the actors simply wonderful that everything felt true and genuine, not fake and manipulative. And that's the difference. ""The Impossible"" proves that Juan Antonio Bayona is a director to look out for. Additionally, hats off to Tom Holland. He's terrific in the film.",9.0,Anonymous,History
The Impossible,"Naomi Watts just seized her second Oscar nomination (ended with an inevitable lose though) in this tsunami catastrophe survival drama which happened in South Asia 2004. Directed by Spanish young director Juan Antonio Bayona (yes, it is a Spanish production in spite of its mainly English-speaking cast), which marks his comeback after the internationally-accoladed debut THE ORPHANAGE (2007, 8/10), an ingeniously orchestrated horror-fest.The film's first half is a lip-smacking triumph not only for the special visual effects simulating the walls of water and its overwhelming impact, it's like HEREAFTER (2010, 6/10) meets 127 HOURS (2010, 8/10), vividly renders a kindness of faithful vicariousness on viewers through the white-knuckle self-salvage from the mother-son dyad. And if HEREAFTER could nab an Oscar nomination for BEST VISUAL EFFECTS, THE IMPOSSIBLE easily trumps it. But for the second half, the storytelling adopts a middle-of-the-road sentimentality, it is all about the reunion, still, there is a remarkable achievement for the editing team (and the cinematography group as well) to interlace Watts' flashbacks under the water with the operation she is undergoing, which is done with an eye-opening flourish.Adapted from a true event, from one hand, it affirmatively obviates the barbs like what's the odds the entire family (one couple with 3 son, age 12, 7 and 5 respectively) could pull through the calamity, it is a genuine miracle literally had happened (as far as the denouement concerned), so just deal with it! But from the other hand, the film shamefully sacrifices the accuracy for the sake of the emotional climax, which is a prerequisite for selling the tickets I suppose, and it worked (my eyes swelled with tears for many occasions), even simultaneously there is a tint of bathos ascending when the five of them finally find each other altogether at one place one time, it is so lame!Anyway, the film is also a victory for the cast, although Watts is bedridden for half of her time on screen, her hard-earned Oscar nomination is well-deserved, an impeccable endeavor out of the mundanity of her character (a woman try to survive under a dire circumstance). Tom Holland, the true leading man and great discovery from the film as the eldest son, has a stunning resemblance of a young Jamie Bell (what a coincidence, Tom was actually had a stint in BILLY ELLIOTS the musical to play the titular role in 2008, and call it sexism, academy never nominates teenage actors for their leading roles), most of the time he is the audience's proxy, we see through his eyes, his precocity and gallantry dominates the most chunk of the film's narrative and it has been executed unimpeachably. Ewan McGregor, absent for a disturbingly long time in the film, can only descend himself in a supporting part, he is a consistent great player in the race who is unfortunately always falling under the Oscar radar by only a notch, his cellphone-calling scene should be inscribed in every Oscar voter's mind, so next time, his glory will be duly justified. Also, the great Geraldine Chaplin, delivers the punchline ""the impossibility of death stars"" in her unforgettable cameo.Juan Antonio Bayona has warranted his craftsmanship in dealing with spectacular sensations, so Hollywood might beckon him to their wonderland, even if not, I daresay the next big thing is on the rising.ps, I guess Seth MacFarlane did see this film since apart from MULHOLLAND DR. (2001, 9/10) we also saw your boobs here, Naomi, but this time we are in a rueful mood.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"An Unforgettable, Draining but Uplifting Cinematic Experience!","It's an unforgettable, draining but uplifting cinematic experience. Juan Antonio Bayona makes a sensational debut into English movies, after his gripping Spanish horror masterpiece 'El Orfanato'. This time, he creates horror of a different variety. He terrifically recreates the mayhem of the environmental catastrophe named Tsunami, through the eyes of one family. If people are expecting to see the complete devastation and tragedy surrounding the disaster, they'll be disappointed. As the movie's tagline says, 'This is one family's true story of survival'.The haunting background score, the remarkable camera-work and the spectacular special effects almost throws us into the middle of all the chaos. But, it is the stunning acting that carries the movie forward, and helps us understand the gravity of the situation. Naomi Watts and the young star, Tom Holland, are the stars of the movie. Watts gives one of the finest performances of her career. But Holland, being so young, shows such maturity with his stunning range of emotions. Their characters, and their amazing relationship, are quite poignantly portrayed. The characters could have been developed and explored a little more, before the Tsunami hit, so that their story could have been more effective. But other than that, I've got no complains.The climactic reunion scene outside the hospital is a well-acted and amazingly shot scene; it was undeniably moving.It's a heroic tale of endurance, hope and survival. Pray that this movie is the closest you, or anyone close to you, get(s) to a disaster.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Expertly crafted, phenomenally acted","Not a lot of story here: tsunami hits, family is divided, members are hurt but try to find each other in the utter chaos. Still it's able to put you right there in the horror with two easy to empathize leads and a handful of bafflingly wonderful child actors.You expect this kind of extra-impressive acting from the two old pros, Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor, but these new kids, especially Tom Holland plying their son Lucas, are at least as effective. Never caught the slightest false move on any of them. Now how is that possible? They've certainly never had to live through anything quite as horrific and yet you would swear they have.Somehow the tsunami itself looks real as does the landscape in its aftermath. We've just spent some time on a beach on vacation and this movie brought it all back. Even the family's dirty and disheveled state looked right in every way.Quibbles might include some unnecessary near misses as they searched for each other and what might have been an overblown rendition of one lead's physical state, but I could just as easily believe this was the way they remembered or lived it.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Impressive recreation, but limp characterisation","An American husband (Ewan McGregor) and wife (Naomi Watts) and their three children, looking for some R&R in a beach resort in Thailand, are in the wrong place at the time, as a tsunami literally hits them. After this opening sequence, which at times relies too much on obvious CGI- effects, the story trails Maria (Watts), who is badly injured, and her eldest son Lucas (Tom Holland), who together try to find a safe haven and any trace of their family. Although Watts and Holland acquit themselves pretty well, Holland's character is marred by dialogue which suggests this child has the wisdom of someone who's seen it all. It takes away a lot of the credibility of this story, as do a couple of coincidental, melodramatic twists, which may or may not be true, but if truth is stranger than fiction, go for fiction! It would also been easier to care for this family, if they hadn't been a bunch of rich, spoilt Americans. McGregor is not given a lot to do, but Joslin and Pendergast are perfectly cast as the little brothers, and there's a wonderful, authoritative cameo by Geraldine Chaplin, in one of the most poetic scenes in the film. All in all a mixed bag, which depends on your willingness to buy into the characters.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Honestly and truthfully - it's shockingly awful,"This is my very first review on IMDb. Without doubt this site is the most reliable source for honest film reviews and in my opinion anything rated 7 or above is well worth watching. Until now that is. This film, currently rated a whopping 7.7 is in fact unbelievably bad. Like you would not believe. And right from the off. Wooden acting from McGregor and Watts is simply terrible, throughout. Either I must be missing something, give the startling reviews, or, more likely the reviews are based on sentiment given the tragic loss of life from recent tsunamis. The story line is also highly implausible. How is it that first class actors and a director with at least one excellent film to his name (Orphanage) can be happy with this production? Given the basis of the story it can't not be nominated for any awards. But it ain't gonna win any, and thats for sure.",1.0,Anonymous,History

A Family Swept Away and Apart,"Naomi Watts, an actress who I adore, is responsible for getting my butt in the seat for this fictionalized drama about a vacationing family who get swept away by the Asian tsunami of 2004.The real family upon which this film is based was not British, as they are in this film, but rather Spanish, Mexican or Portugese, I forget which. The movie has as a result taken on criticism for its ""anglicanization"" of a tragedy that affected more Asians than anyone else, but here becomes something that befalls privileged Western Europeans on holiday. No matter -- I think the filmmakers' hearts were in the right place, and that the family in the film are representative of everyone who was affected. After all, as characters, they're flat as cardboard cutouts, so it's easy for them to be stand-ins for anyone.The film isn't nearly as grueling and gripping as I thought it would be. We don't know these people at all, and the movie takes very little time to introduce them to us, so that when bad things do happen to them, I felt the abstract sympathy I would feel for anyone in the same situation, but no real investment in their story or its outcome. The kids aren't very good actors, so it's hard to really believe the emotions they're asked to convey. Watts gives a physically brutal performance, but isn't asked to develop much of a character, and spends most of the film's running time lying prone on a hospital bed. Ewan McGregor plays the dad, and his character makes so many bone-headed decisions that only through sheer luck don't make a bad situation even worse, that I spent more time being annoyed with him than I did caring about his plight.The visual effects are fairly impressive, and feel much more like the old school effects of yesteryear than the anonymous CGI effects of today.Grade: B",6.0,Anonymous,History

"The Impossible isn't quite mission accomplished, but is probably on the better side of most likely genre contenders.","A Hall Of Fame/ Walk Of Shame ReviewWith the sun set on the horizon of 2012, the flood gates open for 2013's rather hefty load of comic book sequels and horror reboots, with some looking promising and others nauseating. But leading the charge of the new year is The Impossible, a families true story of survival during 2004's devastating Tsunami (with only the ethnicity of the family being altered from Spanish to British as some sort of insensitive marketing technique).The cast is fronted by Naomi Watts and Ewan McGreggor, who awkwardly deliver underwhelming dialogue in the scenes leading up to the pivotal catastrophe. The sense of unity and family is never entirely established because the on-screen chemistry seems forced and slightly 'robo-tronic', with the child actors actually upstaging their piers, as their playful innocence seems more organic than their parents' stiff interaction. This could perhaps be director Juan Antonio Bayon inability to direct actors in none distressing scenes, as both lead performances and new comer Tom Holland performances start sloppy but thankfully pick up as the film goes on and the situation get more intense with no favours from the wishy-washy screenplay.However, if conversation isn't Bayon's forte, then visual direction most certainly is with The Impossible being filled to the brim with astounding shots of total destruction, with the tidal wave act definitely surpassing Eastwood's efforts in Hereafter (hmm, you don't remember it either?) The cinematography and set design is an achievement in it's self, remaining slightly unnerving how Bayonmanages to keep such malfunction under such control. The make-up on the injuries is unsettlingly profound, really pushing the boundaries of blood and injury in a PG-13 film. The wide shots of the panic in the hospitals and wards needs to be applauded, however Bayon does manage to drop the ball when it comes to commemorating the lives lost of the countries natives and portrays a almost 'I Am Legend' like aura in a disaster claiming 30,000 lives. This refrains the film from much needed authenticity, but it's enough to keep you somewhat engaged in the survival and discovery of the other family members.Disaster movies do suffer from taking lulls after the main attraction hits in its second half (in this case, with waves from the Indian oceans tearing up the scenery) but to it's credit, The Impossible quite comfortably pulls off interest in it's 114 minute running time, with an execution that isn't too sweet, but savage either, but just right. It's moving without being upright tear jerking, which is surprising considering it's subject matter, probably due to cliché secondary characters weighing down the realism when it comes to panic and social interaction.So, to concludeMore of an achievement than a mission accomplished, The Impossible succeeds in it's visuals, but isn't quite the triumph when it comes to it's human side. Moving with out leaving you distraught, positive without leaving you inspired. Will offend by the thousands, but is probably on the better side of most likely genre contenders.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Moments,"The writers face some problems. First problem is that nobody cares what happens, in any scene, prior to the tidal wave. The only possible way around this problem is to write scenes prior to the tidal wave that people will care about. But instead of doing this the writers actually have the actors act out the entire process of arriving at a resort. Scene by scene. You know that process, yes? Flying on a plane. Traveling to a resort. Checking in to the resort. Not getting the room you booked. Realizing you are in fact paying to live in a kindergarten full of other peoples children running wild in a pool. For a week or more. By this time any sane person, character or viewer, would welcome a tidal wave. And then, mercifully for all, it arrives. The special effects are good. The writing then goes down hill. We are invited to empathize with the notion, real or imagined, that rich white women get their own private hospital room, complete with consultant physician, in a third world disaster zone. In case the audience is insufficiently empathising inside the hospital the score insets straining violin and also slow piano. We then pick up the story of the husband. The unfortunate thing about Ewan McGregor, who no doubt is a lovely guy, is that one inevitably ends up contemplating the timeless conundrum of why his career peaked with Train Spotting. And so one is no longer immersed in the movie. It is a line of thought impossible to break so long as he is in camera. This is the problem with casting him in this role or any role. Why not give a new actor a go. The movie already has Watts as the draw card. But why him. There can be no justification. It has been said that western literature consists of the extraction of hidden knowledge from its characters followed by the creation or reunification of the nuclear family. This film elevates these to the level of farce. Every scene is a pregnant pause before vital information is whispered when it should be urgently shouted. There is genuine convincing horror in this film. The thought of even stubbing your toe badly enough to require help in a third world country is enough to highlight the inconvenience of experiencing Armageddon there. And I like Watts in everything she does. If there is another Alien movie she would be a good choice as the hero.",,Anonymous,History
OKish disaster movie,"OKish disaster movie. Better than Hereafter, which dealt with the same event (but then took on deeper subjects and lost its way), but that does not say much.Interesting in that it shows how people survive the disaster and deal with it. Special effects are particularly good, especially those of the tsunami and of the people in it.However, is quite padded, especially towards the end. The director just seemed intent on drawing the movie out and it ends up a few scenes too long. And these scenes are overly long...Performances by Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor are fine, though Watts' performance should not have gotten her an Oscar nomination - it wasn't THAT good. The kids' performances are mostly irritating.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Sadness and happiness,"WOW!
What a movie and an incredible story.
I have no words.
Naomi Watts played her role perfectly. I did not know that Lucas was Tom Holland. Tom being so young, played his role amazingly. I don't know how old he was in this movie, but incredible for such a young actor, to play a role like this.
You get all kinds of emotions seeing this movie.
I had no idea about the Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, that happened in 2004. Now seeing this movie, I have read more about this.
There were a lot of scenes where it seemed so real that we the audience could feel all those scary emotions.
A amazing movie.

Great film,"The Impossible is a film that focuses on a families experience of the South East Asia Tsunami in 2004. This is a true story and when the film starts with an insight into the family on Christmas day everybody knows what is about to happen.Although the Tsunami sequence plays an important part of the film, the majority of the film focuses on the aftermath. The arrival of the Tsunami was nicely done and there's no doubt that the sudden arrival of it will have been that many people experienced it. Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts play the lead roles and it was great to see McGregor put in a good performance. The film is best when it focuses on the kindness of people towards each other.

Don't Take it Lightly,"There's many natural disaster movies out there, some of which are based on real events as this one was, but not many evoke this much realism.Though I can't at all say how real this movie is to the survivors, but this seemed incredibly realistic to someone who hasn't experienced anything of this nature. The destruction, chaos, and fear captured throughout actually made it difficult to watch. It's been a long time since I've watched something where I felt this disturbed. Not to say that's a bad thing, just at how real it felt and to know it was based on a real family.A lot of credit has to be given to the actors who were able to portray so much feeling into these roles. As a viewer, a wave of emotions would be an apt description.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Falls short of capturing the impact of the 'real' footage.,"""The Impossible"" is a solid, well-made disaster film, based on a true story, fueled by the human spirit fighting for survival with fine performances, especially by Naomi Watts. The tsunami sets up the story line for the rest of the film--a catastrophic situation that allows the audience a sense of the aftermath of such an overwhelming natural disaster. However, ""The Impossible"" soon becomes a painful experience to endure; and not for the reasons one might expect either. ""The Impossible"" feels every bit as average, never rising above its own genre conventions--but it compensates with fine performances and outstanding realistic effects.Maria (Naomi Watts) and Henry (Ewan McGregor) decide to spend Christmas with their three children in Thailand, hoping to enjoy a festive season complete with sunshine and exotic beaches. However and without warning, a massive Tsunami crashes into the coastline, separating the family, leaving them to face one of the most devastating natural disasters of modern times. The first half of the movie unfolds as a survivalist picture, pitting the characters against horrific and devastating conditions--creating gripping suspense through the process. There are inspirational moments of perseverance, families reuniting, people pulling together, and overcoming obstacles. The film's most dramatic sequences focus on Lucas (Todd Holland), assigning himself the role of his mother's lifeguard and protector.However, as the film continues into the second act, it becomes slightly disjointed with a sense of seamless wandering as it stumbles toward its denouement. As the husband, separated from his wife and searching for her, McGregor finds himself walking aimlessly and completely hopeless. He does a lot of tripping and falling through floors and screaming. Through McGregor's role, he encounters others adrift and injured searching for family members, and this introduction to a broader story makes this families' story seem a bit more trivial. What Juan Antonio Bayona is trying to do with ""The Impossible"" is honorable and well done, but does absolutely nothing with an endless number of possibilities. Simply put, it just gets boring after a while. The tsunami that slams into their resort happens in the first 15 minutes of the movie, and it is the most exciting part of the entire film. Their characters exist to serve as a component guiding the narrative that takes us on a ""tour"" of the aftermath caused by the tsunami. Not to take anything away from Naomi Watts outstanding performance.When watching the actual footage and material online and listening to the real victims and their gut-wrenching stories, it leaves one stunned in disbelief. In comparison, the movie falls short of capturing that genuine, raw emotion of astonishment and incredulity.",6.0,Anonymous,History

"Impossible, Emotional","Visually stunning, highly emotional, and an engrossing plot, The Impossible follows the incredible story of one family struck by the 2004 Thailand tsunami. It is difficult to watch at times, as it truly represents the devastation that can be caused by such a disaster, and the aftermath on screen was horrendous. Well acted by all, including the children, and a brilliant debut from a young Tom Holland.The title is very appropriate, as the ending feels like pure Hollywood coincidental make-believe. But, apparently it's accurate, so I suppose in many ways the filmmakers struck gold for an emotional climax, it does bring everything together to formulate a conclusion for an utterly unbelievable story.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Ewan you are smarter than this,"Have I seen this movie? No...so what right do I have to give an opinion? On first inspection none but as someone who has always respected Ewan McGregor and his role in the Scottish community I feel he has been at the least naive in his participation in this movie as it focuses on tourists and not the community that did not have the option to fly home at the end of the disaster.When a group of ""privileged"" people get together and brainstorm a movie centred around a disaster they may have a blind spot as to those who were really the victims. I am sorry Ewan fell into the trap and hope that all learn from the mistake that is the premise to this film",,Anonymous,History
Meh,"Okay okay. I know it's based on the tragic events of the tsunami, but I just had some issues with the film and plot.Pros: Tom Holland was fantastic in this, I typically don't like child actors in films, but I thought he nailed this role. No wonder he got picked up for Spider-Man! Acting from Naomi Watts was also great!
The first 15 minutes was fantastic, shot really well and it really illustrated the moments it all happened. Also enjoyed how it focused on one families story rather than adding loads of characters.Cons: Annoying cliches are a constant, turning around slowly etc but the one that bugged me the most was when they were all looking for each other and would keep missing them by second. Look, we know they are going to all meet up at the end stop teasing it's just really really annoying.
Didn't really see the point in the final 25 mins of the film, I won't go into detail but what you expect to happen, happens but then you have a further 25 mins of film to continue. Felt forced.
I read in a lot of reviews that people were angry with the portrayal of this rich white family who sodded off in the end on a private jet and I get where they are coming from.

Good film but not totally amazing.,"A good moderately dramatic story, which you can tell is roughly true to life. There is not enough back story and character buildup so we do not get the emotional investment needed to engage with the people in the film all the way to the end. The events carry a lot of emotional charge but for me - just not enough.According to many of other users comments the main concerns are the family in the original true life story are Spanish => Non Northern European => basically Black Africans, replaced with tall blond perfect Aryan Specimens with a rosy English tint to them, and the second big racism charge is that native Indonesian's are used as mat's for white people to cross to safety which they gladly and willingly do.OK, I can see why there is a feeling of ignoring the horrors the Thai's went through, we should have seen more native victims - but in a tourist resort, not the mainland, it probably was like this - and the natives are portrayed mono dimensionally like saints, but because this is just a story from one families perspective, there can be no Native narrative! As for the bunch of Blonde dopplegangers - One of the real life characters in the movie is now in the UK learning how to be a lifeguard. And I wouldn't know to look at him or any of the family if hes is Welsh, English or Spanish just as with any other European! The only racist here is the attempt by people to make hair colour racist.

Young Tom Holland Carries This Film!,"""The Impossible"" was about the disastrous 2004 tsunami in Thailand. It was heart-pounding to see the devastating wave rise up so unexpectedly and heart-wrenching to see it completely destroy an entire unsuspecting town. The director did not spare us from the gory things that happen under the rampaging waters, where the humans (particularly, Naomi Watts) get seriously wounded with the various debris that hit them underwater.We follow a family of five who miraculously survives the disaster. At first we only see the mom Maria (Naomi Watts), then her eldest son Lucas (Tom Holland). As Maria was taken to the hospital to treat her serious leg injury and Lucas looks after her, we see that her husband Henry and two younger sons also survive with minor injuries. Following a suspenseful series of near misses in the hospital, the family, and the audience, were rewarded with a gloriously touching, inevitably tear-jerking reunion scene.I do not really understand why Naomi Watts is getting the lions' share of the awards buzz, even getting an Oscar nomination for Best Actress. In fact, young Tom Holland deserves it more with numerous difficult scenes he had to do when Naomi was already rendered bedridden by her severe injuries. Ewan McGregor was no slouch as well, but he had limited screen time compared to Naomi and Tom.I thought that this film was too long, despite the fact that the tidal wave already struck within the first 10 minutes of the running time. We do not really know the central family that well. There were several scenes that seemed repetitive and just added on to prolong the basic story, or to heighten drama, like Naomi's slow-motion surfacing from the water scene. Apart from a few winning scenes, as a whole the film is, unfortunately, also water-logged.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Cloyed flow,"A question loomed in mind while seeing this. We follow the true story that allows us to tangle with loss and destruction, letting the sombre realization of human frailty in the face of cosmic waves overwhelm us, so that in the end we'll be cleansed by the miraculous power of life to sometimes set up the most impossible redemption.It happens. It affirms the purpose of not losing sight of loved ones, of looking and nurturing their presence over an unknowable distance. It does let us experience briefly the loss and sorrow of those whose stories weren't so fortunate. And it appears, with respect for those who truly lost that day, in a light that extends this purpose of anticipated reunion in a larger sense.Yet the rarity of this story, the fact that it ends with this family safe and whole, keeps it from feeling intellectually satisfying, it's just not the feeling so many must have boarded their last flights home with. So the point for me, the real challenge in making a film like this, would be a film that keeps the same vital realizations above but folds them in a more encompassing manner.The realizations are powerful and visual: anticipation of presence, uncertainty, fundamental ambiguity as survivors hope and search but it may well be in vain, presence in a larger sense as still carrying the vision of loved ones among ruins of life, a life now understood to have been a thin, a superficial veneer the ocean rolled up; it doesn't matter that they could go to a fancy hotel resort but that they were together.A fundamental answer for me lies in the visual logic that connects scenes. Here this logic is linear; find, lose and find again, building to the final salvation, an emotional moment but it fizzles quickly because we realize there's so much that's been left behind in the wreckage.So how would it be for these to be ambiguously shuffled? Malick would know just how. He has similarly immense backdrops, war, history, creation, but they are re-arranged by the power of internal recollection. Start not necessarily with what happens first but what color you want for the urge. I know I would put near the end the image of everyone together on the beach the night before sending out paper lanterns into the sky. How would you choose to remember?",,Anonymous,History
The Quake,"Just watched the movie, it's amazing, because I experienced the tsunami myself. But I wonder why there was no quake before the wave in the movie. Because, I think the quake is the most important thing in this movie. I was a little bit disappointed. But, I seriously felt the movie, and reminded me of the exact time of tsunami. The visual effect was awesome, it was so real, The place was torn apart like the way it was hit. I saw with my own eyes. The acting was really great, Naomi was so good in the movie. Ewan did a really great Job. But the one who deserve an appreciation would be Tom, this kid is so amazing, he would be a great actor.

An Emotional Drama,"The 2004 Tsunami was one of the biggest and most destructive natural disasters in recent memory, creating damage from India to Indonesia and causing at least 230,000 deaths. One of the worst affected countries was Thailand and thus was born The Impossible, a film from the creative team behind the horror film The Orphanage, director J.A. Bayona and writer Sergio G. Sánchez set out to show both a personal story as well as tell a wider tale about the Tsunami affecting that area.Henry and Maria Bennett (Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts) and their children Lucas, Tomas and Simon (Tom Holland, Samuel Joslin and Oaklee Pendergast) are a British family who go to Thailand for a Christmas vacation. But they are separated when the Tsunami hits, with Naomi and Lucas caught in the wave and ending up seeing the chaos and the confusion that the disaster caused. As Lucas battles in a hospital to get his mother the medical attention she needs, Henry sets out to find Maria and Lucas, something that seems to be a hopeless cause.One of the best features of The Impossible is Bayona's great ability to show both the scale of the disaster and impact it has on the landscape and people whilst still showing a personal story. Bayona recreates this with his wide shots and helicopter shots, that recreate the massive devastation the wave caused to both to manmade structures and the natural landscape, showing the large death toll and he is able to immerse you into the chaos of the aftermath of the tight hospital area with vivid detail. For a film with a PG-13 rating, it is surprisingly gory and Bayona does not put his punches when showing the extent of Maria's injuries. Bayona also gives us an instance sequence when the Tsunami waves hit as Maria and Lucas struggle to reach each with all the dirt and debris in the water. It is feat of special effects, drama and action. Bayona knew the impact of the Tsunami and brought out the harrowing nature of the disaster in its fullest.McGregor, Watts and Holland all give very emotional performance and the trio are excellent bring out their characters in the themes of parenthood and the child-parent relationship and bond. Despite the subject manner of The Impossible the actors and the director bring out the theme of hope and how they either must keep it or how they can provide it to others.The Impossible is a weepy of a film and it wants to brings its audience on an emotional roller-coaster, but it can be a bit manipulative at times. Bayona does this a number of times with children being put in peril and families being reunited in slow motion and sentimental music to match. This is an obvious attempt to tug at the audiences heart strings; but it is at times over done and over played as it tries to elicit as much emotion as it can muster.The Impossible is a very actuate film that excels that showing both a personal story and the wider situation of the disaster. It is more then a simple weepy because of its themes and how it shows impact of the Tsunami. The Impossible is an excellently acted film and Bayona's direction is high hitting, even if it's occasionally a little too heavy handed.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com",8.0,Anonymous,History
Accurate depiction of disaster experience,"Tom Holland's performance carried the film for me. I didn't love the script in some of its details, and I thought the reunion moments and some of the emotionality after that was maudlin rather than moving.In certain other ways I was impressed. I've read a good deal on the psychology of disaster and experienced one major one myself, and the film does a good job of showing how chaotic things can be and how poor human decisions can be at such times. (Sending your tiny kids off with strangers in a foreign country while you set yourself a task that will get accomplished somehow later on even if you keep your kids? A really stupid thing to do, and a really normal human response in a disaster.) The shutting off of sound at times they are tossed around in the water early on is also something that happens (sometimes people go temporarily blind, too.) While surely some film viewers will say ""I would do better than this,"" they're mostly wrong--some people are great in disasters, but if you are or not is to a great extent hard-wiring, if you have certain brain structures or not, and not under your willful control. Training can help maximize performance, too, but who could train for this? Absent tsunami warning sirens, you're at the mercy of luck and how well your brain automatically works. Lucas--the character and perhaps the boy in real life--has the optimum response, while the adults here are nearer average. Did the filmmakers trust the reports of the survivors or read extensively to get this information? However they came to it, I appreciated seeing a truthful depiction.Still, the film seemed pretty average to me overall. I'd never watch it a second time, but I don't resent the 90 minutes I spent with it.",6.0,Anonymous,History

The Impossible .... a nice film on Thai Tsunami......,"""The Impossible"" manifests the disasters led by the 2004 Tsunami that hit Thailand in December. The film chronicles the story of a couple with their three sons who come to a Thai beach during the Christmas vacation and face one of the greatest catastrophes and get separated from the Tsunami. Perhaps one of the major films on Tsunami after 8 years of its occurrence, it tries to revoke a theme on disaster and succeeds to a par excellence in terms of narration, acting, and photography. At times the film has a feel of a docudrama and at times even becomes digressive but on a whole, the film is rich in emotions and melodrama and succeeds in bringing the harrowing experiences led by a natural catastrophe.

"NOT a disaster movie, but a bland hollywood formula movie with lots of violins and sentimental scenes.","NOT a disaster movie at all, which is kinda odd, because this tsunami was one of the biggest natural disasters in history. Yes, we can see the disastrous tsunami flood at the beginning of the movie, depicted with impressive true to life special effects, but after 5 minutes of rampage the flood is miraculously calmed down. That's nothing even near what happened in real life. Well, let's forget about that flaw for a minute and let's focus on the story as it is presented.The fact that this movie is totally fixated on 1 family is rather narrowminded. Tens of thousands of other people have died, but we dont get to see them much. This tsunami disaster was only used as a plot for a sentimental tearjerker movie, in which 2 parents and their 3 children are constantly moaning and crying in a hospital. All being depicted in such a sentimental (violins!) way, that it soon becomes rather tedious to watch.Just a bland hollywood movie that has used the biggest natural disaster to milk out a sentimental script.

great movie,"I disagree with some of the comments about this being a corny movie.I was living in thailand at the time on the eastern seaboard{pattaya}.And was actually supposed to be in koh samuii on xmas eve with my 2 kids and wife the kids were 4 years and the youngest 7 months,we had to cancel because i was really sick.I did not here about the tsunami until the 27th.If the tsunami had hit the eastern sea board my bar was 100 yards from the beach so i was double lucky.I met people who had been in the disaster as well as people who went to help and they were in tears when they related there stories.Some of these people where quite far inland when it hit and they where still hit very hard,so you can only imagine what it was like for the people near the sea. So i think this movie tells that story as for the insurance guy who gets the family out,i think there was an irony about people around them who were going nowhere,and i think this was deliberate by the director.We will never know what people went through that day but this was a story based on a true family,and for them all to be reunited was impossible,in fact it was a miracle.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Nothing Is More Powerful Than The Human Spirit,"From the director of Spanish chiller The Orphanage, The Impossible arrives as a disaster film based on the true account of a close-knit family. However, no matter how spellbinding some of its key sequences look or how strong the performances are, the film unfortunately falls short of making its desired impact & is marred by its incredibly manipulative premise.The Impossible tells the story of a close-knit family vacationing in Thailand during December 2004 but their Christmas celebration is cut short when the entire South-East Asia is stuck by a devastating tsunami the very next morning, altering the life & fate of thousands. The story covers the plight of this particular family & their fight for survival against all odds.Directed by J.A. Bayona, the direction is pretty good but the script is just full of emotionally manipulative & overly sentimental moments that nearly derails the whole picture. The best scene is of course the tsunami sequence for it is captured in quite an unflinching, brutal & raw manner plus looks highly authentic while the rest of its technical aspects are nicely executed.Coming to the performances, The Impossible features a fine cast in Naomi Watts & Ewan McGregor and while the former does a great job in one of her most commanding roles, the latter does a good job as well. The rest of the cast, especially the child actors, also chip in finely in their given roles but the writing part is handled so badly that it's difficult to take it seriously sometimes.On an overall scale, The Impossible advertises itself as a heart-pounding tale about human kindness rising against the deadliest calamity of 21st century yet it tries so hard to evoke a sympathetic response from its viewers that its aspired realism simply goes out the window. Entertaining for many, rewarding for some & a good cinema overall if not a bad one, The Impossible is worth a shot.",,Anonymous,History

The phrase 'emotional roller-coaster' is used too often....,"****SPOILER ALERT *****The phrase 'emotional roller-coaster' is used too often....But in this case I can't sum up the diversity of emotions that I felt whilst watching this movie in any other way. I knew it would tug on my heart strings purely due to the subject matter and the pre-release material that I'd seen. What I didn't expect is that a film, a movie, a piece of celluloid would tap into the most base emotions of my 'lizard brain' as the scientists call it. As a father with a son of the same age as the main child in this I felt myself pulled into the family's plight, decisions and ultimate salvation like no other film I've ever seen.If I was to criticise though, the ending was terribly cheesy - the mum fighting towards the light to survive her surgery and then all the family are greeted by a representative of the father's employers, a large bank and taken to a private plane past lines of grieving survivors only to have the plane to themselves with rows of empty seats when they could've helped others.Overall a magnificent film though and one that the cinematographer must get nominated for an Oscar for the tsunami scenes which were breath-takingly realistic.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent Handling,"In 2004, a British couple based in Japan and their three sons are vacationing in Thailand when the Indian Ocean Tsunami strikes.It's got quite a cast, with Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts as the couple, and Tom Holland (in his first credited role) as the eldest of the three boys. They each rise to the occasion in the disaster, and their acting is excellent. But it's a disaster movie, and the big question is how is the tsunami strike handled. It's done through a combination of practical effects and model work and very well handled.I can't help but wonder when I see a movie like this: what about the people with very brief roles? What happened to them? We can rejoice in the survival of the central characters. But what about the young man who took them to their rooms? Looking at it clinically, that's a comment on the excellence of the overall verisimilitude of the movie. But in reality, almost a quarter of a milion people died.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Sappy, yet effective.","If the only objective of ""The Impossible"" was to make an entire theater full of grown adults cry, then MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! Based on the ""true story"" of a (Spanish?) family who survived (not a spoiler alert, only because this movie was seemingly made to be utterly predictable) the 2004 tsunami which hit South Asia, ""The Impossible"", directed by Juan Antonio Bayona (The Orphanage) in incredibly impressive fashion and containing fairly compelling performances from the likes of Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor, would have been assuredly one of the best films of 2012 (and an Oscar contender) if only it wasn't hampered by an overbearingly sappy script, with plotting worthy of The Lifetime Channel, from Sergio G. Sanchez.While Sanchez's plot development makes ""The Impossible"" one of the most predictable movies you will ever see, this aspect doesn't actually hinder the film as much as one would expect. For one, during the initial act, the fact that audiences are fully aware of the impending doom, works as a form of suspense on the same level as a well crafted horror film would. Secondly, the payoff (which is drenched in predictability) during the climax, shockingly works immensely well due to a lot of help from a well choreographed sequence from Bayona. Furthermore, though this was truly a climax which everybody in the theater could and will see coming from a mile away, it is ""impossible"" to not be swept away (figuratively) in the moment; no matter how cynical a movie-goer you may be. As for the middle chunk of ""The Impossible"", it rides that fine line between visual excellence and a forced ""triumph of the human spirit"" storyline, with the reoccurring theme of sappiness rearing its head again and again and once more, directly following the great climax with an eye rolling prolonged ending.Side Note: Kudos to the director for not shying away from showing the most realistic depiction possible of the people who lived through and died during this tsunami. And by that I don't just mean the violence and gruesomeness of people drowning and being impaled by large pieces of debris, but more so the amount of nudity, i.e. not going the American PG-13 rout of showing us tsunami victims who are cut up, arms broken and eyes popping out of their head, but with clothes still intact. With that said, while nothing in this film is gratuitous (aside from the gratuitous sappiness) how this movie passed without an R rating with the amount of Naomi Watts' breasts shown, during a time when American parents are more afraid of their thirteen year old seeing a woman's exposed nipple than a movie riddled with gun violence, is one of the most impressive things I've seen in an American distributed film in quite a while. In short, if you where planning on seeing this movie with your kids, then see this movie with your kids; a little breast never hurt anybody.Final Thought: Though I still stand by my point that the overwhelmingly forced pathos throughout does drag this film down a bit, I will say ""The Impossible"" contains some of the most impressive visuals of 2012; just falling short of Ang Lee's ""Life of Pi"". But still the most overwhelming aspect that this film has going for it, is how eventually (and quite forcefully) it pulls at the heartstrings so much so, that much like those SPCA commercials, you won't be able to help yourself but choose the emotional response of ""that poor family"", rather than a rational one of ""this isn't that great of a movie"".Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

Wow An Incredible Must See,"This is one of the best best movies of all time, superb acting and directing makes this movie a must see, bring lots of tissues.Naomi Watts as always over delivers, and is truly incredible in this one.The child actors are so very talented, and really make this film so real that you forget you are watching a movie and really live this tragedy out with them.I am really disappointed and it's hard to believe that this was not nominated for a Golden Globe and the lame Quentin Terantino film was, this beats Django Unchained hands down.It seems that often times Hollywood makes strange choices at these awards shows.",10.0,Anonymous,History
What people are forgetting...,"... the film is BASED on a true family. Just because they are a white British family who have travel insurance (which everyone tends to get when they go on holiday) doesn't mean that the film is a LIE. Has it crossed your minds that the Spanish family may have been just as well off and also got travel insurance?? In my opinion, as long as the actors represent a true feeling and represented the family it is based on in a good way regardless of what race they are, THATS what makes a film good. Geeeez...And as for those wanting a film about all the Thai people who suffered terribly during this time, please do not see the film as this is solely about ONE family events. This is THE only family in which the film delves in. Please remember this is about a family's experience and events during the tsunami in Thailand, not a factual documentary.As for the film itself, I thought the VFX was absolutely out of the world. Amazingly realistic! I do think the writing could've been slightly better, but then again, who am I to judge, they are the ones making the big bucks!",8.0,Anonymous,History
Awesome,"My first review on IMDb! I have watched a new movie everyday for the past two years, i do not consider myself a critic or talk badly about any film. I simply give my opinion, i do not hate. Too many reviewers on this website strictly write reviews just to hate. I'm gonna be the guy who tells you that your wrong. Every movie has a spark in every movie goers heart. Whether its the characters, the plot, the dialogue, the special effects etc... You critics should find the good in every movie instead of focusing on the things you hate. This move first and foremost may not win best picture, it may not be an 8.0, it may not be accurate, but what it is, is inspirational. This film moved me like no other, and to argue such stupid things as financial status is repulsive. Do people honestly think that having a deep bank account helps you when your faced with a Tsunami? Does having money make you swim better? IMDb is riddled with negative couch- potatos talking down on other peoples work. Work hard and do it for yourself. Then try to brace the magnificence of this movie and you will fail. I hope you succeed to see the hatred and ignorance.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Decent,but not outstanding","After the Tsunami, the rest of the story is less compelliing, even if based on a true story. That said, the actual disaster is terrifying to watch, and this is worth watching just for that.",7.0,Anonymous,History
The Impossible,"In 2007, Spanish no-namer Juan Antonio Bayona released his debut film, ""El Orfanato,"" or as we English speaking folk say, ""The Orphanage."" I saw that film based on glowing recommendations from a few people I follow on Twitter, who's opinions regarding movies tend to be similar to mine. Despite those recommendations, I didn't have huge expectations going in. A horror flick from an unknown director; how good could it be? I was blown away, and instantly made a note to remember this talented director whose artistic vision proved to be entrancing and hypnotic.Five years later, he's returned with ""The Impossible."" You probably remember the awful disaster that took place in southeast Asia in 2004. It was all over the news, and the estimated death toll capped 230 thousand. ""The Impossible"" tells the true story of a family that survived the disaster, and despite the PG-13 rating, the images shown on screen are gruesomely realistic. Calling ""The Impossible"" the best disaster movie ever made doesn't even do it justice, because it's something more. It's a heartwrenching, captivating, and moving tale; and one of the very best films of the year.The film tells the true story of Maria and Henry Bellon, played flawlessly by Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor, and their three children, Lucas, Simon, and Thomas, and their awe-aspiring story of survival. Lucas is played by a young actor named Tom Holland, and his performance blew me away. Watching the film, I was perhaps SO impressed because I assumed Holland was twelve or thirteen, similar to the age of his character. He's actually sixteen, but, nevertheless, the performance remains a great one. There is; however, an even greater performance that deserves recognition. The brilliant Naomi Watts is pitch-perfect in the lead role as Maria, the family member who came closest to increasing the tsunami's death toll by one. There will be an injustice if she doesn't finally get the Best Actress Oscar she's deserved for so long. After her haunting and hypnotic showing in ""Mulholland Dr."", and her powerful performance in ""21 Grams"", she still remains Oscar-less. I'm not saying it's right to hand someone an Oscar because they are overdue. Watts deserves it. In my eyes, the only other real contender, despite great displays of acting from Jessica Chastain, Emmanuelle Riva, Mary Elisabeth-Winstead, and Marion Cotillard, is Jennifer Lawrence for her fantastic work in ""Silver Linings Playbook"". The difference between the two performances, I think, is only that Naomi's performance is more inspired. Someone lived what she acted. I'd like to see Naomi win Best Actress, and I'd like to see the real Maria Bellon up on stage to accept the award with her.Another important aspect of ""The Impossible"" to note is its stunning visual spectacle. This is a film a few years in the making that shows time was taken to create a realism in the production design and special effects that leaves a startling impact. It should definitely receive a Best Visual Effects nomination come Thursday, instead of films like ""The Avengers"" or ""Skyfall,"" because it's recreated real life, not just playing with fire and making the sky look cool. ""The Impossible"" is a film of power and a film of importance, and it should be treated as such. I urge you to flock to the theaters and see this movie. It's an experience unlike any other, and it'll take a piece out of you.",9.0,Anonymous,History
This Movie is Truth in that it Lies,"The trivia section notes ""the Ball was Yellow not Red, as shown in the film. Maria Belón said it was the ""biggest lie"" in the movie."" How can that be the biggest lie in the movie when the film based on her Spanish family's story are portrayed as being English? What other lies are there?Many reviewers have criticized the movie for that portrayal and that the film does little to portray the Thai that died (nor the Sri Lankans for that matter). Don't they see that is the truth of the story being told that it is a Hollywood world?Did any of them try to fund a version that told a different story? Did any of them reach out to help the victims other than to criticize this movie? What help is that? How different is that than some film company making a profit for telling this tale? Perhaps the outcry would have been even greater had they portrayed the Thai victims and made money for that.When the son lies to his Mom that her leg is still red (and hence well) it is a metaphor for the whole story that things are not well in how the incident has impacted civilization and belies the lie that Hollywood Culture (you and I who watch this film) cares.I was grief stricken when this disaster struck and reached out to friends who were in the area. Sure enough they were greatly affected having been swept away in the path of the tsunami. I contributed nothing to the relief fund. (My donations go to Wildlife Conservation)This is just a movie; it helps to remind that the disaster happened and that concern for extent of the disaster is a Western perspective. We are not one with the world - therein lies the truth of the lies - we don't care.The special effects and editing were superb - it was so realistic 10 out of 10. The story and acting so so - a 5 out of 10 for an average of 7. For revealing our lies - priceless.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent,"Go and see the movie. Enjoy it, get emotional and hope you never experience anything similar. Just the right amount of artistic licence to make it a successful movie without taking anything away from portraying this terrible event in a sympathetic way. runamokprods review should not be given much credence. He is just another politically correct tree hugger who sees racism under every rock. This sort of attitude does more to further racism than it does to stamp it out.

The Impossible,"After a bit of a bumpy flight to Thailand, a family arrive in Phuket for what ought to have been a dream holiday. Well mother nature had other plans and a earthquake far out at sea generated a series of tsunamis that we now know killed almost a quarter of a million people. That could well have included ""Henry"" (Ewan McGregor), ""Maria"" (Naomi Watts) and their children ""Lucas"" (Tom Holland), ""Simon"" (Oaklee Pendergast) and ""Thomas"" (Samuel Joslin) but despite being out in the first wave of the encroaching water, they somehow manage to cling onto anything that will float, to the sturdy trunks of the trees and though separated do survive. That's just the start of their troubles, though - ""Maria"" is severely injured and with their elder and quite smart son ""Lukas"". The others - so we are fortunately spared much of the mediocre McGregor - are elsewhere with all looking to repatriate amidst the chaos of debris and mayhem left by the now retreated seawater. The thrust of the drama features mother and son, with quite decent and convincing efforts from both as they must make it to some semblance of safety and then try to get much needed medical help. It's based on the real event, and the photography quite potently illustrates just how devastating the waves were on these low lying islands that were designed for pleasure and tranquility - there were no sea defences and the structures ill-prepared for the sheer power of the swell. There's a spirit to the narrative too - the locals and the tourists all mucking together to help in a veritable hotchpotch of languages and priorities. The pacing is frenetic at times, lingering at others and that also helps give us a sense of the perils faced by all trying to come to terms with the destruction and this is a surprisingly better watch than I was expecting.",7.0,Anonymous,History
save time,"Easily the worst full feature film seen in my memory, and that in the context that I patiently allow my wife to make most film choices, many that I might otherwise skip.Here, every event, every maudlin word can be predicted. Admittedly the context, the tsunami constrains the plot, but that does not make it forgivable. Makes for a constant dread of the next events, the next dialog.I enjoy both complicated, slow drama, and an occasional action film. My point is here that my film diet is varied, and it is not some genre bias.What is most difficult to fathom is the immensely strong 7.6 rating, many thousands of voters. Many films attain a high early glow that get tempered in time, settling eventually to a less exuberant level. This is a 2012 film, currently 2013, but the high rating is still incomprehensible.",1.0,Anonymous,History
What an awesome story,"I loved this movie.This is a tear jerker though...I cried a few times during this, because I could only imagine what those parents went through; not knowing where your children or your spouse are! I felt especially bad for the mom, because I am a mom myself, and would have gone crazy with worry if this had happened to me.If you like natural disaster movies and you like a little suspense and are not too faint at heart, I recommend you watch this. And best of all, it has a good ending.I would like to see more of this type of movie, it keeps you glued to the end and it (for me) had a good amount of suspense in it. Cant believe that it is a true story though, with everything this family had to go through. It makes you appreciate your own life more! The only down side was that I would have loved to have gotten to know the main characters a little better before the action began.Other than that...Brilliant!",10.0,Anonymous,History
A Nutshell Review: The Impossible,"One of the largest earthquakes in the region sparked off one of the worst ever tsunamis to hit our planet at multiple geographies, I still remember the relative calm back in that December of 2004 just after Christmas, until reality set in with the first images of the chaos that's to come through. Disasters have always proved to be fodder for filmmakers, and the challenge here is not to make them overly sentimental, or worse, seem exploitative in treatment.Clint Eastwood's Hereafter had the same disaster form the premise of his film, but in this Spanish production, we get the narrative centered around the incident proper in Phuket, where a holidaying family get caught up in this unfortunate moment in history, and we go through their respective struggles to battle fear, confusion, shock, loss and root for their reconciliation, forming just but a snapshot of most of the emotions that survivors would likely have gone through. With a true story of a family's experience forming the inspiration behind Maria Belon and Sergio G. Sanchez's story and screenplay, The Impossible boasts both technical brilliance as well as wonderful acting by its leading cast to draw you into those fateful days, putting you smack where the action is.Husband and wife Henry (Ewan McGregor) and Maria (Naomi Watts), and their three kids Lucas (Tom Holland), Simon (OAklee Pendergast) and Thomas (Samuel Joslin) are spending their Christmas week in Phuket, only for the ocean to come up and swallow a lot of land. And by now we would know the devastating effects a tsunami would have as waters sweep inward, gets drawn outward back to the sea, before the next wave comes in again. This gets repeated, with each cycle having the waves becoming smaller, but still bringing about plenty of debris and whatever it had uprooted and moved, making the undercurrents extremely fraught with danger.While Hereafter had some cheap special effects for sequences of the disaster proper, director Juan Antonio Bayona had a more incredible design and experience for the audience, with models being key to his presentation, and knowing exactly just how to keep tension, and the transmission of fear, vivid through the survive, sink or swim perspective of Maria and Lucas. This goes on for minutes, and it's extremely harrowing. Sound design is also excellent, with the roar of waters overhead perfectly contrasting the muted underwater scenes, which in itself is in ironic sync given its busy undercurrents with debris smashing into one's body, and the need to get onto higher ground, dry land, or just about any flotation device or tree up above. And Bayona doesn't just end it here, knowing that his money shots in this sequence becomes yet another perfect metaphor for Maria later on as well.It's a tale told in two parts, with Maria and Lucas' storyline highlighting the chaos that ensued after the waters subside, and the assistance rendered by good Samaritan villagers who do what they could in order to save lives. Bayona doesn't shy away from the more difficult shots of both showing the devastation of property, and the loss of human lives, and with an excellent make up team to bring about a vivid portrayal of those injured, or at the brink of death. Whatever they put on Naomi Watts made her look genuinely sick, and undoubtedly helped in her performance, nominated for various awards to date. But it's Tom Holland whom I thought stole the show in their arc, as the young boy faced with fear and uncertainty, both on the condition of his mom, as well as that in the chaos in hospital, with a little bit of humanity weaved in as he goes about reuniting strangers, albeit treated quite lightly, and coincidentally, given the more perplexing and frustrating time where the lack of records for obvious reasons hindered, and sapped emotional strength as hope faded with each passing day.The other storyline deals with Henry, his other two boys and a family's search for their remaining members, expanding upon Lucas' experience in one location, to that of hitting multiple hospitals and shelter locations, in addition to the difficulties of moving forward and ahead to abandon places already searched. Bayona kept it rather safe here with only fleeting shots of bodies and body bags, never lingering more than necessary. McGregor's character moves with survivors in their respective searches for family, which gives rise to opportunities to showcase how strangers come together, pulling resources and lending morale support, with some who had to hardened their hearts and understandably seeking to consolidate whatever they have in a me-first situation. Again the children Samuel Joslin and Oaklee Pendergast, while not having as big a role as Tom Holland, were the highlight here, stealing McGregor's thunder easily, and you'll be hard pressed not to find your eyes a little damp from time to time.Some may find fault with its convenient wrap, or take issue with the family's resources at the finale, but these happen to be what's available as resources at the time, and it's not too far fetched to finish rather strongly. After all, this is a film about the human spirit in times of disaster, and an account of their experiences in pulling through their ordeal. For sure there are countless of stories centered around the same event, but I suppose these are stories that would be told by other filmmakers. For now, Juan Antonio Bayona's film stands out as one of the best efforts both technically and creatively, capturing the horror and celebrating triumph in the smallest of ways, with all round fine delivery by its cast both well known, and young. A definite recommend!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Good movie but far too drawn out!,"The Impossible is no doubt a heart-wrenching true story that tugs on all the right strings BUT the lingering stares and slow motioned pauses tend to make you frustrated. No one needs to watch them gaze back and forth for 30 seconds every ten minutes to understand or feel the emotions they were going through. I had very high hopes for this movie especially because the true life story was something I begged a year ago to become a movie so we could even get a glimpse of the horror that this family survived and because it is the true history that happened and forever changed the world and brought awareness to this very unexpected natural disaster. Don't get me wrong, the acting from the kids especially was SUPERB! And yes, I cried. I just wish they hadn't drawn out the unimportant parts, that's all.",,Anonymous,History
Realistic,"A very sad and exciting movie based on a true story. First of all, actors and actress did an excellent job. They've all done a good job. I've been obsessed with tsunami movies lately. I was putting this movie off for a long time because I knew it was a family drama. First of all, the movie is very good. I watched how they shot the tsunami scenes on youtube, it's very good, they used cgi of course, but many of the scenes have practical effects and this made the movie realistic. There were a few cliché scenes that I didn't like in the movie, it would have been better had it not been.It's also a Spanish movie.Good movie, watch it.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A challenge for everyone involved that was beautifully and maturely handled,"The one thing consistent with all disaster films is you can never sit comfortably within the opening scenes because you often know what is coming and you just can bear the thought of it. J.A. Bayona's The Impossible is a picture that captures a disaster all too realistically, as it depicts the tsunami that devastated Southeast Asia in 2004, killing an upwards of 300,000, destroying homes, soiling towns, and leaving families and memories in drenched and irreplaceable shambles. The thought of the last thing one sees is a wall of filthy, rushing water coming towards you at a breakneck speed is unthinkable.We center on Henry and Maria Bennett (Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts) and their three children Lucas (Tom Holland), Thomas (Samuel Joslin), and Simon (Oaklee Pendergast) who are on holiday in Thailand at a gorgeous resort when a tsunami from the Indian Ocean rushes into the mainland, destroying every thing in its path. Trees are taken right out of the ground, cars are trampled, houses are destroyed, people are taken for a ride underwater that they may not come out of, etc.During the scenes of the tsunami, we are provided with harrowing images of bodies being flung and tossed underwater. Maria, herself, is thrown into numerous items of debris, including impaling her leg on a tree branch and almost having her breast taken off. When the water finally ceases, Maria and Lucas wind up reconnecting and venture to find some sort of relief and hopefully find the rest of their family. In the process, they take a young boy named Daniel along, who was almost crushed by failing rubble. He is a sweet little tyke, whose innocence is captured beautifully, including a scene where he comforts Maria (who keep in mind is still a stranger) by softly rubbing her hair in the face of tragedy. The scene itself is absolutely adorable, evoking the beauty of human sympathy.Meanwhile, Henry, Thomas, and Simon are still at the resort, with Henry being scratched and bloodied, but still able-bodied unlike his wife. He tells his children to stick with a larger group while he searches for mom and Lucas, and the story of a family hoping to reunite with each other ventures on.I've often discussed emotional manipulation and how much I dislike it. I feel it's a road filmmakers go down to achieve an undeserved sentimental reaction. Instead of using tactics of the screenwriter, films often use unnecessary events that evoke sadness and usually buoys them with an obvious soundtrack. The Impossible uses some of that, mainly along the lines of musical manipulation, yet there's so much detail, humanity, and life that comes along with this tragedy that one could easily forget about all that. Films like Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close and the more recent Les Misérables are more to an advantage in the idea of emotional manipulation because they can simply say something like, ""look at these very depressing people."" They emptily showcase depression, where The Impossible almost forces you to put yourself in the shoes of this family and think what you would do.I think my biggest problem with The Impossible, even though it does so much right, is the fact that the film takes place in Thailand, the story we're given is based off the true events of a Spanish family, and the cast is almost unanimously white. It's a subtle feature, that isn't a complete turn off unless you make it one, but it's a little disconcerting and questionable that the characters the film primarily focuses on are white in a country that is certainly complete in its Asian and Spanish demographic.Yet I'll stop there before I start some race war I do not plan to fight. It's a petty feature that shouldn't distract from the film at hand. I stated in my review of Life of Pi that it was the most emotional movie event of the year, and that I found Les Misérables underwhelming emotionally. This film reassured that I could still be greatly effected by a film in strong, moving ways. There are several scenes in The Impossible that evoke tears, so many actually that I left the theater physically and mentally exhausted. One scene in particular is when Henry is with many other people in the dead of night, with a man passing around a cell phone urging them to call their loved ones. Henry calls his close friend, and through tears explains vaguely what happened before assuring he'll reconnect with his wife and son before hanging up. The man tells Henry that he can not end a conversation like that and gives the phone back to Henry, who elaborates more clearly the second time around. It's a simple scene, likely to go unnoticed by many viewers of the film, but it shows the magnitude of the situation to such a degree that you can't even coherently explain it without sobbing or simply questioning it to certain extremes.Naomi Watts has just been nominated for Best Actress in the 85th Academy Awards, and her role deserves it. While she spends much of the film barely conscious and clinging on to life on a hospital bed, she is given a very physically demanding role that challenges a performer to provide the audience members with believability and sentiment and she achieves it through a heart-wrenching, motherly performance. McGregor does fine work as a conflicted father, and the children, mainly Tom Holland, are quite capable here, expressing their innocence in several sequences, including the fear of seeing your mother in great pain when you're used to seeing it the other way around. The Impossible is one of the most affecting disaster films in quite sometime, and one of the saddest dramas of the 2012 year.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A family in the midst of dramatic events,"This is a good film, with good direction and acting. Even the script, the usual weakness of American movies is quite good. Not everything that is said is a plot device and most of the stuff that is shown in the film is based on actual facts.The problem that I had with the film was the way the tsunami was really something in the background, as were the actions of other people. There was so much focus on what do and feel the five members of the family that anything else felt blurry. It has to do with my own expectations, which were to gain insight in the disaster itself, rather than the emotional hardships of a single family caught in it.The action scenes were spectacular, I grant you that. To see in detail what happens to a human body caught in a massive wave filled with debris is shocking. The emotional scenes were OK, mostly. The soundtrack was appropriate, but it annoyed me to no end. Really, I can feel for myself, chill with the violins already!Bottom line: There are some gruesome scenes in the film, but it is mostly character acting and dialogue. The focus is only on one five member family and, after quite an emotional journey, the movie ends. It is a good movie, something that I would recommend, but I didn't feel it was out of the ordinary.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Made for Lifetime...,"The 3 stars are for the effects.Dreadful ""Made for Lifetime"" movie. Better suited to women on a Sunday night while husbands are watching the playoffs upstairs!No time at all was spent on the actual tsunami build up. It just suddenly happens and then it's over. We are treated to about 5 minutes of CGI effects within the opening 20 minutes. The rest of this film follows people around who are looking for other people.How anyone could believe that the gorgeous actress had ever had three kids... well, you get the idea.If you like overly melodramatic slush then this may hold some appeal.Just because it actually happened and/or is true to how it went down doesn't mean that 50 million bucks should be spent turning it into movie.This movie is awful all round and badly managed from start to finish.",3.0,Anonymous,History
"Interesting, very realistic, not overly sentimental either","Many Swedes were killed in this tsunami, so it has become like a national tragedy for us, despite of the fact that it took place so far away. The aftermath is still not altogether over, as many people feel it took too long for the Swedish Government to send help to the stranded Swedes.Personally I am of the opinion, that the Swedish Government cannot be responsible for earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, snake-bites etc.. If Swedes of their own free will choose to leave Sweden for latitudes where these phenomena occur, and in addition to that do not care about getting valid travel insurance, which was sometimes the case... And especially when there had been heavy cuts in the support to vulnerable groups in Sweden, who could never in their lives even dream of a vacation in Thailand... But now we are off topic.I have often wondered what happened to those survivors I know, who came back. They have not wanted to talk about it. I was glad to get this opportunity to try to understand what they went through.I can of course not know how authentic it all is, as I was not there, but the feeling of this movie, at least, is very realistic. I like it that it is not overly-sentimental either, despite of the subject matter that could very well have been made into a melodrama.The actors are all very good, and the child-actors especially are excellent. I do not think I have ever seen any children acting so believably! This is an interesting and exciting movie, with no dull moments, that has a special impact as you know it really happened. And not far back in time either. I highly recommend it!",9.0,Anonymous,History
As Good as Most People Say It Is,"Though it's a straightforwardly based-upon-a-true story, THE IMPOSSIBLE still has its share of surprises and turnabouts. The cover blurb from Mary Pols (TIME) says ""Emotionally rich and life-affirming."" I agree, but it should also be noted that this film earns every bit of its various life-affirming qualities. The initial scenes of the tsunami and its aftermath are heart-stopping in places: This is definitely one of the more disturbing PG-13s that I've seen. It's also the first film I've seen in a long while that honestly brought tears to my eyes.While the pacing could use a little more of this and a little less of that, THE IMPOSSIBLE is expertly filmed and acted. Lush scenery too: It made me want to go to Thailand in spite of everything shown here. Fine performances by Watts and McGregor, with special kudos going to Tom Holland as eldest son Lucas. The Special Features are all worth a serious look.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Dumb,I didnt like the movie was very dumb and so damn stupid.,,Anonymous,History
A Curate's Egg of a movie,"The actual tsunami is well done; this and the scenes immediately after are gruelling and hard to watch - lots of blood and pain, near-drowning etc. Then the movie settles down into an old-fashioned 'search for lost family members' type of pic with all the sentimental manipulation that involves. Much of the film leaves a poor impression - it replaces the actual Spanish family with a classic middle-class English whose members display all the mannerisms and behaviour you would expect right down to the heroic eldest son who saves his mother etc (Admittedly a fine performance from young Tom Holland). The film is blatantly manipulative, the music swells in all the expected places and so it's hard to feel genuinely moved by the family's plight. Just as irritating is the fact that much of the filming is by hand-held camera and after half-an-hour or so I began to feel distinctly queasy. I really do wish directors would put out of their heads the notion that realism can only be depicted by use of the hand-held camera.",6.0,Anonymous,History
amazing movie,The impossible is literally amazing. i loved the whole movie. the character Lucas was an amazing actor. really the whole cast was. very realistic and tear jerking. spoiler alert: there is a lot of blood so any one under the age of 10 or something wouldn't like this. (in my point of view) go see it! all the bad reviews are saying how the movie is bad because it is about a white family. that is true but its not bad... its a movie i mean really people? well i hope to see the actors in more stuff later on. the sad part is that this actually happened to people. gosh i don't think ill ever go to Thailand.. but really its an amazing movie so don't listen to the bad reviews and go out there and see it! you'll come out with a changed heart and tears in your eyes.,10.0,Anonymous,History

A true nightmare depicted on screen; definitely worth the watch if you can handle it!,"'THE IMPOSSIBLE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A Spanish dramatic thriller (presented in English) recounting one family's true experiences during the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. It stars Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor both in highly critically praised performances (and reuniting after starring together in the 2005 thriller 'STAY'). It also stars Tom Holland as their 12-year-old son and he makes an amazing debut performance. It was directed by Juan Antonio Bayona and written by Sergio G. Sanchez (based on a story by Maria Belon). The same team made the 2007 critically acclaimed Spanish thriller 'THE ORPHANAGE'; which was a little more of a spooky supernatural thriller type (produced by Guillermo del Toro), where as this is definitely more of a disaster/drama film. The movie has been praised and condemned for it's believable and shockingly realistic depiction of one of the most disastrous natural catastrophes in history. It's a true nightmare depicted on screen and is definitely worth the watch if you can handle it.The film focuses on Maria (Watts) and Henry Belon (McGregor) as they vacation in Thailand for Christmas with their three sons: Lucas (Holland), Thomas (Samuel Joslin) and Simon (Oaklee Pendergast). On December 26, 2004 they're all enjoying their time in a swimming pool, at the resort they're staying at, when the tsunami hits the coast and wipes them all out. Maria and Lucas are swept away but manage to find each other (although Maria is severely injured) as Henry recovers his other two sons. The rest of the movie is spent following Henry as he searches aimlessly for his wife and eldest son and Lucas as he looks after his mother at a emergency hospital.The film is truly nightmarish to watch as the opening tsunami scene is probably the most believable natural disaster scene ever depicted on film. The rest of the movie is just as haunting though as we watch this family in utter despair struggling to survive and find each other (while also watching thousands of other strangers experience the horror as well). The movie almost plays out like a horror film at times (which is probably due to the director and writer's brilliant touches) but it does pay off with a heartfelt and tear soaked conclusion. The film is inspirational in the way it depicts this real life family's strength, love and determination but it also leaves a somewhat depressing and eerie feeling after it's over. This is not a movie you watch to have fun (despite how spectacular the visuals are and Bayona's direction is very beautiful at times as well). Watts does deliver one of the most powerful performances of the year, as well as her career, and McGregor does some of his best work as well. When you think you feel up to sitting through a movie like this it's definitely worth the watch.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xLp95d1OTk",9.0,Anonymous,History
"A moving and touching film and even with its dramas, the script is strong and impactful, enveloping you completely and rooting for the characters","Maria and Henry (Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor) are the parents of Lucas, Thomas and Simon (respectively, Tom Holland, Samuel Joslin and Oaklee Pendergast), all still small. Even if Henry is worried about his professional situation, the family believes that spending Christmas week in Thailand will be the best antidote to forget any worries. Briefly, we accompany this quintet having fun like any tourist. However, what was supposed to be a peaceful trip turns into a nightmare when this family is hit by a tsunami that invades the leisure area of the hotel where they are staying.Excesses, however, are not present in the 100 minutes of ""Lo Imposible"" just as a banal spectacle of the misery of others, detailing the damage imposed on the bodies of the characters who try to survive in the face of an atypical situation in their lives. It is the reiteration of the suffering of those who told the story, narrated through strategies that involve stunning memories, transformed into cinema, an art of exhaustion of emotions by mixing auditory and visual elements. Therefore, the drama is exposed in the production as something developed in favor of the dramatic quality of the film. We live in a time of so much mistrust that any solidary posture is seen with suspicion and as cheap sentimentality. What's more, if the film focused on more characters, many people would be bothered by the dispersive posture and the lack of any depth in the presentation of the characters.In its first seconds of exhibition, ""Lo Imposible"" already makes a point of justifying its own title. Emphasizing the fact that it is based on a true story, the film even sounds ironic with other productions that have already carried the same words in their opening credits. But what has to be told is so fantastic that Sergio G. Sanchez's script thinks it's worth the caveat. In fact, we are facing incredible facts, which would become corny if invented by the head of some screenwriter full of ""creativity"". However, Sanchez and Bayona seem so impressed with what they have in their hands that they make this story such an intense roller coaster of emotions that it almost always sounds just cinematic, and not an adaptation of real life. From the first minute, when it makes the spectator confuse the noise of an airplane turbine with that of the gigantic wave entering the city, the direction of Bayona seeks to keep the tension always high. During the first act, in which it is possible to universalize the condition to which this family is exposed, the filmmaker still holds back. He turns the tsunami invasion, with the help of a very competent visual effects team, into a fantastic horror show, in which it is possible to have a real notion of how devastating and deadly the wave was. It is impossible not to be impressed. From then on, however, the Spaniard is losing his hand. It exaggerates. He seems to want to force the viewer to cry.Even with its dramas, the script is strong and impactful, enveloping you completely and rooting for the characters. Director Juan Antonio Bayona knew how to film everything firmly. Its static camera, as well as the shaky one; it's devastating. He knew how to use slow motion effects, sound effects, muted effects, a sad melody, a simple but well-crafted script, a first-rate cast with young novices. He used all of this with conviction in the story he wanted to tell. Beautiful scenes permeate the work. Among them is the one that Naomi and her eldest son find a little boy, and he himself without knowing her, takes her hand tenderly. But my favorite is the one where one of the younger boys is looking at the stars, and a lady survivor says that many stars are already dead. The boy asks how to know which stars are alive or dead. You say it's impossible to know. This lyrical, poetic and inspiring scene sums up the entire film. Just as we are happy to see a glimmer of something we don't even know is alive or dead; it's the faith of something that seems impossible that can make the difference in moving forward or not. Poetry in film form.With the clear intention of emotion, no other possibility that the story could yield is deepened. None of the drama of destroyed families, of residents in the midst of a state of public calamity, of the repercussions, context and consequences of that incident. Only that family is interested in trying to overcome a collective tragedy individually - and another lost child helped by Lucas and his mother is just an excuse for not having that impression. It's too little to count as a worthy cinematic effort, let alone cry now or feel numb forever. Emotions are presented without philosophy or the complexity of pompous dialogues. Here, it is the gaze, the testimony of the pain of others and the need to understand oneself within the tragic process that makes the film grow exponentially. Some characters make brief passages, either to leave a message or reinforce the importance of putting yourself in the other's shoes in such a chaotic situation. To make us more emotional viewers, J. A. Bayona had an efficient production team, made up of top professionals, aware of making a film with a high budget, something that influenced the quality of the visual and special effects, supervised by the team of Eduardo Diaz , believable at all times, from exasperation at the wave that behaved like a monster to the details of the make-up, whether in the wounds on the bodies of the characters in deep agony or in the most panoramic scenes with the mighty waters of the ocean dominating the territory and vertiginously dragging everything it finds along the way.In ""Lo Imposible"", Bayona made a drama with horror filling. Why? Because there comes another strong point of the film: the realism of wounds and suffering. Even with all the emotion and tears, the film brings raw scenes of mutilation, scratches and deaths. The scenes in hospitals and villages after the giant wave are heartbreaking. The make-up, signed by Tomar Aviv, gives the film credibility in the aesthetic sector, not only being the shattering of human bodies, but the symbolization of the hell of pain and uncertainty, something that dominated the thoughts of everyone who was in this situation. Inserted in a situation where they need to overcome their physical limits, the characters of ""Lo Imposible"" also go through an agonizing psychological journey, something that is probably a scar to be followed throughout their lives. Furthermore, unlike many films of the genre, the text earns points for avoiding Hollywood's scientific discourse, which is usually steeped in unknown terms and explanations for the phenomenon, in an effort to give the overall content an extra dose of credibility. The emotions here are geared toward human drama. Enough, by the way, and responsible for holding the narrative that after the spectacle of the initial nature, it does not remain concerned with exposing more and more waves and incessant destruction.Due to the seriousness of his mother's condition, Lucas ends up maturing prematurely and feels obliged to help her, which also awakens in the boy the need to help others injured by the disaster. By the way, a surprising performance by the young Tom Holland. Marvel's future Spider-Man, making his big-screen debut with an astonishing performance, power and vigor. On the other hand, Henry finds himself alone amidst the rubble until he finds his other two children, who left physically unharmed by the giant wave attack. McGregor dives into the character and, in one of the most striking moments of the production, makes a phone call to one of his relatives and cries copiously when he realizes, aloud, how desperate it is to be away from his family.Finally, we come to her, Naomi Watts. The film is absolutely hers. Most of the scenes carry her on her back, whether in survival or in scenes of greater despair. In at least three moments her performance is visceral, intriguing, strong, human and in most of these scenes she acts without saying a single word. These are scenes where a look, a smile or a sigh say it all. In scenes of just a few seconds, she conveys fear, terror, despair, but above all; willpower to survive, to be able to embrace her husband and children again. Disheartening, beautiful and chilling.Of course, there are mannerisms in Lo Imposible, especially in the disagreements between children, brothers and father in the scenes that precede the possible family reunion while Maria agonizes on the hospital stretcher. Perhaps this slippery hamper the narrative a little, which until then had been well conducted in an atmosphere of tension and natural drama. The question remains whether that moment of meeting for everyone really came about that way. After all, the film is based on true events. Not just of the tragedy, but of Maria and Henry's family. However, this small slip does not detract from the film, even more so when the director also shows that the happy ending is not for everyone and the camera focuses on several people in search of news of their relatives, crying when they see the list of dead or simply lost and standing in a corner with a sad look. Bayona also avoids turning the tsunami into a big spectacle by skimping on the wide shots that show the devastation caused by the wave, which draws your attention to its characters. It's really to get emotional, but not for gimmicks. And yes, because a tragedy of this size cannot be measured.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Cashing in on tragedies...,"This movie was told from the wrong point of view. It was sort of an insult in a way that director J.A. Bayona decided to focus on a rich white tourist family and not on a local Thai family. It just made the movie tacky and somewhat distasteful.This is my first, and last, time to watch ""The Impossible"" because it left me with a really bad taste in my mouth. The movie was a rather bitter pill to swallow.The movie did have a good cast, although I am no normally fond of Naomi Watts. But she did a good job in ""The Impossible"". And Evan McGregor is, of course, always great.Director J.A. Bayona played on some very cheap tricks in order to set up the audience, such as will the family see each other at the hospital even when they are within mere meters of each other.The visual effects in the movie were good and served their purpose quite well.All in all, this is a movie that tries to push the humane and emotional buttons of the audience.

The Impossible,"This movie was about the real survival story of a family vacationing in Thailand for Christmas. During this film a tsunami hit separating them. This movie showed their story as they search to be reunited with each other. This movie enraptured the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami that took over 200,000 lives in Phuket Thailand. With a wave height reaching fifty feet this was the biggest and deadliest tsunami to ever hit Thailand. In addition, there was a large number of tourists vacationing during this time adding to the death toll. This film accurately depicts the chaos and confusion after a natural disaster hits as well as the destruction it causes. There were thousands missing and more injured. This movie accurately depicts the massive undertaking of trying to provide medical aid, food, and water to all affected. However, it failed to show the warning signs of a tsunami. During this movie it appeared that there were no warning signs of any danger. In the event of a tsunami the water would have receded and tides would have been unpredictable. This was not shown in the film. Additionally, this tsunami was originally caused by a 9.1 magnitude earthquake. This was another warning sign that was missed in the film. However this earthquake happened in the deep ocean waters off the coast of Indonesia in addition to the sand absorbing the shock it is possible no one felt it occur. It did however depict the silence before a tsunami hits and how fast it hits. With speeds of around 200 miles an hour there was no time to react and this was depicted in the movie. Overall this film accurately portrays the aftermath of a tsunami. It caused a large amount of death as well as showing the damage it caused. Phuket was completely devastated by this event and caused many long-term effects in both the environment, farmlands, and the tourist industry. During this event many countries suffered significant death tolls as well as economic losses.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Touching and powerful occasionally but a little flat overall,"It starts off as a movie with a disaster waiting to happen just as advertised showing off happy moments, family bonds and future expectations just enough to ensure when the disaster hits, it hits hard. It did hit hard. If you forgive the occasional pacing issues and consistent coincidences (being a true story it is nothing short of miraculous), the actors will leave you with a feeling of unease with their brilliant natural and touching performances. The tsunami scene was quick, short, devastating and mostly well executed. Naomi Watts deserves a special applause along with the kid who played Lucas.Maria (Naomi Watts) and Henry (Ewan McGregor) are moderately happy couple who comes down to Thailand for a vacation with their 3 sons Lucas, Thomas and Simon. Just when the holiday mood kicks in the disaster strikes without a warning. With utmost perseverance and love for life Maria and Lucas endure themselves to safety badly beaten, scarred but not broken. On the other side, Henry is in search of his family. How their unbroken spirit and persistence help them to find each other constitutes the rest of the story.The scene where Maria is stuck in a frenetic underwater current makes you look away but could have been done a lot better. It was also difficult to watch with my ardent fear of water. If not for a true story credit, the near misses and the way the family finally reunite looks a bit undercooked. Naomi Watts shoulders the first half of the movie but Tom Holland (Lucas) steals the show for a short while by portraying a kind, confident yet vulnerable character. Runtime could be edited by a good 20 minutes and the melodrama and over emphasis of the power of human spirit (though apt in this instance) was a bit too much. Background score does not leave a mark and nor does the Thai locals performance.Touching and powerful occasionally but a little flat overall.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Direction,"The story line was good, but the cinema photography was awful and almost unwatchable at times. Not sure why a director thinks constant close ups makes for a good movie. The close ups become distracting and the constant moving between people's faces make the picture seem shaky. Secondly the close ups take away from the bigger picture of what is happening. The acting seemed realistic and even with the photographic shortfall gave you a good sense of what the catastrophe must have been like. The hospital scenes provided a real depiction of what it must be like in Thailand. The kids did a great job and really conveyed they were a family. Save for the photography this could of been a great movie.",6.0,Anonymous,History
The Impossible  A real story of courage and belief,"The true mettle of a person is tested during Impossible times and that is when the Impossible happens.The Impossible is a true story of a family of five who were at a beach resort in Thailand during the Christmas of 2004, when the dreadful Tsunami struck the Indian Ocean. We have all heard about it but the movie reinforces the fact that Mother Nature's wrath is something no man or man-made property can withstand. What we tend to take for granted in our everyday lives can be taken away from us in a whisk of a second.Excellent direction by Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat in a heart wrenching story, which is told in a seemingly simple way without any frills or complications of commercial cinema. The Tsunami scenes are well shot but not over the top, keeping the focus on the various emotions of the characters. Through the characters we experience, love, joy, fear, pessimism, optimism, sadness and humanity.Naomi Watts delivers an impactful and hard hitting performance as the mother of the kids. Her emotive eyes take you on a emotional roller- coaster. The surprise package and for me the star of the movie is young actor Tom Holland who plays the role of the eldest son and stays by the side of his mother through dangerous and emotional times. A scene in the movie when his mother's top comes off and she is oblivious of it speaks volumes of this actor's acting prowess without speaking a word. Ewan McGregor as the father is very expressive and believable. The character get's under your skin and makes you ponder what would you as father do when totally helpless against a force much stronger than anything.Without divulging the plot much, I highly recommend this movie. This is one of those movies which will keep you riveted throughout the screening and make you feel what the characters feel.At the end of it you do believe that belief does make the impossible, possible.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Casey's Movie Mania: THE IMPOSSIBLE (2012),"Word of warning: this is not a Roland Emmerich-kind of disaster movie (e.g. 2004's THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW and 2009's 2012) where larger-than-life special effects matters the most. Instead, THE IMPOSSIBLE is a rarity -- Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona (2007's THE ORPHANAGE) has created an emotionally-driven disaster movie that successfully captures the devastating effect of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami as well as the aftermath of how a significant family struggles to stay alive. It's a remarkable piece of filmmaking, and certainly not for the squeamish.The title is actually refers to the real-life Belon family, in which they vacationed in Thailand on December 2004 and miraculously survived one of the deadliest tsunamis in the history. In this movie, we are introduced to British-born businessman Henry Bennett (Ewan McGregor) and his doctor wife, Maria (Naomi Watts) along with their three boys, Lucas (Tom Holland), Thomas (Samuel Joslin) and Simon (Oaklee Pendergast). They arrive at a beautiful beach resort in Khao, Thailand on Christmas Eve. They spend wonderful times together, and things are going great on Christmas Day as well. But on the fateful December 26, they are surprised to discover a sudden Indian Ocean tsunami approaches without warning when they are lounging by the pool. Nevertheless the raging tsunami hits everything in its path and thus separating the family apart.After the tsunami subsides, Maria and her oldest son Lucas are trying to find their way to a safety place before they gradually getting help by local villagers and send to a nearest hospital. Meanwhile, Henry is together with Thomas and Simon somewhere within the ruins of the beach resort.With a seamless mix of special effects and real water surges created in a water tank in Spain, the particular 10-minute reconstruction of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami sequence is vividly realized with such captivating effect it truly makes my heart pound. Not only that, the effect feels so alarmingly real as if you are there witnessing the harrowing event. It is no doubt the most convincing tsunami effect I've ever seen. A special credit goes to Bayona who is certainly has a deft touch handling such tremendous visual impact.Other than that, Bayona is also adept on tugging our heartstrings. Blessed with a powerful script by Sergio G. Sanchez, its everlasting theme of family survival is well-handled here, even though the emotional values are tend to be amplified for the sake of dramatic purpose. Unlike most disaster movie, Sanchez made a smart decision not to focus on too many subplots with multiple characters from all angle. Instead, he strips down to the utmost important core to keep us focused on certain individuals. The result is somewhat intensely personal as we follow the Bennett family from start to finish.The cast are similarly first-rate. Naomi Watts is as excellent as always while Ewan McGregor gives one of his best performances in recent years. His scene involving a phone call back home is certainly heartbreaking. In his live-action big screen debut, Tom Holland delivers a remarkable performance as Lucas.Technical credits are all pitch-perfect, except for Fernando Velazquez's score which tends to get overwhelmed. Sound effects are meticulously detailed, especially the one involving the tsunami sequence.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A decently directed true story family drama,"There isn't much to be said about the plot in this movie, because, mainly, there is none. Which is, of course, to be expected. The main event here is the devastating natural disaster which we all, sadly, still remember, especially all the countless families that were affected by it, either by losing their loved ones or participating in it themselves, which has without doubt changed their lives forever. This is a story about one such family.The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was, in fact, one of the worst natural disasters in the recorded history, killing over 230,000 people. I remember watching the TV reports, I still feel shiver just thinking about it. I guess I cannot even begin to imagine what horrors families like this went through during the fore-mentioned events. And I am quite sure no movie can ever express those horrors thoroughly enough.I think this movie was done cleverly and with much precaution. The tsunami aftermath is still a very delicate subject, and there are a lot of people that witnessed this nature's act of destruction one way or another, so the filmmakers obviously didn't want to make it too realistic and documentary, instead they tended to focus on a single family's struggle for survival, with just the right amount of drama. The TV reports that I recall of were much more horrifying than the movie, but I guess it is better without too many explicit scenes.Speaking of explicitness, there is a small detail that I can't see the relevance of - showing Naomi Watts' naked breasts in a few scenes of the movie - but I guess the filmmakers had their reasons for this.The definitely most terrifying scenes in the movie were when and right after the wave struck, which was quite a good impression of nature's devastating whims. The effects in the movie were quite satisfactory. Though I must say I expected a longer introduction before the actual strike scene, i.e. some shots of the water recession. Not that it is of much relevance anyway, I just think it would have been a nice touch.To sum it up, there are some things that could have been done differently in this movie, nevertheless, it is a good, professionally directed, natural disaster movie, with good cast and some nice special effects, plentiful of drama, all in all qualities that make it's watching worthwhile.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Powerful and Heart-Shattering Performances,"Frankly, I had been experiencing some obvious pains while watching thiz movie. The movie gives you an actual situation of one of the deadliest natural disasters of the 21st century. It was the mega tsunami that hit most of Southeast Asia in 2004. To be more specific, it's based on the incredible true story of the Belon family consists of a father, a mother and three sons, which at that time were on vacation in Phuket, Thailand. The father Henry is played by Ewan McGregor. McGregor's character went through a lot of struggles to find his wife and son. It's a very complex character. However, he can translate thiz character pretty well. But personally, for me, it's the mother Maria who is played by Naomi Watts that delivers some powerful and heart-shattering performances. Watts can bring her character to life, with great emotional depth and effective improvisation. The other strong performance comes from the role of the eldest son Lucas which is played by Tom Holland. Holland creates a brilliant chemistry with Naomi Watts. The other two younger brother Thomas and Simon are played by Samuel Joslin and Oaklee Pendergast. Thiz movie is directed by young Spanish Director Juan Antonio Bayona who previously known for ""The Orphanage"" (2007). I can guarantee you will be in awe for the first 45 minutes of the movie, but after that, the storyline seems kind of lost. In addition to the impressive performances from the Cast members, thiz movie also provides breathtaking Visual Effects. It directly drags you into the middle of the situation. The giant tidal wave is frightening and believable. The sound of how tsunami debris hit and tear up the body is even more terrifying. There is always a meaning behind every tragedy. I appreciate the moral values in thiz movie. There is a scene, when the mother Maria tells her eldest son Lucas to help other victims though they themselves are in distress. It is praiseworthy deed and so amazing to see humanity is still alive. It's true, nothing is more powerful than the human spirit. That's the time when the impossible become possible.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,History

Hats off to the director for dealing with the subject so sensitively and yet making it to the detailed level and what actually really happened on that unfateful day. The Tsunami attack was executed properly though the length could have been extended( The best Tsunami attack was captured in Hereafter). However, this movie tells aftermath of Tsunami attack. The scenes shot in the hospital and the chemistry between mother( Naomi Watts) and son(Tom Holland) is the highlight of the film. The screenplay will keep you intact. Editing is good. Cinematography was good but not great. I like the last scene where Naomi Watts was thinking about the underwater incident while actually getting operated. Story is well-written and captured on silver screen. Naomi has given her finest performance and shares a great on screen chemistry with Tom Holland. Both of them haven given stupendous performances.

My Red Ball's Big Adventure,"A family of Japanese acrobats are touring Thailand during the holidays when a tidal wave hits right in the middle of a boxing match. One child's red ball goes through a harrowing experience in the aftermath - talk about getting kicked while your down! - while a Swedish cherub sits in a tree in the oddest advertisement for cola I have ever seen.Not sure why the Japanese people spoke with British accents, and then my monkey tried to tell me they were actually Spanish! I was baffled by their complete disregard for foot care walking around barefoot the whole time.Let me tell you though, me and monkey were completely transfixed, and I'm not going to lie, we cried a little. This will be a big hit in Lima, I'm sure, the whole crowd was gasping and blubbering the whole time. It's about time someone was brave enough to depict the horrors of going through life as a red ball in the East where they are treated like garbage. Red balls in the West should be very thankful. And what a beautiful reminder this film is of that.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Terrific spectacle and decent drama,"There is something a little unsavory about following one privileged white family through the hellish aftermath of the Indian Ocean Tsunami, but there's more than enough good material to counter any feelings of whitewashing. The recreation of the tsunami is a marvel of visual effects, combining miniatures and digital elements that must have been grueling to film and the result is a technical masterstroke. Its spectacle is both stunning and frightening and director Juan Antonio Bayona stages this mayhem with a brilliant eye. He holds shots without cutting quickly and even with his characters being tossed around from the water, the action is made of well composed shots that are never difficult to tell what is happening.Watts spends most of the film on a bed rotting, but manages to pull out a great performance, where she could have easily over done it and hammed it up. Newcomer Tom Holland (no, not the horror director) also does a fantastic job as Watts' young son.The Impossible spends most of its running time in a hospital, as tourists and locals search and mourn for their loved ones and while the film occasionally enters 'inspirational' territory, it never goes too far to become cloying and sentimental. There's enough quality filmmaking here to highly recommend The Impossible.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Mediocre,"The Impossible is visually very good: appealing photography, great special effects, good overall cinematography. And that is all one will remember about this movie, because it obviously lacks ambition and a strong script.Everything unfolds very (too) linearly and Bayona served up every cliché of the genre in a badly, clumsy manner: emphatic shots, slow motions, omnipresent violins... too much pathos kills. The director may be Spanish but it seems the movie comes straight out of the Hollywood emotions factory. Moreover, the dialogues seem bland and for the most part not that well written, one may even begin to question their credibility. The movie also looses a lot of dynamism after the hour mark, it then becomes very, very long until the final -and predictable- outcome.Disappointing.",4.0,Anonymous,History

The real disaster proceeds the wave,"We've had our share of ""torture porn."" Now, we've evidently entered the age of ""disaster/survival porn."" And, although the latter is far more hopeful, less sadistic, and infinitely better Oscar bait (you're welcome, Leo), they have more in common than you'd think. And J.A. Bayona's The Impossible is all we need by way of explanation: a humbling, powerful story of tragedy and resilience transmuted into such tastelessly exploitative Hollywood schlock that the real feeling of survival comes from making it all the way through to the end credits.The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was particularly horrific insofar as it was so unexpected, but it's a quality rarely evident in Bayona's account of it. Things start promising, as the initial scenes of inane banter of our posh family on Christmas vacation in Thailand are inoffensively credible, pleasant with just the right whiff of foreboding. Just when we start to let our guard down, we're blindsided by a tsunami that's as terrifyingly stunning a cinematic set piece as we could imagine. In terms of disaster spectacle, The Impossible excels, blending flawless CGI and practical effects to capture the horror of the wall of water and devastation it unleashed in a gruesomely engrossing fashion, shot so abruptly and breathlessly that it's wholly immersive, and bereft of distracting Hollywood affectations. The terror of the tsunami contrasting with the beauty of the panoramic Thailand scenery is poignant in itself, as the serenity of the beachside landscapes are strewn with fastidiously recreated apocalyptic wreckage and debris. Taken as a short film chronicling the experience of the tsunami itself, The Impossible is excellent.But this isn't enough. At the risk of clumsy non-sequitur, the only thing dancing through my head as The Impossible unfolded was Michael Caine in The Prestige musing ""It isn't enough to make something vanish; you have to bring it back,"" and how inappropriate such a Hollywood anthem can feel superimposed onto real tragedy. Granted, the real life story of the Álvarez/Belón family surviving and reuniting throughout the disaster is astonishing and inspiring, but it's done a disservice here, warped by dubious Hollywood social politics and gruesome emotional manhandling. Focusing on a single privileged white family over all the Thai locals (let alone the asinine recasting of the original Spanish source family) who were largely more ravaged and destroyed by the tsunami sits uncomfortably, and makes the film's increasingly broad scrabbling for a 'feel-good ending' distressingly tone-deaf.""Based on a true story"" nullifies spoilers, so we know all five members of the central family are going to survive, and Bayona contriving cumbersome sequences of 'how will they find each other?!?' dramatic irony amidst a backdrop of all the broken families, Thai and tourist alike, who haven't been so lucky, grates increasingly. Fernando Velázquez's cloying musical score only makes it worse. There is some solace in some of the hopeful beats amidst the refugee medical evacuation procedure which breathe more genuinely (it's nigh impossible - ha - to repress a deluge of smiles witnessing Tom Holland reuniting separated survivor families in the hospital). Still, Bayona climaxing with a sequence of Naomi Watts' protagonist reliving a flashback fetishizing each individual debris wound while caught in the tsunami before clawing her way up to the surface in agonizing slow-mo, is so idiotically offensive and grossly manipulative that we have to continually remind ourselves that it's through no fault of Watts' work or her real-life equivalent that we'd almost rather she just stay under the water here.The cast, to their credit, are superbly committed to conveying the agony of their nightmarish scenario, even if most of their dialogue is calling out each other's names. Watts conveys the weight of her torment remarkably convincingly, while wisely weaving in subtle notes of irritable humour throughout, which helps stave off us getting tired of her howling and whimpering in pain for an hour and a half straight (she could have given a useful note or two to Leo in The Revenant in this regard). Ewan McGregor is as charismatic as ever, but he shoulders the worst of the film's melodramatic suffering and operatic screaming, and grows tiresome very quickly, particularly when his character makes the jaw-dropping decision to abandon two of his young sons to look for his wife and son #3. As such, it's 'soon- to-be-Spider-Man' Tom Holland who walks away with the show here. Embodying battered, weary resilience stupendously in his slight, springy frame, whether he's belligerently yelling at his mother to stop vomiting blood or breaking into an irrepressible grin at seeing other families reunited, there's never a moment he's not viscerally believable. He's the spark of life and hope that keeps the film afloat, and we miss him desperately when he's not on screen.While The Impossible has its moments, thanks largely to the power of its big- budget tsunami recreation and strong work from Watts and Holland, it's mostly useful as an illustration of Hollywood's general inability to appropriately do justice to events of large scale tragedy and suffering beyond the sensory onslaught of the spectacle itself. 2009's Tsunami: Caught On Camera tells the same story through compiled found footage and interviews with survivors, and captures the devastation and inspiration of the disaster and those who survived it in a far more honest fashion. Unless you're a CGI buff, or keen fan of the cast (or just scoping out a pre-Civil War Spider-Man), see that instead.-6/10",6.0,Anonymous,History
'Nothing is more powerful than the human spirit.',"There are times when it takes the making visual of the devastation that occurs in nature to drive home the need for our being more aware of the suffering of our fellowmen at the hands of natural disasters around the world. Certainly THE IMPOSSIBLE achieves that. On December 26, 2004 one of the most disastrous tsunamis in history devastated portions of Thailand, killing thousands of people and destroying the landscape and lives of many more. This is the story of a Spanish family living in Japan but vacationing in Thailand and how they coped and survived this impossible natural act. Of note the entire crew that made this film is from Spain, the original title of the film is LO Impossible: María Belón shared her story which was transformed into a screenplay by Sergio G. Sánchez and the direction is by Juan Antonio Bayona. The cinematography is by Óscar Faura and the deeply moving musical score was written by Fernando Velázquez. For the film the family of note is British in origin but even their British background is secondary to the omni-national impact of the story.A regular family - Maria (Naomi Watts), Henry (Ewan McGregor) and their three children Lucas (a brilliant performance by Tom Holland), Simon (Oaklee Pendergast) and Thomas (Samuel Joslin) - travel to Thailand to spend Christmas in a villa on the coastline. After settling in and exchanging gifts, they go to the pool, like so many other tourists. A perfect paradise vacation until a distant noise becomes a roar. There is no time to escape from the tsunami; Maria and Lucas are swept in one direction, Henry, Thomas and Simon in another. Once the storm settles the story is the strength of character and of family and of love that is able to overcome the impossible odds that they will ever be united.The cast of the family is excellent but there are also very fine cameo roles by Sönke Möhring who plays another father desperately seeking his lost family, Geraldine Chaplin as an old woman who comforts the boys, and many others who move in and out of the story quickly. The film approaches two hours in length and in the mid portion it becomes repetitive and in need of some editing. But in ways this adds to the incredible sense of tolerance and survival of the characters. The surprise of the film, once the emotional impact begins to subside, is the brilliance of the acting of Tom Holland as Lucas, the oldest son who has inherited his mother's medical acumen and is able to help everyone around him. Watch for his career to ascend.Grady Harp",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Although certainly not perfect, it's a movie worth watching.","Review posted originally on InspirationRation.com - Last night I went to the advanced screening of The Impossible starring Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor.First of all, if you're planning to go see this movie and haven't seen the trailer, be sure not to see it. I think it's a perfect example of a trailer that reveals too much of the movie. There is even a part that has to come as a surprise, but when you've seen the trailer (or even some of the movie posters) it isn't, and you were just waiting for it.The movie is about a happy family who spent their Christmas Holiday at the shores of Thailand in 2004. Indeed, the year the tsunami hit The movie starts with an eerie sound, a sound that sets the feeling for this movie perfectly. The first fifteen minutes the movie is building up to what we all know will happen, the tsunami. The moment where this happens is a great scene. The filmmakers did this very well, by using one powerful thing: Sound. By not using a song or sad melody but just using the sound of the powerful, powerful water it is as if you are there! We all know how everything sounds when your head is under water, multiply it by 100, add some debris, a lot of panic and a rush of water and it feels immense. The sheer noise of roaring water. If you are going to see this movie, be sure to have an adequate sound system.After the severity of the tsunami itself subsides, begins the silence, the loneliness, the search. I think they showed this very well and you feel the brutal reality of it.About an hour into the movie things start to go downhill. At some point I got annoyed by the plot becoming too forced and the cheesy American-movie-things happen. The near-misses, the doubtful choices of the characters and the illogical things. They (try to) make the movie more dramatic than it needs to be. This is unnecessary because the whole tsunami-thing and aftermath IS dramatic enough. Sure, maybe only because it happened for real, but if it didn't happen for real there probably wasn't a movie like this.The main characters are the family, where especially the kids are great in the movie. Aside from the fact that they are cute they're also good actors and it's the children who manage getting you watery eyed now and then.Funny detail; at a given moment there are people of different nationalities who say something. Among them there is a Dutch woman, and surprisingly (contrary to what often happens) I could understand what she said in Dutch. I think it's great that they cast a Dutch person even for one sentence in the movie. I don't know how it is with the other nationalities (my Swedish isn't great ;-) ), but it was a welcome surprise.It wasn't a great movie, but there are plenty of moments the theatre was dead silent and no one dared to make any noise, not a single bag of crisps was crackling and even breathing stopped for a moment. Especially in the first hour you are drawn into the movie and the fact it is (based on) a real story adds to its power. The second half of the movie wasn't the greatest, but nonetheless I think it's a movie worth watching. - Review posted originally on InspirationRation.com",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Has a gritty sense of realism about it, but not everything works here","The Impossible tells the true story of a tsunami that hit Thailand back in December 2004 and focuses on one family trying to survive in the aftermath of one of the deadliest natural disasters ever recorded.As The Impossible has an events-driven style narrative it's fair to say that it is fast-moving and is never dull. In its early stages you're not quite sure if everyone has survived, if they have how bad are their injuries and how they will manage to find one another... All of these things are good hooks in helping to maintain an interest in what is happening.The film also has a gritty sense of realism about it as well; it's well-made and when watching it it's very easy to become absorbed in the action and feel the pain and suffering of those that were there. Many of the extras were survivors of the actual event and I sense that, at least some of them may have had a hand in how this film was made and how the story was told as it does have a polished well put together feel about it.The acting is also very good with Naomi Watts being the standout (though in fairness she was given a far more meaty role). Ewan McGregor (despite being given less to do) also impresses as does Tom Holland in what may well have been his acting debut.The only slight downside with a film like The Impossible, at least as far as I'm concerned, lay with the characters themselves. The writers seem to keep them at arms length (not a great deal is learned about them) and whilst I had every sympathy for their plight I felt somewhat distanced from them; perhaps more character development would have fixed this issue.Despite my slight objection above, The Impossible is a film that's well worth seeing; the gritty realism and events-driven approach combine well and really throw the viewer into the horrible events that occurred on that fateful day.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Missing panic and chaos,"I'll start with some good things I have to say. Tom Holland is absolutely brilliant here, Naomi Watts is quite good. Cinematography is ok. And that's about it.This movie is very quiet. No sense of urgency that we would expect from victims of such a big disaster. Some scenes are just empty and too ,,clean,,. It is closely focused on one family and it feels like there are not other half a million people screaming and calling out their loved ones. It's quite unbelievable and dramatic for the tearjerk effect, but without any real urgency. It feels that only this family matters.I don't like to leave low reviews on movies, because I do have appreciation for people who came together and made this movie. But they did it in a bit lazy and tone down way.",5.0,Anonymous,History
An emotional journey,"I don't usually shed tears when watching a movie because I know it's just fake and everything is acting. But... this movie is just different...

Really enjoyed watching her putting so much effort into this movie. Without it, I really doubt this movie could be so successful.There's also Tom Holland, a new actor. He is a very talented young actor and definitely has a bright future in this industry. Tom and Naomi really did an amazing job together.Juan Antonio Bayona also did a good job in making the film so real. When watching this, I kept asking myself ""is this real or CGI?"" It's just amazing! The film also shows everybody's part of the story which makes us feel closer to them.In conclusion, if this doesn't get awards, then I don't know what can.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Best docu-drama since THE PERFECT STORM,"After last week's LIFE OF PI, another film that relies for its impact on spectacular Special Effects. Based on the true story of a Spanish family who miraculously survived the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami which killed over 200,000 people, THE IMPOSSIBLE makes them an English family, the Bennetts, who are in and around the swimming pool of their beach-side hotel on a Thai island when the great wave hits.The film has been criticised for concentrating on the fate of one white family when so many (mostly non-white ) people died in the disaster, but the director gives us glimpses of others caught up in this terrible event (some, we are told, played by people who were really there). And the dramatic focus on the Bennetts gives the viewer a sense of involvement: this could have been ME - and MY FAMILY. There are a couple of moments when the script seems to produce too many coincidences, and some of the scenes are unashamedly manipulative - tears are literally jerked out of the viewer.The film's 114 minutes fairly fly by. The family is very easy to ""identify with"". Naomi Watts and Tom Holland give vividly believable performances. The moment when the tsunami hits the resort has the most awesome impact since the sonically-induced disturbances in creaky old EARTHQUAKE (1974). This is the most exciting and most persuasive 'docu- drama' since THE PERFECT STORM. It's kind of awful to admit this, but I really enjoyed being taken back to the tsunami!",8.0,Anonymous,History
The Impossible: A Gripping and Emotionally Resonant Portrait of Tragedy and Resilience,"In the realm of disaster films, ""The Impossible"" stands out as a powerful and emotionally resonant cinematic experience that captures the raw devastation of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the indomitable spirit of humanity in the face of unimaginable adversity.The film's initial appeal lies in its unflinching depiction of the tsunami's catastrophic impact, transporting viewers to the heart of the disaster and immersing them in the chaos, destruction, and loss of life. The film's realism is palpable, creating a sense of immediacy and urgency that makes the events feel all the more real.Amidst the heart-wrenching scenes of destruction and despair, ""The Impossible"" finds moments of profound hope and humanity. The film beautifully portrays the unbreakable bonds of family, the resilience of the human spirit, and the compassion of strangers in the face of unimaginable adversity. These moments of hope provide a counterbalance to the film's harrowing depiction of the disaster, offering a glimmer of light amidst the darkness.Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts deliver exceptional performances as the Álvarez parents, capturing the emotional turmoil and desperation of their characters with raw authenticity. Their portrayals are deeply moving and resonant, capturing the essence of their characters' fight for survival and their unwavering love for their children. Their performances are the heart and soul of the film, adding depth and emotional resonance to the story.Tom Holland, as Lucas, the Álvarez family's youngest son, delivers a remarkable performance that adds a layer of vulnerability and authenticity to the film's emotional impact. His portrayal of a child caught in the midst of a catastrophic disaster is both heartbreaking and inspiring. Holland's ability to convey the fear, confusion, and desperation of a young boy struggling to survive in a world turned upside down is truly exceptional.""The Impossible"" masterfully balances the harrowing reality of the disaster with glimmers of hope and humanity. It does not shy away from depicting the full extent of the tragedy, but it also finds moments of grace and compassion amidst the chaos. This balance allows the film to be both emotionally harrowing and ultimately uplifting.""The Impossible"" is a powerful and unforgettable cinematic experience that will stay with you long after the credits roll. It is a reminder of the strength of the human spirit in the face of adversity and the importance of family and love in times of crisis. The film's realism, emotional depth, and exceptional performances make it a must-watch for anyone seeking a gripping and thought-provoking cinematic experience.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Being that he was only 14, and this was his first film, so much of this movie leans on his ability to make you feel the fear, relief, trauma, desperation, and helplessness that Lucas must have felt.Truly worth the watch if you enjoy movies that are profound and nuanced, as this film has what would be called a ""happy ending"" on paper, but the humanity and duality of the emotions that come with surviving a disaster like the one the movie is recreating.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Washed away,"The Impossible is one of those man Vs nature stories but with the emotional layer of a family torn apart. The actors go out of their way to play their parts realistically. I thought Naomi Watts was fantastic as a mom struggling to cope with trauma and nearly teenage son. The young lad is also someone to watch out for. The art direction, an oft forgotten part of cinema, is fantastic. Can't even begin to imagine how much planning would have gone into making this film. A must watch just to comprehend some of the events post the tsunami and how people coped with it in their own way. The writing and direction are subtle and never fight for attention, just like how i like it. I guess the story lacks twists and turns and relies more drama and acting but that's not really the writer's fault since it is based on the true experiences of a family. Having been to Phuket in the years after the Tsunami its amazing to see how this city has got back on its feet and it makes this story even more personal to me.

A drama over a thriller,"If, like me, you've become accustomed to Hollywood's recent obsession with disaster movies, then you might have expected The Impossible to be more of a fast-paced, tension-driven thriller about people trying to survive against the elements. However, this is actually more of a thoughtful, uplifting piece. Yes, we have some special effects near the beginning where a huge tidal wave decimates a holiday resort in Thailand, leaving numerous dead or missing, but the rest of the film is about a family who have become separated with each other, undertaking the monumental task of trying to find each other again in the midst of the aftermath.With Ewan McGreggor and Naomi Watts as leads, you can expect decent performances, but the stand-out character who steals many of the scenes is the young boy who plays their son and shows how he was forced to cope with growing up far sooner than he ever should have.It's a good film, if you're looking for drama and a real story of survival against the odds. Just don't expect a roller-coaster of excitement with many thrills and spills along the way.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7.0,Anonymous,History
better than expected but...,"entering the movie I had so mixed emotions, excitement about the Director Juan Antonio Bayona next project, seeing 2 of my fav actors Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor while on the other hand, re living what the movie trailer revealed but in a longer version!that was what happened in most of the story, basically the trailer tolled me exactly what to expect from the movie; everything is focused about a white happy family and their survival story ignoring a disaster happened to more than 200 thousand if I am not mistaken! and while some passing scenes came across other characters or victims which happened to be white people as well!!!! on the other hand as the camera rolled at the native Thai people they seemed to be perfectly normal with no injuries or whatsoever as if they knew about what was coming!!! I am not sure what the director intend on this idea but that made no sense to me at all!! in some of the scenes it felt like the director was trying to distract the audience from noticing plot holes by taking them on a roller coaster ride of emotions and tears which -to be honest- was working most of time while I remained in need for further details or depth in exploring each of stories and characters portrayed here and there.that been said, I have to highlight some of the great stuff about the movie which were: Naomi Watts amazing and astonishing performance wither physical or emotional wise, the young talent Tom Holland, the soundtrack and the most amazing cinematography I have seen in a movie since along time.at the end I will not say I am disappointed with the movie as it was a bit better than what I was expecting but for sure I will be big time disappointed if Naomi was not the one who will take the Academy Award home this year",7.0,Anonymous,History
Underwhelming production of overwhelming tragedy,"I'm sorry, I understand this movie is based on the remarkable true story of a family's heroism in the wake of the devastating tsunami which hit Thailand (and other countries) on Boxing Day 2004, killing thousands, but I just wasn't moved by what I saw on the screen.Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts are barely together on screen long enough to project for the viewer any kind of meaningful relationship between them, their family of three young boys act stiltedly and unnaturally, while the dialogue is clichéd, ditto the dramatic sequences, the latter on innumerable occasions. The director isn't above cross-cutting between scenes at key moments for dramatic effect, a Hollywood M.O. from the year dot, but the manipulation here is so blatant and ham-fisted that the film somehow failed to draw me into the human drama here.The special effects for the tsunami and Watts and her oldest boy's subsequent odyssey in the aftermath of the disaster, I found only passable, at best while McGregor's acting in particular leaves a lot to be desired, being shallow and showy by turns. Watts has less to do, being wrapped up badly injured in a hospital bed for a large part of the running time, in fact any number of the extras were more watchable in my opinion.While I have nothing but admiration for the real-life family who somehow came through such a terrible ordeal, this formulaic, clichéd disaster movie didn't, I think, serve them well and rather ill-served its noble subject.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Tom Holland is the best in the film.,"It is the most emotional natural disaster film i have ever watched.there are so many scenes in the film which will make you cry, i have seen this movie many times and tears come to my eyes every time i watch those scenes .this film is packed with outstanding performances by Naomi watts,Tom Holland and Ewan McGregor but i must say Tom Holland is the best in the film.Naomi watts is nominated for the best actress in academy awards for this film and i think she should get the Oscar this time. but i would say that the film is more dramatic than realistic but still i cant deny the fact that the film is one of the best of 2012. 2004 hazardous natural disaster is well shown in the film and every actor have justified their character, Naomi's emotions never look fake and only a mature actor can do that what Naomi has done in the film and Tom at this age he acted like a matured actor although it's his first film. The Impossible, a must watch.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Powerful and emotional,"One of those movies that stay with you for a long time afterward. Wow. Solid performance from the whole cast, most of all Holland - who was, quite frankly, outstanding, and not only for his age. The presence of minor Swedish characters especially hit home for me, as there were so many swedes lost in this catastrophe and I've grown up hearing stories of people who went to Thailand and never came back. Honestly, this movie deserves an Oscar (if it hasn't already gotten one).",9.0,Anonymous,History
Tom Holland (way before Spiderman) proved he's an actor,"I had no idea Tom was in the movie when I started it, nor did I realize what a big role he played. His acting was better than many adults, and I cried and cringed all the way through this movie. His fear at thinking his whole family was dead and then his utter relief at seeing them again still brings tears to my eyes. When the water rushes everyone away at the beginning, you don't see what Naomi's character, Marie, goes through. Not until the end, and I was on the edge of my seat. This movie is sad at points and tragic at others, but I breathed a giant sigh of relief as it ended. Such a well done movie and well worth the watch.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Wow!  I Was Pleasantly Surprised!,"I was expecting a typical 'movie of the week' type but this was anything but that. The first part was chilling and followed a family vacationing at a beach resort in Thailand for Christmas, unbeknownst to them a tsunami would slam into the place just one day after Christmas. Even though I knew about the tsunami of Thailand in 2004, this brought it to life. The second part was emotional! I have not cried this much at a movie since... I don't remember when. The children who acted in this move did a wonderful job of bringing this story to life! What talented actors!! This movie is based on a true story. At the movie's end, I don't believe there was a dry eye in the theater.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Harrowing and emotional experience,"After the tsunami hits in this true story, you really get a feel for the aftermath...I love the aesthetic of the holiday resort...it just looks really horrible and the cast and extras look suitably ragged. The special effects and effects are just great. In Hollywood movies when you saw a tsunami, it would be towering over a skyscraper, which just looked incredible. Seeing the news footage of the tsunami at the time, it was a different kettle of fish, but no less bleak. ""The impossible"" really captures that moment and what happens afterwards.In one of the news stories I read about the even, it was mentioned that tourists on the beach noticed how far the tide was out before the tsunami hit. That strikes me as being invaluable information, turning a ""That's weird!"" observation into - hopefully - a realisation that you need to run to the hills, so to speak, to save your life. However, this bit of crucial information is not mentioned in the movie, which I do feel was a pity...it could have been introduced somehow.Anyway, this movie is about one family's (the Bennetts) experiences of the tsunami and the aftermath...not knowing if they would live through the initial surge, worrying about further surges, and wondering if/how many of their immediate family have died in the initial surge.There are many scenes which establish how nice and good this family but the worth of this movie is in how raw emotion moves you. Naomi Watts as Maria, the mother of 3 young boys does just that, and is deserving of her acting award nominations. The moments where she does make you feel her agony deserves recognition...perhaps even winning any such awards. Ewan McGregor as Henry, the father also has one powerful scene. The one bum note in this move for me was where Henry came across as the 'star' of the movie, instead of just being someone in the same boat as everyone else...I mean how the non-central characters got involved in his story. It just rang false to me...because his plight was no more or less important than anyone else's. Tom Holland has the eldest Bennett boy also has some very good scenes where he powerfully conveys emotion. I'm not sure that the performances are of a consistently high quality, but when they hit those heights, Naomi, Ewan and Tom certainly deserve recognition for their acting. They truly moved me.This movie is a good candidate for recognition in the fields of acting and special effects and effects, costume and the like. There are some scenes of injuries suffered in the tsunami which are definitely not for the squeamish though.Have noticed at least one professional reviewer mark the movie down for substituting a white, Anglo family for the Spanish family this movie was based on. That seems really pedantic to me. The credits to demonstrate a very big Spanish role in the making of this movie, so it looks like a conscious decision to maximise the audience for the story in the West, and a photo of the actual family is shown at the end.If I was to quibble, the start of the movie emphasises the ""true story"" aspect of this movie whilst it does have some very Hollywood like coincidences which didn't seem plausible. Maybe such coincidences did actually happen to the family, but in the movie it just seemed contrived...but not in a way which devalued the experience.The end credits lists ""tea boys"" in the crew...that must be a first, surely? Pity I missed the person who ""always says...""...not sure if that was sourced from the original family or not...they do get mentioned a bit.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Emotionally stirring drama. Entertaining!,"The Impossible delivers what it promises; and movie goers can expect an intense, disaster film set against 2004′s Indian Ocean tsunami.This latest film by Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona (The Orphanage) is based on a real family and their harrowing experience while holidaying in Thailand. When violence struck the seaside region of Khao Lak on boxing day, all five individuals were separated and left to fend for themselves.Bayona spends half an hour introducing British family; the Bennetts, establishing relationship dynamics that effectively presage each member's survival instincts. Henry and Maria (Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts) are loving and middle-aged parents to privileged kids: eldest son Lucas (Tom Holland) is 12 and outlier of the group; second child Tom is 9½, thoughtful and sensitive with a soft spot for astronomy; youngest son Simon is 5, young and adorable apple of the eye.It's just another morning by the pool when cataclysmic destruction arrives and the first wall of wave smashes against the resort. Palm trees and structures collapse, tourists and locals are washed away. In one of the most riveting sequences of this film, we witness the violent assault Maria endures when submerged underwater--she is physically mutilated, crushed, knocked, twirled, punched, slashed by miles of debris before spotting Lucas. The second act begins with a frantic and painful race against time to safety before another wave hits.Pervasive atmosphere of this film is dank and risky, but the fact that Maria and Lucas are still alive shrouds unspeakable hope that their loved ones will live. In classic passion and ferocity so often evoked by Spanish cinema; we worry for these characters and despair at the brutal invasion of fragile life.With Maria teetering on the edge of fatal injury and the fates of Henry, Tom, Simon still unknown; Bayona successfully creates emotionally stirring drama. Brilliant performances by Watts and Holland will also bring tears to the soft-hearted.cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,History
A BEAUTIFUL VIEW OF DESTRUCTION ON DISPLAY...!,"Playing like an earlier cousin of The Wave, The Impossible follows a family's survival during a tsunami wave whilst on vacation. Boasting an early turn by future Spiderman Tom Holland, we see him hold his own against Ewan McGregor & Naomi Watts as he navigates his passage from needy, feckless youth to unabashed adult. J.A. Bayona, now holding the reins of the next Jurassic World flick, has a handle on making the epic intimate & the small grandiose. A welcome respite in a cinematic world which gives us tripe like San Andreas & most of Roland Emmerich's disaster output.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Natural-Disaster Movie Mission Accomplished!,"It is a mission impossible if I don't include puns in my movie reviews. And that is the case also in my review for the tsunami–themed film ""The Impossible"". One of the worst global catastrophes happened when I inadvertently put a ""new wave"" spin to movie reviews by pestering them with puns. OK, I am kidding, even though some of you might concur with that sentiment. In reality, one of the worst global catastrophes ever was the 2004 Thailand tsunami that killed more than 200,000 people. ""The Impossible"" is based on a true story of one family that miraculously survived the Thaliand tsunami disaster. Naomi Watts stars as the mother of the family named Maria; she is a doctor who visits Thailand for a Christmas vacation with her husband Henry and their three sons Lucas, Thomas, and Simon. Maria gets seriously injured in the tsunami and separates from Henry, Thomas, and Simon. Maria does find the eldest son Lucas in the rapid tsunami waters. Therefore, Lucas' mission is to get help for her profoundly injured mother; while Henry, Thomas, and Simon's mission is to find Maria and Lucas. Director Juan Antonio Bayona's impressive reenactment of the Thailand tsunami on film was quite a feat for this aspiring filmmaker. His directorial future is nowhere close to being a disaster. Now, I did have some minor complaints with Sergio Sanchez' screenplay; even though it proficiently verbalized the power of the human spirit, it was lacking a bit of character development, so I was not entirely swept away with Sanchez' scribe. Naomi Watts was outstanding in her Oscar-nominated leading performance as Maria. The underrated Ewan McGregor was also exceptional as Henry. And child actor Tom Holland is headed to Hollandwood, I mean Hollywood child stardom with his stirring performance as Lucas. What I found to be the most disastrous in the aftermath of ""The Impossible"" was the disheartening omission of a Best Production Design Oscar nomination for ""The Impossible""; I guess the ""old wave"" of geriatric Academy members did not catch the brilliance of Production Designer Eugenio Caballero's work in the movie. I do think ""The Impossible"" is an emotionally-charged movie that will make it impossible for you not to shed a watering tear. So make it possible to catch ""The Impossible"". **** Good",8.0,Anonymous,History
A horrific look at one of the biggest natural disasters in human history,"No matter how different people are from each other, there is always an event that seems to bring people together. Unfortunately, it is usually when something bad happens and such a thing happened on Christmas of 2004 in Southeast Asia when a Tsunami hit many countries in the area. One of the countries that was hit the hardest was Thailand and this movie clearly shows the devastation of the horrific event.The movie is about a family of 5 - two parents (Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor) and their three kids (one of whom is played by a young Tom Holland). They are vacationing in Thailand. They are having a wonderful Christmas when, all of a sudden, a tsunami hits the streets and literally destroys everything in its path, tearing the family apart.Before I get to the amazing performances - and indeed they are amazing - I must start off with the wave sequence itself. Everybody that was a part of this sequence deserves an Oscar for their stellar work. Although horrific, every aspect of it is beautifully done. We see people getting hit around by debris under water; we see people hanging on to fallen trees for dear life; we see people struggling to stay afloat amidst the roaring waves. J.A. Bayona has created a great sequence in a great movie and he really should have been recognized a lot more for this movie.That being said, it really is the performances that sell this movie more than anything. Naomi Watts gives one of the best performances of her career, earning the Oscar nomination for her part in the film. She spends about 2/3 of the film beaten, bruised and looking nothing like a Hollywood star, and you can really see the emotions that are going through her head. There's one particularly scene towards the end where she says something that will make your heart break. I won't say what it is, but you'll know when she says it. Ewan McGregor also gives an unbelievable performance; seriously, when is the Academy going to honor this man? He really deserved the Oscar nomination for Moulin Rouge and he deserved it here too. I really hope that he gets recognized someday because he really deserves it. However, the true star of the show here is future Spider-Man himself, Tom Holland. Even before he was saving people with his webslinging abilities, he was saving them with his compassion in this movie! He spends the movie helping a lot of people - whether it's his family or other families. When he sees the other families reuniting when his has not, you can really see the mixed feelings of joy and pain in his face. A mature actor who will one day get an Oscar.My one complaint about this movie: I wish that they had spent a bit more time on Ewan McGregor's character and the two younger boys. Once the wave hits, we spend a lot of time with Naomi Watts and Tom Holland, but there is a moment in which Ewan McGregor tells his little boys that he was the most scared when he saw that he was alone and then he saw his two little boys and that he wasn't scared anymore. That would have been such a great moment to see on film and it really would have made the movie even better in my opinion.All in all, a beautiful movie with superb performances all around. Definitely a great movie!",8.0,Anonymous,History
An amazing TRUE story,"Sometimes a film you can't wait too see can dispaoint you, and other times a film you think probably shouldn't off been made, can impress you. Fortunately ""The Impossible"" is the later. Perhaps its too early too be making movies about the 2004 Indian ocean tsunami. But ""The Impossible"" focuses on an amazing thing that happened during that horrible time. Its telling a happy story that happened during all the tragedy. Off how an entire family actually survived, and had to find each other amongst the rubble.I feel a bit overly generous giving ""The Impossible"" such a high rating, but I have to admit to it breaking me in a way that rarely happens. If your into your tearful movies you'll love it, if not, you probably shouldn't be reading this. As you'll have no interest in the movie at all. I'm not usually up for these sorts off things, but cant deny that I had a tear in my eye way more than once throughout. Maybe that's because its a true story, and its about a family. Not some soppy ""twilight"" style romance.""The Impossible"" doesn't exploit what happened only 8 years ago. It merely shows us something that happened during that time. There are no sickening, disrespectful CGI shots off giant waves (That would off been awful!) We See off the disaster what the leading characters saw, and they are played brilliantly here by Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts, as well as some great child actors (Again, something I'm not usually impressed by).",10.0,Anonymous,History
Realistic to the point of scary,"I was not feeling well about going to see that movie since i have real life memories about the 2004 tsunami. I was afraid it would trigger bad memories. Actually had to jump over piles of dead bodies and debris to go to a safe place with my Mum and Dad after the second wave hit Galle, Sri Lanka were we were that day. Its the city next to were that train ironically called the Queen of the Sea got hit by the tsunami. The largest single rail disaster in world history by death toll, with probably 1,700 fatalities or more.But after few years i developed a backbone and finally watched it. I saw the tsunami in 2004 in the eyes of 11 year old child and again through this exceptional movie as an adult. I remember the very first thing that come to my mind when i heard 30 feet high wave was coming towards us was 'DAY AFTER TOMORROW', the disaster movie i saw only months before. Though not as high budgeted or green screen as that movie this movie covers the part were it shows how people act in a situation like this. Luckily i didn't see the wave as we were already at an upper floor of a shopping mall. But i definitely saw the aftermath.Lot of children and parents got separated by the wave.MY aunt and uncle were at the car park near the mall and we had no idea what happened to them. My parents had to check camps and then hospital morgues.( which could not handle all the bodies as there were too many so they had to arrange them in hallways and cafeterias and everywhere so the relatives can come and identify them) But they were okay and i remember how happy i was when i saw them alive after two days.Really saw best of humanity and how a brought everyone together. How people helped each other.I have to say the movie directors have taken some risk bringing an incident that still rather new in people's minds in to screen but they've handled it very well. Better disaster movie than 2012 in my opinion.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"Emotional Tear Power Promised in ""The Impossible"".","Well written and acted film. Personally, I appreciated Ewan MacGregor's performance more so than Naomi Watts...who follows the same style of acting as in many of her previous films -- seeming to be a serene bystander, escalating to apprehension; then askance! Horror! Exploding into her legendary screaming skills or well, lack of control.Certainly not worthy of an Oscar nod, particularly since this mode is her norm in most films to date. It just doesn't rise to the same caliber of acting of Meryl Streep or Sally Field's abilities to invent diverse characters and moods in every film. One doesn't know WHAT may happen with them in the role; one can safely guess with Watts.However, the film which retells the true story of a family's horrendous ordeal experiencing and enduring the terror of the catastrophic tsunami in Thailand of 2004 has a lot of emotional punch to it. Helping the script along is the astounding cinematography depictions of activity UNDER the water and in it! Truly -- well, real!

A must watch movie that will make you appreciate for every single tomorrow of your life!,"The story behind the Tsunami of 2004 that took South East Asia by surprise and left her weeping, helpless and angry will never be forgotten. Boxing Day will never be the same again for those families and their relatives who were devoured by the angry waters of the Indian Ocean that morning. To reenact that day in history and to bring to life a story of such mega catastrophic proportions is considered both foolish and wise.37 year old Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona in my opinion delivers a balanced view of the carnage that took place that day and how it affected both the local and foreign alike. One of the most important issues he balances is the presentation of the suffering of the local islanders and the story line of a family on holiday that is caught in the middle of one of the largest natural disasters to be recorded in our history. He finds this balance in the powerful performances of Naomi Watts, Ewan McGregor and Tom Holland.Naomi Watts who was nominated for an Academy Award is indeed performing the role of her lifetime. Hands down she surpasses her previous nomination over a decade ago in 21 GRAMS and bedazzles me with her most heartfelt showcasing. Her characters persona undoubtedly is not only the cry of Maria Bennet; it is the plea of every single mother that saw her family wash away in front of their eyes. I know what this look feels like because on that day I saw that in my own mothers' eyes as the wave hit shores of Sri Lanka where I was travelling by. The only thing lacking in THE IMPOSSIBLE is the lack of screen time for Naomi Watts as her character restricts to be bed ridden with injuries.The desperate father who would stop at nothing and the 10 year old son who literally carries the weight of his mothers' pains moves the audience. Hollywood star McGregor and new to the widescreen Tom Holland are unbelievable. I would say again; they are unbelievable. Every minute spent in front of the screen is every minute lived in that moment. McGregor's versatility has never been a surprise to the movie enthusiast. He rarely misses what he is aiming for. Although with time I have realized that McGregor fails to rise beyond the others whilst performing brilliantly. This may be the only reason he is yet to be nominated for an Academy Award.Naomi Watts deserved the Award for Best Actress at the 85th Academy Awards way beyond Jennifer Lawrence and her irritating screaming performance. Ewan McGregor as always meets the expectations. However the actor to watch out for is Tom Holland. He takes on the emotional wand once Watts is bed ridden and he is the best performance I have seen in a young actor in 2012. (I am yet to watch BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD). Holland will not forget this debut motion picture and it's not wrong to assume that he was lucky to have been presented with such a well written character that allowed him to explore the depths of his abilities.THE IMPOSSIBLE is the story of family based on true events that is on holiday in Thailand at a resort Island when the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake triggered a series of devastating waves along the coastlines of the Indian Ocean. A sunny morning by the poolside with the family turns out to be worst day of their lives when they are swept away with gigantic muddy tsunami waves reaching over 30 meters in height. The CGI dominance will drown you in the reality of this horror whilst the script will resurface you to the light of tomorrow. If you have the patience you will be able to get a glimpse of the photo of the real family that narrates this story as the end credits roll up the screen.A must watch movie that will make you appreciate for every single tomorrow of your life!TITLE: THE IMPOSSIBLE DIRECTED BY: JUAN ANTONIO BAYONA STARRING: NAOMI WATTS, EWAN MCGREGOR & TOM Holland RATED: PG 13 RATING: 08/10 RUNTIME: 114 MINUTES",8.0,Anonymous,History

While all the story is focused on the lucky ones, the American wealthy family who did not lost anyone, but spend the whole movie crying and talking beautiful sentences, they end up flying to Singapore thanks to their insurance, to get a better care.
The movie suggest that the Thai people weren't taking a good care of the mother, and worse they made mistakes like switching identity with a dead person...

None Really,"I saw this for the first time last night and it had a terrible effect on me. Let me explain. My wife had been badgering me for years to visit India. She was born in Uganda to parents of Indian origin and had always wanted to visit her 'home' country. After many years I finally agreed and duly we booked a two week holiday with our children (14 and 20 at the time) in Kerala in a hotel a few miles north of Kovalam. The flight was awful but I kept thinking of the idyllic time we would spend on the beach. On our second or third day we booked a three day trip to visit the backwaters and the hills (Periyar) and set off three days before Christmas day. After a good trip we arrived back at the hotel late on Christmas Day. My wife said that we would get up early the next day to visit the sacred Hindu site of Kanyakumari. We woke up well after 8am the next morning and my wife said that she was exhausted from our previous trip. Perhaps we should just go down and have a leisurely breakfast and then lounge by the pool. I agreed and so did the 'kids'. We ended up by the pool, a stone's throw from the sea at about 9.30. It was hot and after a while my wife said she would go and get some cold drinks after a wander along the beach. About fifteen minutes later she came back and said 'Have you heard the news ? There's been a tsunami and people have had to be pulled from the water'. A thousand questions followed 'Where, when, should we move ?'. I was sceptical. We would have been dead if a tsunami had hit. News filtered in, in dribs and drabs and slowly the immensity of the catastrophe began to sink in. We were prevented from going onto the beach and the stories began to circulate about how tide had gone out for a long way at Kovalam beach and the police had had to order people off the beach. Later that night we walked along the part of the hotel where it met the beach and two old ladies that we had become acquainted with were sitting sipping G&Ts. We asked what they had done that day and had they heard the news? Yes, they had been on their way to Kanyakumari and their taxi had broken down. When they arrived, they were in a line of hundreds queuing for the boats to take them across to them temple. They witnessed first hand the immense waves sweep hundreds to their deaths and the shock, no traumatized, onlookers realizing that their loved ones had been killed. large families had been split up due to the numbers able to be taken at a time by the boats. The next day I spoke to a honeymoon couple who were on a 'safari', on their way down to beach when the lead vehicle had spotted something wrong and had had the presence of mind to turn the convoy around, thus saving many lives. What impacted me the most was the randomness of the event. Some were killed yet some were spared. Two hundred had died in the backwaters where we had been to on the previous trip and fifteen hundred plus had been at Kanyakumari on that terrible day. Mothers, Fathers, sisters, brothers and so on had died that day and yet we had not even noticed the event on our beach or in our hotel. For several years after, I could not come to terms with this and even avoided watching any news related to it. Then the other night I saw this film for the first time and it was too much to bear. I cannot adequately explain my feelings and my sorrow at the deaths of so many. There is not even the anger at being able to say they could have been avoided. I feel helpless and insignificant. I don't have anxiety or nightmares, I only feel empty. It's what my soldier father used to call 'dead man walking'. He said many soldiers felt it after a battle having survived, while many of their comrades died. Not being able to comprehend why some had died, but they had survived. Perhaps this is it. This film was superb and brilliantly acted, so much so, it has awoken some terrible feelings.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Intense viewing experience with great performances from all,"Wow, this was an intense viewing experience, which brought me to tears more than once. I actually watched it twice with the rental, picking up little bits I'd missed the first time through. In my re-watch it was interesting to see the family 'before' after witnessing their 'after'. All clean and uninjured, careless and happy.The actual tsunami scenes are fantastic, very well shot or CGI'd(?), but its the aftermath with all the bloody (realistic) injuries, the hospital scenes and the chaos going on around the separated family as they try to find each other that really drew me in.More than once I questioned the decisions made by the adults (I'm pretty sure I'm not leaving my kids anywhere) but that's another reason I liked this so much, -what would you do? Outstanding performances from Naomi Watts, you can feel her pain and fear and also Ewan McGregor and the boy playing their oldest son Lucas.A couple of events towards the end had me thinking really!?

"A difficult watch, but most of it is outstanding.","A very tough film to review with any criticism as it is based on a true story during a truly horrendous event that took place in 2004 and that is, of course, the deadly tsunami that hit Thailand. The physical production of this is truly impressive, but it's a tough watch sometimes. There are so many lives involved in this terrible catastrophe, but this film focuses on one family and if the story is true, and by all accounts it is, it's a pretty miraculous one. A family with three children, two of which are very young, are swept away by the onslaught of the ocean. The focal point of the film is the mother played by Naomi Watts and her oldest son who is about 12 years old and what they go through is really hard to watch. Watts is excellent in a very physical role and her son is played by Tom Holland in an extremely impressive film debut. Ewan McGregor has a smaller role as the father, but he too is quite good. Unfortunately, the film does bog down a little bit in the latter parts, but that doesn't detract too much from the film's overall power. There is no doubt many will not consider this to be entertainment, which is primarily the reason why it wasn't a commercial success in the United States, but it was elsewhere. I recommend it, but I can understand why many will not want to see it.",8.0,Anonymous,History
One of the Best Films I've Seen---But Prepare Yourself Emotionally!,"It isn't often a movie makes an impact on me like this one. I normally wouldn't watch a movie like this--at first glance, it isn't what you think.This movie touches one on so many levels--and at its heart is what is most important: Relationships. Love. Family.Just be prepared for the intense emotions this film will bring out of you. I absolutely wept through most of the movie.Here's a great line (among many from critics reviews): A sensory overload of emotion and spectacle, The Impossible is a disaster movie much, much better than the usual overblown fare pumped out by Hollywood.It's like you are THERE, experiencing this horrific disaster with them-- especially as the mother and son are swept along, trying desperately to get to one another.The 10 minute scene of the tsunami alone took a year to shoot.It's powerful, gut-wrenching, emotional, incredibly touching, and oftentimes raw. Very realistic--and as a parent, wow--you just have to see it for yourself. This movie affected me deeply, perhaps more deeply then any other movie has. The acting was suburb--truly incredible film!",9.0,Anonymous,History
A Gripping Tale Of Emotions.,"For the first time, I actually cried after watching a Hollywood movie. The level of emotions depicted in this tale of a family braving the 2004 tsunami is absolute. 10 on 10.Director Juan knows how to make his audience gripped to the seat. Just like his previous venture, he is once again successful in creating a terror-based movie which induces thought, pain and utter cinema-feel.Naomi Watts is par excellence, so are the kids and McGregor has evolved after his Salmon fishing in the Yemen. I was awestruck at the minimal use of CGI and how the plot revolves on the family's plight than showing the tsunami aftermath.A great entertainer, The Impossible is one of the best films of 2012. I wonder why it didn't get nominated for AMPAS' Best Picture!WATCH OUT FOR: Naomi Watts.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

"Only rich Westerners matter, it seems","I make no comment on the quality of the acting or the cinematography which have been assessed elsewhere. This film openly expresses what must be the view of the writer Sergio G. Sánchez and the director Juan Antonio Bayona: the welfare of Westerners is of vital importance; the suffering of tens of thousands of local people is only the backdrop. That few Western reviewers - with the shining exception of Ed Gonzalez at Slant magazine - were interested in this glaring deficiency in one of the few widely-released films to present the tsunami is an indictment of the state of film reviewing in the corporate media.Apparently, Western viewers are incapable of understanding what happened to so many desperately poor people; we need to see it only as a disaster affecting rich, American tourists as a kind of theme park attraction on the lines of Jurassic Park.A shameful waste of talents. Sadly this is one of a long, seemingly unending line of films refusing to take the Global South seriously.",1.0,Anonymous,History

For me, Naomi Watts and Tom Holland made this film, but especially Holland. They're portrayal of the family members was spot on and they're acting was just superb. For a young guy Holland played his character which such great depth and pure emotion I could some how relate to him and feel like a part of his story and the situation. Ewan McGregor was also fantastic.This film is just utter amazement.

The virtue of human kindness,"The Impossible looked like a very sentimental, unnecessarily sprawling and messy contrived film where the white family saves the locals but in fact, it's the opposite, it's about community and saving your neighbour and features all kinds of nationalities in dire situations together. When our protagonist family is in trouble, they are helped and then when others are in trouble, our protagonist family help them. Human kindness is one of the most underrated virtues in cinema and how powerful it can be. The end of 127 Hours where Aron Ralston finally finds people after being isolated for so long drags me to tears every time I see it. The Impossible, while it's not as cathartic because of the quantity, features human kindness to this level in all of its sequences. It's a real emotional roller-coaster that's brought to life by its director as the script does show risks of being sentimental and contrived, it's played in exactly the right way. Although the characters are a little underdeveloped, they are more vehicles for archetypes, it still hits hard. And it's wonderfully overwhelming.As Juan Antonio Bayona is a director of horror, having directed the popular The Orphanage 6 years ago now, the terror of the soon-to-be-iconic tsunami scene is horrifying. There's a realism and a scale to it that pinches your gut. With the breath-taking sound design and precise editing, it's a masterwork in suspense despite knowing what's going to happen from the trailers. It's a truly immersive scene and every bump is felt. Although there is a hint of realism in this sequence with a surprising amount of gore, The Impossible is one of the most cinematic films I've seen in a long time, especially with its sweeping and near impossible cinematography, having all those cranes in the water. While I feared it would be too epic for its own good, it goes to a manageable and focused scale that it makes work and still manages to be intimate. Naomi Watts is astounding. She's probably the best actress today who can show pain and she marries the physical, emotional and psychological pain with the emotional core of her character incredibly well. She gives one of the best performances of the year for sure.Tom Holland is a welcome lead to the story and his bond with his mother is one of the most moving things about the film. Ewan McGregor is great in his role, despite not seeing him for the first half post-disaster, and highlights the value of compassion. Unfortunately, the film does lose some momentum after the reunion scene as there is little left to resolve for the last 20 minutes. I thought they were going to save it for the climax but it was just as cathartic as I hoped for. It does give it a brief feel of being procedural at that point as a mere retelling rather than storytelling, a factor that has been bugging me for 2012 when films have underwhelmed. But an ambiguous revisit to the tsunami brings things full circle and reminds us what an unforgettable moment that was. The Impossible is pure cinema and personally, finally brings scale to a traumatic event that I remember hearing about and not comprehending when I was 12. Maybe bad trailers are a blessing since it's the only way I can be surprised when they knock down my expectations. Maybe The Impossible grows on me. It's lack of character personality and scattered flaws holds it back from being a favourite but as a technical feat it is astonishing.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Very emotional, visceral, and intense, this one hits hard.","Based on true events, The Impossible centers on a family on vacation in Thailand, whose lives are affected after they're all separated by the tsunami that struck the land in December of 2004. Through the eyes of this family, we're witness to all the devastation and heartbreak surrounding this catastrophe, all gritty to the point that makes it hard to watch at points, although some of that may be the shaky cam as well. The whole cast is great, Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor specifically giving some of the best performances of their careers, pouring out so much sincere emotion. On a visceral level, on an emotional level, it hits HARD. Not only does it hit, it practically delivers a punch to the gut.

Blah Family in Disaster,"We went to see this based on a trailer that looked great combined with excellent reviews, but were very disappointed. The worst of it was that the characters lacked depth. ""Blah Family in Disaster"" would be a better title for this movie, since that's what you get. It seems like the director made a half-hearted attempt to establish some emotional depth for the characters before the disaster struck, but couldn't figure out how so just gave up and hoped that seeing them going through a hellish experience was all the plot he needed. What came out is chaos without any real drama.Need to pad this for the line counter, so if I'll just say that if you're looking for a disaster *drama* rent Earthquake, or even Deep Impact - just about anything with a disaster theme is better than this, except perhaps Mars Attacks!",2.0,Anonymous,History
"Gut-Wrenching, Emotional Film!","The Impossible is one of the best films of 2012 and one that will stick with me for the ages. It's a powerhouse when it comes to acting and the story itself. The screenplay is not the greatest, but it does work for the most part. This is based off one of the most horrific natural disasters in world history and I won't be ashamed to say that my eyes were often moist during the film.J.A Bayona directs a film based one family's account of the 2004 tsunami in Thailand. With Maria, her husband, and he three sons separated from each other, we see how they struggle to survive as they try to find each other.The acting is terrific especially by Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor. Watts best scenes were in the beginning but she deserves her Oscar nomination. McGregor has many powerful scenes as well. It's safe to say that both give their best performances of their career. I also must give a special mention to Tom Holland because it choked up during the scenes when he becomes the caretaker and the protector of his mother during most of the film.Overall, this is one incredible film about how one family achieved the impossible. It's powerful and often very shocking. I remember this event clearly and it's one that I can never forget. The VFX was great as they recreated the deadly wave that killed many, many people. I felt like it was the actual wave, so the special effects team did a great job. Other than a so-so script, this is one of the best films of 2012. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Realistic Disaster movie with a flaw,"THE IMPOSSIBLE is based on a real-life tragedy, what is known as the boxing day tsunami, which claimed nearly 230,000 lives in parts of India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand and other countries. The film focuses on the fate a British family of 5 who happen to be in Thailand as tourists when their resort is flooded by a massive tidal wave.Having recently seen the Norwegian movie THE WAVE, which also focuses on the fate of a family caught up in a massive tidal wave (this time in Norway), I cannot resist a comparison.What struck me most about THE WAVE was that this Norwegian movie basically out-Hollywooded Hollywood: there was a strong emphasis on special effects sequences, a number of ''bare miss'' situations in which the protagonists managed to survive by just a hair's width, and plenty of emotional scenes which pulled on the heartstrings. However, because at times the situations just seemed too unrealistic, it took away from the authenticity of the emotional pull.In contrast, THE IMPOSSIBLE seems much more realistic. The special effects sequences are sparser but still extremely well-executed, and although the protagonists do have a good share of fortune in their misfortune, it never really strains credulity. Together with the outstanding performances and production design across the board, this gave a real-life feel to the events.Most of the film takes place in the aftermath of the tsunami, and while watching it, I caught myself thinking ""so this is what it would be like if one were to be caught up in and survive this event"". Very few disaster movies are so realistic that they offer a genuine vicarious experience. The IMPOSSIBLE did, THE WAVE did not.So, judged purely as a disaster drama, THE IMPOSSIBLE is the better film. However, I ended up rating both the same because THE IMPOSSIBLE has one glaring flaw: I could not come by hard numbers, but the number of tourists who fell victim to the tsunami were a tiny fraction (probably on the order of 2-5%) of the total. Yet, in the movie all victims with speaking roles are tourists.To the extent that there are any Thai people, they are represented sympathetically, as in the cases of the old man who carries the female protagonist, and the nurse who helps the boy find his mother. However, they are not really represented as people, and we get little sense of how the devastation has affected their lives; lives which, unlike those of the tourist survivors who get to go home, have to rebuilt right where the disaster happened.That means the movie unapologetically takes the perspective of the rich white tourists, and as such opens itself to the charge of bigotry. I am myself not certain of this, since I realize that there is only so much which can be shown in a 2-hour movie (though the end credits are 11 minutes long!), and having too many story threads can hurt the film. Nonetheless, it left a little unpleasant taste, and I subtracted one point for that.",8.0,Anonymous,History
The Impossible was a truly well made drama about one family's survival of the 2004 tsunami,"Just watched this movie on Netflix disc with my mom. This was a real intense movie about one family's survival of the 2004 tsunami but ultimately touching story as well especially that of the oldest son and mother's sticking together during the whole ordeal. Naomi Watts truly deserved her Oscar nomination as that mom who suffers some pain but perseveres with the support of that son and eventually the whole family. There might have been some scenes that may have been a bit standoffish but, really, for the most part, this was a really well made drama with great performances by all involved and mostly well made direction as well. So on that note, I highly recommend The Impossible.",9.0,Anonymous,History
The best film of 2012,"The Impossible was the best film or 2012 in my opinion. Not since Saving Private Ryan had I been so emotionally invested in a film from the first frame. I knew little to nothing about the movie before watching it and I think that is the best way to go into this movie. I encourage anyone to give this movie a look as I feel you will not be disappointed. The Impossible was a hit overseas but for some reason American audiences didn't connect with it or it got overlooked. I have shown this movie to most of my family and a bunch of friends and they have all had the same overwhelming reaction that it was an amazing movie and one of the best films they have seen in a long time.My older brother who is a huge movie buff had never heard of this movie. When he told me that, I was kind of in shock. How did I come across such a gem of a movie that he and never heard of. I watched it with him and he was captivated from beginning to end. When the movie was over he actually felt ashamed that he had never heard of it and didn't know how it had not won the Oscar for best picture. He then began to research who the director and writer was so he could see what else they have done and watch that.I know you don't know my brother, but if you did you would know that he doesn't just take that big of an interest in anyone. He saw a gifted writing and amazing direction and wanted to know what else was out there that he could watch from the writer or director.

"""The Best Film Of 2012""","The raw intensity displayed in The Impossible is enough to reign uncontrollable emotion upon the audience, as J.A Bayona has crafted a flick about clinging onto hope, while also going to insane lengths to depict the most brutal and honest vision of the tragic 2004 tsunami, which so happened to tangle an innocent tourist family in the act. And this is their story conveyed through cinema.The Impossible is one of the most emotionally powerful movies I have ever seen, from the standpoint of the acting to the precision-based directing. It wrenches through the hearts of those who dare to experience the mesmerizing picture, but at the same time, it's absolutely worth it for the satisfying arc about holding onto hope, and the importance of family.The performances are harrowing, dunked in realism, and involve the viewer with the characters as well as the central situation that they are plagued with. Ewan McGregor gives what I personally think is his greatest acting performance yet, Naomi Watts is forced with a lot of roundabouts and tough situations but manages to be as great as ever, and the children performances including Tom Holland were charming and added another great element to the overall grand scope of this movie.One sequence in the movie, about half-way through the first act, was so intensely real and crafted with so much mastery, that I'm ashamed of the lack of praise J.A Bayona has been receiving. This man is a wonderful talent, and a clear rivalry of Steven Spielberg, who has been recognized for the way he visualizes stories and art through screen, but unfortunately he still has not received the amount of praise that he deserves. The fact that he was not nominated for best director at the 2013 Oscars, SCARES ME.The Impossible is one of the most incredible film experiences I have been treated to in the past few decades, as it depicts the true horror and affect of the 2004 tsunami, but also sparks hope. Hope that keeps people holding on. It is acted with a tremendous amount of investment and care, directed with an admirable amount of effort, and shot with the kind of realism that only true filmmakers can implement so intensely.

The Impossible — A family caught in the 2004 tsunami,"The Impossible is based on true events, and it has the merit of showing its public how catastrophic that 2004 south-east Asian tsunami was, but there its merits end. I guess what most people liked was the fact that it really happened to a family and it tugged at their heartstring, because cinematographically speaking, it's not worth much. Most of its fault are certainly the consequence of sticking to facts. That better done in a documentary.There's basically no rhythm to the movie, the scenes are just thrown one after the other, just like in real life, but with the polish of a movie, which is a bad dichotomy. I mean, the ""homemade"" video sequence is no such thing. We just get jangled around a little bit more. The editing is poor. In some places the reaction times are stretched to push more drama. A big mistake. There's also the failure to capitalize on real drama.

The Most Shocking Movie I Have Ever Seen,"When I first saw the trailer of ""The Impossible"" I had my doubts to be honest. How do you want to make a movie of this event which isn't offensive to some people? Nonetheless, I decided to watch it, as I'm a big fan of Ewan McGregor, who plays the dad.The result after about 110 minutes was nothing but shock and sadness. I saw the TV reports in 2004, but somehow never thought that it was that extreme (ok, I was pretty young back then). When you watch Naomi Watts crawling around in dirt and full of pain, it's like you feel the pain as well. When you watch Tom Holland missing his mother and despair, you fell the desperation as well. And this is the case all the time. But that's also the thing which makes this movie so great. During the whole movie you share the drill with the characters, that they find each other again. After the movie you are, like I wrote already, just shocked and you wonder how this could happen and how many families were separated because of it.At last, I want to say that the performance of the actors and actresses is just fantastic. It looks like Tom Holland, the oldest of the three children, is the ""unofficial"" main character, but in this case it's not bad that a kid has the main role, as he plays it so awesome. The others are of course great, too.So, my conclusion: A shocking yet amazing movie. The only reason why I don't give it ten stars is because there are some very nasty scenes in it (blood, injuries, etc.), and I'm not a fan of something like that. But yeah, if you don't need action or comedy in every film, you'll like it for sure.",9.0,Anonymous,History
The Impossible,"A incredible movie of parental and family love. This obviously loving family settle in at a resort in Thailand, celebrate Christmas, and then the most horrific event happens. The tsunami hits the coast of Thailand and their lives are changed to survival. I could never imagine the force of the water that hit the coast -the movie does a great job of giving you that feeling. Then the people - the destruction of families is so hard to watch - the hope of families survives. This family was so fortunate and obviously have a deep love for each other. The father searching for his wife and son, and at the same time sending his other boys off to safety. Tom Holland who plays Lucas is terrific - the connection between him an Naomi Watts is believable. He gives a great performance. Naomi Watts is equally good as the mother - wounded in many ways and still not giving up. She knows what is happening to her body and tries to hang one and have hope. At times this was a hard movie to watch but I think it is truthfully presented - being a nurse the conditions of the makeshift hospital - it was horrific. And yet given the conditions - life went on. The people searching for loved ones is well presented. A good film of a sometimes hard to watch event - good work coming out of Spain.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Incredibly moving.,"The Impossible was one of the most suffocating and powerful emotional dramas I've ever seen and the fact that it is a true story constantly plays in the back of your mind while watching, effectively multiplying the emotion and drama even more. The acting was incredible and the special effects, especially the tsunami scene in the beginning, were fantastic. Having seen almost most of the critically acclaimed films in the 2012 year, I can now say that they made a mistake in giving the Best Actress in a Leading Role to Jennifer Lawrence for her role in The Silver Linings Playbook. That award should've gone to Naomi Watts for her incredible and moving performance in this film. Lawrence did great but Watts was amazing, key difference in my opinion.

Hypersentimental and melodramatic,"I watched this movie together with my wife, and we both found it laughable just because of the severely exaggerated character. The dark rising basses and sensitive piano play (one single tone per five seconds) when something occurs that is thought to be dramatic, it's all so forcibly meant to impress that it's one big gesture of bad taste. The wise and deep sayings that must incite you to take this very serious, as also with Ewan (the father) suddenly and grippingly bursting into tears... o how profound! Give me a break, will you. The real event itself was serious, not this monstrous production that clearly was meant as a tearjerker smoothly exploiting grave incidents. Why on earth was it rated that high? Are Americans so melodramatic, or is it political correctness that makes people believe that you ought to value and esteem any film about such a dramatic topic? Could you earnestly compare this to such quality movies like Collateral, the Godfather part 3, Munich, Dracula (Bela Lugosi, 1931), Love actually, Rabbit-proof fence, A room with a view, Never let me go, Steel magnolias, and many other films that were rated somewhat about the same level or even lower, but that are of a whole different (e.g. far better) quality?",4.0,Anonymous,History

This film is a great example of how to take the terrible nature of such an event and create a really compelling story about the themes of love, hope, helplessness and, above all, panic.The story focuses around one family as they struggle to find each other and stay alive in the aftermath of the vicious tsunami of 2004. However it still does a lot to show the mass horror the tsunami caused for everyone involved. Not a lot of films do this in my opinion, they manage to keep us connected to that family whilst also making us feel for every character we see. This is done as well as, if not better than, Titanic. The story manages to strike the right nerve at the right time, it gives us just the right amount of hope for our characters, which is cleverly juxtaposed by the feelings of helplessness and dread.As said, the film takes you on an emotional journey, and this is in no small part due to our actors. The acting is fantastic all round. McGregor is reliably good as ever although he didn't have as much screen time as I would have hoped. Naomi Watts has really entered my radar recently, I've been seeing some of her films and she really is one of the best actresses of this generation. However Tom Holland as Lucas owns this film. He isn't even 18 yet and I wouldn't be surprised if he becomes a very big star in film. The other kids played their parts very well. The acting adds to the great character development so much so that I actually found myself hoping the tsunami wouldn't actually happen.This film really surprised me and I didn't even plan on seeing it. No film is perfect, but this one left me feeling emotionally drained. Hollywood could certainly learn a lot of lessons from this about how to make a compelling film without the need for clichés and formulaic plots. The Impossible comes with my highest recommendation for those who want a subtle but emotionally moving film about the lengths ordinary people will go to protect those they love.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Mediocre disaster movie,"I was cautiously excited the moment I learned that the director of the movie, Bayona, is also the director of the lovely sad horror movie 'The Orphanage'. Still, shooting a disaster movie has a number of drawbacks -hence the caution-. 1) developing a character without resorting to clichés, such as the scared man/woman turning resilient, broken couple who rediscover each other, etc. 2) relying on too much on the technique -everyone wants to shoot a lovely disaster scene, which often shadows the movie itself- 3) finding an original way to tell the story.Since the work is based on a true story, Bayona has an excuse on narrative issues. But he doesn't have any excuses on a lot of mistakes:1. No character development: We barely learn anything about our typical white family before the tsunami hits. Actually, it makes sense; because our family is so ordinary, so typical white; that developing a character out of them is almost impossible. Hence, he lets the tsunami roll as early as possible.2. Inconclusive attempts: Bayona tries to create small stories, but almost all of them fails miserably. In the early stages, we catch our adolescent male protagonist looking at her mother's breast with mixed feelings. Only natural if you are adolescent, but Bayona doesn't follow the trail; he leaves it there. Why did you start it in the first place then?Also, we see the mom reading Conrad -most probably ""The Heart of Darkness""- in the plane on their way to Thailand. Nice touch to stress the white - indigenous tension, and nice referral to Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"". Nevertheless, if you imply such a tension, you have to give the audience the follow-up your promise, which Bayona fails to do so. A careful eye will observe two-three other subtexts which Bayona put forward to make his story more interesting, but none goes anywhere. I have a feeling that the stories were most probably lost on the editing table. Or worse: Bayona wants to show off, ""Look, I know Conrad! I even read a couple of works on post-colonial studies!""3. I'm not even mentioning the lack of subtleties in the movie: the indigenous dragging the mom in spite of her leg wound, and the son not preventing it, etc.Avid movie lovers know the difference between a 'character' and a 'type'. This movie doesn't have a single character; and this would have worked if Bayona tried to create a distance between the victimised typical white family and the audience. But you cannot prevent your audience to create an emotional attachment with the victims, and as a matter of fact, we can't see any traces of Bayona making an effort on that, either. For instance, there is no side-story that would have made the deeper. Instead, all the tragedy of the 'else', apart from a couple of white side-kicks who happen to have the chance to bump into our white protagonists, is reduced into general ""Oh, see how dramatic it is!"" shots.All in all, this movie is full of intellectual inconsistencies and half-spent efforts; which drags it into the league of mediocre and typical disaster movies. Makes me think that the real magic in ""the Orphanage"" was not director Bayona, but the executive producer, known by the name, Guillermo del Toro.",5.0,Anonymous,History
The Impossible takes you inside the tsunami of 2004,"While you hear about major event son the news all the time, seeing them come to life on the big screen brings them more to life giving viewers a bit of a closer idea of what those involved went through. One of the most shocking natural disasters took place in 2004 when a tsunami hit across Indonesia taking the lives over 200,000 people. This tragic event has now been brought to life in the film The Impossible based on one family experiences during this event, but is it able to convey the terror and desperation these people lived through?The Impossible follows a family on Christmas vacation in Thailand. While hanging out by the pool enjoying the sun and fun, there comes a roar in the distance that will change their lives forever. This is an intense and powerful film that delivers way more than you may have thought from the initial trailers. The cast all do a great job with each of them having to convey a variety of emotions. The story is so insanely unbelievable you have to see it to believe it. Seeing what these people had to endure to survive not only keeps you on edge, but also gets you thinking about what other people had to endure that was easily much worse. The story structure really makes this film even more powerful than it may have been if delivered straight forward. It starts a bit slow while setting things up and makes you almost forget what is coming, only to suddenly slap you in the face when it hits the fan and never truly let's up. Sure there isn't much action beyond the initial destructive force, but the sheer drama and torment these people deal with in the aftermath will keep you stressed and on the edge of your seat. In addition it bounces back and forth between the various characters telling their stories, but still keeping the primary focus on the initial leads. High praise for both the actors and filmmakers for the choice to use and endure actual water on set for the scenes as opposed to all CGI. There is some CGI of course, but the scenes that are the most effective are those watching them really deal with the danger of the water. This keeps you invested in the film and the believability constant.While this movie looked good from the trailers it delivers a lot more than you would expect. The performances are great; the visuals are beautiful and terrifying and it respectfully tackles a tragic event with intensity and passion to let you understand a small bit of what these people really dealt with. There are two sequences that to describe may not sound all that bad, but visually are brutal to watch and will no doubt effect you on some level which is what a great film is supposed to do.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"""The Impossible"" is based on the true story of a family on vacation in Thailand, who find themselves caught in one of the worst natural disasters on all time.","""The Impossible"" is based on the true story of a family on vacation in Thailand, who find themselves caught in one of the worst natural disasters on all time -the 2004 tsunami. Among tens of thousands of strangers, the members of this family are forced to fight the elements and the catastrophe to try and find each other and remain together.The cinematography of this film was wonderful. It captured the disastrous scenes perfectly, allowing us to see the devastation but also to appreciate the beauty of it all as well.This movie was wonderfully cast. Naomi Watts' portrayal of Maria, a mother in an incredible amount on pain due to her injuries, who struggles to remain strong for her son, all while trying to find safety and the rest of her family was so beautiful and perfectly performed. Ewan MacGregor also did a great job portraying his character Henry. MacGregor plays a father who is struggling to care for his two young sons while trying to find the rest of his family. Along the way, he is forced to make some very difficult decisions that prove to us how truly determined he is. Both interpretations of the parents seemed very genuine.Sam Joslin who plays Thomas, the middle son, also performed his character quite well. He managed to walk the fine line of being the innocent little brother to Lucas but the mature and strong older brother to Simon quite gracefully. Oaklee Pendergast who portrays the youngest son Simon did a wonderful job as well. He displayed great control and execution of his emotions for such a young actor.With all of that being said; I firmly believe that the best acting came from the character Lucas, as portrayed by Tom Holland. In my opinion, he was definitely the star of the film. He displayed incredible maturity and delivered a performance well beyond his few years. His emotional and facial expressions alone left you with chills at times. I honestly couldn't help but fall in love with his character but also with him as a young actor. Mr. Holland is definitely one to watch for in films to come.In conclusion, ""The Impossible"" is an absolutely beautiful film that is both heart wrenching and heart warming at the same time. It is absolutely, without a doubt, worth a watch.",9.0,Anonymous,History

You have to see this!,"Before I first saw this film, I had hardly any expectations. I knew Naomi Watts was nominated for an Oscar and that it was based around the devastating 2004 Thailand tsunami, but not much else.The premise of the film is simple: a family, which contains of 3 children and their parents are in shock after the tsunami and are trying to locate the other members of the family, whilst surviving.The acting in this movie is indeed spectacular. Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor do not in any way disappoint, they are as convincing as ever. At first I was a bit unconvinced by Lucas, played by Tom Holland. I thought his acting wasn't on par but later on in the movie I was proved wrong. He has some talent and can showcase a wide range of emotions.My only problem with the film is that the pacing was a bit slow at the beginning. I wondered how it would go on for 2 hours without boring me to death. As the script developed, however, I felt more and more attached to the story and the characters in it. It does a great job of immersion.In conclusion, this is a must-see movie that will make you feel for the characters through their bad and good times. It will make you think about appreciating your life and the ones close to you.9/10",8.0,Anonymous,History

One Of The Best Films Of 2012,"I had high expectations for this film as it looked like something that would be nominated for Best Picture or something just as prestigious. When the awards came, it did not get enough praise as I thought it would. So my expectations of this film was a little lower coming in, now that I have finally seen it, I am baffled on this film not being regarded as one of the best films of 2012.The film's plot is that this British family who lives in Japan, who decides to take a Christmas holiday in Thailand and a tsunami hits the holiday resort which forces them to be separated form one another. Screenplay written by Sergio Sanchez, who also did the screenplay of J.A Bayona's previous film The Orphanage, is an amazing story of family and resiliency. The strongest area of the film is the event of the tsunami and, Maria and Lucas' attempt to find each other. It's really powerful and moving. The latter half of the film may not be as strong and frightening as the first half but it still works as the aftermath of the event on this family.I have a feeling that in the future, we are all going to see a lot Juan Antonio Bayona's films being critically acclaimed and receiving awards. He knows how to create something so shocking without making it feel unfamiliar. We all see injuries and pain everyday but not like this. I cringed a couple of times on the gashes that are found on people. He wanted to make the event to feel heavy and really see the impact it has on the family, whether it's emotional or physical trauma. The disaster scene alone was suspenseful and felt that maybe someone won't make it. Bayona doesn't want the CGI effects of this film to feel too ambitious or too flashy and just focusing on making it feel real. The ending was predictable but after what these people have just went through it's acceptable.Beautiful. Simply Gorgeous. The way Oscar Faura captured Thailand before and after the incident are done so well that it sometimes dominates the scene. The lighting feels very natural and doesn't at any point become too forced or artificial. Even cramped and intimate moments in the hospital or the plane works. There will be at times where the camera feels shaky but I felt that it was tamed well and doesn't feel at all distracting.A lot of the people working on this film has worked with Guillermo Del Toro productions before and I think that's what makes the film work at times as the crew know each other and knows each others abilities. Fernando Velazquez is the film's composer and I am familiar with his recent film Mama, also produced by Guillermo Del Toro. The Impossible's score at the start is subtle but as the drama elevates, his score becomes bigger. I did not really took notice of the score's presence at times as it has been outshone by fantastic cinematography and amazing acting performances.Everybody in this film was great, in particular Naomi Watts. You really see it in her performance that everything that just happened hit her like a wave, don't mind the pun, and makes her vulnerable emotionally as well as physically. There was a beautiful scene with her, her son and this young boy they were able to save and the boy caresses her hair as a way of saying thank you, this scene shows the best in her acting as she didn't need to say anything and yet so much about her character is said with a single smile. Ewan McGregor was good but I felt didn't carry it as much as Watts did but nevertheless great. How Bayona was able to get something great in the children's acting was beyond me because they were fantastic.One of the best films of 2012, probably just under my favorite Silver Linings Playbook, and is deserving of much more praise than it currently has. Strong performances from the actors and moving drama made this film unforgettable. Bayona has made a film that shows the other filmmakers out there he is a force to be reckon with. I am excited to see what he is going to make next and hopefully it's as beautifully crafted as this one.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Impossibly good,"I thought the film was brilliantly made and extremely moving, it really stays with you. Tom Holland was superb as the young Lucas and the rest of the cast was also fantastic.While I understand the criticism about the focus being on a western family and keeping indigenous victims in the background, I liked the simplicity of the narrative, following this one family's story. It wouldn't have had the same impact if it had knitted together lots of story threads. It avoided the traps of other films like it, letting the action and emotion speak for themselves, without the need for uncomfortable exposition explaining the wave (I don't think the words tsunami or earthquake even get a mention) or telling us what happened to the characters later over the end credits. There was no need for names, long introductions and back story for the supporting characters – there was too much distress and chaos for anyone to dwell on those things and it would have felt unnatural. The audience doesn't need to have it spelt out that the devastation was far-reaching and that this family's story was exceptional – it's all there on screen.I think it's been terribly overlooked in the awards, for both technical and acting categories. It should surely be up there for sound and effects, and the hair and make-up category shouldn't be limited to period dramas! Tom Holland should certainly have been nominated for the Bafta Rising Star.It was tough to watch but contained enough moments of hope, human kindness, and happy reunion to make it enjoyable too. Definitely a film to see on the big screen.",9.0,Anonymous,History
It's the name that intrigues you the most...!,"As for the movie,it is the plot that feeds off the actors..Its been an awesome last year for Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper and it looks like this year is going to be no different..A packed storyline embellished on its course by the rising above-mentioned star duo and Eva Mendes sure seems enough to keep you on tenterhooks throughout the flick but somewhere along the ride things become distraught kept intact only by the solidness of Cooper and Mendes;one of whom might even be worthy of an Oscar for spectacular acting display..Eva Mendes is hot even when she is sad..She has given some real heart to the performance..While the same can't be said of the Hangover star,there is no way he doesn't play his conflicting cop/DA character to near-perfection.. Now moving on to Ryan Gosling...Man,he is nuts..maybe that's how he is in real life..A carefree,lover turned caring father @ bank robber..he plays his role to absolute perfection..Almost reminds you of his role in ""Blue Valentine"",only better..This guy is so versatile you would think he could have donned Bradley Cooper's role even better than the latter..Now whether the same can be said for Bradley Cooper?;I am not sure..Which is exactly why it's a shame that Ryan Gosling won't be Oscar nominated because his role albeit short-lived is only a lead-point to this wonderfully written movie.. The only critique I have is that the film could have been shorter and although the two teens in the later part of the film have grooved well into their roles of drug-addicts(the address of the issue in such a flick is pretty smart i think),you can't help but feel this three part saga about ambitions and karma is a bit disjointed at turns and can bite you in the ass... But mostly it's a movie to be cherished,enjoyed and digested for the sheer brilliance of an intricate plot and tremendous direction form Derek Cianfrance..A must-watch for pure cinema lovers!

This film is well written and has a fantastic cast, Naomi Watts and Tom Holland especially, their performances alone blew my mind, it's just unbelievable how great they were and the chemistry between both of them is unquestionable. This time I gotta agree with the critics, they praised Watts, Holland, and McGregor's performances, which I agree and I'm sure all of us who have watched the film agree too.If this film was released earlier, then it wouldn't be so overlooked, I'm still upset how this film only earned 1 nomination at the Oscars, I mean, at least the Academy should nominate them for technical achievement or even Tom Holland's performance. Naomi Watts' performance is just wow..wow and wow. Personally, she should have won the prestigious Oscar that year but I think It's okay that she didn't win, I hope she's gonna have some left over votes for her performance as Princess Diana in her upcoming film 'Diana'.I'm glad this film was commercial success and how many people loved it.

A Brilliant Portrayal Of A Horrible Disaster,"Yes. The movie was ""anglicized."" The ""true"" story on which this is based was actually the story of a Spanish family and not an English family. That bothers some people. I have to say that it didn't really bother me. Whenever I come across the ""true"" story tag on a movie, I always assume that the term should be interpreted loosely. The point of this particular ""true"" story didn't depend on the identity of the family. To me, at least, who admittedly watched this tragedy unfold on television in the safety of my home in Canada, the story was ""true"" in the sense that it gave a harrowingly realistic depiction of what it might have been like to have been on the coast of Thailand on December 26, 2004, when the massive tsunami struck.This film moves quickly into the story. There's a very brief depiction of the family on the plane, and a very brief depiction of Christmas, and then - suddenly and without any warning - the tsunami strikes, as the family are playing at a pool at a resort. The depiction of the tsunami is quite terrifying. It was an excellent job of recreating the disaster and giving those of us watching as much of a feel as we possibly could have. The immediate aftermath of the tsumani follows mother Maria and son Lucas, who struggle together with the raging waters and finally manage to get to a hospital. All the while father Henry, and sons Thomas and Simon are desperately trying to find them. You can feel the chaos of the situation, and the movie goes from one emotionally gut wrenching scene to another almost all the way through. The performances from the cast who played the family were brilliant. All were totally and completely believable in their depiction of their terror and their utter lostness.There are a few minor quibbles one can make about this aspect of the story or that aspect of the story having been changed. I daresay those types of quibbles are always possible when dealing with a movie based on a ""true"" story. But this movie succeeded in what I believe its purpose was: to use the experience of one family to give the viewer just a taste of what had happened in Thailand on December 26, 2004 and its aftermath. In fact, it succeeded brilliantly. (10/10)",10.0,Anonymous,History

Excellently executed.,"THE IMPOSSIBLEI remember watching the news at Christmas time in 2004 and thinking how bad the Tsunami hit the world. It made a very happy time of year a disaster there were over 200,000 deaths in numerous countries around the world. This film is about one families fight to survive and be reunited together.The film is shot so well. The whole thing is so realistic and scary. It brought back memories of watching the news. It is a sad story this film really does show how dangerous nature can be. Life is a precious thing and we should all cherish the time we have together, because all it takes is one natural disaster and it is all over.Anyway back to the movie. The direction of this film is brilliant and deserves praise. The film was directed by J. A. Bayona. He has a bright future ahead of him if he sticks to making films like this.The acting is really good from everyone. It was a very honest and heartfelt performance from the cast. Ewan McGregor, Naomi Watts, Tom Holland, Samuel Joslin & Oaklee Pendergast star as the family. The children in the film also did a great job, which is hard seeing as all child actors are generally annoying and really bad at acting natural in front of a camera. But all 3 were brilliant.The only negative things I can say about this movie is it does not answer all the questions. You meet characters in the movie that are on a similar quest to find their family, but you never find out if they find them. I wanted to know I had to Google it afterwards and you can find the answers that way, but they should have included it in the movie.The other thing that I was a little bit disappointed about was the choice of actors yes, they did a brilliant job, but the family this film is based on is Spanish why do we need an actor from Scotland and an actress from Australia? Why couldn't they find decent Spanish actors and kept it more to the real story. I know all true stories have changes in them and made up bits, but this was one I thought was pointless.The emotions through this film is strong there are some very sad moments and some very happy moments. You really do get to connect with this family and the people they meet on the way. Not knowing if you family is dead or alive must be a horrible feeling and their search is so long. The film is a roller-coaster from beginning to end and it is a great ride to go on.I will give this film 8 out of 10.Possible the best natural disaster film ever made.""Go help people.

An Improbable Truth,"This film is recommended.The Impossible could have easily been retitled The Improbable with all the changes that director Juan Antonio Bayona and screenwriter Sergio G. Sanchez stuffed into their disaster drama, foremost being the nationality of the real Spanish family becoming Anglo-Saxon embodiment of Naomi Watt and Ewan McGregor in the lead roles of Maria and Enrique Belón a.k.a. Mr. and Mrs. Bennett in the film. The Impossible tells of their harrowing survival during their 2004 Christmas holiday at a tropical resort in Thailand when they became victims during a devastating tsunami that killed and injured over 200,000 people.The film almost immediately begins with its realistic depiction of these horrific events. The CGI sequence of the tsunami is frightening in its power and effectively chilling, even more skillfully done than in Clint Eastwood's film, Hereafter. ( It really deserved to be an Oscar contender in that category, yet it was inexplicably overlooked. )After that disturbing sequence, the film settles in for scenes of destruction and suffering, as seen through the eyes of the Bennett family members. Images of the dead or dying, the wreckage of property and human lives, everything surrounding them...in turmoil. With each new day comes an insurmountable obstacle, a sense of hopelessness and further despair. Whenever the film stays with those hardships and keeps its realistic edge, the film excels in its unflinching point of view.Where the film comes a bit undone is in its eagerness to overstate its uplifting and life- affirming message. There are some fine moments of genuine drama in The Impossible before it becomes awash with needless melodramatic lapses and enough sentimentality to get those tear ducts flowing in overdrive, not only for the film's actors, but more so, for every movie-going audience members.Perhaps the film's finest asset is the exemplary acting by Naomi Watts and newcomer Tom Holland who plays Lucas, the oldest son. Their unique emotional bond as mother and child is convincingly natural. Both actors seem to convey the courage and stamina that was needed for the real-life tragedy and encompass the human spirit and compassion that prevailed over difficult and grueling times. ( which probably could include the endless submerged filming and physical demands of their roles in this movie ). Also strong in a supporting role is McGregor. With less screen time, he efficiently captures the sense of loss and frustration as he tries to piece together his family. All in all, the acting in this film is outstanding in so many subtle ways and helps to make the film even more compelling.But ultimately, The Impossible seems to suffer more from a lack of conviction by its filmmakers in telling the so-called true story. They have undoubtedly created a well-made film. Yet they can't resist the urge to embellish the real events. Rather than believe in the essential truth in this tale of survival, Bayona and Sanchez play fast and loose with the facts. ( Yet another example: The real survivor lost half of her leg, but obviously the filmmakers thought that aspect is a tad too depressing for today's moviegoers. Instead, more family hugs and tearful embraces will suffice. ) After all, who needs the truth when half of that will get you that false feeling of hope and happiness, plus maybe a little more profit at the box office!Oh, if only the filmmakers had as much courage as their real-life inspiration. Then, and only then, would The Impossible have truly become The Impressive.

I have liked his work as Spider-Man and seeing him as a pre teen, I can definitely say that kid's a great actor.
Having been to Thailand after the tsunami, I've seen first hand how much destruction it caused and how the people were still recovering even years later.

"""Lucas, Lucas, Lucas!""  ""Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!""  A Really Ridiculous Movie in Several Respects","After they survive the tsunami, his indulgent mom calls Lucas so many times that it will drive you up a tree, which is where the pair finally find themselves after being hit by the wave and nearly dragged out to sea in the backwash. Somehow, they didn't drown outright, which comes off as a tad hard to swallow. The experience scratched up the kid and hurt the mom more seriously, but the worst part was when a local villager drug her through the mud in a misguided effort to save her. That, I seem to recall, is what made her absolutely filthy and she never got cleaned off, not even when they were delivered to a hospital. There, she ended up in surgery, still muddied of course, even though the doctors and nurses were decked out in scrubs and masks and both they and the operating room were spotless. The contradiction between the filthy patient and the sterile surgical team was rather startling and silly. Movies and television don't understand the first frigging thing about sterile procedure, and I include in that pointed criticism the stupid show called ""ER"" that made George Clooney's career take off. Just because a health care professional or a detective dons latex gloves doesn't mean they can touch any nonsterile object (like a gruesome corpse), grab their pen and notebook or a doorknob, and then remove said gloves and regrab the same now contaminated pen and notebook or doorknob. If you don't understand why, then I don't know how to explain it to you any plainer than that. It's why public restrooms still have a door that opens in rather than out, despite other improvements that limit cross contamination. You have to grab the door handle to exit, and you must have noticed how many people simply don't bother washing their hands after using the facilities. If, after washing your own hands, you don't grab that handle with a paper towel, then you just got that guys germs all over your hand, you know, the dumb slob who just emerged from the stall after making a real stink. Think about it. In any case, wouldn't someone have cleaned these people off at least minimally when they were given a bed in a hospital? And wouldn't a person brought into surgery certainly have been properly prepped for the experience? Not in this movie. The entire family was muddied from the getgo and still muddy by the time they hopped on a jet for Singapore. It was absurd. ""Hey, folks, just allow our seats to absorb all that disgusting filth. Considering what a bad day you've had, we won't insist that you minimally clean up before boarding."" Not to harp on this issue too much, but one of the first things you should do after you are caught in a catastrophe and survived is to clean up. Those cuts and scratches and abrasions will become infected, especially in floodwaters, which are frequently swarming with bacteria. I guess they forgot about that niggling little problem when they made this dumb flick. Better to leave the actors ""realistically filthy"" so as to emphasize the extent of the terrible ordeal they had just experienced and the level of shock they are exhibiting. That major objection aside, this movie was schmaltzy, unrealistic, and rather stupid. In no way does it communicate the extent of the real tragedy that occurred that day, when upwards of 200,000 people were killed. The best scene is the flashback of the moment the tsunami hit the resort, in which the mother tumbles over and over in the water, gets hit by objects, and somehow doesn't need to breathe. It's better than the depiction of the tragedy when it occurred, by the time of which you are totally sick of the family and don't much care what happens to them.",1.0,Anonymous,History

Wrenching But Perhaps Worth The Watch,"I thought I was ready to see a movie about this subject by now, but in actuality I wasn't. There are some events that have occurred in a person's lifetime that never seem to fade9/11and this horrendous tsunami for example. Happenings so painful and emotional that time doesn't seem to help numb the brain, the heart, enough to be able to offer any sort of dispassionate observation. This film is excellent. The casting and the acting couldn't have been better. And I guess I'm glad I saw it, but then again.there were parts I was unable to watch and I left the theater wanting to just go home and cry. The movie has resurrected all the pain, the sorrow, I felt watching that shocking scene unfold, watching so many lives be swept away, so many families ripped apart, so much loss.

I think it was when we'd finished telling mum's story and then started telling dad's. You could have easily put in a commercial break and I wouldn't have noticed. Having said that, the doubt started creeping in when Coke got its product placement in with a mini sub plot all of its own.I think I must be getting tired in my old age of predictable filmmaking with long, tedious storylines, delivered by these tiresome, stereotypically impossibly perfect families - maybe that's why it's called The Impossible.",2.0,Anonymous,History

One family's Odyssey amidst the destruction and chaos of the Southeast Asian tsunami.,"Naomi Watts delivers a strong performance as the mother of a family torn apart by the tsunami, but Tom Holland's performance carries the movie. Holland dominates the movie throughout,subtly changing his emotions from fear, to strength, to despair. A performance overlooked by the various film awards. An actor to watch for in the future. Not an easy movie to watch, but one that speaks to the power of family. Scene with Geraldine Chaplin and a young boy is a moment of simple wonder in an otherwise chaotic time. Cinematography adds to the emotional impact of both the actual tsunami striking the coast ofThailand, and the human scope of the disaster's aftermath.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Overall it's a great movie, perfect acting from the whole cast.","What an intense film. Naomi Watts takes on a challenging role and she really embraced it, impeccable acting. But it's worth noting that the real star of the movie is newcomer Tom Holland, as Watt's son in the film. His acting is so natural which manages to immerse you in the film led by a great script and great director. He managed to project that feeling of anger, sadness and helplessness throughout the struggle with his mother in the hospital.This is a tear jerker.. at least for me it was. It's one of those rare films that come along bringing back the 'movie magic'. The realism of the tsunami and destruction kept me in awe throughout the whole film. I would really say it has indeed earned it's share of Academy Award nominations - especially for sound editing and mixing. I never really pay attention to the sound quality in much films but in this one (also because of it's nature) it really outshines.I really wished there would have been more character development though before the disaster. Because of this, I really couldn't connect with the characters as much as I wanted to. Even though halfway through you do, but not with much background on them.Overall it's a great movie, perfect acting from the whole cast. Definitely a 'must see movie', it keeps you interested throughout.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Realistic portrayal of  Disaster.......,"This is an excellent movie about the tsunami disaster of 2004 concentrating on the experiences of one family. Mum, Dad and 3 kids arrive on a Thai island for what ought to be a wonderful Xmas holiday; instead disaster strikes and this film is a real tear jerker. Who will survive, if any, and where are they?! From my own knowledge and research and what I recall, the tragedy of the tsunami is accurately shown in the film. At the time of the tsunami I was in another part of Thailand about 1 hour by jet away from where it hit, yet I could still feel the after shock of it. The movie is superbly yet horrifically presented and the children in the picture give the stand out performances especially the actor Tom Holland. The family are portrayed in the movie as British, but in real life were Spanish, yet the change in nationality is justified in telling this story. Deserves a high rating:8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,History

While this movie is so very hard to watch, you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen. This is an emotional roller coaster ride with an incredible cast lead by Naomi Watts in what can only be described as not only Oscar worthy, but in my humble yet accurate opinion the very best lead actress role of the nominated actresses.

More about a relationship than a Tsunami !,"The movie was more about the relationship between a mother and her eldest son .Her young son steps up and looks after his mum and ensures that she survives . It had a couple of moments that were quite moving .Tom Holland who played the eldest son was brilliant ! Watts bizarrely looked like Nicole Kidman and even copied her style of acting! She was wasn't bad but I kept thinking that I was watching Nicole Kidman! . Btw Watch out at the beginning the movie's a bit gory!The effects of the actual Tsunami before it hit were visually poor . It did not capture the enormity of the Tsunami . The after effects shown weren't great either . I'm sure there was much more devastation than shown .The hospital was shown to being very dirty , including the mattresses . It was the usual cliche ! In fact Thai hospitals are not dirty . They are very clean. Some Thai hospitals are of a very high standard. They are of a much better standard than any of the private hospitals in the UK and Europe. ( I've been in hospital in Thailand!)As others have said the movie did not show the suffering of the Thai people at all . We didn't even see any badly injured Thai people . It appeared as though only White Tourists were badly hurt and suffered !The saddest part of the movie was that it focused solely on the privileged White tourists . I found this very disrespectful to the hundreds of thousands of Thai people injured and dead in the Tsunami .The movie tried too hard to pull at the viewer's heart strings .

An emotional tsunami of the heart,"There are scenes in The Impossible that could have happened in any situation any of us have experienced. The volcano of bottled up emotions coming out in bubbling tears when finally speaking words of a tragedy is one that I think is most universal. It is this every persons' perspective that works so well in this film about people caught in the wort disaster of our lifetime. Every decision after the initial catastrophe seems so crucial to life and death, yet each is made for logical reasons after fighting the initial instincts. The reward is The Impossible, but the experience is what the film is about. Naomi Watts is quite a powerhouse of an actress when called upon, and Tom Holland, as her eldest son, is phenomenal in his portrayal of a young boy forced into a caretaker role (not what young boys do best) and in roaming about the hospital doing whatever he can for his family and for others. There is also the Thai communities that are shown as caring and giving despite their own horrendous situations, either in the village or feared as they worked non-stop in the hospital. While you want to declare this true family story as lucky and/or valiant, it seems meant to be more of a family amalgam for all of us to see the easily felt message of family and living in the now... who knows what tomorrow may bring.",8.0,Anonymous,History

The mood setting and atmosphere generating techniques utilized in this film were excellent. The acting performances and believable emotion between characters are almost unequaled.

The film then provides the answer to what is important in any situation in life, love.The story itself cannot really be judged critically as it is a true story, although it would have been one of the best ever written had it have been a human who wrote the story.

Completely misses the mark,"To make a movie such as this that tackles the real life disaster of the 2004 tsunami is no small task. It took the lives of so many and even for those of us around the world that weren't there or were fortunate enough to not have any loved ones involved, it still never leaves you. I remember the devastation and disbelief of seeing it on the news just as I remember the day of the 9/11 attacks. Disasters like that are cemented in all of our consciousnesses for the rest of our lives.It's a fantastic take on the sheer devastation and shock that the people present that day must've experienced. It felt so real in places that it felt I was watching a documentary rather than a movie. The way the tsunami itself was filmed was incredible as were the reactions of the family at the centre of it all.However, none of this stops the movie from being dull. I understand that many will appreciate this movie because of what it is about and for being a realistic and honest depiction of it, but there's simply no entertainment value. There's no story, nothing to get invested in. The movie follows the same family of five from beginning to end which should have made it more impactful, but unfortunately, it didn't. Whilst the family's pain and shock was understandable and I could imagine the horror of being in that exact situation myself, I simply wasn't invested in them to the extent I should've been.Personally, I think this movie would have been a hundred times better if it was told from the perspective of the locals of Khao Lak. Although there were many Thai characters involved in the movie, it would've been even more emotional for it to be told by them. Whilst the British family we followed were physically and mentally impacted by the disaster, the reality is they could jump on a plane at the end, go home and move on with their lives. It was the local people who had their entire lives destroyed and had to pick up the pieces. Why not tell us that story instead? It seems that the filmmakers felt the only way to tell and interesting or relatable story was to tell it from an English-speaking white family's perspective, which makes no sense to me.I haven't seen any other movies based upon the 2004 tsunami, so perhaps there are already such movies out there that exist, but I still strongly believe this should have focused on the locals rather than a British family.Furthermore, although the ending was as happy as it could have been it was very unrealistic and it would've added to the authenticity of the movie if it had a different ending.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Moving,"You can't go wrong with this movie. It's emotion and heartwarming. I believe that the beginning of the movie is where it shines.

The suspense that is built at the beginning is great, you know that there will be a tsunami but you keep waiting for it to actually happen and when it does it is so terrifying and shocking. The realism of the movie is really what makes it stand out form any other natural disaster movie, the gore is so disgusting and makes you tremble, the wreckages look like they are right on front of you.

Nature at it's worst,"(2012) The Impossible
DRAMABased on the accounts accordingly to the person who's actually lived it, by the name of María Belón. The movie which stars Naomi Watts plays Maria, vacationing with her husband, Henry (Ewan McGregor) and their 3 kids along with other families, who also chose to spend their Christmas vacation on one of few vacation spots in Thailand. And it's not long that the 'tsunami' begins to happen, which is when the ""real movie"" starts, since viewers are only aware of the impact and destruction, without fully knowing what it's like to be in it, for the director makes it very clear that a tsunami breaks families apart once together, and that the film is really about the reunification- not the closure. And that the devastation is not the same as a house fire, since the wrecking environment is way too huge, for it extends to many football fields. We already know that the main characters are going to come together, but in what circumstances and to what obstacles, for it acts as if it were telling this amazing story to me. This tsunami acts like a stream of water, eroding onto a beach except these are huge and much bigger, a colossal stream absorbing everything on it's path, like you're on a fast current river,except that the debris is everywhere from trees, to vehicles to tables. And since we're already invested in this particular family, we are wondering whether or not they can all be reunited again, as many other families are experiencing the exact same problem for the film is about hope. It's easy to make a film about the dead, except that it doesn't really go anywhere, it is however, hard to make a film about them when it's defined by it's performances, and they're some of the best I had ever seen, particularly Naomi Watts and the families oldest son, Lucas played by Tom Holland. And it's Ewan McGregor's best work he has ever done, since ""Trainspotting"". Some of the negative criticism I had read seems like they wanted the film to go on a different direction, as if they're only aware of it without experiencing it for themselves as if it'll never happen to them. And I find that this is a much harder film to work on, in comparison to other catastrophe films coming from catastrophe director Roland Emmerich just because it actually happened as opposed to something that is entirely made up. I only wish that there were more actual survival stories like this, since it doesn't have anything to do with politics. They also provide viewers a little bit of awareness of what one would have to do if something like this ever happens again.",8.0,Anonymous,History
J.A.Bayona and Sergio G. Sanchez make The Impossible Possible,"This film told the story of a family that lived through the deadly Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami of 2004 that struck fourteen countries - one of them being Thailand, where this story takes place. It hit the day after Christmas without warning, killing and injuring many. From the exceptional acting to the life like scenes, this film was able to draw the audience in and make them feel as if they were experiencing the disaster first-hand. Within the first 20 minutes, producers J.A. Bayona and Sergio G. Sanchez caught my attention. They started the plot off with a seemingly happy family, who is excited to be leaving for a Christmas vacation. After they arrived at their destination in Thailand, the plot twists and the tsunami hits the resort at which they are staying. At this point the whole movie changes as the family is separated and hurt due to the disaster that struck. They are now fighting for their lives while trying to be reunited. Before the tsunami scene, there wasn't much to the film. After and during, however; the film completely changed and kept me engaged and wanting to know what would happen next. Overall I think that the film and filmmakers did an excellent job at recreating such a devastating event, especially how it affected one family in particular. They showed the daily struggles that the family faced during the days following, while also showing how the locals coped. Remaking scenes that almost seem impossible to recreate. This made the film more credible and interesting. During the tsunami scene, it seemed as if a real tsunami was there, not a fake one used for filming. From the rumbling, shaking, and sudden quietness, to the sheer terror on peoples' faces as a giant wall of water hit the resort along with the running and yelling of people as they began to realize what was happening. From that scene on, it was everything that I imagined it would be. The drowning scene made me feel as if I was actually drowning. The occasional black out of the screen helped with the effects too – it was like a screen of death and made me wonder if they were actually dying. The acting by Naomi Watts, Ewan McGreggor, and Tom Holland throughout the film was exceptional. From the beginning when the tsunami first struck and the family was separated and injured, while they were struggling to stay alive and find each other, to the end when they were reunited. They brought real, raw emotions to the screen that made it seem as if it were actually real. This film is sure to leave you feeling emotional. It has you hoping for the best, but also knowing that it might get worse. It makes you want to hug your family and remind them of how much you love them. All-in-all I thought that this film was really good and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a thriller drama and wants to shed a few tears.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Remarkable story of celebrating struggles,"The kid says, ""I am scared"", mother whispers in his ear, ""I am scared too son"". Having gone through the devastation of tsunami and having lost the family in destruction, perhaps, being scared was the only option left. Or not! The Impossible collects threads from all the lives and connects them to form strong bonds - of support, of love, of smiles in despair, of beaten yet strong enthusiasm, of innocent courage, of broken happiness, of countless tears and of human spirit. Cinema is a powerful medium. One could choose to create something that contributes in making lives beautiful or choose to create something meaningless or just ""entertaining"". Both have their places but unfortunately the latter has a more prominent presence. This movie chooses to reemphasize that every moment has many lives present in it and the beauty is in recognizing and celebrating all of them at all the times.

All I Managed Was The 1st 5 Minutes - Realizing it Was Like Drinking Saccharine....,"Tsunami hits, 240k people die, let's make a movie about the rich British family who suffer horrible trauma (injuries! Non permanent, tho...separation! For a few days...fatigue! Dirt!) and who manage, somehow, to piece their lives back together once reunited, whisked by private plane covered by insurance to Singapore for medical care, then home to UK to resume their luxe little lives. OK, good for them, comes of living in the 1st world, having tons of disposable income, etc. But it makes for a boring movie, which it shouldn't have been since it's based on real events. I kept waiting to FEEL something, at least something other than wow! At the special effects. A much more interesting focus would be to delve into the lives of some of the local populace, the ones not-so-rich, not-so-white, no-so-insured. The ones, say, who lost homes, families, communities, livelihoods, health, virtually EVERYTHING that matters, and somehow neglected to have some Zurich-based insurance company covering all misfortunes. That scenario happened too, for real - and in numbers vastly surpassing the Tourist Trauma that is all this pricey film appears to care about.

Beautiful,"amazing story about how a family is just so torn apart... It really let's you feel how caring people are in situations like this. Sad how people actually go through an ordeal such as this. Loved it. Loved the characters, the way everyone helps one another, and the family. I was rooting for them the entire way, I just couldn't sleep. It feels impossible that this happens but somehow we felt it. If your deciding whether to watch it, do it. You won't regret it. I admit the beginning was just whatever. However when the disaster strikes, i was like a fish on a hook. Lots of stuff were accurate such as the patterns before something like that hits. Also the setting and the locals just made it that more realistic. Didn't feel like I was watching the movie.. it felt more like I was a part of the whole Odyssey. Loved it. A+",10.0,Anonymous,History

A Beautiful Story...,"Firstly let me say no other movie about a natural disaster unsettled me as much as this one. It fully captured the effect and the aftermath of this terrible event.I really found no problem with this movie. I had to wipe my eyes from time to time, thanks to the raw and passionate performances the actors gave.It is the story about a family torn apart by a tsunami that hit the eats coast of Asia in the year 2004 and how they desperately try to get back together again. With overwhelming odds and obstacles we can only imagine they find there way back to each other.In the end we can learn many things from this experience, but one stands out the most. That we should treasure each other whenever we can and we should never allow anything to get in the way of that. Be thankful for the people in your life because they can be taken away at any moment. If you have someone or something to live for you need to know that that something is worth fighting for.A beautiful story that had me captivated from beginning to the end. I couldn't take my eyes off the damn thing!",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Emotional, heartbreaking and terrifyingly real.","Based on a true story, The Impossible is an adaptation of what a family of five had to endure during one of the most devastating natural disasters to occur in our time. Maria (Naomi Watts), Henry (Ewan McGregor) and their three sons take a trip to Thailand for the festive holidays. Following Christmas day the family spend time at the hotel swimming pool not expecting what's to come. Once the tsunami hits they are split in half not knowing if they have all survived. Only hope and the will to live is what pushes them to believe that somehow they will find each other.I will say straight away that this film doesn't fail to pack a punch emotionally. It's intentionally powerful and so it should be for such an amazing story. it's nothing short of a miracle what the family had accomplished after such a catastrophic event and it's a story that needs to be told. There are a lot of encouraging and powerful themes explored in this film which can drive anyone to inspiration. It shows how heroes can come in any shape and sizes and all it can take is a simple touch to say everything is going to be fine to heighten someone's spirits.This film for me holds two of the most powerful scenes of 2012. The opening scenes where the tsunami hits the hotel is both terrifying and realistic that your heart can't stop pounding. I felt emotions stronger than any other film that I've watched before, there was a genuine fear and realisation about how vulnerable and alone you are in such a disaster. Recreating that event to the level of realism they had is pretty amazing, and it's hard not to appreciate that scene. The second scene was with Ewan McGregor where he calls his father-in-law to tell him their situation. I've not seen a moment in a film as intense as that this year, the amount of emotion he puts into it is infectious and if you don't feel just a little emotional then you are obviously too manly for this film.Performances from everyone needed to be intense and inevitably they were with such an awesome cast. I've missed seeing Ewan Mcgregor on the big screen, and he really proves how much of a talent he is. Props also going to the three kids, couldn't have been easy parts to play but they got through it convincingly. Lastly Naomi Watts easily steals the show with such a devastating performance, capturing probably every emotion you could get in such a situation, and at the age of 44 it's amazing how young she looks.The only negative I could find with this film is that it didn't seem to explore the people who weren't so fortunate to find their families, there was a lack of tribute to the unlucky individuals. I can easily see where people could get easily offended, especially if they were victims of the tsunami or a similar disaster. Admittedly it could have really done with it towards the end because it became quite evident that they lost things to film and it ultimately played out the sentimental tone a bit too long. All in all, an amazing story told well through the media of film.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Overrated,"I didn't expect much from this movie based on the trailer, and also because this type of movie is somewhat ""predictable by nature""... It tells the story of one family becoming a victim of the 2004 tsunami in South-East Asia. The film didn't even meet my modest expectations.The main problem with this film is that it does little more than tell the story of exactly one family. Little attention is given to everyone else, which is mind boggling given the magnitude of the catastrophe. Even some members of the family are left out a little bit, and the movie concentrates mainly on few characters.The other problem is that the film is too slow-paced and boring. It should have been cut much shorter or even better there should be more content.One weird thing is that there is not much death to be seen in this movie, but still the amount of gore is plenty, courtesy of mostly one main character.",4.0,Anonymous,History
A beautifully made disaster film with a wonderful story of family and hope that far surpasses in every way any other film that has previously tried accomplish the same thing.,"This is a great international production with a great story and cast. I do believe that they put a great deal of effort into not only researching the facts of these kinds of disasters but then also implementing that research and making the film look totally accurate and strikingly beautiful, if that can be said of a disaster film. They finely honed their script and it payed off in bundles. The acting is absolutely perfect and the story is pitch perfect. It's captivating and sucks you in from the first frame to the last. This is a film everyone should watch it's that good.

Not the holiday they'd planned...,"There is a word for this film, which is based around the great tsunami which killed so many people in Thailand at the end of 2004, and that would be 'harrowing'. If it's not the sight of graphic injuries infected by dirty water, there's also traumatised people looking for their loved ones, dead bodies being fished out by the score... BUT as a celebration of the human spirit, it is absolutely fantastic. If this story really is as true as they make us believe, the family involved are a true credit to society. Despite being badly hurt, and losing each other in the aftermath of the storm, they stop to help others and try to make a difference in whatever small way they can. More individuals like this in the world please, and less of the Katie Prices and Joey Essexes.It puts you on a ride early on, as first we are introduced to this perfect couple with three sons celebrating Christmas. only to see them torn apart in a brilliant special sequence which brings home the true horror of the occasion. Then, as we follow their journeys in the chaos of what followed, the true gravity of what has occurred is brought to life through the eyes of thousands of devastated relatives and friends, each desperate for news. It is a gripping account of desolation amidst tragedy, but as long as there is hope you can never give up... And each time somebody is reunited with their child, or has their life saved by an overworked medical staff, it feels like a major triumph. The film puts puts you through an emotional wringer, but my... is it worth it. Brilliant, life affirming stuff. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
Khao Lak,"An emotional rollercoaster that captures the intensity and devastation of the disaster, as well as the incredible resilience and strength of the human spirit. Naomi Watts delivers an outstanding performance as Maria, capturing the character's fear, pain, and determination in the face of unimaginable circumstances. Tom Holland also shines as Lucas, conveying the character's maturity and bravery beyond his years.The cinematography in ""The Impossible"" is breathtaking, with the stunning scenery of Thailand serving as both a beautiful backdrop and a terrifying force of destruction.

A Cinematic Triumph,"""The Impossible"" masterfully captures the human spirit's resilience in the face of overwhelming disaster. Directed by J. A. Bayona, this film is a testament to the power of hope and the indomitable will to survive.Set against the backdrop of the catastrophic 2004 tsunami, ""The Impossible"" tells the harrowing tale of the Bennett family, who are caught in one of the worst natural disasters in history while vacationing in Thailand. The film is a visceral experience that plunges the audience into the chaos and terror of the tsunami, yet it's the family's desperate search for each other amidst the devastation that truly grips the heart.Naomi Watts delivers a powerhouse performance as Maria, the matriarch of the Bennett family, showcasing a range of emotions that are both raw and deeply moving. Ewan McGregor's portrayal of Henry, the devoted father, is equally compelling, as he brings a nuanced depth to a character driven by the singular goal of reuniting his family.However, it is the young actors who truly shine in ""The Impossible."" Tom Holland, in particular, delivers a breakout performance as Lucas, the eldest son. His portrayal of a boy thrust into premature adulthood is both convincing and heart-wrenching. The young actors bring a remarkable authenticity to their roles, capturing the innocence and courage of children navigating through unimaginable circumstances.""The Impossible"" is not just a story of survival; it's a poignant exploration of the human condition. It's a film that will leave you with a profound sense of gratitude for life's fragility and the unexpected moments of kindness that can emerge from tragedy. It's a tearjerker, indeed, but one that ultimately reaffirms the strength of family bonds and the enduring nature of love.""The Impossible"" is a beautifully crafted film that is both emotionally charged and visually stunning.

Mawkish Maudlin Movie,"mawkish adj. 1. Excessively and objectionably sentimental. 2. Sickening or insipid in taste.To describe The Impossible as mawkish is like calling Joe Pesci's character in Goodfellas ""not nice"".The Impossible is one family's story of survival in the aftermath of the tsunami that struck Thailand on Boxing Day in 2004. The special effects used to recreate the tsunami are very impressive. I was saying ""Wow"" at that point of the movie. As the film progressed, I found myself saying ""Wow"" in a different manner; while rolling my eyes in disbelief at the acting and dialog. Based on that, a better title for this flick would have been The Implausible.The screenplay is by Sergio G. Sánchez from María Belón's story. Belón is the woman portrayed in the film by Naomi Watts. Since the writers were Spanish, we can only hope that something was lost in translation since I hardly believed any of the characters' words.Watts does a decent job in the lead role, and it's a credit to her that she succeeds even to that extent, considering the direction and writing. Other actors don't fare as well. Tom Holland, who plays her son Lucas, shows some promise as an actor, but here he mostly comes off as an overly sentimental caricature. The other main character is the father portrayed by Ewan McGregor. McGregor's ""acting"" consists mainly of looking anguished in blood-smear makeup while screaming out the names of his family members.Director Juan Antonio Bayona has decided that the best way to convey the hardship and emotions experienced by the poor souls who suffered through this ordeal is to show closeups of their faces to the accompaniment of some Williamsesque music done to the nth degree. I could just imagine John Williams (a.k.a. The Big Schmaltzy) sitting in a theater where this was playing, wincing and saying, ""Eww, too much music.""I have to say that I felt a little uncomfortable while watching this movie. Here was a real and devastating tragedy, and I was feeling as much emotion as I do when I watch my computer run a virus scan. Those who suffered through this catastrophe deserve to have their stories told with dignity and gravitas. At the very least they deserve more than this uninspired and maudlin celluloid effort.",4.0,Anonymous,History
A heart wrenching affair that is planted in the hope of a new tommorrow.,"It is a severe thought provoking movie intricately cohered by brilliant acting by the cast especially Naomi Watts and Tom Holland.
Once you start your venture, you will lose track of the goosebumps and tears that will ease their way out of you. Good direction, beautiful cinematography especially the scenes portraying symbolism, a neatly compiled script and a suitably coordinating background score are the supporting pillars behind this gem. I don't know on what grounds they refrained from giving the Academy award (2013) to Naomi Watts because this is going down as her best.
People complaining about weak script fail to comprehend the meticulous use of symbolism in the movie. To them it's just another cliched flick with a happy ending. But at times it is more important to look into the box rather than just appreciating the gift wrap

The movie says it is a true story and if all of it is true and not embellished for Hollywood, it really seems impossible. It's about a couple and their 3 kids whom are in the tsunami in Thailand and their survival. First, I thought the special effects showing the rushing water and waves hitting were really good. I have no idea how they made it look so realistic. I don't know how anyone could not have drowned being in the rushing water with objects flying around.Then the rest of the movie is about the family coming together and finding each other in chaos.

I would have liked some more character development in the beginning to get to know the family better but glad it wasn't too drawn out. I also would have liked to see the big wave come in from the beach as that was left out. After reading reviews, I found many people upset that it didn't cover the amount of how many people suffered but I thought it did except to say when Maria and Lucas were in the tree I would think there would be more bodies around and so wondered about that.

A Family Survival Story,"The Impossible is based on a true story about the devastating tsunami in Thailand. Many might wonder why is the film's focused victims are tourist families. Are they trying to let the audience relate to the characters since most moviegoers are probably like the leads of the film? That is my only theory, so far. At glance, it looks like a light sentimental family drama but it is surprisingly disturbingly tragic. It is surrounded by darkness and endless emotions, the overall experience is stirring and depressing. It serves an excellent direction and outstanding performances. The film can be heartwarming but it never avoids showing the most horrifying parts of the incident.It's intriguing to know about what happened to the other victims but the movie is really about one of the families who survived from the tsunami. They are the point of view that deals with their own situations, though they get to explore around and help other people. It is ought to be a life changing journey that would inspire many, but no matter what, it didn't gloss over the terrible aftermath. It still shows the violence and the disaster that can be pretty hard to stomach to watch. The film is generally about hope and love of family. Most of the victims they show are parents and children who are looking for their missing love ones and won't give up until they find them. I guess that's the whole point of it. It leaves being intriguing to what happened to the rest of the tragedy.The acting is exceptional enough to settle this journey. Naomi Watts gives such an endearing performance. She carries her character's pain and struggle which easily makes us care about her. Ewan McGregor also brings some real sympathy to his character. The rest keeps it compelling as well, especially young Tom Holland who shines in his role. In the filmmaking side, the direction is magnificent. The scene when they are trying to swim through the floods is amazingly crafted. It provides a lot of suspense and tension which enhances more to the experience than just showing off emotions. In other parts, it all looks decent.The Impossible didn't forget about the heartbreaking realities of the events. It's fortunately not one of those true stories that makes it all light for a safer family fare. This film is actually good for the family even if it gets pretty sad and violent. Well, that is what that incident really is, but even though everything may seem hopeless, there will always be that powerful love that will motivate someone to have the courage to reunite their love back. That is probably the only point of the story and we could deal with that. It still concerns about the land that was destroyed by the tsunami. Too bad there isn't enough information about it. Overall, The Impossible is a spectacularly compelling cinematic experience.",8.0,Anonymous,History
The Amazing Race,"The Impossible itself is a remarkable story of human survival. It starts with an ordinary family, an ordinary couple, an ordinary getaway from their time- consuming life to enjoy with their children. But just right at the moment you think life could be perfect for once, the possible disaster crush and shatter that fanciful picture. The next 100 minutes of the movie demonstrate the family's journey, bringing us from agony to ecstasy. One of the fragments to create such success for the movie is definitely the acting of Naomi Watts, Ewan McGregor and newbie Tom Holland. It is very sophisticated to see the oxymoron between the two parents. The mentally strength is rooted in a feminine form. The mother (Watts) incredibly overcomes the physical pain with bravery, determination and survival skills. In the other hand, we see the extreme emotional side of the father (McGregor) that could make you knees go weak. Undoubtedly this movie marks the finest performance of Ewan McGregor since Moulin Rouge. The child actors are amazing, especially Tom Holland, who we can see growing up throughout the film. Surprisingly, the movie is not miserable at all, it reflects hope and family value which keep the family members going strong and fighting firm for their lives.",10.0,Anonymous,History

They cashed in on a disaster; they didn't even do it well,"This was utterly torturous. I'll keep it short and not so sweet, last time I tried my phone turned off deleting my progress so I'm even more enraged, this film is just determined to ruin my day.
I hated all the acting, especially from that one woman I can't remember the name of who was in King Kong (which seems like Pulp Fiction when compared to whatever this was) who's method acting consists of fake crying and standing there looking bored. Ewan McGregor was also pretty bad but that's nothing new is it. Tom Holland was.... there.
The characters were the embodiment of pretentious. Ah yes let's take our kids on a holiday to Thailand just because we can afford it. I mean, kids enjoy most holidays because they don't understand the concept of 5 star hotels or money. Well I'm pretty sure they'd have enjoyed a trip to a slaughterhouse more than this.
It's pretty lame too how they cashed in on a tragic disaster which killed a LOT of people. I can think of at least a hundred better ways of executing this theme as a movie. The acting only made it more offensive to the actual victims of the tsunami.
Nothing made any sense at all in this dumpster fire. I'm pretty sure if you get knocked out under water in a bloody tsunami you most likely will die. Not this family. Of course KKW (King Kong woman) is absolutely fine with half her leg hanging off, after all, there are no nerves that could possibly be damaged, no tendons severed, no bones broken, no bleeding to death. That would just make too much sense.
I walked out of this film because of how stupid it was, I can't stand disaster films because you can guarantee the acting and characters will be bog standard and the acting will be even worse. The characters were so vacuous that I couldn't root for them, I just wanted the nightmare to end.
I couldn't even be bothered to waste anymore time remembering their names. I've seen some pretty awful films, but even Tommy Wiseau's The Room didn't make me feel this type of rage. At least you could laugh at that. There is no relief in The Impossible.

Extremely moving and sympathetic account of what really happened.,"Having just watched this film, I felt compelled to leave a review and also to highlight the ignorance of some of the people who have posted ""bad"" reviews of this film. I was one of the lucky few that escaped with my life from the Tsunami, sadly my partner was not. I was therefore unsure whether I wanted to watch a film that would depict the day in which my life changed forever. I am, however, extremely pleased that I did as what I have just watched was an extremely powerful, moving and sympathetic film. I would however like to highlight the ignorance of one such reviewer, ""yipiha"" posted on 18 Dec 2013....Running away in silence is somewhat out of the question.... Oh how I would have loved it if I was able to run away or not scream! When the Tsunami hit where I was staying, I had about 5 secs to try and understand what this huge black wall rapidly approaching actually was. It was traveling at 500 mph and was 20 foot high so the actual impact was similar to having been hit by a jet plane.After saving themselves, the mother and eldest boy climb a tree. Why? Well I would have thought this was self-explanatory.... Having just been hit by a huge wave and not understanding what a tsunami was (I mean how many people honestly knew what a tsunami was until it happened), everyone that I encountered didn't know whether there would be another one so we all scrambled to the highest point possible, whether that be up a tree, up a mountain or onto the roof of a hotel until we were certain that there were no more waves, in my case this was almost 24 hours.The oldest son loses his mother twice in the hospital... This highlighted the fact that the hospitals were totally ill-equipped to cope with a disaster of this magnitude. During those first 48 hours after being rescued, I was twice taken down to the mortuary to identify a body (neither of which were my partner). I was then found by my father who had traveled to Phuket when he had heard what happened, where he saw on one of the hundreds of missing people boards that I had been found and was in hospital in Phuket, when I was actually in hospital in Krabi some 100 miles away. There was total confusion everywhere as the authorities tried unsuccessfully to keep a hand on what was going on. With over 5500 confirmed dead, 8000 reportedly missing and over 10,000 injured in Thailand alone, surely you can imagine the chaos that was going on.I could go on but I feel I have made my point. Yes, I think it was still too soon for a film to be made of this disaster and be portrayed as ""entertainment"", but I also think that it was done with the utmost respect to those that did lose their husbands/wives/families. The reality of the situation really hit home and I have since urged all those around me to see it as I believe it is the most accurate portrayal of what actually happened I have ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Upon awaking on the 26th I logged online to read emails and had received a notice there was a posting to my Yahoo Group. The post was from a friend who lived in Phuket, and he had said strangely he decided to go have breakfast in the city instead of his usual place by the ocean. A few minutes into the tuktuk ride he received a text message to return because a horrible disaster had occurred, so he had the driver turn around. As he was returning he passed the usual restaurant seeing that everything was gone...umbrellas, tables, motorcycles, most of the building, trees...all gone where just minutes before it had all been there. His life was saved by mere minutes because he chose something different that day.So when I first watched this movie all those memories flooded back, and I cried. This movie was spot-on! And Tom Holland's performance was most definitely the best part. I had forgotten he was one of the actors, and watching how perfectly he displayed emotions had me bawling repeatedly. It really was his break-out role, and I can only applaud this young man's performance as he has given us so much to enjoy in the movie industry, just like this movie. It's powerful, gripping, and tells a true story of the horror this one family, plus hundreds of thousands more endured, not to mention the over 230,000 who lost their lives across the countries along the ocean.",9.0,Anonymous,History
a great movie,"A tragic account of a family trying to get reunited after their vacation spot was hit by a tsunami. The movie focuses on the aftermath of a catastrophic event, where the viewer follows the main characters through their terrifying experiences in this unexpected situation, which, seen from afar, thousands of miles away, from the comfort and safety of our houses, in the news, may not look as painful as it is to a life living every second of it. Often, in circumstances like these, individual stories can get lost in the mass tragedy, and movies like this can help bring them forward.The only thing which I, personally, did not like was the cookie cutter ending, which does not reflect the most relevant stories that could be told here. Otherwise, a good rating, it was well done, I felt the pain of the characters with every step, and winced at their suffering. I also need to mention that the dream-like scene where the woman emerges out of water was absolutely exceptional! If you watch this movie, you'll know which one. A good choice of movie.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Best movie I've seen in years !,"Its currently 2021 and I totally missed this one, until now. I don't know how. It's fantastic! Aside from having lots of great footage/special effects of a tsunami wave, it's also told /delivered in an excellent way. ALL the stars are fantastic in their roles and they 'knock you for a loop' time after time with every HIT of the story because they really make you feel the shock and awe and heart wrenching traumas. Who ever did the film fit~ it together masterfully. (I'm serious.) The way the events happened are tied IN with the story creatively, and in a way that 'connects the dots' with real SKILL (its subtle, but smacks you right in the head. Like I said, real SKILL).Every single actor in the movie delivers very, VERY well. How often can you say that ? This movie really impressed me. You will not be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,History
overemotive direction,"The one thing this film really needed was a connection with the family. I just didn't feel it at all. I just didn't care. Someone else who reviewed this film suggested it was 'white-centric' and you could be forgiven for thinking this. Of course if it had been made by thais about thais the audience would be non existent outside asia. As it is they changed the nationality of the original family from Spanish to English probably for the same reason; but we should expect this and go with it.No, the real problem is I just didn't care about the family, especially the way over the top hysterics of Ewan McGregor. The thing that pulled this movie up from 1 to 3 for me was the children, especially 'Luke'. In a glib by the book TV movie format they were surprisingly natural and Luke was the only actor who showed any real talent and grew with the story.Overall this was a poor trivialisation of an horrific tragedy.",3.0,Anonymous,History
"Good story, GREAT acting, really hard to get through","Rarely ever do I feel nauseous while watching movies (and I watch tons of war movies), but The Impossible nearly made me throw up twice. There's so much blood, gore, and pain- the first 40 minutes were nearly impossible to get through.However, I stuck through it and am glad I did. Underneath all the grime and gore, it was a true and incredible story of survival and a beautiful study of human life. Tom Holland really shines through as the eldest son, Lucas, and by the end of it I was near tears.Overall, if gore and tons of blood doesn't bother you, watch it. And if they do... it might be best to steer clear.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"A real story (but, sorry, i was bored)","A real story and a realistic adaption, it is indeed. The quiet vacation in the marvelous beach is very relaxing and reliable, i almost phoned this hotel to order a room. The play is quiet well, the kids are cute as honey, and the life of common people in our rushing planet are shown on screen in simple and direct way. The catastrophe that comes without any warning is also very real. The fear and shock, the hope and despair are well transferred to audience, and in some way i was a bit tensed to see whether things goes more badly, or happy ending is coming.BUT, there are two points that made me sad: The first is that in overall this film was boring, like the chewing gum that has lost it's taste. There was a drama, but the director missed something. The second problem is with the unnecessary semi-nude moments that didn't contribute anything to the story. Nothing would happen if these seconds won't be in this film, maybe some people like me would even like it better.",5.0,Anonymous,History
very powerful,"This film is based on a true story of a family's experience in the tsunami in southern Asia in December, 2004 during a visit to Thailand.The film is a Spanish production made in the English language. The family whose experience is the basis of the film is Spanish but in the film, they are depicted as English. Possibly, this decision had the intention of drawing in more English-speaking viewers. Although this decision might reduce the authenticity of the film, the consolation is magnificent performances by Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor as the parents and some great child performances - especially from Tom Holland.""The Impossible"" takes on the major challenge of dealing with one of the greatest natural disasters in history that is in recent memory for many. For the most part, it succeeds quite well.The family bonding at the beginning is well set up to connect the audience with the main characters but without getting overly sentimental. The tsunami itself was very powerfully filmed, creating a very gripping experience. Credit must go to director Juan Antonio Bayona and his special effects team.The aerial shots of the crowd scenes during the aftermath also showed great skill on Bayona's part. The only flaw is that the scenes seem to show little or no hardship of the local Thais; they seem to concentrate mainly on the tourists. Hopefully, another film can expose the plight of Asian residents during and after this disaster. But, as an account of one family's experience, ""The Impossible"" does a superb job. - dbamateurcritic",8.0,Anonymous,History
A family tries to survive the tsunami that rocked Asia.,"I've watched this movie twice on television. The first time, I was sobbing as the family was ripped apart. I don't want to spoil anything for anyone who hasn't seen it. The second time I watched it, I was focused on the strength of the mother and, in particular, the oldest son, Lucas. He was still a child but held it together with remarkable strength. This showed through at the very end of the movie, which I will not explain because it will ruin it for those yet to see it. His character was one of heart, of real emotions as was Ewan McGregor's character. The tears were so real, the pain so great for this family-- one of many who were killed, injured, traumatized and whose lives were totally altered by the experience. Ironically, several decades ago, I had a dream about waves as tall as buildings going straight up and straight down while I sat on the beach with friends. This movie forced me to recall that dream and rethink its meaning.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A relatable disaster movie,"Heart-pounding cinematic journey that sweeps you into the chaos of the 2004 tsunami. Directed by J. A. Bayona, this film follows a family's harrowing struggle for survival and reunion amidst the devastation. Naomi Watts delivers an Oscar-worthy performance as a mother battling both the sea and her own despair. The visuals are breathtaking, making you feel every wave crash against your emotions. It's a rollercoaster of hope and heartbreak that will leave you gripping your seat and reaching for the tissues. Grab some popcorn, but be ready for an emotional ride!

Better than expected,"I checked it out Sunday afternoon on Netflix.
I thought before it will take a while until something happens but I was wrong. It started quick just after the movie began with a nonstop hell ride with never seen great special effects. It was better than I have expected. Especially the little boys played very good their roles.
A very emotional story based on true events created lot of tears for me and my wife. This disaster film is no doubt a must see.

I am 22 this year and I remember clearly when this event happened and when the tsunami hit. It was a big deal especially in Aisa, however, when I told my friends about this movie a lot of them seem to not remember or didn't even know about the tsunami that happened. I was very shocked because I thought that it was such a big global disaster so I wonder if a lot of people know about this event before it this movie? I was so baffled by it.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Extremely emotional and not for the faint at heart,"This account is as honest is it could be from the perspective of 1 family on whatever they encountered during the 2004 Natural Disaster and all the aftermath in terms of first aid for the victims and the heart breaking incidents of viewing others in pain.The film tries to focus on the one family amongst the harsh reality of the situation. an extremely emotional movie that cannot leave you unaffected and thankful for the things we have .There was just one item that I would have liked included - the perspective of time - like day 1 , day 2 etc. which could have helped the audience feel the pain more deeply than it currently does . .",9.0,Anonymous,History
An insult,"Awful. An insult to the people that suffered through the actual event.
I usually like Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor but not in this film, using unknown Spanish actors would have suited better, of course we can see why they chose such well known actors, it just seemed disrespectful to glamourise it with Hollywood bull crap. Over acted and an embarrassment in my opinion.
I give this three stars, Tom Holland, the extras and the special effects during the first part of the film. Such a shame as it could have been a very effective film over all.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Movie about being prevailed,"This feels like a movie about previlage where one western/white family (who is apparently broke to begin with as they show them discussing
bad financial situation in the beginning) takes a vacation to a Thai resort, get hit by a massive tsunami and then in the end get a huge PRIVATE jet (assuming insurance with their governments help?) to fly the sick heroine to the best hospital in all of Asia located in Singapore, with just this ONE family in the entire HUGE aeroplane, while millions of other under previlaged tourists and locals are dying and rotting. I really hope this is not entirely a true story because it's sickening to watch the selective entitlement and previlage bestowed only to certain group. While I am glad the female protoganist got help, its almost leaves you with a bad taste with overly dramatic heroism depection. The real heroes are the ones that rescued them but the focus is entirely on the heroine and her superhero son. Only saving grace is that the oldest boy did a great job with his acting ( they almost made this boy look like a super hero, over the top but that's not his fault) and Niomi Watts is a pleasure to watch, good actress. Over all a BAD movie that failed to capture the overall emotions and damage suffered by millions during this unprecedented natural disaster. Do yourself a favor and watch a documentary instead, if you are interested to learn or just see the tsunami and how it affected people. This movie is more geared to immature audience that get inspired and awed by heros.P.S I am not saying the main characters were not heroic in real life, I don't even know how much is true. My review is about the movie itself and the angle it took and not the real family involved. I am sure they deserved to be saved like everybody else deserved too.",3.0,Anonymous,History

Tsunami film shows that it pays to be a white if you're caught in a disaster,"ONE thing I learnt from watching Spanish director J.A. Bayona's tsunami disaster film is that it pays to have travel insurance and it's good to be a white if you're caught in a natural disaster.For the first lesson, I'd like to think that my insurance firm would rush over a luxurious private jet to pick up me and my family and transport me to a proper hospital in another country.I don't know of any insurance firm that would go to these lengths for its customers. It would have probably asked me to pay first and then make claims upon my return.For the second lesson, Bayona — whose movie is based on the true account of a Spanish family, the Belons — focuses on the impact of the Dec 26, 2004, tsunami on one white family.On watching it for the first time, I thought that it made sense to describe the trauma experienced by one family whose members were separated by the giant tidal wave. The sole white family could have represented the multitudes of families whose lives came crashing down to earth.On watching it for the second time, however, I noticed a huge void regarding the sufferings experienced by the local residents, that is, the Thais.The kid on the left doesn't look too frightened about what's going to happen in this CGI shot. Indonesia was the hardest hit, with about 130,000 deaths; Thailand recorded 5,395 deaths, and Malaysia, 68.In the film, nothing is seen or said about the Thai experience. The white woman and her son are brought to safety by an elderly man, and an elderly woman puts a blouse over the white woman.Some villagers take the injured white woman and he son to the hospital, and along the way, the plight of so many more whites is shown.At the hospital, there are only whites in it, with their pain and anguish being the film's foremost concern.The boy, too, helps to track only white patients.There are scenes of bodies left in the aftermath of the destruction, and they are white ones.When the husband of the white woman manages to call home, he talks only of his family. There's no mention about the death and destruction in Thailand.The finale of the film is also contrived. The director milks every second leading up the reconciliation between the family members in the hospital.The family in concern comprises big company employee Henry (Ewan McGregor), non-practising doctor wife Maria (Naomi Watts, nominated for an Oscar best actress for this role), and sons Lucas (Tom Holland), Thomas (Samuel Joslin) and Simon (Oaklee Pendergast).The film opens with the family in a plane about to land in a southern Thai island. Eldest son Lucas is rapped by his mum for not taking care of his brother.The family members settle in for their holiday. They are thrilled to light Thai balloons on Christmas Day on the resort's beach, but again, there's not a single Asian in sight.I had visited Phuket during the 2009 Christmas season, so I know that Thai resorts are overrun by whites. I had even joked that the number of whites was greater than the number of whites during this time of the year. But not even one non-white at the beach? Ewan McGregor with Samuel Joslin (left) and Oaklee Pendergast. Maria and Lucas are separated from the other three by the tsunami. I had seen Clint Eastwood's Hereafter and Korean tsunami disaster film Tidal Wave (2009), so I was prepared for the onslaught.But the director goes one better by showing what happens to Maria and Thomas in the water. They are hit by so many objects that it's a miracle that they did not die in the water.The film follows the badly-injured Maria and her son as they struggle to reach safety.However, I cannot take anything away from the excellent acting. Holland is wonderful in showing greater responsibility, especially when he orders his mum to get to the top of a tree and forget about the cries of a kid.Watts, for her part, must show pain, compassion and the desire to see her family again. She's terrific in the first half but she's then limited to a hospital bed and looking tired with a ghastly white pallor.McGregor gets to shine, even though his high-pitched boyish voice is distracting. His scene with the second son, when he convinces the kid to take care his brother while he (McGregor) goes to look for the others, is touching.Responsibility is a theme in the film, and all the kids step up their duties during this critical moment: Lucas takes care of his mum, while Thomas minds Simon.The ending of the film is like that in Argo. Viewers already know how the film will end, so there's no dramatic tension, but that doesn't stop Bayona from creating excitement out of nothing.www.jeffleemovies.com",5.0,Anonymous,History

Shameful...,"Although the film was well produced I just could not believe that it focused on the lives of a rich white family and although most of the maimed and dead were Thai there was virtually none shown as part of the movie which is a complete disgrace and how it could have been left out I really have not a clue - If I was Thai and had lost people I would have found this film to be very disrespectful and disingenous!Apart from the fact Ewan McGregor is one of the most over-rated actors and he is a fellow Scot I just cannot stand his poor acting skills and his attempts at various accents , in particular he cannot decided whether he is American or British in this film. Watts and the young boy give exemplary performances however so it does merit a fair few stars but would have been so much better if it had been a fairer representation of what the Thai people have experienced.One other thing that really gets my goat - if you check out all the real reviews on here you will notice they are around 1-6 stars then as soon as the real reviewers are posting along come the 9 and 10 star reviews in batches of between 5-10 - each profile having done only one review in their lifetime its so obvious the movie producers are paying people to ""big up"" the films ratings and its very sad that IMDB do not have a policy of monitoring and removing these shills.",5.0,Anonymous,History
"Utter rubbish, going nowhere","I gave this film a second try after not liking it much the first time round. That because I had been to Thailand and Sri Lanka, the places most affected by the tsunami. I have friends there and donated money to the community rebuilding efforts in one of the towns I had stayed in several times. But I was right, this is movie is a royal waste of time. The entire approach is wrong. The script sucks, the directing and acting is mediocre and the camera work... well, don't get me started. It's Shakycam all over, with the majority of scenes shot with relentless close ups, all for no reason other than screaming 'look how authentic!!' The actual tsunami scenes are shockingly realistic but that's about it. There is no real development from there, no context, nothing that would do justice to the global magnitude of the event. The story and photography suggest you should care about that one white family of five and even that doesn't work. All locals are nameless extras. Pointless and annoying to say the least.",2.0,Anonymous,History
Maybe Impossible but not Really Enjoyable,"Naomi Watts was phenomenal as Maria and skillfully played a severely wounded part for almost the entire movie (either struggling to move or from a hospital bed). I can honestly say that her performance is the best acting from an actress I saw in 2012.The make-up, depicting all manner of gruesome injuries and the set design, trying to re-create the rubbish from the tsunami, was superb and very effective.I also like that although the movie was based on a Caucasian family (who lived in Japan but was vacationing in Thailand for Christmas), the indigenous Thai people are portrayed as caring and sympathetic in this movie. The reason this really stood out to me, because I watched ARGO recently and was stunned at how one-dimensional, stereotypical, and negatively the Iranian people were portrayed. Here, in THE IMPOSSIBLE, the Thai are rendered much more humane and are critical for the protagonist family in their attempt to reunite.However, the reason for the low star-rating is mostly due to how the movie drags on after the first 20-30 minutes. Perhaps that was intended to get more and more shots of carnage and to impart a sense of hopelessness (this movie did make me feel hopeless once or twice, but not in the way the director probably wanted!). Really, the whole quest seemed ""impossible"" though it was based on a true story. Again, not really the ""impossible"" that the director was probably going for, but rather impossible to care about and implausible.Another major issue I had was that we leave Ewan McGregor's Henry until nearly an hour of the film has elapsed. The problem is that I felt Ewan seemed to try to overact his scenes to get the most out of it, probably because he was left out of so many scenes. I normally enjoy McGregor's performances but I thought he came off as amateurish and lame in this role.I won't be critical of the children in the film, because that would be just mean. But, they did alright, and Tom Holland, the boy who played Lucas, had a large role and seems to have quite a future in the acting business.TL;DR: Overall this was a movie that dragged on and failed to inject the viewer with the emotion that it needed to. It's sad because a film of this nature should make it easy to portray those tearjerking sentiments. Obviously, I understood the devastation and tragedy, having made a donation at the time this happened, but this movie failed to make me emote as some other tragic movies have. THE IMPOSSIBLE is watchable simply for Naomi Watts' performance and the opening 30 minutes. The rest is not worth watching.",4.0,Anonymous,History
