A solid drama on a human scale,"After catching snippets of the lackluster reviews (two-stars in the Globe and Mail) I was dis-heartened. It's been a few months since I'd been moved by the trailer. However, the film never came out. I thought it might have been shelved.I was glad to see it was indeed playing. In spite of the reviews, I persevered on the strength of the trailer. It seemed to me there was too much talent and pedigree involved for it to actually suck. And you know what? it's a terrific film with a poignant story. Perhaps lower expectations propped up my perceptions of it, however, it still stands as time well spent.The film is based on a true story involving a top columnist at the LA Times, Steve Lopez, played with grace by Robert Downey Jr., who becomes invested in one of his more colourful subjects, Nathaniel Ayers, an accomplished musician overcome by mental illness, now living on the streets of LA portrayed by Jamie Foxx, who rambles his way to a convincing performance.The film is a satisfying adult drama that doesn't lose it's direction. It doesn't pander to it's audience. There is no random violence, no guns, but indeed simply good story telling with great characterizations. It's a decent film that deserves better treatment in the press. It has a noble heart that succeeds in telling a great human story.It resonates and strikes a chord.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Going solo,"With an interesting subject matter, two talented actors starring, Beethoven (one of my favourite composers) featuring heavily in the soundtrack and an impressive trailer, 'The Soloist' had enough to make me want to see it.Joe Wright is somewhat hit and miss for me. 'Atonement' and 'Hanna' especially of his films are great, also liked 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Darkest Hour'. 'Anna Karenina' didn't do it for me though and 'Pan' was a big misfire. 'The Soloist's' mixed reception admittedly created some uncertainty on my part, but the interest points mentioned in the first paragraph were enough to check it out anyway. Seeing it, 'The Soloist' is somewhere in the middle of Wright's films in ranking.Not one of his best, not one of his worst either. Better than reputed, but considering the potential a better film was in there somewhere that didn't quite materialise.'The Soloist's' biggest strength is the two leads. Robert Downey Jnr. especially is riveting in a performance full of vigour and heart. Jamie Foxx had the more challenging role, and while not as subtle as Downey his acting is incredibly emotionally committed and touching. Catherine Keener also fares well.It's a good looking film too, polished, gritty and elegant. The music is magnificent as one would hope. 'The Soloist' does have its fair share of powerful, poignant and uplifting moments, the chemistry between the two leads strikes all the right notes and the scenes and portrayal of the homeless have a lot of power. The portrayal of schizophrenia, a very complex condition that has been prone to a lot of misconceptions and misinterpretations, is not too inaccurate.However, Wright's direction is fairly unimaginative and sometimes chaotic. While there is nothing amateurish about his images (apart from some over-eager/clever editing) not all of them serve much of a purpose. The script does tend to ramble, even in Foxx's dialogue which is at times slightly annoying, and be too ham-fisted.Similarly, the story is somewhat too thin and tries to cover too many themes and ideas without exploring some of them enough. Consequently, some of the film gets unfocused and over-crowded with a tendency to get melodramatic and be erratically paced. The rest of the acting barely registers, which is a shame because the two leads are so good.Overall, not a bad film but could have been more. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A True Story About Urban Homelessness,"What makes this film watchable is that it is based on a true story. A caring Los Angeles reporter named Steve Lopez (Robert Downey, Jr.) tries to help a homeless man named Nathaniel Anthony Ayers (Jamie Foxx).Ayers suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. But he once attended Julliard, and he still lives and breathes the music of Beethoven. Ayers, with his shopping cart of possessions, walks the streets, playing his violin amid the noise of the freeway. He's content, in his own world.That unusual behavior grabs the attention of Lopez, no doubt as a human interest story for his own column. But as Lopez gradually becomes more genuinely concerned about Ayers, their relationship encounters frustration, anger, and emotional pain.It's a poignant, gritty story, full of realism. The film manages to be compassionate without being patronizing. The film does a terrific job in portraying the harsh, depressing reality of the boarders who live at a large shelter where Ayers goes, at the insistence of Lopez.Technical elements of the film are good. The visuals are thematically impressive. Production design and costumes are detailed and realistic. Acting is credible. Robert Downey, Jr. gives a fine performance.The main problem is the plot. Too much time is spent on Lopez and his trivialities. Somehow, the compelling Ayers story morphs into a weighty examination of Lopez and his distress in dealing with Ayers. The script is to blame here. I think if the main character had been Ayers, instead of Lopez, the film could have been quite inspiring.Even so, the film clearly calls attention to the plight of the urban homeless. As such, the film deserves viewer support.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Interesting to know,"I am a musician and live in France, where the release date of this movie is scheduled for Sept. 2 2009. I obviously cannot write a review at the present time but have nevertheless read the book.What no one mentions in all of the above comments is that Nathaniel Ayers was originally a Double Bass student at Julliard and NOT a cellist. That instrument-- along with the violin, trumpet, and piano, all came about later on. Put any instrument into his hands and he'll do his best to master it.Having attended Yale university, I did not know him personally, even though we studied with one of the greatest bass teachers in the New York area at that time: Homer Mensch. Recently our paths did finally cross thanks to one of our mutual acquaintances, bassist and composer Joe Russo. Nathan likes to write down the names of his long lost good friends on walls, or any writing surface, and Joe's name is always there, scribbled amongst his favorites. This was where Steve noticed Joe's name and Googled him to look up his website. A new and close friendship resulted between them, and the many anecdotes that Joe pulled out of Nathan's past were worth their weight in gold to Steve, enough to devote the entire chapter 8 of the book to Joe!To me, reading this book made me come to the conclusion that every man has his hour in life, and Nathan's time had come now. The chances of 2 men, one homeless and one not, being pulled together through the sound of a violin in a rush hour tunnel, were undoubtedly written in the stars. Through articles, a book and now a film on Nathan, Steve helped uplift a poor and abandoned part of society to a rank that it never imagined nor asked for, but morally deserved. We all know that the Internet is indeed capable of connecting and reconnecting people in the present, but only music can magically, throughout time, open the doors that connect all of us to one another.",,Anonymous,Music
The Other Side of the American Dream,"In Los Angeles, the reporter of the LA Times Steve Lopez (Robert Downey Jr.) writes the successful column Points West. After an accident with his bicycle, Steve wanders on the streets and hears a classic music being played by a homeless violinist with an out of commission violin. Steve starts a conversation with the musician fan of Beethoven Nathaniel Anthony Ayers Jr. (Jamie Foxx) and when the man tells him that he had studied cello in Juilliard, Steve researches his life and writes a series of articles in his column about the talented but mentally ill musician. He befriends the schizophrenic Nathaniel and brings him to the Lamp Community in Los Angeles. The work of Steve Lopez is awarded and he attempts to help the musician, but in his insanity, Nathaniel does not want to change his lifestyle.""The Soloist"" is apparently based on a true story of a relationship of a journalist and a schizophrenic musician and discloses the other side of the American Dream in Los Angeles with 90,000 homeless people. In this regard, this film uses a different approach of Wim Wenders' ""Land of Plenty"" to slightly show the reality of homeless people in Los Angeles. The problem is that apparently the columnist wrote articles and was awarded, and wrote a book that became a movie, probably making lots of money, while Nathaniel Ayers Jr. is still on the streets and sleeping in a shelter. Please excuse me if I am unfair, but the film does not show a great effort from Steve Lopez to hire a psychologist to help Nathaniel to improve his life. Further, the screenplay is cold despite the choice of two excellent actors in the lead roles. The music score with Beethoven and Bach is a plus in this deceptive film. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""O Solista"" (""The Soloist"")",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Deception,"The trailer might give you the impression that you are going to watch just another drama. But luckily it ain't so. This movie is gritty and does not deliver any easy answers. It has some pretty gross scenes (though they seem in tune with the situation the city is going through and depict therefor a very real situation), but all that is shown is in tune with the rest of the movie.Robert Downey again delivers. And to think that he almost completely went off the (acting/movie) radar ... Luckily he didn't and luckily for us, Jon Favreau got him back to the big game with Iron Man. A movie which allows him, to go do movies like the Solist and earn them some PR. With Jamie Foxx he creates a relationship that feels more than real (considering their characters and their ""flaws""). Watch this, but don't expect anything ""Hollywood"" about it",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Thoughts To Prepare You for Watching the Film.,"Since Ingmar Bergman's 1962 film, ""Through a Glass, Darkly"", the 2009 film ""The Soloist"" is one of the two most accurate portrayals of schizophrenia, from the point of view of the mentally ill person and of people who want to interact with the ill person. I speak from experience. David Cronenberg's film, ""Spider"", is the other.I was disappointed in my two favourite critics, James Berardinelli and Roger Ebert, each of who gave ""The Soloist"" only 62½%.Berardinelli says, ""The Soloist is afflicted with a lack of passion. The story lacks a strong trajectory; it meanders, seemingly unsure of precisely what it wants to do and say and where it wants to go."" Actually, that is the reality of schizophrenia. One never knows what is going to happen next. There are many setbacks. He also says, ""The soundtrack supplies multiple, overlapping voices. The objective is to invite the viewer to participate in the unhinging of Nathaniel's mind, a first-person perspective of schizophrenia. Unfortunately, it feels artificial and contrived."" I have taught seven NAMI* courses on mental illness. One episode in one of the classes involves requiring class members to perform certain simple tasks while being bombarded by random voices from behind. Many class members find that to be the most unnerving, and illuminating, of all the activities in the course.Ebert misses the point when he says, ""Yes, mental illness can be like that, but can successful drama? There comes a point when Lopez has had enough, and so, in sympathy, have we."" Dealing with a mentally ill person can be devastatingly frustrating. Must we always be entertained? There is a place for grim reality in drama. Otherwise, how can we learn?""The Soloist"" is as accurate a representation of schizophrenia as you could experience without becoming mentally ill yourself. If you keep that in mind then the film will be rewarding; if, however, you are looking for a film that makes sense easily and progresses from point to point in a logical manner, then look for a different film.If you choose to watch the film and absorb the reality of mental illness, then you will learn much. You never know when that knowledge will be of great value to you. Then again, you may be spared, and never need it.The film introduces a very important idea: mentally ill people do better if there is someone, whom they trust, who takes an abiding interest in them.It also poses one very important question: should mentally ill persons be forced to take medication to stabilize themselves? Different states, provinces and countries have different laws concerning this. Some feel that mentally ill persons should be forced to take medication if and only if they are likely to harm themselves or others. Mentally ill persons are often unaware that they are mentally ill, and cannot be convinced otherwise. Would they have more freedom to decide correctly for themselves if they were first medicated until they become sane? The film addresses this question but does not attempt to give a definitive answer. You will have to think out that question yourself, keeping in mind that different people have different reactions to the same medication. There is no universal answer, but for each individual, there is probably a best answer but not necessarily a good one.The film captivated me from the beginning to the end. I did not miss the common devices that some movies use to make them exciting. There was excitement enough for me in the growth of the principal characters and in the learning that I did, and in the thinking that I was forced to do.*NAMI is The National Alliance on Mental Illness.P.S. Schizophrenia has absolutely nothing to do with having multiple personalities, or of dichotomies (apparent contradictions). The split in the expression ""split personality"" is the split between the personality and reality. Unfortunately, the word is misused far more often that it is used correctly.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Good but not great,"Steve Lopez is a journalist for the LA Times. He is on the lookout for new story ideas when he stumbles across Nathaniel Ayers, a homeless man with extraordinary musical talents. Lopez is eager to improve Ayers's situation, while writing a story on him, but the biggest problem may be Ayers himself.Good but not great. Emotional journey, but somehow something is lacking. I just didn't feel as engaged as I normally would for a story like this.

An Unremarkable Story,"I can't give this a low, low score because it is a technically proficient movie - good camera, good lighting, and realistic environments and dialog.Unfortunately, the script was utterly boring.It's clear the writer and director were trying to make a connection with the audience, and cause them to well up with tears for our poor, afflicted main character (Jaime Foxx). But, when the cresendo came and the climax passed, I was just playing mental gymnastics wondering ""When will I start caring?""

Solid Film But Not Groundbreaking,"For the most part this was an enjoyable film. However, I felt there were missing segments. I know this was based on a true story. I understand that Steve Lopez and Nathaniel Ayers , became unlikely friends and formed an unlikely bond , that inspired one another. I get all this , but again , the film was just a miss. The film featured fantastic acting performances , but the lackluster gaps in this film, through no fault of the actors , I might add, kept this film from being spectacular. Nathaniel Ayers a musician, a brilliant one at that, never realized his dream due to mental illness. Being a homeless person, Steve Lopez, journalist from the L.A. Times smelled a story. Rather than being just another cold story to fill a column quota, Mr. Lopez, gradually became attached to Ayers, thus a human bond developed with true, friendship bonds and no ulterior motives for Lopez. Do not get me wrong this was a nice story and particularly the later part of the movie brought this film from being just an average film to a pretty good film. There were some heartwarming moments and tears but I never really felt a kinship toward the characters, as I usually do in some 'select' moving films. This is definitely worth a watch , for the acting performances alone. Jamie Foxx was equally as good in this film as he was in 'Ray' and of course, we know that Downey Jr. shines in , whatever he does.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Such high hopes have diminished into sheer disappointment.,"Made watchable through it's rich performances (especially Robert Downey Jr.) and it's beautiful music, but the film feels like it's trying to hard to cover too much ground while at the same time beating you over the head with humanitarian elements that really have no place or room.A friendship is formed between a divorced writer and a homeless, schizophrenic musician when they have a chance meeting. What could have been a great story about friendship went heavy handed and up it's own ass in little messages that by the end of the film I, in a way, felt cheated. I felt like they were teasing me with a good story and actors but instead decided to give me pointless intersections throughout (don't even get me started on Nathaniel Ayers' ""flashbacks"" and ""thoughts"").The film would have been better if they had concentrated on the point of view of Robert Downey, Jr.'s character and not try to dive into Ayers' psyche. That made it seem hokey and with the addition of what Downey's character said near the end made it that much more insulting. There was just so much stuff the filmmakers tried to cover and didn't elaborate very much on.The performances, though, were brilliant. Foxx gets a little over-the-top with his ability to scene-chew, but Downey gives a down to earth, realistic performance. Even though they were all really good, I just kept feeling like Foxx was just trying to out-act Downey. With that said, he was still wonderful.I don't know. Maybe I'm reading too much into it and maybe I'm just ragging on it because I didn't like it, but, oh well. I am a critic, right?",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Lacked development....,"Steve Lopez is a Los Angeles Times columnist in need of a decent story.One day he encounters,by chance, Nathaniel Ayers, a homeless schizophrenic street musician with an abundance of talent.Lopez writes a series of articles about Nathaniel and tries to help him, to improve his conditions of living and gives him a chance to showcase his talent however Nathaniel's disease has created demons that he can't ignore and Lopez sees most of his efforts frustrated...To be honest I was expecting a way better movie, I saw the trailer months ago and it got me excited, the movie seemed to have all the ingredients to be a success,plus two amazing actors, Robert Downey Jr as Lopez and Jammie Foxx as Nathaniel.However, I felt disappointed.Lopez struggle to reach to Nathaniel and his constant efforts to help him were interesting to watch but that is pretty much everything that happens in the movie.In the end almost everything looks the same as in the beginning and not much has happened.Sure, Lopez had a small yet positive impact on Nathaniel's life and he,himself, might have gained a little something from that relationship too but I was expecting a wider range of events so to speak...I'm not saying that he should have been cured by the end of the film, as much as Hollywood loves happy endings that would be unrealistic but I did expect something to happen...some kind of development that would make this story worth telling.It never came. Maybe this story(based on real events) just doesn't translate very well to the big screen.I think the film aspired to be great but felt short.On a more positive note, Jamie Foxx's performance was great and felt very authentic.6/10",,Anonymous,Music
Good.....but you could sense that it could have been better,"Both Jamie Foxx and Robert Downey Jr. have done nothing but star in big budget box office blockbusters lately. Obviously, the both of them felt that it was time for for something smaller, so that everyone could really see their acting talents, rather than the special effects or comedy that normally swirl around them. Hopefully with this true tale of a homeless man with a gifted talent could bring that about for both of them. The first thing that i must talk about is the acting.......because both Robert Downey and Jamie Foxx brought their ""A"" game to the table. Especially Jamie Foxx, because since his Oscar winning performance in ""Ray"", i really haven't seen too much from him.......but this movie certainly showed that he still has it. He should easily be nominated for best supporting actor. Now onto the rest of the film. Well.....it was a really good story, and in a way it was just as well........however, there were sequences that just dragged on, and scenes that were just plain boring. I think the reason was that they didn't really delve into the character development of Robert Downey Jr's role. I didn't really feel why he wanted to help this man so much, and they didn't fully explain the struggles that he himself was going through. To best sum it up, the movie is much like ""A Beautiful Mind"", but not told as passionately. I mean you could sense the struggle that Jamie Foxx's character was going through......but it just didn't ""GET"" you like you wanted it to. Bottom Line, the movie was good......but at times it just seemed to drag on waaayyyy too much. I think they should have left some scenes out, or maybe replace them with something that was a little more in-depth with its storytelling. It was good, but you couldn't help but notice that it did have potential to be something better.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Solid Performances In a Weak Film,"As I walked in and sat in a seat at my nearby movie theater waiting to watch The Soloist, I was hoping to get what the trailers seemed promise: a strong, character-driven story led by two talented actors ultimately amounting to a solid film. What I got was half of this. The Soloist does well with some of the material it has, but there are too many missteps throughout the film (especially in the first act) to make it anything above decent.The film's plot is fairly basic. Robert Downey Jr. plays a writer for the Los Angeles Times (Steve Lopez) who comes across a homeless violin/ex-cello player (Nathaniel Ayers) with Jamie Foxx filling in the character's shoes. Lopez sees potential for Ayers to make a ""comeback"" so to speak and begins writing a column for him in the newspaper. Of course not everything works out so well and several debacles take place throughout the course of the film. All of this unfolds with some fairly haphazard approaches and mixed results.What really hurts the film is many of the choices made to progress the plot and emphasize the characters. The scenes which show the viewer what happened to Nathaniel before he became homeless come of as either perfectly adequate or inconsistent. Many of the film's scenes involve multiple voices saying/repeating lines/words over and over which, quite frankly, do get annoying before long. It also feels rather odd having a good few dialogue exchanges occur with both or all of the characters talking at once. Whether this was intentional or not doesn't detract from it feeling unnecessary and taking the viewer out of the unfolding plot.What does work in the film is the performances by the two lead actors. Downey Jr. does a great job playing a conflicted newspaper writer and he also takes part in a couple...nasty scenes that make for good, brief comedic moments. As for Foxx, he manages to do an equally, if not superior job fitting into his role and, unlike the film itself, barely has any hiccups during his performance. While both put on great performances, don't expect them to be in the running for the Oscars since they come just a slight nudge below excellence in their screen time. Part of this (mostly in Foxx's case) can be attributed to the questionable style of development as mentioned above. For the first half of the film it's tough to really care much about what happens but the second half does help even things out with stronger scenes. In regards to the supporting cast, most of them are negligible and, other than those who have more frequently occurrences (which granted aren't that many), barely stand out.The Soloist is a film that had plenty of potential to be a precursor to the film releases over the summer. Unfortunately, the film lacks a proper sense of pacing and direction to make it realize this potential. Foxx and Downey Jr. put on two great performances and during some of their key scenes, it's far easier to get immersed in the film. However, the film itself doesn't fare nearly as well and misses the mark just too much to be worthy of a full recommendation.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Reporter finds music on the streets-movie version loses the point,"Arrestingly-filmed yet oddly distanced dramatization of LA Times columnist Steve Lopez's (Robert Downey, Jr) series of articles regarding his befriending and increased sponsoring of a failed classical musician, Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx), now begging for change near several of the city's musical landmarks and during his investigations becoming forced to explore his own societal and interpersonal biases & fears. Lopez appeared to accept from reader reaction that Ayers--swerving between trilled spouting of information and history and self-dangerous descents into violent rage--came through the reportage more believably and immediate when the two went into action together--touring old haunts, enduring rehab, abandoned family members like Ayers' sister Jennifer (Lisagay Hamilton) reintroduced to him yet the encounters brim with recrimination. Yet through the patient and increasing level of support not just from the uncertain Lopez (almost driven to drink or career distraction without the knowing, cheeky support of his ex-wife and editor (Catherine Keener) but from an unexpectedly diverse range of contributors in LA and around the US who register their remembrance of Ayers or admiration of Lopez' remarkable patience and dedicated journalism, the film winds everything through a completely overburdened halfway house in the second half where Ayers himself will make the film's climactic decision on whether to embrace the help of esteemed classical musicians and a stable household or destroy himself in the immense miasma of the LA slums. THE SOLOIST refuses to either take sides or provide easy answers, and to a degree director Joe Wright (ATONEMENT) looks like he could pull the film version's ethically unovert conditions off successfully. Downey and Foxx throughout the film compete with Wright's excessively willful, almost smothering stylization--very hard key lighting and light source spillage, minimalist background staging, profile close-ups and crowded two shots whipped away by breathtaking location zoom lensing, all topped off with a breathtaking hi-fidelity sound mix (the orchestra scenes sound like the mikes were placed right into the bowstrings), alternating with reassuringly traditional lighting and designing of scenes of Ayers' childhood and early education at Julliard. Downey is particularly impressive, seeming to get steadily greyer and more anxious as he guides and controls Ayers' naive remembrances and stocky musical technique into repicking up his beloved cello permanently. As Ayers, Foxx packs a generally believable punch playing a street urchin who was capable of much more, and as the relationship developed I noticed Susannah Grant's screenplay devoting an inordinate--some might say unbalanced--amount of time to both Ayers and the wonky lot of the city's environs, creating understandably large amounts of audience empathy yet tottering a little too trustworthily into the comfort zone of a $60 million dollar big-star vehicle lecturing America about the poor. The result is that Foxx's zombied character conception (the fault may be more Grant's than his, though) lacks either the leavening humor, sociopolitical complexity, and symbolic gravitas (the film version cannot decide if its supposed to be a docudrama or a riveting psychological examination) to humanize him against Lopez and make them a representational force of both their adoptive city or their career frustrations. THE SOLOIST in the end does make for a occasionally striking and formatively well-acted drama but its arch technique and lack of severe social reverberation fails to take detailed advantage of two very fine actors and only partly captures the playful yet deeply haunting contact of an American journalist to a specimen/victim of America's obstinate focus on success and what an 'artist' should be.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Uplifting: Finding a Golden Needle in the Haystack of Urban Blight,"First off, I should say that I am personally familiar with this story, having worked in downtown L.A. for the last 19 years and seeing Mr Ayers and his cello many a time around 3rd and Hill Sts. I've also read Lopez's columns in the Times for years and followed this one with interest and satisfaction. Making a film about a tale like this restores my belief in Hollywood beyond the mindless bunk it churns out year after year.Downey Jr and Foxx play a newspaper columnist and homeless man who come together in a most unusual way. Downey is a newspaper columnist looking for something original and interesting to write about. He finds it when he sees Foxx beautifully playing battered stringed instruments along 3rd street in downtown L.A. Foxx has been there for years but on this day grabs the eye of the columnist because the columnist himself is experiencing hardship and doubt related to his own position. He begins to write about this talented but troubled man who fills the stinky air around him with harmony. They become friends but keep in mind this is not fiction. The friendship hits many bumps that continue to this day. Nathaniel Ayers (Foxx's character) may be a brilliant, educated musician, but he suffers from bouts of schizophrenia that manifest at any time. Downey's character accepts this as it adds more intrigue to his columns. Then he accepts it on a personal level. Their friendship ultimately becomes real and meaningful. You sense that Downey's character needs the friendship even more than Foxx's homeless man does. In the end, Downey's Lopez can see the positive effect his work has brought to the plight of the homeless, yet he wonders personally how much better he has made Nathaniel...? His reflections make us think also.Downey Jr and Foxx play their characters to near perfection and the film masterfully takes its time in developing the relationship between the two. Great to see director Joe Wright telling a contemporary tale just as effectively as he has in previous works. The film makes us wonder how many other Nathaniel Ayers are lurking out there on the streets? Life being what it is, of course we will never know. The beauty of the film is that is shows what can happen when just one Nathaniel Ayers is found after being lost for so many years. There's no sugarcoating; Ayers doesn't magically get better and rejoin mainstream society. Instead, the mainstream accepts him for what he is and what he offers and begins integrating him as best it can. This film will certainly pop up at award time next year.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Hard look at homelessness,"My first thoughts when this movie started were of the movie ""Resurrecting the Champ"" with Josh Hartnett and Samuel L. Jackson. That was an excellent movie about a Denver reporter who thought he stumbled upon a former heavyweight champ who was now homeless. That was also based upon a true story.In ""The Soloist"" Steven Lopez (Robert Downey Jr.) is a reporter for the L. A. Times who stumbles upon a former Julliard School cellist. Lopez decides to write a human interest piece about this now homeless man named Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx). The article, which ran serially, garnered Lopez and Ayers a lot of attention. Lopez, in a very demanding way, wanted to turn Ayers' life around for the better as though it was something he had to do and something Ayers had to accept. But Ayers wasn't homeless because he simply had bad breaks or a drug addiction.Ayers had serious psychological problems, and dealing with a person with mental and psychological problems is not easy as Lopez found out the hard way.""The Soloist"" takes a harder look at homelessness than any movie I've ever seen. This is a problem that hits very close to home for me as I live near San Francisco which is probably now the homeless capital of the country. Ayers was just one type of homeless case--a very gifted individual with a psychological handicap keeping him from a normal life.This movie is very depressing though it is realistic. You want Ayers to find that something to make him whole, make him right, and make him no longer homeless, but how can someone find what they're not looking for, especially when he doesn't trust those trying to guide him to it? It's a conundrum. ""The Soloist"" doesn't promise a happy ending, but it promises a real ending.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Music Menanced By Madness,"Within a one-week period, I saw my second screening of this powerful movie today. I am mystified by some of the ""bilious-type"" reviews found here, seemingly driven by an anti-Joe Wright campaign. I found no cheap sentiments in the story line and I was awed by the high-octane performances of Jamie Foxx and Robert Downey, Jr. Nothing being perfect in an imperfect world, as ""adult"" entertainment, ""The Soloist"" did not once insult my intelligence. I marveled at the complexity of the screenplay and the realization of it by its gifted director and the camera-work of Seamus McGarvey. The gifted Dario Marianelli is credited as the film's composer, anecdotally, in the gigantic shadow of Ludwig van Beethoven. Mental illness, genius, homelessness, journalism and music has rarely been so well presented as an ""entertainment."" Yes, Mr. Ayers is depicted as experiencing a ""light show"" when attending a rehearsal of the L. A. Philharmonic. At least we didn't see pink hippopotamus in tutus or dinosaurs on a rampage in a prehistoric setting. Being so accustomed to televised concerts, I expected the camera to focus on the instruments themselves in this sequence. And, ""clapping pigeons."" Great idea that works. A brave film directed at a ""non-art house"" audience. I also want to cite the wonderful work of Nelsan Ellis who plays David at LAMP. So much compassion comes off the screen with his presence. There is no way we can make ""light"" of the tragedy of the homeless, so many with mental illness. Thank you Mr. Steve Lopez for introducing me to Mr. Nathaniel Anthony Ayers. My life is richer for the experience. LisaGay Hamilton, as Jennifer Ayers, Nathaniel's sister, deserves recognition in a small, but pivotal role that brings dignity and catharsis to a heart-wrenching experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Phenomenal acting, poor editing","Jamie Foxx and Robert Downey Jr. Both deliver exceptional performances, and the ending is nice, but the movie itself is painfully slow. I wish they advanced the plot faster, cut or at least shortened certain sequences, like the hearing-music-as-colors scene, which I felt was kind of random and didn't add anything to Ayers' character. On the other hand, I feel they maybe could have added more flashbacks to help fill in more of the gaps in Ayers' past and how he got to where he was at the start of the movie, such as past attempts to get him diagnosed, etc. If you can make it through the first half, the acting only gets better. Overall, still recommend watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Two Good Strings,"Yes, you can trust Joe Wright with your life, without bound for two hours.Some parts of this are simply ordinary. There's the original sequence of stories which exploited the simple tension of discarded talent in a city that both worships talent and discards people wholesale. These were simple structures, headlines and patronizing prose.There's the screenplay by a hack, with simple shape and essentially no movement. In other words, forget what people usually think a movie is about: the people and the story. Those parts are missing. There is no happy ending. There is no redemption.But this has three things: madness, music and the marriage of madness and music.I saw this right after ""State of Play,"" a traditional newspaper movie, with archetypal writer and editor. This is a modern version with two of our most folded actors: Downey and Keener. Their job is simple: define an edge between internal and external. The coupled acting here is not between Downey and Foxx, but between Downey and Keener playing a recently divorced couple. There's a quiet tension these two build around the absent son, whose place Foxx's character fills.Foxx makes not a character but an phenomenon, an experience, this experience of madness in music. He is helped by being placed amid folks who we are told are ""real disturbed people."" What Wright has is a fairly vacuous notion of madness, but a sublime talent in expressing it cinematically. Some of his tricks are trivial when considered independently: a cutout of Ayers getting smaller and ""disappearing into"" the music; a cheesy light show to Beethoven; an attempt to conflate voices in the head to music in the head. This latter is very real but the expression is cheap.While they seem trite individually, none are used heavily or relied on. And the effect when combined with more masterly things produces a symphony of excess. Downey's character remarks on the sheer depth, the love the penetration in describing just this very thing we see. It works. Music, indeed all real paths through passion are madness. Every adventure into commitment is a step outside safety of self.Wright knows this. He feels it. He can show it. I can trust him with my life. Its madness to do so, but I recommend it to you.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,Music
interesting story. based on real events.,"Based on a real guy found by a real newspaper columnist ! Steve is played by Robert Downey. Who, completely by chance, meets a musician in a downtown LA park. Nathaniel Ayers, played by Jamie Foxx, had started at Julliard, but dropped out. And is now hanging out in the parks of LA. Playing a broken violin. So we flash back to his youth, to watch his story unfold. We spend time watching Steve in a shelter. We flash back and forth, between his youth and his current, homeless life. He clearly has mental issues. Which are really interfering with a normal life. Which is why he's out on the streets. It's a good story. Directed by Joe Wright, who was nominated for two Baftas. Based on the book by....the actual reporter...Steve Lopez. The proceeds of which, according to the credits, go towards the fund to support Nathaniel and other musicians with mental illnesses. And we get to hear a whole lot of Beethoven.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Story needs to find flow,It's 2005. Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez (Robert Downey Jr.) is looking for his next subject to write about. He discovers mentally ill Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx) playing his broken violin. He befriends the homeless musician and begins to write about him as well as the homeless of LA. Nathaniel showed some skills as a child and concentrated on music and nothing else. He got as far as Juilliard but dropped out in his second year.There are two good performances from two great actors. It's too bad there isn't something more compelling or that the story isn't told better. I wonder if Nathaniel's life story told straight up wouldn't be better. This is based on the real newspaper columns. Maybe there is too much Steve Lopez. The movie is more about him than Nathaniel. There is way too much about coyote urine which is marginally amusing at best. The story just needs to find that compelling flow.The best part of the movie are the LA skid row scenes. The mass of mentally disturbed is quite shocking and seems like an unreal creation. That's something different at least.,6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Mr. Foxx and Mr. Downey, Jr.","Lots of times i see a film after i see the rating on Rotten Tomatoes or maybe reading a review without spoilers. I did it with this film and saw it already thinking it's bad, and that's the last time i do that, i really enjoyed this film, not a 10 but maybe re-watchable.Jamie Foxx and Robert Downey, Jr. give solid acting, even when particularly i don't like Mr. Foxx to much, except for Ray of course, i think he should keep playing real life musicians, and Mr. Downey, Jr. had just started with the MCU, so ironically he's playing a guy who helps another guy (Mr. Foxx) to get back on his feet when himself is starting to do so in real life in 2008-09, and does it really great (in the movie and in real life). Also with a good script and good secondary acting by Mrs. Keener. I give it a 7, it's not that high but it's really good compared to the other critics.

The Truth about Schizophrenia,"I sometimes work clinically with schizophrenics. This film shows us the truth about working with severely mentally ill people. David, the man who runs the shelter for the homeless honestly spoke the truth with his stance that is opposite of what the Pharmaceutical Industry, most of psychiatry and the legal system try to make us believe. David was my hero in this movie.All though the movie goes quickly over Jamie Fox's childhood trauma and losses -- it's still there, i.e. no father and the truck on fire represent some of the traumas that created his illness. Homeless people with mental illness did not come from healthy childhoods. Almost all came from repeated childhood trauma.(see New Zealand Psychologist John Read PhD and colleagues, the ACE Study from the CDC, and Charles Whitfield's book The Truth about Mental Illness, 2004).Hollywood did not cover over the painful truths in this story. Jamie Fox's character's mother and his sister were good people and that comes through but they couldn't prevent his wounding. At the end of the film, we are told ""90,000 Homeless people in Los Angeles."" We walked out of the theater overwhelmed with that figure and uplifted by this true story.If you're really interested in the truth about schizophrenia there is an excellent DVD documentary called Take These Broken Wings: Recover from Schizophrenia without Medication by Daniel Mackler",10.0,Anonymous,Music
The Pigeons are Clapping,"Greetings again from the darkness. Odd fact-based story of one-time musical prodigy-now homeless man Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx) and his chance encounter turned friendship with LA Times writer Steve Lopez (Robert Downey, Jr.). The story is pretty tough to watch at times but director Joe Wright (Atonement) does a good job of adding enough Hollywood to prevent it from spinning too far off into mental illness and politics.RDJ and Mr. Foxx are both excellent in their presentation of challenging characters. The music is, of course, excellent (Mr. Ayers has a fascination with Beethoven) and we get a glimpse inside the LA symphony hall (designed by Frank Gehry).There were a few continuity issues and some of the scenes were a bit too fluffy for me, but this is such an amazing story that you can't help but find it interesting. First movie I can recall where a lead character has a run in with a urine container ... not once, but twice. And Neil Diamond has a couple of songs and photo, which just adds to the weirdness",7.0,Anonymous,Music
a poisonous message,"I really wondered what the point of this movie was, and about two-thirds of the way through the light dawned. This is a ""message"" movie, and the message is a poisonous one.Sometime in the 60's we as a nation became revolted at conditions in our mental institutions, which were indeed horrific and grotesque. This is where society had warehoused everyone whose mental conditions were so extreme that even their own families could not cope with them. Government being what it is, it was never to be expected that these poor souls would get compassionate treatment.So it was decided to grant these individuals their ""rights"" and release them all to the street. There was supposed to be a wave of neighborhood mental health clinics to look after them; that never transpired. As a result these poor souls now live in the street and often pose a safety risk to others. Jails and prisons are now the front line in dealing with the mentally ill.Unfortunately a whole movement has arisen advocating for the ""rights"" of these people to live as they are, i.e. as mentally unbalanced people. The sad thing is that, with proper medication, many of these folks could be restored to some semblance of normality.In clearly siding with the ""right"" of Nathaniel not to be medicated, this movie, in my view, sends a very toxic message whose upshot is that these people should be allowed to live their lives of misery and to continue to pose a threat to - dare I utter the word? - ""normal"" people. The issue of how we deal with our mentally ill is a complex and thorny one, but I don't think it's useful to maintain that it's just dandy not to treat them.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
"""The Soloist"" Will Carry You Home","Robert Downey Jr. is amazing in Joe Wright's ""The Soloist"". Downey is powerful, and embodies such humanity and compassion. His performance is never self-conscious, all about the character and the story. There is a quiet scene where Downey's Steve Lopez confesses to his ex-wife Mary (wonderful Catherine Keener) about Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx), ""He's got a gift"" But Steve is at the breaking point in his efforts in helping the disturbed former child protégée. Keener consoles, ""You are not going to cure him All you can do is be his friend."" ""The Soloist"" is brilliant in its catharsis and simplicity. Director Joe Wright (""Atonement"") literally orchestrates powerful and touching performances from Downey and Foxx. Screenwriter Susannah Grant does a virtuoso translation of Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez's book. I loved ""The Soloist"". ""The Soloist"" is so compelling in its humanity.Based on a true story, ""The Soloist"" tells the story of Steve's (Downey) friendship with Nathaniel (Foxx). By accident L.A. Times writer Steve Lopez meets Nathaniel Ayers on his lunch break in the park. The homeless Nathaniel is playing Beethoven on his two string violin. Nathaniel admits to Steve, ""I've had a few set backs."" Steve sees a potential story in this—for him. After initial research, Steve discovers that Nathaniel was a student at Julliard, who mysteriously dropped out in 1970. Through Grant's narrative we learn that the musical genius Nathaniel may have battled schizophrenia since childhood.""The Soloist"" follows Steve's journey to salvage Nathaniel's life. Wright and Grant also make us aware of the plight of the homeless in Los Angeles, and the efforts of such noble causes as LAMP. They also provide insight into the pain and suffering of the mentally ill and challenged. To that end Jaime Foxx is defined authenticity. As Nathaniel, Foxx brilliantly stays the course, because his character will not change. That transformation is left to Downey's Steve, who must deliver on their partnership. Downey astounds. He is so believable and compelling as the good and decent man doing his best, and at a loss as to what to do. At one story arc, Nathaniel tells Steve, ""I love you."" That is not what Steve wanted to hear, because now he is responsible for another. He confesses to the LAMP director, ""I don't want to be his only thing!""The most astounding thing about Downey's compassionate performance is displayed when he is listening and in his silence. There is a breathtaking scene where Steve gives Nathaniel a cello, and eyes widen as he listens to Nathaniel play. He and Foxx have a touching screen partnership. I was in awe in a scene where Downey and Foxx sit together and listen to a Los Angeles Symphony rehearsal at the Disney Concert Hall.""The Soloist"" at times is off paced and is distracted by some narrative turns. However, it has great heart. Jaime Foxx is compelling and true. Robert Downey Jr. is electrifying. This is truly his movie—he is awesome. In the words of Downey's Steve, ""Being his friend will carry you home."" See ""The Soloist"", and allow yourself to be moved.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Squandered Potential,"This movie could have been magnificent. It could have soared, could have portrayed the shattering tragedy that is the epidemic of homelessness and abject poverty of the inner cities, and it could have equally conveyed the conflictual relationship between the comparatively well-off but shallow everyman reporter and his beautifully flawed subject.But it didn't, and it wasn't. Despite extraordinary musical sequences, a touching and accurate performance by Foxx and some very creative camera work, it feels forced, shallow and bitter. The directing was glamorous and sappy, and the film seems to fawn on itself and it's own significance even as it drowns in hopelessness, confusion and despair. The only real saving grace of the movie aside from Jamie Foxx's acting is the all-too-brief sequences showing what life as one of the forgotten members of society is really like -- the junkies and crazies, abandoned to subsist in filth and squalor on the hideous underbelly of Los Angeles. That, the film did well. And only that.Downey, usually electric and charismatic on-screen, is completely unlikeable and frantic as Steve Lopez, a wayward reporter thirsting for a good story. I realize I may garner a great deal of dissent from his powerful fan-base, but I found his portrayal to be inconsistent, cynical and (most distractingly) incredibly strange -- scenes which should have been emotional and riveting are sadly hilarious with Downey's bizarre facial expressions and eccentric mannerisms. His way of speaking is so peculiar he's at times difficult to understand; his reactions so uncalled for and inappropriate it's difficult to imagine anyone, even a homeless schizophrenic, being desperate enough for his treacherous and self- centered ""friendship"". His nervous energy and off-key interactions become increasingly painful to watch as the movie becomes steadily more serious, and the only emotion in the entire film he manages to summon are weepy doe-eyes that feel obviously manipulative and an utterly besotted, love-struck, soppy smile that he sends Foxx's way in a feeble imitation of what was in real life a touching heterosexual male relationship. He fluctuates rapidly between what appears to be an ardent, homo-erotic adoration of Foxx to a vicious, whiny rejection. Downey's is one of the most unsympathetic performances I've seen in a long, long while.Foxx, conversely, portrays to near perfection the anguish and innocence of a disabling mental illness. His character is a homeless, schizophrenic former Juilliard musician who wanders the streets of LA with his shabby violin and constant self-narration. His acting is haunting and real, and what may oft be misinterpreted as aloofness on Foxx's part is in fact a realistic portrayal of the flatness of schizophrenics. It's faintly ridiculous to see such talent as Jamie Foxx paired with such shallow madness as Robert Downey Jr.Overall, the film becomes an unwittingly parallel to the man it set out to portray -- like Nathaniel Anthony Ayers himself, it started out with remarkable potential and deteriorated into an aimless entanglement of its former merits.A tragic fable, indeed.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Unexpectedly deep, but lacks focus","Previews and marketing for The Soloist give a very different image of what the film actually is about. Watching the trailer, one would think, ""Oh, here's another 'feel good white-guy- meets-black-guy movie where the black guy is sincere but troubled and the white guy wants to help him but can't relate to him and has a short temper but it's okay because in the end they both learn from each others' differences' with a musical backdrop thrown in just for artistic interest- lovely! Exactly what I need to watch to feel better on a Saturday evening!""The reality is in fact the opposite- the story ends on a somber note, occasionally plunging into melodrama, but the 'feel-good' market is indeed misleading. This is a movie that wants, tries desperately, to touch on some very serious issues, but unfortunately causes itself to become undone as a movie.The story revolves around an LA Times columnist named Steve Lopez who stumbles across n eccentric and mentally ill homeless musician, Nathaniel, who is a musical prodigy and a Julliard dropout. At first obsessed with the story, Steve inevitably becomes involved in Nathaniel's personal life while dealing with his own issues with his ex-wife and his job.That's all you really need to know, but even if I wanted to try to explain it further, that would prove rather difficult because the film itself doesn't even really know what it's about- is it about finding the kindness to be someone's friend, the homeless crisis in LA, dealing with people with schizophrenia, pursuing your dreams, coming to terms with not living your dreams, or even more basic, is it about Nathaniel or is it about Steve? The movie doesn't know as it bombards you with as much information as you could possibly need to know about any of that, whether its via flashback sequences about Nathaniel's past, moments where ""the voices"" invade Nathaniel's head and freak him out, overly dramatic scenes involving policemen arresting homeless people, an excessive amount of really irrelevant time in Steve's office and about a head injury of his, and multiple musical montage scenes to Beethoven, one involving helicopter shots and pigeons, and another involving an uninterrupted three minutes of color splashing across the screen rhythmically.With that said, it's very well-acted. When director Joe Wright isn't throwing as many different things together in the editing room as he possibly can, Robert Downery Jr. and Jamie Foxx put together a fantastic on-screen duo that actually manages to defy the clichés that one might expect. Jamie Foxx especially makes the character his own to the extent that he is almost unrecognizable, both in speech, mannerism, and physical appearance from anything else he's ever done. The two of them together make the film memorable and it is their lack of ability to understand one another that essential makes the best drama of the film. Without it, everything else going on in Steve's life- the quest for the next big story and the problems with the ex-wife, falls flat of any real dramatic significance.The film wants to be so much. It wants to be so much so badly it feels like it doesn't even care if it's a movie at all. It has moments of ingenuity, but it could've been so much more powerful if it were just a story about either one man's love for music or one man's choice to change someone else's life rather than trying to throw as many different punches as possible.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
strong performances in a so-so film,"In 2005, the Los Angeles Times published a series of articles by reporter Steve Lopez profiling a classical music virtuoso he found living - and playing his two-string violin - on the streets of Skid Row. After spending many hours with his subject, Lopez learned that Nathaniel Ayers' promising career as a musician was cut tragically short in the early 1970s when he fell victim to schizophrenia - he began hearing voices that crowded out his ability to think clearly and function in the real world - while still a student at Julliard. Inspired both by the human interest potential of the story, as well as by a sincere desire to extend a helping hand to a fellow human being in need, Lopez touched an emotional chord in his readers, shining a spotlight on the very real problems of homelessness and mental illness, while, at the same time, turning Ayres into something of a household name.With selected passages from the articles serving as voice-over narration, ""The Soloist,"" adapted by Susannah Grant, features Robert Downey Jr. as the well-meaning writer who, in the midst of his personal crusade, comes to question just how much good one human being can do for another when the object of those intentions is either already too far gone to be successfully reached or simply unwilling to accept any proffer of assistance from a caring stranger. Jamie Foxx plays Ayres, the mentally ill prodigy who speaks like Rain Man yet plays the cello like Rostropovich. Both actors are excellent in their roles, with Foxx, in particular, avoiding the temptation of overplaying his hand in a part that seems tailor-made to garner critical acclaim and award nominations.The performances are certainly the best things going for ""The Soloist,"" for, without them, the movie might well have ended up choking on its own sanctimony and noble intentions. Joe Wright, who did much better by ""Atonement"" a few years back, here tries to gussy things up with a plethora of fancy directorial touches - birds soaring to the music, endless helicopter shots of the city, laser light shows serving as visual correlatives to the classical pieces being played - but no amount of showiness can keep the drama from remaining frustratingly earthbound, pedestrian and plodding. Luckily, the screenplay avoids becoming as syrupy and sentimental as it clearly might have given the Humanity-of-Man nature of the material, and the story itself is interesting enough on its own to overcome the rather indifferent treatment it receives at the hands of the filmmakers. Moreover, the movie does bring out into the open the shamelessly overlooked plight of the homeless and mentally ill in our urban centers. For that reason alone, it serves a salutary purpose.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
good acting but...,"didn't seem very original. I guess that's why this movie didn't do very well at the theater. The movie is about a news columnist, Steve, that starts a conversation with a homeless person, Nathaniel, whom he finds playing a broken violin. Nathaniel tells him he is a Julliard drop out, and Steve sees an opportunity to turn this into a story. He tracks him down and asks him more questions and when the first column comes out, a reader sends Nathaniel a cello, which is what he originally played. Steve gives him the cello and it leads to him trying to help Nathaniel get off the streets and get him involved with the local sympathy.Foxx and Downey were good.

The overall story wasn't good enough and there wasn't a lot that happened.FINAL VERDICT: I only recommend it if you are a fan of one of the stars.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Wright, Downey and Foxx are good enough artists to lift this above its Oscar bait plot","This film was supposed to be a major competitor for the Oscars last year, but Paramount bumped it to a few months later. Despite the mixed reviews the film has received, I believe it would have been a major contender. I honestly think Paramount's decision not only ruined its chances for Oscars, it gave the impression that there was something wrong with the picture. There isn't, really. The subject matter does scream ""Oscar Bait"", with Robert Downey Jr. playing a newspaper columnist who writes about a schizophrenic genius musician (Jamie Foxx) who is homeless on the streets of L.A. We all remember Shine. Shine was pretty good (if entirely made up, as we later discovered). The Soloist is probably a little better. I think it's stronger because of its exploration of the relationship between the two central characters. Both Downey and Foxx are extremely good; both are award-worthy. This material could easily have been cheesy Oscar bait, but director Joe Wright (Pride and Prejudice and Atonement) is a virtuoso himself. The way he uses image and sound move the story along beautifully, not allowing the clichés to clog up the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Shows how great Wright is as a director,"The Soloist- *** This movie is a test in my eyes, showing how great of a director Joe Wright is, for those of you who were unsure. This is the man who brought us the fantastic 2005 version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" and 2007's wonderful ""Atonement"". With those movies, he was working with great stories based on best selling novels. Here, he is working from the source material of an author, but it is a story that is very cliché.The author is Steve Lopez, who is played by Robert Downey Jr., who's life was changed after he meets a homeless man, Nathaniel Ayers, who sits in a traffic tunnel, with his cello, beautifully playing classical music. Lopez, in the film, is divorced, broken and lost. Even though the real Lopez is happily married and one of the L.A. Times most valuable resources, I understand why they made slight changes to the character. This is a typical Hollywood feel good story, right down to the forced moments of emotion with the instrumental music kicking in even more than usual.This movie was supposed to come out in the Fall of 2008, upgrading its chance to garner some Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor and etc. Shortly before it was supposed to be released, the movie was puled from its date and placed in a spring time slot. When this happened, many questioned how good it actually was.As stated before, the movie is not bad, it is actually well made for what it was, but it is all too familiar. The performances are even very well done, Downey Jr. and Foxx have great chemistry. Separately, they are even great. Downey, gives his character a vulnerable charm that comes across quite well. Foxx, who could of just made Nathaniel a one dimensional character, makes the role something worth the price of admission.As I write this review, I have really no desire to go into it.

Uninspired retread of well-known morals,"I'm hoping that The Soloist will come across as one of the most disappointing movies of 2009, because if we get anything more of a letdown than this it's gonna be pretty bad. I awaited the movie with enormous anticipation. Jamie Foxx has proved himself as a tremendously talented actor many times over, and Robert Downey Jr., long since one of my favorite actors, is at the height of his career with his work in movies like Iron Man and Tropic Thunder, as well as the upcoming Sherlock Holmes, Master Mind, The Avengers, and Iron Man 2.Now, I hope I can say this without sounding like I'm really bashing the movie, because it is competently made and competently acted, but there were points in the movie where the pure badness almost approached camp. There is no doubt that the movie was green-lighted and cast with visions of Oscars dancing in the heads of Jamie Foxx, Robert Downey Jr. and the movie's producers, but somewhere along the way there was a necessary element that just never made it into the final cut. The movie definitely has it's fans and it certainly is a moving story, but I can tell you with pretty strong certainty that there are no Oscars in The Soloist's future.That being said, I should probably also admit that I had the hardest time putting my finger on exactly what went wrong. Maybe it is something as simple as a permeating lack of originality. Maybe the presentation of a mentally ill main character was handled without the necessary subtlety or authenticity. In Tropic Thunder, Robert Downey Jr. himself expounded on the dangers of an actor going full retard, maybe this is a case of what happens when you go 'full crazy?' Whatever the case, I am truly sorry to say that both stars have scenes where their performances come across as almost bizarrely cheesy.Of course it might be just me, but I doubt it.Robert Downey Jr. plays Steve Lopez, a Los Angeles Times columnist desperate for a good story, when he one day runs into Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx), a homeless man with obviously tremendous musical talent. There goes cliché number one. Through a muddled combination of personal interest and hope for the betterment of Ayers' life, Lopez makes it his life's to get Ayers off the streets, on medication, and into a successful musical career where he belongs.It's hard not to be moved by such a story, but it's also hard to find anything original in it. It's based on a true story, even to the point of showing an incident where an elderly LA Times reader sent in her own cello, one she had been playing herself for decades, because she was so moved by Lopez's story about Ayers. The movie's presentation of this event is one of its simplest but best scenes.But after thatwhat? I won't ruin the story for you, because while I found the movie disappointing, I would also say that it's not disappointing to the point that people shouldn't watch it. But it leaves you with a definite feeling that it should have been something more, or that the true story on which it's based simply doesn't have the ingredients for a successful drama. There is a point in the movie, for example, where Ayers utters the line, ""If I ever see you again I'll cut you open and gut you like a fish."" I appreciate the portrayal of paralyzing mental confusion, but I'm going to go ahead and suggest the majority of the audience is going to see that as a good time to turn your life- saving mission over to professionals who have some idea of what they're dealing with.Then again, it's also exactly this kind of difficulty that has led to the most satisfying struggles against the odds in similarly uplifting movies, but The Soloist argues that friendship should be enough to overcome even the most insurmountable barriers, it takes us on this painful struggle with a damaged mind, and then, worst of all, it all leads up to one of those stupid, stupid voice-over speeches at the end that's supposed to tie everything up with a cute little bow. God I can't stand that.Watch the movie when it comes out on DVD. It's not a complete failure, but it is much less than the sum of its parts and it gives that feeling that it is always just about to develop into something really great but it just never happens. It does a good job of approaching the difficult paradox of how far people should be able to go in efforts to force a better life on someone, but for all of the ambition clearly involved in its production, it should easily have forced out a much better movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
A good film but we saw it already as Shine,"A journalist searching for a story comes across a homeless schizophrenic, Nathaniel, who, as it turns out, is also a classically-trained musician. The journalist befriends him, allowing him to play his music, while writing articles about him that force a showdown of sorts in their relationship.Based on a true story, this film pushes most of the right emotional button, but suffers from an unavoidable comparison with Shine. Bromance versus romance aside, there is too much overlap in the stories, even if they are true, robbing The Soloist of any freshness. Foxx is excellent, albeit in that actor-after-Oscar mode that seems to draw certain performers to play mentally diminished characters. Downey is as charismatic as ever, if a little more clipped than usual. The extras are in fact real homeless people with real mental infirmities - faced with that, Downey seems to have opted to play it a little more sombre than usual. At one point, he reacts to a stream of consciousness by one of the homeless people and we glimpse the man rather than the character. It is a fascinating moment - you realise that no matter how hard films try to approach realism, the real world will always prove more surprising.One small triumph for me is the moment where Nathaniel gets to hear a full orchestra for the first time. He closes his eyes, and we are treated to an abstract light show representing his emotional elation to the music. Director Wright apparently shot that sequence with a whisky glass and a household lamp. In our CGI-infested times, that is refreshing.In sum, not a bad film, and possibly more if you have not seen Shine.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Schizo street musician hits the right notes in performance,"A nice movie to watch in my opinion with a terrific acting performance by Jamie Fox as Nathaniel Ayers and Robert Downey supports well as the encouraging journalist. Perhaps someone can enlighten us what the outcome of the movie is/was and what it did achieve for Nathaniels future life but I know its a sensitive true story and Jamie Fox and Robert Downey acted their respective parts perfectly. I agree with earlier comment that there was sometimes too much dwelling and focus on the Downey rather than fox character. The title was after all named for the street musician and not the journalist and in many ways it did pose questions what was the motive for Downey (Lopez) in pursuit of Nathaniels promotion and the story which he ultimately told. As a film per se, it is very good and I personally think Jamie fox is worthy of Oscar nomination for 2010 (though I don't understand how the timing of film release for Oscars works).

Lacks inspiration of the human spirit,"When I saw the trailer for this film, I had somewhat decent expectations for it, it wasn't high enough for me to rush out to theaters and watch it but thought it would be a decent and inspiring film, but was left disappointed. I haven't seen a movie about music for a while, especially about classical music so I decided to give this film a try. And the story follows the simple formula of a chance encounter changes a man's life. But this film just drags and drags to the point you feel like falling asleep, what they did was take a simple story and made it run longer than it should have. Cause you could simply tell the creators was running out of ideas, cause it didn't go anywhere. Just a white man constantly trying to a help a black man, but the black man is ungrateful cause he hits the black man for trying to help him although black man says stuff along the lines of loving him even if he has schizophrenia. Even if this is based on a true story, it is very difficult to buy into Robert Downey Jr's character and why he is trying so hard to help Jamie Foxx's character. I will however say that Robert and Jamie give good performances and as far as dramas go I seen way worse, this one is just not that interesting.

"an inspirational story that doesn't inspire, for all that it tries and might aspire to be","I went into the Soloist not won over by the trailer. Indeed I thought it looked like something that we see in Hollywood from time to time, which is a hyped-up story of an underdog with not all his screws tied up being inspirational to those who are down on their luck. It looked like, frankly, pablum. But I also thought that an actor such as Robert Downey Jr being in the film might mean some promise, something stimulating about the project that would attract someone like him, one of the best American actors working today. Turns out, this is not the case.What attracted Downey Jr I can't say; was it the material, the true life story of Steve Lopez's chronicling of Nathanial Ayers Jr, or was it Joe Wright, the director of Atonement at the helm? All of these questions can be asked, but what we're left with is the film itself, and left to judge it on what is here. What the Soloist is is an overwrought, crammed-up and morally questionable presentation of a story that, frankly, doesn't give much uplift when the lights come up. The story of Ayers, a schizophrenic who happens to be a virtuoso musician living on the streets of LA and connecting somehow with a sympathetic columnist, is one where there really isn't hope, despite what the trailers and ads might say.In fact, I believe, a moral of the story would be: ""yeah, try as you might to be a 'friend', whatever that means in this context, but these 'people' on the streets, whatever they're qualities and talents that are apparent, should be left alone and without much medication to get them in a better frame of mind if at all possible."" At the end we're given a tacked-on catharsis statement from Lopez on how Ayers affected him, but it's not very inspirational. It's just sad, and not in that fulfilling kind of way.The makers of the Soloist probably thought they were making a grand statement on the power of friendship and connecting with the mentally ill. But there are so many other films that one could spend there time with, given all of the promising ingredients here. If you want to see a movie about a relatively normal guy and a mentally warped guy watch Rainman; if you want to watch good Downey Jr movies watch his output last year; for Foxx, 2004's output (especially Collateral); for classical music put to dizzying visual heights, Fantasia (which, I should add, Wright desperately tries to emulate in the scene where Lopez and Ayers see the recital and all of those colors flash through his mind ending with the pretentious line: ""Beethoven is in the room"").On top of Wright crowding in FAR too much into making it a feat of the visual, even when it's not needed to express something about the story or the characters or mood (and an inconsistent one at that as it moves jarringly between flights of fancy like the shot careening across the sky with birds flying around to, yes, a documentary interlude on the homeless), Foxx goes way too over-the-top in his performance. There is nigh a shred of subtlety, and even if this is the point which it well may be I was never really convinced or drawn in to this real person, Nathanial Ayers, who apparently still is on the streets of LA mumbling and playing wonderful music. Downey Jr still does what he can with his character, and actually does pull us in with his conflict of his profession and his feelings for this man he looks after.But one actor can't really save what is ultimately a heavy-handed story of inspiration that lacks inspiration or triumph-of-the-human-spirit element to make it worthwhile. It's simply another Hollywood vehicle for hope that tries too hard and not hard enough. Wright may be a talent to watch, and Atonement showed those sparks, but it's not here.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
I CERTAINLY ENJOYED THIS IMMENSELY! YOU WILL TOO!,"The SOLOIST is anything but typical. It tells an extremely interesting and unusual story which refuses to conform to the formulaic conventions to which we have, unfortunately, become so complacently accustomed.There are three factors which contribute to creating false expectations for SOLOIST. First, the title itself is somewhat misleading. Watch the movie, and you'll see for yourself!Second, the trailer or previews is edited so as to create expectations geared to coincide more with the genre's formulaic audience comfort zone. The very thing the movie so painstakingly avoids! 😊😊And third, the very same set of entrenched genre conventions we have already mentioned, that many people bring with them when viewing!Putting all of this aside, SOLOIST derives its tremendous energy and appeal from the undeniable on-screen chemistry of Robert Downey, Jr. And Jamie Foxx. Their interaction is a joy to watch. The story does provide the standard genre buzz-words...
Uplifting, inspirational and motivational...but for reasons that would be virtually impossible to predict before experiencing the film itself!Oh, and the music is absolutely sublime! Lover's of classical music are in for a veritable treat! There are elements of SOLOIST that will make some viewers squirm. Third world neighborhoods, right here, in downtown Los Angeles, for example!Scenes from SOLOIST have been ricocheting around my brain since viewing it yesterday!9.5*** STARS

A Educational Thought!!!,"I think everybody should watch this movie because it's educational, This is what people should know about mental illness if they have any friends or loved ones suffering of that illness. (Robert Downey Jr.) character, display the amount of stress, patients and tolerance one should indure towards people with mental illness, not forgetting the support towards them that can help them recover and try live normal lives.The movie also shows us that those patients must drink their medications to help them cope in this world, otherwise, without medication, its bad, they can't live normal lives.From my point of view, People who are diagnosed with bipolar or schizophrenia or any other mental illness, they are not suppose to have a right to refuse medication.

Not for us!,"Dire!. Not a film that worked for me or the friends I sat and watched it with. The story was too thin, poorly scripted and in my opinion poorly directed. One of it's many sins was the scene which involved a kaleidescope of colours which changed and kept in sync with the music which was playing in the background?. I am amazed anyone thought that scene would be visually entertaining or that it would 'add' something to the film. The mental heath issues suffered by main character was drawn out and constantly revisited. Once you've established his state of mind I see little reason to keep banging on about it. The film also failed to tell us enough about the main characters for us to get drawn in, by the and of the film I felt little sympathy for them and was pleased it was over.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Downey and Foxx make a great team,"There was a statistic they showed at the end of the film that shocked me. It pointed out that there are 90,000 homeless in Los Angeles on any given day. This film is a searing indictment of the shameful way we treat both the mentally ill and the homeless. Jamie Foxx is riveting in his portrayal of a schizophrenic with a talent for music. His character reminded me of the one in that movie A Beautiful Mind. We see the hellish torment this poor man lives with every day. Its almost like he's trapped in a prison with no way out. Robert Downey Jr. was so funny in last year's Tropic Thunder, he proves here that he is good at doing drama as well. He is wonderful as a weary, sardonic reporter who in a way finds personal redemption when he decides to do a story on this poor homeless man with a genius for music. Foxx and Downey both have great chemistry and I wouldn't be surprised if they both get Oscar nods.",,Anonymous,Music
Not Bad,"It's marketed as a two-handed performance-heavy piece, & it delivers fully on that front. Foxx & Downey are both in top form, ably delivering the heartfelt & relatively unique dialogue. The problem is that, in its worst moments, it's a mess of racial & cultural insensitivities, mainly presenting black people as crazy, criminal, or both, with the not-so-hidden stench of a white-savior narrative. Still, Wright's passionate & careful direction mixed with Foxx & Downey makes for something worth sifting through.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"""Very heartfelt, very true, and great acting. Don't pass this one up.""","On a Sunday afternoon I found myself rummaging through the HBO on-demand offerings. I past over 'The Soloist' a couple of times only remembering the first time I tried to watch it when I fell asleep before the end of the first act. My fiancé sat beside me when I found nothing else to watch, and decided to give Jamie Foxx as Nathanial Anthony Ayers Jr. another try. The first 30 minutes felt familiar as I remembered the opening scenes. I instantly became sucked into the story.Steve Lopez (Downey Jr.) is a columnist of the LA Times who is in desperate need of story. Out wandering around LA, Lopez heres the soft music of a violin with only 2 strings. There he finds the Julliard dropout, Nathanial Ayers (Foxx). Somewhat hard to follow at times, Ayers explains parts of his past to Lopez over several days. Lopez writes of Ayers and one of his readers respond. Lopez is sent a like-new cello to give to Ayers. Steve Lopez sets up a place for Nathanial to play and be safe. Over the next several months, Lopez tries to get into Ayers' head and find the source of the his assumed mental illness.The two main characters, Ayers & Lopez, often are seen clicking like best friends and at other times tugging back and forth of the simplest of subjects. Downey Jr. and Foxx fit into these roles perfectly. Their on screen chemistry makes me want more movies just like this.As this movie is based on the real life story of the two main characters, it is almost exactly adapted from the book written by Steve Lopez. This book entitled The Soloist: A Lost Dream, an Unlikely Friendship, and the Redemptive Power of Music, was written about Lopez's encounters with Ayers during his column writing.Very heartfelt, very true, and great acting.

Sheer Inspiration - Listen to a Soul and Really See Them...,"There are certain instruments that fill the Soul with such longing, comfort and Heart all rolled into one. The Cello, Oboe and the Violin are all in that category. And there are points when this movie brings you to tears with just the sound of the Cello alone...Jamie Foxx and Robert Downey Jr., the Director and crew... out did themselves. Thank you one and all!Back East classical music fills the air with open amphitheaters and impromptu's. However, the West coast is filled with IPods and MP3s and only the annual Festivals fill the air. Yet, such music as This is worth more than any electronic - It is the sound of Love. The sound of Heaven kissing the Soul of Mankind....with Grace.90,000 is probably a low estimate, the homeless travel and migrate. I rarely travel to the cities and when I do, the homeless is usually what I see - that and healthy people walking past sick people. On one occasion, the circumference of the homeless man's legs measured 2 inches thick and his legs poke out from newspaper covers. He slept during the day so that he could protect himself during the night...It broke my Heart.Yet they are not alone. The last 11 months have been a series of visits among family and friends during my own homelessness. Even today, I sleep on the floor cleaning a house in exchange for free rent - waiting to become a tenant in a handful of days. Hoping and praying that December can be filled with a normal experience - the joy of Christmas. And hoping and praying that HUD will choose to pay a portion of the rent. You see I am Fortunate. I still have a mind clear enough, family and friends deep enough and a working concept of nutrition. I am well off compared to people like Mr. Ayers; as this movie exposes - most homeless do not.Somewhere our country lost a Great Truth - not everyone can be a viable citizen - every waking moment of awareness. As a Nation, we let go of the insane asylum concept in the 70's and left nothing in its vacuum. The churches scrambled to fill it - yet most lost funding. In the 90's, halfway houses were developed and most California counties survive on this answer. It is a good answer, yet as we can see, not every individual can embrace being inside.Somewhere in our Nation's future, we need to build viable, renewable gardens for the homeless. A Skid row with food growing on the walls. Why? Because the answer for most of today's mental illness is found in the healing power of food and today, we have viable methods for growing food vertically. America needs self-sustaining answers for the long-term.Fore the very Soul of a Homeless man is as Beautiful as any healthy citizen on the grid - they have simply lost the ability to articulate it and communicate it - and their citizenship is just as important as our own. Why? Because we are stronger together than apart.Thank you again Cast, Crew and Scriptwriter. ""It was beautiful.""",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Strong performances, unsatisfying story line","I was expecting much from this film and was disappointed. The fault is not that of the two leads, both of whom did well; I enjoyed Robert Downey Jr.'s performance as the reporter, and as the homeless man, Foxx may have earned himself another Oscar nomination. But the plot was lacking. Yes, it's based on a true story, and a glossy traditional Hollywood ending was neither wanted nor possible. But I think the story's focus was wrong. I expected, and wanted, to see the story of a musical prodigy whose talent was lost to mental illness; but this is the reporter's story instead, of his evolution from seeing the homeless man first as a story, then as a project, then as a human being. It's a familiar plot in fiction and non-fiction, and one not particularly well done here. I didn't get enough sense of who Foxx's character was before he landed on the street, of what the decades of his illness had been like, of what he and his talent had meant to his family. And we see almost nothing of his interactions with his peers at Juilliard. Because we don't see much of what his life was like before his descent into schizophrenia, we don't have the powerful sense of loss we should have when we're brought back to the present and see the broken mumbling man guarding his cart full of trash. Instead the film gets caught up in sensationalistic (and admittedly powerful) depictions of the squalor and ruined faces of skid row. But I've seen depictions of homelessness elsewhere. I wanted to know the story of this lost prodigy, and I didn't see it. The film even wastes time on silly touches such as the Downey character's fumbles with his cellphone at the public toilet and his getting coyote urine spilled all over himself as he tries to battle raccoons. Comic relief for adolescent boys, perhaps, but I don't think many of them will be coming to see this movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
A solid and engaging film in the main that only hurts itself when it does give way to sentimentality (although this is not too often),"When it came out in the UK (which was sometime after it came out in the US) there was still some lingering talk of Oscars which is sort of par for the course in any film where a famous actor is playing a character with a mental illness etc. As it transpired, the film wasn't there when the names were called and in some areas (acting) I think that is a shame because while the film has its problems it is actually a very engaging piece. The plot follows a journalist (Steve Lopez) as he finds a homeless man (Nathaniel Ayers) playing violin on the street with a skill far in excess of that which his appearance would suggest him capable of. As he tries to help this man and get a story out of it, Lopez finds out more about the plight of the homeless in LA.The film never quite becomes as smug and curt as my potted plot summary makes it sound but I will say that there is an atmosphere of hand-wringing to the film that it never totally loses – it is not overpowering but it is in the air and you never forget it is there for very long. This manifests itself in the nature of the telling as we very much have Lopez as the main character but it also comes from the unnecessary excesses when it comes to the wider issues of homelessness. This is most evident in the terrible clips over the end credits (talk about overegging the cake) but it is also in the main film when it goes all hand-wringing over ""what's to be done"" and also visually and audibly gushes over the healing power of music. It is a shame because otherwise the film does maintain a fairly even keel and manages something close to restraint, particularly when the scenes are squarely in the hands of the lead two actors – scenes where director Wright actually does well to be as matter-of-fact as he is.Ignoring the liberties taken with the fact (which will not even occur to most casual viewers – myself included) we actually have a very solid story in this odd relationship. The characters are not excessively polished and nor are the performances pushed out in the hope of an award. Credit to Jamie Foxx because this is the sort of thing where it could all be played out over soft music and where there could have been several ""big"" scenes where the Oscar clip is in the mind. On the contrary, Foxx is restrained and convincing and you feel for his character all the more for it, he doesn't have one ""big"" scene where everything is laid out but both he and the film are better for it. Downey benefits from the material not leaving Lopez as either a blank plot device or as some sort of saint, rather his motives are always questionable and his ability to do anything is not exaggerated. This gives Downey more to play with and he does very well with it – again he is never showy or give ""one big moment"" but he is consistently good and he works very well with Foxx. Keener has a small role without too much to do (but still manages to be a quality presence as ever) while Hollander and Hamilton are both good but also rather odd finds for viewers of The Thick of It and True Blood respectively.Overall The Soloist ironically may have been more successful had it really turned up the sentimental music and gone the whole weepy route, but it would have been a lesser film. As it is, it is not perfect and does give way to sweeping generalisations and slight sentimentality when it comes to the music and the wider issues, but in the main story it is sturdy, reliable and quite emotionally balanced. It is also helped a great deal that both Foxx and Downey are happy with this approach and pitch their engaging performances accordingly. Not a brilliant film but certainly one worth seeing.",,Anonymous,Music
"When Jamie Foxx Moves From The Piano To The Violin, Not As Great","Columnist Steve Lopez (Robert Downey Jr.) is at a dead end. The newspaper business is in an uproar, his marriage to a fellow journalist has fallen apart and he can't entirely remember what he loved about his job in the first place. Then, one day, while walking through Los Angeles' Skid Row, he sees the mysterious bedraggled figure Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx), pouring his soul into a two-stringed violin.At first, Lopez approaches Ayers as just another story idea in a city of millions. But as he begins to unearth the mystery of how this alternately brilliant and distracted street musician, once a dynamic prodigy headed for fame, wound up living in tunnels and doorways, it sparks an unexpected quest. Imagining he can change Ayers' life, Lopez embarks on a quixotic mission to get him off the streets and back to the world of music.But even as he fights to save Ayers' life, he begins to see that it is Ayers—with his unsinkable passion, his freedom-loving obstinacy and his valiant attempts at connection and love—who is profoundly changing Lopez.

A tough but fair look at mental illness and poverty.,"You are here: Home » The SoloistThe SoloistRate ThisIn 2009 Jamie Foxx and Robert Downey Jr. teamed up in this amazing film. Based on a true story the film focuses on the meeting between Nathaniel Ayers (Foxx) and Steve Lopez (Downey). Lopez is a columnist for the Los Angeles Times who needs a new story. While in the park he discovers Ayers playing the violin. Soon he discovers that this homeless man is a former student from Julliard and an amazing musical talent. The challenge for Lopez is his desire to help Nathaniel reclaim his life and his talent. Steve's attempts to do this lead him on a journey to discovery of much more.This is a great watch. I enjoyed every minute and all aspects of the film worked well together. The acting is incredible as both of the stars worked to pull off this amazing story. Foxx had an especially daunting task as he portrayed a man suffering from debilitating mental illness.The cinematography in this film is also incredible. Each of the scenes seems perfectly framed and captures the feeling of the moment. The music that is used throughout the film lends itself to the emotion as well.I would strongly recommend this film for anyone. It's not a children's movie but it's still got a family film feel to it. the depiction of the lives of the homeless and mentally ill can be tough at times, but as a whole the film has a redeeming quality.I give this film 3.5 stars out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Has a Different Kind of Hope,"Got a chance to see the Soloist the other night. It wasn't something I planned on watching. In greater Raleigh, there is still a $1.50 theater, one of those grand places where you can catch a cheap flick on the big screen. The group I was with picked The Soloist as the film to see, and I was fine with paying $1.50. I had heard some not-so-good reviews of the film. Some said it had no point. Some said the thought the movie had no hope at the end. I found that I enjoyed the film and totally ""got it."" I thought this film showed in a concrete way that you can't force someone to change unless they are ready.This is based on a true story, and it's believable. Steve Lopez (Robert Downy, Jr in another great role) is a cynical journalist. He knows how to find the good story out of the most mundane circumstances. He isn't above interviewing anyone if it means he will get some readers to enjoy his column. He makes a personal bike accident sound thoughtful and provoking, as he rhapsodizes about the state of a neighborhood hospital.One day he comes upon Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx) , who is homeless and rambles when he talks. Yet he tells Lopez that he used to attend Julliard. After checking out his story, Lopez takes a special interest in Ayers and decides he would make a good human interest piece. Lopez interviews him and listens to him play, but it's all word related---at first. Then he starts to get involved in Ayer's life, and he begins to take a genuine interest in Ayers. Lopez sees the talent in Ayers and he wants to see that talent get used. Here is where I think the movie flopped in most people's eyes.We all love an underdog story. We want to see that homeless person defeat all of his monsters and settle down in a nice, normal life. Lopez wants him in an apartment, possibly giving concerts and sharing his music with the world. And if he (Lopez) gets some of the credit for bring this talent to light, well that's quite all right with him. In the traditional film, Ayers would have pulled himself up by his bootstraps and live happily ever after. We like that.What happens instead is much more realistic and true. I won't spoil the ending for you, but we don't get the happily ever after ending. We do see hope in this film, and a life is changed, but I would argue that the life most changed is Lopez himself. He's the typical cynical, hardworking journalist. He's worked hard all of his life and managed to push all of his meaningful relationships away. Robert Downy, Jr. is the right combination of rugged, cynical, selfish, and flawed to play this role. Jamie Foxx gives a great performance as a mentally ill man with demons in his past and a child's heart. When he listens to music, his eyes shine and we want to feel what he is feeling.Besides the acting, the most notable thing about this film is its portrait of the homeless community. Lopez tells Ayers if he wants to play the cello that a reader donated, he will have to play in the homeless shelter. Ayers is terrified to go down there. To get to the shelter, you have to dodge drug dealers, panhandlers, prostitutes, and more. The shelter itself is run by a kindly man (Nelsan Ellis) who sees through Lopez's ""good deeds"" to his conditional love for Ayers. There are some beautiful scenes that take place in this shelter where Ayers plays his cello for the homeless residents. And it's like a soothing balm.I have been to feed the homeless events, and I saw the faces of the people I had fed as I watched this film. Sometimes it's hard for us to understand why many homeless don't take advantage of the services available to them. I think this film shows that it's not always easy to get to those places, first of all, and even when you arrive, there is often mental illness that stops people from getting the help they need.I recommend this film. It's well worth a rental.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Most Predictable Movie of the Year,"What could have been an engaging-and emotionally charged character study is totally undermined by the predictable factor. Fox is OK as Nathaniel Ayers, the Julliard trained musician who dreams of playing with the Walt Disney orchestra until his bouts with schizophrenia drive him into the street and ultimately skid row. Looking for a good story to boost his flagging career, reporter Steve Lopez {Robert ""rehab"" Downey } gets to know him and tells his story. Taking every element of the classic ""how we hit the skids"" movies, borrowing very liberally from ""A Beautiful Mind"", taking the bogus ""feel good"" attitude of films like ""Rocky""-you pick the sequel number-and whipping up too much 1930s style melodrama all that is left on the screen is a burnt out shell of a movie. It is corny, trite, utterly predictable and plays way too often on our sentiments. I hate to say it, but this is the kind of movie that, if you say you hated it, people will give you bad looks.

"Great performances, but it's nowhere near as deep as it likes to believe it is.","The Soloist disappointed me in many ways. The performances are not a problem, Robert Downey Jr. and Jamie Foxx are both absolutely tremendous, but the movie itself is good at best. When this 1st arrived on the scene, I think a lot of people expected awards and nominations for best actor for both, but in the end it really didn't live up to the high expectations it had for itself. The main problem with The Soloist for me was it felt too cold a lot of the time. As much of the pain I felt for Nathaniel|Foxx| I had a lot of trouble warming up to him, and despite the fact that Steve Lopez|Downey| changes a bit neat the end, I also questioned his motives many times. I was also a bit frustrated that I didn't get all the background info I wanted for Nathaniel. I wanted to learn more, I desired more, and I suppose I shouldn't gripe too much but I wanted more with that. This movie is good, but if it didn't have the performances of Downey Jr. and Foxx, I truly believe this would be above average at best.Performances. Jamie Foxx is one of the best working actors in Hollywood today, and he can chalk up another brilliant performance here. His ticks that he had, the little nervous rambles, the way he looked it was just amazing. My only complaint was I felt a little cold by his character sometimes. Robert Downey Jr. is great here. His suave characteristics and his charisma are hard to match these days, and once again gave an engaging show.Bottom line. The Soloist was a good, but underwhelming film in my opinion. It tries so hard to be Oscar worthy, that I think it tried too hard at times. It's well worth a viewing, but don't expect an Oscar worthy show.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Mostly hits the right notes,"Most of us know that The Soloist is a true story about a Julliard dropout, Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx), who plays two strings of a violin on the streets of LA until LA Times reporter Steve Lopez (Robert Downey, Jr.) writes about him in columns and eventually a book, ""The Soloist: A Lost Dream, and Unlikely Friendship, and the Redemptive Power of Music."" And Ayers is no easy subject.But the story is as much about friendship as celebrity, as much about remaining true to your ideals as rising out of poverty, and as much about schizophrenia as pride.The Soloist gives ample opportunity for two actors with serious chops to exercise their gifts more than it gives us any insight into Ayers' illness or Lopez's talent. Although billed second, Downey is the concertmaster.Additionally, it reveals the considerable homeless population of LA as worthy of attention: some 90,000 souls depicted alternately celebrating their companionship and dodging the LA police enforcing a no-stealing-grocery-carts policy. While even this meticulously presented story can only hope to capture the grimness of homeless street homes, Atonement director Joe Wright shows again how adept he can be at filming groups of the suffering unfortunate.As in State of Play, The Soloist makes some reference to the plight of print newspapers, which themselves face homelessness in the wake of the Internet juggernaut. I wish someone would explore this growingly-intense topic more fully because most print writers want to face the printless future armed for survival, and the rest of us who live by morning coffee and newspapers share a kinship with those writers. Because I have now climbed onto my Hyde-Park soapbox, I will offer my advice that the Academy award Robert Downey, Jr. an actual Oscar rather than nominations. As I see his graying head in Soloist, I worry that someday I'll see him receive the Academy's lifetime achievement award without a legitimate statuette. I prefer he be not a soloist but rather a peer of the likes of Phillip Seymour Hoffman.I have now stepped down from my box. You're welcome.",,Anonymous,Music
A Powerful Story That Can't Quite Come Together,"The Soloist tells the true story of L.A. Times reporter Steve Lopez (Robert Downey Jr.) discovering Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx) a cello prodigy whose mental illness has pushed him into homelessness. It is a heartwarming story of perseverance and a reminder that amazing people can be found in the most unexpected places. It is also a portrayal of mental illness, particularly schizophrenia, and the struggle it can create, both for those suffering from it and those who care about them.Unfortunately, those two impactful themes are not blended together well and the transition between them feels harsh and undermines their impact. There is also a focus on the homelessness problem, but it is not fleshed out well and doesn't have the impact it could. They also added the fictional subplot of Lopez having gone through a recent divorce, but still working with and being close with his ex- wife (Catherine Keener). This really doesn't add much to the story past giving a reason that Lopez throws himself so much into trying to help Nathaniel.The problems ultimately boil down to underwhelming direction from Joe Wright, which is disappointing given his excellent work on ""Atonement"" and ""Pride and Prejudice."" All the right pieces were there to make The Soloist a powerful and moving film, but it can't quite come together as a single piece.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

"Homelessness, mental illness and classical music","The Soloist was clearly an Oscar bait film, a film based on a book and a true story, has the issues of classical music, homelessness and mental issues, stars two very respected actors, set in Los Angeles and directed by a director with a growing reputation. But it did not pan out that way for the filmmakers.Steve Lopez (Robert Downey Jr.) is a columnist for the Los Angeles Times looking for a story. By a chance encounter Steve meets Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx), a homeless man but a gifted musician despite only having a two string violin. Steve investigates and finds out Nathaniel had dropped out of Juilliard. It is obvious that Nathaniel is suffering mental illness and Steve sets out to help the man whilst writing about him for the newspaper. Steve's columns start to pull the heartstrings of the city and bring the issues of homelessness and the LAMP Community Center to the attention of the city's authorities. But as Steve gets closer to Nathaniel it is clear that Nathaniel is unstable.The Soloist best feature is the acting and Downey and Foxx have excellent chemistry. Foxx does the best job, making Nathaniel having a calm but erratic speech pattern. He is a man who looks deep inside and does not really want to face the world: Steve is the only person who makes him. Foxx also has to show when Nathaniel turns and being more aggressive. Downey is of course a gifted actor and you can believe in the friendship between the two men, but I do not like the way his character was written to be a bit of a klutz. It's not Downey's fault but it was like they wanted a cheap laugh.Joe Wright is of course a director with a future and as I write this I am personally looking forward to his next film Hanna. The Soloist is obviously an attempt for Wright to step away from his confront zone, period English drama. He does attempt to make The Soloist more visual, with tracking shots (but you really do not want a tracking shot over a load of toilet cubicles. But many of these visual tricks felt a bit forces, almost like look at me, whether it was looking at a papier-mâché globe with a hurricane and it turns into TV footage of Hurricane Karina or when Nathaniel is in a concert hall and he can see the music. I personally preferred the more grounded stuff set in the Los Angeles inner-city, showing how homeless people are suffering from their addictions. They stuff had a bit more bite to it. I do like some of the references to Amadeus, with the young version of Nathaniel practicing the cello with his arm and you could hear the music in his head. There is also great classic music as you would expect from a film like this.One of the major issues is homelessness in America. In America it is clear that quite a lot of homeless people have mental health issues and since state and federal does not do anything to help them. In Europe or anywhere else in the industrialised world people like that would be put into care and given the treatment they need. The America healthcare system was a real joke, where you only got decent care if you could afford it, not based on need, a system that only profits insurance and pharmaceutical companies is put ahead of the care of the parent: a system fully supported by the Republican party! Rant over.Within the film there is flashbacks about Nathaniel showing he was a child prodigy and his time in Juilliard as he descents into madness. To me that would have been a very dark and interesting film about how he became homeless and his only outlet was classical music. But that's just me.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Wonderful,"I LOVED this. I remembered seeing a documentary about the homeless and the Lamp community in LA, and the cello player having been featured in real life. In the docu there weren't nearly as many homeless mashing around in so threatening a manner, and I envied the life of the cellist. 
I wondered how soon after the docu was made (or before?) did the journalist come along? 
Great performance by Downey, depicting compassion for those perceived as less fortunate while misunderstanding their real need. The case worker (Nielsan Ellis in this movie) seemed to get it right.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
All the stars are for pretty much for Jamie Foxx,"I found it hard to rate this film. I wanted to like it. And Jamie Foxx deserves a higher rating for his performance.
The main reason to see it is Jamie Foxx's performance and I suspect the portrayal of auditory hallucinations is quite authentic (I work in Mental Health).
I was jolted out of the film by both Robert Downey Jr. and his character at several points. His character was not engaging and didn't feel well acted to me. Surely a journalist has to be intelligent (intellectually and emotionally) and possess some degree of empathy. His selfish motivations, saviour-complex, lack of empathy, foresight, total absence of common sense and consideration were jarring to me. His (partial) realisation and ""soul-searching"" at the end do nothing for me.
There were two scenes which I strongly hated. The pathetic scenes of near-slapstick - both involving urine. They are completely out of place. The worst is the supposedly intelligent character juggling a bag of urine whilst managing to unconvincingly ""accidentally"" (but wholly predictably) spill it on himself. I have absolutely no idea why they were there - they did not give anything to the story, they did not fit at all in the film, they were ridiculous, badly acted and not at all amusing. WHY?
If one could somehow erase the slapstick urine scenes and tweak (or better still replace) Robert Downey Jr's performance/character it could be much better.
If I were scoring Jamie Foxx or the portrayal (via audio effects) of schizophrenia I would score at least an 8/10.

Great acting marred by hapless direction,"""The Soloist"" is the reel adaptation of the real life story of LA Times journalist Steve Lopez (played by Robert Downey Jr) And Nathaniel Ayers (played by Jamie Foxx).Directed by Joe Wright (""Pride and Prejudice"" and ""Atonement""), there was huge expectations from this movie. But disappointingly, this movie seems very disoriented and stretched too long for comfort. The end result is what was supposed to be an inspiring movie about friendship, faith, music turns out to be a boring, self-obsessed, confused venture for Joe Wright.Cast wise, one can't expect more. Both lead actors were just too good for their respective role. Special mention for Robert Downey Jr, who was born to play this character. His dialogue-delivery, trademark facial expression, emotions were just pitch-perfect. Jamie Foxx did a good job also, but I personally feel Robert Downey Jr was the heartbeat of this entire movie.The biggest drawback of this movie was its length. It's okay to make ~2 hours movie, but to stretch it unnecessarily is not worthwhile. The final editing was much disoriented. Even after such a great performance from the lead, one never feels connected and attached towards the story or the characters.Overall, ""The Soloist"" was not what everyone expected it to be. This project was just not suited for Joe Wright, who seems to have mastered making period movies. It's a pity that talents of Robert Downey Jr and Jamie Foxx were not able to compensate for Wright's bad direction.My Verdict: 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Music
What a sleeper!,"Where has this film been hiding. Not just another look at what mental illness does to a person.

Decent film hampered by a lack of focus and tonal confusion,"I went in not knowing what to expect, and what I got was mediocre. The big thing for me is that the movie sometimes couldn't decide what it wanted to be. I mean, you'd have moments of slapstick juxtaposed with moments that were obviously trying to be genuinely emotional. And for me, the only emotional parts were the instrumental sections. Outside of that, I don't think the movie really found any focus, which I see as it's biggest problem. Also, many moments which could have been serious were ruined by unintentional humor on the part of Jamie Foxx's characterization. Other than that, it wasn't too bad of a movie, but not one that I would really want to see again.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Hard to watch because honest,"As a Los Angeleno who has spent years stepping around tents and sleeping bags, I found the portrayals of homelessness here almost documentary-like in their accuracy. And it is to the film's credit that it makes no attempt to create a Cinderella story out of the ever-tragic (real) tale of a man with schizophrenia. Downey and Foxx are predictably excellent (either one is pretty much a recommendation for a film all by himself). It's also good that the film portrays, almost in filigree, the decline of print media and the difficulties very familiar to many of us locally faced by journalists in our newspapers. This said, the very honesty of the film makes it hard to watch and in fact much like a documentary. There are many reasons to watch, and even admire, it. But only select viewers will want to spend their time in this world.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
beautiful performances highlight this true story,"""The Soloist"" from 2009 is based on a true story and stars Robert Downey Jr. and Jamie Foxx.An LA Times columnist, Steve Lopez (Downey), is in need of a story in 2005, shortly after smashing his face up in a bicycle accident. One day he discovers Nathaniel Ayers (Foxx), a homeless man who plays the violin. Steve decides he would make a good story.As he writes his articles, Lopez learns more about Ayers. He has a sister who loves him (LisaGay Hamilton) and is concerned about him; his original instrument was the cello.The stories bring all kinds of attention to the problem of homelessness, to Lopez himself, and to the gifted Ayers, and a cello is actually donated to him. He loves to play his music in the tunnels, doesn't like to be inside, and idolizes Beethoven. In flashbacks, we see bits of his life which appear to be a loving mother and no father, and we see a truck on fire, which was part of his trauma.Nathaniel's plight does a lot for Steve Lopez, and though he is someone who shies away from commitment, he wants to help him. But in reaching out, he experiences the hurt and pain that often comes from dealing with the mentally ill, in this case, schizophrenia.The film asks a few questions: can a person who refuses medication be forced to take it; does every homeless person want to be in a home; and why in such a rich country do we have so many homeless (90,000 in Los Angeles as of 2009).Lopez works to understand the talented Nathaniel, and Nathaniel begins to see him as a true friend. Both are needy people and not particularly trusting. But true freedom comes in facing one's demons.Wonderful film about courage and understanding.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Bad screenplay even worst directing...put you to sleep in 10 minutes,"I thought this would be a touching movie like ""A beautiful Mind"" instead I wanted to delete it from my DVR after 5 minutes into the movie.

After 20 minutes I regretted I have wasted 20 minutes of my precious time staring at my TV waiting for it to get better. The boy who plays the young Nathaniel was absolutely awful. His fingers did not even match the rhythm of the music he was playing at audtion. Overall, this is such a poorly written and directed movie. A waste of time. Fortunately I watched it on cable for free. If this was a DVD rental from Blockbuster that would have been a waste of my money and my time.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
More the cello than the violins,"It was a rainy day and a good day to go to a movie. I'm not a fan of the action ""franchises"". I prefer what I call ""people"" movies- movies that are about human beings, their lives and relationships. I'm willing to check them out whether or not they got great reviews or won awards, (which they often do because they stand out so much against the video-game dreck). ""The Soloist"" has gotten some very negative reviews from some sources but I decided to give it a shot. It turned out to be one of the best movies I've seen in years.The key to it is that it doesn't try to be sentimental. There is a cello but not much violin music and that seems symbolic of the approach: it tells the story and presents the characters without sentimentality or lectures. The film allows us to determine our own reaction to it. Robert Downey Jr. gives his best ever performance as Mr. Lopez, the reporter who starts out looking at Mr. Ayers as a way to fill a column but comes to realize he was exploiting him rather than trying to be his friend. He then realizes that to be his friend he has to accept him as he is rather than forcing him to someone else. Jamie Foxx, who is amazing in the way he loses himself in his roles, avoids overplaying his part or asking for sympathy. He just acted what he saw. Together they are the best movie acting tandem I've seen in a long time.The film is brilliantly made, with just a hint of what Mr. Ayers has gone through trying to sort out reality and imagination and his triumph over the tragedy by finding a way to keep playing his music even if he was unable to continue his formal career. The editing is wonderful, jumping back and forth between Ayers and Lopez's stories without ever being confusing.I couldn't help but compare this to ""A Beautiful Mind"", which also deals with schizophrenia but is full of inaccuracies. That was a good film despite that but this is a much better one.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Contrived,"""The Soloist"" proves once again that it's never a good sign when a movie suddenly gets pulled from the Oscar schedule. At the time Paramount said it had something to do with some new scheduling campaign. The truth comes out this weekend though and the final verdict is that it doesn't bode well for the Oscar chances of its two very talented leads or the movie itself this year either. The movie is based on a book by Steve Lopez about schizophrenic cellist Nathaniel Ayers Jr. I haven't read the book or watched any of the various news stories about the relationship between the two because I was hoping that the movie would capture whatever incredible true story happened here and I wanted to be surprised. Just unfortunately the screenplay by Susannah Grant (a talented dramatic writer responsible for ""Erin Brockovich"" and ""In her Shoes"") feels less like ""Shine"" and more like blah.Robert Downey Jr. plays Steve Lopez, a reporter for the Los Angeles Times who while eating lunch notices a homeless man with nothing but a shopping cart full of crap and a violin with only two strings. He's playing it right in front of a statue of his hero, Beethoven. The man is Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx), who began as a young cello player. As a young boy his life became all about music, shutting out the world around him for the sweet sounds of Beethoven and his own dreams of becoming his equal. He attended Julliard School with hopes of becoming the best but instead he suffered a mental breakdown that sent him falling from grace and into playing music under bridges and on street corners. Lopez finds the story fascinating and writes a human-interest piece about him and soon he's trying to help Nathaniel get back on a right track again. But does Nathaniel even want to do that? Grant's screenplay likes to pat itself on the back for showing that a friendship such as this can exist. It's all very formulaic and slightly questionable. Is Lopez staying with Nathaniel out of care or because it would make for good continuing articles if Nathaniel becomes a success? Lopez, who's developed only up to the point of being an accident-prone divorcée, managed some notoriety out of this so it does smack of exploitation but I also have to imagine that the book and various stories on this subject did have more context to it, especially when it comes to the Los Angeles homeless, mental illness, and the subject of Ayer's redemption. The movie's best scenes show the despair of the Lamp Homeless shelter, the drug use and mental illness that plague society's cast-offs. These scenes are good because the people seem real, but once it switches back to Lopez and Ayers, its all phony uplift that doesn't really say much. It's crap, but it tries to trick you with beauty. During musical interludes, director Joe Wright follows seagulls as they soar through the air with the music and in the most blinding moment of the year so far, he stages a light show that's supposed to represent how Nathaniel sees the music in his head.Both actors do their best. Foxx is very good here, finding the humanity that the screenplay doesn't. He's a hurried, agitated rambler, a man with a natural love for music, and a tragic genius cut down by his own brain. He brings both a free spirit and pained sense of claustrophobic entrapment by his illness, and one thing he and Joe Wright do very well is displaying schizophrenia as a haunting illness if nothing else. Downey has less to do but he manages to be as cynical and funny as always. Catherine Keener is also in this movie, playing Lopez's ex-wife, but she's very much underused.""The Soloist"" is the second movie in two weeks, after ""State of Play"", to also bring up the fact that young people don't seem to be reading newspapers anymore. Human interest stories like this one are pretty solid ways to generate interest though and I'm sure at the time the articles were being written there was way more to the story of Steve and Nathaniel than this very Hollywood-ized treatment would have you believe.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Foxx is amazing  in an okay movie,"Jamie Foxx is Oscar worthy in this, simply amazing, was he nominated? The movie itself is good/okay. It follows Steve Lopez, a down on his luck (and hurting) Los Angeles Times journalist who, while looking for a new article to write about for the paper befriends a homeless Juilliard-trained musician. Foxx plays the schizophrenic former violin prodigy and balances well with Downey.Some moments did feel long winded as we (I guess) enter Nathaniel Ayers' mind and listen to the voices and music with him. I was never much impressed with the music here. Downey is...Downey. Good and kinda cocky as per.The scenes with all the homeless people at the shelter was like something from another world and very impressive. I also appreciated that we are allowed to see the violent side of schizophrenia, Steve Lopez didn't just ""fix"" Ayers for a Hollywood HEA. 06/13",7.0,Anonymous,Music

The Soloist a good time not to see it,"When you pick a movie I hope one factor you will consider, are the actors in the movie using their fame to influence the moral fabric of our society in a positive or negative way? This is not a political statement this is a moral issue that effects are society. When a comedian/actor makes curl sexual and racist remarks about a teenager and her father we should ask ourselves (do I want to support that behavior)? In this case Mr. Foxx behavior tears at the social fabric that teaches our youth right from wrong, good behavior from bad that loving-kindness is better than hatefulness. Mr. Foxx should remember he is only entertainment and there is a lot of that out there for us to choose from. Saying sorry does not get him off the hook. It will not undue the hurt or remove the bad behavior he spreads to our youth. One way to stop this behavior is to stop being a fan of it. No longer see anything they are part of.

A very good drama that'll be sourly overlooked,"Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to see this in theaters because it was in and out very quickly. I finally got a chance to see this, a couple of nights ago and I was thoroughly impressed. Jamie Foxx (who plays Nathaniel Ayers) and Robert Downey Jr. (who plays Steve Lopez) are not my favorite actors, but both fit their roles very well. They have excellent chemistry, and I deeply care for their characters.I also enjoyed how the film depicted schizophrenia. It isn't shown, as something the character understands like with Russell Crowe's character in ""A Beautiful Mind"", but rather a dark, mysterious presence that drives Nathaniel into violent mood swings and actions. It's hard to depict in film on what's going on in someone's mind, but the randomness and unpredictability of Nathaniel makes it unique. Though the movie's focus is on Nathaniel, our sympathy lies on Steve, as he at first sees Nathaniel as a source for helping his career, but later ends up caring for him as a friend. He has his limits and at times loses it, but it is something we can relate to, trying to aid someone in whom you don't know how to help and then lose patience due to that.Aiding in the performances is some very beautiful cinematography by Seamus McGarvey (who helped Joe Wright with ""Atonement""). His choice of colors, lighting, and camera angles add a dark and abstract feeling to the film, which reflects the mind of Nathaniel. The film also has beautiful/authentic looking sets and crisp clean editing and Dario Marianelli's choice of music is mainly pieces of classical music, but like the cinematography, it reflects the mood and emotions of Nathaniel as well as the story.We've seen this plot many times, as of the likes in ""Rain Man"" and ""A Beautiful Mind"", in which the Oscars love to bait, but ""The Soloist"" is unique and different. It isn't syrupy or over-dramatic. It is a rock solid drama that is both enjoyable to watch and grabs your emotions. It also sheds light on one of this country's biggest problems, the injustice of the homeless. And I'm disappointed that this film hasn't received any golden globe noms and it will be unlikely to be nominated for something for the 2010 Oscars.Though I enjoy this movie, the film ended too quickly and I felt it could have explained more about Nathaniel's condition. Yes, I love the technical aspects on how it reflects his mood with the cinematography and music, but it needed more plot to explain how he got it and how it affected his family. We know how it has affected him, but it doesn't show a whole lot of the damage it has caused the people around him, which have forced him to live on the streets of L.A.Despite this small gap in the story, I consider ""The Soloist"" as one of this year's best films. I haven't seen too many spectacular ones this year, but this one is very good.***1/2 out of ****",9.0,Anonymous,Music

But as he begins to unearth the mystery of how this alternately brilliant and distracted street musician, once a dynamic prodigy headed for fame, wound up living in tunnels and doorways, it sparks an unexpected quest. Imagining he can change Ayers' life, Lopez embarks on a quixotic mission to get him off the streets and back to the world of music.But even as he fights to save Ayers' life, he begins to see that it is Ayers—with his unsinkable passion, his freedom-loving obstinacy and his valiant attempts at connection and love—who is profoundly changing Lopez.Evren Buyruk from USA",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"A Lot of Questions, but Few Answers","THE SOLOIST is a difficult film to review. First, the subject matter: a newspaper writer of a human interest column for the LA Times, with personal problems of his own, encounters a schizophrenic homeless man who spends his days playing classical music on a two string violin and provides fodder for a new human interest column - an accidental encounter that develops into a friendship and challenge and some semblance of change in the personalities of both men. Second, the cast: performances by Jamie Foxx as the gifted homeless Julliard trained cellist Nathaniel Ayers and Robert Downey, Jr. as the troubled and frustrated but kind hearted writer Steve Lopez turn in very fine and credible performances. Third, the message: calling attention to the plight of the homeless and their need for simple acts of kindness is well portrayed. Fourth, the music that serves as a character in the film: the cello solos are played with grace and style by LA Phil cellist Ben Hong and the LA Philharmonic as conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen and present in the background and on the screen with in the grandeur of Disney Hall create as solid a film score as possible. Fifth, the supporting cast: with Catherine Keener in a thankless role as Lopez' boss and ex-wife, Marcos De Silvas as LA Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and Tom Hollander as a cello instructor make the best of the poorly developed roles they are given.So what goes wrong here? For this viewer the problems lie with the screenplay by Susannah Grant, an acceptable adaptation of Steve Lopez' novel, but so loaded with LA Times promo and info and mawkish sentimentality that the story all but drowns. Director Joe Wright seems to take the stance of letting the story flow on its own, the only relief being the use of flashbacks that attempt to explain the mental and physical state of Nathaniel Ayers. This is a film that longs to be loved, but in the end it is only a passable human interest story.Grady Harp",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Steve Lopez And The Real Man,"If there were ever any doubt that Robert Downey Jr. is one of our best current actors out there, then this film should put them to rest. Still having doubts? Check out his more current resume: KISS KISS BANG BANG, GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK, IRON MAN, and his amazing TROPIC THUNDER. And these are just a select few that I've cherry picked. This isn't to say that Jamie Foxx (DREAMGIRLS) didn't do a great job. It's just that Downey Jr. is showing up in some awfully great roles and performing them to perfection, as witnessed here in THE SOLOIST.This is a story close to my heart. Similar in theme to LARS AND THE REAL GIRL, this story doesn't circle around a town coming together to help one man's psyche. This story is about two men who orbit in entirely different galaxies and how a passing swipe ends up creating a lifetime friendship. Yes, there's the mental illness aspect to it and Foxx plays the role of Nathaniel Ayers exceptionally well. His schizophrenia is obvious, and living on the streets hasn't helped. And when newspaper reporter Steve Lopez (Downey Jr.) tries finding a story to write about, he stumbles upon Nathaniel's past as a Juilliard Music School drop-out. Nathaniel plays a violin with only two strings, and as Steve Lopez writes about his newfound friend in the paper, a donation comes floating in: a beautiful cello.This cello has multiple draws for Nathaniel, and some of them aren't good. The positives are that Nathaniel can play a beautiful instrument beautifully. And that he finally starts forming a friendly tie with someone (anyone!) It just happens to be Steve Lopez. Steve starts showing him around the current musical scene. But with Nathaniel's reawakening comes the remembrance of his past and how he got to where he is. His mental breakdown comes crashing back into current memory, even as Steve, his new friend, tries to help him out more and more.The side-story of Steve and his wife's reconciliation (Catherine Keener, AN American CRIME) is pretty much fluff for the movie/story and doesn't add much. It is the touching and powerful story of a friendship forming amidst a respect for one another, a love of music, and facing the challenges of an oft-times debilitating mental illness that drives this wonderful film.And the music ain't too shabby either.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Although I am a scientist, music has always been a part of my life. It has given me joy, comfort, power and peace when I was in the ups and (especially) downs in my life. I understand how powerful music can be.This movie is about how music can save a person when he is in the deepest hole you can imagine in life. Jamie Foxx is marvelous in this movie. I've never really liked him before I watched this movie. His music background certainly helped. My only small complaint is that when he is playing with the orchestra, you actually can tell he is not really playing. His arm motion and body expression is certainly out of place when compared with other cello players. But when he is playing violin or cello by himself, it is very believable. You would think it is really him playing what you hear from the soundtrack.The biggest lesson I learned from this movie: every homeless people has his/her own story. You will feel compassion and sympathy if you actually take the time to listen to their story.Bravo!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Rain Man-esque? Forest Gumpian? I Am Sam-ish? And Not in a Good Way,"Just what movies don't need in my opinion: yet another take on Rain Man or Forest Gump or whatever. Why would anyone want to listen to the dialogue of people who make no sense? I'm really not interested in a protagonist who plays handball with his own poop. If it's music I'm after I'll go to the concert hall.Attempting to portray mental illness cinematically is about as stupid and pointless as doing the same with a LSD trip: it's been done many, many times before and they have all failed. Trying to visualize music is an equally pointless task unless you're out to make rock videos: the lowest rung on the ladder of art.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

"Oscar worthy, yet no nominations?","Why was Jamie Foxx not nominated for an Oscar in this? He was brilliant and the story couldn't be more relevant and important. Unfortunately, it barely made back half of its production budget, so I guess that killed any chance of awards. Sad. Good films go unappreciated. Idiot superhero movies make all the money.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
What happened??,"The Soloist is a beautifully crafted film.Robert Downey, Jr. is, as always, wonderful as LA Times columnist Steve Lopez. There is something about his own well worn face and expressive eyes that imbues his portrayal with a truth that another actor would not have been able to bring. The script does not gloss over Lopez's flaws and turn him into a refugee from a TV Movie of the Week, and all of those flaws are visible thanks to RDJ's performance.Jamie Foxx, in my humble opinion, proves that ""Ray"" was not a fluke of casting. Even more than his nearly note-perfect portrayal of Ray Charles, his Nathaniel Ayers, Jr. says this man is a truly multi-faceted actor. (Frankly I hope more people see The Soloist and reach that conclusion. It might help his next scheduled release ""Law Abiding Citizen."")I think in the hands of director without the deft touch of Joe Wright, this could have been heavy handed, treacly, feel-good pap. Despite the fact that this is a true story, the audience is allowed to go on Lopez's journey with him. Nobody's holding up flashcards and telling the viewer what to feel next.Here's what I want to know: What the h*ll happened to this film's marketing campaign? (or should I say the lack thereof). It was pushed back twice and finally released in April of this year w/almost no press and was quickly forgotten. That usually means it's crap. In fact, it sends the message that it's crap. I've heard rumblings that the scheduled release last fall (which would have put it in awards contention)was nixed because of the country's economic downturn, and who wants to see a movie about homeless people? Are we really that fragile? This movie deserves to be in awards contention,probably at least as much, if not more than some that were.The argument could be made that with the expansion of the Best Picture category to ten slots that it has a better chance this year. The April release date, however, is probably still a handicap. And it would be a damn shame if this were overlooked. Foxx, Downey,Jr. and Wright all deserve consideration.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Fascinating Real Life Study,"Interesting based on fact film directed by dyslexic British filmmaker Joe Wright. Wright seems like an odd choice for this film considering his success with high caliber romantic and literary movies like ""Pride and Prejudice"" '05 ~ ""Atonement"" 07 ~ and ""Anna Karenina"" '012. Perhaps, the at times uneven style of ""The Soloist"" harks back to Wright's earlier days as a Video clip director but might also be partly due to Susannah Grant's screenplay. Somewhere between the two, this production has a couple of seemingly disjointed scenes that to some, could seem misplaced.The story is a powerful one, with Jammie Foxx perfectly cast playing the mentally afflicted and volatile Cello prodigy Nathaniel Ayers. Ayers, while living on the mean streets of Los Angeles playing broken down instruments, attracts the interest of L.A. Times columnist Steve Lopez - Robert Downey Jr delivers one of his more sincere performances as Lopez. Foxx, who has been known for having some difficulty working with cast members on other projects, works hard at this difficult role and impresses.Italian composer Dario Marianelli is at home with his work on several Beethoven and Bach classics and Irish director of photography Seamus McGarvey (The Hours '02) together with his director delivers a mix of pop art and dramatic images.This is thoughtful film making that offers many inspirational moments - it's strength lies in it's fact based and tormented subject. Recommended viewing and definitely one that has much to offer a wider audience - as well as its insight into the care of the mentally unstable and the impact they bring to family and friends.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
The music must go on...,"'The Soloist' is one of those movies that pieces you together. I came across this title on reading Robert Downey Jr's biography. This is one of his most sincere portrayals.This is based on a book written by Steve Lopez. Downey plays Steve Lopez. The chemistry between Downey & Foxx is mystical. Both come together in the most unusual way.The movie explores one of the most debated topic; does a mentally ill person need medications to get better, is love and emotional support not way more powerful? Both characters feed off each other's friendship, making each a better person.The film puts forth a pertinent question; how many other Nathaniel Ayers lurk around, clueless and lost? Life is unpredictable. We may never truly know the answer to this question. However this movie is all about a gem found after being hidden for ever so long. This is by no means a fairy tale movie. Ayers does not get better in a jiffy. However his find, road to recovery & his attempt to refit into the society, not just helps him but Lopez too.Worth a watch.

"A bit of a downer, but then there is Downey! Hooray!","I will not isolate the ""The Soloist"" as the supreme film of 2009; but I do think it does harmonize itself into a profound film on friendship, homelessness, and schizophrenia. ""The Soloist"" is based on a true story of a Los Angeles Times journalist Steve Lopez who befriends homeless musician Nathaniel Ayers in the city of angels. To this day, they still remain close and because of mutual respect they call each other by Mister. And I will do the same; I will refer to them as Mr. throughout my review. And also, the 80's band Mr. Mister will provide the soundtrack of my ""The Soloist"" film review! Kidding! Come back! Don't do a solo on me! I will bring you back to the story! Mr. Lopez met Mr. Ayers in 2005 in one of Mr. Lopez's solo journalistic city escapades in trying to figure his next story for the paper. Mr. Lopez saw Mr. Ayers with his homeless attire and shopping kart playing a mean violin. Then Mr. Lopez's writing light bulbs sparkled and before you know it: Viola! ""Homeless Violin Player"" came to the Mr. Lopez cerebral cortex as an idea for his next story. Mr. Lopez did investigate Mr. Ayer's background and learned that Mr. Ayers was a musically gifted Julliard student in the early 70's who majored in Celloism, sort of speak. He also learned that Mr. Ayers ended up dropping out of Julliard because of his schizophrenia condition. Mr. Lopez initially does have soloist ulterior motives in his friendship with Mr. Ayers, but then genuine emotions towards Mr. Ayers do get the better of Mr. Lopez as he grows closer to Mr. Ayers. OK, I think I am putting a little bit too much ""misterd"" on this hot dog review of ""The Soloist"", so I will give the Mister thing a rest! Director Joe Wright does an admirable effort in displaying the atrocities of homeless life in urban Los Angeles, and how the power of friendship can be the homeless' biggest ally to get out of the mental gutter. But Wright's left hand woman in ""The Soloist"" Writer Susannah Grant did not give the Wright word to back him up. Her discomforting, uneven screenplay of ""The Soloist"" was a bit off-key. Robert Downey Jr. does not let us down once more with his startling performance as Lopez. Jamie Foxx's thespian symphony was a tragic but weighty one in his heartbreaking portrayal of Ayers; his schizophrenic self-mumbles were quite remarkable. But my Oscar bets are more down with Downey Jr. for the solo Best Actor nomination from the film. The last act of my film review concerto of ""The Soloist"" orchestrates in summary that this film should not be left alone, and needs your movie-goer company. If for no better reason, 2 and a ½ words—Robert Downey Jr.!!!!!!!!!! **** Good",8.0,Anonymous,Music
The Artistic Values of this Movie Goes Beyond What's Expected,"The beauty of ""The Soloist"" is gloriously flabbergasting. The music will have you in stitches. The creativity in the making of this movie will inspire you to pick up an instrument and join in because the music is so sublime. But throughout, the message carries with you the whole way through and it's artistic values never shy away from the theme of the movie. The movie is not a family oriented movie, primarily due to the strong subject matter centred around a homeless man with a mental setback and the lack of service the state of California can do to provide this important cause. This at times can even be aggravating to even the mature audiences, but the story is capable to educate you on this subject and also to be entertained by the audiences.For those who have family members with mental illnesses can easily relate to the character of Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx in an amazing performance), in the difficult struggles they face in life and towards the family members who are handling the situations they face. And those who have never encountered a person in the condition Nathaniel faces everyday in life will be able to understand that even though he's ill, doesn't mean he's not able to amount to anything. Even though Foxx and Robert Downey Jr. turned in some excellent performances, they are backed up with a strong supporting cast which also provide equally amazing performances.The cellist who was tutoring Foxx's character comes off as unlikable, but the actor who played the character banked a convincing performance. The character was in serious desire for a reality check it's not funny. One of the most memorable scenes was when the musician tutor calls journalist Steve Lopez (Downey) to set up Nathan for a performance. While the phone call is in progress, he is in an awkward position that keeps himself isolated and incoherent in the world that surrounds him, making this guy an arrogant and ignorant character. But this character in particular may symbolize the ignorance of society in general and how lackadaisical we are for people like Nathan's character.Like one would expect, lot of ground has been covered that it can leave one very sad after the credits roll. Not from the high-profiled storyline, but more from our own self-centred agendas leaving out those who are in need for our help only to be neglected by us.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A wonderful movie about our common humanity,"Summary (Nutshell)""The Soloist"" sets out to be the quest of an LA Times journalist Steve Lopez searching for interesting story. Not content with choosing from the plethora of mundane topics, he starts looking for the everyday person, worth writing about. He discovers a homeless man, playing his two-string violin under a statue of Beethoven, in the middle of Los Angeles. This brief encounter quickly develops into a more intricate relationship. Lopez finds himself sympathetic to help the homeless Mr. Ayers. Suffering from schizophrenic delusions, Ayers can only express himself through one of his many instruments, preferably the Cello. Lopez embarks on a mission to reintegrate Ayers into society, by facilitating his love for classical music; this proofs more difficult than he thought.Comment:As a fellow musician, I've found myself very compassionate with Ayers' love for Beethoven. When you close your eyes, the music floods your mind, dozens of instruments play at the same time, but instead of suffering from sensory overload, you form a unit with the symphony, resonating with every note, feeling the composer's love, anger and passion. By playing the piece, we are able to reconstruct and reunite with an indescribable beauty, so simple in nature, yet which will never fade, even when the meaning of words left us long ago. Ayers' offers a glimpse into a highly talented musician, who is confined by his social status and medical condition, but yet someone who is able to enchant his listeners when he plays.Robert Downey Jr.'s and Jamie Foxx's performance was absolutely stellar. Jamie Foxx is an unbelievable actor, his performance in Ray was already phenomenal, but I believe he has outdone himself as Ayers. He seems to be able to understand the musical mind and can portray the forces that drive/restrict it. I highly recommend watching this music.Our endless struggle for self-fulfillment is a struggle, we have to fight for ourselves. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Oscar glory might have passed by ""The Soloist,"" but no one else should","It was about a year ago that ""The Soloist"" was an early Oscar prediction. With a proved commodity like Jamie Foxx in a role eerily similar to his Oscar-winning turn as Ray Charles and 2008 star reborn in Robert Downey Jr. as the co-pilot, this based on a true story about a journalist and a homeless musician forging a difficult relationship seemed primed for gold. Then, much like Foxx's character Nathaniel Ayers Jr. did, ""The Soloist"" fell from grace. Eyeing what would be a competitive awards season, Dreamworks/Universal decided to wave the white flag and push the film to April and litter Oscar season with early TV promos. A wise move? Perhaps. The hype might no longer be there, but if it had stayed, it would have been worthy.The stars certainly carry this film. Foxx might seem like he's re-channeling ""Ray"" in the previews, but this character is and feels so different for him. Yet again he is transformative as a schizophrenic with a passion for music. Anyone has spent time talking with or who works with people with mental illness can attest that this is what it's like. There is a humble realism in his performance and in the choice to use actual homeless in the film. Downey Jr. also impresses with his ability to make Steve Lopez his without injecting too much of his own style: It helps keep this character separate from his others and is important in a film based on truth.Most underrated in this film is the work of director Joe Wright (""Atonement""). Always a fan of lengthy shots and sweeping camera movement, Wright makes sure ""The Soloist"" reflect the appreciation for art that lies at the heart of his film and the book and news columns it was based off. He has a talent for setting a mood with his camera-work and can so easily heighten the drama or tone things back when the film becomes more about the music. The scene where we see splashes of colored lights to the music with the intent of putting us in Ayers' perspective might seem boring but it's brilliant. Wright makes the most of this script and does some beautiful editing to make it feel seamless. He's sure to direct a masterpiece in the future: ""The Soloist"" is a bit too gritty and real to completely take off under his direction despite his fantastic work with it.The one weakness that would have kept ""The Soloist"" from Academy recognition had it stayed in the running was the fact that the script often suffered from the same condition as its focal character: schizophrenia. It takes quite a bit of time for ""The Soloist"" to decide what it's about, but it comes together very nicely. It's a film about their relationship, but then there are moments of Lopez's personal life and flashbacks of Ayers' life before he became ill. Susannah Grant (""Erin Brockovich"") does a nice job making all these important elements work, at least in certain portions of the film. Others parts, namely toward the middle, lag a bit, but considering what Wright and the talented actors, including the always lovable Catherine Keener as Lopez's ex, manage to do with it, it was quite well done.~Steven CVisit my site moviemusereviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"A Sharp, Melodic Story of Mental Illness","12 June 2009. This movie bursts with music and creative photographic snapshots while provided suggestive reflections from 2001: A SPACE ODDYSEY (1968) and even KOYANNISQATSI (1983). This adult version of AUGUST RUSH (2007), brings to the screen a strong relational movie about mental illness and musical brilliance. More importantly, this movie avoids any necessity for the use of the major twist that A BEAUTIFUL MIND (2001) and instead allow the focus to be strictly on the cinematic presentation of mental illness, to even greater affect. There are a few minor weaknesses where Robert Downey Jr.'s own on-screen persona almost overtakes his character even though its played down quite a bit, there is a slow paced section a little ways into the movie, a sort of interesting biographical gap about how Nathaniel Ayers is able to get into Julliard in the first place, and a sort of jarring, unexplained, almost out of character scene with Robert Downey's character's ex-wife as she's drinking. Overall, this drama plays out very well, the characters are presently powerfully and even the element of mental illness is portrayed with sensitivity and humanity. There is almost no melodrama, the ultimate pacing and storyline becomes stronger, more intense without having to resort to overly dramatic acting, and the soft landing at the end transforms this movie more about people and their potential for humanity more than anything. This is a powerful movie with a strong and vibrant message that doesn't preach. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Don't go to this one solo, you'll need someone's hand to hold, as this is an extremely moving tale with tremendous turns by Foxx and Downey, Jr.","Steve Lopez (Robert Donwey, Jr.) is an ace writer for the Los Angeles Times. One day, as he is bicycling in the area, he falls harshly from his bike and ends up in the hospital. Despite a banged-up face, however, he's fine. Not long after, Steve observes a homeless man, Nathaniel (Jamie Foxx) playing a beautiful tune on a two-string violin. Striking up a conversation, Steve soon learns that Nathaniel once went to the prestigious Juilliard School of Music and studied the cello! How is it that the musician is on the streets? Actually, that's very apparent, for Nathaniel is obviously mentally challenged and most likely schizophrenic. Sensing a great column, Steve makes Nathaniel the subject of a future piece. After reading it, an area lady sends Nathaniel, via Steve's office, the cello she can no longer play, due to arthritis. But, Steve knows that it will be stolen if Nathaniel has it in his makeshift home so he makes a bargain with the musician. An area shelter will keep the instrument for him to play on the premises and maybe Nathaniel can consider living there, too? It works, at least for Nathaniel coming to practice the cello. Yet, as Steve gets further connected to Nathaniel as a human being, will he truly be able to make a difference in his life? Don't go to this one solo, my friends, as the tale is so moving and heart-wrenching that you will need a hand to hold. It tackles the subjects of homelessness, mental illness, poverty, music, and charity straightforward, with no sugar coating. As the two main characters, Downey, Jr. and especially Foxx are no less than brilliant and should garner some sort of nominations, if the academies have any sense. Catherine Keener, Tom Hollander, and all of the other cast members are marvelous, too. The setting in Los Angeles is a mixture of the good, the bad, and the ugly and the costuming is wonderful, especially Foxx's unusual clothing items. All other production values are high as well. In brief, if you are a regular cinema attendee or rent/buy works for a home viewing, don't skip this one. It is a richly rewarding and supremely heartfelt film.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Fine biopic and music and poverty film.,"Steve Lopez is not the kind of hero Hollywood bores us with. He's a jerky loner who doesn't care for anybody and, let's face it, he's not a very good guy. He sticks to poor Nathaniel Ayers ""Jr."" just or mainly because he needs an article, then it's a few, when he gets his prize with all the rich & famous people around him we can see he cares little for him. But then again, who does? He did more for one lost sheep than most of us did in our lives. If his intentions are not very angelic, he wants to ""get rid of"" him many times, even once yells in front of the mental asylum inmates: ""I've got a job to do!!"" when he gets exasperated. Very comprehensible, for this film shows without wanting to how difficult it must be to deal with one schizophrenic. The best phrase is Katherine Keener's: ""You can't cure him. But you can be his friend, and be around"". A real shrink. And probably the most beautifully emphatic woman in her forties there is :)!What they can show of poverty in LA is quite interesting given the idealization we foreigners have of ""the US"". The end credits stating it's 90.000 of them is also startling. Here in Lat Am, and probably in the rest of the third world things are far worse. There wouldn't be state/ ONGs delivering warm food every day, nor a nice mental health facility with cool knowledgeable personnel, and no, the major wouldn't show up to give 50 million dollars... If I am allowed to digress, the day we as a society cared for the 90 thousand other homeless, and not for ""the one that went to Julliard and at least was a genius"", then we'd be able to look ourselves in the mirror, so to speak. Music is important, but I expected a bit more. And not so much Beethoven! I liked Pekka-Salonen being in the movie, albeit briefly. I'd liked to know a bit more, how did he come to be a drifter from his Julliard past. We only get to see him suffering at one rehearsal, and attacking his mum. For a 120 minutes film, I'd have liked to know why the authorities didn't ""spot"" him as being mentally sick, instead of letting him basically die in the streets (I was about to throw a pun about the American health system, but I'll refrain :)). I'd like to know a bit more about the sister, how didn't she do much either. She must be on this film for about ... less than one minute.Read Tom Murray on IMDb, he wrote a great critic because he's got experience treating this patients. Not having those credentials, I nevertheless understand what he says about the ""chaos"", jarring music, visuals, etc, is intentional, part of the effort of the film to make us ""be into"" a schizophrenic's head. At least a glimpse of it. At that it succeeds, much more than other films. I am thinking of Canvas (2006) with Marcia Gay Harden and others, which looks like a ""for dummies"" book compared to this one, that wouldn't be the DSM IV but maybe an abridged Kaplan, if you know what I mean :).",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Major spoilers,"SPOILERS MAJOR MAJOR SPOILERS My classmate and I were asked to write a review on the soloist. Within minutes we knew that this was going to be a powerful movie. At first when I was assigned to watch this, movie it seemed a little odd. It didn't really relate to my project topic, but we still watched it anyways. After watching this movie, it made me believe to never give up on our dreams even if you fail the first time around. Steve is a writer for the LA Times and is currently going through divorce. Nathaniel Ayers is a homeless man skid row who has an amazing talent. He is a phenomenal violinist who attended the Juliard School of Music but had to leave because of his struggles with his mental illnesses. When Steve Lopez first meets Nathaniel, he comes across him in a park in Los Angeles playing the violin. Nathaniel seems very intelligent but there are clear sign of an illness. We soon learn that Nathaniel has schizophrenia. He decided to write an article about him in the paper. Steve wanted to learn more about Nathaniel for the article so he contacted his sister. He learned that Nathaniel is a cello prodigy. After one of Steves readers reads about this in the paper, they kindly give Steve a brand new cello for Nathaniel to play. Through out the movie Steve is constantly pushing for Nathaniel to get help for his conditions and for him to get back up on his feet. After an Innocent where Nathaniel loses his temper, he blows an opportunity for his music. Steve arranges for Nathaniel to get help but Nathaniel things he is doing it on his own. When Nathaniel learns that Steve is apart of it, he blows up at Steve and tells him to leave him alone. After Steve speaks to his ex wife Mary, He realizes that not only has he changes Nathaniel's if for the better but Nathaniel has also changes Steve in ways too. My favorite scene was when Steve gave Nathaniel the cello. It really stand out as a token to their friendship and the love someone can give to someone without even knowing them.

I thought it was beautifully portrayed,"I would like to say that this movie takes a lot of pertinent, timely, and ugly truths about modern society - the fact that these are the same ugly truths that have plagued civil societies since two gathering individuals shared what they had and suddenly found themselves wishing the homeless on the corner would just get a job. The reality of the shortcomings of civilized people, in addition with harsh treatment of those with mental issues - both diagnosed and presumed to be diagnosable. The lack of resources - both financial and most importantly the lack of compassion from years of believing that if we just choose the right moment, to convict individuals for the circumstances they find themselves in we may turn victims into criminals and find ourselves sleeping quite well in beds made of others efforts towards our own success. That being said - this movie is beautiful. Not because of what the story is - but at how true regardless of the cast, regardless of the characters. Although much credit need go to those who worked so hard to tell this story - the series of events portrayed could be any single life on this planet. This story could be me, it has been me at times. This story could be my neighbor, my sister, my brother, my friends, strangers. This story could be any one of us. This story makes a lot of points but raises the one question that should for years to follow raise any mind with more sense than to notice their own reflection. That question being how is it in a world of excess that we have not met the challenges for survival adequately enough for all people that we so arrogantly do choose instead to focus outward what intentions we could yet solve inward. We cannot do life without each-other yet we choose to live as if survival is a choice we all must make. That is illogical and in practice it creates the types of cruel, indifferent, compassionless societies that would see their brothers and sisters for want and lack, at the frustration built into a society where survival is a unified purpose yet divides us as if one could be two without the other. I believe in my heart that there are more layers to the telling of this story that are timeless and relevant as they go back all the way to our beginning as a species through present day. You will not convince me that this movie is not one of the best I have ever seen. I have lived - as an able minded person many of the same detriments portrayed and found the same results as those on the streets often do-that our conscience being clear and our nights rest is one of delusion when we say that there are programs, outreach, charities to the degree which we could afford that nights slumber in belief that those victims of life's circumstance shall be adequate or to blame for there present disposition. If i am hungry - I must eat. If I am thirsty, I must drink, If I wish to rest, I must lay. If I need for any of those things I must pay. Thank you. I bought this movie and I love it. Those who would rate it lower must have just been exhausted from solving the worlds actual problems all day and I will not fault them for it.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

The story was told in a respectful and yet crude manner, without hiding the odds of mental illnesses .. Is is eyeopening and questions what our societies are doing about the mentally ill.

terribly underrated,"Two terrific performances by Downey and Foxx in this based-on-real-life look at the relationship between an LA reporter and a schizophrenic homeless musician. Watching the interviews with the real people the film portrays, I was even more impressed with how the screenwriter and actors had caught the dynamic between the two, the speech patterns of Ayers, and the inner world of the schizophrenic. I loved what Ayers sees, with closed eyes, during the performance of the Eroica, an abstract synaesthetic wonder.This film could have been made specifically for me. I love Beethoven, for one thing-- so the score is a pure delight. I've usually had pleasant interactions with street people. I like schizophrenics. I never assume when such a person says to me that they can see/hear something I cannot that I am right and they are wrong; I often suspect they are seeing something I'm too limited to see and just having a hard time putting it into words I can understand. And the ones I've connected with are smart and interesting and insightful; they're a delight to listen to. There's nothing here of the errors of Beautiful Mind, no simplistic pro-pharma,drug-the-genius-out-of-them worldview. And yet the schizophrenia is not innocuous here; it is sometimes a danger to Ayers and others. This is real mental illness, not Hollywood mental illness.I suspect that is why the film has a low rating. Filmviewers--American in particular--want a clear simplistic story that matches the false narrative they get on commercial TV, the simple metanarratives they hear on talk shows (sponsored by big pharma, in part, but people aren't very good about applying critical consciousness to facts like that). They likely don't want their limited worldviews shaken.This is happy story, though it doesn't provide a Capraesque treacly ending. The uplift here is that one human being actually *saw* another human being and accepted him for what he is. This is a rare enough event in human interaction it qualifies as ""weird news."" As novelist Irish Murdoch said, ""Love is the difficult realization that something other than oneself is real."" This film is a moving portrait of real human love, not a love that seeks to change the other, but that accepts the beloved.That this is rated lower here (and even by many critics) than typically awful horror films or comic book-based movies is a tragedy, yet is unsurprising. Perhaps the film is rated low because it subtly tells you, you can make the world a better place by behaving like Lopez, but it isn't easy, and the work never ends. You have to work on yourself too. The film challenges you. It doesn't say there are clear bad guys; it doesn't say the mentally ill and homeless are ""them"" and we're safe over here on our side in our difference. It says, everybody is a person, equal in his worth. It's a revolutionary message.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A Drama for the modern mind- The Soloist,"The Soloist is the real life story of Los Angeles Times journalist Steve Lopez and his friendship with the homeless, mentally unstable yet exceptionally talented musician Mr. Nathaniel Ayers. Steve Lopez covers the story of how a Jilliard dropout with such exceptional music gifts ended out on the streets and while covering the story, Lopez, played by Robert Downey Jr., develops a special bond with the musician, Nathaniel, played by Jamie Foxx.The movie shows the tragic, disease-ridden and crime –afflicted world of Los Angeles streets. It shows how this world has been completely abandoned by the authorities, by the hospitals who do not care about the sick, the police who do not care about the well-being of the homeless and also by the work-oriented populace of the city who do not stop even for a second to listen to the talented musician playing Beethoven on the street.The story presents a view point of how people need to move away from the socially accepted strands of ""normalcy"". The movie says that one need not always think about how to ""cure"" a mentally challenged person but instead should just accept them for who they are and be their friends. Friendship with the journalist actually helps Nathaniel while his every step to try and fit him according to the socially accepted behavior goes in vain, to say the least.The film also deals with the power of friendship and how it has the power to make each one of us into better human beings.This is a movie for the modern mind. It definitely changes one's idea of how to deal with a mentally challenged person. Beethoven's symphonies played in the movie are delightful to listen to. The film definitely has the power to make one a better person.So, I recommend everyone to watch this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"6, are you serious?","As someone who has worked with mental ill adults, someone who has some empathy for their plight, and who thought this was a rare reflection of the human condition and how important being validated/valued is for anyone. I thought this was a 10. This is an example of the highest form of movies. A friend recently told me about ""Temple Grandin."" Other great movies in this genre include ""A Beautiful Mind"" ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" ""Shine"" ""I Am Sam"" etc. Robert Downey and Jamie Foxx killed it in their individual roles. Each should have at least been nominated for Oscars... Well perhaps USA is too hot on low brow entertainment, quick edited action scenes, fast paced, minimal plot development, exciting but ultimately meaningless entertainment? Perhaps most of America should just go back to watching Honey Boo Boo?",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A Decent Melodrama!,"The Soloist is one of those films I remember not living up to its hype, especially when it came to Oscar season. Perhaps that is why I skipped that film until now. It's really not a bad film at all, led by two central performances from Jamie Foxx and Robert Downey Jr. Granted, the film moves at a snail-like pace at times, but this melodrama brings to light some important issues such as mental disorders and homelessness. These two subjects should not be said in the same sentence, but in the case of Nathaniel Ayers, it unfortunately is the case.Based on a true story, Joe Wright's film is about a LA Times reporter named Steve Lopez who has a chance encounter with a homeless schizophrenic named Nathaniel Avery, who is incredibly gifted with the cello. Steve decides to use him as a story topic and in the process, a friendship was forged.The film is well-acted because of the two incredibly gifted actors in the lead. Jamie Foxx showed dramatic acting chops in 2004's Ray, and now he does so again in the Soloist. This may not be the best portrayal with this subject (Russell Crowe was better in 2001's A Beautiful Mind), but it was still a powerful performance nonetheless. Robert Downey Jr did a great job as the reporter who introduced this man to the world.Overall, The Sololist is a solid melodrama, although it's nothing special. The performances were excellent and I liked the story itself. The screenplay is a little weak and a little confusing at times, so thank heavens for Foxx and Downey! Poverty has always been a big issue in LA, but it seems like LA is the homeless capital of the world. A very important theme of this movie. A good, watchable melodrama. I rate this film 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A true look at a heartbreaking disease...,"The Soloist was a movie I had an inkling I would really like. And, as it turned out, I did. This was in no small part to the great performances the two leads, Jamie Foxx and Robert Downey Jr. Of course, the direction by Joe Wright (Atonement) was wonderful.Based on a true story, Downey plays New York Times columnist, Steve Lopez, who in the search for a juicy story, comes across a homeless guy (Jamie Foxx) playing a violin in the park. The guy tells him that his name is Nathaniel Ayers and he used to be in Juliard. Lopez sees the possibility of a juicy story and decides to follow it up. Over the next few months, the movie traces how their relationship grows from merely one of a reporter and his subject to that of two men genuinely growing to be friends and caring for each other. Lopez, though always uncomfortable at Ayers placing too much of trust and affection in him, realizes that he too cares for him and tries all he can to help him out.What marks the movie out are the way Foxx's characters dementia is handled and shown, as well as the bond between the two men. It seems so rare these days in Hollywood to see a true story of friendship and love between two guys in a totally non-Brokeback way. One of the few I do remember is that modern classic, The Shawshank Redemption. In the end, the movie is honest in portraying Ayer's condition, but at the same time, hopeful of the changes that love and friendship can bring about.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Based on a true story.,"A homeless person to most of us is like an unsightly moth which fly into our field of vision uninvited and unwelcome. How many of us actually ponder how these street dwellers come to be that way? Joe Wright who directed the wonderful 'Atonement' explores this forgotten colony by focusing the tale on one Nathaniel Ayers. A child prodigy of cello, Ayers seemed like a musical miracle waiting to ascend the starlit skies. Accepted to Juilliard and ready to take on the world, he is instead struck down by an imbalanced mind. Steve Lopez, the writer for Los Angeles Times just stumbles on Mr Ayers one fine afternoon and a friendship which empowers both of these opposites of society unfolds. Foxx has shown time and again that his talent in acting is no fluke. This is another film in which he literally embodies the character. Based on a true story.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Great depiction of Schizophrenia,"For anyone curious about the mentally ill, especially Schizophrenia, I think this is a VERY good film. My daughter suffered terribly from the disease. When you are sick, your brain tells you to go to the doctor. When your brain is sick, what do you do? The feelings portrayed by the musicians was well presented by Hollywood. I am sure it was not a truly accurate depiction of events and it is truly sad if none of the proceeds from this film went to help the mentally ill. I know many people look at dirty homeless people with disgust. They should at least get their act together enough to work at McDonalds, right? At one time, I thought like this. Then when my own talented, beautiful girl got sick.....couldn't eat...people were poisoning her.....voices were yelling at her.....bugs were crawling on her.....my perception of everything changed. It is an awful, frightening disease. It is as bad, if not worse, than cancer, heart disease and diabetes. I think the film was well done from both the entertainment and educational factor.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
The Writer And The Musician,"'The Soloist' came as a pleasant surprise. For some reason, I thought it was an action film but what it turned out to be is a moving human drama. I love movies about unusual friendship and this one is based on the true story of an L.A. columnist, Goerge Lopez, and a homeless schizophrenic but talented musician, Nathaniel Ayres. Joe Wright does a splendid job as director. With stunning cinematography, he gives raw glimpses of the L.A. streets and the alleys where the homeless, addicts and criminals reside. He avoids sugarcoating the story and mainly stays focused on the two friends. Lopez is in search of an original story and his lackluster attempts just get him more frustrated until one day he suddenly hears a beautiful piece of music played on violin by a homeless man. George's encounter with Nathaniel inspires him to write Ayres's story which gradually touches the lives of many. We also see the growth of a beautiful friendship and this affects George as he becomes determined to help treat Ayres but when his attempts fail, he is frustrated with himself for not being able to do anything. I loved the soundtrack, especially the pieces played by Ayres. Robert Downey Jr. and Jamie Foxx deliver very natural performances by playing their parts with utmost conviction. Catherine Keener too does an equally standout job. The only flaw to me was the ending which I felt was a little too rushed. 'The Soloist' is an impressive study of character and I'm glad that it did not turn out to be an action film but instead something bigger and richer.",,Anonymous,Music
The Soloist is a saga about the Meeting of two people,"This movie, at first glance, may seem very simple in its plot. And at the same time, this is a deep recognition of the true purpose of man, given to him by the Creator. This film is precisely about the meeting of two people, which could not fail to happen.It was vital to both main characters of this film. It was inevitable. In this meeting, the character of Steve Lopez (Robert Downey, Jr.) helping a talented homeless musician named Nathaniel Anthony Ayers (Jamie Foxx), who suffers from a mental disorder, revealed in himself the qualities of humanity that he did not have until a certain time vitally necessary. Humanity, sensitivity, mercy, kindness. This film is about how, at the moment of the desire to give and help, an unknown source of light opens up in a person, which can change and save someone's life, someone's Universe. And then another soul is revealing in response, even a very sick one. And a Miracle happens.The plot develops rather slowly, accompanied by beautiful music, as if it allows you to see the process of reincarnation of the main characters in small details.In my opinion, this is a very important film. His idea is simple and vitally necessary for each of us.",,Anonymous,Music
Downey Is Great but Poor Direction Sinks the Overall Tone,"Robert Downey Jr. does not disappoint. He brings his ""A-Game"" and then some as he delivers a compelling and layered performance. The rest of the cast (including Foxx) is remarkably average. That has more to do with the writing then the quality of the actors themselves. What hurts this film seems to be the director. You can feel his heavy hand on too many scenes. It's almost as if you can see him trying to find a way to make the film more compelling but failing at every turn. Strobe crazy lights filling the entire screen linked to the music, snot filled babies on TV, chaotic voices in surround sound trying to give the audience the feel of losing grip on reality...they all fail. Maybe the story itself didn't warrant feature length film consideration and drawing out the film didn't help matters. RDJr does make up for a lot of flaws and the stagnant pace but only to a certain degree.",,Anonymous,Music
How similar the mad man's mind is to the sane!,"As I'm listening to the reporter spell the schizophrenic's name to the nurse, I'm thinking, ""This is just like Mr. Ayer's spelling his name to the reporter."" This was a continuing thought as we progressed through the movie....the similarities between the life of the insane and the sane.I learned so much about mental illness. The explanation that the schizophrenic's synapses get his thoughts mixed up in his auditory system was quite revealing. But then, what causes the 'voices' that dictate murderous actions? How much poetic license was taken in this excellent movie? The burning car early on in this boy's life made me think that he was hallucinating then. Allowing the homeless to take part in the movie was great. This was a wonderful way to bring insight into the minds of some of the homeless. Each one has his own story. I sometimes volunteer at the ARlington Street church in Boston, serving meals. The conversations I have with their clients are much like the conversations I have at work with my fellow software engineers. ""But you're seeing them on their meds"", says an old hand. Why wouldn't a sick person take those meds? The homeless lady gave us the reason: ""Those voices comfort me. On my meds, I don't hear them."" A fantastic movie and a great plug for Los Angeles. To think that someone could be so claustrophobic that being inside a house would freak them out is a revelation to someone (cest moi) who considers herself claustrophobic. The comment by the mental health worker, ""There is no such thing as insanity"" really jibes with Dr. Laing's opinion that insanity is a culturally defined condition. But how do you deal with the violence-producing convictions brought on by paranoia, as we saw Mr. Ayers turn on both the reporter and the cello teacher at the 'recital'? It's hard to think that an intelligent, sensitive man such as that cello teacher wouldn't know enough NOT to bring in religion, which for many of us has nothing but negative connotations because of the evil effect perversions of Christianity in our early life in Alabama had on us. This just brings out the fact that everyone of us saw a different movie, as we traveled both men's journey, and experienced the sensitivity of the insane soloist and the insensitivity of the sane reporter.The acting by both Foxx and the actor who played the reporter deserve Oscar nominations, if quality of acting rather than superior publicity machinations is more valued this year. What is so chilling is that for about $16,000 a person, we could get this problem solved, but then we'd have to truly be a compassionate nation, instead of pretending we are, wouldn't we?",,Anonymous,Music
Moving and intelligent,"It's a shame that this movie has been given such a low-key release in both the USA and the UK because it is an intelligent and moving story that is beautifully directed and superbly acted. Direction comes from Britain's Joe Wright, who did such a fine job with ""Atonement"" (another film based on a book), and he uses some great aerial shots and allows time for the music to work its magic. The lead actors are Robert Downey Jr - who has had his own lifestyle problems - as ""Los Angeles Times"" columnist Steve Lopez and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Ayers, a musical prodigy, probably now schizophrenic, reduced to playing a two-string violin as a vagrant on the city's sidewalks.In a sense, we've been here before, since music and mania make good cinema - think of mentally ill pianist David Helfgott in ""Shine"" or even Mozart in ""Amadeus"" - and Beethoven is a favoured classical composer for the movies (remember everything from ""Soylent Green"" to ""Zardoz"" and especially ""A Clockwork Orange""). But this is a tale worth telling because it is based on a true story, offers a sensitive narration, and exposes an important social issue, namely the relationship between homelessness and mental illness. Also it avoids a neat, simplistic ending, instead inviting us to consider how we can befriend and support people rather than necessarily 'mend' them.",,Anonymous,Music
"Excellent Foxx, good Downey, lame direction (Wright)","I was curious to see why was this film a distinctive looser among otherwise excellent Wright's films. It's hard to guess how and why it happened (the crack in L.A.'s air maybe? :-) but he completely lost any sense of pacing, building up and maintaining the momentum. Kind of as if he was doing a documentary instead of a feature with a sizable budget. One even has to wonder where on earth did all that money go?Part of the problem is the script that was way too much burdened by trying to be ""true to life"" of actual Steve Lopez which is rather boring. Actual Lopez just talks/writes drivel on and on and on and it's natural to him since he's a journalist. A dramatist needs to have the sense of building up a momentum and making characters more intense and colorful than they are in real life or the audience falls a sleep.So the principal fault of Joe Wright as a director was that he didn't tear a lame script to shreds but followed it and even worse go influenced by it and made the film even more flat, slow and boring. If doesn't help to have one Jamie Foxx who can deliver as much intensity as you'd let him when you don't let him. It doesn't help to have Robert Downey when you force him to be a talking head. It doesn't help to have an ex wife as a figurehead when you don't develop some juice and intensity without being self-conscious about whether actual Lopez had some juice with his ex or not.Full feature film is not a documentary and fails every time it tries to be. That's the principal rule that Joe Wright forgot while making this film and Foxx and Downey bailed him out only to a degree to which they were allowed to. It also looks like Catherine Keener was ready and willing to do much juicier ex wife but also wasn't allowed to.",,Anonymous,Music
Crying from the outside,"Another film about life with a damaged mind. Films of this sort often deal with mathematical or musical minds so that we can find in the apparent mess not just a handicap, but a reaching out and capacity for order and beauty. Focusing on genius however kind of obscures what's really at stake. In simple terms, if the protagonist of Shine wasn't a child prodigy would there be a film about him?The film is open about this motivation, selfaware, by having the snappy journalist, a surrogate for the filmmaker himself, drawn to the schizophrenic homeless musician among thousands of a similar fate because this one makes for an enhanced story.What matters for me though is what kind of salvation are we drawn to find. This is worthwhile in many aspects. The inspirational beauty comes less from any extraordinary playing, there is no triumphant final performance as in Shine, and more from the fact of his complete immersion in music. We get to see both the damage, the voices and paranoid storytelling inside the mind, and the enhanced capacity beyond: music as abstract color vision, the rapture of the immersion itself.The final realization is that nothing matters more than simply being in reach for another person, a gently skiing support instead of any patronizing panacea.I like all these things here, but at the same time it's a matter of evoking it as awareness. We perfectly sane minds of the audience (right) want to rediscover this capacity for immersion that eludes us in the outer shell of normalcy, it's why we watch films among other things. We need to be reminded that normal life has no logical purpose of its own without the commitment to someone. All this means that we want to experience film as madly as Ayers experiences music, the distance into which self dissolves into insight (this being narrative depth); but come out whole, lucid.But there's no distance when you simply tell us; no value. In Ice Storm we get the same realization of holding each other into place but layered and visual. Woman Under the Influence is the real masterpiece in this vein: even more gruelling life with a schizophrenic than here, but enlightens by asking of us as viewers to experience the commitment and immersion, and this being the most important thing, one as the other, in other words we can immerse ourselves in the film and find value only if we commit to being a part of that life, nothing less will do. In the marvelous end, the gentle support doesn't have to be announced, it's there in two people simply taking care of the same house before going to bed.This cries on its skin, enlightens in words, asks only the appearance of commitment.",,Anonymous,Music
