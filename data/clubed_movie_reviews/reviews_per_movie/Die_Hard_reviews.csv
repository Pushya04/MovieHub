"Now I Have a Machine Gun, Ho-Ho-Ho","In stepped John McTiernan and Bruce Willis with Die Hard. Willis, most famous at the time for the comic TV Series 'Moonlighting', made a perfect ordinary-man-in-an-extraordinary-situation action hero. He was believable as John McClane and not immune to being hurt. He bled and felt pain, a first for the genre. And yet his cool confident delivery of a great wisecracking, intelligent script made him all the cooler. But most credit should go to Director John McTiernan, king of the sophisticated action flick. He made action movies slick, smart and full of pace and wit while never letting up on the bullets, cars and bombs front.Special praise must go out to Alan Rickman too whose performance as chief baddie Hans is to this day one of cinemas finest, moving convincingly from cool, calm and collected to desperate and nervous, never once seeming anything less than utterly ruthless and calculating. Even after we discover that Hans isn't there as a political terrorist but simply as a thief, he loses absolutely no villain credibility when he responds to Holly McClane's criticism by saying ""I am an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane and since I'm moving to kidnapping you should be more polite."" Although we know Hans is capable of vile acts, he actually sees those as merely means to a greater and somehow justifiable end. His disposition is almost humanitarian and you would imagine him as quite a gentleman outside of the context of the crimes he commits in Die Hard's arc. In the end though, Hans is a pure sociopath that even the audience is conned into sympathizing with. I would actually argue that Die Hard is the greatest pure action film ever made. Yippie-ki-yay *muddy funster*... and happy holidays.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
THE best action flick ever !,"""Nine million terrorists in the world and I gotta kill one with feet smaller than my sister.""Well, what else can I say besides that this is ""THE"" (can't stress it more) action movie from the 80's with a young Bruce Willis. Personally, I don't even know how many times I've seen this movie. ""Die Hard"" remains an example for all action movies that followed. At that time you had the Sly and Arnie action movies. But these were more a performance of brutal violence, with big muscles and a sense of invincibility. Bruce showed a clever, shrewd, caustic action hero, who can take a beating, but on the other hand shows that he's not completely invincible.Of course, the action in films nowadays is much bigger, more impressive and mind-blowing, but the strength of this film is the story, the accumulated tension, lightness and the dry humor of Bruce Willis. From the first minute he takes you in his grip, and he won't let loose. You see him slowly evolve from a wrinkle-free clean-shaved top cop into a reasonable damaged hero. This pattern keeps coming back in the next two parts, which are also top movies of the same caliber.You'll notice this is already an old movie because for instance lighting a cigarette in a public place isn't prohibited. But how the action scenes are imaged, is still top-work and should be the aim for many action flicks.I think the sudden confrontation between Gruber and McClane is one of the strongest scenes in this film, along with the well known ""Yippie-kay-yee"" cry. Trademark of Willis. The fact he likes the character of McClane a lot, you see clearly in ""The Last boyscout"". In that movie he plays an impoverished detective with the same coolness and cynical, dry humor as McClane. Too bad that in the last two Die Hard movies, McClane is only a shadow of himself like in the original movie.""Die Hard"" is one of those rarities in movie land, which you can watch without thinking ""Pfft Again this movie"". It remains, for me, an enjoyment to watch.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Influential and revolutionary action movie that redefined its genre,"In the late 1980s, Director John McTiernan refined the action film genre with this action- packed thriller that not only stars Bruce Willis is the role that defined his career, but also brought impressed audiences everywhere with ecstatic action sequences complete with amazing practical effects, inspiring characters, and one of the most original scripts for an action movie written for its time. This movie stars Bruce Willis as John McClane, a New York cop who heads on vacation to Los Angeles for the holidays, to spend Christmas with his wife Holly Genero (played by Bonnie Bedelia) and kids. Upon arriving at the Nakatomi Plaza building where she works, he and his wife ended having an argument dealing with family matters. Their dispute is eventually interrupted when the building becomes under attack by a dozen German terrorists lead by the ruthless Hans Gruber (played by Alan Rickman) who's intent on robbing the company of its money. Pitted against overwhelming odds and Gruber's diabolical mind, John McClane must take matters into his own hands and fight off the terrorists who have his wife, along with hundreds of innocent civilians held hostage, with no aid from the Los Angeles Police Department who are helpless against the terrorists' overwhelming power.My family and I catch this fi on cable almost every year during the Christmas season and this never gets old. Unlike other action films from the 80s that spit cheesy little one-liners and mindless gun shootouts, this film presents viewers with a very likable protagonist who is self aware with his flaws and has feels very human, a Villain who is near equally likable and incredibly smart, and the dialogue between these two characters (which are spoken via walkie-talkies for the majority of the time) is very witty and clever that keep viewers' attention. The main character John McClane spends most of the time fighting off the terrorists who are lead by Hans Gruber, and the scenes are exciting to watch. Glossing with intense gunfights, explosions, stellar camera-work and fight choreography, the scenes keep viewers strapped to their seats. In the scenes when the action lightens up, there are some interesting conversations between characters like McClane, who at one point, shares a tender moment with a cop by admitting his flaws as a husband and a man as a whole. These moments are make you feel for the character and are presented in a realistic way and not sappy way. Bruce Willis does an excellent job as the main character and his performances him as the action hero he is today, along with his famous line ""Yippie Kay Yay, motherf***er"". The same can be said about Alan Rickman is gives off a performances as the one of the most charismatic antagonists ever put on screen. What really impresses me about this film is the action set pieces. The Nakatomi Plaza that serves as the film's main setting (at least during the beginning) is shot nowhere other than Twentieth Century Fox headquarters. Quite interesting!Die Hard is one of the most influential action films ever made and shines with nearly every aspect an action film needs. It is a good movie for viewers to pop a bag of popcorn, sit on the couch, and watch. Director John McTiernan did a fantastic job with this film as well as the cast. This film is a textbook example of what action films need to be and a movie that every action fan should not miss.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
It can't be bettered,"This original action classic has been hugely influential over the years - and it's no surprise, as it's one of the best action thrillers ever made. New meaning is brought to the word ""action"" as here it is exhilarating, furious and nothing less than exciting. The premise is simple: one location, one good guy and twelve bad guys. Cue lots of explosions, fist fights, blood, violence, and plenty of shooting too. The thrills come from the suspense of Willis using his wits as well as his brawn to fight the bad guys and save the hostages.When watching this film what becomes immediately apparent is how fresh it is. This hasn't been filmed with some cheap cameras for a quick buck, it looks professional and couldn't be less polished. The photography is clear and brings out the best of the surroundings, while the music has obviously been carefully chosen to convey the right mood. And, strangely enough for an action film, the acting is actually very good. Unheard of, as remember this was back in the days where Schwarzenegger and Stallone were the top stars of the action genre. Bruce Willis excels as the wisecracking, sardonic cop, and you can't fail to like him. He's consistently witty and provides a powerful presence when needed - it comes as no surprise as he lived off this image for the next six or seven years.The supporting cast aren't half bad, either. The reliable Bonnie Bedelia takes a break from her usual highbrow, ""moral dilemma"", television movie fare as Willis' tough wife, while Reginald Veljohnson is also great as a sympathetic cop - you just want to hug him. But most memorable of all is Alan Rickman for his excellent turn as the cool, calculating terrorist with a carefully-crafted German accent and a fine line in natty suits. Rickman is THE bad guy of modern cinema, watch any subsequent action film with terrorists and you'll see people trying to be him. He's that good. The rest of the cast of terrorists have all been picked for their imposing looks, and they're not bad either. Keep your eyes peeled for fearsome Bond baddie Robert Davi in a minor role as an FBI man.As well as the tense running around in corridors and stand-offs between Willis and the various creeps, this film really delivers in the action stakes. The guys here really do look like they are trying their hardest to kill each other, and we get people flying down stairs, getting chains wrapped around their necks, getting shot all over the place. Every kill that Willis makes is original and exciting. There are also plenty of ace stunts, like when Willis jumps off an exploding roof with only a fire hose tied around his waist. The gore level is high, graphic in fact, with people being shot apart wherever you look, and it's definitely a film for all cinema fans to enjoy. Consistently entertaining and strong enough to withstand repeated viewings, this is the first and final word on the ""one guy versus lots of bad guys"" sub-genre of the action flick.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Not only the best of the Die Hard franchise but one of the best movies of the action genre,"Even if the non-action parts are a tad slow in comparison, that is more than compensated by so many things that makes Die Hard so brilliant.For one thing the action is explosive and consistently exciting, and the cinematography is astounding being very inventive and colourful. John McTiernon(The Hunt for Red October, Last Action Hero) directs briskly and efficiently, and the pacing a vast majority of the time is exhilarating.Then there is a terrific score by Michael Kamen, some intelligent and witty scripting and a plot that doesn't feel forced or convoluted. Not to mention some excellent acting. As good as Bruce Willis is, yes his character is somewhat two-dimensional, but he is also resourceful and world-weary and Willis handles this really well, it is Alan Rickman who steals the acting honours as Hans Gruber. Gruber is cold, calculating, suave and menacing, in my opinion only Rickman could do justice to such a character. Overall, a superb movie, not only the best of the Die Hard franchise but one of the best of the action genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Action
The Perfect Modern Action Film,"""Die Hard"" is the prototype type for the modern action film.  Since it's also one of the best action films ever made, that happens to be a very good thing.  ""Die Hard"" is lean, mean, and doesn't contain a single second of wasted screen time. The direction, the action, the story, the acting . . . every aspect of this film comes close to big-budget action movie perfection. Since ""Die Hard"" was first released in 1988, it's difficult to think of a blockbuster action film that doesn't follow the basic structure and format of ""Die Hard"" . . . or, for that matter, is better than ""Die Hard"".""Die Hard"" is about John McClane (Bruce Willis, in one of his all-time best film performances), a basically good, honest New York cop with a penchant for annoying authority figures.   Traveling to Los Angeles in a last ditch attempt to patch things up with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), John McClane suddenly finds himself involved in a hostage situation. Terrorists, led by the enigmatic Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), have taken over the office building in which Holly is working, and with Gruber holding the upper hand over the LAPD and FBI forces in Los Angeles, it's up to John McClane to save the day . . . .Kudos should be given to both director John McTiernan and screenwriters Jeb Stuart and Steven DeSouza -- the film is tight, electrifying, and clever, which is something few action films can ever claim.  The story isn't completely believable, but it's believable enough, and it manages to move along at a quick enough pace to where the most glaring plotholes can easily be glossed over.  There's also enough twists and wrinkles thrown into the story to keep the audience guessing as to what's going to happen next . . . and the surprises don't come out of left field, but are actually clever and well thought-out.  (The fact that McClane often relies on his brains instead of his bullets to get out of his predicaments is also a big plus.) Simply put, ""Die Hard"" is one of the smartest and savviest action screenplays ever written.  McTiernan holds up his end of the film admirably as well -- he uses the claustrophobic nature of the office building to great effect (particularly in any scene involving an elevator shaft), and he keeps the film rolling at a rollercoaster pace, building up the anticipation of the audience before unleashing the action.  A lot of recent action films just fly along at a mindless, breakneck pace, without ever allowing the story to breathe or the suspense to build . . . unlike those films, ""Die Hard"" knows how to maximize the impact of each and every scene, and that's why it stands out so clearly from them all.  With ""Die Hard"", John McTiernan puts on a perfect clinic as to how to pace an action movie.As for the acting, it's darn near close to perfect.  Bruce Willis is awesome as John McClane.  As played by Willis, McClane's a smartass with a distinct disdain for being given orders . . . but McClane's also clever, and knows how to keep cool under pressure.  There's more to McClane than the stereotypical tough guy hero.  Fortunately, the role was given to Bruce Willis, who infuses McClane with the perfect mix of cocky arrogance and stone-cold heroism.  The fact that Willis plays McClane as a man often in disbelief of his own situation, and who struggles in his fight against bad guys instead of just killing bad guys with ease, like most stereotypical action heroes -- well, not only does it make the character much more believable, it's darn brilliant.  (The fact that Willis also knows how to deliver a deadpan one-liner better than anybody else in Hollywood makes the character all the better.)  There's only a handful of movies where both character and actor are a completely perfect match; Bruce Willis as John McClane is one such perfect match.Also worthy of mention is Alan Rickman's performance as the villain Hans Gruber.  The Machiavellian Gruber would've been an easy villain to turn into little more than a scenery-chewing Bond villain . . . fortunately, Rickman doesn't travel the easy route.  Gruber, as played by Rickman, is cold and calculating, and actually acts smart, instead of merely claiming to be smart and then being thoroughly outwitted by the hero.  He always appears to have an ace hidden up his sleeve, and is so convincing at giving this impression, it's hard to tell throughout the film whether he or McClane truly have the upper hand.  Other actors probably could've played Gruber fairly well, but Rickman makes Gruber one of the all-time great villains.  As for the rest of the cast, they're all pretty good.  Bonnie Bedelia does a nice job as John's soon-to-be-ex-wife Holly -- she plays her with enough smarts and feistiness to break the usual ""damsel in distress"" mold.  It's also worth mentioning that Paul Gleason, who plays the obstinate police chief Robinson, pretty much sets up the modern action movie stereotype of the authority figure who refuses to heed the advice of the maverick hero.  The character is stupid to a fault, and he's wonderful because of it.""Die Hard"" is a terrific example of what happens when all the pieces of a film fall together perfectly.  There simply are no weak spots or dull moments in the film.  Is ""Die Hard"" one of the best overall movies ever made?  Probably not.  But it's undeniably one of the best action movies ever made, and it just might well be the perfect modern action film.  Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,Action
A perfect action film,"Bruce Willis is stirring up trouble for the bad guys in ""Die Hard."" In the first of three awesome films, he stars as Lt. John McClane, a New York police officer, who has been invited to the wrong Christmas party.This is an action film for future actors and directors to watch and use as a model because it is what an action film should be. I have seen many action films in my life, but this ranks at the top as it has all the right components. Action packed sequences, explosions, special effects and most of all superb performances with excellent dialogue.""Die Hard"" is a movie I will not soon forget because the story is so well crafted. Though there are no twists or curves thrown at the audience, the audience can be assured they will be treated to two hours of non-stop action from beginning to end.""Die Hard"" did not only produce great action and explosions but future stars as well. I am talking about Clarence Gilyard Jr. who starred in Walker, Texas Ranger and Reginald VelJohnson who starred in the series ""Family Matters."" These two actors were pivotal to this film in their respective roles.Two other names to keep in mind while thinking of key performers are Bonnie Bedelia and Alan Rickman. I was blown away when I saw the impact they had on this film. It is as if they came in and said 'Okay boys, watch out I'm taking over."" They certainly did that; however, nobody could have done better than the impact performer himself Bruce Willis.On a scale of 1-10; ""Die Hard"" is given a 100 by yours truly. My only regret would be that the movie ended. I wish there was more to see in this film. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE ""DIE HARD"" AGAIN.",,Anonymous,Action
Actually a good Christmas movie.,"I've got to admit, I only really watched this movie because of the (many, many) references in Brooklyn 99. And I got thinking, is Die Hard really that good? So, I gave it a watch, guided by the many, many Jake Peralta jokes that I had grown accustomed to. And I've got to say, this is the action movie that paved the way for all future action movies.I usually have an aversion to Christmas movies as they all tend to turn into cheesy rom-coms but this was pretty awesome. And I think the reason for that is because that even though it was Christmassy where it mattered, the plot didn't completely revolve around it.I've got to admit, most of it was guns and explosions and there was very little plot to go off of besides a pretty traditional three-act structure, but it was still pretty damn entertaining. And you know it's a good movie when about 90% of it was guns and blood and explosions and the other 10% was Bruce Willis saying badass things and crawling through vents in an ever-disintegrating tank top, and you stilled enjoyed it.There was never a still moment in this movie, but unlike most times, where I just end up getting bored of the CGI-fest explosions, I was actually pretty captivated through the entire runtime. I'm actually really pleasantly surprised. The ending is predictable, but it's nice. Not all movies have to be intellectual masterpieces. Sometimes you just need to switch your brain of a little and watch Bruce Willis kick ass.So, Jake of B99 was right. I mean, it's badass, Bruce Willis has the best one-liners, you have cool explosions. There's not too much more I could say about this movie. Yippie kayak, other buckets.-Sasha.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
The ultimate thrill-ride – and still the standard by which I judge an action movie,"Seeing 'Die Hard' for the first time as a teenager was a one-of-a-kind experience. This level of raw, ""edge-of-your-seat"" action was unknown to me prior to this film; it made my head spin and the intensity of it was nearly unbearable. When it was over, I could only think of one word: Wow!For a long time - at least in western cinema - the only ""true"" action movies (by that I mean films that were all about the action and you went to see them because of the action) were the 'James Bond' movies. They had the most unreal stunts and crazy, over the top action sequences that you could imagine at the time, and they were (and still are) great fun. However, they usually lacked three vital ingredients:1. A sense of realism (meaning: the hero is only human and can get hurt)2. Grit (messy, unpolished action, dirty people and LOTS of swearing)3. R-rated violence (showing the audience what real weapons do to the human body)Well, it took John McTiernan to bring those three key elements together in 'Die Hard' - and thus the modern action film was born (it had a good run through the late eighties until the end of the nineties – then the studios figured out they could maximise the box-office by taming down the swearing, violence and sex and thus, alas, the contemporary, toothless PG-13 action film was born). Sure, there have been a couple of others before McTiernan's masterpiece ('First Blood', 'Terminator', 'Predator' - which was also by McTiernan - or 'Lethal Weapon' and probably some more), but those films could have fallen into any number of other categories as well ('Adventure-/Survival-/War-', 'Sci- Fi', 'Horror-' or 'Buddy-movie') – and I can't think of another film that was just such a relentless, pure-action-from-the-beginning-to-the-end film as was 'Die Hard'. To me, it's the ultimate thrill ride. The formula has since been repeated so many times, but the original still sets the standard by which I judge an action film.

How An Action Movie Should Be Made,"1988 and the undisputed number one action star was that Austrian body builder with the funny name with that monosylabic guy from ROCKY in second place . The thing I hated about Arnie and Sly is that their action movies were uninvolving with over blown battle scenes where the good guys never seemed to be in danger of dying . I was also going to bring the James Bond franchise into the conversation but the series became a parody when Bond stopped speaking with a Scottish accent sometime in the early 70sDIE HARD is different to the other 80s action fests with John McLane being a fairly believable genre character . Okay he`s two dimensional but that`s got to be one dimension more than John Rambo who only exists to kill a lot of nasty commies so Americans can flock to the cinema . It`s also interesting to note that McLane`s wife is used in the plot which is slightly different from how most action films work out where the hero is normally single , but that`s probably because DIE HARD as more depth to it than many contemparies. Perhaps the biggest difference is that McLane is slightly flawed as we`re shown one scene where the hero gives the bad guys something they want , not something you`d see in a Arnie or Sly movie . I won`t mention the stunts or the tightly written set pieces or how compelling they are because everyone else has beat me to it , except to say that big explosions and gun fights often overwhelm an action movie ( Bond movies are a good example ) but here they occur from the narrative instead of someone cramming them into the script in a vain attempt to thrill the audience .Normally I`d have a fit that an action blockbuster is well inside the IMDB top 250 but DIE HARD does deserve to be there since it`s the best movie of its type of its era .",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Die Hard,"Yup. That's the title I'm giving this short review. Nothing else comes to mind that would do it more justice. The time is 1988, a young Bruce Willis stars as Officer John McClane in an excellently built, explosive late 80's action classic that actually runs at about 2hrs10min but is a blast to watch. It's not perfect. It's got its flaws. But to hell with those, this is just too much fun to not be watched, and even if you're the intellectual kind, if you like cinema, check this out as it is a lesson on how to make a campy, action-filled thriller the right way. It's a bit long, and yeah the relationship with the black cop is a bit rushed during the ending scene... but the cunning intelligent villain is here, vs the anti-hero, guns, big explosions, the cops, the mischievous lines Willis delivers...this is fun man. It's no masterpiece but it's just fun. Just pick it up and, have fun. It's all this is, although it takes real knowledge to do it well and smooth.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Average at best,"New York City cop John McClane has flown to Los Angeles to reconcile with his estranged wife, Holly. He arrives on Christmas Eve and heads to Holly's office, where her company's Christmas party is in full swing. Holly does not work for some ordinary company. She works for the Nakatomi Corporation, whose headquarters are located high up in the Nakatomi Plaza skyscraper which is still under construction. In this office there is a vault. In this vault there are bearer bonds worth $640 million. Enter Hans Gruber. He and his heavily-armed goons storm the building, take everybody hostage and set in motion their plan to open that vault and get that money. Only one thing stands in their way: John McClane.McClane is conveniently the only person in the building who manages to escape being taken hostage. He then conveniently manages to stay alive as a whole swarm of well-trained, heavily-armed terrorists continually fires at him with machine guns and attempts to blow him to smithereens with powerful explosives. He makes quite the nuisance of himself, Hans is not pleased. Anyhow, there's a lot of shooting and a lot of things blowing up...and then there's a lot more shooting and a lot more things blowing up...and then...well, you get the picture. It's basically two hours of this on an endless loop. It's an action movie that indeed has lots of action but that action gets repetitive rather quickly. This movie is often described as innovative and revolutionary. That's overselling it by quite some distance. It's an average shoot-'em-up action movie. No more, no less.The best thing the movie has going for it is the talents of its two leads. Bruce Willis plays the hero, Alan Rickman plays the villain and if anything in this movie rises above the level of cliché it is their performances. Willis infuses McClane with some personality, delivering wisecracks which bring a smile to your face. Rickman makes Hans into a rather unique villain, a detestable guy to be sure but one with some serious intelligence and cunning. Unfortunately these two main characters spend very little time actually squaring off with one another, McLane spending the bulk of the movie dealing with a bunch of anonymous bad guys you really don't care about. Supporting characters offer very little support. Aside from McClane and Hans there's not much there. Reginald VelJohnson has a few good moments playing an LAPD officer who comes onto the scene. Unfortunately he is soon overshadowed by a deputy police chief character whose stupidity is just mind-boggling. Any momentum the movie threatens to gather comes to a screeching halt anytime this guy opens his mouth. Then some FBI guys show up and remarkably they're even worse. There's a lot of stupidity outside Nakatomi Plaza. And there aren't enough interesting things happening inside the building. Die Hard is a movie which is considered to be a standout in the action movie genre, a classic. The truth is it's a rather ordinary movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Action
"You'll ""Die Hard"" with this action-lover's action movie","One could claim that 1988's ""Die Hard"" is one of the most influential action movies ever made because it basically revolutionized one of the most copied (but never matched, at least in terms of quality) formulas: a loner, by some unique twist of fate, battles it out with an ""x"" number of terrorists in an enclosed environment.By the time that ""Die Hard"" was released, the action movies were most often dominated by the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, and Chuck Norris. Star Bruce Willis, whose only notable credits at the time were television's ""Moonlighting"" and 1987's ""Blind Date,"" which was released the year before, was the unlikeliest of them all.Willis was a wild card - an unlikely choice for the role of our hero ""John McClane"" - since he didn't have any action credits on his resume' and let's face it: Bruce Willis just didn't have the bulging biceps required for a role like this. But that's the beauty of his performance in this movie: he's an everyday guy, caught in a not-so-everyday situation.On Christmas, McClane's estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) invites him from New York all the way out to Los Angeles to spend the holidays with the family. But it requires him to make a stop at the Nakatomi offices, which is having an after-hours Christmas party. Riding for the first time in a limo, he's introduced to the suave driver, Argyle (De'voreaux White), who gives him some pretty useful advice on trying to win over the wife.At Nakatomi, things of course get off to a rough start for McClane, as he gets into an argument with the wife and is left to wallow in his misery. However, those problems are about to take a backseat to the real ""party"" - twelve terrorists, led by Hans Gruber (all-purpose bad guy Alan Rickman, perfectly cast) - seize control of the building and proceed to rob the Nakatomi building of its assets, most of which include negotiable bonds and other valuables. But they didn't count on the ""fly in the ointment"" (pain in the a**) to make things hell for these so-called party crashers.Certainly one of the best known action movies ever, ""Die Hard"" did receive the scorn of critics upon its 1988 summer release, but the audiences sung a completely different tune.The film was most often praised for the production, with the brand-new Fox Plaza office tower serving as the fictional Nakatomi building. It was also praised for the energetic and skillful direction of John McTiernan, whose most notable credit was the action-sci-fi thriller ""Predator,"" which was released the year before and starred Arnold Schwarzenegger.Bruce Willis was the perfect actor for this performance, since he brings the wit and vulnerability to a role like this one. If Stallone or Schwarzenegger were in this movie, I'm sure the effect would have been a lot different.Personally, I think ""Die Hard"" is one of the greatest action movies ever, up there close to my favorite action movie of all time, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Like Indiana Jones in that film, ""Die Hard"" had an Everyman cast in the role; McClane, like Indiana Jones, wasn't a larger-than-life musclebound grotesque: he was a real guy that you cared about, who got hurt, and had real feelings.That's why I think both of these movies have sort of stood the test of time as becoming what they are best known for today: action classics, and they're here to stay, ladies and gentlemen.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Action
"""Welcome to the party, pal!""","(In brief)
By any measure, ""Die Hard"" was a pretty muscular movie back in '88. It made cultural icons out of its two stars and the explosions were guaranteed crowd pleasers. The script (note-perfect) ran like clockwork with setup-and-payoff and was stocked with memorable characters throughout; the hero reluctant and vulnerable, his stakes ever ratcheting, while the action would just keep mounting until . . . Well, there wasn't any more opulent high-rise. It doesn't matter what time of year you watch this movie, it functions perfectly in July and December (or even today, so close to Halloween) and always his the spot. It's the ultimate ""You can't go wrong with"" movie.(Less brief)
After twenty minutes of story setup, BAM! The guns start blazing and the death toll gets going. At a certain point, this just becomes kind of a theme park ride as John McClane scrambles through the bowels of Nakatomi Plaza and everything's raining down around him.McClane is the key to making all of this work after all. He's the ideal rally-behind character, neither hulking nor shredded and always thrust into a fight; and Bruce Willis is working at peak likability. But he's matched by Alan Rickman, the master scene-stealer, as devilish as they come. It's a rivalry commensurate with such a big movie.And McTiernan's the perfect director for this gig. His direction is self-assured, his camera calm and measured. Sure, we're confined to this building the whole time, but the audience had plenty of moments to take a breath and soak it in. Put it this way: can you imagine someone like J. J. Abrams helming this? Stock up on Dramamine first.I can go on and on, but the bottom line is this: ""Die Hard"" is just *fun*. There's joy in the gunfire, personal injury and wanton property destruction. I always feel great after watching this.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
The ultimate action film.,"Die Hard tells the story of a New York City detective named John McClane who is separated from his wife. She invites him to a Christmas party at her office building in Los Angeles, and he decides to go to work things out. Once there, a group of German terrorists come in and take hostages with the intent of stealing millions of dollars in bonds. McClane manages to escape and begins to fight the terrorists one by one to save the people in the building.Die Hard is a classic film because it completely revolutionized action films. The 80s were a time of unrealistic action sequences, predictable characters, and rudimentary plots. Die Hard changed all that. Die Hard takes place in a real world setting, or at least about as real as you can get with an action movie, so the action sequences, while insane, are slightly believable. The plot of the movie is simple, yet it's so brilliant at the same time. And the characters in this movie are engaging and a lot of fun to watch. John McClane is a really likable everyman kind of guy, we can all relate to him. Hans Gruber is an awesome villain, both cold and ruthless, yet very human. The supporting characters on the outside of the building are all great as well. Another great thing about Die Hard is that even though it's a hardcore action movie, it manages to be extremely funny at some parts, almost to a point of being able to call it a comedy. This makes the movie really easy to watch over and over again. There's really nothing wrong with this movie whatsoever in any department.The acting is great. Bruce Willis is hilarious and hardcore as John McClane, and he portrays the adrenaline and the frustration of the situation very well. Alan Rickman is awesome in one of his earlier roles as the main villain Hans Gruber. Reginald VelJohnson is enjoyable as McClane's outside contact Officer Al Powell, and Paul Gleason is funny as a hardheaded and incompetent deputy chief of police.Overall, Die Hard is the ultimate action film because it's fast, funny, and hardcore. It also gave us one of the most famous action movie one liners of all time...You know the one.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Action
"Ladies and gentleman, Mr.Bruce Willis, Movie Star","DIE HARD (1988) **** Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, Bonnie Bedelia, Alexander Godunov, Reginald Vel Johnson, William Atherton, Paul Gleason, Hart Bochner, Robert Davi.  NYC cop John McClane (Willis in his star-making iconic role) is visiting LA at Christmas to reconnect with his estranged wife Bedelia who is at an office party that becomes a nightmare when a group of terrorists take over the building led by Hans Gruber (perfect Rickman) a German nutjob out to filch millions in bonds in the vault of the Japanese company.  As the "" fly in the ointment"", Willis does his damnedest to stop him at all costs relying on his street-smarts and out-guessing as time ticks away.  Great blend of action suspense and much welcomed humor.   Best bit: Willis plunging from a rooftop attack by the FBI (thinking the disheveled cop is one of the bad guys!) attached to a fire hose and shooting his way into an empty office!  Hair-raising and exhilirating fun for all. ""Yippiee-Kay-Ay !!!!"" (Dir: John McTiernan)",,Anonymous,Action

"Went to the theater 'thinking' ""This might be stupid.""","I was not a Bruce Willis fan per say. As a matter of fact, I thought what is this guy from Moonlighting gonna do? Is he gonna make them laugh to death with stupid comments and jokes?I was not a fan of ""Moonlighting"" then either, that would come later. In addition I was not thinking, 'John McClain' ""Hans Gruber' or 'John McTiernan' that was my first error.As I took in the very first minute of the film, I knew, this was going to be radically different than I had imagined.This movie and John McTiernan's directing (Also 'Preditor'-1987 'The Thomas Crown Affair'-1999) (The Hunt for red October) (Medicine Man)The way I felt from his genius directing style, that gets you fully involved, stomach wrapped in knots, pulse pounding. He brings out the whole story, not just a 'clot' of mindless action and or violence.He actually led up to the stories climax and didn't blow it when he got there. I was shocked at this movie, which gets 'compared to' all the time with other action and drama movies! Still, after two decades.Needless to say, it changed the way I felt about movies and film making. From Willis's flawless performance to master terrorist Hans Gruber, (Rickman) what a truly superb 'Villain' & (James Shigeta, Holly's Boss) the emotion and heart-thumping fear that lead up to the demise of James's character. The scenery of the towering building and the city itself after dark, under the threat of terrorist activity.Don't forget L.A. P.D.-in charge 'DeWayne T. Robinson', (Paul Gleason - God rest his soul -Died May 26, 2006)I truly looked at film with a whole different view point. I got a copy of the original script, well the 18th re-write or something like that and went, line by line, through the story. It was unbelievable how this movie changed my mind on Movies...as well as Bruce Willis. I just can't say enough about Die-hard, but I will come to a soft close...but before I do, here is a 'spanner' of a thought, originally Willis was not first choice, it was Stallone that they wanted and he turned it down, think on that one! This would not be what it is this way, it would be wholly different with 'Sly' at the helm. I will even venture further out, do you know who this was originally written for? -Answer: Burt Reynolds.

Christmas hijackers.,"Casting about in December for an alternative Christmas film to watch, to my surprise, saw this at number two in a magazine-list of the 50 greatest Festive films ever. Mind you quote what the body-count here contributes to the season of goodwill to all men is open to interpretation. Still, for thrills, stunts and spectacle ""Die Hard"" certainly delivers, less so for characterisation, plot and credibility, although I suppose it was ever thus for action blockbusters like this. Bruce Wilis advances into the heavyweight corner with his performance here, even if his wise-cracking persona seems to have carried over from ""Moonlighting"", although where he picked up his pliability and durability along the way, again is anybody's guess. I liked Willis in ""Moonlighting"" so it's not surprising I like him here. His John McClane is capable it seems of startling feats of death-defying derring-do, but at least he gets there from an inauspicious start when he initially seems terrified and clueless as to how to cope with the heist situation. He squares off well against smooth, metronomic, but sadistic Alan Rickman, in his first big movie role, as the robber's leader proves a good foil. The stunts are excellent, although the soundtrack and fashions have dated poorly. Nevertheless, the action steams ahead from almost the start and rarely lets up thereafter, Bruce working his way through what looks like a bunch of try-outs for 80's hairbands. At various points I picked up on Christmas in the background, even if the film as a whole has little to do with the traditional festive spirit . Still, I watched it all the way through and even though I'm more a Jimmy Stewart /Cary Grant man around this time of year, I can see how it came to define a whole sub-genre of 80's blockbuster.",6.0,Anonymous,Action

A humanized action hero.,"This film began a remarkable action movie franchise that runs around the detective John McClane of the New York Police Department. In this film, he will try to save the life of a group of hostages held captive in a corporate skyscraper of Los Angeles. Directed by John McTiernan, the film has a script of Jeb Stuart and Steven E. de Souza. Bruce Willis embodies the leading role. The film was nominated for four Oscars (Best Sound, Best Editing, Best Sound Effects, Best Visual Effects).At first glance, this film does not look like anything special. Another eighties action movie, full of explosions, police cars made in pieces and bloodthirsty killers facing a single man, full of noble intentions. However, this film has something different: in a decade full of bullet proof heroes, this hero does not act (or looks) as something indestructible. He hurts himself, complains all the time and looks like a guy facing a situation beyond his control. So, its not difficult for the public to chear McClane, making Willis great performance the big advantage of the film.Everything else followed, more or less, the pattern of the decade for action: stunning sets, special, visual and sound effects made with great care and regular performances from the rest of the cast (the interpretation of Alan Rickman, then still little known by non- British public, deserves a positive note of attention). This is an action film that captivates some audiences more adverse to this kind of movies, which proved to be the key to its success.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
"Innovative on one level, tired on many others.","The word ""innovation"" is thrown around frequently concerning this film. This word is indeed apt, but on very specific grounds. Credit must be given to how the action hero's personality is treated here. In 1988 the summer blockbuster action hero's demeanor as dead-serious stud was near-universally accepted as the only way to do it. Here we have Bruce tear down the archetype by playing it anything but serious, and letting the viewer know it. A unique delivery given the genre, and I suppose Willis deserves almost all the credit. But when considering that an actor's delivery is usually a minute percentage of a film's makeup this movie falls flat.Consider: Common-man hero minding his own business is thrown into an oppressive situation. Reacts to oppression with a fountain of wisecracks. Proves that a lone righteous vigilante is far more effective than the combined efforts of the rest of law enforcement itself (represented here by the FBI, played by ugly actors). A seemingly irreconcilable personal relationship that is solved merely by our hero's courage (""Only John could irritate someone that much""). The obligatory--- one more villain crash the victory parade only to be shot by secondary hero--- bit. Lots of guns. Lots of big fireballs. Lots of money. Lots of punching. The list of tired movie clichés goes on and on. Not much original here.And though the hero's personality is celebrated, it ultimately comes down to the tried and true notion that his ability to kick ass is his most important attribute. Like any action blockbuster, we leave the theater having learned nothing from our hero, experiencing no profound admiration for him, but merely acquiring a desire to kick as much ass. A kind of hero envy. Not unlike how ""Over the Top"" left us with the desire to enter an arm-wrestling competition. It seems that that quality is indeed all that matters. (The deaths of innocent civilians and FBI agents alike are ignored during the finale's party-down celebration.) All's well that ends well for the stud. The filmmakers here even show us how to channel our newfound heroic inspiration by showing the everyday wife punch out a journalist at the end.So while this film may have re-invigorated the genre (not re-invented) it certainly did not do so in a particularly healthy way.",5.0,Anonymous,Action
Wham Bam Action Classic,"Die Hard (1988)*** (out of 4)Enjoyable and tense thriller about a group of terrorists (led by Alan Rickman) who overtake a L.A. skyscraper and the only thing keeping them from getting away with their crime is a New York police officer (Bruce Willis) there on vacation. There's a lot of very good things about this movie but I've always thought that the majority of the credit has to go to star Willis. He might not have been a A-list star at the time this was released but it's easy to see why he became one afterwards. I think what's so great about him and the character he plays is that we can believe he's just your typical guy you'd see walking around on the streets with you. That every-day-man quality that Willis has works so well here because of the odds stacked against his character you can't help but just sit back and enjoy this one person taking out a professional organization. The hilarious one-liners, the smart remarks and the way Willis makes himself know to the terrorists is just classic and we get so many great showdowns that you can't help enjoy all of them. It certainly doesn't hurt that you've got a strong supporting cast with Rickman being a villain you just love to hate. The coldness RIckman brings to the part is the perfect contrast to Willis' cop and it works perfectly. Reginald VelJohnson, William Atherton, Bonnie Bedelia and Paul Gleason also add great support for Willis to play off of. The action scenes are certainly some of the best you're going to see and what holds them together so well is the direction by John McTiernan. He perfectly blends the humor, tension and the action but he also gives the film a wonderful pace that keeps it moving at a fast rate. DIE HARD might be far-fetched in what one man is able to do but this really doesn't take away from any of the fun.",,Anonymous,Action
"""Die Hard""-  Quite simply the greatest action-adventure film ever made.","It's almost unfathomable that in just one year's time, the original entry in the ""Die Hard"" saga will be thirty years old. And yet, even then, it will still remain in its position as indisputably the greatest action-adventure ever committed to the screen. In every way remarkable, entertaining and breathlessly exhilarating, it is the quintessential gold-standard when it comes to action. A masterpiece of filmmaking, ""Die Hard"" took the world by storm in 1988 and even with inconsistent quality in sequels, it still enthralls and entertains thanks to sharp writing, perfect casting, exquisite performances and top-notch direction. It's hard to imagine that anything will ever top it.Bruce Willis stars as Detective John McClane, a New York cop who flies out to Los Angeles to spend Christmas with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) and children. Arriving at a massive Christmas Party at Holly's workplace in Nakatomi Plaza, things start to seem like they might be looking up for John... until a group of terrorists, lead by the vile Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) seize control of the building, hoping to get their hands on over half a billion dollars in bearer bonds that are locked away in the vault. Escaping the threat and discovering that the police will be completely unable to help, John realizes he must work alone, eluding capture and taking out terrorists one by one if he is to save the day...Directed by John McTiernan from a script by Jeb Stuart and Steve E. de Souza, the film as just exquisitely assembled. McTiernan's keen eye for visuals and perfect sense of pacing and composition allow the tension and excitement to build with virtually every second as the story progresses and the stakes rise. But he also knows when to pull back and give the characters breathing room to develop and just talk with one another, without rushing through it or over-relying on broad archetypes as many more modern filmmakers do. Absolutely amazing direction. The screenplay (inspired loosely by the Roderick Thorp novel ""Nothing Lasts Forever"") is exceptionally well put- together. de Souza and Stuart craft an instantly identifiable and highly likable cast of characters- including villains you very much love to hate- that all get their proper moment to shine and all feel well-defined and developed. The structure of the film is also very sound, and they strike a perfect balance between story and action in a way few other films have.We are treated to one of the finest casts to ever populate a tale of adventure in the film. Much has already been said about Bruce Willis and his iconic turn in the role of McClane, but it is still not enough. Bruce Willis just might be the ideal action hero. He's tough, but not unstoppable. Smart, but not a genius. And sharp- witted, but with a certain sense of vulnerability. In many ways, he's the sort-of person anyone and everyone can identify with, and that's what makes McClane such an incredible hero. Alan Rickman- in his first starring role- absolutely steals the show as the villainous Hans, a presence who will charm you, even while you root for him to go down. Rickman is a talent that was taken too soon after his tragic passing last year, and it's roles like this that prove just how great a loss it was. Supporting roles by the likes of Bedelia and William Atherton are exceptional for the material. And Reginald VelJohnson is just magical as Sgt. Al Powell, a cop who offers support to McClane over the radio throughout the film's runtime.Beyond the cast, the direction and the writing is just simply a phenomenal overall production. Cinematographer Jan de Bont, who would later go on to become a director in his own right, paints a beautiful cinematic image, with outstanding work done, particularly in the lighting and color. Composer Michael Kamen's score is just a blast of pure fun. With a sort-of old-fashioned scope yet a modern flair, the music constantly and consistently compliments the images on-screen perfectly, and it's such a relief that his themes were used in each subsequent film. And editors Frank J. Urioste and John F. Link expertly manipulate the footage so that every shot... every emotion... everything is in service to the story and characters. Now THIS is how you film and cut an action film!In the end, ""Die Hard"" may soon be turning thirty years old, but it remains as exciting, engaging and enthralling as ever. Upon initial release, it became the perfect example of an adventure done right, and blew audiences away. And it continues to do that now. I honestly have my doubts that anything will ever be able to beat it in terms of quality in storytelling and execution of action. It simple is the best action movie ever made. And for that, it easily earns a perfect 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Action

The Greatest Action Film Of All Time,"It's very rare to come across an action movie that doesn't use the formula that die hard created or to come across an action movie that's as good as die hard. I'd like to thank director John McTiernan and screenwriters Jeb Stuart and Steven E de Souza for giving us the perfect 80's action film. Die hard is based on a novel called ""Nothing Lasts Forever"" by Roderick Thorp.Bruce Willis plays John McClane a new York cop going to Los Angeles for Christmas to see his wife, Holly. During a Christmas party at the nakatomi plaza, a group of German terrorists led by Hans Gruber played by Alan Rickman take hostages and McClane is the only one that can stop them.The performances in this movie are great. Bruce Willis as John McClane is perfect. He is a very believable police officer. Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber steals every scene he's in. He is one of, if not the greatest action movie villain of all time. Holly Gennaro McClane is played by Bonnie Bedelia and she's very good in the film. Reginald VelJohnson plays Sgt. AL Powell, an LAPD officer who communicates with McClane through the use of a radio. He's great character with a great ark. Paul Gleason is Deputy Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson and he's quite good as well. William Atherton plays a news reporter named Richard Thornburg who's a total tool. Hart Bochner plays Ellis. He's great in the movie. James Shigeta is Mr Takagi the owner of the nakatomi plaza. Karl is played by Alexander Godunov, who's very good. The limo driver named Argyle is played by De'voreaux White. He's a great supporting character.This movie is perfect in every way possible, the acting, the directing, the amazing action, the cinematography by Jan de Bont, the dialogue, the setting, the editing, and the soundtrack are all perfect.

Iconic action classic,"Is there anyone out there who hasn't seen Die Hard? It's an American staple in the universally loved genre of action movies, so unless you really don't like them, you've probably seen it. I'll tell you a secret: I fell asleep the first time I watched it. Thanks to the magical DVD player and the boxed set of Die Hard DVDs my dad bought, there've been ample opportunities to rectify my mistake and watch the movie again.In this Bruce Willis classic, action, tense drama, comedic one-liners, and Christmas are all mixed together to make a winning combination. Walking barefoot on broken glass might not be the type of scene you want to watch him in during the holidays, but Die Hard has been added to many people's Christmas movie traditions. He plays the iconic policeman John McLane-with an iconic catchphrase that isn't appropriate to write out or say in front of children-who, on Christmas Eve, winds up fighting the scary Alan Rickman, a German terrorist who takes a building full of people hostage, instead of reconciling with his wife, which was his original plan for the evening.Sometimes the old action flicks wind up becoming cheesy over time. While I'm not one to call 1988 an ancient time, this movie has had time to settle, and even among the young, impatient audiences of today, it's still enjoyed and entertaining. When James Shigeta says, ""You'll just have to kill me,"" he's not saying anything new; hostages have always whimpered to villains that they don't have the needed information, and the villains always shrug and let them live. In Die Hard, Alan Rickman shrugs and follows James's suggestion. It's iconic, funny, terrible, and makes Alan both a wonderful and frightening villain. Get ready to start quoting both the hero and the villain, and you're guaranteed to have a ""yippe ki-yay"" of a good time.",7.0,Anonymous,Action

A film of its age and genre,"Watching seminar 1980s action movie 'Die Hard' for the first time 35 years after it was originally released, you more or less get what you'd expect. Namely, big hair, lightly racist tropes played for comedy, unexpectedly causal smoking, sympathy for a muscled-up Bruce Willis playing a man afflicted by the fact that his wife is good at her job, a vague sense of unease around Japanese corporate ascendency, and a plot line whose implicit message is that there's nothing worse than a bureaucrat. The movie even ends with a frankly disgusting twist, in which a cop who'd killed a kid regains the courage needed to fire his gun again and this is presented as a happy ending for one and all. Either you like this kind of thing, or you don't. In its favour, it has Alan Rickman as a smooth villain (arguably his most famous, although hardly his most demanding, role); and some of the action scenes (those in the lift, and when Willis jumps off the roof) are pretty cool. But if I have to wait another 35 years before re-watching, I think I'll survive.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
A Headache,"How this movie enters into IMDB's top 250 is beyond me.  This film is not a well-crafted work of art, but a dull, banal, predictable action blockbuster.Bruce Willis plays John McClane, a cop who's arrived at his wife's company's party.  He escapes unnoticed when a terrorist leader (Alan Rickman) and his lackeys take the party hostage.  They are after the company's money, and won't be leaving until they get it. Well, surprise, surprise, but a certain cop decides to be the hero and stop them.  And this is no ordinary cop  he seems to be able to dodge bullets (think of the `miracle' scene in Pulp Fiction, many times over).Our so-called good-guy also kills ruthlessly, whilst our bad-guys seem to be very merciful.  The amount of times they have McClane at gunpoint and let him escape is unbelievable.  By the end you get the feeling that Brucey's character is very much invincible.The one good point of the movie is Alan Rickman.  He is an excellent actor, and his character is the one likeable one in the entire movie.  Bruce Willis, who is usually excellent, is disappointing as all he manages to do well is shoot a gun and not die.  The rest of the acting is fairly forgettable action movie acting, but that is acceptable in a movie of this time, whose purpose is to excite and not to make the viewer think.Obviously if you are thinking of seeing this movie you won't be looking for a deep and meaningful picture, but you'll be looking for a thrill-packed experience.  Die Hard will not give you this; it will most likely give you a headache (if my opinion is anything to go by).  If you want to see an exciting action movie about hostages in a tower, forget Die Hard, and go and see The Negotiator (8/10).I give Die Hard 3/10.",3.0,Anonymous,Action

A Genre Defining Film,"In the 1980s, a unique trend developed in American Cinema. It became popular for one man to go against a larger superior force and emerge triumphant. Die Hard if not the progenitor of this genre, it most certainly stands as the prototype. It helped to establish what is possible for the emerging action genre when done right.This film also established the career of Bruce Willis. At the time, he was considered a major risk. He had not had any significant ""breaks"" into film and had an average television career. Through his performance he became a household name and would be propelled into stardom. Mr. Willis was able to capture the ""everyman"" struggling through his life and never giving up.Die Hard also introduced to the world the character actor, Alan Rickman. An actor whose speaking voice comes across solemn and droll. His voice was perfect for conveying the arrogance of Hans Gruber, the film's antagonist. He also has a chance to put his voice talents to use as he is required to use two different accents for the role.The film follows a New York policeman, John McClain (Bruce Willis) who finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time when a group of German terrorists led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) take control of a skyscraper. The film does a good job of balancing action with McClain's physical and emotional suffering.

A very overrated action film.,"This movie is on this sites top 250 but I can't figure out why so many people like it. The problem simply is that John McClane makes one stupid decision after another.SPOILERS AHEADThe scene where Tony is looking for John and is obviously going to kill him with that submachine of his is the best example.John sneaks up behind Tony and presses his semi-auto against his head, then pistol whips and then fight him with his bare hands, instead of forcing him to relinquish the gun first. Tony then tries to shoot John. Any averagely smart cop would have shot Tony.Another example is the scene where John was trying to signal the cop, Al by breaking the window with the chair. A gunman comes into the room, but John is ready for him. With his pistol raised he tells the gunman to put his gun down. John has no back up or assistance to take restrain the guy so attempting to force the guy to surrender wouldn't be wise. Another gunman enters the room just after that, and because John chose not to shoot the first one who entered, that makes things a lot more challenging.And the third is, in the scene where John meets Hans, face to face for the first time. Hans is unarmed, and John has a gun pointed at him. They both hear the elevator arrive at the floor they're on, which of course means more henchmen are coming. For some reason John doesn't shoot Hans as the elevator doors begin to open. He shoots at the henchmen just as they are coming out out of elevator and runs. The mistake there was leaving Hans alive. I know the filmmakers wouldn't want the hero killing of the main villain early, but couldn't the writers come up with a scenario in which the hero couldn't kill the villain early? Couldn't they write a script that makes sense of the characters?The lieutenant who kept arguing with Al, never followed logic either. There was no reason why he would have any doubt that there are terrorist in the building. If he is that dumb then why is he that high promoted?",4.0,Anonymous,Action

A guy movie that is still fun to watch,"So many things made this movie great.This movie made Bruce Willis immortal. He soaks up this character so well, it was him. The wise cracking cop who is entertaining because he is sarcastically funny not uttering stupid catch phrases. He is a cop who looks like a normal guy, middle age, loosing some hair with wife problems. (no faked up pretty face with shaved chest and oiled muscles). He is cool without pretending to be cool.

He stumbles, gets stuck and survives only by last minute thinking. It has plenty of action without getting ridiculous.And the bad guys are great, smart sinister and well acted.It is one of those movies that could play every weekend and would still be watched.

"""Welcome to the party, pal.""","First of all, it is a Christmas movie. Ok, that is out of the way. I wouldn't change anything in this movie. The storytelling, the music, the villains, the complaints about California through the eyes of a NYC cop, the camera work, the cast.. I love it all. This movie has been dissected by many of why it works, and all I can say is that it's a must watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
One of the Best,"""Die Hard"" is simply put one of the very best action movies that's ever been committed to film. Absolutely everything about the movie is perfect, or very close to it. Starting with Bruce Willis as the star, who finds himself caught up, totally unprepared, in a ""terrorist"" situation where a Japanese corporation's L.A. office building is taken over by heavily armed, highly trained German terrorists (or mercenaries, or maybe just thieves.)Alan Rickman is an incredible villain in this who steals every scene he's in.The best part about this movie is that it is much more believable and realistic than other action movies. He's a flawed cop, barefoot, and he actually makes mistakes and gets very badly hurt. The good guys aren't perfect. It's largely luck as well as his own toughness and ingenuity that get him through each gunfight, and his need to get his wife (who works for the corporation) back from the bad guys.Incredible story, pitch perfect acting, lots of great comic relief moments (the dad from Family Matters is in it!), fantastic action sequences. This movie is a must see for action lovers!",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Yippee-ki-yay,"Bruce Willis gives a amazing performance in perhaps one of the best movies of the 1980s. This is an action/adventure movie for the ages.

Now I have a machine gun...Ho Ho Ho!,"On Christmas eve, John McClane(Bruce Willis) is over at his wife's office party when hi-tech thieves break into said building and look to steal millions of dollars. While collecting hostages in the process, however there is one man who saves the day and it's McClane in what is one of the greatest action movies ever made. I must admit that i'm shocked it took so long to for me to review this. Over the years this has been in my DVD collection, I try to watch it on TV every time it's on and most of all I think it's there with The Terminator,Hunt For Red October and Rocky as the ultimate genre film. The real reason why Die Hard is so great is due to the suspense factor. Sure the action sequences are brilliant and very exciting but what really earns the high marks is just how suspenseful the movie is, it's one of those movies where the hero actually does the most logical things. Unlike the sequels per say, Willis uses the element of surprise and cunning to fight off the bad guys. Unlike the sequels where he was far more one man army. As it stands I remember seeing Die Hard in theaters and remembering being very skeptical of Willis (He was on that show with Cybil Shepherd) but knew right away after watching Die Hard, that Willis would be a great. However as it stands, this movie is a classic. On the other hand it's also a rare instance where one might want to buy a special edition DVD for the extras. Also of note is Alan Rickman who is one of the greatest bad guys ever.* * * * out of 4-(Excellent, A Must See)",10.0,Anonymous,Action
High-octane fun,"Entertainment that is pure Hollywood, with its impossible action sequences and cheesy tag lines.

Action-packed thrill ride that could be the best in the genre!!!,"Quite possibly the best modern action movie since the classic ""Dirty Harry"", ""Die Hard"" simply rocks. Based on the interesting novel ""Nothing Lasts Forever"" by Roderick Thorp, ""Die Hard"" made headlines for its combination of a terrific cast, excellent script, amazing action sequences and superb direction.  Headed up by screen favorite Bruce Willis (The Sixth Sense), ""Die Hard"" also features the talented Alan Rickman (Galaxy Quest) and Bonnie Bedelia (Needful Things).  Directed by action veteran John McTiernan, the mastermind behind such action spectaculars as ""Predator"", ""The Hunt For Red October"", ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" (1999), and ""Die Hard With A Vengeance"".In the role that shot him to stardom, Willis plays Detective John McClane, a hard-hitting cop from New York on Christmas Vacation in LA.  He is there to visit his wife (whom he is separated from), Holly Gennaro, who recently got a great job working for the Nakatomi corporation and has permanently moved to Los Angeles with their two children.  John arrives at Nakatomi Plaza expecting a fun Christmas party and a relaxing night.  Man was he wrong!  A few minutes after getting settled, twelve gun-toting Eastern Europeans take the entire 30th floor hostage.  The supposed terrorists are headed up by the brilliant megalomaniac Hans Gruber (Rickman), who actually wants the $640 million dollars inside the floor's vault.  Somehow, McClane escapes upstairs armed only with a handgun and starts causing a ruckus, slowly hunting down each well-equipped thug.""Die Hard"" succeeds is because it presents every challenge McClane has to face realistically and clearly.  As the tension mounts, the ordeals for John become increasingly harder.  First, it's just a terrorist.  Then a whole slew of them.  Later, it's the NYPD and even the FBI!  Director McTiernan gives the film a good pace and makes the film work by showing that John isn't superhuman; he only uses his brain more than his gun.  Also, screenwriters Jeb Stuart (The Fugitive) & Steven E. De Souza (48 Hrs.) add touches of humor that lighten up the viewer and classic one-liners (""Yippy-Ki-Yay, !@#$"") that ignite the screen.  Their subplots actually add to the story instead of overcomplicating it, especially one featuring good cop Sgt. Al Powell (Rejinald VelJohnson of TV's ""Family Matters"").Overall, this movie was awesome.  Willis is very believable and has significant screen presence.  Character development is superb, and even though Stuart and De Souza leave some loose ends untied - like how  a man gets hung with a chain and still comes back for more - the film remains to be an action classic.  Note to Parents: the nudity, drug use, continual profanity, and extreme violence would make this a bad choice for kids under 13.  Otherwise, see ""Die Hard"" ASAP! Overall Rating:   *** Worth 9 out of 10 dollars ***",9.0,Anonymous,Action
The Best Action Movie Ever Made?,"There was a moment in an early scene of Die Hard when John McClane (Bruce Willis) is having an argument with his wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) in the executive washroom in Ellis's office. It's scripted so that the two of them end up talking over each other about what McClane's idea of their marriage is, and it's such an honest depiction of estranged spouses that I find myself forgetting what movie I'm watching when I get to that part.Granted, not everyone has a terrorist takeover of their office building to teach them not to take each other for granted, but it works here.That scene is one of the great things about Die Hard, not because it contributes anything to the action, but because it contributes everything to the characters. Most action films before and after this seem violence-driven, but this one manages to balance the humanity of its protagonist, and I can't even begin to measure how much of that balance comes from that one scene.I think the other thing that most defines the spirit of this movie is McClane's shoes. It's such an obvious contrivance, set up right from the beginning, but it's worked into the entire story so artfully that I have completely forgiven it every time I've seen the film. Of all the bad luck, to be caught in the middle of a terrorist attack and then have to chase the bad guys around a 40-story building, all without shoes.But, as McClane himself says, it's ""better than being caught with your pants down."" I know how much of the plot and the action hinges upon luck, timing, strong fingertips, and the Rube Goldberg machinery of the FBI-terrorist interplay, but I really don't care. I still get caught up in the nervous moments of this movie 18 years later. I still ache along with McClane as he pulls a three-inch piece of glass out of his foot in the emergency lighting in the bathroom. And I still root for him to get the bad guy, rescue his wife, save his marriage, and meet Al Powell even though I must have scene this movie 30 or 40 times already, and I know he's going to do it again the next time.This is a great film, and easily the best written and best executed action movie I have ever seen. But more to the point, and more importantly, it's a fun movie to watch, no matter how many times you see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Too cheesy for me,"This film is full of cheesy dialogue and cheesy one-liners. So many, in fact, that it makes it hard for me to take it even the least bit of seriously.
The characters are one-sided, and it feels like many of them are just present for a quick gag and/or comic relief.
The effects are well done, but the audio is sometimes lacking.
For example, our main character John McClane brings clear audio, with crisp dialog. Something that our antagonist does not.
In my opinion, this movie has not aged well and is significantly over-hyped.For me to increase my rating I think mainly two points need improvement:
* Less cheesy dialog and one-liners.
* Make the characters more interesting, perhaps with a greater story arc.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
"Pure Schmaltz, But Very Entertaining","This remains one of the modern-day ""classic"" movies that was so popular that is spun several sequels. It was just great entertainment value.The story was ludicrous: one man beating a group of terrorists with outrageous, almost-impossible feats - another ""Rambo"" mentality flick - but it worked. The action scenes are memorable; Bruce Willis is good as the macho hero and David Warner is excellent as the villain.Otherwise, the film is way too profane and too biased, as usual, against law enforcement showing the acting police chief and FBI agents to be arrogant, stupid and crude....just what Liberal Hollywood always does to anyone in authority.

Every single character is a walking cliche, complete with corny Bond villains, arrogant cops, witty black chauffeur and swooning love interest. Bruce Willis is uninteresting and arguably a little irritating while Alan Rickman simply deserves better than this awful writing. The amount of plot armour that Willis is given takes all the suspense out of the film and makes it a rather arduous experience.

"Gosh, Bruce Willis really could act, couldn't he?..","... and there was a big question mark there in 1988 because up until that time Willis had been only the thorn in Maddie Hayes' side in the TV show that unleashed him on the world, ""Moonlighting"", and tabloid headline fuel with all of his after hours exploits. John Goodman later said that he was just as drunk and disorderly as Willis was, but pre Roseanne nobody knew who the heck he was, so he was given a pass. But I digress.On Christmas Eve NYPD cop John McClane(Bruce Willis) is in LA to visit his estranged wife (Bonnie Bedelia) at her place of business as a company Christmas party is in progress. She wanted to chase a big career and a big promotion on the west coast with a Japanese company, and John wanted to stay in New York as a cop. That is about the extent of their disagreement, but it put 2000 miles between them. But while they are talking a bunch of terrorists break in. They are actually just thieves, but they are using a terrorism angle as a front for the theft. They don't count on one thing though - McClane. They don't see him so he slips away and spends the evening thwarting their plans. The bad guys spend their evening trying to kill McClane. Why don't they use his wife as leverage? They don't know Bedelia's character is his wife.At one point McClane triggers a fire alarm and a lone cop, Powell, is sent to investigate. That lone cop talks to McClane through a radio and tells McClane he shot a kid once on the job, and he doesn't think he is capable of using his gun even if he must. The radio-bound comradery between the two is very good, in between all of the action.This is very likely one of the very best action films ever made. It has non-stop thrills, human interest, great acting by Willis which I think surprised everybody, and lampoons the media by showing them as lapdogs that eat up the contrived terrorist drivel they are fed by the thieves/kidnappers. And Alan Rickman gives a delicious performance as the head terrorist that is only surpassed by his role in Robin Hood Prince of Thieves three years later.Try it, as most big hits that were first in a franchise, it is much better than any of its sequels primarily because nobody was expecting it to be such a megahit, thus it is somewhat humble in its presentation. And that always helps.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
"Die Hard's fresh take on action heroes, excellent directing and pacing, and explosive effects make it a near-perfect action film and one of the finest of the genre.","Die Hard revolutionized the action genre by rejecting the muscle-bound action tropes of its predecessors and introducing a relatable fast-talking hero masterfully portrayed by Bruce Willis. Willis' John McClane receives more sympathy from the audience because of his everyman quality. McClane seems like an ordinary guy caught up in an extraordinary situation and is doing whatever he can to save his wife and stop the bad guys. This more conventional character makes Die Hard much more engaging because most viewers can see themselves in the movie. Mix in John McTiernan's incredible directing, Alan Rickman's standard-setting villain, and sprinkle in some Christmas music and holiday cheer for extra flavor and you got yourself one of the greatest action movies in history and the best Christmas movie of all time (Don't fight me on it not being a Christmas movie, please.

dated,"Yes, this film might have raised the bar for action movies at the time, but it's become quite dated, & may I add, looks cheesy today.If you like your action films loud, obvious, & all american, this is for you. I think it's far from a classic (a word that is used too easily)& doesn't have the staying power of say the Wild Bunch, the Taking of Pelham 1,2,3, or the French Connection. These films, while being action films, had a sophisticated & mature feel, while at the same time weaving social commentary into their stories.Die Hard clearly plays to an audience (most in evidence with the cheesy one liners)The movie always seems to sense that there is an audience watching.Yes, it may have raised the bar for action movies, but it's also responsible for a slew of even more excessive, shallow & cheesy action movies that came after it. After a while it became a question of outdoing the last big action film, so that meant bigger explosions, louder, more violent.

"If you dont like this movie, there is something wrong with you","(NO SPOILERS, BECAUSE I'M COOL) This is my favorite film ever made and this film is a masterpiece. If you don't like this movie, that's fine, I was just joking in the title, but from my perspective, there is no reason to not like this film. The first thing I want to say about this legendary film is that there can be good 1st acts in films, but normally they are the worst part in the movie, which it is here, but in this film every act is consistently amazing and the second and 3rd act are only slightly better than the 1st one. Bruce Willis is a laughable action star, right? No, he is so cool and he seems like a genuine cop wondering how he got himself into this situation. Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber has an even better acting performance and if they got some random other guy who was popular, but just ok at acting, this film would not even be in my top 20, even with the great writing. It takes place on Christmas, and it is of course and argument whether it is a Christmas movie, personally, I think Die Hard 2 is a Christmas movie, but not Die Hard. Sorry, this review has been all over the place, I'm new to these, but the last thing I want to talk about is the humor, basically all of the humor is given to Bruce Willis, and I'm glad. I watched a 45 minute documentary on this movie, and the things he says in these movies are definitely things he would actually say in real life.

An influential action film blessed with great performances and state-of-the-art thrills.,"Exhilarating, thrill to-the-moment joyride that will have you cheering! Tough New York City cop, John McClane (Bruce Willis) travels to Los Angeles on an invitation by a powerful corporate leader to celebrate at a Christmas Eve Party, where McClane's estranged wife (Bonnie Bedella) is attending. This was supposed to be a peaceful, joyous occasion, but before McClane could reconcile with his wife,internationally based terrorists lead by Hans Gouber (Alan Rickman, in a terrific performance) and his assistant (the late Alexander Godunov in a fine supporting role) hijack the tall skyscraper. Several hostages are killed, and the police and FBI have been called in to negotiate.What follows is a non-stop spectacle of stunts, explosions, and amazing action cheorography. Hans Gouber has kept several of the patrons hostage, and he assumed only too much that he had tied all the loose ends. However, Gouber and his mercenaries have not counted on McClane to intervene on the action! The stakes are rising though...as McClane's wife is among one of several hostages captured at this moment.Don't count McClane out yet!DIE HARD is a one-of-kind action movie that has a breathtaking pace and offers plenty of wits between McClane and Gouber. Bruce Willis gives an excellent performance as McClane, the ordinary guy who has entered the wrong scenario at the right time. Alan Rickman made a terrifying villian, Hans Gouber. Bonnie Bedella was annoying but hysterical as a wiseacre ex-wife turned hostage. The direction by John McTieran (PREDATOR, THE LAST ACTION HERO) was not short of being superb and first class.DIE HARD is one action packed movie that offers thrills, excitement, and plenty of fast paced humor and wisecracks from Willis. The action is fast and furious, and the film pulls enough punches to keep the energy flowing! DIE HARD is simply one of the most cinematic action masterpieces ever. It is often a rarity to see such a white knuckle adventure that keeps you on the edge of the seat throughout the entire film. Bravo!RATING: ***1/2 out of ****.",,Anonymous,Action
The best bad-ass macho action movie of the 80's extravaganza my personal favorite action movie of all time,"What can I say about Die Hard that was already said: it is one man army type against a team of terrorists who took over the building on Christmas Eve in L.A. I love this movie to death it is consider as a Christmas movie. It is my personal favorite action film of all time, that is dear to my heart. I have seen this movie over 100 times. Some people put Die Hard 2 over this movie, some people put Die Hard: With a Vengeance over this movie, I will never put any of the sequels above this movie because it is perfect. Die Hard is and will always be my favorite it is the best one in the action movies. Bruce Willis fits perfectly the role of John McClane a New York Cop, it was his first action movie that made him in to an action star.Directed was by John McTiernan who directed Predator a year earlier, this movie is based on a novel Nothing Lasts Forever by Roderick Thorp. This movie suppose to be a sequel to Commando (1985) but Arnold Schwarzenegger declined the role thank god. Sylvester Stallone was consider it for the role and he declined. Richard Gere, Harrison Ford, Mel Gibson, Eastwood, Robert De Niro, Charles Bronson, Don Johnson, Richard Dean Anderson and Michael Madsen were considered, but declined the role of John McClane. Thank god Bruce Willis fit the role perfectlly.This is the first and only movie that is about one man army type fighting against a team of terrorists who took over the building and declared war. There was a bunch of movies that copyied Die Hard but no movie could nealed like Die Hard did. Under Siege with Steven Seagal was my childhood film, I loved Seagal's character but now as an adult and from my teen years Die Hard surpass Under Siege because Die Hard was one man army type, who was in situation that felt realistic. Imagine your in a building and suddenly you hear gun shots, people with automatic weapons shooting at people and takes everyone hostage. What will you do? In this situation was John McClane armed only whith his service revolver barefoot he runs upstairs and all telphones dosen't work. McClane is alone, he crawles down the elevator shafts and try's to find out more information about the group. The only communiactions is trough radio.A team of terrorist shuts down all exits and elvators so no one can go down or up. The leader of the group is Hans Gruber played by Alan Rickman it was actors first role. Hans Gruber is one of the best villians of all time. Ask anyone, or read anywhere they will all tell you that Hans Gruber is the best villiand and bad guy of all time. In actaully terrorists werent agenda for a political demands, they were planing a heist in a 30 floor to steal $640 million in bearer bonds hold in a building's vault and not let anyone go. I can't wrote detailes or I will get spoliers so I don't want any spoliers on my review. Sgt. Al Powell played by Reginald VelJohnson was my favorite characacter. I love how he defends McClane against his suprevisors. I love how McClane and Powell communicate eachother from cop to a cop on a radio I love that. I love Dwayne T. Robinson, the Deputy Chief of Police ""kick-ass!"" I love Paul Gleason who does everything by the book. He is sure McClane is one of the terrorists, I really do wish his character would had more to do. I love Diana James and Shelley Pogoda who are Dispatcher and Police supervisor when McClane calls them for help. Gail Wallens played by Mary Ellen Trainor I love her as news reporter.The movie has tones of action: McClane talks to him self when he is about to do something crazy. my favorite scene is McClane firing 15 rounds with his Beretta 92F on a terrorist under the table. McClane grabs the fire hose, ties it around his body jumps with the helicopter about to kill him. Then Gruber blows it a second after McLane jumps off the roof! It was an incredible explosion that totally takes out the helicopter. But McLane is falling down the side of the building and needs to get inside quickly this is the best scene in the movie my favorite. McClane clambing down the elevator shaft is really one the best scens in the movie. Two terrorist uses Rocket Launcher and destroy a SWAT van that was driving in the building practical effect real explosion realy action done for real. The same van was used later in RoboCop 2 just that movie was less successful. You have 3 explosions in the building all done practical and for real. 20th Century Fox with the 80's really nailed with action movies nowdays the 20th Century Fox does not make so good movies like Predator, Die Hard, Aliens and Speed I miss action movies like this. The fight sequence between McClane and Karl was great choregraphed well filmed and done for real.Great music score by Michael Kamen absolutelly love the music score. All the terrorists are great in this movie. Great lines: ""The man is hurting! He is alone, tired, and he hasn't seen diddly-squat from anybody down here.

Classic dumb action that defined a genre,"It's hard today to think of action movies and not remember 'Die Hard'. The movie changed the genre of cop action forever, and for most still remains unsurpassed within it.Tough NY cop John McClane goes to Los Angeles to visit his wife during Christmas in a try to reconcile with her. However, the building they are in is taken by terrorists, led by Hans Gruber, and it's up to McClane to stop them.It's hard not to enjoy this film. It doesn't lose much time, has great action scenes and the setting of it all happening in a building allows for very interesting confrontations and tactics from both sides. Add that to Bruce Willis' tough, charismatic and smart-mouthed performance and Alan Rickman's great debut role, and you have an enjoyable 2 hour action movie to go for.Yet, not all was good in here. It's hard to fault the main characters, true, but the opposite goes for the supporting ones. They are mostly too obnoxious, irritating or flat-out uninteresting, with the added insult of every other law-enforcing figure being made to look like an utter idiot in order to up McClane in our eyes (from the LAPD to the FBI, ESPECIALLY the FBI). The 'buddy cop' relationship was better than in most movies of its kind, thankfully, as the actor playing Al Powell was good too.Finally, comes the plot itself. This is why I call this a 'dumb action'. How many people can you find that like Die Hard just for it's plot? Few. And how many can you find that don't even remember it? Probably many. The 'twists' in the motivation of Hans Gruber are just idiotic (especially his real plan, which is so full of holes I fell from my chair laughing when it was revealed) and the plot overall is either overly simplistic in some points or just illogically stupid in order to make their characters (ESPECIALLY the FBI) 'work'. Such a lack of good plot also troubles multiple viewings of this film, as there is only so much straight action can do without a plot to back it up.Overall, it's a very fun movie to watch, and it's action sequences continue to resist the test of time. Just don't expect a deep and intelligent movie, and you will have a very enjoyable 2 hours.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Willis vs Rickman !!!!,"This is the first film of the hugely popular action film franchise. The story involves a New York cop named John Mcclane(Bruce Willis) who is coming to California to meet his estranged wife on Christmas Eve at her office. Mcclane comes off as a rugged American cop from the 20th century who can't tolerate the life and the youth of California nor is he very well versed in high culture and art.He is a down to earth fellow who is not pretentious and says what he thinks without much complication. As luck would have it, on that very day i.e. on the Christmas Eve,a gang of German terrorists decide to break into the building and take hostages led by the infamous Hans Gruber played by Alan Rickman. Gruber is suave,sharp and well educated, so pretty much like the opposite of Mcclane. Mcclane gives the terrorists the slip and thus begins one man's fight to outsmart a whole gang of terrorists and save the day.I know this is not the popular opinion, but I found this film very dull. It uses the clichéd story arc of a main character who has marriage problems and then by using unbelievable bravery in larger than life situations helps save the lives of people and again get into the good books of his wife. There are so many scenes which look unrealistic and cheesy. So many characters in this movie are downright idiots like the Deputy Police Commissioner, the FBI officials, Mcclane's Limo driver,etc. Some of the lines spoken by the Deputy Commissioner are almost laughably silly. I know action film scripts are supposed to have conveniences, but this film takes the benefit of too many of those. The ultimate encounter at the climax of the film ends with another silly set piece that only points to bad writing.However having said that the film has a few things going for it. Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman are extremely good in their roles. Willis completely commits himself to the role physically and successfully sells the desperation of Mcclane's character. Rickman marvelously plays an intelligent and intimidating villain who has the ability to match the wits of our hero at every step. Lastly among the positives it has to be admitted that some of the action scenes and effects were very well executed considering it was the eighties.But overall I found this to be an average action film and had it not been for Willis and Rickman, my rating would have been lower than 5/10. Some people will say that since I have watched so many films that have come after Die Hard which have used the plots and techniques used originally by Die Hard,I might not be able to appreciate the movie as much as I should, but I completely dismiss that thought. Seinfeld is a sitcom whose material has been used and reused in so many other sitcoms later, but when I still watch Seinfeld it looks and feels as witty and as sharp as ever. But unfortunately Die Hard doesn't pass that test. If this is the best out of all the films in the franchise, then sadly I have to bid farewell to John Mcclane as I am not interested in checking out the sequels anymore. Our paths won't converge again in the future.",5.0,Anonymous,Action
The most influential action film of the last half-century,"Die Hard had an unusual history before it even reached the screen.In the Sixties, author Roderick Thorp wrote a novel, The Detective, which was turned into a movie, starring Frank Sinatra in the title role of Joe Leland. A sequel, Nothing Lasts Forever, was written, in which Joe becomes trapped in the Claxxon Oil Corporation skyscraper after it is taken over by German terrorists and he has to rescue his daughter. Frank Sinatra was contractually allowed to consider (and pass) on making that sequel, an adaptation written by Jeb Stuart. Then Steven E. De Souza was brought on board and he turned the Nothing Lasts Forever screenplay into Die Hard. The skyscraper became Nakatomi, the daughter became the wife, Leland became John McClane and several other actors, including Richard Gere and Clint Eastwood turned down the role until it landed with Bruce Willis.To say that Die Hard sets new standards for action movies is like calling Bill Gates modestly wealthy. The movie was so innovative and groundbreaking that dozens of rip-offs followed - Passenger 57, Under Siege, Cliffhanger, Sudden Death, et al. Hostage/terrorist movies were all the rage in the early Nineties.Very few came close, because Die Hard had so many strong points, not least of which was Alan Rickman's cold performance, as Hans Gruber - also the name of the villain in Our Man Flint - the classically educated, smartly dressed terrorist leader. Gruber would have been well at home on Wall Street.His plan is to break into the vault on the 30th floor of the Nakatomi Plaza and take away $640million in negotiable bearer bonds. When he and his 12 European henchmen round up the office workers, who are enjoying a Christmas Eve party, one man slips away unnoticed. He is John McClane, a New York cop who has come to LA to settle down with his estranged wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia). The odds are against him. But that's just the way he likes it.In his battle to save his Holly, McClane is scorched, torched, beaten, and blown up. He jumps off the roof and falls through air ducts. He uncovers deception and double-crosses, and picks broken glass out of his bare feet. No help comes from the naive and incompetent police, who are unable to get inside, and even less so from the overconfident FBI.McClane is not a supercop. He is an ordinary guy, who doesn't want a fight. When he is shot, he bleeds, he hurts. All he has are his pants, his vest, his gun - which does not have infinite ammo. This is a realistic connection the audience can identify with and helps to project yourself into the movie. When you don't want to be in McClane's position, it makes for much excitement.John McTiernan, who's only previous mainstream movie was Predator, uses awesome photography and technical skills to give the film a truly polished and sophisticated look that has become his signature style - it was nominated for four technical Academy Awards. He also allows for enough time for decent character development with arcs for multiple side-characters, most of which comes between McClane and a cop (Reginald Veljohnson) he makes friends with on a CB radio.Die Hard manages to be exciting every single time. It's lost some of it's respect in recent years as action films, post-1999, had tried endlessly to imitate The Matrix and use digital effects in place of real stunts and worse so since 2010 with the endless, tiresome, mind-numbing over-abundance of comic book movies filled with impossible physics, which is a really big loss and signalled the beginning of the end of the true, tough guy action film.",10.0,Anonymous,Action

The Best Christmas Movie Ever Made,"Die Hard is not simply one of the best action films ever made, but one that is easily able to stand the test of time, and do so in style. Die Hard shines brilliantly with some clever set pieces, action sequences, fun dialogue, and some great performances. Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman are obviously the greatest standouts in this 80's classic. It's surprising to say that audiences at the time were not too thrilled with the idea of him as action hero, and against all odds, he delivered a more than well, not to mention iconic, performance that simply no one could ever come close to capturing the same charm. Alan Rickman at the time was practically unknown, and with him as Hans Gruber, it's certainly a job well done into his life of stardom. Some other great performances include Bonnie Bedelia as Holly, Reginald VelJohnson as Al, and De'voreaux white as the limo driver Argyle. The film is also fantastically shot, surprisingly well written (for the most part), and wonderfully coordinated. In the end, Die Hard is not only a legitimate classic with more than enough reasons to justify it, but a timeless one as well.

Greatest Action Film of All Time?,"John McClane (Bruce Willis), officer of the NYPD, tries to save wife Holly Gennaro and several others, taken hostage by German terrorist Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) during a Christmas party at the Nakatomi Plaza in Los Angeles.This was the debut of Alan Rickman, the film that cemented Bruce Willis' career as an action star, and possibly the greatest action of film of all time (or at the very least, the 1980s). While it could have become dated, it has not -- not in the slightest.As I write this (December 2013), there is a new ""Red Dawn"" where the Soviets were replaced with North Koreans.

Arguably the Greatest Action Film of All Time,"One of greatest action films ever produced, with a case to be made for the the absolute pinnacle. Everybody knows what's right with it -- self-contained setting, ever-escalating stakes, fantastic hero & villain, tons of interesting characters on all sides, SFX that hold up nearly 30 years later - - so here's just a couple things that might challenge its claim to #1 Action Film trophy: Too many unbelievably stupid characters challenge suspension of disbelief, and the 80s hair and fashion date it just a trifle. But even the former are good for a few laughs, and the latter is a very minor complaint.Otherwise, ""Die Hard"" is pretty much flawless. Bruce Willis, John McTiernan, Alan Rickman -- their finest hour (maybe you could make a case for Rickman's loftier work, but he's dead solid perfect here).

Why Die Hard Defined the Action Genre,"Review #2 of ""My Top Ten Favorite Movies"" ReviewsIn 1988, when Die Hard came out, my parents and a family friend went to see it in New York City in a big theater. The movie was so crowded, they all did not even get to sit together. (And I don't even think it was opening weekend!) Take that into consideration for how big a movie this was back then and still is.Die Hard is the best action movie, and probably my favorite movie, with a close second or tie with The Shawshank Redemption.Die Hard combines well-executed action scenes with cheesy but iconic one-liners and a great main character. As sarcastic, profane, and messed up John McClane is, you have to find yourself rooting for him.Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, and Bonnie Bedelia, Reginald Veljohnson, and many others will have their acting skills defined by this movie forever. After all, it definitely gave a career boost to some, although Willis already had a nice acting resume on his plate. Nevertheless, it redefined the whole genre.Action movies consist of a bunch of key elements that come together to form a coherent picture. (At least I hope it will be coherent, as some tend to fail at this process.) They combine action scenes (obviously), at least a couple one-liners, a car (there's always a car or some kind of vehicle), a villain, and usually an explosion or two. Or three. ;-) All of these elements and many more were all in Die Hard, and it kind of changed the genre for good. You will hear people say ""Oh, that movie is a Die Hard rip-off"", or ""That stunt was first made famous in Die Hard."" It's not that action movies didn't have these elements before Die Hard, it's just that Die Hard made them better and/or famous.Die Hard will keep you on the edge of your seat, and is an extremely well-done picture that doesn't lag or slow down at all. It eases into the action in such a way that it feels natural and not forced or unnecessary.HandHStudios Rating: 10/10",,Anonymous,Action
"Big, dumb, fun action flick with Bruce Willis and a skyscraper","RELEASED IN 1988 and directed by John McTiernan, ""Die Hard"" is the first of (currently) five installments in the Die Hard series. In this one New York cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) flies to Los Angeles to spend Christmas with his wife & kids. When McClane visits Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) at her company's Christmas party a group of radical criminals take control of the skyscraper. Alan Rickman plays the nefarious mastermind of the operation while Reginald VelJohnson plays a cop on the ground that befriends McClane via walkie talkie. Meanwhile Paul Gleason is on hand as an exasperating police chief.This franchise fills the bill if you're in the mood for big, dumb, fun action thrills. Don't get me wrong because a lot of work goes into making these kinds of films and it takes talent & genius to pull them off. I mean ""dumb"" in the sense that the focus is on unbelievable action rather than deeper themes beyond ""genuinely good people may be flawed, cocky and somewhat profane, but they're courageous and never give up in the face of evil.""The Die Hard flicks are the natural progeny of over-the-top films like 1977's ""The Gauntlet"" where the action scenes are so overdone they're cartoony, but entertaining. There's a thin line that filmmakers must tread with these kinds of blockbusters because they can easily fall into overKILL, like 2001's ""The Mummy Returns."" Thankfully, ""Die Hard"" evades that ditch because it's not too over-the-top and it offers entertaining protagonists & antagonists, amusing one-liners, worthy bits of character development and a compelling comic booky story.While all five Die Hard movies are of the same action expertise, I prefer the sequels because this one takes place almost entirely in and around a skyscraper. I favor the wider location scope of the others.THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 12 minutes and was shot entirely in Los Angeles.GRADE: B/B+",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Dies hard,"""Die Hard"" features Bruce Willis as John McClane, a police officer combatting a group of terrorists holding hostages in an LA office building. Willis makes a decent action hero as John McClane and injected a welcome humor into the role. Inevitably McClane gets into a number of conflicts with the terrorists. There are some notable action scenes and special effects, but a lot of the action is repetitive shoot-outs. This would be fine if there were more story developments, but the developments are few and far between.The most interesting developments in the film revolved around the twists Hans Gruber engineers to thwart the inept efforts of the police when they attempt to enter the office building. Alan Rickman's performance as the refined and calculating yet sarcastic Hans Gruber is the highlight of the film. Most of the supporting characters were either unremarkable or unnecessary, particularly the incompetent deputy chief of police. However, having ""Al"", the one savvy policeman who showed some character depth and genuine concern was touching. Overall I found ""Die Hard"" to be mostly tedious, contrary to the popular opinion of the film as a fast-paced thriller. The one strongly redeeming feature of the film was Alan Rickman's memorable performance as Hans Gruber.",5.0,Anonymous,Action
The Pinnacle of 80s Action Film,"This may be the epitome of 80s action film, Bruce Willis stars as John McClane opposite Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber and both of them are eating every scene up. John McClane is the sarcastic renegade cop opposite Hans Gruber, the super intelligent German terrorist and if you think this sounds cliché it's because it is, still I loved it.The film brilliantly manages to up the stakes and grow tension throughout as we slowly learn the true extent of the villains plan, as well as that I love the way we see all the fights and injuries gradually wearing down McClane. Now while you know my opinions on Rickman and Willis, what about the surrounding cast? I think that on the whole they're really good apart from Bonnie Bedelia, who in her defence isn't given much screen time, and the group of goons who are just there to fight Willis and feel more like obstacles than people, still does that take away from the film? No. My biggest issue with the film is the sub plot of a Limo Driver being stuck in the tower car park, we keep cutting back to him and he adds nothing to the film, if you removed him it would have zero impact. Apart from that I'm a big fan, none of the technical aspects are outstanding but that doesn't take away from the fact that this is easily one of my favourite action films of all time and one I hope to revisit every Christmas from now on.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
This is a gem and action genre gold,"Die Hard (1988) is a movie I recently rewatched on Amazon Prime and is also in my DVD collection. The storyline follows an NYPD officer visiting his wife in Los Angeles. Shortly into his wife's Christmas party at her new job the building is taken over and everyone is held hostage...except the officer who will try to find a way to alert the police, keep the hostages safe and thwart the people responsible for capturing the building.This movie is directed by John McTiernan (Predator) and stars Bruce Willis (Pulp Fiction), Alan Rickman (Sweeney Todd), Reginald VelJohnson (Ghostbusters), William Atherton (Ghostbusters), Bonnie Bedelia (Presumed Innocent) and Al Leong (Big Trouble in Little China).Every aspect of this movie is better than it should be. The cast for the good guys, bad guys and everyone in between is perfect and so is their chemistry with every interaction. The writing is excellent from the dialogue, character backstories, circumstances and husband/wife dynamic. Willis obviously knocks this performance out of the park with his one liners and sarcasm, but Rickman is a marvelous villain as well. The action scenes are action movie gold and the comedic content in this is underrated.Overall this is a gem and action genre gold. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
"FABULOUS! All the action, thrills, suspense and dark humor that a person can handle without falling out of their seat!","Until I saw Die Hard I heard rumors about it. ""magnificent"", ""best action movie ever"", ""unmissable"", ""often copied, never bettered"". And the weirdest thing was that I didn't believe those quotes. So, I rented it on video a few years prior, watched it, kicked myself, and watched it as many times as I could because I couldn't get enough of it!! Die Hard is one of the most eye popping action movies ever made in cinematic history. I personally think this IS the greatest action movie out there on the video shelves! PLOT. It's Christmas Eve. A New York cop named John McClane has just arrived in California to meet up with his wife. His wife Holly has a great career working for the Nacatomi Plasa, a highly successful buisness. Tonight the Nacatomi Plasa is celebrating it's most successful year with most of it's workers attending. Soon after John arrives, terrorists seize control of the 40 story building! Now John must use all his wits, abillities, and knowlege to save the lives of all the hostages, including his wife. This is nearly as good as it gets as the movie progresses with hair rising stunts, explosions and gunfights. Bruce Willis is a very apealing action star, with all his dark humor-ed one liners and moves. Alan Rickman plays the head terrorist with a lot of style and devilishly great charisma. The two of them play off each other terrificly. Packed with plot twist after plot twist, eye popping explosion after eye popping gun fight, and over all 100% thrills make this action-er stand out among the list of good action movies. Okay, some of the stunts would seem un realistic. But movie lovers of all kind, LET GO. loose yourself in this movie about a man fighting an uphill battle, with the odds of winning stacked against him.

The Absolute Standard For Action Flicks,"One of my criteria for the best-of-the-best, top-shelf classic movies is that it is hard to imagine a world in which they did not exist. When it comes to ""Die Hard"", this film absolutely fits that description: a world without John McClane, Hans Gruber, and the Nakatomi Plaza seems utterly incomprehensible.For a very basic overview, ""Die Hard"" tells the story of John McClane (Bruce Willis), a New York cop invited to an LA business party by his wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia). The couple are estranged, creating an awkward dynamic, and things go from bad to worse when a group of international terrorists led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) choose that night to raid the vault in the building's basement. With the police presence continually bungling the situation, it is up to John McClane to single-handedly take charge of matters.In terms of action set pieces alone, ""Die Hard"" would still be considered one of the best of all-time. Jumps off skyscrapers, helicopter chases, epic gun battles, perfectly paced espionage...it's all here. Yet, what elevates the film to the stratosphere is both the characterization and acting present in the John McClane character.Essentially, McClane is a ""wrong place, wrong time, right person for the job"" sort of protagonist. Yet, not in the Rambo or Schwarzenneger mode whatsoever. No, John McClane is the ""everyman"" who just happens to be a cop that can think on his feet. His reactions and wisecracks--perfectly created by the writers and Willis' acting talent--portray this expertly. He is what all the viewers would want to be in a similar scenario, and just believeable/attainable to be infinitely engaging. From his engaging marital backstory to his ability to keep a cool head and crack wise even in the most dire situations, John McClane is truly one of the greatest characters ever put to celluloid.Of course, the auxiliary cast is almost as iconic. Bedelia is great as Holly, while Rickman's Gruber (from accent to mannerisms) is basically as culturally well-known as Willis' McClane now! Paul Gleason (aka ""the principal in The Breakfast Club) plays a cop you'll love to hate, Reginald VelJohnson is the cop you'll be rooting for, and even De'voreaux White's Argyle chips in with some tension-breaking humor. Every performance here has stood the test of time.Overall, I consider ""Die Hard"" to be one of the finest films ever made, largely due to the John McClane character. But even taken as a whole product, this movie will forever remain the standard by which all subsequent action romps are judged.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
An Unforgettable Action Thriller That Reshaped the Genre,"Die Hard, directed by John McTiernan, is an iconic action film that has withstood the test of time and continues to captivate audiences. Released in 1988, it introduced a new kind of hero and revitalized the genre. Bruce Willis delivers an outstanding performance as John McClane, a relatable and witty New York cop caught in a high-stakes hostage situation during a Christmas party at Nakatomi Plaza.The film's strength lies in its impeccable pacing and intense, pulse-pounding action sequences. The tension is palpable throughout, as McClane battles a group of highly trained terrorists led by the charismatic Hans Gruber, played brilliantly by Alan Rickman in his breakout role. The cat-and-mouse game between McClane and Gruber keeps viewers on the edge of their seats, as they outsmart and outmaneuver each other in a battle for survival.Die Hard excels in its ability to balance thrilling action with well-developed characters. McClane is a flawed but resilient protagonist, and the film's exploration of his vulnerabilities adds depth to his character. The supporting cast, including Bonnie Bedelia as McClane's estranged wife and Reginald VelJohnson as Sergeant Al Powell, provide strong performances that enhance the emotional core of the story.The film's exceptional writing, sharp dialogue, and witty one-liners contribute to its enduring appeal. Die Hard transcends the typical action movie tropes by injecting humor and humanity into its narrative. It seamlessly blends explosive set pieces with moments of genuine emotion, making it a well-rounded and engaging experience.With its innovative cinematography, gripping storytelling, and iconic moments, Die Hard remains a benchmark for the action genre. Its influence can be seen in countless subsequent films, and it has spawned a successful franchise. Die Hard is a must-watch for any fan of thrilling cinema, offering an unforgettable ride that stands as a testament to its enduring popularity.",7.0,Anonymous,Action

I beg to differ. Just because the story was set to take place during the Christmas holidays doesn't make it a Christmas movie, nor does ""Die Hard"" have the contents to be a Christmas movie in any way.

The Best Action Movie Of The 80s.,"The 80s Gave us many great action movies from The Terminator, Predator and The Road Warrior to Commando, Big Trouble in Little China and Escape From New York. But Die Hard in my opinion is the best of them all. The Main Character is great. He's relatable and likable and he's not a superhero, in fact he gets his butt kicked constantly throughout the movie. The Villain is also great. The Late Alan Rickman does a fantastic job playing this character. The action scenes are quite brutal and violent but very realistic. The humour is hilarious with some of the best one liners in cinema history. My only real problem with this movie is some of the supporting characters, mainly the police. Most of them are incredibly annoying and it gets so irritating when they constantly don't believe anything the main character is telling them about the terrorists. But even with that Die Hard is still my favorite action film of the 80s(And my favorite Christmas movie too).",9.0,Anonymous,Action
"One seized tower block, one sweaty vest and one big set of action cojones.","Based on ex cop Roderick Thorpe's 1979 novel Nothing Lasts Forever, Die Hard, directed by John McTiernan, changed the face of the action movie. Starring Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, Bonnie Bedelia, Reginald Veljohnson, Alexander Godunov, William Atherton & Paul Gleason, McTiernan's movie went on to make over $100 million in profit at the box office alone. Spawning three equally successful sequels (at the time of writing), it began a franchise that showed that if done well, the action movie could be a dominant force in the world of cinema.The set up is relatively simple, Willis plays New York cop John McLane who during the Christmas holidays is in L.A. to visit his estranged wife Holly (Bedelia). She works for the Japanese Corporation of Nakatomi, and currently she's attending the company Christmas party up on the 30th floor of the humongous Nakatomi Plaza tower block. Bad day at the office because a group of apparent German terrorists, led by the charismatic Hans Gruber (Rickman), take the whole building hostage: with one exception; McLane, who evades capture and launches a one man war against the terrorists.What follows is just over two hours of high octane action, smart dialogue and technical smarts. McTiernan had already endeared himself to the action movie fan with the ball busting beef stew that was Predator in 87, a fact not lost on Die Hard's co producer Joel Silver, who clearly knew that McTiernan could smoothly shift the action from the Val Verde jungle to the urban jungle of L.A. And he did. Next was to get the right man for McLane. Richard Gere was first choice but passed, so the makers took a gamble on Willis, whose career was at a standstill after his leap from TV show Moonlighting on to the big screen with the likes of Blind Date & Sunset barely making a ripple in Hollywood. The rest for Willis, as they say, is history. McLane is an everyman hero, streetwise, even slobbish, but identifiable to many with his work ethics, desperate heroics and emotional vulnerability. Willis attacks the role with a hunger rarely seen from the big male earners in filmdom. During the two hours and ten minute running time of Die Hard, Willis as McLane changed the face of the action hero for ever; even making a dirty white vest iconic in the process; the latter of which couples nicely with the hero being bare footed throughout for a nifty bit of writing.Across the board the casting is flawless, Bedelia is spunky and driven, a woman worth fighting for. Veljohnson as beat copper Al Powell-McLane's walkie-talkie buddy and only link to the outside world-is memorable because it feels real, he has his own issue gnawing away at him, but his exchanges with Willis keeps the humanity grounded as the carnage unfolds. Gleason & Atherton are wonderfully anal as Deputy Police Chief and TV Reporter respectively, while Hart Bochner as Ellis dishes out one of the best weasel turns to have ever graced a movie featuring corporate suit types. But as Die Hard resembles the great Westerns of yesteryear, much like the great Oaters, Die Hard could only be as good as its chief villain. As Willis' McLane ushered in a new action hero to copy, Rickman's uber intelligent villain set a new benchmark.Snappily dressed, well versed and as charming as they come, Gruber in Rickman's hands is a villain you could quite easily root for! That's further testament to Willis' turn that Rickman doesn't walk away with the movie, both men are from different sides of the fence, good and evil, yet both are characters you can hang your hat on. Quite a trick from McTiernan that. Rickman is ably supported by the scary Godunov as right hand man Karl and Clarence Gilyard Jr. as the cold hearted Theo. Elsewhere the impact of Robert Davi & Grand L. Bush as the two cocksure FBI agents Johnson & Johnson (no relation) should not be underestimated. All the actors, of course, are indebted to the sizzling script by Steven E. de Souza & Jeb Stuart. So to is praise due to photographer Jan de Bont, who in collaboration with McTiernan, produces a camera work lesson for action movies, as the camera swoops in and around the tower, down elevator shafts and up tilt to roofs; with the fight scenes afforded a spatial sheen not expected in the confines of a tower block setting (the film was actually shot at 20th Century Fox's own 2121 Fox Plaza). Even the scoring from Michael Kamen and the sound tracking are of a high standard; check out the various ""mood"" uses of Beethoven's Ode to Joy from Symphony No.9 and Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 In G Major: Brilliant.The 80s was well served by action movies with the likes of Lethal Weapon and Beverly Hills Cop proving massively popular. But just as Raiders Of The Lost Ark changed the game for action/adventure, so too did Die Hard. It's now the benchmark movie for action, a film that unlike Hills Cop & Lethal Weapon remarkably shows no signs of ageing either. It's no monkey in the wrench or a fly in the ointment, it's the daddy, and the one that all other action movies have to answer to. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Action
brilliant kick-ass adventure!,"""Die Hard"" is quite simply brilliant. It has a feel of ""rightness"" about it. It has the right plot, the right cast, the right script, and above all the right mixture of action and wise-cracking one-liners. The idea of having terrorists take hostages in a 30 storey building was a passageway for Bruce Willis to play the part he was born for. He is on top form here, in, personally, still his best film. He delivers the superb one-liners to perfection and ""yippie-kai-yay"" is famous world-wide. The action scenes suit Willis down to the bone. Also, Alan Rickman flawlessly plays the baddie. He made his character believable (and the German accent wasn't that bad). I would definately recommend this to anyone. Even people who don't like action films must be hard pressed not to be won over by the charisma and downright coolness of John Mclane. Die Hard rules.",,Anonymous,Action
Average Christmas Movie in Cali,"Fun action movie, an oldie but still good.I will admit that the first half was a bit boring, nothing much happening but then it slowly started escalating and then it had some really good moments.Overall a good movie, a very well known title among movies. The premise is very easy to follow, the main character is very witty, the pacing was good, didn't feel too slow or too fast.My only complaint would probably be the fact that he's just a New York cop. I mean it's cool that he's not some highly trained CIA agent or ex military veteran or anything of that sort but New York cop? That's a fantasy.

Terrific,"Bruce Willis steps into the role that made him a Hollywood star - vest-strapped, wise-cracking New York cop John McLane who finds himself fighting off a herd of terrorists in an LA skyscraper after arriving at his wife's Christmas party. A superior action film on every level, Die Hard oozes quality in every department - John McTieran directs the whole thing with remarkable aplomb and skill, the script is perfectly balanced between suspense and humour and Willis - love him or hate him - gives a terrific performance. Far more than a hollow 80's shoot-em-up, Die Hard is an artistically and technically dazzling film that serves as gripping and great entertainment from start to finish. The best of the series?

"Wonderful action if you like endless bombs, guns, bullets and blood.","I guess I'm in the minority, judging from other enthusiastic comments but despite the excellent production values, I found it more than ridiculous that all the bad guys are firing off umpteen rounds at Bruce Willis who never gets hit, and only suffers a cut foot from walking on broken glass. His antics and what he has to do stretches credibility to the limit. Too much violence, too much shooting, killing and so on. I stuck with it only because I thought it couldn't get worse but it did, leaving me with the ultimate question: WHY?  Is this what audiences are thirsting for? Sorry.

"If this is their idea of Christmas, I gotta be here for New Year's","This is my five hundred and ninety-fifth review since I registered IMDb account about three years ago, but jubilee thousandth rated title. I planned it to be something real awesome, but then last night I found out that my girlfriend never saw ""Die Hard"" and that tragedy had to be corrected right away.When it was released I was 9 years old and for years it was favorite movie to all boys in school. From today's perspective, although I fully understand why it was number one, I definitely have to overthrow it from the throne. I could write forever about this flick, but to cut long story short, in my opinion, what is really worth in this movie are incredibly charismatic Bruce Willis and Reginald VelJohnson and the last half an hour. Everything else is average, monotonous and even boring.During the movie, my personal impression was around 6/10, but because of emotional attachment, cult status and influence, and especially because of its ending, which leaves really strong impression, I have to rate it higher.

One of the greatest action films ever made,"Die Hard has had many sequels but none have ever had the sheer amount of thrills this one had. This movie is about a group of employees at a Christmas party who get taken hostage by terrorists and one cop in the building has to save them. It's funny, thrilling, it has great performances, and it has great actors. This movie makes every fight scene look very tense and it has creative kills for the terrorists. It also surprises us with its well-constructed script and its perfect pacing which remains consistent and easy to follow throughout the whole film. The movie is not perfect though because of the marriage conflict with McClane and his wife. It's great for an action movie to have a character development but I found it to be uninteresting. But this is a minor complaint on my part. Overall, this movie is fantastic. It's super entertaining and it has influenced many later action films. Many have tried to top this but none have ever succeeded.

"Superb cast, brilliant action!","(r#56)This was an exhilarating movie that anyone should be able to enjoy. Bruce Willis shines in his breakthrough role as John McClane, the wise-cracking hard-ass cop. Willis, although a rookie actor, handles his shamelessly bad-ass one-liners as well as his dramatic scenes very well and never feels unbelievable. Alan Rickman almost steals the show from Bruce himself as the ultimate German villain, Hans Gruber. Rickman is a fantastic actor and it makes me sad to see him sleepwalking through The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and the Harry Potter series when he should be focusing on finding a good script instead. We need more movies like Galaxy Quest and Die Hard from him.John McTiernan creates a perfect balance between the smashing action sequences, the character development and the humour, and as a result, Die Hard is one of very few movies that can be called ""perfect"" blockbusters. McTiernan had previously directed the Arnold classic Predator, but in my opinion Die Hard blows its predecessor out of the water in terms of pure awesomeness. The script is shock full of memorable lines that seem to have been written for Willis. The tension is thick throughout, but the comedy (mainly provided by McClane's one-liners, but also by a pathetically incompetent police deputy and an ignorant newsreader) never feels out of place or forced. It is perfection on all levels, and I wish that I could've been born in the late seventies just so I could've seen this film in the theatre.I don't think any fan of action could dislike Die Hard, and neither would most fans of movies in general. It is a great thrill-ride from start to finish and features some of the greatest one-lines in history. It's just plain awesome even 18 years after its release. See it.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Christmas Classic,Die Hard is a holiday classic. It's become a tradition for our family to watch during the Christmas season and always gets everyone in the holiday cheer!,10.0,Anonymous,Action
The Best Action Movie Ever And Definitely A Christmas Movie,"Die Hard is 80s action movies in a nutshell but what Die Hard does is bring us a action packed story with Drama, Romance and gore and swearing obviously Bruce Willis cements himself as a action star alongside Sly and Arnie and out of all of the Die Hard movies this is the most solid in the series.
Die Hard follows NYPD detective John McClane on holiday to visit his distant wife who lives with there children in Los Angeles and when he arrives at a Christmas party at Nakatomi Plaza armed terrorists lead by the well dressed and well educated Hans Gruber he is a man with a plan and he will pull off the ultimate heist if it wasn't for the New York cop with a plan.
The superb cast is lead by leading man Bruce Willis who plays the hero cop John McClain he wasn't orginaly the first pick to play the part so i'm glad that they picked him he was absolutly perfect in this role. Reginald VelJohnson is another star he plays Sgt Al Powell A desk jockey cop who is the first cop to respond and the emotional and moral support of John and throughout he is the only one who cares about John and we also learn his story about how he shot a kid and he was never right after that and we can sympathise with his character. Another amazing talent is Bonnie Bedelia who plays Holly Gennaro McClane she is so badass standing up for herself and not being scared of Hans and his goons and she has a lot of faith in her husband to take out the terrorists and she uses her intellegence to keep herself alive and she is such a great character. I can't talk about Die Hard without talking about the main bad guy himself Hans Gruber played by the always amazing Alan Rickman he is just so amazing if you have seen Die Hard you know this guy needs no explaination of why he is great and he is one of the best movie villians of all time.
also in the cast is Paul Gleason {Deputy Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson}, William Atherton {Richard Thornburg}, Hart Bochner {Harry Ellis}, James Shigeta {Joseph Yoshinobu Takagi}, Alexander Godunov {Karl},De'voreaux White {Argyle},Bruno Doyon {Franco} and Clarence Gilyard Jr. {Theo}.
What is there really to say about Die Hard it's a instant classic and spawned a whole franchise and other simular movies that are not as good as Die Hard is a movie that if you have not seen than you should it's a movie that everyone should watch around Christmas because it is a christmas movie and it's a great movie that you shouldn't miss out on watching and I would very strongly recomend this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
A trenchant action film classic,"John McTiernan's second mainstream film manages to amazingly top an outstanding previous effort, Predator. This even better film will resonate will audiences even more than Predator. While Predator was a superbly crafted and fairly straightforward sci-fi action thriller, this film takes the archetypal imperfect everyman loner, saddled with personal issues(in the form as an estranged relationship with is corporate high flying wife) and through a twist of fate has him battling, against the odds an international team of highly motivated and competent) bank robbers while trying to protect his wife, who is amongst the hostages these robbers have taken.It differed from both Predator and other action-thriller films of the period in that the hero was more human in physique, rather than the physical super-men such as Stallone, Norris and Schwarzenegger. He survives through determination and his wits rather than on brute strength, and Bruce Willis was a refreshingly original casting choice.The plot is cleverly structured and sets up all the characters seamlessly. There are good performances from most of the key players. The robbers are all interesting, but clearly most time is spent with Clarence Gilyard Jr. and the late Alexander Gudunov, who are both charismatic, albeit it is their boss, the relatively unknown at the time British actor Alan Rickman, who steals the show and is terrific in this film, and makes for a worthy rival and antagonist for Bruce Willis's John McClane. Bonnie Bedelia and Reginald Veljohnson are also good value, as is James Shigeta as Mr Takagi. However a couple of the characters do stray into caricatures, notably De'Voreaux White and Hart Bochner as Argyle and Ellis respectively. Fortunately the other performances and the film itself as so fast paced and involving you can overlook these slightly over the top performances, and they do not detract from the enjoyment of the picture.The good performances are woven into an expertly crafted film. Technical credits are outstanding. Jan De Bont's photography is stylish, and makes fantastic use of the Fox Plaza Tower to double for the Nakatomi building. He also makes clever use, but not over use of lens flares to create an excellent mood and atmosphere. Frank J Urioste's stunning editing, Michael Kamen's great music and Richard Edlund's brilliant but incredibly subtle visual effects all work together with truly fantastic action sequences and stuntwork, and director John McTiernan deserves huge credit. He draws out entertaining performances from most of the cast, but mixes this brilliantly clever setting up of the characters, and then orchestrating some truly outstanding action sequences with a pervading atmosphere of growing tension and suspense. It has stood the test of time brilliantly, it still by some way the best of the series, and overall comes off as a truly outstanding and emotionally satisfying thriller.Overall a terrific achievement that has not been bettered.",,Anonymous,Action

The Christmas Classic,"The perfect action movie in all ways. A relatable leading man in Bruce Willis who has believable struggles, clever action working around its own restraints, one of the best cinema villains ever in Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber and some of the most believable character work in action, in an age where the norm was to have everyone be a cardboard cut-out without personality.Bruce Willis was the perfect casting for every-man John McClane. His marriage is struggling for believable reasons, and when him and Bonnie Bedelia are on screen together, we can see both the chemistry that brought them together and the disputes that split them apart. He struggles with flying and feels out of place in the ridiculous prestige of the Nakatomi Plaza making him feel just as out of place as we would when everything ramps up.The action was brilliantly crafted and directed, which was a welcome change from director John MctTiernan who had previously directed mindless violence in ""Predator"". ""Die Hard"" however is clever, with characters always taking paths that avoid risk and even when things do escalate, the characters are intelligent over violent which makes Bruce McClane's survival believable.Then the Hans Gruber, calm and calculating at every turn. Alan Rickman perfectly portrays this making a drive and focused man who always completes his goals without delay or failure, crafting a character who is still one of the best cinema villains ever.Then there is the much-debated Christmas nature of the film. I personally think that it is a Christmas film, and a great one at that. It has the bright colour scheme of a Christmas film, all the Christmas music you could want and in the end it's a film about family. What more could you want from a Christmas film?I think of ""Die Hard"" as the perfect action movie, always taking itself seriously and treating itself realistically.

The film that defined a genre.,"""Die Hard"" is a film that defined a film genre.  Critics and film fans alike have looked to this film as one of the most influential films in recent years.  This film literally has it all.  Not only does ""Die Hard"" give us an incredibly charismatic hero, but also villians that the audience loves to hate, an underlying love theme, action, comedy, and special effects that were very well done.  The look and feel of ""Die Hard"" emerged from brilliant director John McTiernan.  At its core the plot seems to revolve around one cop's crusade to defend innocent civilians against terrorists.  However with this film the viewer must take a step back and look deeper into the film. In this film fan's opinion ""Die Hard"" is based on love.  John McClane's love for his estranged wife is his motivation to go on and survive.  McClane, our hero is portrayed in an interesting way.  McClane is an incredibly vulnerable man.  He takes unfathomable amounts of punishment and continues to go right at the terrorists.  The broken glass in his feet, the numerous cuts and burns and the various beatings handed to him have not deterred his fight.  McClane's battle is similar to that of Rocky Balboa who competed so dramatically against Apollo Creed, because of the strength and encouragement from his woman.  This love theme should not however overshadow the achievement of this film in terms of special effects, plot, and directing. McTiernan crafted an amazing picture that not only kept the audience guessing but also tells a story with characters the viewer can associate with.  From the beginning of the film the audience is immediately supporting McClane.  This film should be recognized not only as a an action film with great fight scenes and incredible special effects but also a story about love, determination, and the human spirit.",9.0,Anonymous,Action

A Remarkable Action Film,"This movie begins with a New York cop by the name of ""John McClane"" (Bruce Willis) arriving in Los Angeles to spend some time with his estranged wife ""Holly Gennaro-McClane"" (Bonnie Bedilia) and their two children during the Christmas holidays. Upon making his way through the airport, he is greeted by a limousine driver by the name of ""Argyle"" (De'voreaux White) who has been hired by his wife's company to take him to a party being held in their high-rise corporate office. Once there, he is greeted by the manager of the company ""Mr. Takagi"" (James Shigeta) along with Holly and a couple of her colleagues. Not long afterward, he goes to the washroom to freshen up and while he's away from those at the party, a dozen terrorists enter the building armed with all kinds of weaponry and proceed to take everyone hostage--everyone except John, that is, who is also armed and intends to free the hostages no matter what it takes. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this was an outstanding action film which, even though it is a bit long, kept my attention from start-to-finish. I especially liked the acting of Alan Rickman (as the terrorist leader ""Hans Gruber"") who was a perfect fit for the role along with that of the aforementioned Bruce Willis as well.

DH1,"The first of its kind that created a genre of its own. The direction of John McTiernan packs a wallop. What's interesting to see is how McClane conquers his internal conflict in the bathroom, so he may defeat his external conflict and finally decides to get outta there to find out what the fck Hans was doing upstairs. And from the start it wasn't a rescue mission, he was having a conversation with his wife... something that started 6 months earlier, only to get cut off. Also interesting to see the antag from being passive to becoming reactive when McClane steals his detonators.Very interesting to see Powell's trauma being resolved --- he swore to never draw his revolver ever.Michael Kamen's upbeat and tense score is unforgettable, in my book. I especially like the track -- during the scene where Hans hands Ellis the walky-talky.

An entertaining albeit unrealistic everyday hero film,"When the name Bruce Willis is mentioned, very few would remember or even think of him playing lighthearted character roles. The first thing people normally think of is either him just as an action star or the film Die Hard (1988). Like so many other movie stars, it only takes one popular film to cement one's name for the rest of history. Plus, according to Willis it is still his favorite film taking part in. Before this, it was hard even for him imaging that being a thing since all he played before that were more comedic aimed roles. However, that pigeonholed reputation would no longer hold water after seeing Willis perform in this picture. Not mentioning the sequels that would spawn afterward, the film itself has become another staple of the 1980s as time has gone on.The story takes place in what feels like the real world where New York cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) is headed to Los Angeles to visit his separated wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) at her new company's Christmas party. Unbeknownst to anyone, the holiday gathering has a set of uninvited guests. Enter Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) and his followers who are intending to take over the floor and get what they came for. Originally conceived in a novel by Roderick Thorp, the screenplay would be tweaked by Jeb Stuart in his first writing credit and Steven E. De Souza who wrote Commando (1985) a couple years before. Directing the film was John McTiernan, who a year before directed Predator (1987), the only film in a slew of sequels people feel legitimately deserves existing.Honestly what works in this movie is Bruce Willis playing what feels like a real person. The character of McClane is about as human as one can get. He's trying to amend his relationship with his wife, he doesn't have a high paying job, nobody else thinks real highly of him, nor does he fit into this whole holiday bash that's going on. Add to that the violent criminals now taking over the building, man is his luck just fantastic? It's not only the setup that makes McClane a lead audiences can back, but the lines written for Willis. Quips that are just the right blend of deadpan and sarcasm lighten the mood just enough not to feel like an action comedy but to point out there's got to be a way to cope with the issues going on at the moment.Helping the audience relate to McClane is local cop Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson) who is called to the scene by a fire alarm. While Powell does not get involved physically like McClane, the character also has his moments of relatability when it comes to taking orders and other things that get tied up bureaucratically. VelJohnson would shortly thereafter play the father in Family Matters. Of course one cannot talk about these two characters without covering Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber. Despite his hesitations, Rickman's performance even in his first theatrical film was impressive as an antagonist. Gruber is crafty and merciless. Enough said. Aside from these three, other actors like Paul Gleason, William Atherton, Hart Bochner, James Shigeta, Robert Davi and Grand L. Bush make appearances too.The only parts that may disappoint is the action. Some may think before seeing that it'll be a high octane action romp; not so. Additionally, because this film feels so much like it takes place in real life, some scenes that occur would likely not be able to happen in real life. That's where the realism is a bit over the top. Camerawork nonetheless though was proficient shot by Jan de Bont. The action set pieces and slower moving scenes all work in showing the surroundings they take place in. Finally, the music composed by Michael Kamen was interesting. The film score surprisingly does not include a main theme but he does manage to incorporate various holiday and classical related tunes in his tracks. Now with a final album in 2018, fans of Kamen can listen to three hours of music. That's a lot.The story feels so grounded in the real world, that anything crazy may feel unrealistic. That and it's not a mindless blow 'em up kind of film. The music and camerawork help along with Bruce Willis and his supporting cast members giving very authentic performances that any viewer could enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Action

A milestone in detective stories.,"A while after the movie started, I noticed something. It's a spoiler. There's a scene where the main character is in trouble and is in danger...but he's okay. But you see something that's why it's ok first. That doesn't make the viewer very nervous. Why does the director make these mistakes? When I was watching it, I thought... the most interesting idea comes at the end of the film. The one that needs to be spoiled first. It's very unique scene so it need spoiler. That's the answer that I thought why there were spoilers. To me, that was the most interesting thing about this film.

Mindless fun,"I just found out this is a Christmas movie. I had no idea. Now I understand why, cause it takes place at Christmas. Strange choice, but sure, why not, we want to have it easy on Christmas, don't we? So I watched it last night, and when I say night I really mean it, as in around 12 AM, and it's long, but I wasn't sleepy. Another one that I knew of so well that I questioned the need to see it or re-watch it, but I don't think I ever did really see it. And to be honest the draw for me was more Alan Rickman than Bruce Willis. Everybody is saying it was an iconic role for Alan Rickman and I can totally see why. He's got that international criminal mastermind swagger going for him, with a stiff upper-lip British flair, despite his supposedly German identity. And the iconic fall scene. So now I know what it was all about and Bruce Willis' yippee-ky-yay and the other lines and the frame in the shaft and the pictures in the wife-beater. Now I am in the know lol...
It is one big disaster movie, as in they destroy that whole building by the end, it's got armed vehicles, detonators, explosions galore, machine rifles, the whole package and it still stands today. It really does, surprisingly, which can only be credited to good professionals and decent writing. It's got enough tension and quips to keep you interested. Now the downsides are that it does work with plenty of cliches. The antagonists are very one-note and caricatures of villains. The German characters are insulting now, they got no nuance whatsoever, unlike with Hans Gruber. They are scary, destructive machines that refuse to die, till they have to. There is your regular amount of humour to defuse the situation here and there and give you a break, and the Black characters are given that very role. And the white hotshot cokehead so full of himself that he thinks he can fool everybody. What I'm saying is that it is a little racist with its character profiling. Also, there is a lot of melodramatic hero-worship to the point of becoming nauseating in certain places. But it is graphic, gritty and twisty-turny so you excuse all of that because you are entertained enough.From my research the third one of the five seems to be good as well so I think I'm going to check it out too, especially as it has Jeremy Irons as the villain, so I'm looking forward to that. I wonder if the character will be in the same vein as Alan Rickman's since the two actors do have a few things in common.",7.0,Anonymous,Action

The greatest non sci fi action film of all time,"Is this the best action movie of all time? Quite possibly. I think it's certainly in the conversation for a non sci fi one, thereby excluding the likes of Aliens, T2 and the Matrix etc. For me it has a similar quality that the aforementioned films have - they're timeless and just don't seem to date. Every aspect from the FX, music, cinematography, action scenes just gel in perfect harmony. There's something just... special at play with them.Onto Die Hard then. This film is just superb entertainment from the first minute. There's not a wasted bit of screen time before the action starts and it's spent quickly establishing the main players and laying ground for their universally well written arcs, bad guys and cops included, and they all get great pay offs.Once the action starts though it just doesn't let up until the end of the film. There's tense moments as Mclane is sneaking around trying to avoid detection, there's bone crunching, bloody violence, missiles firing at armoured vehicles, fabulous stunts, explosions (the helicopter explosion is still awesome) and gunplay, a plethora of players from the hostages, mclane, terrorist, police, FBI - all have memorable roles, with a great, twisting story running through it. Mindless it is not. Entertaining is an understatement here. It's just a relentless force of nature this movie with a great score and soundtrack to boot.It's also got a witty, humorous script that just crackles with sarcasm. Willis was a semi unknown at the time with people only really recognising him from the excellent show 'Moonlighting' and his casting is oh so perfect here. He's tough, funny, and vulnerable all at the same time and it just works so well. Rickman plays is one of the best villains in movie history here with a suave and sneering performance that provides the perfect foil. Even the side characters impress - from the sarcastic police chief, played to perfection by The Breakfast Club's Paul Gleason, Alexander Godunov's terrorist thug that has ends up having personal beef with Mclane. Robert Davi's low life FBI chief, Reginald VelJohnson's police officer who forms a bond with McLane without even meeting him and gets a great role, John's wife, Ellis, the reporter, the limo driver, all well written characters with engaging stories. Honestly, the character work here his just outstanding.Oh, and did I mention it's also the greatest Christmas film of all time?The opening credits has jingle bells on it.It's set on Christmas eve.There's Christmas music in it throughout.There's constant Christmas references, dialogue and imagery in it.'Now I have a machine gun, ho, ho, ho'Hans and Holly are Christmas names.The entire story is based around the fact that the building is empty because its the office Christmas party, making it perfect conditions for gruber's team to take hostages. This film could not happen without it being Christmas Eve.The film ends with the money from the robbery 'snowing' whilst a Christmas song plays.It's also arguably the most influential action film of the 80s and 90s, with a decade of 'die hard on a.....' you name it, bus, mountain, train the list goes on.I mean, really, are there any more superlatives I can throw at this film?

The action movie that defined a generation - and spawned a thousand imitations!,"Die Hard is regularly ranked as the greatest of all the 80s action movies, and among the greatest of all time, and even 25 years later, it is not difficult to see why. Die Hard really is action film-making at its best, and began a new type of actioner - the everyman caught in a unique situation - that many films would try to copy; some more successfully than others, but none would ever measure up to the original. That even includes the 4 (and counting) sequels! It would launch the careers of Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman skyward - admittedly on different trajectories - and even become a bizarrely popular choice for a seasonal festive film each December! John McClane (Willis) is a New York cop who has travelled to Los Angeles to reunite with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) at a Christmas party in a city skyscraper, when an armed band of villains march in with machine guns and take over, led by Alan Rickman's evil Hans Gruber, holding the partygoers to ransom. McClane must then work his way through the building, picking off the terrorists one by one, fighting a one-man war while the LAPD pontificates impotently on the doorstep.The recipe is incredibly simple, yet brilliantly effective; the ludicrous situation is tempered by the Regular Joe nature of Willis's character, allowing the audience to identify wholeheartedly with his efforts and motivations, while hissing at the Machiavellian machinations of arch-criminal Gruber. The action itself is replete with some superb and exciting shootouts, spectacular set pieces and a new level of violence not often seen in such a mainstream action film before now - just watch for the scene with the broken glass, and you'll be wincing for weeks! Bruce Willis so perfectly captured the essence of his character, that the image, hair and even name have become synonymous with action heroes for all movies hereafter. The iconic shaved head and dirty white vest perfectly captured the feel of the right man caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, but it was not just Willis's physique and wardrobe that made John McClane such a hero. His fight scenes are brutally brilliant, and his delivery of both threats and sarcastic one-liners will have audiences punching the air and chuckling in equal measure. His radio exchanges with Rickman's Gruber are superb, and his charming banter with Sgt Al Powell on the outside - also over radio - lend the character an extra warmth that could easily have been missed, which would have made the character slightly less sympathetic.But every great hero needs a villain, and Alan Rickman produced a performance of a lifetime; one which would lead him to being pigeonholed as a great British 'character actor' - Hollywood code for 'plays great villains!'. Admittedly this would lead him to even further success, most notably as the Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood Prince of Thieves, and of course Professor Snape in the Harry Potter films, but it was unquestionably this role that set him on the role to a reputation as one of the greatest villainous actors of the twentieth century. His performance is never overstated, and without resorting to scenery-chewing, makes every single line positively drip with threat and menace. But he is also allowed a few light moments of his own in between his shooting of innocent bystanders - darkly comic interplay with the FBI outside in particular. His arrogant dismissive nature of the FBI while reeling off a list of names the group want freed is particularly black - his request for one group that he then mouths to his associate that he 'read about them in Time Magazine' a standout. His ability to produce a villain who is both positively loathsome and yet darkly charismatic makes Die Hard just as much Rickman's film as it does Bruce Willis's. Jeremy Irons' attempt to reproduce this balance in the film's third entry pales in comparison, producing a villain that is fun, but unfortunately occasionally too camp to be truly hissable.The majority of the other characters are generally rather 2-dimensional, in particular McLane's estranged wife Holly, whose character is unfortunately lacking much in the way of back-story that could have made Willis's mission even more effective, whilst the henchman are as typically anonymous as you might expect from such an actioner. The rest of the attendees at the party are also mostly anonymous, making it difficult for the audience to truly get invested in their fate.But such quibbles are unquestionably minor next to the brilliance of the whole, and such was the film's success that virtually every action film of its type would thus be labelled as the 'new Die Hard' or the even more derivative 'Die Hard on a plane/train/boat/submarine' (delete as applicable). So to see how films like Die Hard actioners should be done, it can only be Die Hard itself. A true era-defining film, one that even gained numerous name-checks in 'Friends' to demonstrate its iconic nature, that became a perfect template for all subsequent action films to follow.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
"Great acting, well executed and iconic","A very solid action comedy elevated by fantastic central performances. The stunts have punchy impact and there seem to be very few computer effects used. Some of the peripheral characters are quintessentially 1980s, firmly placing die hard as a period movie for me. There are some cliche stereotypes especially the European bad guys and it has a very male macho feel, with very little for the few female characters to do. Overall I think it's iconic status allows its flaws to be overlooked but it is an incredibly well paced and executed action film.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
A true action masterpiece. Legendary.,"33 years later, it remains highly regarded as one of the best action movies ever made by many action fans. I'm only 29 but I think it is one of the best action movies ever made also. Whenever I think about what the standards are that an action movie should live up to in terms of craftsmanship, this is a movie that comes straight to mind. I also think of it when considering what a great action protagonist should be like. He or she is not invincible but can hold their own. They also should be likeable and relatable on some level. Enter John McClane, played flawlessly by Bruce Willis. My favorite performance of his is in this movie. I love Bonnie Bedelia, as his wife Holly McClane. I love Reginald VelJohnson as Al Powell, who would coincidentally go on to play another cop in a long-running sitcom where he was the neighbor of a kid who always ""did that"" (one of my favorite shows). I don't think anybody misses a beat in this movie. That leads me to the late, great Alan Rickman. He inhabited the role of terrorist Hans Gruber. An unforgettable performance by Rickman. He is every bit as strong of a villain as John McClane is as a hero. The odds are certainly against John as he has to square up against 12 terrorists as a lone man on the inside, while they are taking people hostage. The action, acting, editing, sound and the musical score are all wonderful. I'm not a filmmaker but if I were John McTiernan I would most certainly be proud to say that I made this movie right here. McTiernan also directed the 3rd film ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" which was also fantastic. And while I also enjoy ""Die Hard 2"" and ""Live Free or Die Hard"" (which I find underrated BTW, particularly the unrated cut), McClane works best when McTiernan is in charge. Notice I didn't include ""A Good Day to Die Hard"". If you noticed before I said anything, then you know why.",10.0,Anonymous,Action

"Overrated, interminable, and has not aged well","Boring, interminable, and more talk than action. I remember enjoying this film when I first saw it as a teenager, but it has not aged well. The beginning is too slow, and it takes too long for anything exciting to get started. Whenever there is any action, there are too many interruptions that were probably meant to be funny, but are just annoying, unnecessary, and interrupt the flow of the action. The action is mostly guns, explosions, and destruction--typical of big-budget Hollywood action movies of that era. As someone who had gotten used to the faster-paced Hong Kong action films of the '90s, which had silly plots, but at least had non-stop action and incredible fight choreography and stunts that you didn't see in Hollywood movies at the time, this one was simply somniferous for me. Not even Alan Rickman could save this movie for me, but at least he made a good villain, so I give this 1 star.",1.0,Anonymous,Action
"""Is the building on fire?""","No doubt about it, to a lot of people, Bruce Willis will ALWAYS be John McClane, for better or worse.In the film that made him a star, or at least got him out of TV work, Bruce Willis is New York native cop John McClane, come down to LA to see his estranged wife and family for the Christmas holiday. Then Hans (Alan Rickman, in one of his best evil performances) and a group of thieves posing as terrorists who look European male models and an obnoxious black computer hacker show up, take over the building and try to rob the place. Only McClane can stop them, and his only real support comes from Sgt. Al Powell (played by the dad from TV's ""Family Matters""). Calamity, chaos and mayhem ensue as McClane and the foreign thugs tear the building apart trying to kill each other in the ultimate battle of all American cowboy hero and sophisticated Eurotrash and the idiot cops and FBI gets trip over themselves to help out.Based on the novel by Roderick Thorpe. Bonnie Bedelia is Bruce's wife, and the late Alexander Godunov is Karl, who's vendetta with Bruce turns personal. Bonnie does well as the sympathetic wife with a bad haircut and Godunov, in a role very different from his debut part as an Amish farmer in ""Witness"", is surprisingly menacing in spite of his pretty boy looks. Of course, it helps that his career as a ballet dancer gave him more dexterity than the usual hulking henchman. His knock-down-drag-out brawl with Willis is one of the best.Alan Rickman commented that he didn't view Hans as ""the villain"", but more as a guy who ""has made certain choices in life, wants certain things in life and goes after them."" All the same, Alan is the perfect villain for Bruce's wise cracking McClane, who is neither weak nor super human. Bruce worked very hard on this film and allegedly did a lot of his own stunts and really brought a lot of life and warmth to a character who could very easily have been just another grim loner. It's a shame that he's had to spend the majority of his career trying to get away from this character (kind of like Sean Connery trying to live down his glory days as James Bond). And to think that Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Burt Reynolds and Richard Gere all turned this part down (probably better that they did).Sadly, the appeal of the McClane character was lost in #3 ""Die Hard: With A Vengeance"", where McClane HAD become a grim, burned out, wasted loner.A big part of the power of ""Die Hard"" is that there are no easy escapes, very few places to run and very little ""cheating"" as director John McTiernan put it. And it's true that very few moments require you to suspend logical disbelief, although we do have to question if it's possible to successfully pull of the stunt where Bruce jumps off the building with a hose wrapped around him.So grab the popcorn and get ready for the madness of ""Die Hard""! This is actually one of the few action films my family and I enjoy watching together. This was actually filmed at the 20th Century Fox Plaza.",10.0,Anonymous,Action

One of the best action movies of all time!,"Die Hard is really a work of art. It was one of the most influential action films today. Filmmakers are always trying to make the Die Hard of today. Die Hard is about a vulnerable everyday man trapped in a small restrictive area, and completely outnumbered.Bruce Willis plays John McClane, a New York cop that is going to LA for his wife's Christmas party at her work. Meanwhile a team of 13 terrorist, (not 12 like it says) lead by Hans Gruber played by Alan Rickman take over the Nakatomi plaza. Now it's up to John McClane, the man at the wrong place at the wrong time to stop the terrorists' plot.The acting from everyone is top notch. Willis is incredibly likable as John McClane and the supporting cast all do good with their roles. But the show stealer is Alan Rickman, who brings a sense of sophistication and class to the diabolical Hans Gruber. He is a guy you love to hate.One of my favourite things about the Die Hard series is the character of John McClane. I love his attitude, he kind of is a jerk that butts heads with a lot of figures who disagree with him like the police in this movie. But he still cares about people, which is why he became a cop. I love his relationships with the villains which is usually full of teasing, arguing and insulting each other which is always fun to watch.The film is a excellent blend of very intense moments, gripping drama, great action and stunt work, and a good sense of humour.

"A Towering action thriller full of wit, style & drama","Of all the action films to come out of Hollywood in the late 80s early 90s, Die Hard is perhaps the Mother of all of them. There is something strangely comforting about Bruce Willis' role as cop John McClane. We know the plot is quite ridiculous and yet Willis is so believable as the all action anti-hero that we go along with it all.DH is superior to movies like Lethal Weapon, Terminator, Speed & Mission Impossible because of Willis' charisma & personal charm which is not generally found with actors like Gibson, Arnie & Cruise.Another bonus about DH is that even though there are a lot of special effects we don't get bombarded with hi-tech unrealistic gadgets & hardware. Everything in the film is played with a genuine style & substance that is such a key factor with any John McTiernan movie. McClaine has to rely on his own wits & spirit for human survival while his contemporaries (Arnie, Cruise etc) can fall back on all those gadgets to get them out of a fix.Ably supporting Willis is Alan Rickman, a theatrical actor by nature, but really excels as the rather civilised yet evil German terrorist Hans Gruber, adding a little European style to heaps of American panache.It sometimes gets bogged down with the buddie-buddie relationship between white cop/black cop, while adding the FBI into the story is more of a distraction than an aid.DH is still the best of the trilogy, although whether Bruce feels up to donning the White Vest again in DH4 we will have to wait and see.***/*****",7.0,Anonymous,Action

Few have lived up this thrilling story,"Die Hard still remains, to this day, one of the best action films of all time. Directed by John McTiernan (The Hunt for Red October, Predator) and written by Jeb Stuart (The Fugitive), the story packs a great amount of action and suspense with memorably immortal characters.The acting: This was the film that propelled Bruce Willis to absolute stardom. Starring as the charismatic Officer John McClane of the NYPD, Willis lacks the Schwarzenegger-esque physique but shows us you don't need bulging muscles to defeat your foes. Rather, he is presented as the everyday Joe who is thrust into a flurry of German terrorists. His screen presence is strong throughout, with his witty one-liners (Yippy-Ki-yay, motha*****) and believable character development. There are smaller details presented where Willis reveals more of a vulnerable side to him (usually when he is alone) that perfectly contrasts his 'cop machismo'. As he barely escapes one threat presented after another, we are reminded that this is a normal guy in a highly abnormal situation.Another character who absolutely owns his screen time is Hans Gruber, played by an electric Alan Rickman. He gives a spectacular performance as the leader of the terrorists - conniving, intelligent and also has a comical side. His subtly sinister demeanor keeps us on the edge of our seat and we relish his every move. Perhaps that is why Die Hard has succeeded where so many other action films have failed. We are equally engrossed by both the virtuous and villainous figures presented.The screenplay: Taking place in predominantly one area for the majority of the film, Die Hard delivers one taut thrill after another. The sense of realism and grittiness does not seem too far-fetched, even for an action flick. The explosions are not superfluous and the gore is not unnecessary – it all helps in developing McClaine's character and shows us the right extent of how chaotic things become for him.I particularly loved the meta-humor (""This time John Wayne does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly."" ""That was Gary Cooper, a**hole."") And banter was common in this film, whether it being between Hans and John, John and Office Powell. The superb dialogue, acting and direction manage to elevate this film an echelon above its action-film wannabes.",10.0,Anonymous,Action

Wow! This one will blow you away!,"Die Hard is a must see for action fans. The plot is great. A bunch of bad guy terrorist, Oh wait a minute, Alan Rickman says ""Who said we were terrorist?"" Oh Well, Bad Guys take over a 40 story building in Los Angeles and take 30+ people hostage. Willis is the invisable ""pain in the ass"" cop who gets away and hatches a one man war against the bad guys. The stunts are great and the characters are great. Reginald Vel Johnson is great is pure comic releif. Alan Rickman is a great villan and the bad guy comic Clarence Gilyard Jr. I think this movie is great and anybody wanting action and top rate suspense, this is the ticket. One thing, if you've read the back of the DVD case, it says that John McClane is armed with a service revolver, that is wrong. McClane (Willis) is armed with an automatic not a revolver.

Pure Action!,"Christmas Tree - Yes
Christmas Music - YesDie Hard is definitely a Christmas movie. It is also a fantastic action movie. With a top-tier villain, an over-the-top protagonist and endlessly quotable lines, Die Hard is a film classic.That beings said, this movie is not perfect. Some of the characters are too dumb to handle (the emergency phone rep and the negotiator) and Carl Winslow's acting is a bit stiff (though his character is beloved).Die Hard is action at its purest and is a film that I will revisit every holiday season.Best Character: Hans Gruber

The everyman as action hero again,"I've always wondered why I've liked this movie than what seems like the rest of the population, so going into this watching, I was determined to figure out why. I definitely figured it out, and it's a solid thirty-minute chunk in the middle of the film. Everything around it is top notch entertainment, but that block of the movie's runtime is kind of painful.The main reason the movie works so well beyond that chunk is really Bruce Willis as John McClane. He's the everyman (but also a cop). He gets roughed up but defiantly maintains a certain humor about his situation. He strikes a balance between taking the situation seriously and maintaining his sanity through the insanity that erupts around him. He's a rather instantly likeable lead to guide the audience through. Across the way is Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber, and he's just a fantastic bad guy. He's smart, in control, and he has a plan. He only ever really breaks down once, when someone calls him a petty thief. He is an exceptional thief.And when the movie is about these two antagonists working against each other, the movie works like gangbusters. McClane shows up at the Nakatomi Tower to try and reconnect with his wife at her company's Christmas party, but Gruber shows up with a dozen men, intent on breaking into the company's vault, killing whomever they need along the way. The game of cat and mouse that develops between Gruber and McClane is fun, until it stops for thirty minutes. It's the second that Deputy Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson shows up that I begin to turn against the movie.Robinson is aggressively pig headed and stupid. I'm sure there are many police administrators out there who are just the same in real life, but that doesn't necessarily translate to compelling drama. He's got Sergeant Powell standing next to him telling him how to do everything right (something that begins to grate after a while, to be honest) and Robinson is completely dismissive. He doesn't seem to follow any known procedure, just throwing police bodies at a fortress without any concern. And, to make matters worse, John McClane can do almost nothing about it. He does end up saving the police after a while with a well timed application of C4 and a computer monitor, but watching our hero shout pointlessly at a window because everyone else is stupid is really frustrating. And then there's Ellis.I think if Robinson hadn't been in the movie and Ellis had been exactly as he is, he wouldn't bother me so much. But, right after Robinson is done being a complete idiot and derailing the central conflict, here comes Ellis to do the exact same thing, but smarmier and more 80s businessman. So, we get a full thirty minutes of two secondary characters dominating the movie by being idiots. Don't get me wrong, the action of the failed police incursion is done well and the tension around Ellis' failed negotiation works in isolation, but they push McClane to the sidelines.Once that's done, though, and the FBI shows up, the movie is right back on track. Now, the interesting thing about the FBI agents (Johnson and Johnson, no relation) is that they have a plan and fail at it as opposed to Robinson who had no discernable plan and just did stuff. Also, the FBI plan ends up successfully setting up the movie's action climax and gives us tense action beats that actually directly involve McClane.And that feeds into what, again, makes Gruber such a great villain. The FBI does what it should do. It follows a rule book, but Gruber knows the rule book and uses it against them. It's a competent plan by the FBI being outsmarted by an intelligent bad guy in Hans Gruber. As opposed to the police incursion which is pretty much just Robinson hitting his head against the wall for no reason.So, I've complained enough. My problems with the movie are really that thirty-minute segment in the middle of the film. Outside of that, I love the movie. Willis and Rickman are great. The supporting cast is really good. Action is great. Tension is palpable. The character of McClane strikes a delicate balance between indestructible and vulnerable while Gruber is really smart and very good at what he does, creating a great foil between protagonist and antagonist. I really like this film, I just kind of wish I liked it a bit more like everyone else.",7.0,Anonymous,Action

In the rare pantheon of outstanding Hollywood action movies,"Nearly twenty years and millions of clichés later, the original Die Hard still holds up in all of it's Hollywood glory. One of the last films to come out of that greater era of quality popcorn entertainment (compared to today's standards), this fluidly visceral, though lighthearted study into the hostage tensions overtaking 40-story Nakatomi plaza has become a modern day action classic for all the right reasons.Sure some characters have devolved into caricature upon recent viewings (Hart Bochner's coked up Ellis), sure the entire mechanics informing this intense ordeal feel a little less gripping in retrospect, and sure an excess of one-liners can degrade the entire process on the whole...but not by a whole lot. Die Hard was perfectly calibrated to be as entertaining as it was bloody, adult, and exciting when it arrived. While time may have extracted a percentage of the urgency out of this eternally exciting experience, conceptually the original Die Hard will continue to remain one of the most captivating settings ever staged in a modern action film. The selfless direction from John McTiernan was hitting it's stride as he captured progressively intense battles in a simultaneously spacious and claustrophobic setting.It is the triumphant locale which hosts this intelligent robbery thriller that will continue to beckon re-visitation, though without the considerable tension between our two leads, Nakatomi skyscraper would remain an empty gesture. Bruce Willis could not have asked for a better early career move then to star as New York cop John McClane. Even if it did pigeon-hole his limited talent, Willis already displayed the raw intuition that made him one of our most agreeable action stars. His everyman style was one of instant cult likability: a person most average joe's could relate to, thrust into a situation no one could relate to. His line deliveries will pale to the actor who has slightly but surely refined his craft over many years, but the finesse with which he eases into the action with believability and likability became instantly recognizable.",8.0,Anonymous,Action

Not only is Die Hard one of the best action movies of all-time, but it is also one of the most influential ones.

Die Hard,"Hardened NY cop ""McClane"" (Bruce Willis) arrives at the launch of the new building where his estranged wife ""Holly"" (Bonnie Bedelia) works, only to discover that she's now started using her maiden name. Humph!!! Luckily (for us) this is just the start of his woes as ""Gruber"" (Alan Rickman) turns up with his well equipped gang intent on robbing the place of millions of dollars worth of bearer bonds in a complex and meticulously planned heist. The best laid plans, though, and soon the secreted ""McClane"" realises the dangers to himself and his missus, and so has to clandestinely manoeuvre himself around the incomplete structure trying to nobble the baddies and keep himself alive long enough for the cops and/or the FBI to show up. When they do, he soon discovers that but for the savvy ""Al"" (Reginald VelJohnson) they are all rather gung-ho eedjits. It's now a battle of wits between the two men and what ensues is action packed, genuinely witty and yep - it's definitely a Christmas film. Sometimes it's not so easy to remember why Bruce ever became famous at all, but when you see his natural charisma partnered here with an on-form Rickman (even if his accent has moments of madness all of it's own) and some suitably beefcake Eastern European muscle and we get some entertaining banter and loads of pyrotechnics at the denouement of an engaging thriller.

Still regarded as the quintessential action movie twenty five years on,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAs Christmas Eve looms in Los Angeles, New York detective John McClaine (Bruce Willis) arrives to meet his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedilia) at the Nakatomi Plaza. All is going smoothly enough, until a group of terrorists lead by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) seize control of the building and take everyone inside hostage-all except McClaine, who takes the terrorists on at their own game, in a deadly duel to the death.The 80's was the decade where the last of the great big ideas were brewing, where the studios thought big and delivered bigger, where concepts became franchises and true artistic integrity became a distinct after thought. That's not to say most of the ideas weren't truly inspired, and didn't have the potential to become big investments. Trouble is, the last year in that decade is now very nearly twenty five years ago, leaving the time period itself very much as a thing of the ages. But it is now twenty five years since Die Hard burst on to the scene, and to it's credit, is still hailed by many after all that time as the definitive action film which set the standard by which all others are measured and of which countless imitations have been made. If nothing else, watching it again will wash the memory of that Godawful new film released earlier this year out your mind and remind you of the joyful, exhilarating spectacle that inspired the series in the first place.Bruce Willis made his name with this role, making it all his own and putting his stamp all over it as the cynical, gnarly detective who proves a one man battle machine for the villains he's engaged with. The massive appeal here is almost certainly his presence as an every-man the average, predominantly male action fan could probably relate to, having been force-fed the impossible image through-out the 80's of the muscle bound, mumbling killing machine they could never live up to. McClaine is totally believable as a resourceful but bewildered man of the law thrown in to a situation he wasn't expecting, while Rickman as his adversary is restrained, jovial but also utterly cold and ruthless, determined to see his plan through to the end. Between them, they are a brilliantly twisted double act.Some ideas are so good, and are executed so faultlessly, they deserve to become profitable institutions, spinning off with other versions and sequels, being imitated many times and still holding a special place in everyone's heart twenty five years on. Die Hard is full of explosive, exciting action, is brilliantly written, with great characters, fine dialogue and even finer set pieces. And all that aside, it's just great fun. It's success really speaks for itself. *****",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Good action film,"Good action film. New York cop John McClane travels to Los Angeles to work things out with his estranged wife, only to find her office block at the mercy of terrorists, and he is their only hope of rescue. Die Hard did two things - it created a template for big budget action thrillers with one good man against the massed forces of evil, and it turned Bruce Willis from a moderately successful light romantic actor with a predominantly TV career into a major macho big screen star. Die Hard was pretty good. It pushed the boundaries of suspension of disbelief, but it never stepped over them. It gave us excellent baddies, a resourceful and admirable - though not perfect - goodie, some idiots (and one sound ally) on the outside, and a claustrophobic environment and solid scenario within which all the elements could play out.

no redeeming value,"This film has almost everything that I despise. I do like the action, explosions, and Alan Rickman since he stars as Severus Snape in the seven Harry Potter flicks. Rickman is excellent at playing the bad guy. Bruce Willis thinks he is so cool; however, but nothing but a fool. So the two stars are for Rickman and the action. The subtraction of eight stars is for the ballooning votes that this movie has been given, the violence, the nudity, the vulgarity, Bruce Willis, the mindless acting by the majority, the length of the film, and finally not giving Rickman more lines. Yes, it's a slight obsession with Rickman as it seems, but I had to think of eight reasons and ran out of ideas. So if you like or love this imbecilic claptrap, you will most likely disagree with me and jump to conclusions while forming stereotypes. I don't blame you.

The greatest action movie (not to star Arnie),"I've decided to leave a review for 'Die Hard' exactly thirty years since its release in 1988. Partly because it still holds up after all that time as one of the greatest action movies ever made and, secondly, because it has just (officially?) been classified as a 'Christmas movie.' So, does it promote festive cheer and goodwill to all men? Or does it just give you the manual on how to kill unlimited bad guys with a machine gun, a witty quip or two and dirty feet. Probably the latter really, but, for the record, it is SET at Christmas and a famous Christmas song even plays it out. What more do you need to pull a cracker and eat Xmas pudding to?For anyone that doesn't know, the plot to 'Die Hard' involves a cop getting stuck in a giant building during a terrorist takeover. Guess what? He fights back. It's a simple plot and that's its main strength. It never really tries to be anything that its not. Bruce Willis may have been around before 1988, but it was no doubt that it was 'Die Hard' that cemented him as an 'A-list' star. Granted he's reprised his role as John McClane numerous times since, however one (of the many!) criticisms thrown at the sequels is that he's become a 'superhero' in human form, i.e. he can do anything and is completely invulnerable. But, back in the first outing, we really do feel his pain as he limps, crawls and drags his way through the building's air ducts in order to simply survive the night, let alone take out the entire squad.In short, Bruce Willis was actually 'relatable' back then. But, what is a hero without a good villain? Not much. But luckily, as 'Die Hard' cemented Willis as an A-list protagonist, it also did the same for Alan Rickman as the dastardly terrorist leader, Hans Gruber. I read somewhere that the best films involving a clearly defined hero and villain explore the relationship between them (test it out - the movies that don't really work almost always have the hero and villain never meeting/interacting until the final showdown where the hero inevitably kills the villain). Here, the two spar not just physically, but mentally thanks to McClane stealing one of the terrorist's radios and mercilessly taunting Gruber as he dispatches one henchman after the next.So, you have the relatable hero, the evil villain and the simple plot. What more could you want from an action movie? Well... action, maybe? And it's here tenfold. The wonderful thing about eighties action movies was that they were real. Or rather the special effects were really there on screen, rather than the actors filming up against a green screen and the explosions added later. All the fights here actually look like they could really happen. Yes, we always have to suspend our disbelief that one man shooting at a hundred has a better chance of killing them than the other way round (but then we've been doing that since James Bond first sipped his Martini!). But the action looks real and it's the final icing on this most unexpected Christmas cake.Die Hard' may now be a Christmas movie, but you really can watch it any time you want a simple, yet excellent action film that really doesn't have many flaws (or at least none that detract from its brilliance). It really has been the template for many an inferior action movie to come. Yippie-kay-yah Christmas to you all!",10.0,Anonymous,Action

It's conventional but we still love  it,"In many people's minds the term 'action thriller' is defined as predictable, over exaggerated and boring.I tend to agree the majority of the time, especially after watching films like 'Mission impossible II' and 'James Bond' where the predictability was as present as Bond's sarcasm, ridiculously predictable and unrealistic.Thankfully director John McTiernan was able to add a likable quality to the genre Bruce Willis stars in this 1988 smash hit action thriller which does contain a lot of typical action thriller conventions but why do we criticise? We see him running around Nakatomi towers and with his cheeky attitude and delivering cheesy but hilarious quotes, I found myself appreciating the character and the genre.What was predictable was having many gun scenes which were unrealistic but that is always expected of this genre. Thankfully Die Hard doesn't reach to the extremes as MI2 does and the majority of gun fights and character action codes are believable but ARE enjoyable. Viewers are able to associate with the central protagonist John McClane who is sarcy and purely likable, I found it impossible to hate him. The bad mouthed cop is always on the move and willing to conform to the ideologies which director John McTiernan set, and are pulled off beautifully.Alan Rickman is astonishing as the head terrorist Hans Gruber. His evilness is forever present as he controls the role beautiful with his established role and his cheekiness is great to, a more established and influential villain than some bond villains such as Elliot Carver in 'Tomorrow never dies'.The partnership of Rickman and Willis was great. Having two contrasting characters worked wonders as the two bring their own beliefs to the story and viewers can appreciate these different beliefs by characters who are very interesting to observe.The story is fast flowing and kept me on the edge of my seat for the full two hours. A fast placed plot with typical action conventions was crafted magnificently and appreciates the genre by using gun fights, stereotypes of villains, cops, the FBI etc to great effect. It is what many would expect but the humour, emotion and action ideologies are well crafted together, conveying an enjoyable action film.Question marks hover over the beginning and the ending. The beginning is slow and may appear uninteresting and the ending is very over-exaggerated like many of the action scenes but I can't help but like it.Having the film set in one setting, Nakatomi towers, was vital to the films success because being in a claustrophobic area allows the central protagonist's opinions to be limited, viewers are inclined to know how he is going to solve the problems with only a few options.It is a very captivating film with the acting by everyone influential. The conventions of action are present but are more enjoyable than others because of the humour used.Anyone with a strong gut and a thirst for riveting action scenes and dry sarcastic humour, believe me, you will love it.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Hard to beat,"I saw Die Hard at the cinema in 1988 and countless times on VHS. At the video store in 1988 or early '89 when Die Hard was a VHS new release, the VHS cover read: 'The best action movie you will see' or 'The best action movie you will ever see'. Die Hard quite possibly lives up to the claim. Even my dad who didn't like action movies and who wanted to take me to psychologist 'cause most of the movies I liked were violent, even my dad liked Die Hard. Part of its genius is the setting; the Nakatomi building; it's almost a metaphor for being under appreciated. John McClane's alone and trapped inside a high rise building that towers above the unaware, unsympathetic world below. Eddie Murphy's character (Reggie Hammond) in Another 48 Hours (1990) says: 'I've been having a very bad day'. That's John McClane (Bruce Willis): he's having a very bad day; adversity's coming at him from all angles, including the Nakatomi building itself. And the cat and mouse, cyclical nature of the action; it goes round and round like the winding stairwells: clever. Die Hard's exhilarating e.g. The helicopters swooping through the city streets. Is Die Hard perfect? No. Criticisms: it celebrates violence: at the end when pacifist cop Powell who hasn't drawn his gun in years, draws his gun on the Fabio lookalike and blows the Fabio lookalike away, I can't help but affirm that Die Hard conveys that shooting someone's a glorious thing. And as if McClane's body wouldn't be cut by glass as he crashes through the window and is dragged by the fire hose at the end.

"""The Ultimate Action Showcase That Redefined a Genre""","If you're looking for the quintessential action flick that set the standard for everything that followed, look no further than *Die Hard*. Released in 1988, this film isn't just a movie; it's a masterclass in tension, heroism, and unforgettable one-liners that have become ingrained in pop culture.From the moment John McClane, portrayed brilliantly by Bruce Willis, steps into Nakatomi Plaza, you sense the stakes are high. The movie expertly balances nail-biting suspense with moments of levity, as McClane battles not just a group of highly-trained terrorists led by the suave yet ruthless Hans Gruber, played by Alan Rickman in a career-defining role. The chemistry between Willis and Gruber is electric, providing a cat-and-mouse dynamic that keeps you on the edge of your seat.*Die Hard* is a relentless thrill ride, with stunning set pieces and ingenious action sequences that push the boundaries of what an action movie can be. McClane's inventive tactics, like using a fire hose as a makeshift bungee cord or his iconic ""Yippee-ki-yay"" showdown, showcase his ingenuity and resilience. The film's gritty realism sets it apart from its predecessors, making every bullet fired and every explosion feel punchy and visceral.The film's pacing is perfect, with tension building through clever writing and a rich score that evokes a sense of impending doom. This is a movie that keeps you guessing, with unexpected twists and a character arc that truly makes you root for McClane-a flawed yet relatable hero fighting against all odds.*Die Hard* didn't just launch a franchise; it established a template for action movies that countless filmmakers have emulated, but few have matched.

[9.5] The SOFORT that I dearly learned,"I'm back in 1988, when Die Hard came out and I'm reliving that year in memory.A superb action movie that's a standard by itself with great everything, being its screenplay, acting, development, flow and ending.It isn't the first of the genre and surely won't be the last, but is the only one directed by the very talented director John McTiernan that combines suspense, thrill and magic.Loved the stellar cast, loved the magical score and loved the broken glasses, falling and sparkling before my eyes.I still see Hans Gruber, extending his hand, desperately trying to reach a long lost chimera...

Most brilliant action thriller of all times.,"I won't say much about this film, the ""father"" of a new kind of action movies. There was a before DIE HARD, and there is an after DIE HARD. The same with CONAN, DIRTY HARRY, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, HEAT, SCARFACE and so on. The kind of movie which provokes a chain reaction of hundreds of rip-offs. The only detail which I would like to talk about is the novel which this masterpiece is inspired from, a book written by Roderick Thorpe, the author of THE DETECTIVE. I read both books and I am still astonished to see how much they both are different from each other. As if you compared HAMLET and STAGECOACH. Same hero character in both, but for two soooo different topics and atmosphere, style and writing. And the novel seems very close to the movie, yes, but not on the meaning. In the novel the hero was visiting not his wife but his daughter. She was working for a huge company which, in the late seventies, sold weapons to the Chile dictatorship, a right winged regime that the terrorist of the story wanted to denounce. So, you see, this scheme is really far from the film's ""message"". The novel is really gritty, bitter in the meaning, The hero in the book doesn't hesitate to kill in cold blood some female terrorists who, at the end, fight for what they are convinced to be a fair fight against facism in Chile. The book is really immersive, radical, visceral, profound and dark. That's just what I want to say. One last thing, there is not a day in my life where I don't think about the loss of John McTiernan whoo seems to have the great difficulties to emerge since his relased from jail, back in 2014. Please, come back to us John !!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Action
A monumental film,"Bruce Willis stars as John McClane, a New York cop who flies out to Los Angeles to meet with his estranged wife at a Christms party in an LA Highrise that belongs to a wealthy company for which his wife works. Unknown to the guests, a group of terrorists headed by Alan Rickman takes everyone hostage, except McClane who manages to sneak by. Left with only his pistol, brains, and brawn McClane starts to give the bad guys hell.US action pictures were never the same after this film came out in 1988 and in watching it you can easily see why. Placed in one building over one night with one hero, who could have imagined such an exciting movie? Other 80s action films, while many of them are classics, never quite managed to accomplish what Die hard did so well. It is not the relentless action nor the characterization, but both of them combined. McClane is introduced like any other cop would be and not like some big guy who is obviously going to kick ass like say Schwarzenegger was shown in Commando. This film put a real human side to its hero - he's tough as nails, but not invincible. He relies on his brains and his brawn. He winces in pain, but pushes on. And of course he snaps wise-cracks and quotable lines: I mean who can truly forget ""yippy-kah-yay, motherf***er"" after seeing this movie even once?And it is not just the hero, but the villains he combats as well. They have their unlikable side and are obviously meant to be the bad guys, but they have their brains, their brawn, and of course their own weaknesses. Scripters Jeb Stuart and Steven de Souza must have gone about describing the villains pretty carefully in their screenplay and they have created a memorable bunch little army that is not your typical cardboard cut out set of villains. They range from a hacker who can't fight if his life depended on it to the mountainous assault rifle packing Karl who makes John McClane's day especially bad. Interestingly, Karl's seemingly endless fury isn't just an excuse to have a ""real tough ass"" bad guy, but it is characterized and introduced in of itself.Also, the music is very well developed. Beethoven's 9th is the backdrop for the score and it is interesting to see how it was put into the story in a both diagetic and a non-diagetic level. Added to that, they even put a Christmas twist to it.Finally, when you consider the fact that this one movie not only spawned an overall great trilogy, but a whole little sub-genre of ""Die Hard on a..."" makes this a great film all around. 10/10Rated R: violence and profanity",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Monkey In The Wrench,"Sure he shoots people and blows things up, but there is only one moment in ""Die Hard"" where smooth criminal Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) loses his cool: When a woman realizes what he is up to, and tells him he is nothing but a ""common thief."" ""I am an exceptional thief,"" Hans says after vaulting a desk to get in her face. ""And since I'm moving up to kidnapping, you should be more polite.""""Die Hard"" likewise may be just an action film, but it is an exceptional action film, an entry in an already overcrowded field of cinematic bloodbaths that dared to be more than a little clever and insightful about the human condition even as it upped the ante on the on screen violence.Hans and his Euro-goons help matters considerably, by projecting real personality along with the menace. You understand their motivations, enjoy their humor, and still relish their comeuppance at the hands of a New York City cop played by Bruce Willis who finds himself alone against the bad guys in a Los Angeles skyscraper.Willis became a movie star from his performance here as John McClane, and it is very good. Willis projects his usual smugness, but manages to ingratiate himself to the audience early on in a key scene with his limo driver, Argyle, who presses him on what he's doing in L.A. if he's from New York. McClane says he's here to see his wife, who works here, and alludes to some trouble in their marriage, saying he couldn't also move to LA because of his responsibilities to the NYPD.Argyle won't let up. ""You mean you thought she'd come running back before you packed your bags,"" he laughs. McClane winces, but smiles. ""You're very quick, Argyle."" It's not a major moment, but it points up a key strength of this film. Everyone in it matters. Whether it's Argyle, McClane, Hans, a cop doing what is supposed to be a routine drive-by, a cokeheaded businessman, or a gunman with a sweettooth, the brilliant script by Jeb Stuart and Steven de Souza and deft direction by John McTiernan gives everyone a certain weight and presence that adds to the proceedings.For most of the film, McClane doesn't have Argyle to talk to, so he talks to the audience instead, in a series of monologues made believable by the pressure he is under (he seems to be in the habit of talking to himself anyway) that give McClane a humanity and humor unique for action films. ""Now I know what a TV dinner feels like,"" he says when crammed in a vent shaft. It's not that his one-liners are so clever, but that they come at the right times. Willis crafts a hero viewers can relate to, which makes his heroics more satisfying.The film also succeeds as a straightforward caper film, since the caper itself is intelligently designed and presented in such a way we sense we know where everyone of Hans' dozen underlings are at every given moment, even when the camera isn't on them. Also, the action scenes are incredibly well-done, grittier than anything else on screen at the time yet still entertaining.Okay, the picture is too glib at times, and shows Willis' hunkitude off more than I care to see. The phony business with the walkie-talkie chatter (you can't cut in on other people's transmissions the way everyone does here) is annoying, and the business with the TV reporter should have been left on the cutting room floor.But ""Die Hard"" is a film every bit as brilliant now as when it came out, influential, never equaled, and incredibly fun. Rickman is a great villain. And what can you say about a musical score that encompasses Vaughn Monroe, Run-DMC, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Christmas music? This is a film that leaves nothing out in its ambition to entertain, and succeeds wonderfully.",9.0,Anonymous,Action

Take Note This Is How Action Should Be Done,"The eighties was the decade of the big blockbuster action flick - Lethal Weapon, Beverly Hills Cop, Cobra, Commando etc. But one film outdoes them all and this is it Die Hard, the action sequences are superb and set the standard for everyone to follow. The premise is a good one and while not exactly realistic it provides a firm base for some rocking action.Our main hero John McLaine (Bruce Willis) is well drawn and manages to avoid falling into the cliché trap of some action hero's, a sub-plot with his estranged wife is given just the right amount of time to provide depth without spoiling the pacing of the movie or feeling tacked on. The other main relationships in this movie is equally well played with the one good cop on the outside John forms a bond through humour and necessity and the interplay between them provides a nice counterpoint to give the audience a chance to draw it's breath.Also credit has to be given to Alan Rickman as Han Gruber for creating one of the best bad guys of any action flick, Rickman seems to have a nice line in bad guy persona's as he was easily the best thing in Robin Hood Prince of Thieves playing the sublimely evil Sheriff of Nottingham. But lets face it action is what we want here and boy those it provide it, bad guys are picked off left right and centre, a rooftop shoot out and one incredible explosion.If you love action movies and you haven't seen Die Hard get out there right now and get yourself a copy it'll be the best move you'll ever make.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Action

A hardcore action drama you didn't expect to be a Christmas film!,"Die Hard (1988) :
Brief Review -A hardcore action drama you didn't expect to be a Christmas film too! Social media is always divided into two categories: one who says Die Hard is a Christmas movie, and the other who believes that it is not. There is no answer to this question, as there is no answer to who came first, chicken or egg? But isn't it fun to have a movie for both themes? You watch it as an action film, and you get what you want. You watch it as a Christmas movie, and you get that as well. Die Hard is a hardcore action drama that fulfils all the promises of the genre, and then there is an unexpected Christmas dose too. Of course, I wouldn't count it as a Christmas movie just because it takes place during the season. There had to be something related to Christmas in the script, and this film hasn't got it. Anyway, who the heck cares about the genre and theme when you are spending 2 hours on a movie that is worth it? Watching this movie in my college days a decade ago was a different experience, and now watching it as a movie buff/critic is a totally different experience. Now I understand it better. Why is it so popular? First because it is a superb action drama. Not as groundbreaking as Terminator, but definitely superb on a ground level. The story also makes it easy. A cop visits a city during Christmas and accidentally gets into the same building, which is hijacked by deadly terrorists. His wife is there in the building, so he has to save her and, by default, others. ""His job,"" says his wife. ""Only John can make someone so pissed."" What the hell? How stimulating that stuff was, man! ""Nine million terrorists in the world and I gotta kill one with feet smaller than my sister,"" that's his attitude after killing the first terrorist. This one's on John McTiernan, Bruce Willis, and Alan Rickman.RATING - 7.5/10*By - #samthebestest.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Treats its central subject as mere window dressing,"Apparently the interwebs have collectively decided this film is a Christmas film, despite it being about a heist being stopped by a cop. The reason for this is the soundtrack is a lot of Christmas songs, the screenwriter contrived the scenario vis-a-vis a Christmas party, and rote themes about (re)connecting to family.Fair enough if you want to use this definition of ""Christmas film"".However, such elements are not essential to the film and if they are intended to be the central subject the film clearly, unequivocally fails. They are on the edges of the story and sometimes literally the frame. They are not deconstruction Christmas tropes nor ironic invoking Christmas iconography. It's almost as if screenwriter wrote a heist story first and added the Christmas references as mere color. But the interwebs have decided this cannot be.On its own terms, this film is 80's action with slightly more plausible plotting and more gritty action scenes. It is entertaining enough but it has not real substance. The fact the most common debate about the film is whether or not it is a Christmas film says a lot about how weighty this film is. It rates a little higher as an action flick than a Christmas film but who am I to set the standards?",3.0,Anonymous,Action

McClane escapes but what can he do alone against a large group of terrorists?Full of action, excitement, incredible stunts and tons of gunfights and fistfights. When you think about it the plot it's highly improbable but once the action kicks in you won't care. I saw this opening weekend when it came out in 1988. In first run theatres the Dolby stereo was turned up as loud as it could go. There were LOTS of gunfights and explosions in deafening stereo sound. It was GREAT!

His struggle to remain undetected and conserve ammo is one that you feel genuinely drawn into.Alan Rickman is also superbly cast as the villain, giving a great performance as Hans Gruber.

The Real 'Last Action Hero',"1988 saw the peak of modern action films. It will be forever imitated but never bettered. White vests and catchphrases at the ready..Its DIE HARD John Mclane is a New York cop, recently separated from his wife Holly. Holly works for a big business company in the heart of California and is celebrating the opening of a new mega-plex building 'Nakatomi'. She invites on-off husband to the opening ceremony and his arrival quite nicely co-insides with the arrival of a group of party-spoiling terrorists led by a German named Hans Gruber. Good job he brought his gun then! Directed by John Mctiernan, Die Hard, saw the first and best action film with soul, and a lead hero who wasn't actually invincible. Struggling with the issues of doing his job, saving his wife, escaping from the building etc, John Mclane comes across as someone who actually has a heart, someone who can be beaten and above all, someone we can genuinely like.The film follows Mclanes exploits as he scurries around the 'Nakatomi' plaza evading terrorist grasp whilst trying to help cops on the outside diffuse the situation. He's not an Arnie type character whos just there to empty a few clips, he's simply stuck in the situation and just doing the best he can, which incidentally sometimes isn't all that much.There is a particularly good scene where Mclane succumbs to the likelihood that he may never escape alive and in a heartwarming scene, relays a message to a cop on the outside 'Al' to pass on to his wife. Fighting tears whilst trying to remove shards of glass from the feet of his broken body, we find that this guy is real. He's human, and very much destructible. Hence we back his corner more.Bruce Willis stars as the said cop, elevating him to super stardom from then on. It was a film requiring excellent acting skills over a toned physique and casting was spot on. Alan Rickman plays the terrorist leader Hans Gruber and Bonny Bodelia Mclanes wife Holly. All parts are played superbly, further increasing the immersion.Now, Die Hard IS still an action film. There's a lot of explosions, fighting, swearing and heroics but thanks to great scripting, acting and directing, it never becomes clichéd. The pacing is spot on. Scenes of dialogue are freed by a gun-fight and harrowing scenes, followed by hate-fuelled violence. Its got explosions, but never too many, dead bodies, but never dwelled upon, its got swearing, but never for swearings sake and its even got a catchphrase, but even that is believable given the feelings and emotions going through Mclane as he battles for his own life as well as his wife and hostages. And thats the key to its success: Perfect pacing and perfect balance.This all may sound very deep for an action film, and it probably is, but when you watch it you'll most probably think..'That was absolutely amazing' and you wont know why. Well this is best an analysis i could make. We sit there and just take for granted how much effort goes on in the background.Wise people say that 'when you've done your job right, people wont know you've done anything at all' Here here i say.Yipee-Kiyay! movie lovers",10.0,Anonymous,Action

Altogether perfect... my favorite movie,"For my 100th review on IMDb.com, I have decided to go with my all-time favorite movie, ""Die Hard."" It is, in my mind, the greatest action movie ever made, and also one of the best movies ever made, period. Its only purpose is to entertain, and entertain it does, without a single dull moment from start to finish. It flies along at a lightning pace, the pyrotechnics and stunts are amazing, and the entire cast shines. McTiernan takes full advantage of the setting, and there is a genuine feeling of claustrophobia and heart-pounding suspense when McClane is sneaking around in the vents and elevator shafts.Direction aside, even the script itself is cleverly written, with a lot of humor thrown in, and interesting, well-thought-out plot twists (such as McClane taking off his shoes in the beginning, only to seriously regret it later on). It was also a stroke of genius on the screenwriter's part to have it take place during Christmas, ensuring that it would become a perennial classic.It has been criticized, of course, for being full of clichés, but the fact is, no other action movie has handled those clichés as well as this one. It set the standard for action movies, and since then very few have even come close. ""Die Hard"" is a nonstop thrill, and all in all the most wildly entertaining movie I have ever seen. 10/10 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Die Hard-probably the best action film of all time,"I praise this movie just because it's a great action film. And it has great acting which makes it a classic. And so on. John McClane. After watching this movie, that's a person you would like to become. It starts with John McClane flying into California to see his wife in a tall forty-story skyscraper. He's a New York cop, and of course he's confused and disgusted with the California mood and humor. Then the terrorists arrive. Coincidence that it's the same night John McClane has arrived. John sneaks out unnoticed and tries to save all the Californian hostages and his wife from the death-threatening terrorists. He's a cop, so he has skill. Another good thing about this movie is that most of it is believable. Some can disagree, but for the most part, it's pretty realistic. Die Hard is both violent, which is good for this film, has lots of cursing, which some people can find unnecessary, but I think it's great, and the movie is sometimes humorous.

Bruce Willis and explosions keep the film afloat while everything else drags it down,"Before 1988, Bruce Willis was only known for the comedy TV series Moonlighting. Then Die Hard came out and be became one of the biggest action stars in the world. Everybody remembers his character, John McClane, as he battles terrorists with only his wits as a police officer. Apart from comedic roles from time to time, Willis hasn't looked back since, and really, why does he need to? He's the main reason the movie works at all since the rest of it falls apart and feels just as generic as every other 80's macho action film.The film opens on Christmas Day as New York police officer John McClane has just flown into Los Angeles to meet his wife and kids for the holidays. He's been separated from them since his wife took a high-end job at Nakatomi Corporation. John meets her at the office Christmas party, which takes place on a very high floor. Once he arrives, German terrorists crash the party in order to steal millions in negotiable bonds held by the president of Nakatomi. With the building shut down by the terrorists and the employees being held as hostages, John must now use his police skills by himself in order to save the day.Just like most 80's action movies, the plot is very straightforward and unfolds almost like a game of cat and mouse between John and his pursuers. This allows for multiple firefights and stunts to go down which results in a high body count and property damage. The film is great when the action is going on, but during slower times is when things start to deteriorate quickly. Apart from Willis and Alan Rickman, every character is pretty useless and doesn't have any valuable features. The film is also bogged down by its excessive 132-minute runtime that could have easily been shaven down considerably. There are side plots involving a news reporter, a hip limousine driver, and two take-no-prisoners FBI agents that seem to go on forever and end absolutely nowhere.Die Hard excels in the technical categories such as gun fighting, explosions, and stunts. There's plenty of blood and bullets sprayed around the office as each floor acts as a mini guerilla war zone. The explosions are authentically done (they were done for real) and are impressive to watch thirty years later. The stunt involving McClane with a fire hose jumping off of the building is a great action cinematic moment that, like the explosions, still holds up years later.Willis delivers perfectly as the lowly police officer that is out of his league. He gives great one-liners and plays himself as a modern cowboy that shoots first and asks later. Alan Rickman is surprisingly great in his first ever screen role. His character, Hans Gruber, could easily have been over the top and silly, but Rickman's balanced performance makes his character feel realistically calculated and cinematically evil. He's practically the perfect villain for an 80's action film.The acting and characters get really bad once you move past the two leads. Some characters are just not interesting enough, such as John's wife. Some eat up too much screen time for what little they bring, such as the lone police officer who talks to John and the limousine driver. And then are some characters that are totally useless and idiotic beyond belief, such as the deputy chief, FBI agents, and news reporter. These latter characters really bring the film down and made me shake my head every time I saw or heard them on screen.Even though it is overlong and has several pointless characters, Die Hard has two essential things going for it: Bruce Willis and explosions. Just as a pure film, Die Hard is passable, but as an over the top action film, it excels.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
The best quality,Die Hard is one of many action films made in the 1980s. Part of them weren't very good but some are real classics. This first Die Hard movie is one of those classics. Other Die Hard movies aren't as good as the first though I think Die Hard 3 and 4 are very good too. Before Die Hard series Bruce Willis was just a television actor. John McTiernan is the director of the movie.On Christmas Eve John McClane (Willis) who is a police from New York comes to Los Angeles to meet his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) who works for the Nakatomi Corporation. The company is holding a party at Nakatomi Plaza where Holly is invited too. Soon after John and Holly has argued Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) who is a West German former political radical and his armed henchmen take control of the building. They are going to steal 640 million dollars.The movie is very exciting. The chemistry between the main characters John McClane and Hans Gruber is the most important thing why Die Hard is so good movie. McClane is a traditional hero character who opposes crime. Willis brings much rough charisma to his character. McClane's sense of humour is also very ruthless. Gruber is a manipulative criminal and mastermind. He is very cool and insensitive man. Rickman was even better as Gruber than Willis as McClane. His role work is of the highest quality. Gruber's very violent henchman Karl is totally crazy guy and memorable character. Gruber is maybe the best movie villain ever. The Plot isn't too simple. I think action scenes are more credible because computers and special effects don't play a big role in the movie.In my opinion Die Hard is best action movie ever. 10/10.,10.0,Anonymous,Action
great movie from 80's!,"At the end of the Eighties the action movie genre, which had flourished throughout the decade, began to stagnate. Cinema goers had seen enough explosions and gunfights cloned from the same formula made popular by Arnie and Sly. Both of these men were moving in the direction of comedy and action movies needed something new.. something fresh. In stepped John McTiernan and Bruce Willis with DIE HARD. Willis, most famous at the time for the comic T.V. Series 'Moonlighting', made a perfect ordinary-man-in-an-extraordinary-situation action hero. He was believable as John McClane and not immune to being hurt. He bleed and felt pain, a first for the genre. And yet his cool confident delivery of a great wisecracking, intelligent script made him all the cooler. But most credit should go to Director John McTiernan, king of the sophisticated action flick. He made action movies slick, smart and full of pace and wit while never letting up on the bullets, cars and bombs front. Special praise must go out to Alan Rickman too whose performance as chief baddie Hans is to this day one of cinemas finest, moving convincingly from cool, calm and collected to desperate and nervous, never once seeming anything less than utterly ruthless and calculating. Die Hard is a great movie for a number of reasons but adding three dimensions to the action genre is this films finest achievement and anyone who has not sampled its delights before now would be wise to get a copy as soon as possible. But don't see it on T.V. oh no, because it is never without significant and completely unnecessary extra editing for violence and language. Enjoy it on video or DVD if you can, see it in all its original splendor, it is arguably the greatest action film ever made. And then go see the sequels.. they rock too!",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Archetype of the action genre,"Undeniably, the movie was a precursor, setting the tone for the blockbuster genre we all know today, but it is still hard to understand how Die Hard is such highly considered when there is so much to say.The movie gathers all the heaviest clichés of the genre: the bad guys are foreigners (why ?) and more dumb one from another, but the good guy is invincible and manages to kill everyone quite easily, the dialogues are often ridiculous, the situations sometimes far-fetched, the characters ultra stereotyped... and the list goes on.Everything isn't to be thrown out though: Alan Rickman is particularly interesting in the role of the cynical leader, and one could also note the effective cinematography. But it's just not enough to raise the bar of this caricatural, pretty long -the second part seems endless- and quite jerky movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Action
The Height of 80s Action,"""Die Hard"" has inspired countless replicas in the decades that have passed since its release. Everything from ""Air Force One"" (""Die Hard on a Plane"") to ""Speed"" (""Die Hard on a Bus"") throughout the 90s and early 2000s drew near direct inspiration from the film.Aside from its influence and near immortal status as to how to create an almost infinitely rewatchable popcorn movie, ""Die Hard"" earns its credit from me for its pacing. The slow buildup of the terrorist takeover, the realization of the outside world of what's going on in the Nakatomi Building, and John McClane (Bruce Willis) slowly taking out bad guys as he unravels the true intentions of the terrorist group.Special props to the cinematography (love the use of Dutch angles in this one) and also the incredible performance of Alan Rickman as the slimy Hans Gruber.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
A Classic,"Die Hard is the film that re-wrote the action genre, sparked countless copycat flicks (all of them inferior) and signalled the beginning of the slow, terminal decline of the careers of Messrs Schwarzenegger and Stallone (and the somewhat faster dive into obscurity of the likes of van Damme, Dudikoff, etc). The film holds up surprisingly well, despite all those copies. It should be showing its age, but it doesn't, and the subtext of average working joe threatened by  and fighting back against  faceless multinational corporations (legal or otherwise) is still relevant today. Looking through the principal players, the fact that neither the director, the writer or the star has since achieved such giddy heights suggests that this film was one of those fortunate accidents: everything clicked, and we were somehow given a classic in a genre that throws up precious few. This is the kind of film that's easy to dip into  but nearly impossible to tear yourself away from once you have.",8.0,Anonymous,Action

"Still pretty entertaining, but hardly a white knuckler.","6 out of 10Die Hard's plot has pretty much been the springboard for the action movies we see nowadays.  Basically, a group of terrorists hold lots of civiliant hostage so they can steal some money.  The premise has been done over and over and more elaborately than Die Hard, which uses the simplicity to its advantage.  It's one cop vs. a dozen terrorists, nothing particularly hard on the noggin about that.  While the action scenes are well executed, the movie is constantly shot in darkly lit areas, making some of the shootouts and fistfights harder to make out.But most damning of all is the fact that, off the top of my head, I cannot recall a big-studio action film that featured as many annoying supporting characters as the number in this movie.  There are the by-the-book FBI agents, the idiotic police captain (who, when hearing of a body being thrown at a building, actually suggests it may have been a guy who committed suicide), the drug-addled businessman who's out to save his own skin, and the cutthroat, no-mercy reporter who tries exploiting the story even at the risk of the hostages' lives.  It's hard to concentrate on the action when all I can think of is how each of these characters' is going to get his comeuppance.  It's also pretty insulting to see each of these people act stupid only to drive the plot forward.",,Anonymous,Action

A Seminal Action Film for 'Die-Hard' Genre Fans!,"Die Hard is an action picture with a capital 'A'. In fact, you might as well go ahead and capitalize the whole darn word. It's an expertly constructed machine for mayhem - a relentlessly thrilling, masterfully executed action film that turns up all the knobs and sets the standard for all of the American films made in the genre.To begin with, it's the classic plot hook of one man against many, right against wrong - a sweaty, bare-chested, all-American hero who battles a band of swarthy, heavily accented terrorist villains. But Die Hard is more layered than your average action movie. It is Christmas Eve. John McClane (Bruce Willis), a New York cop, is in town to spend the holidays with his kids and to fashion a reconciliation with his estranged wife Holly, who works for the Los Angeles branch of Nakatomi Corporation. Planning a rather different holiday agenda are the terrorists led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman). The dastardly dozen invade the plush 30th floor offices of Nakatomi during its Christmas party, and hold the employees hostage as a computer whiz cracks a code that will put our bad guys in possession of $600 million in negotiable bonds. McClane's in the john when the bad guys arrive, and he manages to slip away into the bowels of the building with nothing but his handgun, where he becomes the fly in the ointment of the criminals' plans. As the FBI helplessly marshals its forces outside, it's up to McClane to carry on the battle from within. McClane must scrap his way through the mêlée, free the hostages, and in the process repair his troubled marriage. Shirtless and barefoot, McClane swings through elevator shafts, clambers up heating ducts and creeps across rooftops as he tries to pick off the bad guys one by one.There's something satisfyingly claustrophobic about the premise, and the movie makers fully realize it's potential. Director John McTiernan works here with a clever script that offers ample opportunity for violence that is mind-boggling without being mindless. He composes the action cleanly and logically allowing the proceedings to acquire a sense of scale that can't help but impress. The film always looks gorgeous, and it never stops being exhilarating.At the center of this whirlwind of a movie is Bruce Willis, who blends the vulnerability - normally unseen in action film heroes - deftly with the requisite superhuman feats. He almost burns the screen with his overwhelming charisma, his wicked sense of humor and his big-balled bravado. He ensures McClane remains human and relatable, even as the bodies pile up around him. The rogues in the movie pitch in equally commendable performances, particularly Alan Rickman. Smarmy yet charismatic, Rickman adds a theatrical flourish to his performance which only makes him more menacing.Sleekly engineered, impeccably staged and shrewdly dosed with humor and sentiment, Die Hard manages to be heart-pounding and teeth- gritting every single time. Yippy-Ki-Yay!",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Remarkably Good Movie in Nearly Every Way,"""Die Hard"" is an ingenious marathon of claustrophobic and acrophobic action. It features superior action, a script sparkling with great lines, stalwart characters in the three biggest roles, high-quality sets, and a neat Michael Kamen musical score. The greatly successful careers of Alan Rickman and Bruce Willis can be traced to ""Die Hard."" Sadly, one recurring mistake prevents it from reaching its awesome potential and ruined the movie for me my first several viewings.Nearly the whole movie occurs at Nakatomi Plaza, a beautiful property with a skyscraper at its center. On the 30th floor, an innocent Christmas Eve party morphs into chaos upon the arrival of Hans Gruber (Rickman) and his twelve-man squad. While posing as a terrorist taking hostages, the wily Hans really seeks the treasure in Nakatomi's vault. Mr. Gruber has planned one of the truly perfect crimes, except for the one element nobody could have predicted.Holly McClane (Bonnie Bedelia), who is Nakatomi Corporation's Vice President, has invited her husband John (Willis) to the Christmas party. John is not merely a police officer, but one with exceptional skill and toughness. The terrorists cannot take control of the people quickly enough to prevent McClane's retreat to the unfinished upper floors. With John now roaming in the building, Hans's criminal master plan goes from flawless to critically endangered.I cannot say much about the action that has not already been said. It is great, no question. Some Arnold Schwarzenegger movies of the time contain more brutal violence. I prefer Indiana Jones or Timothy Dalton's Bond movies for quality, but any superiority those movies have is small. Fans of automatic weapons in movies have plenty to feast on here. Few people know the name Charlie Picerni, who was a stunt coordinator for several famous television shows before working ""Die Hard."" His effort here deserves special mention, as does cinematographer Jan de Bont's. It is no surprise that their careers have been successful since.LAPD Detective Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson) joins McClane and Gruber in the trio of main characters. All three rise above the level of average hero, supporter, and villain. ""Die Hard"" wisely takes pauses from the tense moments to let those three characters rule the movie for awhile. One of the movie's best scenes comes when McClane tearfully admits to Powell that he regrets never saying the words ""I'm sorry"" to his wife. Michael Kamen effectively tones down his memorable and often grandiose musical score to fit these scenes.With all of the high praise given so far, and ""Die Hard"" deserves every word of it, there is one huge problem. It is called Idiot Plot Syndrome. Roger Ebert is known for using it, although he did not coin the term. When a plot has easily solved problems but they take way too long to solve because most of the characters are idiots, the movie is infected with Idiot Plot Syndrome.""Die Hard"" puts on an idiots' convention. Let's consider Idiot Number One. McClane plans to lure the police to Nakatomi Plaza any way he can. With the phone lines cut, he uses a radio to report the hostage takeover. The brilliant 911 dispatcher completely ignores the report of terrorists with military weapons because she prefers to argue that the channel is reserved for emergency calls. Even machine gun fire loud enough to hurt her ears is not enough to punch reality through her lead skull into her stubborn brain.The police eventually arrive, and with them Deputy Chief Dwayne T. Robinson (Paul Gleason). Robinson readily accepts every possible explanation except the real one. His stupidity is not too bad at first, and actually plays a critical role in advancing the plot. It becomes annoying when he sees what is really happening and fails to wise up. He even hates McClane after he saves the lives of multiple officers because he does not like how he did it. Even worse are Johnson and Johnson from the FBI. If FBI agents honestly think losing 25% of a group of hostages is acceptable, I want to change countries. Then there is the coke snorting brownnoser who works with Holly, turkey television reporter (William Atherton), and the hack doctor who describes ""Helsinki Syndrome"" on the evening news. I could go on.When I saw ""Die Hard"" the first time, I had no idea if the movie was supposed to be a rousing action thriller, and action comedy, or a parody. The action is too hard hitting to be absurd, but the supporting characters are too goofy to be taken seriously. As a result, I did not enjoy the movie as an action or a comedy. I was confused and annoyed. I ended up frustrated with a movie I should have loved. Without Idiot Plot Syndrome and the misplaced humor it brings, ""Die Hard"" would certainly rate an eight of ten, and probably a nine. As it stands, six out of ten is all I can fairly award it.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
Over rated American Action Fodder,"I saw this many years ago and thought it was a poor film then. I thought it worth re-watching given its status as a 'great action Christmas movie'.My verdict has not changed over time. 5 out of 10 is quite generous as a film rating, it could be. 7/10 as an action film of its time.Bruce Willis is never convincing as the hero, the American cops as useless as ever, the terrorists are disorganised and although they hold up to 30 people captive they never seem to use this as leverage to get out of the building.The film lacks a decent plot and garners little sympathy for the captives or Bruce Willis who swaggers about with typical American bravado.

My brief review of the film,"A well-made action film with an excellent technical side, the somewhat convoluted plot takes a backseat to the action and thrills, yet the film still delivers its excitement well. The characters are quite run-of-the-mill, including a very typical hero, but at least Alan Rickman manages to bring a bit more to his character: something sly and mysterious. Paul Gleason's character is an annoyance and a waste, but he is fortunately not giving too much screen time. There is too much time though spent on useless supporting characters in general, and the messages about marriage and relationships are too obvious to be effective. Still, if not quite a masterpiece, this is energetic stuff, very good of its type, plus there are some moments of comic relief well worked in.",7.0,Anonymous,Action

Good action film,"Good action film. His John McClane is capable it seems of startling feats of death-defying derring-do, but at least he gets there from an inauspicious start when he initially seems terrified and clueless as to how to cope with the heist situation. He squares off well against smooth, metronomic, but sadistic Alan Rickman, in his first big movie role, as the robber's leader proves a good foil. The stunts are excellent, although the soundtrack and fashions have dated poorly. Nevertheless, the action steams ahead from almost the start and rarely lets up thereafter, Bruce working his way through what looks like a bunch of try-outs for 80's hairbands. At various points I picked up on Christmas in the background, even if the film as a whole has little to do with the traditional festive spirit.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Action

One of the few movies I've seen in a long time that was entertaining.,"I'm not someone who tries to find the good in every movie. People who do that just overrated cinema and praise movies that genuinely were a complete waste of their time. I think that is why I hate most action movies that have been released in the 2000s. With the exception of a handful, it's a common trend for modern action movies to be cliché paint-by-the-number dramas with a few things blowing up in the background. This modern mindset that action movies have to have cliché drama elements or they're somehow worthless is a misconception that I never understood. I'm an action fan. I came for action. I didn't come for an hour and a halfliterally, sometimesof the buff action hero giving long speeches about how much he loves his one-dimensional kid with cancer. In this sense, Die Hard makes the biggest, most recent action blockbusters look pathetic. I'm very happy to write that its main focus is action; the other lame storytelling elements are all expendable.With that said, Die Hard does something else I didn't expect. Something that no one gives it credit for. It's creative. If you look behind the terrorist plot, you'll see Die Hard doing things that no other action movie did before it. For one, it has the ""hero"" (who is really more of a pawn than a hero) completely in solitude for most of the movie. In a sense, Die Hard is almost a reverse slasher film. In slasher films the main bad guy kills people and he's never seen on screen until the ending. In Die Hard, the hero kills people and the bad guys have no clue who is doing it. Again, another thing no other action movie has had the creativity to do. Though the overall movie isn't anything entirely new (thus my somewhat low score), there are a hundred other details that make it far superior to the less creative action movies out there.Die Hard also has a hardcore level of intensity that I've seen in very few action movies. It builds on a semi-slow pace that immerses the viewer in realism and allows them to care for the characters. The fact Die Hard can do this without ever once becoming tedious or boring is another aspect movies have lost in modern times. The key is in that there is never once an expendable scene in Die Hard. Every scene adds something to the overall effect of the movie, and without it something would be lacking from the overall effect. In opposite, modern action films pump the movie full of pointless talking scenes and pointless sex scenes and pointless drama scenes that add nothing whatsoever to the overall effect of the movie. Also, Die Hard gives the viewer credit that we understood the plot from the first trailer and doesn't need to sit and explain it any further. Modern action films hardly ever do that. Most recently in The Dark Knight, we had to sit thought an hour and a half of nothing but people discussing the cliché crime plot that we understood in full before we even went into the theater.The directing is also far above average. Coming from the same man who directed Predator, I didn't expect anything less. The directing almost has an epic feel as the camera shows all the necessary rooms of the building without once showing something unnecessary to the overall effect. Again, a trait lost in modern action movies.Overall, this film is a necessary watch for anyone who calls themselves an action fan. It's not a perfect movie, and it's not something completely alien to everything that has been done before, but it's entertaining. I watch at least two movies a day, and I can't remember the last time I watched a movie that I found genuinely entertaining.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Action

Bruce Willis gives an excellent performance as McClane, the ordinary guy who has entered the wrong scenario at the right time. Alan Rickman made a terrifying villian, Hans Gouber. Bonnie Bedella was annoying but hysterical as a wiseacre ex-wife turned hostage. The direction by John McTieran (PREDATOR, THE LAST ACTION HERO) was not short of being superb and first class.DIE HARD is one action packed movie that offers thrills, excitement, and plenty of fast paced humor and wisecracks from Willis. The action is fast and furious, and the film pulls enough punches to keep the energy flowing! DIE HARD is simply one of the most cinematic action masterpieces ever. It is often a rarity to see such a white knuckle adventure that keeps you on the edge of the seat throughout the entire film. Bravo!",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Lean,"This gets better every Christmas and I predict no stop to it. It works so well I believe one day film students will be forced to study the effect beyond the cultural just like they now study Hawks and Hitchcock. Some groundwork here for future readings.Willis had charm of a similar sort to Wayne, empty swag and unable to act. The story derives from a western mentality anyway. We have a couple drifting apart and the situation that brings them close again, but this isn't really a main driving force in the story. Neither Willis nor his wife are directed to convey much anxiety about their reuniting, we can logically assume it but it's not a palpable tension in the film. The movie is his macho dream to destroy that corporate life that has taken his wife from him; the Japanese boss who he didn't prevent being shot, the annoying Ellis character who puzzlingly doesn't give him up as the husband, the whole building that he tears apart, Willis unclasping her rollex in the climax and with it corporate, money-driven Hans Gruber tumbles down.More interesting is that all this is wrapped in the usual Christmas fantasy about family, but for the fact that it's not the usual one. The usual one would begin after the movie ends as their kids who had gone to bed that night with an estranged father on the other side of the country wake up to find their parents together again. It's the same cinematic leanness that makes Christmas a faint background instead of bending every edge to it like most Christmas films do, probably inspired by the low-key approach of Lethal Weapon.This brings me to another point. It really has little action compared to what we have now in superhero stuff. Preparations take up much more screen time than gunplay. Of course at the time it didn't seem so, which is why now the effect is beginning to surface with some clarity. We don't need to have whole fabrics of world torn up for it to be intense, it derives from the situation and is punctuated by bursts of action in very clearly defined cinematic space. Up and down, in and out. Economic use of space. The rooftop climax is a great example, we don't have endless shooting and a storm of fractured image; McClane gets there fires a machinegun burst in the air, an explosion throws him off the edge, he smashes in through the windows below.Lethal Weapon was liberal, this is conservative. That one inspired by noir, this one by westerns. Briggs and Murtaugh are frayed and flummoxed in earnest by the world, McClane coolly stands above it, alone and charred only on the outside. What kind of guy are you?",,Anonymous,Action
"""Come out to the coast...get together...have a few laughs""","One of the most refined, stylish, and generally well executed action blockbusters of the 1980s, Die Hard has it all. John McTiernan's direction is smart and concise, and Alan Rickman delivers one of the most memorable villainous performances of the genre, the quintessential gentleman thief; he plays perfectly against Bruce Willis' macho swagger.The set design is fantastic, really making you feel like you are in a high-rise building and the music expertly builds and lowers tension.

Welcome to the party Pal!,"'Die Hard' is without a doubt the pinnacle of classic action films and a highlight of the 80s. There's only one name that terrorist fear; McClane!1. In a time when a new action star was needed, a young Bruce Willis rose to the challenge amidst the likes of Schwarzenegger and Stallone. Reluctantly on a trip to Los Angeles to meet his estranged wife (Bonnie Bedelia) and kids, John McClane (Bruce Willis) finds himself under the radar of a terrorist plot on Christmas Eve. Willis really was a breath of fresh air at the time of this film's release, considering no one knew what to expect since action stars of that era were damn near body-building types.2. As far as Willis is concerned, with every great hero...there must be a great villain to follow; enter Alan Rickman (Hans Gruber). Apart from '007' films, Rickman defined what a suave, intelligent and deadly antagonist can be. No matter how bad a villain is, it's equally fun to have a formidable henchman at his side, which (the late) Alexander Godunov (Karl) portrays with sheer brutality. However sad it was to hear of Rickman's passing, his legacy still lives on in his most memorable and career defining role as Hans Gruber.3. Behind a great action-flick like this, stood an exceptional director. John McTiernan proved his worth in the realm of action the previous year when he directed another cult and sci-fi classic; 'Predator'. It was clearly a no-brainer having him on board and in turn, McTiernan also went on to direct the third film in the franchise: 'Die Hard: With a Vengeance'. His directing style is obvious as can be since the action sequences are well maintained so that things never get derailed or too crazy.4. Reginald Vel Johnson and Paul Gleason round out the main cast, with memorable side characters as well that stand in as other terrorists and comic reliefs respectively. Willis himself adds more of the humor to the film when he finds himself in stressful situations as the film progresses. He just has a natural charm as McClane which no other action star has ever brought to a character before.To find things that don't work about this film is a hard task, cause I honestly can't think of anything. When spectacle meets action, that's when you'll know that old habits DIE HARD!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Action
The best action movie I've seen,"Now this is what action movies are all about. ""Die Hard"" stars Bruce Willis as New York officer John McClane, a cop who gets trapped in a high-rise in LA when terrorists come to steal a substantial sum from the building's safe. He single-handedly ends up defeating the entire team of terrorists. Although the film's action scenes are great (especially the classic one involving McClane jumping out of the building holding onto a fire hose), it is the interactions between McClane and Sergeant Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson) and villain Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) that make the movie what it really is. Rickman plays one of the greatest movie villains, as he combines evil with humor, as every villain should. His performance was Oscar-worthy, in my opinion. It's great dialogue and fun characters that set ""Die Hard"" apart from most other action movies. Its three sequels are all great too, but this film is still superior.

The Pinnacle of Action Films,"Action-packed, violent, explosive, funny and well-crafted, ""Die Hard"" elevated Action to a peak that set a standard which has been endlessly followed and has yet to be surpassed. The struggle and drama of police officer John McClane in his battle for justice and personal redemption is one of the great epics in the popular and controversial genre. Scaling and descending a high-rise edifice in flashy L. A. to save his estranged wife and a host of terrified hostages symbolizes perfectly the man's odyssey as he shoots, beats, kills and hurls while getting shot, sliced, beaten and punctured in return. Everything that should work in an Action flick is on display: on point action, a well written urban script, a complementary soundtrack, consistent good acting throughout and the able use of special effects. The film's flaws like its length, plot holes and already glaring pc fortunately barely detract from its overall fun and watchability. Hugely popular during its time elevating lead star Bruce Willis to the A-List and arguably the greatest Action film made, ""Die Hard"" is one of the rare bullseyes where artistic and commercial success are both equally deserved.

Space Nazis! (3),"A decent actioner that came in the late 80's, ""Die Hard"" shows an ""ex cop"" slugging it out with terrorists who, for some strange reason or another, make all appearances of being German, or rather a conglomerate of ethnically white Europeans, possibly a mix of Eastern Europe, but most certainly from some radical group, like the Nazi party. Ho hum. Maybe Hollywood can indoctrinate a new set of bad guys at some point in the future.The film itself is well executed, pretty campy here and there with lots of stunning pyrotechnics and plenty of gunfights and overall action. The acting isn't even half bad, or rather appropriate for the moments that appear in the film; high energy in some places, campy in others, comic book like in some other areas.You can't take it seriously on any level really.

The Perfect Action Movie!,"Die Hard, one of the greatest action movies of all time, still to this day, it's more impressive than ever. If you were to look in the dictionary and look up the word action, this movie would probably be shown, lol. My mom was just absolutely in love with this film and told me how much I should see it if I love action movies, also I had become a Bruce Willis fan, so when she mentioned that, I decided to sit down and watch it. It's not just Bruce Willis that makes this movie, although he does a fantastic job as the ultimate hero, his line delivery is always perfectly on cue and he's just such a cool guy that anyone could love. But for me it was Alan Rickman who truly steals the film, he is the ultimate bad guy and his voice was just so creepy, I love him. But all together the cast and special effects truly make this a memorable film for generations to come.John McClane is a police officer who has taken his career very seriously, a little too seriously since his wife is about to divorce him and he's about to loose his children. When John comes to see his wife, Holly, at her office building during the company Christmas party, he asks if he can be given a second chance, but that gets slightly interrupted when terrorists enter the building. Hans Gruber, the leader of the terrorists, wants 600 million dollars of bonds from the company's owner. But with John in the building, he's gonna have a hard time because John is on his case will make sure to give him a roller coaster of a crime bust.This is without a doubt the most exciting action movie since The Terminator. I love the whole idea of this taking place around Christmas, it just adds a little more dark humor. Especially the way that Alan Rickman says ""Now I have a machine gun. Ho...Ho...Ho"", it was just so perfect! I really love Die Hard, I am officially a fan, this is just the most awesome movie to watch. Believe me, it's that good, I highly recommend this movie for anyone, it's a lot of fun, I guarantee you that you will not be disappointed.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Sleigh Bells and Machine Guns Ring Are You Listening?,"I saw Die Hard three times when it came out and have watched it every Christmas since. What makes this action extravaganza a Christmas movie for me (other than the movie taking place on Christmas eve) I have no clue. It has to be the Jingle Bell sound effects, Christmas trees crashing in the lobby, or probably Bing Crosby singing 'Let It Snow' at the end. It has become my personal 'It's A Wonderful Life'. Anyway, enough with Christmas this movie is good, very good. Bruce Willis does one hell of a job as McClane. He has the physical look and street wise demeanor of a New York cop that makes his role deliver the movie just as much as Mel Gibson does for Lethal Weapon. And, one of the unconscious reasons I truly love this movie is that the terrorist aren't your run of the mill shoot'em up bad guys. They come across as smart sophisticated criminals who actually have a very good plan and aren't afraid to look you in the eye and shoot you without blinking. Alan Rickman the leader is a great villain. He comes complete with wit, snide remarks, and the always popular anti-American rhetoric. Another actor who does a great job holding up the movie is Reginald VelJohnson as Sargent Powell. His verbal battles with his boss are something that is encountered at offices across this great land everyday. Even the two FBI guys come complete with egos, good looking suits, and the names to match (great line that is usually missed by the normal viewer). As for action and sound it's an A+. That is a big reason I saw it three times. I knew it was going to be on video but I couldn't resist the explosions and glass sounds over and over. There are also sound bites and comedy that pops up and lets you release the tension. John McTiernan did great work setting up camera angles and shots that add to the excitement. Good examples is the shot in the air shaft (classic line included) and the shot from Powell's car as someone comes crashing down on it. You won't find to many better at delivering high paced action and all the trimmings that make this kind of movie a delight. A Christmas classic for years to come!!",8.0,Anonymous,Action

"Drugs, sex, cars? No, just McClain, his gun, and a whole lot of terrorists.","What can I say, this movie had me rooted to the spot. I couldn't even pause it to go to the bathroom, I had to hold it in. I can definitely say, I enjoyed this movie... a lot.It starts off with off-duty New York cop, John McClain (Bruce Willis), going to LA to spend Christmas with his family. He arrives and is driven to Nakatomi Plaza, the building where his wife works. However, his desired break turns into a no-holds barred action thriller when a group of terrorists take over the building holding thirty people hostage. There was only one person they didn't round up - McClain. It's now McClain's job to thwart these terrorists, save the hostages and save his wife.One of the most notable aspects of this movie is that fact that McClain isn't some 'super-cop'. He's just a normal guy with normal problems, he's slightly balding, having problems with his wife and doesn't have the best luck in the world. However, after watching to movie, you have to love him.And then there is Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman). He is only seen firing a gun twice throughout the full movie, but he still remains a guy you definitely don't want to cross. Rickman has done an excellent job here and this is definitely one of his career defining roles. These days he's known for playing 'Snape' from the Harry Potter film series. Before that, if you've heard of him, chances are it's from Die Hard.This movie contains a lot of action. Lot's of fighting; hand to hand, with guns, and even explosives. But for some reason it isn't too over- the-top. Although the amount of violence is very high it never becomes so unbelievable that you could mistake it for Batman. Okay, the scene where Bruce Willis jumps off the building and crashes back in through the window several floors down isn't likely. But it is possible and it does make you sit there watching the movie with your mouth open in amazement.Personally, I find I can relate to McClain. Okay, maybe not all the action, but his comments and the way everything doesn't go right for him in life. That makes me relate to it and that fact I loved!If you're a fan of action/crime movies and you haven't seen this then I'll be surprised... And I'll also tell you to get out right now, buy it on DVD, and watch it ASAP! This is a movie you WON'T regret watching. And if you're a true action fan, you'll agree.",,Anonymous,Action

One of the Greatest Raw Action Movies Ever Made,"""Die Hard"" is arguably one of the best action films in its genre of alltime.It is a movie that stays with you long after you have finished watching it. The characters played by Bruce Willis (John McClane), Bonnie Bedelia (Holly Gennaro McClane), Alan Rickman (Hans Gruber), James Shigeta (Joseph Yoshinoba Takagi), and Reginald VelJohnson (Sgt. Al Powell) are all unforgettable characters that you feel you know intimately after viewing this film.The plot of the movie revolves around John McClane saving a building full of hostages, along with a more personal motive of saving his estranged wife who is among the hostages. John McClane is New York cop who travels to the West Coast to join his wife and children for the Christmas Holiday. He goes to her place of employment and while he is there, the building is taken over by German terrorist. John is able to slip through the cracks and not be detected by the terrorists. He is then able to spend the rest of the evening killing the terrorists one by one until he finally reaches the leader Hans Gruber in the ending climax. John McClane saves the hostages and his wife in the end.Like the Indiana Jones movies, Die Hard takes intense action and mixes it with a bit of humor to appease different aspects of the movie watching experience. The director and editors did an amazing job with their use of angles and filming to create scenes that give a feeling of enormity and suspense. One example of this is a scene on the roof of Nakatomi Plaza when John McClane is trying to get the hostages to abandon the roof for the safety of lower floors, because he knows the roof is wired with explosives. The angle is taken from above and a little to the left of the overall scene. In the scene you are able to view the hostages, John McClane, and the FBI closing in with their helicopters.Another example is when John McClane reacts to Hans Gruber killing the character of Harry Ellis. McClane takes explosives attached to a rolling chair with a computer monitor on top and drops it down an elevator shaft causing an enormous explosion.The angle used for this scene pans out to include the whole Nakatomi Plaza along with part of the police force. The enormity of the scene is felt through the editing and angle of filming.""Die Hard"" takes the theme of good vs. evil and packs it into a highly raw action film that uses regular people to accomplish the impossible. It takes an everyday average New York Cop and turns him into one of the biggest heroes in the action movie genre.",10.0,Anonymous,Action

Setting the standards,"Die Hard and its sequels set some kind of standard for good action with minimum logical leaps.

I am too old for this kind of thing,"Tower buildings have few entrances relative to the space they provide; moreover, hights are always thrilling: they allow people falling to death or being thrown off the roof, offer the chance to show a helicopter landing on top of them and so on. They are therefore well suited for action or disaster films: remember 'The Towering Inferno' of 1974. 'Die Hard' has become a classic of the genre. This is despite the ludicrous storyline that defies belief and the cardboard characters that could have been adapted from a comic book. Moreover, the picture plays to a large number of popular prejudices, most obviously to the idea that 'the state' (here represented by the police and FBI) is useless, if not dangerous, and that real problems are being solved by loners acting on their own initiative. The loner in question (Bruce Willis) goes through all kinds of implausible dangers to emerge battered but victorious; moreover, like in all films aimed at an audience of male teenagers, he gets the girl. His antagonists are of course foreigners: In this case West German terrorists turned robbers who speak with a ridiculous fake German accent. Their leader Hans Gruber (horribly overacted by Alan Rickman in one of his cheesiest roles) cannot even pronounce his own name (he says something like 'Grubber'). In sum, the film is not much more than a mindless series of explosions and shootings interspersed with dialogue and oneliners that are intended to be funny. A waste of time.",3.0,Anonymous,Action
An Amazing Action Movie!,This is one of the first movies I grew up watching. This movie gives me a feeling of my young days. I love watching Bruce doing these wonderful action. When I watched this movie for the first time I was a little girl. Only knew Bruce Lee and Terminator (Not even Arnold Schwarzenegger's name.). John gave me goosebumps and a real hero feelings. I love Die Hard as much as I love watching movies. I still watch Die Hard with the same eagerness in my eyes and heart. A film of my young heart!,10.0,Anonymous,Action
High Thrills and Hard to Kill,"One of the things I love about action films is just like with the suspense thrillers it plays with all the what ifs, where something that most likely wouldn't happen or are considered unthinkable does and from this two questions are asked, ""if ever put under the spot how would we deal with the situation?"" and ""is it possible to survive and win?""This film is one of my favorite movies of all time, but also, it's my second favorite action film of all time. And of course, one of my favorite Christmas movies. I remember seeing this when I was an adolescent it blew me away, even today I still have lots of fun watching. Heck, even watching the trailer for this film is lots of fun, with that music going on and hearing some of that narrative from the late great Don Lamonte, he always had that great voice for ad narration and is something I sorely miss in trailers.And this film wasn't just another 80's action film it was a phenomenon where this film has established itself as a subgenre in the action genre as many other films throughout the year and TV episodes have utilized the format like the movie ""Under Siege"" and the underrated ""Toy Soldiers"" but that's and many others are different stories. Even has a few video games, two of them are good like ""Die Hard Trilogy"" for PS1 and ""Die Hard Arcade"". There were even two pre sequel comics from Boom Studios based on John McClane that are surprisingly good. And even most recently a tabletop game that is cool.I really love the plotline; from the way it's conducted it feels plausible; who's to say it can't happen or no criminal organization has every had this in the back of their minds.The characters are great there are a lot of colorful characters.Karl played by late and underrated actor Alexander Godunov whom is a solid subordinate villain as he is just throughout the film from beginning to end, hellbent in liquidating McClane. It's just interesting how as the film gets further along the more this guy's cool and sanity is just melting faster than the polar ice caps.And of course, the late great Alan Rickman one of my favorite actors is great as Hans Gruber, this is one of my favorite roles from him and he's an honorable mention in favorite fictional villains. The Hans Gruber character isn't really a deep character as he's more of an archetypal villain but I think it was really in Alan's performance that makes him stand out, from the sharp German accent that you feel ever word could almost cut you like a knife.He's a villain that is just constantly in control, much like a chess player he is a step or two ahead as he already has an elaborate plan in action. But he's very cold, calculating, and ruthless he isn't afraid to off anybody that gets in the way or tries to ruin his scheme. But also the guy has a dry charisma which means he's got some memorable lines and humor but in a different way, one line that makes me snicker is ""I read about them in Time magazine."" , I know small line but once you see the scene you'll know why it's funny.Supporting characters are good like Officer Dwight whom is played by the late and underrated actor Paul Gleason. He's is someone you just love to dislike as he is pretty much that stereotypical jerk police chief whom we see is constantly trying to oversee the situation but it really not in charge of jack squat. What's funny about him is that he's practically a moron, but I do like that he at least tries to help despite not good at it.And there is of course Sergeant Al Powell played well by Reginald VelJohnson, whom I always call the character Carl Winslow as that is that actors signature character from the TV show ""Family Matters"" as both characters are kind of the same. Anyway, really like how he really provides support for John by keeping him up to date on what's going on the ground as well as provide some intelligence from John about the perpetrators. But just like the back and forth between both of them which is touching and gives the film the buddy cop element, but here it's different because it's a long distance friendship; I thought that was cool because it's something different that don't see in that sub-genre.But of course, it's the protagonist himself we love and are here for. Bruce Willis whom is an honorable mention in favorite actors in my book is great as John McClane, this is my favorite role from him, it's practically his signature role and John is sort of an honorable mention in favorite fictional heroes.At the time he wasn't your typical or conventional action hero as he wasn't a man of muscle or not much muscle, let alone had the greatest set of fighting skills but that's part of why this action hero is great is because he's you everyday guy which made him somewhat relatable and shows how you don't have to be a man of muscle to kick ass.One of the things this action hero has going for him is his sharp, witty, wise cracking charisma; this character just has lots of funny and memorable lines; he's much like Deadpool as he just keeps the jokes and lines coming. This in a way really helps in keeping his cool as well as being able to think straight under a highly stressful situation.I even like how human the guy is as we get some depth into him, as we see his marriage is on the rocks and he's aware that he's not perfect that part of the reason is he fraked up a little, but he really does want to make things better you can say this situation was one hell of a way to do it. I also just like how he reacts to things which feel like how any ordinary person would react, really like how at times he talks to himself to help himself think, in those scenes the film is almost a one man show, one of my favorite quotes is ""Think God Damnit Think."" Yeah that what I always say whenever I have a certain dilemma I have to deal with.Also, you see in some places how tired and slightly irritated mannerism as you can tell half the time he's thinking ""I don't want to do this, I really don't."", he didn't ask nor want to put himself in the action hero position as all he really wanted to do was the simplest thing spending Christmas with his family. But he has no choice so he pretty much rolls his eyes and goes with the role as no one else can do it, let alone his life and many others depend on it.The action is well choregraphed, I like that it doesn't look too smooth which makes the film a bit realistic if you can believe that. You have some solid shootouts in the building like one that involves probably the biggest boardroom meeting table I've ever seen, which is kind of funny as it seems big enough to fit Congress. As well as a one on one fight which is one of my favorite one on ones of all time as both Karl and John are going at it, I liked the way it was done because it really felt realistic as it looked like real fighting. As a real fight wouldn't be perfectly choregraphed and there are no rules involved as both are fighting dirty.And of course, the effects are great like the explosion which are practical there's no CGI bullcrap which makes them look beautiful. My favorite is of course the explosion of the third floor, when I saw, word will fail to describe this as you have to see it for yourself but seeing it, I thought ""Wow, John you nuked the building.""Music is also great, there are plenty of memorable scores which create excitement and suspense. Even like the use of one famous Christmas song from Dean Martin in the end credits ""Let it Snow"" every time I hear that song, I can't help but think of this film.What also makes this action film unique is the suspense from the physical situations of going from point A to B, surviving the firefights, and close calls in places that really put me on the edge of my seat.But also, double layered and clever in what is revealed to us and not revealed. Where on one hand you are sometimes in the robber's shoes as you actually do want them to open that vault, but seeing their perspective actually helps make us at times part of the action because we actually are one step ahead of the protagonist. And the suspense is hopping the protagonist will be able to catch up on time, get a step ahead but also help fill in a blank or two because despite knowing most of Han's plans there is one part of it, we still don't understand.Also, it's not just physical warfare but it's also a war of wits. Both John and Hans are both smart people, Han's heist plan and methodology is fool proof but the problem with him and the robbers is their thinking is inflexible and rigid because they never counted on an anomaly in the plan. John his intelligence might not be on the same level as Hans, as Hans stated he's had the finest education but good enough, because the thing about John is that his thinking is unorthodox, he is able to improvise and think on his feet literally.Die Hard will blow you away and Merry Christmas.Rating: 4 stars",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Loved it!,"Okay, okay. By now everyone has already seen this film, if not once, twice and if you haven't, you should! Willis stars in this first of several ""Die Hard"" movies, where New York cop, John McClane must battle terrorists against all odds. In this movie, he must do it in an L.A. high-rise, with the lives of his wife and her co-workers at stake. Willis is perfect in this role, battling the bad guys while adding his own sort of sarcastic humor and yes, charm, to the situation. Rickman is perfectly evil as the leader of the bad guys, and the action is entertaining and exciting, instead of graphic and gratuitous as in so many films today. Sit back, settle in and enjoy this high-energy, action film!",9.0,Anonymous,Action
"Die Hard has well-defined characters, human frailties wonderfully inserted in the context of the narrative, an unforgettable performance by Willis and great action sequences","In the midst of so many copies of the action genre of the 1980s, Die Hard was born, based on a 1970 novel by writer Roderick Thorp entitled Nothing Lasts Forever. This first adventure by police officer John McClane became one of the great references of the genre. The rules of action cinema in Hollywood have been rewritten and experienced a welcome evolution in the three decades that followed the explosion of Die Hard. At first glance, Die Hard can be seen superficially as a film of an invincible army man, who ends up alone with a catastrophic terrorist assault that involves millions of dollars, a lot of shooting, blood and death. But the work of the ever underestimated John McTiernan is much more profound, referential and iconic than this.John McClane (Bruce Willis) is a New York detective who is going to Los Angeles to meet his wife (Bonnie Bedelia), who works at a Japanese company. However, upon arriving at the building where she works, he realizes that the building is being assaulted by a band of terrorists and decides to disrupt his plans to rescue his wife.One of the great differences of the script of Jeb Stuart and Steven E. de Souza was to bring in John McClane a hero of different action. Unlike the ""superheroes"" who used to save the day badly by sweating their shirts, the policeman in the wrong place at the right time was a normal guy, without special training, without muscles, who runs, sweats, bleeds, despairs and he is very lucky to get to the end of the day. McClane, on the other hand, was not as realistic as Popeye Doyle, who gave Oscar to Gene Hackman in Operation France, there was no subtext to the character beyond what is explicit on the scene. The studio, in turn, wanted to bet more on the action and concept of the film than on its protagonist. Die Hard looked like an anomaly, and in the end, Bruce Willis won his first big role. Willis' casting was a great success, given the need to find a delicate balance between an invincible policeman and a human being like any other, with whom the viewer can reasonably identify.The script is very skillful in not only building McClane's character by avoiding expository texts or long sequences that precede the action itself, but also in pacing the narrative in a logical crescendo, so much so that McClane does not delay. partnership with a brave local common policeman (Al Powell, played by the friendly Reginald VelJohnson) with whom he communicates via radio, as well as on the side of the villain Hans Gruber, with shady purposes that only make the plot more palatable. Everything we need to know about the protagonist we learned in the initial ten minutes of the projection, the only ones really calm in the work and what we see, from there, is a well-connected succession of risk situations behind risk situations that, however, do not they create sensory overdoses and do not necessarily have that obsessive Hollywood tendency to turn the next scene into something grander or noisier than the previous one.The $28 million lean budget was offset by the sweat of McTiernan's team and the brilliant work of producers Lawrence Gordon and Joel Silver. Production started with the concept of the unfinished film. Scenarios were still being built and the ending was being discussed when McTiernan and his team stormed Fox's own Los Angeles headquarters, alongside the company's studios in Century City, to house production. The building was still being completed, and much of what we see in the film was shot on location, including the unfinished floors. The original concepts were changed by the director. He traded terrorists in the original film for thieves in search of the millions kept in the building's vault, who pretended to be terrorists as part of the plan. The action, extended over three days in the original text, was condensed into a single night, Christmas Eve.It is also the director's merit to make the most of the extremely detailed production design for each floor of the building under attack that leaves nothing to owe to what we see in Hell in the Tower. Using the setting as an inextricable part of the narrative just as he did with the rainforest surrounding Dutch and his companions in The Predator, McTiernan, along with the photograph of Jan de Bont (well before venturing into the director's chair at full speed) gives life to inanimate objects, to the grand but functional sets and to the Nakatomi Plaza itself, transforming them into real characters in the plot. The soundtrack of the prolific Michael Kamen, who specializes in action films, is loaded with functional elements that aim to amplify the suspense in the film, but without drawing attention to itself with leit motifs of characters or other artifices of the genre.
The first thing that is noticeably obvious in Die Hard is his little affair with men seen as important by the societies that surround them. While Alan Rickman's Hans, the leader in front of the terrorists, is cold, calculating and feared, you can see how everyone else is treated with disdain, as if history made a point of dismissing them. Who is the first to die? The president of the company, the highest ranking man among all hostages. What about the FBI agents? Seen with trembling eyes by the majority of criminals in police films, they appear here in a tragicomic way, entitled to uncontrolled laughter and actions incompatible with the status of their credentials.What about the thug who tries to quote (High Noon, 1952), but misses Gary Cooper's name as Grace Kelly's partner? McClane corrects him. He is right, he knows what he is doing, he knows the comparison, his opponent does not, and that puts him at a psychological advantage, even though he is obviously at a logical disadvantage - one barefoot pistol, the maximum of primitivism, against automatic and a much larger number of enemies.In 1988, when the film was produced, women still had little space in the financial market. As a Working Girl, 1988 explored, it was Hard for a tough, macho and imperfect policeman to accept that his wife was in a more favorable professional position than he was. McClane is like that, just human, of mistakes and successes. He appears to be the politically incorrect protagonist, who mercilessly kills his opponents while smoking, but is just an orderly being who tries to do what is right for his family in an extraordinary situation. Despite the fight, both he and his wife keep pictures of each other in their wallet, at the work table .... They split up, but their story together is far from over.John McClane knows that the roof of the skyscraper that houses the powerful Nakatomi Corporation is lined with explosives. Barefoot, bleeding and alone, he goes up to the helipad and, firing his machine gun into the air, forces the hostages down, saving everyone from certain death. FBI agents in a helicopter shoot McClane, taking him for a terrorist. The clock is ticking. He runs away from the bullets, ties a fire hose around his waist and, already in the sight of one of the agents, jumps off the roof, which explodes on his back.... Your words before the ocean of fire projected on your body? ""I swear I'll never be in a tall building again."" And so it was, reaching its bombastic climax, that Die Hard showed the world the primer on how to build an action movie. This is, without a doubt, has well-defined characters, human frailties wonderfully inserted in the context of the narrative, an unforgettable performance by Willis and action sequences that would establish a new level for the genre for the following decades, the work is, one of the best action movies already made.Between explosions of convincing mechanical special effects and shots that destroy legs and organs without the slightest subtlety (imagine the film being made today), there is a story of love and optimistic overcoming past traumas - in this sense, there is a secondary character of a police officer important to McClane's psychological maintenance. The film is courageous, authentic, has a voice of its own and an action that convinces the casual and Hardcores of cinema: it is one of the best representatives of the genre available on the market. Die Hard had a great critical return, receiving four Oscar nominations and awards around the world. A great diversion that went much more well than expected, showing that ironic heartthrobs could also be good heroes of action, strengthening the identification with the viewer, who cheered at the end of the chair for the inevitable happy ending. Success that continues today.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Thrilling action ride,"Despite being released 30 and a half years ago, I never saw Die Hard until last night. I have zero regrets whatsoever about watching it, and got quite a kick observing how movies like White House Down and Skyscraper borrow from it. I WON'T touch on the stupid argument over whether or not Die Hard is a Christmas movie.It's Christmas Eve. NYPD officer John McClane (Bruce Willis) arrives in LA to see his estranged wife and kids. As he waits for the Christmas party at his wife's workplace to finish, a group of terrorists led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) quickly take over the building and take the guests as hostages. McClane, however, manages to evade the crims without them realising he exists. The crooks are after the business owner's bonds - worth quite a lot of money - and murder him after he refuses to give them the codes to the vault. McClane must try and alert the authorities and at the same time stay one step ahead of the crooks - and kill/defeat them.It's a highly fun and exciting action movie. Be warned that it's rather violent with a LOT of swearing (especially the F word) & is NOT suitable for (pre-teen) children. Some might consider the early parts of the movie scary. I love the tension and even the occasional humour in the movie. As mentioned, it was highly amusing spotting where Roland Emmerich and Rawson Marshal Thurber mimicked Die Hard.",10.0,Anonymous,Action

Sergeant Powell begins to back away from the building quickly and you can see the flash from the gun that John McClane is shooting from the building in the background.

total kick-ass movie,"One of the original action flicks from the '80s, John McTiernan's ""Die Hard"" makes no pretense about being a kick-ass movie. Bruce Willis plays a New York cop John McClane, coming to LA to meet his estranged wife (Bonnie Bedelia). Sure enough, the building in which she works get hijacked by a group of German terrorists. Terrorist leader Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman in his debut), while totally evil, is also quite cultured. Even though the cards look stacked against John McClane, he's ready to take on every one of these terrorists.Twenty years after its release, this movie will probably only appeal to Willis's fans. While mostly a litany of machismo, there are some cringe-inducing scenes (namely when John has to walk across glass). But the movie's main focus is to show Bruce Willis being a tough guy. They do everything possible to make him a superhuman individual to whom we can still relate.All in all, this is a flick that you'll want to avoid if you're into intellectualism. But you'll love it if you're a testosterone-driven dude. I think that I'm content having seen it only once. Also starring Alexander Godunov (one of the Amish farmers in ""Witness""), Paul Gleason (the principal in ""The Breakfast Club"") and William Atherton (the EPA agent in ""Ghostbusters"").I wouldn't mind getting to ride off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.",5.0,Anonymous,Action

He can complete a hard action without using a stuntman and play a fine human touch well. In addition, it's funny that John doesn't die easily however he receives a serious wound.

Dignfied,"John McTiernan's dignified direction keeps this thriller from spinning out of control--not that the hysteria the cast brings to the proceedings doesn't try to subvert that intent. The cast includes Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman (in a performance that defines the film), Bonnie Bedelia, Reginald VelJohnson and the late Alexander Godunov and they're dead set on demonstrating their flashy talents. But McTiernan has always been a steady hand and has brought a necessary lighter touch to the genre than others in the field; it's easy to take the very underrated ""The Last Action Hero"" over anything Tony Scott might come up with (""True Romance"" being the exception). Here, the story of hostages held at the top of a high rise (with its echoes of ""The Towering Inferno"") is well-paced but muted; if he had wanted, McTiernan could have made a much louder epic. Fortunately, he didn't.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Best. Christmas. Movie. Ever,"Ah yes. The best Christmas movie to ever be released. Die Hard was released in 1988 and was based off of the novel titled ""Nothing Lasts Forever"" which is a sequel to a novel titled ""The Detective"" which in turn recieved a movie adaptation in 1968. But Die Hard is a standalone movie and not a sequel to the 1968 film The Detective. The film was released in July of 1988 and was that year's summer blockbuster but don't be fooled, this is still a Christmas movie. Much like how Halloween H20 is a Halloween movie but was released in August of 1998. The film stars Bruce Willis as New York cop John McClane and Alan Rickman as the villain Hans Gruber. The film was a huge success at the box office and with critics and audiences and has been labeled as one of the best action and Christmas films of all time. The film launched the carrers of both Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman. After the success of the first film, the film managed to spawn a series consisting of 5 films.The film follows New York cop John McClane traveling to Los Angeles to meet his wife whom are all going through a rough patch. His wife is working at the Nakatomi Corporation where a Christmas party is being held. With John at the party, Hans Gruber and his group of bad guys enter the building and lock it up making sure nobody enters and nobody leaves. But they did not know that John McClaine is in the building. What does Hans Gruber want? He wants $640 million from the safe in the Nakatomi building. And the rest of the film? Well, come on, it's one badass New York cop against an army of bad guys. It's pretty obvious.I am not gonna debate whether DIe Hard is a Christmas movie or not (because it is), but what can be said is that Die Hard is definitely the best action film to ever exist. What we have is not the macho man of a hero here. Had John McClane been one of those macho men, this film would have been seen as mediocre at best. With that being said, John McClane is bad ass. His dialogue is funny, he is the type of guy you want to hang out with (but not when he is blowing things up and getting shot at). Bruce Willis does a fantastic job as John McClane and has forever been cemented as a badass action hero. Alan Rickman does an extraordinary job as Hans Gruber and it manages to be his best role in my opinion. The other actors do a fine job as well. This film has the best action that I have ever seen. Sometimes, we don't know if McClane will make it out in one piece. There is a nice slow build up to the action and it does not dissappoint. The film is suspenseful which makes the action even more entertaining and worth watching. This is the film that started the birthed the modern action movie. Everything holds up in this film still to this day over 30 years after being released.Die Hard manages to be a film that is one of the best action films and best Christmas films of all time. It is a film that I can watch over and over again without being bored of the action or of the suspense. This is a film that is best watched with another person.",10.0,Anonymous,Action

"One Tower, One Terrorist Plot, One Man. The bar by which other action films are judged.","An outstanding action/thriller film from 1988, whose power still serves as a bench mark for which other action films are judged. John McClane (Bruce Willis) is New York cop who's visiting his estranged wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) for Christmas in Los Angeles. While working for the Nakatomi Corporation in one of the landmark skyscrapers, Holly, is going by her maiden name of Holly Gennaro - however, this is least of McClane's problems. A European terrorist cell, headed up by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) infiltrates the tower and puts it on lock down - nobody comes in, and nobody goes out. The intention of the well-orchestrated cell; is to rob them of millions of dollars' worth of bonds, but camouflage the theft by appearing to be an out and out terrorist threat. As John wasn't expected at the party and isn't on the staff list he's able to go missing, but with no help due and no way of gaining entry to the building he is alone to face off against Hans and his men.The film is tight, electrifying and tense at different times, while still having a heart and a sense of humour along the way. There isn't much wasted screen time at all and it's a testament to the director and writers that the pace and feel of the film is top notch. There may be plot holes and mistakes occasionally, but these can quite easily be ignored or forgotten due to the sheer magnitude of what is unfolding on screen, either on an epic scale, or in tight and claustrophobic situations. While other action films relying on action, strength or bullets to find a resolution, this film forces McClane to use his brains, cunning and guile to advance. To be completely honest, McClane isn't an archetypal action hero, he's an average Joe, and this makes his character more lovable. The use of brains and guile also same applies to Rickman's character; Gruber is cold and calculating - just when you think McClane has won a situation, it turns out the Gruber is one step ahead or has an ace in the hole. Delivered with sneering grit and hatred Gruber is a proper Machiavellian character, the kind is the perfect yang to McClane's Ying. Instead of just telling people he's smart, Gruber delivers on this and quite often out foxes McClane, forcing him to rethink and re-approach the situation. The casting of these two roles above everyone else in the film is fantastic.Spawning a series of sequels, the Die Hard movie isn't just the best of its follow up's, it's actually the bar by which films these days are judged. I read some film reviews and it's common to read something along the lines of: ""The is Die Hard, in a submarine"", or ""if Die Hard took place in a football stadium"". It's a testament to the quality of the film that 30 years later it stands tall as one of the absolute finest action films of modern cinema.It wouldn't be fair for me to award anything lower than an 8 out of 10 for this epic.",8.0,Anonymous,Action

"If you like Action-Adventure, It's worth seeing at least once.","To start with, I am a big fan of this genre and Die Hard is one of my all-time favorites. It starts out slow but quickly builds up to an exhilirating pace. This is probably Bruce Willis' best performance and film. This was my first experience with Alan Rickman and he plays the bad guy well! The one-liners and sarcasm are a little cheesy but most of the actors do a great job. In my opinion, John McTiernan does know how to make a movie you can enjoy. I must not be alone since over 190 of the 200 reviews so far, give this film high marks!

"This ""movie"" is regarded by several as one of the greatest action films in cinema. Is it worthy of that? Well.....","""Die Hard"" (1988), for a long time, I've wanted to see this ""movie"". Everyone is always talking about how great it is. People keep saying over and over again: ""this is the greatest action film of all-time!"" So, I finally gave in and bought the full ""Die Hard"" film collection on DVD. What a mistake I made! Such a complete waste of money it was. This ""movie"" has a very predictable and cliched story, standard to mediocre acting and a jumbled cliched soundtrack. As far as the storyline goes, it's just as basic as it sounds. A group of terrorists hold a group of people hostage in a 40 story hotel, and it's up to an underdog cop to save the day. Seen it! Being that this is one of the most popular action films of all-time, I thought: ""okay, they are on the right track. The plot is simple, and it'll be easier to get more invested in the action and any comedic elements. As long as they keep this recycled plot line fresh, this should be a great movie! Right?"" Wrong! Now, I'm being honest with you guys, this is one of the most boring action films I have ever seen. I actually kept falling asleep! During an action movie! How is that possible? Action films are supposed to be fun and exciting to watch, not dull and boring. Another really huge drawback, is that our hero, John McClane, played by Bruce Willis, gets hit more than the villains do. Now, I understand that fights between protagonists and antagonists in movies or TV shows have to be fair and incite challenge. The bad guys should get a few hits in, but ultimately lose at the end. The victory of the hero should be earned. At the end of the day, you want to see the villains get their brutal comeuppances. But, to tell you the truth, John McClane was nothing more than a bad guys' punching bag in this ""movie""! That was really frustrating, every fight scene was a huge disappointment. All of the other action scenes are just transplanted from better movies and poorly executed in this one. Be original, for crying out loud! As far as the acting goes, it's just mediocre for the most part. The only ones who actually gave somewhat passable performances in this ""movie"" were Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman and Reginald VelJohnson. Those three made the ""film"" worth watching, because they are all good in other movies or shows they're in. They had potential, but sadly, the poorly written script marred them from giving it their all. Such a crying shame! The soundtrack is okay in some places, but it's just a jumbled mess. It doesn't stay on a consistent tone and once again sounds like a last minute addition. Why rush something like the film score? That's one of the most crucial elements of a movie or TV show. Seriously, that's really starting to infuriate me! Now for the positives, yes, there are indeed a couple of positive elements in this trash heap. The sets/locations and the special effects are perfect. All of the sets/locations are great and help give the ""movie"" a nice atmosphere. You can't go wrong with Los Angeles! Finally, the special effects are well-done and still hold up to this day. ""Die Hard"" is, without a doubt, one of the biggest letdowns out of any movie I've seen during the first viewing. Now, it's not the worst letdown, but it's definitely up there! I'm struggling to rate this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. A word of advice, don't listen to what other people say, especially ""professional"" critics. The only opinion that matters is yours. If you're looking to watch a great action film, just avoid ""Die Hard"". Otherwise, you could ""Die Bored""!",4.0,Anonymous,Action

Must-see film for future directors and screenwriters.,"There are often playful arguments about whether Die Hard is a Christmas movie or not.

The Reason Die Hard Is The Best Film In The Series...,"I guess we could go down the 'Bruce Willis is in his prime here' path or even Alan Rickman is the perfect bad guy. But really this film excels beyond the average action film and it's sequels due to the fact it's in a contained, restricted environment where only stealth and quick thinking can secure the advantage against the odds. This scenario ramps up tension when there's little chance of escape. Unlike the following films which diluted the tension somewhat by allowing John McClane to run around freely or going on chaotic vehicle chases.
 Bruce Willis wisecracks become the light in the darkness in Die Hard. Including his lighter that leads him down ventilation shafts. The action is purposeful and tense. Each fight there's a reward to be had for success which helps to heighten the action suspense. Ammo is limited and our hero really doesn't want to be where he is.
 All in all Die Hard becomes an action, suspense, thriller where the outcome isn't looking positive and the underdog faces some strict odds in a claustrophobic scenario. A tension filled, thinking man's action film is what results here. And something which is rarely achieved to this day.",8.0,Anonymous,Action

First and still the best,"What can you say about Die Hard that hasn't been said a million times before? How about 'its crap'? Well, the reason why that hasn't been repeated ad nauseum is because it blatantly isn't true.Die Hard is one of those rare genre defining films. The first time I saw it I was 9 and was totally blown away. I have probably watched it once a year since then and I don't think its lost any impact.You know the drill by now. John McLane is out numbered (but never outgunned) by a group of terrorists in a high tech building. Cue much death and destruction before happy ending. It sounds so simple. Well, actually, it is. Die Hard perfected the formula of the action film, attempted by so many 80's films. Its actually a testament to Die Hard that they 'don't make em like they used to'.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
The 2nd best action film of all time,"Yes, I'm afraid it's the 2nd best action film of all time, in my opinion.The best is ""WHERE EAGLES DARE"". but ""DIE HARD"" is not too far behind.I agree with ever review that I have read on this site.  It is a different kind of Action Thriller that other Directors can learn from. The original idea of John McClane being trapped in a huge building miles away from his hometown of New York, without his socks and shoes is a great idea and making him absolutely scared out of his wits is even better. A hero who is scared, doesn't think that he is hard but is, much the opposite of many a boring Hollywood Pic. Die Hard is one of the most original, entertaining, SUBTLE(something Hollywood can't seem to do, but excel here) and tense films ever.",,Anonymous,Action
That was fun,"I know, I know, it's crazy, but I just saw Die Hard for the first time yesterday...in the year 2011. I heard how awesome and action-packed it was, so I came in expecting a two-hour thrill ride. And that's exactly what I got. John McClane was a combination of McGyver and Rambo wrapped up in a muscular chain-smoking package. As for the plot, it was pretty good. It wasn't anything too heavy, or too simplistic. A group of bad guys infiltrate a high rise building where an exclusive party is being held, take hostage those inside, blow the brains out of the company's leader, make threats and basically buy time as the group's tech wizard breaks into the highly-secured and technologically advanced giant safe containing millions of dollars in bonds. Meanwhile, McLane -- a New York cop in LA visiting his wife -- sneaks around the building picking off one bad guy after another, eventually gaining communication with an unwitting cop on patrol named Al Powell. This connection to the outside world brings in the LAPD and eventually the FBI.The only thing that annoyed me about this film was how the cops were portrayed. They were either too hard-headed (Chief Johnson played by Paul Gleason), too smart for patrol (Powell), or just plain old dumb (the dispatchers).",7.0,Anonymous,Action
No resemblance to reality,"This is a fun movie to watch, but don't expect any resemblance to reality. The hero has so many close calls and is saved at the last second, it really gets humorous.

Rarely do we see anyone having to change magazines and yet the guns just seem to keep shooting and shooting and shooting.

Generational Franchise starter,"Die Hard has become a cultural phenomenon of the action genre since its release, and with the releases of its four and counting sequels. Having finally watched the film for the first time, one can see as to why the film is as praised and beloved as it is.Bruce Willis brings the charisma, and overall do-whatever in his character of John McClane that his overall presence is what carries the film, which turned him into the action star we saw in his career.As for the film, since it is quite lengthy in running time, there are enough action scenes to entertain. Along with campy one liners from Bruce Willis, and other likable supporting characters including a limo driver, and officer helping McClane.Though the plot is quite standard, and somewhat stalls at points, the film does have enough punch to elevate. Although, Die Hard may feel somewhat over hyped, it is fun none the less. Overall good film.

Classic action that made Bruce Willis an A list star,"Coming off of Predator, director John McTiernan was on a roll making a very different, but also an instant action classic with Die Hard. This movie also turned relatively unknown actor Bruce Willis into a big star instantly. Bruce was a different kind of action hero than Stallone or Schwarzenegger, being much more of an everyman than a jacked up killing machine. He plays a heavy duty cop caught in a building that is being taken over by terrorists that his wife is also held hostage by. This is really well done, nicely shot and put together. The story flows well with tons of great looking action scenes and explosions. The acting is also very solid with Bruce Willis truly rising to the occasion as leading man. Also, Alan Rickman gives a super strong cinematic debut as terrorist leader Hans Gruber, who is easily one of the best screen villains of all time. Hollywood tried copying this formula for years to come. I personally, don't like any of the sequels and the ripoffs like Speed, Cliffhanger and Con Air are pure crap in my opinion. But, Die Hard is really solid and really holds up. Essential action, an absolute classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Excellent action thriller! Yipee-ki-yay!,"Okay cowboy, here are the odds: The forty-story Nakatomi Building has been seized by twelve German terrorists armed with automatic weapons. Thirty people have been taken hostage. You? You're just a cop, in the wrong place at the wrong time. Sound hard? Let's make it harder. You're not wearing any shoes!Prepare to DIE HARD!DIE HARD is the story of a New York cop, John McClane (Bruce Willis), who is in Los Angeles, visiting his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia). While he is sitting in a room making ""fists with his toes,"" a team of terrorists led by the brilliant, cold-blooded, and yet charming Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) seizes the building and takes everybody hostage. That is, everybody except McClane!And so begins one of the best action thrillers made. DIE HARD grabs the audience and does not let go! The American Film Institute just released its choices for the top 100 most heartpounding movies ever made. DIE HARD sits at #35, defeating other edge-of-your-seat movies like CARRIE, TERMINATOR 2: JUDGEMENT DAY, and SPEED.Personally, DIE HARD was recommended to me when I was 14 years old by my 42-year-old British aunt. She felt it was ""wonderful.""Now, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) did give DIE HARD an R rating and it is well-deserved. DIE HARD has pervasive profanity (and let's just say that four-letter words play an active role in McClane's vocabulary), lots of bloody action violence, and some extremely brief nudity.But before that turns you off, let me say a few things. First, the nudity in the film is, like I said, extremely brief. The first time I saw the film, I did not notice it (and I'm the kind of ""goody-goody"" who is very offended by nudity and would notice it right away). Second, the violence, though plentiful, is also almost justifiable. DIE HARD does not have any TERMINATOR-style senseless violence nor does it have any RAMBO-style ""shoot anything that moves"" violence. One can relate to McClane and understand why he kills. Chances are, one would do what McClane does if caught in a similar situation. Furthermore, even though DIE HARD has abundant shooting and explosions, the final body count is 16.""[McClane] is not here to be a hero,"" says action star Jean-Claude Van Damme, ""He is simply a man who is in the wrong place at the wrong time.""Parents, if you like the plot of DIE HARD but do not want your children watching all the violence and profanity, I understand, and I'd recommend showing them MASTERMINDS.Otherwise, get ready for ""40 stories of sheer adventure!""Yipee-ki-yay!Grade: 94/100 A",9.0,Anonymous,Action
A true action classic!----9/10,"Ah the late 80's. A time when action movies were made by stunt men and dynamite, instead of computers and green-screen. Also, a time where action movies were of much higher quality. You had your Lethal Weapon, your Terminator, and of course your Die Hard.Bruce Willis solidified his place in movie history by filming an entire action film barefoot. His performance as John McClane is hilarious and exciting. This man started the one-liners that became a cliché for action heroes later on. And he did all of his own stunts which includes the now classic jumping off an exploding skyscraper while tied to a firehose.Alan Rickman also stars as Hans Gruber, a diabolical thief disguised as a terrorist, creating one of the best villains of all time. He and Willis have a great chemistry on screen, another reason this movies is so damn good. The action is also more realistic then other movies. McClane sneaks around and ambushes the baddies, (sort of like Rambo in a building) instead of running with guns blazing, in which case he would have been blown away in the first reel.Die Hard is one of th best action movies of all time due to it's explosive action, great acting, cool location, and exciting story.

Influential but flawed,"Some people talk about this film as if it's one of the all time best. It's certainly been very influential, but let's not overlook some of the flaws. Too much time is spent on stupid supporting characters who don't believe what's going on. It detracts from what should be a breathless pace. Keeping all the action in one locale is kind of boring. I liked the sequel better because the action shifted around a lot. Hans is a villain in the Bond tradition, but the fact that he goes through this much trouble just for some money wasn't very convincing to me, nor did it make him despisable enough.

Top Tier Action Film,"John McClane, an NYC cop, makes a visit to California to see his ex-wife, Holly, and family in time for the holidays. Taking place at the Nakatomi building, little do John and others know that a group of terrorists, led by Hans Gruber, plan on holding the place hostage long enough for the group to break into a vault concealing over six-hundred million dollars. What hasn't already been said about this movie? It has been the staple and influence for many others in its genre and is quite possibly the greatest action film of all time. From the stunts to the sound design, choreography, tension, quips, shootouts, and so on and so forth. The two main players in the story, that being John and Hans, play off of each other well, as one tries to figure out the other in a game of cat and mouse. Alan Rickman proves to be cold and calculating as Hans and also on the same level as Bruce's character in different ways. Meanwhile, you have many supporting players and pieces that contribute to the escalation of the situation, like the hot headed LA police chief, the news reporter, the FBI, an overconfident associate of Holly's, Karl (right hand man of Hans), etc. Then you have Sargent Al Powell, who John makes a beautiful comradery with by the end of the film. As great as this movie is, there is just one little thing that holds me back from a ten. With so much going on, there are a couple of scenes we jump to that I believe bring the movie to a halt. Perhaps the editing department could've found a way to improve the pacing of those scenes to fit the overall flow of the film, but other than that, Die Hard deserves all of the praise it can get.

The best claustrophobic action movie ever made,"""Die Hard"" started an entire genre of movies.  The 'hostage in building who turns out to be a cop' genre.  All of the plane hostage movies, the building hostage movies, the boat hostage movies, they all evolved from ""Die Hard"", but not one of them matches its brilliance.Sure, the plot is on the thin side, but you cant have an incredibly complex plot if the movie story only spans a few hours, takes place on one set, and is about a cop stopping hostage takers.  The plot is as thick as a movie like this needs to be, and the action is A+.  From John McClane's (Bruce Willis) first fight with a nerdy German terrorist to the ending shootout, Die Hard delivers one of the greatest action movies of all time.Willis' McClane is clever, hot-tempered and funny.  He is the perfect action hero, and even beats the likes of Stallone and Schwarzenneger.  Alan Rickman steals the show as the lead villain, Hans Gruber.

At least Willi's character can back his actions, which is better than alot of 30 an 40 year olds who run around living in denial.  I guess this over macho 80's bi-product is the shame of my generation.  It has a lot of sappy Hollywood cliches.  The over syrupie cop who can not fire his gun, and why did they have the Run DMC limo driver in this film, what did he add to this film. The boring over done gender conflict the action hero has with his wife.  I do not know if this is because of Raider of the lost Ark, but the late 80's early  90's where full of blond bad guys, how over done.  Every late 80's action film has to copy 48 hours swearing to prove how macho one is. Despite this baggage the action saves this film.

Die Hard explodes its way in becoming the pinnacle of action films.,"It isn't Christmas if you don't watch Die Hard. Yippee-kiyay motherfu...well, you know the rest. John McClane. Nakatomi Plaza. Hans Gruber. Twinkies. ""Let it snow, let it snow, let it snoooow"". McTiernan's near-masterpiece is the epitome of 80s action and truly sets the bar high for future action films. It evolves the genre to new levels by balancing drama and character development with memorable explosions and a slew of gunfire. McClane visits his wife on her Christmas work party, when a group of terrorists hold them hostage for a large sum of money. But McClane doesn't sit down and roll over. Oh no, in typical cowboy fashion he targets the enemy. Luring them to their demise. Bang. You just got ""McClaned"". ""Thanks for the advice"". This isn't just an action film, don't be fooled by its overwhelming praise. Although justified, this is also actually a well balanced crime thriller. Gripping dialogue between McClane and Gruber allows both characters to have infectious personalities. The former being this New York loud mouth with a ludicrous amount of quippy lines and the latter being the commanding antagonist that withholds a sense of compromise. Their interactions, or lack of, was tangible. Then the police department and FBI get involved, but the development doesn't stop there. In fact, it just ramps up with the action. Aside from Argyle, who is just an obvious plot convenience, all the characters have natural inclusion to the story. The action was explosive and surprisingly bloody, particularly the rooftop C4 explosion. McTiernan's direction was perfect, crafting a perfectly paced narrative. Packed to the brim with memorability, from its antagonist and his slow-motion demise (Rickman was an absolute legend) to the various quotable lines of dialogue. This is a near-perfect film, and one that deserves the acclaim it has garnered.

Lots of explosions and gunfire - fab!,"The problem with starring in a film with Alan Rickman is to stop him stealing the show. Rickman is great in this film too. He is such a good bad guy...But, unlike the Costner Robin Hood film, he does not steal the show - not quite...This is partly because Bruce Willis's part is bigger (or so he tells us), but also because he is excellent. As always, Willis carries off his role with aplomb and humour, and the action keeps coming, thick and fast. Very much plot-driven, rather than character-driven, but this is what one has signed up for of course.the stunts are convincing, and the plot is tightly woven.Of its kind, this is as good as it gets.My only small objection is that Willis's sidekick is a gentleman of colour, and this smacks to me a little bit of Seagal movies where there is always a black guy or a native American worshipping the ground our hero walks on.

Good on a rainy and boring sunday,"This is a famous piece which i heard its really good. Ive read that this is one of those classic film you have to watch atleast once in you life. So i decided to finally give it a watch for myself.A thrilling plot that really fits the genre.Soundtrack isn't really the best, i feel like it doesent fit that good at some moments.I feel the manuscript feels pretty authentic and relaxed.The filming is also very good and very well made.The first 30 minutes feels pretty realistic and is pretty well made. But then it gets worse. It gets abit lame. The manuscript and editing gets pretty bad, abit silly, bad scripting, abit exaggerated and low quality.Both Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman does very great performances!!I think definitely this is a watchable film. But it doesn not deserve the high rating as it has on imdb. And i wouldn't really consider it a classic. Its a film thats very easy to watch, that you could watch on a rainy sunday. But not that good. Dont except too much from it.",5.0,Anonymous,Action

Does it sound like I'm ordering a pizza?,"There's a reason why Bruce Willis is paid millions to make action films long after he should have retired from that sort of thing. This film is that reason.The 1980s brought us some great action heroes. Arnie, Stallone and van Damme all churned out action films like there was no tomorrow and gave us some great entertainment. None of those actors were able to give us the charisma and everyman likeability that WIllis brought when playing McClane though. That is the reason why the Die Hard franchise is still loved today.To think that Bruce Willis was only really known as a PI on a TV show (Moonlighting) and the fact that various actors were offered the role of McClane before him only makes his sky rocket to stardom all the more impressive.As for the film itself, there is a certain raw simplicity in a cop stuck in a skyscraper with nothing but his wits and any guns he can steal from the bad guys that still resonates with audiences today. I defy anyone who says they are a fan of action films to not love Die Hard.",9.0,Anonymous,Action

The definitive 80's action film,"This is one of the very best films I've ever seen at the cinema and its greatness shines through on (a decent) TV. The plot is fabulously layered yet crisp, the characters are very strong (Rickman's Hans sets the standard), the story has many wonderful character moments yet gets on with it when it needs to...wonderful stuff.In particular, Bruce's hero is brilliantly reluctant, always trying to sit out the storm rather than lead it along. This was so refreshing after years of the cheerfully bullet-spraying outings of Messrs Stallone and Schwarzenegger. There's plenty of military hardware and plenty of knuckle-biting moments. Really is one to savour as it sweeps you along.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Die Happy,"Despite its flaws, 'Die Hard' remains as one of the best action films of all time. I've seen this movie dozens of times, and really enjoyed its sequels (aside from part 2, a la 'Indiana Jones 2.') This absolute classic set all the standards, or in better terms, clichés. So, if you watch this today, you might recognize a lot of the scenes, dialogue, ""surprises,"" but real ""die hard"" fans will see this started it all. Much like 'Halloween' really was the birth of the slasher film (others will dispute, but it really was Michael Myers that started the trends.) Unfortunately for the copy-cats, 'Die Hard' had an excellent villain (Rickman) and supporting cast. In addition, and most importantly, it had Bruce Willis who was, I've read, the bottom of the barrel choice of the producers and yet, contributed the most depth of ANY HERO of these 'Die Hard' rip offs. He had great lines, depth, realistic approach, was vulnerable, and simply human. As stated, despite its flaws (the white-to-green wife beater was solely a distraction and the fact two main characters seemed to just ride off in the sunset – yes, it was part of the storyline, but surely unrealistic to the rest of the ""it could really happen"" plot) 'Die Hard' was nearly perfect, and this was thanks to nearly perfect performances from Rickman and Willis. Not to mention the continuous and great action sequences. Basically, on Christmas Eve, Willis flies into LA from NYC to make good with wife only to help hostages during a heist. Only thing I would've done differently in Willis' role was, when he had the police on the secret radio, was to threatened the President. I'm sure that would've brought more than just the police. And $.74 gas? Wow, I love the 80s!",9.0,Anonymous,Action
The Bad Guy Stupid Syndrome,"Die Hard was of course back in 1988 a great triumph for Bruce Willis. Today it looks sometimes a little outdated but still the action is fine. The one thing that drags Die Hard for me down (even back in 1988) is the stupid behavior of the bad guys (but Alan Rickman of course is just delicious to watch). They got all the hostages, there is simply no reason to hunt McClane in the skyscraper (!). Think about it and you know the solution how to get him fast and without loss of men.

It just needs to be an office party in this case.Compare that to movies like Elf, Scrooged, Hudsucker Proxy, or Sleepless in Seattle where the holiday plays a key role, and try to change the holiday.

The Ultimate Christmas Movie,"Is it a Christmas movie? Is it an action movie? Whatever it is, it's an amazing and enjoyable movie. New York City policeman John McClane (Bruce Willis) is visiting his estranged wife (Bonnie Bedelia) and two daughters on Christmas Eve. He joins her at a holiday party in the headquarters of the Japanese-owned business she works for. But the festivities are interrupted by a group of terrorists who take over the exclusive high-rise, and everyone in it. Very soon McClane realizes that there's no one to save the hostages -- but him.The movie concept is just amazing. The whole movie is set in that building and all the events occur during a short period of time. With a 2 hours and 15 minutes runtime, you would think it would get really boring and repetitive. However its the complete opposite as it is made in a way where it's always exciting and fun. Additionally, the action scenes and effects are super entertaining and engaging.Bruce Willis was juts dazzling with his role. He was just perfect from every aspect. Additionally, Alan Rickman is just amazing at this role because of his great charisma and the intimidation his character presents. Although Argyle's character might seem annoying to some, he really adds a much needed comedic sense to the movie.Die Hard is one of best action movies that anyone could watch at any time of the year.

"Alan Rickman was born on February 21st, 1946","Die Hard (1988), is one of those action films, that has stood the test of time. It has ingrained itself into the public's memories. It has many memorable moments, that people reference all the time. These components include such great moments like, Nakatomi Tower, ""shoot the glass"", the Christmas movie debate and Twinkies, which are just a few of the great moments taken from this film. It is a fun thrill-ride of comic book style action, with a plot juicy enough for a film like this. It is one of the great contributors to the action, crime, drama boom of the 1980s. It cemented this genre/sub-genre, into the popular one it continues to be today.NYPD detective, John McClane (Bruce Willis), is just trying to make up with his wife and go to a work/Christmas party, but then terrorists take over Nakatomi Tower in Los Angeles, where the party is happening. In order to break into a vault inside the building, the bad guys, led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), need a code from the building owner. The owner does not give up the codes and things go worse from here. McClane gets pulled into all of it. While he deals with all of this, his wife is still up at the party as a hostage. Alan Rickman's performance of bad-guy, Hans Gruber, created a character, made for the ages. Rickman was always good at portraying his characters, with a weaselly lilt added to it. This character was perfect for him.Die Hard (1988), is a gritty action film, with a police crime setting. It comes with plenty of thrills, moments of nicely-placed comedy and it's something, that doesn't need to be taken seriously. All it wants to do is entertain you. It lets you relax, with a moving comic-book on the screen. It is a spectacle, that you can just ride along with. It was so popular, it became a franchise. Die Hard (1988), has achieved the classification of being a modern classic.

About as good as action movies get outside James Cameron,"The movie which truly launched Bruce Willis' movie career and made him serious, Die Hard is quite simply a perfect slice of 80s Hollywood action, cheese, humour and bang for the buck.Willis, as if you didn't know, is John McClane, arguably the most famous fictional cop of all time, up against maybe the most defining villain in Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber we've ever seen.McClane is quite simply wrong man wrong place wrong time and yet right man right place right time and right result - a truly epic David v Goliath face-off where McClane, with his walkie talkie and Al at the other side, sees the viewer rooting for the little guys while the big bad guys appear untouchable.Terrorists have taken over the Nakatomi Plaza in California, see, where McClane has gone to be with his wife following her move there from New York - and it doesn't take long before John is outwitting them wherever he can, aided by one of the most underrated performances in Hollywood history.Willis manages to portray a good honest flawed man in a fine display of actual acting, while keeping himself going by sheer will and a touch of help from Al - and just keeps staying one step ahead of the terrorists.But if we're praising Willis, Rickman's Gruber is just sensational - pure villainy, with great humour, incredible charisma and this movie launched Rickman as much as it did Willis. All the supports are great too, and the cheesy fun never outstays its welcome - the movie teases us a little with its intro, but the body out of the window onto Al's car might be one of the best ignition sequences in the history of movies. It's dynamite.As is the rest of the movie.A few tiny plot holes, sure, but who cares. It's as good as action gets without Cameron being involved - you will have an amazing blast with this superb yarn.",10.0,Anonymous,Action

I liked it when the guy was on the roof.,"While ostensibly an action movie, I won't say this movie has aged badly but time has matured this from an action movie to simply a taut comedic thriller.It's not as dynamic or as explosive as movies would become but it still makes an agreeable exercise in badassdom as a lone individual struggles against a team of bad guys within a finite space.Bruce Willis carries a lot of this with his getting-pretty-sick-of-everything persona, you don't even mind it's a cop.A little slow in the first act and it does seem to rely too much on profanity to sound touch (nothing wrong with profanity though).

An unlucky day,"In 1988, a little film with a little known actor burst onto the screens of America. Its high powered action and wise cracking unsuspecting hero found their way into the hearts of action movie fans and, to this day, it remains a testament to the great and glorious eighties. The decade of great action, unforgettable comedy, and undying horror.Following a short stint on TV's Moonlighting, Bruce Willis teamed up with director John McTiernan to bring to life the character of Detective John McClaine. A New York City police officer who flies out to Los Angeles to see his estranged wife and kids. What follows is the most unlucky day a man can have.People do not remember that before this film came out nobody knew who Bruce Willis was, but after, you could not find someone who did not know his name or his face. His popularity is still high to this day, and it is all owed to one man. Detective John McClaine. Bruce Willis' portrayal of the character is one of the main reasons this movie is considered a modern classic. His quick wit and gun-tastic prescene make him the ultimate action hero. He is not the indestructible terminator or the special forces trained Rambo. He is just a regular guy who has been unwittingly sucked into the most unfortunate of circumstances and Bruce Willis plays the character like no one else could, with great humor and a sense of foolhardy abandon.Bruce Willis is not the only great performance in this one. Alan Rickman as the German terrorist, Hans Gruber is amazing. He always seems to impress and that is no different in this classic. Hans Gruber is backed up by two great performances by his second in command Karl, played by Alexander Godonov, and Clarence Gilyard Jr who plays Hans' tech guy, Theo. Sgt. Al Powell, played by Reginald VelJohnson, lends a simpathetic ear to our hero and he performs amazingly. A semi-static performance by Bonnie Bedelia as John's wife does little to bring the overall performances in this one down one bit.Die Hard accomplished many things in its theatrical run and subsequent release on video. It started the career of one of personal favorite actors, Bruce Willis. It gave us the unkillable and highly lovable character of John McClaine who still seems to impress after all these years, and it laid the groundwork for everything that came after it. Die Hard raised the bar for action movies, and to this day it remains one of the few high water marks for the action genre. This one is a great addition to any movie library and makes for an entertaining view every few months. While many movies seem to lose their luster after several viewings, this one seems to find its way onto my screen, thirty years after its release, more often than movies of only a couple of years old. Watch it now.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
A classic for some reason,"I can enjoy it enough to watch it every few years, but it's really not that good of a movie.From the idiotic dialog, to completely ridiculous actions of characters, to the complete over the top antics of others, it just isn't that well done.Let's start with the woman he first reaches wheen reporting the situation, to the stupidity of Ellis in every scene he was in. First doing lots of cocaine at the company Christmas party? To thinking he's the villains best friend just because he's offering them a little info.To the inconsistent use of C4, one small block blows out the entire floor when it fell down the shaft, yet up on the roof they had dozens of blocks of it for clearing off the helicopters and doing some damage.So much unnecessary stuff in the movie that just didn't make any logical sense. The first cop on site, his boss was overly dismissive and assumed a lot of wild stuff without any info. So much for dealing with facts I guess... ditto for the FBI agents, the icing on the cake was that they were willing to kill 20 to 25% of the hostages in their ""rescue"" attempt that had zero actual planning.On the plus side, at least Bruce Willis didn't like or act like he has in the last 20 or so movies he's been in.",5.0,Anonymous,Action

"Have a ""Blast"" Watching ""Die Hard""!","Die HardOne of the most full-out action movies of all time. It had the best formula, the best dialogue, the best stunts, the best characters, and the best explosions. ""Die Hard.""Bruce Willis plays John McClane, a recently divorced cop who travels to LA for the opening of his wife's new workplace, Nakatomi Plaza, owned by a rich Japanese man. His wife (Bonnie Bedalia) is happy to see McClane come, and we feel that they want to get back together. Perhaps this opening party will do it. But then it happens. As John takes a trip to the bathroom, a gang of terrorists (headed by Alan Rickman) take charge of the company building, demanding money. John hides out in the building and tries to think of a way to get the bad guys. They have no idea that John McClane is loose in the building, and only realize that someone is out there watching them when an elevator shaft is blown to pieces by Willis. Pretty soon, the LAPD, FBI, CIA, and just about anything with three or more letters is outside, and only one man has contact with John McClane from the outside - Reginald VelJohnson, a cop with a walkie-talkie.This is, without a doubt, Bruce Willis' best film. By far. His personality fits the persona of John McClane. It's fun watching him, for once.The formula for this movie is what makes it so great, however. Think about it. A man, trapped in a building with some bad guys; a one man army. The perfect action flick formula. But what makes it even better is the non-stop action and excellent, adrenaline-packed explosions and gunplay. People can criticize this movie for being unrealistic, but everyone needs an escape from reality once and a while. One of my favorite parts is where John grabs a fire hose from the top of the building, ties it around himself, and jumps off the edge of the building, smashing into the outside of the glass. Yes, it is very unrealistic, but I'll be darned if it isn't fun.Reginald VelJohnson, of TV's ""Family Matters,"" is perfect as The Cop on the Outside, having contact with The Man in the Inside. VelJohnson has mainly gotten supporting roles in films over the years. These credits include ""Turner and Hootch,"" ""Die Hard,"" and ""Die Hard 2: Die Harder,"" which was more of a cameo than anything else. Regardless, he is a good actor, and it's too bad his career has been so bad lately that he has had to resort to his old days by re-doing his character from ""Die Hard"" by voicing him in a PC game. It's sad enough when actors resort to videogames, but it's even sadder when video games only want you because of an old character you have played and not because of you, yourself.Of action is your specialty, see ""Die Hard"" as soon as you can.

Cemented the template for contemporary action films,"Lots of subtexts have been read into this film over the years--and anyone who has read a few of my reviews knows that I'm no enemy to reading subtexts into films, whether they were intended by the filmmakers or not. Die Hard has also sometimes been taken as one of the most infamous, token examples of ""what went wrong with Hollywood"". But when we get right down to it, Die Hard is so great simply because it's a tightly constructed, kick-ass action film that barely pauses a moment to let you breathe once it gets rolling. It may not have created the contemporary action template, but it certainly did a lot to cement it. Without Die Hard, we may well have not had films like Speed (1994), The Rock (1996), Air Force One (1997) or Panic Room (2002).In Die Hard, Bruce Willis is John McClane, a New York City cop who is heading out to Los Angeles to visit his estranged wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), and their two kids for Christmas. Holly's boss, Joseph Takagi (James Shigeta), has sent a limousine to pick John up at the airport. John stops by Holly's office in a large high-rise, partially to try to figure out where he's going to stay. Holly's coworkers are having a late Christmas Eve party--they're the last ones in the building, and they're 30-something stories up. Suddenly, ""terrorists"" take control of the building. It seems they have an issue with Holly's employer, the Nakatomi Corporation. John is able to hide and sneak away before they see him, but can one cop take control of 12 highly armed, highly trained ""terrorists""?Director John McTiernan, who was fresh off of his success from 1987's Predator, actually begins the film in a mode that is more akin to light comedy and deliberately paced drama. This helps intensify the contrast that shortly follows, although McTiernan periodically retains humor in the guise of sardonically hammy one-liners, mostly delivered by our hero. This was already becoming something of a cliché by the time Die Hard arrived, largely due to the influence of Arnold Schwarzenegger in the action genre (although many of his best one-liners were still ahead of him). Still, McTiernan's use of this sometimes-loathed device is incredibly effective as it is the only means of providing short respites from the nail-biting suspense and action. And besides, ""Yippee-ki-yay mf'er"" has to be one of the most memorable and funny--if silly--one-liners of all time.It's interesting that if you really analyze the plot, a large percentage of the suspense is created by merely maneuvering John and the terrorists around the building. The action scenes are not as frequent as they seem; McTiernan sustains a very high level of intensity through a surprisingly classical approach. The bulk of the film is an extended cat and mouse game, occasionally punctuated with gun violence and less occasionally physical combat. Of course, since the film is set in a skyscraper--the combination of Towering Inferno (1974) thrills and a very contemporary (both in 1988 and now) terrorist plot is a large part of what initially created a buzz--some of the more edge-of-your-seat moments are based on heights.In this type of action film, one of the most important traits for the lead actor to have is an impressive, plausible ""superhero"" physical presence. Willis, in his early 30s during filming, was perfect for the role. His slightly frumpy, balding look makes him believable as a New York City cop, but his physique is also in peak form here, while not being so over the top that you expect him to oil up and start flexing. The ""terrorists"" are appropriately different looking--more suave and sophisticated, as if they could be on the cover of a romance novel if they'd just beef up a bit and put down the machine guns. The other roles, insofar as they're significant (and a number are), are finely played if often campy, as they should be--it helps the audience adjust to the cartoonish fates of most of the support characters who are substantial enough to have an arc.As for those subtexts, there are a lot of interesting things you can read into the film's structure--foreigners are either bad guys or wildly successful capitalists who perhaps have a touch of ""bad guy"" in their threat to national sovereignty (this is especially true if we place the film in its historical-cultural context, as paranoia about ""Asians buying up America"", which has since subsided, was just beginning to loom large at the time). African Americans are limited to roles of moral support for the white male hero--entertainment historian Donald Bogle, who has made numerous studies of African Americans in film, amusingly interpreted the role of Sgt. Al Powell (Reginald VelJohson) as that of ""black-buddy-as-mammy nurturer"". And even though Holly has an ostensibly important position in the company, we see her as mostly subservient, manipulated or helpless. The other females in the film, to the extent that there are any, are primarily present as ""decorations"" at best.But the bigger question is whether any of those sociological issues of race, power, xenophobia and male domination are intended by the film. My guess is that they aren't, even if they're present due to other cultural factors. A big summer action movie in the U.S. needs a big action star, and for whatever reason, those had been primarily white males. The villains also needed to be almost cartoonish and mistakable for terrorists, and in the late 1980s, putting white male Americans as terrorists would have made the film implausible for much of the audience, and other kinds of Americans in the role (white females, blacks, etc.) would have been seen as equally political. McTiernan wasn't trying to make political or sociological statements so much as provide us with an exciting roller-coaster of a film, and that he did with flying colors.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
One Of Film's Greatest Action Movies,"Die Hard is one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen. It really is a perfect movie. The characters are incredible. Bruce Willis plays the greatest role he's ever been with the iconic John McClane. John McClane is likable, relatable, and is truly one the best protagonists ever. Alan Rickman has a phenomenal performance playing Hans Gruber. Hans Gruber is one of the best antagonist in any movie ever. He's well spoken, well dressed, calm in demeanor but still incredibly threatening throughout. Alan Rickman steals every scene he's in. Pretty much every character in this movie is extremely memorable from Reginald VelJohnson's Sgt. Al Powell to De'voreaux's Argyle to Bonnie Bedelia's Holly Gennaro/McClane to all the others. The movie is also extremely well written. From the unforgettable dialogue to the clever plot set ups at the beginning of the movie, the script is really amazing. The action is of course incredible with every sequence being astonishing. Other than Raiders of the Lost, Die Hard is the greatest action movie ever to me.

Uneven in Pacing and Acting but Delivers great Dialogue,"Bruce Willis is an actor that I struggle to appreciate as much as I potentially should; therefore I struggle to enjoy his over the top egotistical style of characterisation for his role in Die Hard. Not helping this is a truly annoying and unrealistic badgering by the police force characters that are given ridiculously poor dialogue and story inclusion.However Alan Rickman is sensational as always, but he isn't given particularly memorable henchman and the scenes away from him or the action are quite boring.Overall, I see the hype and nostalgia, but that's pushing this film much higher than it really deserves to be considering that this style has been done better.",5.0,Anonymous,Action
The weather outside is frightful - but Bruce is stuck indoors,"Bruce Willis plays John McClane, a swaggering New York cop who arrives in LA to patch things up with his wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia, who would be sorely missed in the second sequel). Unfortunately, Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) has also come to town. He takes Holly and her work colleagues hostage on the 30th floor in a bid to bide time while his goons break into the vault to steal 600 million dollars in bearer bonds. McClane, meanwhile, is loose amongst the building's lift shafts and air vents, picking off Gruber's men with a pistol and a one-liner.Let's leave aside the Nakatomi Plaza's phallic presence (complete with climactic rooftop explosion) and concentrate on the people in it. John McClane: he's the sort of action hero who can chain smoke filterless European cigarettes before sprinting up four flights of stairs, having a fist fight and then leaping off a 40-storey building with a fire hose wrapped round his waist. Gruber, paradoxically, and yet strangely likewise, is precisely who we would want to be if we were a ruthless global criminal: suave, literate, deadly; an ""exceptional thief"".Events build up and up until we have a proper cat-and-mouse story. The odds are stacked against McClane: he's outnumbered, out-gunned, and out-shoed. But he's also a resilient fellow - a stubborn working man stuck in his ways - and he doesn't care much for foreign types trespassing on the ranch. For all the incredulity of many of our hero's actions, he is an everyman; forget juggernauts versus jet fighters - this incarnation of McClane huffs and puffs and bleeds. It HURTS jumping off a building, and he's modern enough to show it.Along the way we meet some neatly written side characters, most of whom belong to the bumbling good guys. Deputy Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson (Paul Gleason) is scoping for promotion; journalist Richard Thornburg (the hilarious William Atherton, effectively reprising his role from Ghost Busters) sniffs a Pulitzer; and FBI agents Johnson and Johnson (Robert Davi and Grand L. Bush) just want to chew gum and get the job done with acceptable hostage losses.McTiernan is a peerless action director when he's on form (see also Predator and Die Hard With a Vengeance), and this is his pinnacle, harking from the days when stunts meant stunts, not green-screen. Thumbs-up to cinematographer Jan de Bont, too, for proving that his best work is done on another director's leash. And Michael Kamen's score - foreboding and triumphant in equal measures - is so good it barely changed a note for three movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
The way an action movie should be done.,"Loosely based on the novel ""Nothing Lasts Forever"" by Roderick Thorp, and scripted by Jeb Stuart and Steven E. de Souza, ""Die Hard"" is very much one of THE quintessential action movies of the modern era, delivering many thrills and laughs for over two hours.It gave TV star Bruce Willis one of the defining film roles of his career, as a frustrated, foul mouthed, yet very human and talkative average Joe detective forced into becoming the hero, when a slick group of nasty terrorists infiltrate a high rise office building and cause havoc. John McClane (Willis) has to rely on his own wits and resilience to save the day when the odds seem to be outrageously stacked against him. To add to that, most of the authority figures on the outside turn out to be useless, to put it charitably.Willis is engaging in the lead, and convincing in action and fight sequences as well. One of the most appreciable and interesting facets to the movie is indeed the ""cat and mouse"" game he plays with the terrorist leader, a man named Hans Gruber. The always excellent Alan Rickman, at the time a very well respected Shakespearan actor, makes a hell of a film debut as Hans. Hans is an intriguing character because on one hand he's a well dressed, confident, intelligent, and cultured man, yet at the same time, he's a cold blooded creep. The other well developed relationship in the story is between John and L.A.P.D. sergeant Al Powell (future TV star Reginald VelJohnson, in his break through film role), the only person on the outside with more than half a brain in his head and who repeatedly offers John the words of encouragement that he needs.Lovely Bonnie Bedelia may play the only substantial female role in the movie, as Johns' estranged wife, Holly, but she's a tough cookie who does have the courage to stand up to Hans as he and his men throw their weight around. Alexander Godunov, who'd previously appeared in ""Witness"", is great fun as the thuggish, vengeance crazed goon Karl, who proves so indestructible near the end he comes off as a horror movie type of villain. Paul Gleason portrays inept, thoughtless deputy police chief Dwayne Robinson, a humourless jerk who served as a prototype for similar roles in future action movies. Other unlikable weasels are memorably portrayed by William Atherton (the stubborn, very self serving reporter) and Hart Bochner (the coke snorting corporate sleaze who foolishly thinks he can reason with Hans). Even the FBI agents on this case (Robert Davi, Grand L. Bush) come off as pretty dumb and don't express too much concern for the hostages. A number of other familiar faces in small roles, too: James Shigeta as corporation boss Takagi, De'voreaux White as the likable limo driver Argyle, Clarence Gilyard Jr. ('Walker: Texas Ranger') as the electronics expert Theo, Al Leong as candy bar thief / terrorist Uli, comedian Rick Ducommun as the city worker, and Mary Ellen Trainor (recognizable to action fans as the psychiatrist in the ""Lethal Weapon"" series) as the lady newscaster.""Die Hard"" is rough, tough, violent, hair-raising stuff. Although somewhat overextended at two hours and 13 minutes, it never gets dull. Director John McTiernan, who'd already proved his abilities on *his* breakthrough movie, ""Predator"", guides it all in style, and he and his crew are up to the challenge of shooting sequences in some tight spots. Michael Kamens' music is thrilling, and the special effects by Richard Edlunds' Boss Corporation are most impressive. Often very funny (with a generous dose of quotable dialogue), the story has genuinely touching moments as well. The big finish is especially riveting.True filmmaking craftsmanship results in superior visceral entertainment the entire time. Four sequels have followed it so far.In closing, it would be impossible to imagine a fan of this genre not having a copy of this movie in his or her movie collection.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
The ultimate action classic,"Ah yes, the original Die Hard. So much has been said about this movie, and almost everyone acknowledges its importance for the action genre, myself included. This isn't just a fun action movie that you can watch and enjoy, even though it is that as well. This movie surpasses almost all other action movies from the 80's in terms of writing and structure. The plot is simple and easy to follow, and nothing is being kept secret from us, which means it's easier to get a grasp of the situation. It's also very well paced, with just the right balance between action and dialogue. The movie is also very well directed and edited. However, the biggest strength of the movie are the characters. John McClane is practically the perfect protagonist. He's well fleshed out, he's sympathetic, he's funny , while also being both a complete badass AND vulnrable at the same time. Bruce Willis obviously contributed a lot to this character, it's wouldn't have worked nearly as well with someone else. The villain, played excellently by the late Alan Rickman, is almost equally great. He's a cold-blooded murderer and very menacing while also being very sophisticated and super enjoyable to watch and listen to. The movie's best scenes are arguably the ones where The hero, the villain and the concerned cop outside of the building talkto each other over the radio, it is an excellent way of letting them interact without actually meeting in person, as having them meet would cause the movie to lose a sense of realism. The rest of the cast also does an incredible job, there is no weak link in it. The movie also feels like a mature and very violent action movie, which is something I miss in today's film industry. There is a lot of gore and swearing, and this just adds to the gritty sense of realism the movie presents so brilliantly. I cannot think of a single thing this movie does completely wrong, it's probably my favorite action movie and will remain so for a long, long time.",10.0,Anonymous,Action

Welcome to the comment pal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"When Die Hard came out Bruce willis was not an action star. That is what made this movie so good. If it were Arnold Shwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone as the star this would have been just another standard bullet festival. Instead we got Bruce Willis and he rules in this movie. Plus Alan Rickman at his sleaziest best. Some people complain that the plot is impossible but who cares. There's good dialogue, great stunts, great special effects, and in my opinion the plot ain't half bad. How can you not love Bruce Willis's wise cracking cop under pressure.

A Christmas Movie,"Most 80s action films set the standard for how all action movies should be, and Die Hard is one of those films that made it so. It had action, violence, comedy, explosions, great fights, and an intriguing villain. Die Hard is the definition of a perfect action blockbuster. With a fun story, fun adventure, and a great cast, this would be my top recommendation for anyone in for a thrill and a good time.In my experience with iconic movies, The more quotable a movie is, the better. This movie runs on iconic quotes and one liners. Just scroll through the Quotes section for this movie.The reason Bruce Willis has a list of of great action films on his filmography is because he is a great action movie star. He is so charismatic and is hard core in all the fight scenes. He has his emotional moments, but is always there to give us a laugh. He's just fun to watch and that's why his role just works. And John McClain is a hero.Then there's Alan Rickman. I believe this is his film debut. As a villain, he was very charming, calm, cool, cynical - the perfect villain. His iconic voice was made for a role like this, and this was honestly one of his greatest movies. I believe this movie helped him get roles in films like Robin Hood and Harry Potter, both which were also iconic roles of his.Speaking of Alan Rickman, it is not Christmas until Hans Gruber falls off Nakatomi Plaza. Yes, this is a Christmas movie. There isn't even an argument to why it wouldn't be. It happens on Christmas at a Christmas party, it got it's own Christmas rap, other Christmas songs play throughout the movie and during the credits, and good defeats evil in a Christmas miracle sort of way.

Hits so Hard,"John McTiernan and John McClain, it is like a match made in heaven. McTiernan, the director of action movie hits like ""Predator"" and ""Hunt for Red October"" knocks it out of the park with this staple in the action movie genre. It is hard to quantify the impact this film had on action movies going forward. In 1988, ""Rambo III"" was the more typical formula for an action movie. Bigger explosions, more bullets and invincible heroes. After the more grounded and isolated approach of ""Die Hard"" suddenly the focus of action movies changes. Our heroes are less like Schwarzenegger and more like Nic Cage. We trade out a John Rambo, for a John McClain.What makes this movie work is how vulnerable and human our protagonist is. He is a great example of the reluctant hero, just in the wrong place at the wrong time. By the end of the movie, you feel like he has gone through the ringer. When 12 ""terrorists"" take control of a plaza, any other action hero of the time would have run out gun's blazing. But here we have a hero who is smart enough, and human enough to run.We also have a great back and forth between the hero and villain. Part of what makes Bond Villains as memorable as they are, is the fact that they are given the opportunity to face off with our hero various times through the picture. And in this case, thanks to the radio, Gruber and McClain get a lot of time to work off each other. Likewise, all the henchmen of Gruber are memorable characters in their own right.I have watched this movie enough times, and I have enough films that try to be like Die Hard, that I pick up the little details that make this one work, and others fail. First off, thanks to Mctiernan's excellent camera work and directing, the audience is given a good sense of location and distance throughout the film. Second would be the characters. The news reporter and police subplots could easily have just felt like homework to sit through. But thanks to terrific acting and writing, they are just entertaining set up, to a great pay off.This film makes it on the list of Top 10 Action films of all time. Give it a watch any time of year and have yourself a merry little Christmas time.",10.0,Anonymous,Action

When it came to the end though, I just wasn't fully satisfied. I just felt that it didn't live up to expectations. Maybe it was because my expectations had been amplified by years of hearing such good things about it, maybe I just over-anticipated it. I still enjoyed it, even if it wasn't all I was hoping.

"""Only John can drive somebody that crazy!""","In what has to have been the highlight of Bruce Willis's hardcore action movie career, Die hard is a nonstop adrenaline packed thrill ride that even manages to avoid the Rambo effect, where the single hero takes down the whole world around him. John McClane is just a regular cop, he's just really good at what he does and he's thrust into a situation where he can either act or be killed, or let a lot of innocent people be killed.A group of terrorists, led by Hans Gruber (a delightfully sinister Alan Rickman) has taken a building-full of hostages in Los Angeles and are demanding the release of prisoners in Northern Ireland, Canada, and Sri Lanka. Clearly this is a pretty lofty goal, but it's only a cover to buy time while the terrorists go after their real goal, which is to steal the$ 640,000,000 in bearer bonds in the building's safe.What makes John so convincing and so human is that he has not come here to save the world, he came because he's a New York police officer but his wife got a job in Los Angeles that he didn't think she would keep. She has become more and more comfortable, so he came all the way to LA to try to convince her to come back to New York to be with him.What follows is one of the most skillfully crafted action movies in the genre. Director JohnMcTiernan made his name with this movie, even after the similarly impressive Predator the year before. Robert Davi turns in an outstanding performance as the FBI agent assigned to take over control of the situation from the incompetent LAPD, and the movie even takes time to take a jab at the press, which nearly blows everything near the end of the movie.Note: There is a point in the movie where we see a gas station which is selling unleaded for $0.75 a gallon!

The best,"Quite possibly the best action film you will ever see. There's a reason that a frame from this film is there in the action section because this is action film making at its best. It starts right away into the plot after a brief introduction of the characters and after that you will be on the edge of your seats till the end. The biggest strength of this film is that every character is written perfectly and have their intentions or roles defined. You don't normally expect great acting in an action flick but Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman knock it out of the park with their performances. Even the smaller characters like the cop and the cabbie contribute to the story. In short, if you haven't yet seen this film, do yourself a favour and go watch it right away.

The True Definition of an Action Movie,"No action movie has ever given the kind of thrill that Die Hard did when I watched on one Christmas Eve when I was 12 years old.As the years have past, my opinions on the movie have escalated to gigantic proportions and I think that not only is it the most entertaining action movie of all time, but one of the most entertaining movies of any genre ever made!! Part of the reason has to do with the hero: Bruce Willis' John McClain is my favorite movie cop ever and, IMO, he probably will never be topped. He is very believable in the part and you root for him every second.Another thing is Alan Rickman, who not only created one of the most vile and chilling villains in movie history, but gave a performance that should have won him the Oscar....but sadly, he was snubbed the entire award season.The movie's script isn't perfect but it gets the job done and very well I might add....and John McTiernan does one heck of a job with the direction....possibly the best (or in the top 3 for me) when it comes to action movie directions.I don't think you can really go wrong with Die Hard....it is a classic in every sense of the word and I love the film passionately!!",10.0,Anonymous,Action
The best action movie ever made,"""I now have a machine gun. Ho ho ho"". The iconic taunt by hotshot NYC cop John Mcclane to the terrorists he's evading in a gigantic LA high rise that's under siege. This is the prototype, patient x, the catalyst for an army of homages, imitations, sequels and an entire subculture of action movie mania. It's got few bells or whistles, nothing too extravagant like a lot of the CGI laden PG-13 crap that masquerades as action these days (I'm looking at you Expendables 3), just a good old fashioned, down n' dirty piece of bloody holiday fun with one of the most exciting set ups in any flick of the genre. Bruce Willis has probably never been better as the wise cracking, amusingly self deprecating tough guy who wants nothing to do with the situation, just wants to reconnect with his estranged wife (Bonnie Bedelia) on Christmas Eve and take it easy. The extremists have other ideas, though, ruthlessly taking the skyscraper she works in hostage and locking it down like Fort Knox. Mcclane cunningly infiltrates it, and the bone crunching, bullet spraying Yuletide joy takes off, hardly letting up for a minute. Mcclane is both helped and hindered by law enforcement outside the building, including sympathetic beat cop Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson) idiotic Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson (Paul Gleason) and interfering FBI Agents Big (Robert Davi) and Little (Grand L. Bush) Johnson. The Christmas wreath for best performance of the film has to go to Alan Rickman though. He so rarely shows up in fun genre stuff like this, and his presence always chromes up whatever the film is to perfection. He plays absolutely evil German psychopath Hans Gruber, leader of the terrorists and bane of Mcclane's existence, just the rotten murdering bastard you hope to see in the villain slot in every film like this. The shining example that all action films should aspire to be, the zenith of slam bang flicks, and a good dose of Christmas cheer too. Yippee ki yay motherfvcker",10.0,Anonymous,Action
